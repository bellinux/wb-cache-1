40|$|The {{prepress}} {{industry has}} witnessed unprecedented {{change over the}} last decade. Economic changes in the prepress industry have caused publishers of short run publications to depend {{on a variety of}} sources for <b>color</b> <b>proofing</b> materials. <b>Color</b> <b>proofs</b> can be supplied from as many as fifty different proofing systems. Advertisers now provide complete and partial advertisements directly to the publication printer. These changes have caused not only a reorganization of work flow in publication printers, but a need to examine more stringent rules concerning the variety of <b>color</b> <b>proofs</b> accepted for one publication. <b>Color</b> <b>proofs,</b> which are used for on press color approval, are supplied from three primary sources: Proofs produced by the publisher 2 ̆ 7 s on site production department Proofs supplied by the publisher 2 ̆ 7 s service bureau(s) Proofs supplied by the publisher 2 ̆ 7 s advertiser The publication printer 2 ̆ 7 s task is to receive supplied materials, process these materials through the production process and use these materials for on-press color approval. Contractual arrangements between the publisher and the publication printer exist which establish how, and to what extent materials will be processed, or examined. These processes depend upon the submission of 2 ̆ 2 accurate 2 ̆ 2 <b>color</b> <b>proofs.</b> Lack of training of the publication printer 2 ̆ 7 s personnel, and film and film related issues result in the processing of unacceptable proofs through the production progress. Proofs that do not accurately represent desired color are used as press color target. The author hypothesizes that the greater the variety of <b>color</b> <b>proofs</b> used, the more likely a color quality complaint will be submitted. The use of such proofs results in inferior or unacceptable product being produced on press. A publication printer that produces a range of publications exists as a microcosm of the printing industry. Three publications produced at a color publication printer will be evaluated as to type of proofs submitted for issues produced for distribution in 1997 - 1998. These publications will be called publication A, publication B, and publication C. All three publications use supplied proofs received from film houses, advertisers, or are customer generated proofs. Proofs produced by the printer will not be considered. Customer color quality complaints for these publications will be gathered so a degree of customer dissatisfaction can be quantified. Customer complaints exist in three formats: Written complaints submitted by the publisher Verbal complaints documented by the customer service representative through quality complaint inquiries. The submission of marked up copies showing folio pages considered 2 ̆ 2 less than acceptable 2 ̆ 2 quality. Information gathered will be evaluated and a conclusion will be made about whether publications with a greater variety of <b>color</b> <b>proofs</b> received a higher number of quality complaints...|$|R

40|$|As such, {{the use of}} ∆E LAB {{to specify}} color {{tolerances}} of ink has been common in the graphic arts. However, {{there is no easy}} way to assess color difference quantitatively between two complex images, e. g., a pictorial <b>color</b> <b>proof</b> and its corresponding press sheet. Consequently, the practice of qualifying a color proofing system which conforms to a known printing condition or verifying printed products that match a contract proof remains visual and subjective. This paper uses a standard press characterization target (IT 8. 7 / 3 basic block) to quantify pictorial color image difference by colorimetry. Colorimetric measurement conditions and ∆E(LAB) calculations adhere to the ANSI CGATS. 5 - 1993 standard. Comparison of color images with the same colorant conditions and images with different colorant conditions were investigated. The quantitative analysis mainly focuses on the use of cumulative relative frequency (CRF) of the ∆E distribution. We learned that a visual match between two color images can be specified by means of the CRF curve and its derived statistics. In addition, a visual match between two color images imposes a tighter colorimetric tolerance than process conformance as specified by solid ink density and dot gain...|$|E
40|$|Color {{transparency}} film is {{the most}} frequently used original material in the color separation process. Recent technological advances in color negative film and electronic color generated scanners capable of working from a color negative have led to new avenues of exploration in the area of color separation. By using a color negative film as the original {{it may be possible to}} produce color separations of equal or higher quality than those produced from color transparencies. This research project has investigated the possibility that a set of color separations made from an Eastman Kodak Ektar color negative could yield a set of color separation proofs of equal or superior quality to those made from an Eastman Kodak Kodachrome color transparency. The attributes that were investigated were image detail, color saturation and tone reproduction. A total of six original scenes were photographed by the author; six using Kodachrome 25 - 35 mm slide film- and six using Ektar 25 - 35 mm negative film. Four of the original images were photographed at the same time in a controlled studio environment. The remaining two images were photographed outdoors to include a normal exterior scene. Twelve color separations were then generated using the Royal Zenith 210 -L color scanner. These twelve separations were then proofed using the DuPont Cromalin proofing system. The last stage of the study involved a visual evaluation by thirty judges with professional experience in either the fields of photography or printing. Under standard viewing conditions, the thirty judges simultaneously compared a <b>color</b> <b>proof</b> created from a Kodachrome original against a <b>color</b> <b>proof</b> created from an Ektar color negative original of the same scene. They were asked to examine the six sets of color proofs and select the one from each set that they judged to be superior for the criteria of: image detad, color saturation and tone reproduction. Their evaluations were then recorded using a carefully designed response sheet. The results of this experiment indicated that there was no significant difference for the criteria of image detail and tone reproduction between the proofs generated from an Ektar color negative and the proofs generated from a Kodachrome color transparency. For the specific criteria of color saturation the study indicated that the proofs generated from an Ektar color negative were significantly better than the proofs generated from a Kodachrome color transparency. The data indicates that under the conditions tested, it makes little difference in the final proofed images whether the camera original material used is Ektar color negative film or Kodachrome color transparency...|$|E
40|$|Background: In 2013, {{an unusually}} high {{incidence}} of biliary tract cancer among current or former workers of the offset <b>color</b> <b>proof</b> printing department of a printing company in Osaka, Japan, was reported. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether distance from the printing factory was associated with incidence of biliary tract cancer and whether incident biliary tract cancer cases clustered around the printing factory in Osaka using population-based cancer registry data. Methods: We estimated the age-standardized incidence ratio of biliary tract cancer according to distance from this printing factory. We also searched for clusters of biliary tract cancer incidence using spatial scan statistics. Results: We did not observe statistically significantly high or low standardized incidence ratios for residents in each area categorized by distance from the printing factory for the entire sample or for either sex. The scan statistics did not show any statistically significant clustering of biliary tract cancer incidence anywhere in Osaka prefecture in 2004 – 2007. Conclusions: There was no statistically significant clustering of biliary tract cancer incidence around the printing factory or in any other areas in Osaka, Japan, between 2004 and 2007. To date, even if some substances have diffused outside this source factory, they do not appear to have influenced the incidence of biliary tract cancer in neighboring residents...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to quantitatively analyze off-press <b>color</b> <b>proofing</b> methods for {{advertising}} material appearing in halftone publication gravure printing. This type of proofing has been an area of debate for the publications industry, especially in reference to the print quality of advertising material. The correlation between dot gain characteristics and the resulting color differences of off-press <b>color</b> <b>proofing</b> methods has been the center of greatest controversy. This paper has tested to determine if a correlation exists between dot gain characteristics and the resulting colorimetric-matching ability for <b>color</b> <b>proofing</b> methods used in halftone publication gravure. The variable dot-gain feature of an electrophotographic proofing system was tested to determine if this feature improved the color matching ability of the off-press proof to the SWOP offset press proof. This system was analyzed by its 2 ̆ 7 ability to objectively match the SWOP offset press proof for dot gain aimpoints. These aimpoints are used as the quality control tool for advertising material appearing in both halftone gravure and web offset publications printing. The experiment concluded that the dot gain characteristic curve of the electrophotographic off-press proof could be altered to quantitatively match closer to the dot gain of an offset press proof printed to SWOP/GAA Specifications. However, the data did not completely support the authors 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis. A direct correlation between dot gain and the resulting delta E values could not be established. None of the data collected from the electrophotographic test sets completely proved that a change in dot gain produced a closer colorimetric match to the SWOP/GAA Offset Press Proof...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{is a report}} on the research of a potentially superior method of color image transformation for producing rapid and accurate printed color output from a digitized color image. The primary objective is to reduce the complexities, inaccuracies, objectionable artifacts, and processing time common to current methods of color modeling. A new method of vector-corrected mathematical modeling combined with improved color space interpolation is studied. This achievement allows for rapid automatic closed-loop color-match calibration between image capture and output devices. Currently, digital image creation or manipulation systems rely on image proof printing which is slow and often of poor color fidelity or proprietary. The ideal system would provide optimum color reproduction fidelity and rapid proof printing at a low cost. Existing systems often rely on mathematical models for image con version for printing. These models are usually a bottleneck in the proofing process and are not accurate enough for many applica tions. Increasing their accuracy rapidly increases processing time to the point of impracticality well before graphic arts quality levels are achieved. A common solution to this problem in larger systems is a massive and tediously generated color look-up table based on actual measured print samples. This method is costly and does not readily accommodate printing process changes such as paper grade or ink color. Attempts {{to reduce the size of}} these look-up tables and the large quantity of required sample measurements have been disappointing. In this thesis, new methods will be reported which should allow practical small-system <b>color</b> <b>proof</b> printing with excellent color fidelity and rapid processing. By eliminating common problems associated with color space interpolation, these new methods make closed-loop control practical with a relatively small quantity of sample measurements which can be automatically printed, scanned, and incorporated into conversion processes...|$|E
