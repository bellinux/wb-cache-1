40|$|One idea {{to explain}} the mysterious dark energy which appears to pervade the Universe {{is that it is}} due to a network of domain walls which has frozen into some kind of static configuration, akin to a soap film. Such models predict an {{equation}} of state with w=P/rho=- 2 / 3 and can be represented in cosmological perturbation theory by an elastic medium with rigidity and a relativistic sound speed. An important question is whether such a network can be created from random initial conditions. We consider various models which allow the formation of domain walls, and present results from an extensive set of numerical investigations. The idea is to give a mechanism which prevents the natural propensity of domain walls to collapse and lose energy, almost to the point where a domain wall network freezes in. We show that when domain walls couple to a field with a conserved charge, there is a parameter range for which <b>charge</b> <b>condenses</b> onto the domain walls, providing a resistive force to the otherwise natural collapse of the wallsComment: Proceedings of the 45 th Rencontres de Moriond, cosmology conferenc...|$|R

Although it has been well established that like-charged macromolecules can aggregate {{under the influence of}} oppositely <b>charged</b> <b>condensing</b> agents, the specific conditions for the stability of such aggregates can only be determined empirically. We examine these conditions, which involve an interplay of electrostatic and osmotic effects, by using a well defined model system composed of F-actin, an anionic rod-like polyelectrolyte, and lysozyme, a cationic globular protein with a charge that can be genetically modified. The structure and stability of actin–lysozyme complexes for different lysozyme charge mutants and salt concentrations are examined by using synchrotron x-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations. We provide evidence that supports a structural transition from columnar arrangements of F-actin held together by arrays of lysozyme at the threefold interstitial sites of the actin sublattice to marginally stable complexes in which lysozyme resides at twofold bridging sites between actin. The reduced stability arises from strongly reduced partitioning of salt between the complex and the surrounding solution. Changes in the stability of actin–lysozyme complexes are of biomedical interest because their formation has been reported to contribute to the persistence of airway infections in cystic fibrosis by sequestering antimicrobials such as lysozyme. We present x-ray microscopy results that argue for the existence of actin–lysozyme complexes in cystic fibrosis sputum and demonstrate that, {{for a wide range of}} salt conditions, charge-reduced lysozyme is not sequestered in ordered complexes while retaining its bacterial killing activity...|$|R

This phenomenon has been studied extensively using chiral Lagrangians. Here the two-flavor NJL model at theta = pi is discussed.

The dependence of the phase structure, and in particular of the CP-violating phase, on the quark masses, temperature, baryon and isospin chemical potential is examined in detail.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} mechanism(s) {{for high}} oven-wall pressure {{are still not}} completely understood. The hypothesis put forward in this series of papers is that bubble-growth combined {{with a lack of}} bubble-coalescence in the plastic-layer is the primary reason for high oven-wall pressure, and that a lack of bubble-coalescence occurs when the minimum viscosity and elasticity are above a certain threshold. Because it is known that coal oxidation decreases its fluidity, an examination of the changes to both viscoelastic properties of the plastic-layer and oven-wall pressure during the coking of oxidised coals was considered to be a promising way to test the hypothesis, as most of the other properties of the coal, such as volatile matter, remain unaltered. Viscoelastic properties were measured using high-temperature oscillatory shear rheometry. For the fresh coals studied, the viscoelastic properties were such that bubble-growth and bubble-coalescence occurred and the oven-wall pressure was low. After subjecting the coal to enhanced oxidation, the minimum viscosity and elasticity increased to a level whereby bubble-growth occurred but bubble-coalescence did not. A large increase in OWP was found to coincide with this change. It is envisaged that bubble-coalescence enables channels to form in the plastic-layer and that the continuous release of volatiles keeps the channels open. Therefore, bubble-coalescence is considered to strongly influence gas permeability. When gas permeability through the semi-coke is severely restricted, volatiles would be forced to move to the centre of the <b>charge,</b> <b>condense,</b> and then revolatilise as the temperature rises, leading to high late OWP peaks. If oxidation was allowed to progress further, it is anticipated that viscosity and elasticity would increase to a level whereby bubble-growth would be restricted and OWP would not be high, but the coke would be highly non-fused and very weak. These results may elucidate why variable OWP results are found for different coals before and after oxidation; it depends on the initial and final viscoelastic properties. For another coal, OWP remained low a...|$|R

Strong phonon anharmonicity induced by electron-phonon coupling is discovered within ab initio calculations which take into account local Coulomb interactions at Fe ions.
