40|$|Few {{long and}} well-dated summer {{precipitation}} reconstructions that {{extend beyond the}} longest records of instrumental measurements exist in Europe. Further understanding of the past trends in summer precipitation and the mechanisms driving that variability are necessary to improve the predictions of climate models. Tree rings are unique {{in their ability to}} provide high-resolution, absolutely dated climate signals for the study of palaeoclimatology. The physiological processes controlling oxygen isotope composition (δ 18 O) in wood are reasonably well understood highlighting its potential as a climate proxy in a variety of environments. Significant correlation between wood δ 18 O and precipitation has been demonstrated worldwide reflecting both direct rainout processes and indirectly evaporative enrichment. We present an annually resolved reconstruction of precipitation based upon oxygen isotope variations in tree ring <b>cellulose</b> <b>covering</b> the most recent ∼ 400 years for England. The May–August precipitation series, which was formed by combining reconstructed values based on oxygen isotope composition (δ 18 O) in tree ring cellulose of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) (1613 – 1893) and instrumental data (1894 – 2003), indicates significant decadal and centennial precipitation variability culminating in dry conditions in the early-middle 17 th century and the late 20 th century. The analysis demonstrated statistically robust May–August precipitation signal in the δ 18 O values of oak cellulose back to 1697, {{the first year of the}} oldest instrumental precipitation series in England...|$|E
5000|$|In {{more modern}} applications, {{microbial}} cellulose has become relevant {{in the medical}} sector. It has been tested and successfully used as a wound dressing, especially in burn cases. Studies have shown that burns treated with microbial <b>cellulose</b> <b>coverings</b> healed faster than traditional treatments and had less scaring. The microbial cellulose topical applications are effective due to the cellulose's water holding ability and water vapor permeability. The high water holding ability provides a moist atmosphere at the injury site, which is critical in healing, while the wicking ability allows seepage from the wound {{to be removed from}} the site. Also, the microbial cellulose molds very well {{to the surface of the}} skin, providing a conformal covering even in usually difficult places to dress wounds, such as areas on the face. This technique has been so successful that commercial microbial cellulose products, such as Biofill ®, have been developed. [...] Another microbial cellulose commercial treatment product is XCell produced by the Xylos Corporation, which is mainly used to treat wounds from venous ulcers. [...] Studies have also been performed where traditional gauze dressings are treated with a microbial cellulose biopolymer to enhance the properties of the gauze. In addition to increasing the drying time and water holding abilities, liquid medicines were able to be absorbed by the microbial cellulose coated gauze, allowing them to work at the injury site.|$|R

40|$|Cellulose nanocrystals, a {{class of}} {{fascinating}} bio-based nanoscale materials, have received {{a tremendous amount of}} interest both in industry and academia owing to its unique structural features and impressive physicochemical properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, renewability, low density, adaptable surface chemistry, optical transparency, and improved mechanical properties. This nanomaterial is a promising candidate for applications in fields such as biomedical, pharmaceuticals, electronics, barrier films, nanocomposites, membranes, supercapacitors, etc. New resources, new extraction procedures, and new treatments are currently under development to satisfy the increasing demand of manufacturing new types of cellulose nanocrystals-based materials on an industrial scale. Therefore, this review addresses the recent progress in the production methodologies of <b>cellulose</b> nanocrystals, <b>covering</b> principal <b>cellulose</b> resources and the main processes used for its isolation. A critical and analytical examination of the shortcomings of various approaches employed so far is made. Additionally, structural organization of cellulose and nomenclature of cellulose nanomaterials have also been discussed for beginners in this field...|$|R
30|$|Nanoparticles, {{which have}} {{polymers}} covalently {{attached to their}} surface, are known as Polymer-Coated Nanoparticles (PNPs). PNPs are nanoparticles whose surface has been functionalized or modified with polymer materials [41]. While some polymeric coatings can stabilize nanoparticles, they cannot prevent their adsorption on rock surfaces. The strength of nanoparticles with coatings of polyelectrolyte is also affected by the increase in salinity and pH. The use of elongated polymer chains like starch, polyacrylamide or <b>cellulose</b> as <b>covering</b> on a nanoparticle surface to make them stable in solution has not been successful at high salinities in most reservoirs because of poor solubility of the polymers. PNPs {{have been shown to}} behave in a different way under static and dynamic conditions. ShamsiJazeyi et al. [40] also mentioned the behavior of solutions of iron nanoparticles coated with poly (acrylic acid) and its transport along a porous media. It was discovered that nanoparticle size depends on the number of nanoparticles under dynamic conditions and not static. It was concluded that the forces acting on nanoparticles under dynamic conditions are absent under static conditions. This reflects how complex the effects of flow rate, permeability, etc. on nanoparticles under dynamic conditions and using static conditions to validate the chemical stability of nanoparticles may not be sufficient. The propagation of well-stabilized functionalized nanoparticles in porous media may be hindered and retarded by adsorption on the rock surface [40, 48]. PNPs, which have a charged surface, which {{is the same as the}} rock surface or less hydrophobic, may show less adsorption. This can be challenging given the salinities and divalent ion concentration present in most oil reservoirs. Table  2 shows a summary of some experimental works done on Nano-EOR.|$|R
30|$|Yu et al. (2010) {{investigated}} the essential carriage and retaining properties of nanoparticles under extreme salinity {{by means of}} real core supplies. The stability of the nanoparticles {{was found to be}} reliant on the amount of communication amongst nanoparticles, a solution containing salt ions and exterior of the porous medium, which affects retention and retardation. The presence of divalent ions may affect the propagation of nanoparticles through the formation of “salt-bridge” between the ions and the nanoparticle (Ogolo et al. 2012). Retention of nanoparticles on the exterior of rocks is as a result of charge communication amongst the nanoparticles and the exterior of the rock. Carbon nanoparticles, which are essentially negatively charge, were discovered not to be retained on sandstone mineral during a transport study of carbon nanoparticles (Ogolo et al. 2012). This may be due to electrostatic force of repulsion amongst the sandstone minerals, which are charged negatively, and the negatively stimulated carbon nanoparticles. Nanoparticles, which have polymers covalently attached to its surface, are known as polymer-coated nanoparticles (PNPs). PNPs can be seen as nanoparticles whose surface has been functionalized or modified with polymer materials (Subbiah et al. 2010). While some polymeric coatings can stabilize nanoparticles, they cannot prevent their adsorption on rock surfaces. The strength of nanoparticles with coatings of polyelectrolyte is also affected by the increase in salinity and pH.
