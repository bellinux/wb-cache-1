But there are few articles to study the kind of phosphorus source to crop growth. This study was implemented to investigate the effects of land application of a few kind phosphate fertilizers (such as superphosphate, triple superphosphate, fused phosphate, <b>calcined</b> <b>phosphate,</b> apatite) and rates on soil cadmium fractionation and growth of vegetables. 增施磷肥通常被用來抑制土壤中重金屬鎘的活性，降低植物對鎘的吸收和積累，但對於不同磷源對鎘污染土壤上植物生長的影響，以及不同磷源本身所含鎘量對土壤鎘污染之貢獻卻鮮少有相關報導。磷肥重金屬含量往往相當高，在宣導農民合理施肥降低磷肥用量以降低重金屬進入土壤外，亦須了解，磷肥中重金屬進入土壤後的變化及對土壤與作物的影響，才能訂定磷肥重金屬含量之管制值。本研究擬探討不同磷肥種類與用量對土壤中鎘型態及作物生長之影響。同時分析市售磷肥(包括過磷酸鈣、重過磷酸鈣、熔磷、磷礦石粉、含磷複合肥料) 重金屬型態(例如全量、水溶性、檸檬酸溶性) 、鹼度、酸度等基本會影響土壤性質之化學性質...|$|E

The specific surface area and the pore volume were determined by nitrogen adsorption. Raw particles and calcined ores were leached using dilute phosphoric acid solution (4 % P 2 O 5). In all cases, the ESEM (Environmental Scanning Elec-tron Microscopy) observations show that the grain of phosphate holds its shape ovoidale. The sample heated at 780 ˚C presented the lowest specific surface area 0. 6 m 2 /g at each reaction time, and the unreacted phases were analysed using XRD, FT-IR, Nitrogen adsorption and ESEM observations. The selective leaching curves were evaluated in order to test the validity of kinetics models. A mathematical model in the following form was ap-plied: (() − − =ln 1 α mkt). The dissolution of the two samples (raw and <b>calcined</b> <b>phosphate)</b> has been observed to take place in two steps: the first being fast and the second being slow...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the wet {{phosphoric acid}} {{production}} using <b>calcined</b> <b>phosphate</b> particles, physical structure and chemical composition of used material {{have an impact on}} the reaction speed. In this study, porous properties of phosphate fraction size 125 - 200 mum after heating at different temperature between 240 degreesC to 940 degreesC were investigated. Fluorapatite, carbonate fluorapatite (Francolite), dolomite and calcite constitute the major minerals of the phosphate rock used. The results of TG/DTA, CRTA, IP, and ESEM observations were used to understand the chemical changes observed. The decline of the specific surface area (SSA) from 16. 61 m(2) /g down to 0. 81 m(2) /g was interpreted according to the thermal results. The increasing of the linear shrinkage % by sintering process is observed. This process begins near 240 degreesC and reaches a maximum near 940 degreesC. These results are in agreement with those in the literature. Some kinetic tests were undertaken at laboratory scale to elucidate the relationship between reactivity and porous properties of phosphate particles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Alkyl phosphates, the {{products}} from the reaction between phosphorous pentoxide and various alcohols, were used as the in-situ templates of nanostructure as well as phosphorus source of HAP. The obtained precursor samples had ordered nanostructures:lamellar structure for dodecyl and n-octyl phospahes templated samples, cubic for n-pentyl and hexagonal for ethyl phosphates templated samples. The <b>calcined</b> ethyl <b>phosphate</b> templated sample was pure HAP with a specific surface area of 42 m 2 /g, and sustained with an orderly hexagonal nanostructure at 400 °C. But the calcination at 400 °C caused the collapse of other alkyl phosphates templated nanostructures...|$|R
40|$|The {{specific}} chemical, {{structural and}} morphological properties of calcium phosphates are highly {{sensitive to the}} changes of synthesis conditions. As many characteristics, e. g., purity, solubility, bioactivity, depend on chemical composition and crystal structure of synthesized calcium phosphates it has been studied extensively during last year. Influence of technological parameters on chemical composition of as-prepared and <b>calcined</b> calcium <b>phosphates</b> samples was investigated. Calcium phosphates powders have been synthesized by wet-chemical precipitation rout using CaCO 3 and H 3 PO 4 as starting materials. These synthesis series vary with following technological parameters: temperature of the suspension {{during the process of}} synthesis (T, °C), ending pH value, aging time of suspension (τ, h) and thermal processing (T, °C; τ, h). The identification and characterization of obtained calcium phosphates powders chemical composition has been made with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy method. FT-IR spectra of as-synthesized calcium phosphates powders showed characteristic chemical bands (PO 4 3 -, OH-, H 2 O absorbed, CO 32 -, HPO 4 2 -) at definite wave number ranges. The as-synthesized powders are non-stoichiometric hydroxylapatite (HAp) with the presence of CO 3 2 -, OH- and H 2 O absorbed bands. Carbonate and OH- absorbed bands can be perfectly removed after calcination above 900 °C. The experimental results of X-ray diffraction and FT-IR spectra have shown the presence of biphasic mixtures containing HAp and β-tricalciumphosphate (β-TCP). The secondary phase of β-TCP was also formed after HAp samples heating at 1000 °C and above...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal {{treatment}} of the hydroxyapatite powders on the micropore structure of porous biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) granules was examined. The porous BCP granules could be attained through mixing and sinter ing/fracturing thermally treated 60 wt% hydroxyapatite powders and calcined 40 wt% β -tricalcium phosphate powders. The observed Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) morphologies showed that the density of micropores (0. 1 - 2. 0 μm) including interconnected micropores of the porous BCP granules mixed with hydroxyapatite powders thermally treated at 900 °C was significantly improved and the composite particles of porous BCP granules were homogeneously mixed and distributed. This result indicates that the particles of hydroxyapatite powders that {{have a tendency to}} agglomerate at a room temperature were well isolated and dispersed through thermal treatment processing before mixing with <b>calcined</b> β -tricalcium <b>phosphate</b> powders. The microstructural characterizations such as phase purity and composition of porous BCP granules were performed and verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis. </p...|$|R
30|$|Many {{researchers}} have conducted studies on various methods {{for the removal}} of heavy metals from waters and wastewaters. Conventional physicochemical methods such as electrochemical treatment, ion-exchange, precipitation, reverse osmosis, evaporation and oxidation/reduction for heavy metal removal from waste streams are expensive, not eco-friendly and inefficient for metal removal from dilute solutions containing from 1 to 100  mg/l of dissolved metal (Montazer-Rahmati et al. 2011). Efficient and environmental friendly technologies are, therefore, need to be developed to reduce heavy metal contents in wastewaters to acceptable levels at inexpensive costs (Saeed and Iqbal 2003). One alternate effective process is the adsorption which relies on the utilization of solid adsorbents with no chemical degradation. It is attractive due to its merits of effectiveness, efficiency and free sludge (Chu and Chen 2002). Among the various adsorbents, adsorption onto activated carbon (granular or powdered) is widely used; there is still a need to develop low cost and easily available adsorbents {{for the removal of}} heavy metal ions from the aqueous environment (Chauhan and Sankararamakrishnan 2011). Hence in recent years, research has been focused on the use of various low cost adsorbents including <b>calcined</b> <b>phosphate</b> (Aklil et al. 2004), activated hazelnut shell ash (Bayrak et al. 2006), orange peel (Feng et al. 2011), black gram husk (Saeed and Iqbal 2003), Coir pith (Ramesh et al. 2011 a, 2011 b), plants (Benhima et al. 2008; Chiban et al. 2009, 2011 a, b, c, 2012), etc.|$|E
40|$|Pasture is {{the main}} form of land use in Amazonia. Over time the pasture grass loses vigor and yields decrease, {{indicating}} {{a certain degree of}} degeneration. The main causes of degradation are lack of pasture maintenance and subsequent weed infestation, the choice of regionally unsuitable forage species and excessive grazing. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the impact of different recovery managements on soil chemical properties and grass yield of a degraded pasture in Rondônia. For this purpose, an experiment was installed in October 2001, consisting of five treatments: C = control; HA = harrowing + NPK + micronutrients; HE = Herbicide + NK + micronutrients; R = No-tillage rice + NPK + micronutrients; and S = No-tillage soybean + PK + micronutrients. The following N, P and K sources were used: ammonium sulfate for N, <b>calcined</b> <b>phosphate</b> for P and potassium chloride for K. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. The shoot dry matter yield of the grass was analyzed as of the 35 th month of experimentation, in a dry and a rainy period. Phosphorus fertilization resulted in significant increases in Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + and increasing trend of P in the topsoil in the initial months of the experiment in treatments HA and S and increases in Ca 2 + and P (trend) in the treatment R. The cumulative production of Brachiaria brizantha, from Sep/ 2004 to Mar/ 2005, was 30, 025, 28, 267 and 27, 735 kg ha- 1 shoot dry matter in the treatments HA, R and S, respectively. These values differed significantly from treatments C and HE, with 17, 040 and 17, 057 kg ha- 1, respectively. It was concluded that phosphorus fertilization associated to pasture reform was effective to raise the dry matter yield of Brachiaria brizantha. Rice or soybean under no-tillage is recommended as a practice of pasture recovery, due to the residual effect of fertilization...|$|E
40|$|Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} agronomic effectiveness of <b>calcined</b> nonapatite <b>phosphate</b> rock (PR) sources containing crandallite minerals in the form of Ca-Fe-Al-P for flooded and upland rice (Oryza sativa L.). We conducted laboratory and greenhouse studies to (i) characterize the mineralogical composition, (ii) investigate the solubility and dissolution behavior, and (iii) evaluate the agronomic effectiveness of two nonapatite PR sources (Juquia and Sapucaia) from Brazil and compared them with (i) a highly reactive Gafsa PR (Tunisia) containing apatite in the form of Ca-P and (ii) a reference water-soluble triple superphosphate (TSP) for flooded and upland rice. After calcination at 500 degrees C for 4 h, the solubility of Juquia PR and Sapucaia PR in neutral ammonium citrate (NAC) significantly increased from almost nil to a maximum of 39. 3 and 114 g P kg(- 1), respectively. X-ray diffraction showed that crystalline crandallite mineral was transformed to an amophorus form after calcination. The solubility behavior of the two calcined PR sources followed the same trend as Gafsa PR, that is, P release decreased with increasing equilibrium pH in the 0. 01 M KCl solution (PH 3. 0 - 8. 0). At PH 3, the solubility followed: Gafsa PR > calcined Sapucaia PR > calcined Juquia PR. No P release was detected from any of the PR sources at pH >= 5. 0 in the solution, indicating the Ca-P characteristic of the Ca-Fe-Al-P mineral controlled P dissolution of the calcined PR. Without calcination, both Juquia PR and Sapucaia PR were totally ineffective for upland rice grown on a Hiwassee clay loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Rhodic Kanhapludult) with pH 5. 4 whereas a significant P response was observed with the calcined PR samples. For flooded rice grown on Hiwassee soil, the calcined Juquia PR and Sapucaia PR were 66 and 72 %, respectively, as effective as TSP in increasing rice grain yield whereas Gafsa PR was ineffective. For upland rice grown on the unlimed soil, Gafsa PR was as effective as TSP in increasing rice grain yield whereas calcined Juquia PR and Sapucaia PR were 89 and 83 % of TSP. The effectiveness of Gafsa PR was reduced to 0 % after the soil was limed to pH 7. 0 whereas the two calcined PR sources were reduced to 49 % of TSP. Soil available P extracted by iron oxide impregnated filter paper (Pi test) or anion-exchange resin after rice harvest correlated well with P uptake by rice grain for flooded and upland rice...|$|R
