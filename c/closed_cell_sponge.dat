40|$|Marine sponges are a {{rich source}} of {{bioactive}} compounds with pharmaceutical potential and are the most prolific source of newly discovered bioactive compounds with more than 7, 000 novel molecules discovered in 40 years. Despite its enormous potential, only a few sponge-derived bioactive compounds have been successfully developed into products. A major obstacle is the lack of sufficient supply of biological material for preclinical and clinical development. An option to supply materials for early drug development is production by the sponge, <b>sponge</b> tissue, <b>sponge</b> <b>cells</b> and/or the <b>sponge</b> symbionts. The main challenge with this is to establish generic techniques for small-scale production of sponge biomass. This thesis focuses on gaining insight in cell proliferation and <b>cell</b> death of <b>sponge</b> <b>cell</b> cultures and making the first step towards a continuous <b>sponge</b> <b>cell</b> culture for biotechnological purposes, such as the production of bioactive compounds. In chapter 2 “Cultivation of <b>sponges,</b> <b>sponge</b> <b>cells</b> and symbionts: achievements and future prospects”, we analyzed {{the state of the art}} for cultivation of whole <b>sponges,</b> <b>sponge</b> <b>cells</b> and <b>sponge</b> symbionts for biotechnological purposes and we elaborate on approaches to overcome bottlenecks, including transformation of <b>sponge</b> <b>cells</b> and using media based on yolk. In chapter 3 “Cell cycle analysis of primary <b>sponge</b> <b>cell</b> cultures”, we discussed the development of a flow cytometric cell cycle analysis method to measure the proliferative state of <b>sponge</b> <b>cells,</b> in combination with a caspase assay to detect apoptosis. These methods allowed for a quick determination of the proliferative status of a <b>sponge</b> <b>cell</b> population. We analyzed the cell cycle distribution of five different species (Haliclona oculata, Haliclona xena, Dysidea avara, Axinella polypoides andXestospongia muta) from different locations to compare the proliferative status at the start of the culture. In addition, we measured the cell cycle distribution and caspase activities of cells from H. oculata during cultivation to study the change in distribution of cells over time. Subsequently in chapter 4 “Toward development of a <b>sponge</b> <b>cell</b> line: comparison of <b>cell</b> proliferation in <b>sponge</b> <b>cell</b> and tissue cultures”, we used the developed methods from chapter 2 to compare culture conditions of two Mediterranean sponges (D. avara and Crambe crambe) and one Dutch sponge (H. oculata). We hypothesized that in vitro tissue culture will be a more favorable culture condition than cell culture, because the dissociation process is avoided, meaning the cells are not exposed to shear stress and the cell-cell contacts are retained. As a control we also included tissue culture in the sea (in situ) to test, in case of lack of growth, whether this is due to the cutting of the sponge into tissue pieces or to environmental conditions that are different in the sea compared to the in vitro culture. In chapter 5 “Methods for insertion and expression of heterologous genes in sponge cells”, we made the first step towards immortalization of <b>sponge</b> <b>cells</b> by comparing different methods for the insertion and expression of heterologous genes in sponge. We tested three gene delivery systems, lipofection, particle bombardment and viral transduction, in juveniles of the freshwater sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis, and lipofection was tested in primary cell cultures of the marine sponge H. oculata. Juveniles of E. fluviatilis were chosen as a model sponge for this research, because they are able to proliferate in vitro. To visualize transfection efficacy, we used the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. To test promoter recognition by sponge RNA polymerase, we tested the cytomegalovirus (CMV) and OpIE 2 promoter, which are generally used for transfection of mammalian cells and insect cells, respectively. Finally in chapter 6 “Genomic based approach for <b>sponge</b> <b>cell</b> culture”, we provided an outlook on how recent developments in the field of genomics and transcriptomics can help us to gain more insight in sponge growth and death and consequently obtain a continuous <b>sponge</b> <b>cell</b> line...|$|R

Small closed, large <b>closed</b> and open <b>cells</b> were identified in about 65 % of the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) satellite images during 2003. The MODIS imagery was combined with ceilometer and surface meteorological measurements, human observations of cloud types and drizzle, and large-scale meteorological analyses for January through June. We identified two drizzle regimes: a synoptically-quiescent summer (Jan-March) regime characterized by a strong anticyclone, large <b>closed</b> <b>cells,</b> and frequent drizzle, and an autumn (April-June) regime characterized by a weaker anticyclone, small <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> and open cells, and precipitation that was mainly associated with synoptic activity. The large <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> had higher mean cloud bases and tops than the small <b>closed</b> <b>cells,</b> accounted for 45 % of the cumulus-under- stratocumulus reports, and 29 % of the total drizzle and rain reports. Large <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> occupied more intermittently-coupled boundary layers than did the small <b>closed</b> <b>cells.</b> Open cells also occurred in more decoupled conditions, but only accounted for 18 % of the total reports of drizzle and rain. The atmospheric stability of large and small <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> were similar, but large <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> were more commonly associated with a strong anticyclone, and small <b>closed</b> <b>cells</b> with wave activity superimposed upon a weakened anticyclone.

The five sponges studied in this paper all showed a large fraction of cells in G 1 /G 0 compared to G 2 /M and S, indicating that cells were not actively dividing. In addition, some sponges also showed a large apoptotic fraction, indicating cell death. Additional apoptosis measurements, based on caspase activity, showed that harvesting and dissociation of sponge tissue to initiate a primary cell culture was directly correlated with an increase in apoptotic cells. This indicates that for the development of cell cultures, more attention should be given to harvesting, dissociation, and quality of starting material.

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the phenomena of <b>sponge</b> <b>cell</b> recognition. When fully grown sponges {{belonging to the}} same species are brought into contact, either naturally or by an experimental process, they fuse into a single organism. In {{the absence of any}} circulatory system, the ability for cellular recognition resides in the cell surface and is expressed when cells come into contact. This characteristic of sponges and the readiness, with which the sponges can be dissociated into cellular suspension, led to the main experimental work on cellular recognition in these organisms— that is, the studies on the aggregating behavior of dissociated <b>sponge</b> <b>cells.</b> The technique of cell aggregation is very useful, as it allows the mixing of cell suspensions of different kinds and proportions, and because a large number of cells can be brought simultaneously into contact. Purification and characterization of <b>sponge</b> <b>cell</b> aggregating factors was first attempted in Microciona prolifera and Haliclona occulata. Glycopeptides extracted from whole sponges with trichloroacetic acid were antigenic and that they elicited in rabbits precipitating and agglutinating antisera specific for the homologous cells. Some phenomena, involved in <b>sponge</b> <b>cell</b> recognition, were investigated during the reaggregation of the dissociated cells. It is pointed out that in <b>sponges</b> <b>cell,</b> recognition occurs at three levels—namely, cell type specificity, intraspecific recognition, and interspecific recognition. © 1975, Academic Press Inc.
