25|$|A <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> or {{traverse}} rod is {{a device}} used to suspend curtains, usually above windows or {{along the edges}} of showers, though also wherever curtains might be used. The flat, telescoping <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> was invented by Charles W. Kirsch of Sturgis, Michigan, in 1907. However, they were not in use until the 1920s. Kirsch also invented the traverse <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> in 1928.|$|E
500|$|Stella Nickell {{was born}} Stella Maudine Stephenson in Colton, Oregon, to Alva Georgia [...] "Jo" [...] (née Duncan; later changed {{her name to}} Cora Lee) and George Stephenson, and grew up poor. By age sixteen, she was {{pregnant}} with her daughter Cynthia. Nickell then moved to Southern California, married, and had another daughter. She began to have various legal troubles, including a conviction for fraud in 1968, a charge the following year of beating Cynthia with a <b>curtain</b> <b>rod,</b> and a conviction for forgery in 1971. She served six months in jail for the fraud charge, and was ordered into counseling after the abuse charge.|$|E

50|$|<b>Curtain</b> <b>rods</b> {{can be made}} of many {{materials}} including- wood, {{metal and}} plastic. <b>Curtain</b> <b>rods</b> come in almost endless styles and designs. Not all <b>curtain</b> <b>rods</b> are simple straight poles; curved and hinged poles are available from numerous companies, allowing installation in bay windows and around curved walls and corners. <b>Curtain</b> <b>rods</b> can also be shaped like a crane or exhibit a swing arm design. Prices and quality of <b>curtain</b> <b>rods</b> are as varied as designs from inexpensive big box store products to high end specialty products made by companies catering to interior designers and architects.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{the initial}} {{installation}} {{would remain in}} operation, the additional antenna spokes and alternator installations would not be completed, due to a major discovery about radio signal propagation. While investigating transmitter [...] "harmonics" [...] – unwanted additional radio signals produced at higher frequencies than a station's normal transmission frequency – Westinghouse's Frank Conrad unexpectedly found {{that in some cases}} the harmonics could be heard farther than the primary signal, something previously thought impossible, as high-frequency shortwave signals, which had poor groundwave coverage, were thought to have a very limited transmission range. In 1924, Conrad demonstrated to Sarnoff that a low-powered shortwave station in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania could be readily received in London by a simple receiver using a <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> as an antenna, matching, at {{a small fraction of the}} cost, the performance of the massive alternator transmitters. In 1926 Dr. Harold H. Beverage further reported that a shortwave signal, transmitted on a 15-meter wavelength (approximately 20MHz), was received in South America more readily during the daytime than the 200 kilowatt alternator transmissions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an effort}} {{to shake off the}} gloom of Joe's death, Jimmy invites {{everyone}} to have a drink on him. The men sing [...] "Life in Mahagonny", describing how one could live in the city for only five dollars a day, but those who wanted to have fun always needed more. Jim, increasingly drunk, dreams of sailing back to Alaska. He takes down a <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> for a mast and climbs on the pool table, pretending it is a ship; Jenny and Billy play along. Jimmy is abruptly sobered up when Begbick demands payment for the whiskey {{as well as for the}} damage to her property. Totally broke, he turns in a panic to Jenny, who explains her refusal to help him out in the song [...] "Make your own bed"– an adaptation of the ideas he proclaimed at the end of act 1. Jim is led off in chains as the chorus, singing another stanza of [...] "Life in Mahagonny", returns to its pastimes. Trinity Moses assures the crowd that Jimmy will pay for his crimes with his life.|$|E
2500|$|The Brandenburg tornado, which {{produced}} F5 damage and took 31 lives, touched down in Breckinridge County at 4:25pm CDT and followed a [...] path. [...] The tornado first {{moved across the}} north edge of Hardinsburg, inflicting F3 damage to homes at that location. The tornado quickly became violent as it moved into Meade County, producing F4 to F5 damage as it passed north of Irvington, sweeping away numerous homes in this rural area. Vehicles were thrown hundreds of yards from residences and mangled, and a few were completely wrapped around trees. One home that was swept away sustained total collapse of a poured concrete walk-out basement wall. A news photographer reported that the tornado [...] "left no grass" [...] as it crossed Kentucky Route 79 in this area, and canceled checks from near Irvington were later found in Ohio. Past Irvington, the tornado tore directly through Brandenburg at F5 intensity, completely leveling and sweeping away numerous homes, {{some of which were}} well-built and anchor-bolted. 18 of the fatalities alone occurred along Green St in Brandenburg, and the town's downtown area was also devastated. Trees and shrubbery in town were debarked and stripped, extensive wind-rowing of debris occurred, and numerous vehicles were destroyed as well, some of which had nothing left but the frame and tires. A <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> was found speared deeply into the trunk of one tree in town. Several tombstones in the Cap Anderson cemetery were toppled and broken, and some were displaced a small distance. Exiting Brandenburg, the tornado crossed into Indiana producing F4 damage there before dissipating. The same storm would later produce tornadoes in the Louisville metro area.|$|E

On November 21 (a Thursday) Oswald asked Frazier for an unusual mid-week lift back to Irving, saying he had to pick up some <b>curtain</b> <b>rods.</b> The next morning (the day of the assassination), he returned to Dallas with Frazier. He left behind $170 and his wedding ring, but took a large paper bag with him. Frazier reported that Oswald told him the bag contained <b>curtain</b> <b>rods,</b> The Warren Commission concluded that the package of [...] "curtain rods" [...] actually contained the rifle that Oswald was going to use for the assassination.|$|R

Ida has a monkey which lives on the <b>curtain</b> <b>rod.</b> It is a most dreadful creature. It will remain absolutely motionless until it sees that you have forgotten its presence, {{and then it will}} suddenly bound from picture to picture all round the walls, and end by swinging down on the bell-rope and jumping on to the top of your head. At breakfast it stole a poached egg and daubed it all over the door handle. Ida calls these outrages amusing tricks." ...|$|E
60|$|Chaotic indiscipline, ill-adjusted effort, spasmodic aims, these {{give the}} quality of all my Bromstead memories. The {{crowning}} one of them all rises to desolating tragedy. I remember now the wan spring sunshine of that Sunday morning, the stiff feeling of best clothes and aggressive cleanliness and formality, when I and my mother returned from church to find my father dead. He had been pruning the grape vine. He {{had never had a}} ladder long enough to reach the sill of the third-floor windows--at house-painting times he had borrowed one from the plumber who mixed his paint--and he had in his own happy-go-lucky way contrived a combination of the garden fruit ladder with a battered kitchen table that served all sorts of odd purposes in an outhouse. He had stayed up this arrangement by means of the garden roller, and the roller had at the critical moment--rolled. He was lying close by the garden door with his head queerly bent back against a broken and twisted rainwater pipe, an expression of pacific contentment on his face, a bamboo <b>curtain</b> <b>rod</b> with a tableknife tied to end of it, still gripped in his hand. We had been rapping for some time at the front door unable to make him hear, and then we came round by the door in the side trellis into the garden and so discovered him.|$|E
6000|$|Your most kind gratulatory note {{deserved}} {{an answer}} more gratefully prompt than this. But I extended my absence {{from town to}} a short visit at Cheltenham, {{and the whole thing}} was virtually, till yesterday, a complete extinction of leisure. Delightful of you to want [...] "details." [...] I think, if I were to inflict them on you, they would all be illustrative of the cheering and rewarding side of our feverish profession. The passage from knock-kneed nervousness (the night of the première, as one clings, in the wing, to the <b>curtain</b> <b>rod,</b> as to the pied des autels) to a simmering serenity is especially life-saving in its effect. I flung myself upon Compton after the 1st act: [...] "In heaven's name, is it going?" [...] "Going?--Rather! You could hear a pin drop!" [...] Then, after that, one felt it--one heard it--one blessed it--and, at the end of all, one (after a decent and discreet delay) simpered and gave oneself up to courbettes before the curtain, while the applausive house emitted agreeable sounds from a kind of gas-flaring indistinguishable dimness and the gratified Compton publicly pressed one's hand and one felt that, really, as far as Southport could testify to the circumstance, the stake was won. Of course it's only Southport--but I have larger hopes, inasmuch as it was just the meagre provincial conditions and the limited provincial interpretation that deprived the performance of all adventitious aid. And when my hero and heroine and another friend supped with me at the inn after the battle, I felt that they were really as radiant as if we were carousing among the slain. They seem indeed wondrous content. The great feature of the evening was the way Compton [...] "came out" [...] beyond what he had done or promised at rehearsal, and acted really most interestingly and admirably--if not a [...] "revelation" [...] at any rate a very jolly surprise. His part is one in which I surmise he really counts upon making a large success--and though I say it who shouldn't, it is one of incontestable opportunities. However, all this is to come--and we stumble in judgment. Amen. Voilà, ma chère amie. You have been through all this, and more, and will tolerate my ingenuities....|$|E

There was a window, too, through which he caught sight of lawns and statues and formal trees.
