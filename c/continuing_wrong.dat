50|$|One {{proposed}} {{cause of}} such length changes is replication slippage, caused by mismatches between DNA strands while being replicated during meiosis. DNA polymerase, the enzyme responsible for reading DNA during replication, can slip while moving along the template strand and <b>continue</b> at the <b>wrong</b> nucleotide. DNA polymerase slippage {{is more likely}} to occur when a repetitive sequence (such as CGCGCG) is replicated. Because microsatellites consist of such repetitive sequences, DNA polymerase may make errors at a higher rate in these sequence regions. Several studies have found evidence that slippage is the cause of microsatellite mutations. Typically, slippage in each microsatellite occurs about once per 1,000 generations. Thus, slippage changes in repetitive DNA are three orders of magnitude more common than point mutations {{in other parts of the}} genome. Most slippage results in a change of just one repeat unit, and slippage rates vary for different allele lengths and repeat unit sizes, and within different species. If there is a large size difference between individual alleles, then there may be increased instability during recombination at meiosis.|$|R

For the most part, however, {{our understanding of}} love and its relevance for revolution remains vague. My article seeks to remedy this limitation. It starts by sketching the social and personal contexts of alienation, indicating that in today’s capitalist world genuine love is revolutionary in itself. It then specifies what love means, what types of love exist, and what revolutionary love implies in theory and practice. The next section introduces the political cultures of loving revolution concept and applies it to the Indian independence movement led by Gandhi. The conclusion discusses how potential revolutionaries might benefit from my interpretation of love and revolution. Keywords agape, alienation, love, political cultures of loving revolution, revolution One must have a large dose of humanity, a large dose {{of a sense of}} justice and truth, to avoid falling into extremes, into cold intellectualism, into isolation from the masses. Every day we must struggle so that this love of living humanity is transformed into concrete facts, into acts that will serve as an example.

5000|$|The {{order of}} listed yamas, {{the names and}} nature of each yamas, {{as well as the}} {{relative}} emphasis vary between the texts. Some texts use the reverse of Niyamas in other texts, as Yamas; for example, Vairagya (dispassion from hedonism, somewhat reverse of the niyama Tapas) is described in verse 33 of Trishikhi Brahmana Upanishad in its list for Yamas. Many texts substitute one or more different concepts in their list of Yamas. For example, in the ten Yamas listed by Yatidharma Sangraha, Akrodha (non-anger) is included as a Yamas. Ahirbudhnya Samhita in verse 31.19 and Darshana Upanishad in verses 1.14-15 include Dayā as a Yamas, and explain it as the ethical restraint of not jumping to conclusions, being compassionate to every being and considering suffering of others as one's own. In verse 31.21, Ahirbudhnya Samhita includes Kșhamā as the virtue of forgiveness and restraint from <b>continued</b> agitation from <b>wrong</b> others have done. Mahakala Samhita in verses II.11.723 through II.11.738 lists many of the 10 Yamas above, but explains why it is a virtue in a different way. For example, the text explains Dayā (or Dayaa) is an ethical precept and the restraint from too much and too little emotions. It suggests Dayā reflects one's inner state, is the expression of kindness towards kin, friend, stranger and even a hostile person, and that one must remain good and kind no matter what the circumstances. This view for the Yamas of Dayā is shared in Shandilya Upanishad and Jabala Darshana Upanishad. Atri Samhita in verse 48, lists Anrshamsya (आनृशंस्य) as the restraint from cruelty to any living being by one's actions, words or in thoughts. Shivayoga Dipika in verse 2.9 substitutes Sunrta for Satya, defining Sunrta as [...] "sweet and true speech".|$|R

[...] "I'd have taken a corps de ballet contract, anything, but there wasn't one," [...] she told Jann Parry, who {{was at that time}} the Observer's dance critic. Later that year, though, a principal contract came up and Rojo was recommended. Then later that year Rojo was asked to replace an injured Darcey Bussell in Giselle. Ignoring her own sprained ankle and the short notice, she learned the role in two weeks and went on to receive rave reviews In 2002, while dancing as Clara in the Nutcracker, Rojo started shaking on stage. After the show, she was sent to a private hospital where they determined that her appendix had burst and she stayed there to heal for 6 weeks. However, two weeks later she was back dancing and she was forced to go to a hospital again. Rojo admitted that it was “completely <b>wrong</b> <b>continue</b> dancing while injured or ill and I do not feel that anyone should do this. It really is not worth it.” [...] In 2003, while preparing for the Royal Ballet’s Australian tour, Rojo was once again plagued with another setback when she suffered an infected bunion that became so bad that her foot swelled {{to the size of a}} tennis ball. Doctors determined that Rojo needed to have it drained and to have surgery on her foot - a potentially career-ending operation. Nevertheless, she knew that this operation was a necessary step to take if she were ever to walk, let alone dance, again. A mere twenty-four hours after her operation, an Ambassador from Spain called to inform her that she had been honoured with an award and needed to be in Cadiz the next week. The King of Spain presented her with the Royal Gold Medal of Fine Arts, a prestigious honour that few can say they have achieved. Months later, and after countless hours of rehabilitation, she returned to dancing and said that the injury changed her perspective on life, her body, and dance. She felt that she valued each and every day more and learned that nothing in life should be taken for granted.|$|R

However, children seem to be particularly affected by domestic violence, either physically, emotionally or socially. In order to adequately address these diverse experiences and understand what children say, an in-depth investigation into how children experience domestic violence, and what their views are, is required. The study will focus on those children who had been affected emotionally and socially in their homes. This study will make an attempt to expand on how children experience domestic violence, what the general reaction of a selected group of children, who have observed domestic violence, is and what their views of domestic violence are. Attention was given to the relevant literature as well to legislative and policy frameworks. The study employed a qualitative research method in order to obtain in-depth data from the children. Children were selected from three schools in a small Northern Cape town, which participated in the study and the schools were grouped as follows: one school from each area, which are Nonzwakazi, Sunrise and De Aar (town). Each high school had five participants. The participants‟ ages were between 12 and 17. All the participants reside at De Aar which is situated in Prixley kaSeme District about 300 kilometres from Kimberley, Northern Cape Province. Data was coded according to the themes that emerged from the study and were analysed. The results indicated that children are able to share their experiences when given the opportunity. It is further shown in the results that children view domestic violence as a wrong and that men are the sole abusers. It further indicated that children do not have confidence in the courts; they are of the view that the courts are being too lenient on the abusers and they further said that more protection orders should be issued in order to prevent domestic violence. They blame this on non-responsiveness of the police when they are called and the kind of punishments the courts impose when the abuser is brought before court. The majority of children expressed their wish to see justice being done. The study found that children are of the view that there is little support from the police and the courts. The study concluded that children, acting voluntarily and with appropriate ethical safeguards, can make a significant contribution to both describing their experiences of domestic violence, and to indicating the standard of services and other interventions that they can trust and use...|$|R
