The shell is {{elevated}} and longitudinally unequally striate. The spire is gradate. The whorls are subbicarinate, smooth and flat. The aperture is subquadrangular. The open umbilicus has a smooth texture.|$|E
50|$|C. luhuanus {{is often}} {{mistaken for a}} Cone snail, {{mainly because of the}} <b>conoidal</b> outline of its shell, which is {{relatively}} unusual among the Strombidae. Its stromboid notch, though not as conspicuous as observed in many species that used to belong to Strombus (such as Lentigo lentiginosus), is deep and easily distinguished. The interior may be slightly lirate.|$|E

50|$|Shell {{depressed}} <b>conoidal,</b> oval-oblong, {{the sides}} straightened, subparallel, thin, semitransparent, horn-colour, with a blackish-green coating. Apex a little inclined to the right, {{situated at the}} posterior sixth of the length, flatly convex anteriorly; concentric lines of growth at regular intervals. Interior light brown, shining. Aperture is elongated oval, slightly broadened anteriorly. Specimens have been found with the septum partly formed, but not adult.|$|E
50|$|The imperforate, heavy, solid, thick shell has a <b>conoidal</b> {{shape and}} is elevated. Its colors shows {{alternating}} whitish and purplish-grey or blackish crowded, slanting axial stripes, speckled with whitish. The stripes occupy the interstices between close, narrow superficial {{folds of the}} surface, which may be well-marked, or obsolete, continuous or cut into granules by equally close spiral furrows, the latter sometimes predominating.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{an adult}} shell varies between 12 mm and 24 mm. The lusterless <b>conoidal</b> shell is {{narrowly}} umbilicate, more or less depressed, strong and solid. Its color is whitish or yellowish, with radiating maculations or stripes above; the base unicolored or obliquely striped with the stripes often interrupted. The <b>conoidal</b> spire has an acute, corneous apex. The sutures are impressed. There are about six convex whorls, the last one rounded at the periphery but often with {{a tendency to be}} biangulate there. The sculpture is densely finely lirate all over. The lirae are very closely and finely beaded by the oblique incremental striae which are prominent in the interliral spaces. The oblique aperture is rounded-quadrate and conspicuously lirate within. The ten lirae extend nearly {{to the edge of the}} outer lip. The columella is short, ending below in a denticle, concave above and reflected partly over the umbilicus, and over the termination of a strong spiral funicle, which almost fills the white umbilicus.|$|E
50|$|The {{height of}} the shell attains 26 mm, its {{diameter}} 27 mm. Some are larger with a height of 50 mm. The solid, heavy shell is narrowly umbilicate and has a <b>conoidal</b> shape. It is dull cinereous, more or less variegated by brown, blackish or red streaks. The spire is <b>conoidal,</b> generally eroded and white or yellow at the apex. The about 5 whorls are obliquely striate, radiately coarsely and irregularly plicate and rugose above, sometimes nearly smooth. The periphery is rounded. The base of the shell is convex and concentrically lirate. The aperture is oblique. The columella is strongly dentate in the middle or below it, with a second small tooth at the base. The edge of the columella is rather deeply curved above the tooth, but spreading at its junction with the whorl, bounding and somewhat narrowing the umbilicus by a white callus, which does not extend to the upper margin of the aperture. The deep umbilicus is white within.|$|E
50|$|The whitish-pearly, thin {{shell is}} broadly umbilicated. It has a <b>conoidal</b> shape. The 5½ convex whorls are {{separated}} by a gradate suture. They are ornamented with oblique, dense regular radiating costellae, and two spiral lirae on the lower part. The body whorl is ventricose, radiately costellate above, with three acute elevated median spiral cinguli, beneath with obsolete concentric striae. The umbilicus is wide, carinated at the periphery, plicate, and denticulate. The aperture is subcircular.|$|E
50|$|Military {{doctrine}} {{has played}} a significant influence on the core engineering design considerations of artillery ordnance through its history, in seeking to achieve a balance between delivered volume of fire with ordnance mobility. However, during the modern period, the consideration of protecting the gunners also arose due to the late-19th-century introduction of {{the new generation of}} infantry weapons using <b>conoidal</b> bullet, better known as the Minié ball, with a range almost as long as that of field artillery.|$|E
50|$|Pairs of gamonts {{associate}} as two hemispherical gametocytes {{with the}} <b>conoidal</b> complexes of each juxtaposed. The complexes then disappear. The host tissue has usually been lysed {{by the time}} of gametocyte formation so that the cells are extracellular among host cell debris in spaces within the lysed tissue. Several nuclear divisions involving meiosis, occur to form 4 isogametes within a gametocyst wall. This followed by pairing and copulation. Residual or somatic nuclei in 1 or 2 residual bodies later degenerate.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 10 mm and 30 mm.The thin shell is <b>conoidal,</b> subdiaphanous and imperforate. Its color is, tawny golden-shining. The whorls are a little convex. They are {{sculptured}} with spiral beaded cinguli. Their interstices are obliquely striate. The sutures are canaliculate. The base of the shell is convex, with granose cinguli, some granules marked with brown. The aperture is suborbicular. The columella is spiral above, produced into a tooth below. The margin of the lip is acute and lirate inside.|$|E
50|$|The {{height of}} the shell attains 5 mm, its {{diameter}} 5 mm. The umbilicated, very fragile shell has a <b>conoidal</b> shape. The 5½ whorls are angular and flat above. The first 3 whorls are smooth, the remainder minutely cingulate, granose, and obliquely striate. They are ornamented with chestnut-brown radiating spots and whitish. The body whorl is angular at its base, convex below, and ornamented with 7 minutely grained concentric lirae. The ample umbilicus is scalariform, cingulate, granose, and bounded by a white crenate riblet.|$|E
5000|$|The size of {{the shell}} varies between 13 mm and 25 mm. The very strong and solid shell has a {{depressed}} <b>conoidal</b> shape with a rounded periphery and a profoundly umbilicate axis. It is, densely granulate. The overall coloration of the whorls and the spire is dark strawberry red or coral red. The spire is <b>conoidal</b> with scarcely convex outlines. The about 6 whorls are somewhat convex and separated by well impressed sutures. The body whorl is large and deflected anteriorly. It bears 18 or 19 crowded, closely granose cinguli, of which the 1st, 3d, 5th, 7th, 9th and two upon the base are composed of alternate black and white granules. Upon the baseof the shell the granulation is finer. The base is convex, a trifle indented toward the center. The oblique aperture is subtetragonal. The peristome has a marginal row {{of black and white}} dots. The outer lip is plicate within, with a short plicifbrm tubercle above. The basal lip,the outer margin of the umbilicus and the parietal wall are provided with wrinkle-like plicae. The columella is very oblique, terminating below in a square prominence, contorted above, and inserted {{on the side of the}} umbilicus. The umbilicus is white, and smooth within the strongly radiately plicate marginal rib, smooth.|$|E
50|$|The shell {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 14.1 mm. The thin, {{imperforate}} shell has a depressed-conoidal shape. It is shining, of a light olivaceous tint or somewhat tinged with pink. Its surface is smooth. The acute spire is <b>conoidal.</b> The sutures are slightly impressed. The shell contains about 42 rapidly widening whorls. The large body whorl is rounded at the periphery and a little impressed or margined below the suture. The large aperture is rounded and angular above, green and iridescent inside. The columellar margin is a little straightened. The umbilico-columellar tract is slightly excavated.|$|E
50|$|The low spire has a <b>conoidal</b> shape. The sutures are linearand not impressed. The body whorl is concave above. The {{compressed}} periphery is {{encircled by}} two rather obscure carinae. The {{base of the}} shell is slightly convex, with a narrow spiral groove bounding a central areawhich is covered by a thin, radiately rugose, purple and white callus. The aperture is rounded quadrate, nacreous and iridescent within. The columella is short, very thick and heavy. Its edge is pearly, inserted in a pad of white callus on the body and over the axis.|$|E
