Its potential, however, has not been fully explored in complex forested ecosystems, especially in riparian forests, considered among the most dynamic and complex portions of the Earth's biosphere. In this study, forest inventory data and multiple ground scans were obtained in a sparse managed and dense natural riparian forest on the immediate banks of the mid-lower portion of the Garonne River in Southern France, dominated by black poplar (Populus nigra) and commercial hybrid poplars (Populus Ã— euramericana). Overall, the ground-based laser-scanning analysis successfully estimated trunk diameters, tree heights and <b>crown</b> <b>radii</b> from both managed and natural riparian forests. However, the ground scanner analysis was not as successful in identifying all of the trunks in the dense natural riparian forest, with only 141 trunks identified from a total of 234. This also results in allometric scaling exponents for ground scanning, which are significantly different from field-derived exponents. This study thus shows {{that there may be a}} limit to the number of trees detected in higher density forests, even with multiple scans...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Regression {{models to}} predict {{diameter}} at breast height (DBH) {{as a function}} of tree height and maximum <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> were developed for Caribbean forests based on data collected by the U. S. Forest Service in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Territory of the U. S. Virgin Islands. The model predicting DBH from tree height fit reasonably well (R 2 = 0. 7110), with strongest in subtropical moist and wet forest. The model predicting DBH from <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> fit the data poorly (R 2 = 0. 2876), but improvements were made when the model was fit by forest life zone and <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> measurement protocol. Models fit with both maximum <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> and tree height had R-square values that ranged from 0. 1803 for the subtropical dry forest to 0. 8018 for the subtropical moist forest life zone where <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> was measured with urban forest inventory protocols. Tree heights had stronger correlations with DBH than did <b>crown</b> <b>radius,</b> perhaps due to difficulties in measuring tree crown width or natural variability in this hurricane-disturbed environment. Models that use tree height have some potential for predicting DBH for use in Caribbean forest biomass and carbon estimation models, but the potential for error propagation by using DBH predicted from <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> is too great to earn our recommendation for such applications...|$|E

The Kolmogorov-Smirnof (KS) D statistic (Conover 1999) was used to select the best-matching distribution (corresponding to a smoothing level).

40|$|Crown {{structure}} {{is a key}} variable influencing stand productivity, but its reported response to various stand factors has varied. This can be partially attributed to lack of a unified study on crown response to intensive management or stand health. In this analysis of several coastal Douglas-lir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii [Mirb. ] Franco) branch datasets, a significant treatment effect of fertilization, thinning, prc-commercial thinning, varying levels of vegetation control, and intensity of a foliar disease (Swiss needle cast, caused by Phaeocryptopus gaeunlannii (T. Rohde) Petr.) were all found to influence several key crown structural attributes. Maximum branch size and total and non-foliated <b>crown</b> <b>radii</b> {{were found to be}} the most dynamic and sensitive crown variables to the various stand factors as no treatment effects were found for the number of branches within an annual segment or branch angle. When the data sets were combined andused to develop a single predictive equation, treatment effects were largely accounted for by changes in bole and crown size as mean bias was relatively low despite the large range in tree ages examined (4 - 450 years at breast height). While crown {{structure is}} highly variable and sensitive to a variety of stand factors, general empirical equations perform quite well and should be better integrated into models of forest growth and yield...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Currently, foliage biomass is {{estimated}} based on stem diameter or basal area. However, it is questionable whether {{the relations between}} foliage and stem observed from plantations of a single tree species {{can be applied to}} stands of different structure or species composition. In this paper, a procedure is presented to simulate foliage and branch biomass of tree crowns relative to crown size and light competition. Crowns are divided into layers and segments and each segment is divided into a foliated and an unfoliated fraction. Depending on the competitive status of the segment, leaf area density, specific leaf area and foliated branch fraction are determined. Based on this information, foliage biomass is calculated. The procedure requires a crown shape function and a measure to characterise competition for light and space of each individual segment within the canopy. Simple solutions are suggested for both requirements to enable an application with data that can be measured non-destruc-tively in the field; these were stem position, tree height, crown base height, <b>crown</b> <b>radii</b> and some general crown shape information. The model was parameterised from single trees of Norway spruce and European beech and partly evaluated with independent data close to the investigation plot. Evaluations showed that the model can attribute the ecology of the different crown forms. Modelled foliage distribution for beech and spruce as well as total needle biomass of spruce agreed well with measurements but foliage biomass of beech was under-estimated. The results are discussed {{in the context of a}} general model application in structured forests...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{canopy density}} and height {{are used as}} {{variables}} {{in a number of}} environmental applications, including the estimation of biomass, forest extent and condition, and biodiversity. The airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is very useful to estimate forest canopy parameters according to the generated canopy height models (CHMs). The purpose of this work is to introduce an algorithm to delineate crown parameters, e. g. tree height and <b>crown</b> <b>radii</b> based on the generated rasterized CHMs. And accuracy assessment for the extraction of volumetric parameters of a single tree is also performed via manual measurement using corresponding aerial photo pairs. A LiDAR dataset of a golf course acquired by Leica ALS 70 -HP is used in this study. Two algorithms, i. e. a traditional one with the subtraction of a digital elevation model (DEM) from a digital surface model (DSM), and a pit-free approach are conducted to generate the CHMs firstly. Then two algorithms, a multilevel morphological active-contour (MMAC) and a variable window filter (VWF), are implemented and used in this study for individual tree delineation. Finally, experimental results of two automatic estimation methods for individual trees can be evaluated with manually measured stand-level parameters, i. e. tree height and crown diameter. The resulting CHM generated by a simple subtraction is full of empty pixels (called "pits") that will give vital impact on subsequent analysis for individual tree delineation. The experimental results indicated that if more individual trees can be extracted, tree crown shape will became more completely in the CHM data after the pit-free process...|$|R
40|$|Crown {{profile is}} mostly {{related to the}} {{competition}} of individual trees in the stands, light interception, growth, and yield of trees. A total of 76 sample trees with a total number of 889 whorls and 3658 live branches were used to develop the outer crown profile model of the planted Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica trees in Heilongjiang Province, China. The power-exponential equation, modified Kozak equation, and simple polynomial equation were used and the model which showed the best performance {{was used as the}} basic model. The dummy variable approach was used to analyze the effect of stand age and stand density on the crown profile. Quantile regression for linear mixed-effects model, where the correlations between the series measurements on the same subject were considered, was used to model the outer crown profile. The results indicated that the power-exponential equation had the smallest error and was used as the basic model. Based on the dummy variable approach, stand age and stand density showed significant effects on the crown profile on the whole. Thus, they were directly included into the linear form of the power-exponential equation by a natural logarithm transformation to develop the quantile regression for the linear mixed-effects model. The 0. 95 th quantile regression model performed best in modeling the outer crown profile when compared to other quantiles. The prediction accuracy of the 0. 95 th quantile regression model by adding the random effects increased when compared to the quantile regression without random effect. The quantile regression for the linear mixed-effects model also showed an excellent performance in the largest <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> prediction when compared to the quantile regression model. From suppressed trees to dominant trees, the <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> increased, with tree size increasing for the same stand age and stand density increases. The <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> of the suppressed trees from 21 to 40 year stands was the largest and the smallest was from older (> 40 years) stands. The <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> for both the intermediate and dominant trees from 21 to 40 year stands were similar and were larger than the younger (10 â€“ 20 years) stands. The <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> increased with tree size when the stand variables were constant. Furthermore, the <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> increased with the increase of stand age, decreased with increasing stand density, and decreased with increased ratio of tree height to diameter at the breast height (HD) for trees with the same tree variables. Stand density had a weaker effect on the crown profile when compared to the HD.

Estimating DBH from mean <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> (MCR) is of interest to natural resource managers because MCR can be estimated from high resolution digital imagery using remote sensing techniques.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a 3 D model-based tree interpreter, a semi-automatic method for tree measurement from highresolution aerial images. It emphasizes {{the extraction of}} the 3 D geometric information such as tree location, tree height, crown depth (or crown height), <b>crown</b> <b>radius,</b> and surface curvature. First, trees are modeled as 30 hemi-ellipsoids with the following parameters: tree-top coordinates, trunk base height, crown depth, <b>crown</b> <b>radius,</b> and crown surface curvature. This model-based approach turns a tree interpretation task into a problem of optimal tree model determination. Multi-angular images are {{used to determine the}} optimal tree model for each tree. Tree tops in each image of a stereo pair are identified interactively with the epipolar constraint, and the 30 geometry of trees can be determined automatically. With such a semi-automatic scheme, efficiency and reliability of 3 ~ tree measurements are achieved by taking advantages of both the operator's interpretation skills and the machine's computation. This paper mainly deals with conifers. The method was tested with a closed conifer stand on 2 : 2, 400 -scale photographs.

40|$|Competition for canopy {{space is}} a process of major {{importance}} in forest dynamics. Although virgin and old-growth European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests in Europe have been studied for many years, there are to date no studies of individual-tree crown plasticity and the way this is influenced by local neighborhood interactions in these forests. In this study, we analyzed crown plasticity and local neighborhood interactions of individual trees in the upper canopy of the old-growth beech forests of Serrahn, northeast Germany. In a 2. 8 -ha sample plot, we measured <b>crown</b> <b>radii</b> of all upper canopy trees and analyzed the direction and extent of crown asymmetry. Size, relative position, and distance of neighboring trees were used to construct vectors of neighborhood asymmetry within different distances from target trees. The crowns of beech trees showed strong morphological plasticity. Mean absolute and relative displacement of crown centers from the stem base were 1. 95 m and 0. 37, respectively. Circularâ€“circular rank correlation coefficients between the direction of crown displacement and the direction of neighborhood pressure showed that trees strongly positioned their crowns away from local neighbors. Highest correlation coefficients were obtained when basal area and relative position of neighboring trees within a radial distance of 12 m were considered. Clark and Evans index and Ripleyâ€™s K-function showed that crowns were more regularly distributed than stems. Projected canopy cover was about 10 % higher than canopy cover with simulated circular crowns. We conclude that the crowns of older beech trees have a high ability to plastically respond to changes in the local canopy conditions, enabling very effective exploitation of canopy space...|$|R

The soil-understory background contribution was partly isolated prior to inversion using regression relationships with the isotropic, geometric, and volume scattering kernel weights of a Li-Ross kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model. The height retrievals were assessed using discrete return lidar data acquired over sites in Colorado {{as part of the}} Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) and used with fractional crown cover retrievals to obtain aboveground woody biomass estimates. For all model runs with reasonable backgrounds and initial b/r (vertical to horizontal <b>crown</b> <b>radii)</b> values 3 Ì†c 2. 0, root mean square error (RMSE) distributions were centered between 2. 5 and 3. 7 m while R 2 distributions were centered between 0. 4 and 0. 7. The MISR/ GO aboveground biomass estimates predicted via regression on fractional cover and mean canopy height for the CLPX sites showed good agreement with U. S. Forest Service Interior West map data (adjusted R 2 = 0. 84). The implication is that multiangle sensors such as MISR can provide spatially contiguous retrievals of forest canopy height, cover, and aboveground woody biomass that are potentially useful in mapping distributions of aboveground carbon stocks, tracking disturbance, and in initializing, constraining, and validating ecosystem models. This is important because the MISR record is spatially comprehensive and extends back to the year 2000 and the launch of the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite; it might thus provide a 10 -year baseline record that would enhance exploitation of data from the NASA Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynI) mission, as well as furthering realization of synergies with active instruments...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Forest {{canopy cover}} {{presents}} {{a major challenge}} for remote sensing of fractional snow-covered area (Æ’SCA). Snow cover is systematically underestimated where satellites sensors cannot penetrate the forest canopy. Current canopy adjustments scale observable Æ’SCA with the vegetation fraction, assuming that snow cover distributions are similar between sub-canopy and open locations. This assumption may be invalid because snow accumulation and ablation processes depend on forest characteristics. This study addresses how individual trees and the forest canopy affect snow cover distributions {{with the goal of}} determining metrics that can characterize spatial patterns of sub-canopy snow cover. In situ snow cover and forest canopy measurements were made at several snow study sites in the Oregon Cascades. These were compared to canopy-adjusted satellite estimates of Æ’SCA. Differences between in situ and satellite Æ’SCA were assessed based on forest canopy structure derived from manual surveys along transects, and 3 -D terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). For larger spatial context, a simple geometric-optical model (SGM) was used to estimate forest canopy parameters from aerial photographs and multi-angular satellite data. The canopy adjustment resulted in improvements over unadjusted Æ’SCA. However, a single canopy adjustment function is not able to adequately adjust for snow under trees in all cases. At the lower elevation sites, snow was present in the low-density forest sites for at least 14 days after it had completely disappeared from the high-density forested sites. At the higher elevation sites, snow remained in the high-density forested sites for at least 7 days after it had completely disappeared from the low-density sites. In assessing the vegetation survey results we found that TLS effectively depicted tree heights and <b>crown</b> <b>radii,</b> but the SGM estimates of canopy structure from aerial photographs and satellite multi-angular reflectance data require further refinement in dense forests before being applied for operational canopy adjustments...|$|R

Typical forest inventory variables (DBH, height, height-to-crown base, crown class, basal area per hectare, and trees per hectare) were considered {{as independent variables}} in model development. Models were fitted using both ordinary and weighted least squares methods. It was found that for the species studied, an ordinary {{least squares linear regression}} with DBH as the only independent variable was appropriate. For some species studied, the addition of other independent variables provided minor improvements over the model with only DBH. These models of <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> could be summed to give an estimation of canopy cover. Using crown mapped data, it was possible to test and calibrate these models to predict non-overlapping canopy cover. Linear and non-linear models were considered for calibration.

Increment cores of the trees were used for identifying the relationship of basal area and basal area increment and for extrapolating the temporal dynamics for each species in relation to the allometric parameters and growth extensions.

The results show that, among the investigated species, Quercus nigra and Khaya senegalensis have the highest growth rates for stem diameter and <b>crown</b> <b>radius,</b> whereas Tilia cordata and Aesculus hippocastanum remain on a lower level. A significant reduction of tree growth due to restricted non-paved area was found for Aesculus hippocastanum and Khaya senegalensis.

Improved estimates were achieved in many cases when D 50 (diameter at 0. 5 m) was used instead of DBH.

A multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) axisymmetric multiphase lattice-Boltzmann (LB) model is employed {{along with a}} model for simulating surface wettability. For simulations on wet walls, a recently developed high density-ratio LB model is employed. This model is extended in this work to include the MRT collision model and thereby achieve Reynolds number which are 50 % higher, and adapted to an axisymmetric coordinate system. The model is evaluated by verifying the Laplace-Young relation for a liquid drop and comparing the computed frequency of oscillations of an initially ellipsoidal drop with analytical values. Agreement within 8 % is obtained. ^ When the impingement is on dry walls, the outcomes are deposition, rebound and splash. In deposition, the dynamic contact angle evolution during spread and recoil was shown {{to be influenced by}} the drop inertia and transient effects of the varying contact line speed. The tendency to rebound increases with increase in static advancing and receding contact angles, and the shape of the drop at the time of rebound becomes elongated as Weber number (We) and equilibrium contact angle increase. The transition to splash depends on We and Oh. Splash at low We and high Oh leads to formation of a liquid crown before it breaks up into smaller droplets. ^ When the impingement is on wet walls, the growth of the liquid crown and its breakup are influenced by the wall liquid film thickness and the ambient gas density and viscosity. When the wall-film thickness is small, the growth rates of the <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> and height increase with increasing thickness and breakup time is increased. On thicker films, however, the growth rates have the opposite trend. The crown breakup time is further increased. When the gas density increases, the growth rates of <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> and height decrease, and crown breakup occurs at a longer time. Increasing the gas viscosity has a weak influence on the growth rate of <b>crown</b> <b>radius.</b> However, at higher gas viscosity the crown height grows faster and breaks up earlier. ...|$|E

40|$|Assessment of the {{susceptibility}} {{of forests}} to mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) infestation {{is based upon}} {{an understanding of the}} characteristics that predispose the stands to attack. These assessments are typically derived from conventional forest inventory data; however, this information often represents only managed forest areas. It does not cover areas such as forest parks or conservation regions and is often not regularly updated resulting in an inability to assess forest susceptibility. To address these shortcomings, we demonstrate how a geometric optical model (GOM) can be applied to Landsat- 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery (30 m spatial resolution) to estimate stand-level susceptibility to mountain pine beetle attack. Spectral mixture analysis was used to determine the proportion of sunlit canopy and background, and shadow of each Landsat pixel enabling per pixel estimates of attributes required for model inversion. Stand structural attributes were then derived from inversion of the geometric optical model and used as basis for susceptibility mapping. Mean stand density estimated by the geometric optical model was 2753 (standard deviation Â± 308) stems per hectare and mean horizontal <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> was 2. 09 (standard deviation Â± 0. 11) metres. When compared to equivalent forest inventory attributes, model predictions of stems per hectare and <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> were shown to be reasonably estimated using a Kruskalâ€“Wallis ANOVA (p < 0. 001).

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} in Umfakarin natural forest reserve, South Kordofan, Sudan. The main objective was to investigate the possibility of managing Acacia seyal Del. variety seyal for the production of gum talha. Three stand densities (strata), namely dense, medium, and slight, were distinguished {{based on the number of}} trees per hectare. During the sampling phase, the study adopted the method of identifying the competitors (neighboring trees) from the subject one (trees selected for gum production experiments). From the three stand densities, a total of 482 subject trees, covering variable diameter ranges (d= 9 - 11. 5, 13. 5 - 16, 18 - 20. 5 and above 21 cm) were selected, based on the diameter at 0. 25 m height (d 0. 25). In each stratum, competitor trees were identified within a radius equal to the height of subject tree multiplied by a factor (1. 25). The diameter at breast height, height to crown base, height, <b>crown</b> <b>radii,</b> and tree coordinates were measured for each of the subject trees and its competitors. Subject trees were exposed to tapping on first of October, the fifteenth of October, and the first of November, using local tools (Sonki and Makmak). Additionally, untapped trees were used as controlling-variables. The initial gum collection was completed fifteen days after the tapping, while the subsequent (7 - 9 pickings) were done at an interval of fifteen days. Six stand height functions were tested and the results illustrated that the Michailow stand height function was suitable for predicting the height of Acacia seyal in Umfakarin natural forest. The predictive ability of this height function ranged from 19. 3 % to 24 %. The volume function used in this study was able to predict the volume of standing trees with more than 92 percent accuracy. Competition among trees of Acacia seyal was assessed in terms of competition indices. Eight competition indices were quantified using the CroCom program. The relationship between these indices and tree dimensions (diameter at breast height, height and crown diameter) was tested using logarithmic models. Among these indices, the Hegyi_ 2 index is considered a suitable index to be applied for estimating the degree of competition in natural stands of A. seyal of dense stratum when using diameter at breast height as a predictor. About 70 % of the total variability is explained by this logarithmic model. Gum yielded by each subject tree per season was obtained by summing up the gum samples collected from all pickings. Gum production per unit area was also determined. Regression tree, general linear model (GLM) and logistic regression techniques were used for analyzing the obtained data. The results of the study indicated that the gum yield is independent of stand density. Tapping has influence on gum yield. Trees tapped by sonki on the first of October at medium stand density have the highest gum with an average value of about 56 g/tree/season. Significant difference (p = 0. 021) was detected between two groups of dates; the first of October and first of November in medium stand density. The results also revealed that the most important variable influencing gum production was found to be diameter at breast height with 23. 95 cm threshold. Between 41 - 53 percent of subject trees produce gum less than 50 g/season. The results indicated that A. seyal species produces a very low quantity of gum talha (3. 6 - 4. 8 kg/ha) and for economic reasons, its tapping is not recommended. The findings of the regression analysis revealed to a model which could be used to estimate the yield of gum talha from A. seyal natural stands in the Umfakarin forest, South Kordofan, Sudan. Conducting experiments on the production of gum talha in permanent plot trials in different climatic regions of the Sudan is highly recommended...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} made of the behaviour of "very thin" torispherical ends subjected to internal pressure. The seventeen ends tested were full-size production ends made from stainless steel, with thickness to diameter ratios (te/Di) varying from 0. 002 to 0. 001. At each value of te/Di the knuckle radius (ri) and <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> (Ri) were varied to cover the range of ends frequently used. Each end was stain gauged on both inner and outer surfaces and then pressurised until buckling occurred in the knuckle region. The strain gauges were monitored throughout each test thus giving a detailed coverage of the strain distribution. High compressive hoop strains, shown to exist on both surfaces of the knuckle, are responsible for the buckling mode of failure. A shape/thickness survey was performed on each end prior to pressure testing. The effects of thickness reductions and deviations of curvature from the nominal are discussed. Residual strain measurements were made on three ends and were shown to be significantly large in the pressed and spun manufactured ends. A study of the effect of work hardening on the properties of the material from which the ends were made is also presented. It is shown that the proof stress and Vickers hardness number increases rapidly when the material is work hardened. The dependence of the elastic stress indices, limit pressures and first buckling pressures on wall thickness, knuckle radius and <b>crown</b> <b>radius</b> has been examined. The design implications of the study are discussed and a method for predicting the first buckling pressure of production ends given...|$|E
40|$|This study {{addresses}} the retrieval of spatially contiguous canopy cover and height estimates in southwestern USforests via inversion of a geometric-optical (GO) model against surface bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) estimates from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). Model inversion can provide such maps if good {{estimates of the}} background bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) are available. The study area is in the Sierra National Forest in the Sierra Nevada of California. Tree number density, mean <b>crown</b> <b>radius,</b> and fractional cover reference estimates were obtained via analysis of QuickBird 0. 6 m spatial resolution panchromatic imagery usingthe CANopy Analysis with Panchromatic Imagery (CANAPI) algorithm, while RH 50, RH 75 and RH 100 (50, 75, and 100 energy return) height data {{were obtained from the}} NASA Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS), a full waveform light detection and ranging (lidar) instrument. These canopy parameters were used to drive {{a modified version of the}} simple GO model (SGM), accurately reproducing patterns ofMISR 672 nm band surface reflectance (mean RMSE 0. 011, mean R 2 0. 82, N 1048). Cover and height maps were obtained through model inversion against MISR 672 nm reflectance estimates on a 250 m grid. The free parameters were tree number density and mean <b>crown</b> <b>radius.</b> RMSE values with respect to reference data for the cover and height retrievals were 0. 05 and 6. 65 m, respectively, with of 0. 54 and 0. 49.

This paper {{deals with}} the study of {{measuring}} the green-value in the landscaping. The author considers the method of the measurement and computation as follows: G_a=(1 -a) Î£Ï€r^ 2. G_c=cÎ£Ï€r^ 2 (H-h). Remarks: G_a: Area occupied by tree- and shrub crowns. G_c: Cubic volume occupied by tree- and shrub crowns. r_ 1 : Major axis of the tree crown. r_ 2 : Minor axis of the tree <b>crown,</b> r: <b>Radius</b> of <b>crown.</b> 2 r=(r_ 1 +r_ 2) / 2 H: Height of the tree. h: Height from the ground to the lowest branch of the tree, c: Coefficient of the tree form. Coefficient of the tree form indicates the relation between eight tree forms and a circle inscribed about {{each one of the}} forms, a: Ratio of duplication in the area occupied by the trees and shrubs. In practical application of the above formula, it is necessary to measure height of the tree, axis of the tree crown, form of the tree and height from the ground to the lowest branch of the tree for each one of the trees and shrubs. The coefficient of tree forms and the duplication of area occupied by tree- and shrub crowns were determined by an actual survey on the landscaped area of the two city parks in Tokyo. From the above survey, the following results were obtained: 1) An average coefficient of the tree form was 0. 5. 2) Generally in the city parks, trees and shrubs were planted at a ratio of 30 0 uplication. 3) The greenery in the city parks measured were 0. 4 m^ 2 per sq. m. in the flat, and 1 m^ 3 in the cubic volume per sq. m. 4) As per the individual tree crown, the occupied area was about 2 m^ 2 and the occupied cubic volume was about 5 m^ 3 on an average...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{numerical}} simulations of coiling (winding of a steel strip on itself) and uncoiling are developed. Initial residual stress field is {{taken into account}} as well as roughness of contacts and elastic-plastic behavior at finite strains, considering the Tresca yield function and isotropic hardening. The main output is the residual stress field due to plastic deformations during the process. This enables to quantify additional flatness defects. The presented coiling simulation relies on a modeling strategy that consists in dividing each time step into two sub-steps. Each sub-step can be solved semi-analytically and numerical optimizations enable to obtain a general solution. Thus reasonable computation times are reached and parametric studies can be performed {{in order to develop}} coiling strategies considering the process parameters. Comparisons with previous models from the literature are presented. Moreover the comparison with a Finite Element simulation presents the same order of magnitude, however it shows that direct computations using classical FE codes are difficult to perform in terms of computation times and stability if an explicit integration scheme is chosen. Numerical results are also given {{in order to determine the}} effect of some parameters such as roughness, yield stress, applied force, strip <b>crown</b> or mandrel's <b>radius...</b>|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Plants {{respond to}} {{defoliation}} {{in many different}} and complex ways, depending on their growth habit and form {{as well as the}} extent and duration of the defoliation. Tree crowns {{have been shown to be}} quite sensitive to disturbances such as defoliation, however quantitative relationships have rarely been developed, making the true biological meaning of crown condition assessments quite difficult to decipher. The sudden emergence of Swiss needle cast (SNC) in the Oregon Coast Range prompted investigation of the response of Douglas-fir crown structure, crown morphology, and foliage dynamics to extended defoliation. Using data from permanent plots and 82 destructively sampled trees, hypotheses regarding the response of trees to defoliation were tested with linear and nonlinear models. Responses of crowns were investigated at multiple levels including the needle, branch, tree, and stand scales. At the individual-needle level, SNC has resulted in foliage that is smaller in length, width, and projected area; lower in dry mass; and higher in specific leaf area. The disease has influenced the foliage age structure by increasing the proportion in the younger age classes with greater SNC severity. The disease has also resulted in crowns that have a greater proportion of their current and 1 -year-old needles located higher in the crown than Abstract approved Douglas A. Maguire normal, while the 2 -, 3 - and 4 -year-old needles are shifted towards the crown base relative to healthy trees. At the branch-level, the disease has modified growth patterns as well as dry matter production and allocation. The number of secondary lateral branches on a primary branch declined in response to the disease, as did the foliated branch length and diameter for a given position in the crown. The ratio of branch length to branch diameter, however, increased with disease severity, which suggests altered elongation patterns. Branches in the lower portion of the heavily diseased crowns were elongating faster than normal, while elongation of branches in the mid-crown was slower. Elongation of branches in the upper crown was unaffected. The disease significantly reduced branch foliage dry matter and area for a given position in the crown and diameter. Branches, however, allocated more dry matter to higher order branches, but less dry matter to primary branch elongation. At the tree-level, the disease has led to crowns that are shorter than normal, while the largest measured standing width remains unaffected. <b>Crown</b> <b>radii</b> and maximum branch diameter profiles suggested that changes within the crown might be occurring at different levels due to variations in SNC damage within the crown. The number of primary interwhorl branches decreased with greater disease severity. SNC also significantly reduced total foliage and branchwood dry matter. Overall, the vertical distribution of foliage dry matter was less skewed and more uniform with increased disease severity. At the stand-level, SNC has significantly increased crown recession rates, woody litterfall, the specific leaf area of the litter, and growth efficiency. The disease caused a decline in foliage litterfall rates as well as leaf area index. In addition, the seasonal distribution of foliage litterfall was altered, with a greater amount occurring in the summer than normal. Crown condition, as assessed by foliage retention and the crown sparseness index, varied with SNC and other site factors. Within-tree variability of foliage retention was significantly higher than between-tree or between-plot variability. Although assessments of foliage retention were found to be highly variable, the sample size required to attain a sufficiently precise estimate for a given tree and stand are lower than the sample sizes currently being collected. The crown sparseness index was found to be significantly less variable than foliage retention and was primarily influenced by stand factors such as age and stand density. Defoliation caused significant changes at the individual needle, branch, tree, and stand levels, complicating efforts to accurately predict growth responses to defoliation. This detailed analysis of crown and foliage dynamics helps to establish links among current SNC studies. For example, growth losses associated with SNC are due to the reduction of foliage area, but also to changes in the size and vertical distribution of the needles. In addition, crown assessment indices such as foliage retention and crown length to sapwood area ratio represent different aspects of crown condition. Crown attributes are sensitive to the direct and indirect effects of SNC, which have important implications for tree growth and stand management. Important direct effects include the premature loss of foliage, while important indirect effects of SNC include changes in the within-crown light environment. Integrating measures of crown condition into forest models, therefore, represents an important step towards incorporating physiological-mechanisms into models for predicting growth responses to environmental changes such as tree disease and for understanding the complex responses of tree morphology and growth...|$|R
