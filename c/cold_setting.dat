50|$|Casting is a {{manufacturing}} {{process in which}} a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solidified part {{is also known as}} a casting, which is ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process.

Medical management includes topical hypertonic saline, the use of a hairdryer to dehydrate the precorneal tear film, and therapeutic soft contact lenses.

Three-ply experimental LVL from OPT veneers were bonded using two adhesive spread levels, 250 and 500 g m - 2 for single glue line. Laminated veneer lumber from rubberwood was used as control. The dimensional stability properties investigated include dimensional changes associated with changes in relative humidity of 30 to 90 %, hysteresis over a range of 30 to 90 % and durability against biological attack through soil burial. Amongst the three adhesives, OPT LVL manufactured with EPI (VAc) had the highest Fibre Saturation Point (FSP) and the least was experienced by OPT LVL bonded with PVAc.

40|$|The {{research}} work {{described in this}} thesis {{is concerned with the}} development of glassfibre reinforced plastics for structural uses in Civil Engineering construction. The first stage was primarily concerned with the design of GRP lamintes with structura 1 properties and method of manufacture suitable for use with relatively large structural components. A <b>cold</b> <b>setting,</b> pressure moulding technique was developed which proved to be efficient in reducing the void content in the composite and minimising the exothermic effect due to curing. The effect of fibre content and fibre arrangement on strength and stiffness of the cornposite was studied and the maximum amount of' fibre content that could be reached by the adopted type of moulding technique was determined. The second stage of the project was concerned with the introduction of steel-wire "sheets" into the GRP cornposites, {{to take advantage of the}} high modulus of steel wire to improve the GRP stiffness and to reduce deformation. The experimental observations agreed reasonably well with theoretical predictions in both first and second stages of the work. The third stage was concerned with studying the stability of GRP flat rectangular plates subjected to uniaxial compression or pure shear, to simulate compression flanges or shear webs respectively. The investigation was concentrated on the effect of fibre arrangement in the plate on buckling load. The effect of the introduction of steel-wire sheets on the plate stability in compression was also investigated. The boundary conditions were chosen to be close to those usually assumed in built-up box-sections for both compression flanges and webs. The orthotropic plate and the mid-plane symmetric were used successfully in predicting the buckling load theoretically. In determining the buckling load experimentally, two methods were used. The Southwell plot method and electrical strain gauge method. The latter proved to be more reliable in predicting the buckling load than the former, especially for plates under uniaxial compression. Sample design charts for GRP plates that yield and buckle simultaneously under compression are also presented in the thesis. The final stage of the work dealt with the design and test of GRP beams. The investigation began by finding the optimum cross-section for a GRP beam. The cross-section which was developed was a thin walled corrugated section which showed higher stiffness than other cross-sections for the same cross-sectional area (i. e. box, I, and rectangular sections). A <b>cold</b> <b>setting,</b> hand layings technique was used in manufacturing these beams wbich were of nine types depending on the type of glass reinforcement employed and the arrangement of layers in the beam. The simple bending theory was used in the beam design and proved to be satisfactory in predicting the stresses and deflections. A factor of safety of 4 was chosen for design purposes and considered to be suitable for long term use under static load. Because of its relatively low modulus, GRP beams allowable deflection was limited to 1 / 120 th of the span which was found to be adequate for design purposes. A general discussion of the behaviour of GRP composites and their place relative to the more conventional structural material was also presented in the thesis...|$|E
40|$|Generally, it is {{relatively}} easy to obtain a high joint strength with most modern bonding systems if these are cured under ideal factory conditions. However, civil engineering construction joints are cured on site and are required to last the lifetime of the structural member in harsh environmental conditions. This implies that site joints might not be constructed and cured as well as those fabricated in the factory. The paper compares two possible methods for bonding an FRP composite patch/plate to a steel adherend suitable for construction sites. The first method utilises the accepted technique of bonding two dissimilar materials using a two-part cold cure adhesive. The second method employs a pre-impregnated FRP composite plate in conjunction with a compatible film adhesive; these comparisons are undertaken by examining the results of double-strap butt joint tests. A possible site technique using the pre-impregnated FRP composite to upgrade a steel beam whilst it is under a low frequency vibration load is investigated; this represents the repair of a steel bridge constantly under traversing traffic. The butt joint test results show that on average, the pre-impregnated composite in conjunction with the film adhesive leads to a failure load which is 15 % higher than that of the <b>cold</b> <b>setting</b> adhesive technique. The results of the rehabilitated beam tests show that the bonded joint between the pre-impregnated CFRP composite and the steel adherend did not suffer any significant damage from the low frequency vibrations imposed upon the steel beam during the cure period.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the the transient behavior of an automobile arr conditioning system was performed. The experiments were conducted on an original equipment air conditioning system modified for laboratory investigation. Qualitative results showing a clear relationship between refrigerant charge and mean clutch cycling period, and between refrigerant charge and the transient behavior of the evaporator outlet refrigerant temperature, were obtained. A five-factor, two-level, designed experiment was performed to determine {{the sensitivity of the}} clutch cycling period of the air conditioning refrigeration system to small (8 %- 15 %) changes in: condenser air flow rate, condenser air inlet temperature, evaporator air inlet temperature, compressor speed, and refrigerant mass. The values chosen for each factor were based on a nominal operating condition which assumed a vehicle speed of 60 mph, and an air conditioning system operating on maximum <b>cold</b> <b>setting,</b> full recirculation, and maximum evaporator speed. The test facility permitted the control of condenser and evaporator air flow rates and inlet air temperatures, compressor speed, and refrigerant charge. Evaporator fan speed was set at the same value for all tests, and all tests were run dry coil. For the range of variables studied, experimental results showed that refrigerant charge loss corresponded to a shortening of the mean clutch cycling period and a decrease in the variance of the mean clutch cycling period. Experimental results further showed that the transient behavior of the evaporator refrigerant outlet temperature, following each clutch engagement, was clearly a function of refrigerant charge. A parameter, Time to Temperature Turning, was defined which adequately describes this behavior in terms of time and temperature only. The results imply that a strong possiblity exists {{for the development of a}} real-time, on-line refrigerant charge loss diagnostic device based on temperature measurements and time.
