40|$|A talented, {{innovative}} workforce in science, technology, engineering, {{and mathematics}} (STEM) {{is a critical}} component of sustained economic growth and global competitiveness. The development of this workforce is a primary concern among policymakers, industry leaders, and academics. Although many students express an interest in STEM in secondary school, many of them eventually choose not to pursue a degree or career in a STEM field. This trend has been linked to inadequate achievement, but also to lack of confidence, inconsistent interest, and shifting motivation. It is important that we understand the development of precollege socialcognitive factors affecting persistence to help identify whether some trajectories might have more desirable outcomes than others, and points at which intervention efforts might best be targeted. Growth mixture modeling was used in the current study to uncover unobserved developmental subgroups of students’ attitudes toward science and positive <b>core</b> <b>self-concept</b> through their middle and high school years. Three distinct subgroups of change patterns were found for each of mastery motivation, attitudes toward science utility, and science self-concept. Science Self-Concept subgroups demonstrated significant and reasonably distinct associations with relevant science achievement, postsecondary, and career outcomes, where the results for Mastery Motivation and Science Utility subgroups were mixed. Science Utility and Science Self-Concept subgroups of developmental trajectories both exhibited plausible and appropriate associations with parent and demographic factors as well as initial student, parent, and teacher expectations about college and career. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{individual}} self, relational self, {{and collective}} self {{are important and}} meaningful aspects of identity. However, they plausibly differ in their relative importance such that one self lies closer to the motivational <b>core</b> of the <b>self-concept,</b> better represent the “home base” of selfhood, or, simply stated, is motivationally primary. Four multi-method studies tested the relative motivational-primacy of the selves. Despite their disparate methods, the studies yielded consistent evidence of a three-tiered hierarchy with the individual self at the top, followed by the relational self, and trailed at the bottom by the collective self. The same hierarchy emerged in the Eastern culture of China and the Western cultures of the US and UK. Such pancultural consistency suggests that the motivational hierarchy is a fundamental pattern of the human self. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, modern {{societies}} are ethnically, racially, and ideologically heterogeneous. Divided nations include Poland, where sexual minority rights polarize the elites {{and the public}} or the United States, where contentious debates have cropped up over issues ranging from immigration policy to evolution in the school curriculum. How might such political divides be bridged? Some theorists propose that deliberation, which exposes participants to opposing views, would encourage people to take those views into account in reconsidering their predilections, foster understanding, and ultimately contribute to social cohesion (see Delli Carpini, Cook, 2 ̆ 6 Jacobs, 2004). Other scholars, however, worry that when citizens encounter political disagreement, their strongly held predilections might alter the deliberative process and its effects (Walzer, 2005). When exposed to dissimilar views, people might be motivated to uphold their beliefs and emerge from deliberation with polarized attitudes (Nickerson, 1998) and with antagonistic attitudes towards the out-group. Both views remain prevalent, and each has its merits and drawbacks; and the existing evidence is not conclusive. ^ This dissertation aims to offer systematic evidence on potential disadvantages generated by deliberation. It examined three factors that may influence deliberative process and its outcomes, resulting in polarized views and intensified conflicts: psychological processes related to biased information processing, sociological factors that pertain to issue characteristics, and sociopolitical factors associated with mobilization to collective action. Two quasi-experimental studies were analyzed: the Electronic Dialogue Project, which entailed structured and moderated online groups discussing various sociopolitical issues and the Polish Dialogue Project, which involved heterogeneous groups debating sexual minority rights in face-to-face settings that approximated deliberative ideals. ^ Results indicate that, on average, participants in online discussions tended to maintain their views. At the same time, strongly opinionated participants {{were more likely than}} moderates to uphold or strengthen their opinions following discussions where they felt there was disagreement. This effect appeared on such 2 ̆ 2 hot 2 ̆ 2 issues as gun control or the death penalty, but not on 2 ̆ 2 cold 2 ̆ 2 issues—such as teacher funding or Internet voting—that do not engage moral positions, <b>core</b> values or <b>self-concepts.</b> Results also suggest that it is perceived disagreement, rather than actual expressed opposition during online discussions, that leads to these effects. ^ Results from the Polish Dialogue Project offer additional evidence that deliberative settings may exacerbate strong predilections. The results indicate that those strongly opinionated deliberators who perceived disagreement and conflict polarized on such issues as sexual minorities in the teaching profession, which were discussed by the groups. They also polarized on the issues that were not discussed, such as homosexuals being sinners. The results further find that all participants—especially strongly opinionated deliberators who perceived low and high disagreement and conflict—reported that their prior attitudes had strengthened. ^ Finally, following deliberations perceived as disagreeable and conflictual, participants with firmly held views were mobilized to such public and confrontational political actions around sexual minority rights as protesting or petitioning, but not to such communicative actions as discussing the issue or persuading others. Perceived disagreement and conflict also evoked a sense of a collective action frame, and primarily injustice, among strongly opinionated participants. A collective action frame, in turn, further mobilized those participants to communicative as well as to public and confrontational actions around sexual minority rights in Poland. ^ This dissertation concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for deliberative theory and research, as well as for practitioners who promote deliberations to bridge social cleavages and conflicts between oppositional groups. ...|$|R
40|$|Smoking control {{measures}} {{and the resulting}} falling prevalence of smoking {{are one of the}} public health success stories in Australia. However while approximately 17 percent of adults still smoke, prevalence data indicate that this is not evenly spread across the community. Smoking rates are much higher in marginalised groups such as Indigenous Australians, low socioeconomic status populations and those with mental health issues. Smoking rates are also higher in lesbian and bisexual women. This research attempts to answer the question why. While the majority of lesbian and bisexual women lead happy lives with good healthy lifestyle choices there is overwhelming evidence {{that this is not the}} case for all of these women. Higher rates of substance use, overweight and obesity, mental health and other health issues are reported. Smoking rates are higher than the wider Australian female population and this has been found in other Western countries as well. Using qualitative research methodology of grounded theory, in-depth interviews were undertaken with a group of women who identified as lesbian or bisexual and were either current smokers or recent ex-smokers. A comprehensive literature review was also completed and further qualitative data was obtained from one on-line lesbian social networking site. A conceptual framework of symbolic interactionism was used for the research approach, which allowed for issues of identity formation and reflection, social influence, and behaviour to be analysed. Both smoking and minority sexual identity have undergone rapid social change with the former becoming increasingly socially undesirable and the latter slowly becoming more socially accepted. This provides a backdrop for the reporting of the results of the research. In trying to explain the higher levels of smoking in this group, three core categories of dissonance, resolution and redefinition factors emerged. Knowledge, expectations, denial, identity, stigma, loss and fitting in all contribute to reported dissonance for participants in both their smoking behaviour and their sexual orientation identity. Resolution was reached through justification, identity declaration, minimising of social loss, reported positives of behaviour and ways of managing stigma. Redefinition factors were articulated as relating to changing social acceptability and life-course. The core categories are encapsulated in the <b>core</b> theme of <b>self-concept.</b> In discussing the results and providing recommendations for future action it became clear that minority membership of two groups, that of smokers and of sexual minority identity, play an important part in self-concept and to understand and address higher rates of smoking prevalence required acknowledgement of this. More inclusive mainstream smoking control interventions are required that acknowledge the unique and complex interplay of factors for this group. In addition there is scope for targeted interventions at a lesbian/bisexual women or gay community level as a clear connection to some community attributes was reported. Stigma at many levels (internalised, structural, covert and overt) and discrimination based on sexual orientation still exists in Australia and many countries. Until fundamental changes occur in the real acceptance of sexual orientation diversity at a broad community level, poor health in this minority group will result. Social change on both of these areas has been encouraging but there is still much work to be done for true equity to be reached. Smoking control has accomplished a measure of success however until low smoking prevalence is achieved in all marginalised populations there is still much to realise. Smoking is still the largest cause of preventable morbidity and mortality and therefore the public health dollar must stretch to encompass and succeed in these challenging areas before we can say that we have won the battle. This needs to be done while being cognisant of the stigma that is attached to being a smoker today. This research project adds to the literature by exploring and understanding the complexities of smoking behaviour in lesbian and bisexual women. Recommendations are made for public health interventions to address this...|$|R
