5|$|Akash (Ranbir Kapoor) {{lives in}} New York City; he has bankrupted his company {{and is in}} need of $12 million for paying the shareholders, but is unable to obtain a loan due to a stock market crash. He decides to jump off the George Washington Bridge. He meets Kiara (Priyanka Chopra), from San Francisco, who is also suicidal after <b>catching</b> <b>her</b> fiancé Kunal (Zayed Khan) {{cheating}} on her. Akash and Kiara attempt to kill themselves, but are prevented from doing so by the Coast Guard. Still suicidal, Akash deliberately allows himself to be hit by a car, and Kiara falls on the bridge and breaks her neck. Their suicide attempts are unsuccessful, and they end up in hospital together. When they are discharged, Kiara takes Akash to her apartment because his house has been seized by the bank.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Dubourdieu, Captain Péridier on Flore ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The {{battered}} Favorite led with an attempt to round Amphion and rake her before <b>catching</b> <b>her</b> in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention. The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers {{to bear on the}} British squadron. Hoste was prepared for this eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to wear, turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion and as a result the squadron's formation became disorganised. Favorite, which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to respond quickly enough to the manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.|$|E
5|$|The Naval Battle of Lemnos {{resulted}} from an Ottoman plan {{to lure the}} faster Georgios Averof away from the Dardanelles. The protected cruiser Hamidiye evaded the Greek blockade and broke out into the Aegean sea; the assumption was that the Greeks would dispatch Georgios Averof to hunt down Hamidiye. Despite the threat to Greek lines of communication posed by the cruiser, the Greek commander refused to detach Georgios Averof from her position. Georgios Averof appeared approximately 12miles from Lemnos; when the powerful Greek ship was spotted, the Ottomans turned to retreat with Georgios Averof in pursuit. She scored several hits on the fleeing Ottoman ships before breaking off the chase. Psara and her sisters were too slow {{to keep up with}} Georgios Averof, and played no part in the engagement. Since Georgios Averof was needed to keep the blockade, Psara and four destroyers were detached to hunt down Hamidiye. Psara was much slower than the Turkish cruiser, and had no real chance of <b>catching</b> <b>her,</b> and Hamidiye remained at large {{until the end of the}} war in May 1913.|$|E

5000|$|She {{was one of}} {{the three}} star players on the team collectively known as [...] "The Meeks": Randall, Chamique Holdsclaw, and Tamika <b>Catchings.</b> <b>Her</b> {{reputation}} as a standout defensive player won her the nickname [...] "Hard to Handle Randall".

25|$|Later that month, on the 25th, Dominica chased a French rowboat {{privateer}} {{for several}} hours before <b>catching</b> <b>her</b> {{in the lee of}} Dominica. The privateer was the Ravanche, armed with a 12-pounder carronade in her bows and several swivel guns. She had only 15 men on board, having taken three small vessels during her eight weeks out of Guadeloupe.|$|E
25|$|Her brother {{says the}} report of him <b>catching</b> <b>her</b> with his girlfriend is {{completely}} fabricated and that he never even spoke with the detective who wrote it. Similarly, Lieberman says the couple never fought at the courthouse after her arraignment. The police, they believe, were extrapolating from what little they could find {{in an effort to}} make up for their early inattention to the case.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} an aspectual frame is the unrealized inceptive aspect ('just about to X'), {{illustrated}} here with the verb 'to tell'. 'To tell' is an indexical (directional) verb, where the index finger (a G hand) begins with a touch to the chin and then moves outward {{to point out the}} recipient of the telling. 'To be just about to tell' retains just the locus and the initial chin touch, which now becomes the final hold of the sign; all other features from the basic verb (in this case, the outward motion and pointing) are dropped and replaced by features from the frame (which are shared with the unrealized inceptive aspects of other verbs such as 'look at', 'wash the dishes', 'yell', 'flirt', etc.). These frame features are: Eye gaze toward the locus (which is no longer pointed at with the hand), an open jaw, and a hand (or hands, in the case of two-hand verbs) in front of the trunk which moves in an arc to the onset location of the basic verb (in this case, touching the chin), while the trunk rotates and the signer inhales, <b>catching</b> <b>her</b> breath during the final hold. The hand shape throughout the sign is whichever is required by the final hold, in this case a G hand.|$|E

500|$|Kate {{reported}} to police {{that when she}} called to her mother after escaping onto the garage roof, Green had been [...] "terribly upset" [...] and called to Kate to jump into her arms. Though Green missed <b>catching</b> <b>her</b> daughter when she did jump, Kate was not hurt. When the two ran into Farrar minutes later, Kate said that Farrar had been accusatory toward Green and Green had been crying and worried about her missing children.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{performed}} [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] live {{on several}} television and award show appearances around the world, {{as well as}} on her concert tours. The song's music video, directed by Brett Ratner, {{is one of the most}} expensive ever made, costing over $2.5 million. The video features Carey and her friends visiting a film theater and <b>catching</b> <b>her</b> boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) on a date with another woman. Carey played herself and a brunette villainess named Bianca, during a physical altercation scene in between the two women. Due to contractual agreements at the time of its filming, Jay-Z was unable to make an appearance in the video, instead being portrayed as an animated cartoon. The video was inspired by several films including Grease and Enter the Dragon.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jack learns from NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) {{that he has}} bedbugs. As {{a result}} of being ostracized due to his condition, and now feeling compassionate, Jack tells Liz to give {{everyone}} a chance to audition, after <b>catching</b> <b>her</b> {{trying to get rid of}} people trying out. During the audition process, Jack, Liz, and Pete witness auditions from TGS staff writers Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), J.D. Lutz (John Lutz), NBC news anchor Brian Williams, Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot), the daughter of General Electric (GE) CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn), [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown), former TGS cast member Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), and a robot street performer (Daniel Genalo). During Jayden's audition, Liz realizes that Jayden's supposed references—Gilbert Godfried, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Walken—were not legit and that Jayden impersonated them. She confronts him about this, however, Jayden plans to blackmail Liz with a camera marked by her fingerprints—that features provocative photos of Jayden, to make it look like Liz would only hire him if he would let her take pictures of his genitals. Liz tries to stop Jack from casting Jayden, though Jack has made up his mind in hiring the robot street performer. Jack casts him after he shook his hand without being concerned that Jack had bedbugs.|$|E

2500|$|John Wayne's other daughter, Melinda Ann, {{was also}} married at Blessed Sacrament in a {{ceremony}} attended by Cesar Romero, Jeanne Crain, Irene Dunne, and Loretta Young.

It reached number seven on the UK Singles Chart.

2500|$|On 2 January 1807 Circes boats {{took the}} {{privateer}} Creole, of one gun and 28 men. On 5 April she took Austerlitz after an 18-hour pursuit. Austerlitz was armed with eighteen 6-pounder guns {{and had a}} crew of 125 men.

2500|$|At {{the time}} of HMS Britons launch, the United Kingdom was {{at war with the}} United States and France such that vessels of either country were {{considered}} legitimate prizes of war.
