This paper looks into the effect on base pressure of applying a high aspect ratio <b>chamfer</b> to <b>all</b> <b>edges</b> of a simplified squareback model (the Windsor model). The effects are investigated using force and moment measurements along with surface pressure measurements on the slanted surface and vertical base. The work forms part of a larger study to develop understanding of the mechanisms that influence overall base pressure and hence the resulting aerodynamic drag. A short slant (approx. 4...|$|R

This problem can be solved with a simple algorithm that traverses <b>all</b> <b>edges</b> at most twice, and no algorithm can do better in the worst case. Artificial Intelligence researchers, however, often use the following online nearest neighbor algorithm: “repeatedly take a shortest path to the closest unexplored edge and traverse it. ” We prove bounds on the worst-case complexity of this algorithm. We show, for example, that its worst-case complexity is close to optimal for some classes of graphs, such as graphs with linear or star topology and dense graphs with edge lengths one. In general, however, its complexity can grow faster than linear in the sum of <b>all</b> <b>edge</b> lengths, although not faster than log(V) times the sum of <b>all</b> <b>edge</b> lengths...|$|R

40|$|We use density {{functional}} {{theory to}} determine the equilibrium shape of graphene flakes, through the calculation of the edge orientation dependence of the edge energy and edge stress of graphene nanoribbons. The edge energy is a nearly linear function of edge orientation angle; increasing from the armchair orientation to the zigzag orientation. Reconstruction of the zigzag edge lowers its energy to {{less than that of}} the armchair edge. The <b>edge</b> stress for <b>all</b> <b>edge</b> orientations is compressive, however, reconstruction of the zigzag edge reduces this edge stress to near zero. Hydrogen adsorption is favorable for <b>all</b> <b>edge</b> orientations; dramatically lowering <b>all</b> <b>edge</b> energies and <b>all</b> <b>edge</b> stresses. It also removes the reconstruction of the zigzag edge. Using the new edge energy data, we determine the equilibrium shape of a graphene sheet (with unreconstructed edges) to be hexagonal with straight armchair edges in the presence and absence of hydrogen. However, zigzag edge reconstruction produces graphene flakes with a six-fold symmetry, but with rounded edges. This shape is dominated by near zigzag edges. The compressive edge stresses will lead to edge buckling (out-of-the-plane of the graphene sheet) for <b>all</b> <b>edge</b> orientations, in the absence of hydrogen. Exposing the graphene flake to hydrogen dramatically decreases the buckling amplitude...|$|R
