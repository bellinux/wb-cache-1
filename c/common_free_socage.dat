50|$|Land {{was subject}} to feudal tenure and could be held in allod or fief, the latter coming in two {{distinct}} forms—either <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> (seigneurie) or villein <b>socage</b> (roture). <b>Free</b> <b>socage</b> was considered 'noble' (but the owner {{did not have to}} be a member of the nobility) and the latter 'peasant'.|$|R

Estates in <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> (seigneuries) were subject to different rules of inheritance, and estates in villein socage had to be partitioned equally. A <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> was inherited unequally with half going to the eldest son and the rest being divided equally among his siblings.|$|R

5000|$|On 12 May 1555 he {{was granted}} by Queen Mary a 30-year lease (in <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> for a rent of £29 3s per annum) of the escheated manor and lordship of Great Torrington, caput of a feudal barony, in North Devon. The grant {{included}} Town Mills, all markets and fairs with their profits, various local woodlands and [...] "all other lands and franchises belonging {{either to the}} lordship, the borough or the town".|$|R
5000|$|An English barony is a peerage (yet the {{abolition}} act of 1660 allows for some remaining non-peer baronies not converted by writ {{to remain as}} feudal baronies of <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> [...] "incorporeal hereditament" [...] similar to a lordship of the manor), but whether Scottish barons rightfully rank as peers is disputable. [...] They are known as minor barons currently treated as noble titles of less than peerage rank. The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is [...] "Lord of Parliament".|$|R
5000|$|Under the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, many baronies by tenure were {{converted}} into baronies by writ. The rest {{ceased to exist}} as feudal baronies by tenure, becoming baronies in <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> {{that is to say}} under a [...] "free" [...] (hereditable) contract requiring payment of monetary rents. Thus baronies could no longer be held by military service. Parliamentary titles of honour had been limited since the 15th century by the Modus Tenenda Parliamenta act, and could thenceforth only be created by writ of summons or letters patent.|$|R
50|$|Estates in <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> {{were the}} most macro-level of land {{division}} in New France but, within them, there existed several tenurial subdivisions. Immediately {{below the level of}} <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> was that of the villeinage (roture). Throughout New France, there came to exist several thousand estates in villeinage. Furthermore, these villein tenancies were remarkably uniform in terms of size. Barring extreme cases, it is estimated that around 95% of all villein estates were between 40 and 200 square arpents, or (7,680' ft and 38,400' ft) in size, though most were likely 120 arpents or less. Estates of less than 40 square arpents were considered to be of little value by villein socagers.To maximize simplicity when surveying, estates in villein socage were almost invariably distributed in rectangular plots following a rowed system wherein the first row bordered the river, and was the first to be filled, followed by the second behind it and so on. Typically, the proportions of such rectangles coincided with the ratio of 1:10 for width and length, respectively. However, extremes {{all the way up to}} 1:100 are known to have occurred. This method of land division confers obvious advantages in terms of easy access to transportation and cheap surveying, but also allowed socagers to live remarkably close to families on neighboring plots—often within a few hundred yards—creating something of a proto-neighborhood.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{adoption}} of summons by writ, baronies thus no longer relate directly to land-holding, and thus no more feudal baronies needed thenceforth to be created. Following the Modus Tenendi Parliamenta of 1419, the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, the Feudal Tenure Act (1662), and the Fines and Recoveries Act of 1834, titles of feudal barony became obsolete and without legal force. The Abolition Act 1660 specifically states: baronies by tenure were converted into baronies by writ. The rest ceased to exist as feudal baronies by tenure, becoming baronies in <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> {{that is to say}} under a [...] "free" [...] (hereditable) contract requiring payment of monetary rents.|$|R
50|$|Josceline le Deneys (whose {{first name}} was Latinised to Jollenus, Jellanus or Joscelinus) was {{recorded}} in the 1166 Cartae Baronum return submitted by Henry de Pomeroy, feudal baron of Berry Pomeroy in South Devon, as holding from him the manor of Pancrasweek, Black Torrington hundred, North Devon, and de Pomeroy himself held it from Tavistock Abbey. This Jollenus Dacus held Pancrasweek as one knight's fee on military feudal tenure. Orleigh formed a sub-manor of Pancrasweek, but was held by him under the non-military tenure of <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> {{that is to say}} it was a heritable estate the service for which was monetary not military. Dacus held two fees in total from de Pomeroy, as stated in his 1166 return.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{attainder}} of the Marquis of Exeter the Courtenay lands escheated to the Crown, {{and those}} within Colyton were sold back for £1,000 to various residents of Colyton parish, as listed in a deed transcribed in the Letters and Papers of Henry VIII dated 6 January 1547, summarised as [...] "John Clarke and others. Grant in <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> subject to rents etc. (specified), for l,000l., {{of the following}} lands (extents given) in the parish of Colyton, which are parcels of Colyton manor, Devon, and belonged to Henry Marquis of Exeter, attainted". [...] This was {{the origin of the}} Feoffees of Colyton, who continued to hold in common various properties in the parish.|$|R
50|$|Under feudal tenure, a fief {{could not}} be owned {{outright}} but was instead divided into competing interests known as estates in land; thus, a single tract of land could be held both in villein socage by a tenant and in <b>free</b> <b>socage</b> by {{the lord of the}} manor. Villein socage was subject to a number of real burdens and feudal incidents owed to the manorial landlord. For example, the Custom provided for the payment of an annual feu-duty (the cens) by villein socagers to the landlord as both revenue and as a token of submission. The entry fine (lods et ventes) was another mandatory payment, a conveyance fee for villein socages and amounting to a twelfth of the sales price, and derived from the feu-duty, as were other fees and the right of laudatio (retrait lignager).|$|R
5000|$|Feudal {{land tenure}} existed in many varieties. The sole {{surviving}} {{form in the}} United States is that species of freehold known as <b>free</b> <b>socage.</b> Here the service to be performed is known and fixed, and not of a base or servile nature; the [...] "lord of the fee" [...] is the State itself, and the service due to this [...] "lord" [...] is payment of the taxes upon the real estate. The major consequences, in the modern world, of this feudal approach, as distinguished from ownership, are, first, the forfeiture of the tenement upon failure to perform the service (that is, non-payment of taxes), and second, the doctrine of eminent domain, whereby the [...] "lord of the fee" [...] might take back the estate, provided he make just compensation. Also existing in a vestigial form {{is the concept of}} escheat, under which an estate of a holder without heirs returns to the ownership of the state.|$|R
5000|$|Royal {{charters}} {{granted to}} English colonists in North America, often used {{the name of}} the manor of East Greenwich for describing the tenure (from the Latin verb teneo, hold) as that of <b>free</b> <b>socage.</b> New England charters provided that the grantees should hold their lands [...] "as of his Majesty’s manor of East Greenwich." [...] This was in relation to the principle of land tenure under English law, that the ruling monarch (king or queen) was paramount lord of all the soil in the terra regis, while all others held their lands, directly or indirectly, under the monarch. Land outside the physical boundaries of England, as in America, was treated as belonging constructively to one of the existing royal manors, and from Tudor times grants frequently used {{the name of the}} manor of East Greenwich, but some 17c. grants named the castle of Windsor. Places in North America that have taken the name [...] "East Greenwich" [...] include a township in Gloucester County, New Jersey, a hamlet in Washington County, New York, and a town in Kent County, Rhode Island.|$|R

In 1285 however Robert le Deneys was holding these manors not from the de Pomeroy barons but from the heirs of Patrick de Chaworth, who was successor in title to Brewer, lord of the manor of Buckland Brewer amongst others, who had himself purchased them from de Pomeroy.|$|R
40|$|The Arden area of north-west Warwickshire {{developed}} {{its regional}} personality {{during the early}} Middle Ages {{as the result of}} being by-passed by the main wave of Anglo-Saxon colonisation. From the eleventh to the early fourteenth centuries the area saw a vigorous colonising movement whose character was determined partially by the extent of early settlement, and hence the amount of woodland and waste surviving, and partially by seigniorial policy. This movement differed from the Anglo-Saxon colonisation, which led to the establishment of common open fields, in that clearing was a matter of private initiative and resulted in the creation of enclosed several ties. Manorial lords were compelled to offer some form of inducement to settlers, and this took the form of a less rigid application of the manorial regime, so that the typical tenure of Arden was <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> and dues were largely rendered in cash. These concessions encouraged the movement of population into the area especially those manors where free tenure was predominant, and led indirectly to the appearance of a vigorous land market. The processes of fragmentation, agglomeration and exchange which resulted from this encouraged social mobility, and led to the emergence of sub-manors in the hands of wealthy free tenants, and to a {{reduction in the number of}} small independent freeholdings. While the economy of Arden was based upon true mixed fanning, it is likely that pastoralism produced much of the capital available to both lord and peasant...|$|R

5000|$|Henry Machyn stated Edward Lewkenor to {{have been}} Groom Porter to King Edward VI, a fact lacking {{positive}} confirmation from other sources. (This office included responsibility for royal games at cards). Thomas Wroth, who was knighted in 1547, was successively Gentleman Usher to the Prince's Chamber (1541-1547), Gentleman of the Privy Chamber (1547-49) and a principal Gentleman (1549-53) to the King: he was also Knight of the Shire for Middlesex in the parliaments of 1547, 1549 and March 1553. Lewknor {{is likely to have}} gained his position in the royal household through his brother-in-law's connections and the influence of Richard Rich. In 1548 Margaret Lewknor was the demesne lessee of the manor of High Barns at Upper Beeding, Sussex, a property seized by the Crown from the attainted Duke of Norfolk, which had been granted to Thomas Seymour in 1547. Following Seymour's attainder in 1549, on 21 May 1553 it, together with the site of the former Bramber Castle and the disparked lands called Le Newe Park at Upper Beeding were granted in chief by the King to Edward Lewknor, King's Servant, Esquire, for the fortieth part of a knight's fee and in consideration of £718.8s.8d paid to Sir Edmund Peckham on behalf of the King. Lewknor was also granted the house of the former Butler Chantry cantarista in Horsham, and several tenements appertaining to it, in <b>free</b> <b>socage.</b> The acquisition of the site at Bramber was no doubt a visible assertion or impropriation of Lewknor's perceived de Braose ancestry or forbears.|$|R

5000|$|The English feudal barony, or [...] "barony by tenure", now has {{no legal}} existence. It {{was the highest}} form of feudal land tenure, namely per baroniam (Latin for [...] "by barony") under which the {{land-holder}} owed the now little understood service of [...] "being one of the king's barons". It must be distinguished from the lesser barony, also feudal, which existed within a county palatine, such as the barony of Halton within the Palatinate of Chester. Such barons were merely tenants-in-chief of a prince, whose own overlord was the king. The duties and privileges owed by feudal barons cannot now be defined exactly but the main duty certainly was the provision of soldiers to the royal feudal army on demand by the king, and a further duty, which involved considerable expense and travel, clearly also a privilege, was the attendance at the king's feudal court, the precursor of Parliament. The principal benefit clearly was the revenue generated from rents and production within the demesne lands of the barony, and also the personal power and prestige derived from the feudal service of the tenants, {{the highest level of}} whom, lords of their own manors, became knights in the baron's retinue. The estate-in-land held by barony if containing a significant castle as its caput and if especially large, that is to say consisting of more than about 20 knight's fees (each loosely equivalent to a manor), was termed an [...] "honour". Constituent manors of a barony were mostly subinfeudated by the baron to his own knights or followers, with a few retained tenantless as his demesne. Most English Feudal Barons were converted to baronies of writ or peerage according to the Abolition Act of 1660. The baronies not converted became baronies of <b>free</b> <b>socage,</b> a dignity title.|$|R
