5|$|As it grew {{beyond its}} {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, <b>college</b> <b>football</b> garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu {{of an actual}} national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's <b>college</b> <b>football</b> teams. Since there was no national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of <b>college</b> <b>football.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>College</b> <b>football</b> {{maintained}} {{a tradition of}} postseason bowl games. Each bowl game {{would be associated with}} a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of <b>college</b> <b>football.</b> The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way in 1997 to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the <b>College</b> <b>Football</b> Playoff (CFP).|$|E
