40|$|Since 2004 {{the newly}} {{developed}} 3 D lightning detection network LINET utilizes VLF/LF techniques for measurements of distinct pulses with waveforms and amplitudes that often resemble the ones typical for return strokes but occur inside thunder-clouds {{and do not}} <b>connect</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground.</b> For simplicity, these distinct signals are termed ‘IC-strokes’. The determined emission heights represent a new data source and call for further explanation. In a first attempt {{to understand the nature}} of these IC-strokes, 3 D scans from polarimetric high-resolution radar of DLR (POLDIRAD) have been used for comparison, giving verification that the heights coincide with regions of graupel and ice aloft. A more specific IC-stroke analysis was carried out in 2010 : a 7 -sensor LINET system was set up at Kennedy Space Center (Florida) enabling a comparison with 3 D lightning data from 4 DLSS (also called LDAR 2), the high-resolution VHF network operated by NASA. It turned out that the emission heights of LINET IC-strokes fit perfectly into channels defined by radio source points from 4 DLSS, no matter whether these channels were located in lower (10 km) altitudes, and independent of whether the discharge was a ground- or a cloud flash. In fact, the accuracy of LINET heights was mostly better than 10...|$|E

2500|$|Electrical {{circuits}} may be <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> (earth) {{for several}} reasons. [...] In mains powered equipment, exposed metal parts are <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> prevent user contact with dangerous voltage when electrical insulation fails. [...] In electrical power distribution systems, a protective ground conductor {{is an essential}} part of the safety earthing system. [...] Connection <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> also limits the build-up of static electricity when handling flammable products or electrostatic-sensitive devices. In some telegraph and power transmission circuits, the earth itself can be used as one conductor of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate return conductor (see single-wire earth return).|$|R

25|$|Strictly speaking, {{the terms}} {{grounding}} or earthing {{are meant to}} refer to an electrical connection to ground/earth. Bonding is the practice of intentionally electrically connecting metallic items not designed to carry electricity. This brings all the bonded items to the same electrical potential as a protection from electrical shock.

50|$|In some DC circuits, a {{varistor}} or two inverse-series Zener diodes (collectively {{called a}} Transil or Transorb) {{may be used}} instead of the simple diode. Because these devices dissipate significant power, the relay may drop-out faster than it would with a simple rectifier diode. An advantage to using a transorb over just one diode {{is that it will}} protect against over voltage with both polarities, if <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground,</b> forcing the voltage to stay between the confines of the breakdown voltages of the Zener diodes. A Zener diode <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> will protect against positive transients to the value of the Zener breakdown, and will protect against negative transients greater than a normal forward diode drop.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the ways}} to bond or {{electrically}} <b>connect</b> personnel <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> is the use of an ESD garment. ESD garments have conductive threads in them, creating a wearable version of a faraday cage. ESD garments attempt to shield ESD sensitive devices from harmful static charges from clothing such as wool, silk, and synthetic fabrics on people working with them. For these garments to work properly, they must also be <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> with a strap. Most ESD garments are not conductive enough <b>to</b> provide personal <b>grounding</b> so antistatic foot straps and antistatic wrist straps are also worn. ESD garments are considered an optional method to control ESD.|$|R
50|$|To {{protect a}} unit of {{equipment}} from transients occurring on an attached conductor, a surge arrester is <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> the conductor just before it enters the equipment. The surge arrester is also <b>connected</b> <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> and functions by routing energy from an over-voltage transient <b>to</b> <b>ground</b> if one occurs, while isolating the conductor from ground at normal operating voltages. This is usually achieved through use of a varistor, which has substantially different resistances at different voltages.|$|R
50|$|Most microcontrollers' pins {{are high}} {{impedance}} inputs or mixed inputs and outputs.
