5|$|Although {{crystallography}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve the structure of a complicated arrangement of atoms. Pure, regular crystals <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> be obtained from natural or synthetic materials, such as samples of metals, minerals or other macroscopic materials. The regularity of such crystals <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> be improved with macromolecular crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.|$|E

Val de <b>Cans</b> (<b>sometimes</b> spelled Val de Cães) {{is the name of}} the {{neighborhood}} where the airport is located. Since 13 April 2010 the airport is named also after Júlio Cezar Ribeiro de Souza (1837-1887) a researcher of balloons.|$|R

Enemies <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> seem to be dead when they are not, where the enemy can still wield his side arm and fire at the player.|$|E
5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a {{temperature}} inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (violet, blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the violet and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E

Not all Wise Ones can channel, but all Aiel women who can channel become Wise Ones.|$|R
5|$|Apart from headache, about 50% of {{patients}} experience neck pain or stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms include dizziness and vertigo, facial numbness or weakness, unusually blurry or double vision, neuralgia, fatigue, or a metallic taste in the mouth.

5|$|Disjunct {{populations of}} the giant {{freshwater}} stingray in separate river drainages are probably isolated from one another; though the species occurs in brackish environments, {{there is no evidence}} that it crosses marine waters. This is a bottom-dwelling species that favors a sandy or muddy habitat. Unexpectedly, it <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> be found near heavily populated urban areas.|$|E

5|$|Due to the breed's {{elongated}} body, {{there can}} be back problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's back. These discs <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> slip out of place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on {{what part of the}} dog's back is affected; they can include paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases.|$|E
5|$|Inversions. When on a {{clear and}} calm night, a {{radiation}} inversion is formed near the ground, the friction does not affect wind above {{the top of the}} inversion layer. The change in wind can be 90degrees in direction and 40kt in speed. Even a nocturnal (overnight) low level jet <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> be observed. It tends to be strongest towards sunrise. Density differences cause additional problems to aviation.|$|E
5|$|Patterns {{in nature}} are visible regularities of form {{found in the}} natural world. These {{patterns}} recur in different contexts and <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> be modelled mathematically. Natural patterns include symmetries, trees, spirals, meanders, waves, foams, tessellations, cracks and stripes. Early Greek philosophers studied pattern, with Plato, Pythagoras and Empedocles attempting to explain order in nature. The modern understanding of visible patterns developed gradually over time.|$|E

5|$|Psychiatric {{problems}} due to Wilson's {{disease may}} include behavioral changes, depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen {{in conjunction with}} neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own. These symptoms are often poorly defined and <b>can</b> <b>sometimes</b> be attributed to other causes. Because of this, diagnosis of Wilson's disease is rarely made when only psychiatric symptoms are present.|$|E
5|$|Statives are a {{class of}} predicative words expressing a quality or state, whose {{syntactic}} properties fall in between those of verbs and adjectives in Indo-European languages.

Statives can be adjectives, positionals or numerals.|$|E
