5000|$|Duchess of Montrose {{was similar}} in design to [...] with {{modifications}} based on experience. A double-ended, coal-fired Scotch boiler operated {{at a more}} traditional pressure (180 psi) than those trialled on the [...] "King". The screws were driven directly, eliminating the gear equipment of the earlier vessel. She had a <b>centre</b> <b>screw</b> driven by the high-pressure turbine and two screws driven by the two low pressure turbines. The two low pressure turbines incorporated [...] "astern turbines" [...] for reversing.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} liner SS Cap Trafalgar was {{built at the}} AG Vulcan Shipyard on the Elbe River in Hamburg, Germany for the Hamburg-South America Line for their service between Germany and the River Plate (RÃ­o de la Plata). She was named after the Spanish Cape Trafalgar, scene of the famous Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. A three-funneled vessel of 613 ft length and 72 ft beam, she measured 18,710 GRT and could carry nearly 1,600 passengers (400 1st class, 276 2nd class, 913 3rd or steerage class. A triple-screw vessel, her outer propellers were powered by two triple-expansion steam engines, and the <b>centre</b> <b>screw</b> by an exhaust turbine, an arrangement {{similar to that of}} the RMS Titanic.|$|R

50|$|Cusco's self {{retaining}} bivalved speculum is {{a surgical}} instrument used for vaginal and cervical examination. It has a jaw which opens {{up like a}} duck bill. It comes in three models : side scew, <b>centre</b> <b>screw</b> and in special narrow virgin size. The Cusco's speculum is usually 80mm long and 22 mm broad. However, smaller and larger sizes are available. Cusco's speculum is used for introducing an intrauterine contraceptive device, taking a Pap smear, cauterization of vaginal erosion and for colposcopic examination. It is preferred in cryosurgery because it protects the anterior and posterior vaginal wall. The advantage of Cusco's speculum {{is that it is}} self-retaining. Therefore, an assistant's help is not needed to keep the speculum in place. It also acts as the vaginal wall retractor. However, it reduces the space in the vaginal cavity and therefore is not a preferred instrument for vaginal surgery. Since it covers most of the vaginal wall, small lesions on the vaginal wall may be masked by the blades of the device.|$|R
5000|$|In 1862, Thwaites and Carbutt {{exhibited}} {{a selection of}} machine tools at the London Exhibition. These included a seven hundredweight double-action self-acting steam hammer; a four hundredweight double-action single standard hammer; a pillar radial drilling machine; a six-inch <b>centre</b> slide and <b>screw</b> cutting lathe; a [...] "very powerful" [...] planing machine; and a ten-inch centre double-geared slide lathe.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on the {{incompressible}} smoothed particle hydrodynamics (ISPH) method, {{a program}} {{was developed to}} simulate the non-Newtonian fluid flow in the mixing section of a single screw extruder. The transverse flow in the extruder is mimicked by one 2 -D lid-driven cavity flow. The mirror particles are used to treat boundary. The power-law model {{is used to calculate}} the viscosity of the fluid. The shear-thinning, the shear-thickening and Newtonian fluid in the single screw extruder are simulated and deeply analyzed. Through comparing the velocity profile along the <b>centre</b> of <b>screw</b> extruder with the theoretical solution, this method has been proven to be accurate and effective. It laid the foundation for the simulating of the more complex 3 -D model...|$|R
50|$|It may {{be noted}} that due to radial {{movement}} of the legs, plumb bob gets shifted {{in the direction of}} the movement of the leg without seriously affecting the level of the instrument. On the other hand, when the legs are moved side ways or circumferentially, the plumb does not shift much but the level gets affected. Sometimes, the instrument and the tripod have to be moved bodily for centring. It must {{be noted that}} the centering and leveling of instrument is done recursively. Finally, exact centring is done by using the shifting head of the instrument. During this, first the screw-clamping ring of the shifting head is loosened and the upper plate of the shifting head is slid over the lower one until the plumb bob is exactly over the station mark. After the exact <b>centring,</b> the <b>screw</b> clamping ring gets tightened.|$|R
50|$|On the Strood side of {{the bridge}} was the ship passage: a channel 40 feet m in width. It was spanned by a swing bridge {{consisting}} of six wrought iron girders turning on a cast iron roller path, 30 feet m in diameter with 30 cast iron rollers. The <b>centre</b> wrought iron <b>screw</b> was 11 in in diameter. The swing bridge was delicately balanced. The total weight of the swing bridge and roadway was over 300 tonnes, it could have been rotated with ease 90 degrees upriver.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} forms of wall plug, but the most common {{principle}} {{is to use a}} tapered tube of soft material, such as plastic. This is inserted loosely into a drilled hole, then a screw is tightened into the <b>centre.</b> As the <b>screw</b> enters the plug, the soft material of the plug expands conforming tightly to the wall material. Such anchors can attach one object to another in situations where screws, nails, adhesives, or other simple fasteners are either impractical or ineffective. Different types have different levels of strength and can be used on different types of surfaces.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper uses a {{case study}} to {{illustrate}} the problems which can occur when using small feeders to dose at low rates, with materials which are not totally free flowing. The general principles of good design for small feeders are enlarged upon, together with issues to look for when trouble shooting these equipment items. The system in question used a screw to dose a moist pelleted talc into a process at a nominal rate which was variable at around 1 t/h and originally suffered from poor flow in the hopper, a variable dosing rate and binding of the screw, thus needing constant attention from the operator to keep it working. Various types of mechanical flow assistance device had been tried, most of which made the problem worse. The Wolfson <b>Centre</b> redesigned the <b>screw</b> and hopper of the unit, and the performance problems were cleared. The problems with the original and intermediate designs serve to illustrate very well the points {{that need to be}} observed, in obtaining good performance from small feeders...|$|R
