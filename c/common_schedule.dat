A {{combination of these}} is the Priority Weighted Round Robin (PWRR) scheme, which serves three classes of traffic with distinct quality requirements, namely expedited forwarding (EF), assured forwarding (AF) and best effort forwarding (BF). The response time of the AF class is analysed under a worst case scenario and an expression for its mean value is obtained using a queueing model. Numerical results are validated by simulation and implications on service level agreements are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{real-time}} {{systems that}} contain a large variety of application constraints, such as embedded systems, the most <b>common</b> <b>scheduling</b> {{approach is to}} resolve potential conflicts off-line by generating a fixed time-table for {{the execution of the}} tasks. Unfortunately, the generation of such a schedule is an NP-complete problem which implies that the runtime complexity of an exact scheduling algorithm is exponential in the worst case. Moreover, the amount of different constraints that must be considered makes it hard to devise a reasonably efficient algorithm without sacrificing solution quality or model accuracy. In this work we show how a scheduling algorithm based on constraint programming is able to tackle these difficulties...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>common</b> <b>schedule</b> and {{the focus}} on the circle around John of Damascus is {{confirmed}} by a ninth-century treatise called [...] "Hagiopolites" [...] (from hagios polis, [...] "Holy City", referring to Jerusalem) which only survived in a complete form as a late copy.

The Hagiopolitan emphasis on John of Damascus was obviously the late result of a 9th-century redaction around the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, so {{it was part of the}} later Studites reform between Jerusalem and Constantinople and it was motivated theologically, not only because of his contributions to the tropologion, but also because of the keyrole which John of Damascus' polemic against the iconoclasts had during this Council.|$|E
40|$|Six pigeons {{were trained}} on {{multiple}} variable-interval schedules and performance {{was measured in}} {{the presence or absence}} of another variable-interval schedule (the <b>common</b> <b>schedule)</b> arranged concurrently with both components.

Both concurrent and multiple schedule performance undermatched obtained reinforcement-rate ratios, but the degree of undermatching in multiple schedules was reliably greater. Allocation of responses between multiple schedule components was unaffected by the concurrent availability of reinforcement, and allocation of responses between concurrent schedules was unaffected by the successive availability of different reinforcement rates...|$|E
