50|$|Four spruce {{longerons}} {{formed the}} basis of the fuselage, which was plywood-covered forward from the cockpit area. The gunner's position, with a rotatable machine gun mounting, was close behind the smaller cockpit for the pilot. Both were equipped with heating and oxygen. Aft of the gunner the fuselage was fabric-covered apart from <b>curved</b> <b>plywood</b> decking. A clipped triangular tailplane mounted on the upper longerons carried near rectangular, horn-balanced elevators. The fin was straight-edged and the rudder also horn-balanced.|$|E

"The Ruspan Originals {{line was}} boxy and geometric, {{but most of}} all it was simple, {{functional}} and modern, all qualities that appealed to young post-war couples buying furniture for their new houses or apartments."Spanner's designs utilized innovative manufacturing techniques such as <b>curved</b> <b>plywood</b> and non-upholstered, woven-web seating. Many of the designs reused components and shared consistent proportions, which gave his work a characteristic aesthetic. Among his three residential furniture lines (Ruspan Originals, Catalina, and Pasadena) the Lounge Chair with Arms has been described as the [...] "best-known and most desirable" [...] design.|$|E
500|$|The {{pavilion}} by van Berkel of UNStudio, {{referred to}} by some as the UNStudio pavilion, is composed of two parallel rectangular planes joined by curving scoops. [...] It is built on a steel frame and has a skin of glossy white plywood that starts off in familiar right angles and that graduates into double <b>curves</b> of bent <b>plywood.</b> It is situated on a raised platform and it hosts a grid of 42 computer-controlled, LED lights {{on the underside of}} the roof. The floor slab is cantilevered and is sliced by a ramp entrance making it ADA accessible. The roof, which is described as floating, also has eye-like openings. [...] The pavilion is composed of steel donated by Chicago-based ArcelorMittal and is intended to be de-constructed and recycled.|$|R
50|$|The wooden, {{rectangular}} fuselage was plywood-covered to {{just behind}} the pilot's seat and fabric-covered further aft apart from a <b>curved</b> <b>plywood</b> decking behind the cabin. The fin was integral with the fuselage and unusually shallow with the variable incidence tailplane mounted on top of it, a little above the fuselage and bearing damped elevators. The balanced rudder was much taller than the fin. The enclosed cabin seated two {{in tandem with the}} front seat under the upper wing and over the centre of gravity. Dual control was fitted. In front, a Walter Mikron inverted 4-cylinder engine drove a two-bladed propeller.|$|E
5000|$|Charles and Ray Eames {{aimed to}} develop {{furniture}} that could be mass-produced and affordable, {{with the exception of}} the Eames Lounge Chair. This luxury item was inspired by the traditional English Club Chair. The Eames Lounge Chair is an icon of Modern style design, although when it was first made, Ray Eames remarked in a letter to Charles that the chair looked [...] "comfortable and un-designy". Charles's vision was for a chair with [...] "the warm, receptive look of a well-used first baseman's mitt." [...] The chair is composed of three <b>curved</b> <b>plywood</b> shells: the headrest, the backrest and the seat. In early production, beginning in 1956 and running through the very early 1990s, the shells were made up of five thin layers of plywood which were covered by a veneer of Brazilian rosewood. The use of Brazilian rosewood was discontinued in the early 1990s, and current production since then consists of seven layers of plywood covered by finishing veneers of cherry, walnut, Palisander rosewood (a sustainably grown wood with similar grain patterns to the original Brazilian versions), and other finishes.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} experimental investigations of composite sandwich plywood plates with cell type core and their connections between skin layers of birch plywood and {{a core of}} straight and <b>curved</b> <b>plywood</b> honeycomb-type ribs. This shape of core ribs provides several improvements for these plates in the manufacturing process as well as improves the mechanical properties of plywood plates. This specific form of ribs allows simplifying the manufacturing of these plates although it should be detailed and improved. The most typical cases (series of specimens) were compared to the results obtained from FEM (ANSYS) simulations. All thicknesses of elements are chosen according to plywood supplier assortment. Standard birch plywood (Riga Ply) plates were used - three layer plywood was chosen for skin elements (Surfaces) and three or five layer plywood was chosen for edge elements. Different bond pressures were taken to compare their influence on joint strength and stiffness...|$|E

This shape of core ribs provides several improvements for these plates in manufacturing process as well as mechanical properties. The influence of core element shapes on stiffness in longitudinal direction of a plate is insignificant although {{it is possible to}} vary with stiffness in transverse direction of these plates by changing form of plate’s ribs. The results are describable as specific strength or stiffness (stiffness to mass or strength to mass ratio etc.) in both directions. The various results depending on chosen variables (according to strength-stiffness criteria) plywood composite macrostructure is obtained for one span plate with uniformly distributed loading. The results show {{that it is possible to}} reduce material consumption causing reduction in stiffness but in general increasing stiffness to weight ratio for about 30 % or even more if it is possible to increase height of a plate more than maximum standard plywood plate. All thicknesses of elements are chosen according to plywood supplier assortment. A various thicknesses of plywood sheets (0 / 90 / 0 + 90 / 0 ·n) are taken for straight ribs as well as various plates coverings for waved part of ribs the 3 layer plywood was taken (90 / 0 / 90) or (0 / 90 / 0) due to simplification of manufacturing process.

40|$|The {{moisture}} sensitive {{materials are}} commonly used in load bearing or covering structures. One {{of the most popular}} material in this class of material is wood. Plywood is very common wood material. The plywood elements could be manufactured with symmetrical or unsymmetrical macro-structure with respect to mid-surface. The plywood sheet with unsymmetrical macro-structure obtains curved shape (negative Gaussian curvature) because of orthotropic moisture expansion properties of veneer. The unsymmetrical macro-structure could be used to create a new manufacturing technology (there could be used a standard manufacturing equipment that are used in manufacturing of flat plywood sheets) of <b>curved</b> <b>plywood</b> sheets. A several questions arise according to this kind of sheets. The environment moisture conditions are time dependent and therefore the shape of the sheet is also time-dependent. Significant residual stresses arise when the sheet is curved with moisture difference. The plywood viscous-elastic-plastic properties contribute the change of stress-deformation and shape. The behaviour of plywood sheet with unsymmetrical structure is numerically simulated. The simulation is done by solving coupled moisture diffusion, temperature conductive and stress-deformation problems. Deformations and displacements are large and therefore geometrically nonlinear problem are solved [1]. From a material constitutive model point of view, the material model presented in this paper is composed of five deformation mechanisms which provide an additive decomposition of strain into elastic response, hygroexpansion, viscoelastic creep, recoverable mechanosorption and mechanosorptive irrecoverable creep [2, 3, 4]. The moisture diffusion in transversal direction of plywood sheet is analyzed using Fick`s law [5]. Temperature conduction is analyzed by Fourier's law. The results of numerical simulation are verified by results of physical experiment. There are obtained the moisture diffusion coefficient in transversal direction of plywood by physical experiment. The results showed that the relaxation of residual stress produce a decrease of curvature of 3 -ply sheet more than 20 %. The moisture diffusion kinetics of plywood is different comparing to the same density wood...|$|E
