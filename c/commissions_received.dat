5000|$|Another major anticompetitive {{practice}} is supported (indirectly) by various state laws which prohibit the [...] "sharing" [...] of commissions with unlicensed individuals. In broad interpretations, this is deemed {{to prevent a}} buyers' agent from providing a credit {{to his or her}} buyers from <b>commissions</b> <b>received.</b> Currently, there are 10 states where real estate agents and brokers are barred from offering homebuyers or sellers cash rebates or gifts of any kind with a cash value more than $25. Various Realtors in such states have successfully contested this interpretation in states which now allow the practice (notably, Patrick Lea, a Realtor in Ohio, and numerous agents in Kentucky). The Kentucky case was ultimately tried with the United States Department of Justice as the plaintiff and the Kentucky Real Estate Commission as the defendant.|$|E
