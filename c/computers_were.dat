5|$|Avery Coonley {{began using}} {{computers}} for instruction in 1971 and offering computer programming to students {{as young as}} the fourth group in 1976. Desktop <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> brought into the classrooms to teach math, language arts, music, art, and computer programming, in 1978. Students begin learning basic keyboard and mouse skills in kindergarten and progress to multimedia presentations, data management, and software coding in the eighth group.|$|E
5|$|MU5 was {{designed}} to be about 20 times faster than Atlas, and was optimised for running compiled programs rather than hand-written machine code, something that contemporary <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> unable to do efficiently. A major factor in the MU5's much-improved performance over its predecessors was its incorporation of associative memory, which greatly speeded up access to its main store.|$|E

5|$|Revelations from {{software}} {{produced by}} Virgil Griffith in 2007 called WikiScanner made public {{the nature of}} edits on Wikipedia which were able to be traced directly back to Church of Scientology-controlled computers. CBS News and The Independent reported that edits by the Church of Scientology were made in attempts to remove criticism from the main article on the topic. The Times and Forbes noted that Scientologist <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> used to remove links between the Church of Scientology and a former anti-cult organization, since taken over by Scientology, the Cult Awareness Network. Der Spiegel reported that Wikiscanner revealed Scientology <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> used to promote Scientology's critical view of psychiatry, including adding links to the Scientology-founded Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) and to websites of other groups affiliated with Scientology.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} science, {{a zombie}} <b>computer</b> <b>is</b> a <b>computer</b> {{connected to the}} Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse {{and can be used}} to perform malicious tasks {{of one sort or another}} under remote direction. Botnets of zombie <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> often used to spread e-mail spam and launch denial-of-service attacks. Most owners of zombie <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> unaware that their system is being used in this way.

5|$|The Manchester <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> an {{innovative}} series of stored-program electronic computers {{developed during the}} 30-year period between 1947 and 1977 by a small team at the University of Manchester, {{under the leadership of}} Tom Kilburn. They included the world's first stored-program computer, the world's first transistorised computer, and what was the world's fastest computer {{at the time of its}} inauguration in 1962.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> the massive code {{breaking}} machines of the Second World War (such as Z3, ENIAC and Colossus). The latter {{two of these}} machines {{were based on the}} theoretical foundation laid by Alan Turing and developed by John von Neumann.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} {{construction of}} a von Neumann computer depended {{on the availability of}} a suitable memory device. The University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), the world's first stored-program computer, had successfully demonstrated the practicality of the stored-program approach and of the Williams tube, an early form of computer memory based on a standard cathode ray tube (CRT), by running its first program in June 1948. Early electronic <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> generally programmed by being rewired, or via plugs and patch panels; there was no separate program stored in memory, as in a modern computer. It could take several days to reprogram ENIAC, for instance. Stored-program <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> also being developed by other researchers, notably the National Physical Laboratory's Pilot ACE, Cambridge University's EDSAC, and the US Army's EDVAC. The SSEM and the Mark 1 differed primarily in their use of Williams tubes as memory devices, instead of mercury delay lines.|$|E
50|$|Embedded <b>{{computers}}</b> <b>are</b> <b>computers</b> that <b>are</b> {{a part of}} {{a machine}} or device. Embedded computers generally execute a program that is stored in non-volatile memory and is only intended to operate a specific machine or device. Embedded <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> very common. Embedded <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> typically required to operate continuously without being reset or rebooted, and once employed in their task the software usually cannot be modified. An automobile may contain a number of embedded computers; however, a washing machine and a DVD player would contain only one. The central processing units (CPUs) used in embedded <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> often sufficient only for the computational requirements of the specific application and may be slower and cheaper than CPUs found in a personal computer.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>computer</b> that <b>was</b> not serial (the first {{parallel}} <b>computer)</b> <b>was</b> the Whirlwind — 1951.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> {{recycled}} from redundant hardware {{donated by}} businesses and other organisations in the UK. Currently, {{nothing less than}} a Pentium IV specification is used. CFAS works in close collaboration with IT Schools Africa and the <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> refurbished by ITSA using volunteers who make sure that the <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> checked, parts are replaced if necessary and hard drives are wiped to UK Ministry of Defence standards. The majority of the <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> refurbished by prisoners in a range of prisons throughout England as part of rehabilitation training. Once in Africa, through agreement with Microsoft, Windows operating system and Office is installed.|$|R
5|$|Automonopoli was {{released}} by Automata UK in June 1983, selling for £6 (£ as of 2015) Written primarily in BASIC, it modelled the board game Monopoly in every detail of gameplay. Although other versions of Monopoly for home <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> already in circulation for play between human players, {{at the time of}} its release Automonopoli was marketed as the first version of the game with an artificial intelligence advanced enough for the computer to play against human players.|$|E
5|$|Kilburn {{anticipated}} {{a return}} to Malvern but Williams persuaded him to stay {{to work on the}} university's collaborative project developing the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercial computer. Max Newman withdrew from the project, believing that the development of computers required engineers and not mathematicians at this point, but Williams preferred to return to electrotechnics, leaving Kilburn in charge. He was assisted by Alan Turing, who arrived at Manchester in 1948. The Mark I incorporated innovations such as index registers, and combined CRTs with magnetic drum storage. Nine Mark I <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> sold by between 1951 and 1957.|$|E
5|$|Lyricist Howard Ashman first {{pitched the}} idea, and the {{screenplay}} went through three drafts before then-Disney Studios president Jeffrey Katzenberg agreed to its production. The animators based their designs {{on the work}} of caricaturist Al Hirschfeld, and <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> used for both finishing the artwork and creating some animated elements. The musical score was written by Alan Menken and features six songs with lyrics written by both Ashman and Tim Rice, who took over after Ashman's death.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, one {{improvement}} to Zeus {{was already}} being studied: a new phased-array radar replacing Zeus' mechanical ones would greatly {{increase the number}} of targets and interceptors that a single site could handle. Much more powerful <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> needed to match this performance. Additionally, the antennas were mounted directly in concrete and would have increased blast resistance. Initial studies at Bell Labs started in 1960 on what was then known as the Zeus Multi-function Array Radar, or ZMAR. In June 1961, Western Electric and Sylvania were selected to build a prototype, with Sperry Rand Univac providing the control computer.|$|E
5|$|Most importantly, the High Speed Photometer was {{replaced}} with the COSTAR corrective optics package, and WFPC {{was replaced}} with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) with an internal optical correction system. The solar arrays and their drive electronics were also replaced, as well as four gyroscopes in the telescope pointing system, two electrical control units and other electrical components, and two magnetometers. The onboard <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> upgraded with added coprocessors, and Hubble's orbit was boosted.|$|E
5|$|The ARC {{became the}} driving force behind the design and {{development}} of the oN-Line System (NLS). He and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface. He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems.|$|E
50|$|E-Hubs <b>are</b> {{groups of}} <b>computers,</b> usually 2 to 10, installed, networked, {{connected}} to the internet by NCCP at community locations.

All of the <b>computers</b> <b>are</b> loaded with legitimate Microsoft software, and in some cases, the cost of the <b>computers</b> <b>is</b> covered by North Coast Technical and Further Education (TAFE) financing as part of a TAFE course.|$|R
50|$|To {{intensify the}} {{academic}} programs, a <b>Computer</b> Laboratory <b>was</b> installed in 1988 and <b>computer</b> subjects <b>were</b> offered in all courses.

5|$|From December 12, 1994, to January 2000, the PGSO did not hire any new deputies or {{civilian}} employees, {{leaving the}} agency with 92 vacant positions {{that needed to}} be filled. Over that period, 66 deputies left the agency, some retiring routinely, others leaving due to increased workloads caused by vacant positions. In some cases, deputies worked sixteen hours in one day, eight in courtrooms, and eight serving warrants. In December 1994, the agency had 248 deputies, whereas on January 20, 2000, it only had 192 deputies, with 20 leaving from November 1998 to January 2000. In July 1996, the county government decreased the amount of funding the PGSO was receiving. Unlike the PGPD at the time, the PGSO was not nationally accredited and still is not, as of January 2015. <b>Computers</b> <b>were</b> also in short supply, and the few that were in use were outdated and obsolete.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Norbert Wiener {{approached}} Bush with {{a proposal}} to build a digital computer. Bush declined to provide NDRC funding for it {{on the grounds that}} he did not believe that it could be completed {{before the end of the}} war. The supporters of digital <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> disappointed at the decision, which they attributed to a preference for outmoded analog technology. In June 1943, the Army provided $500,000 to build the computer, which became ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer. Having delayed its funding, Bush's prediction proved correct as ENIAC was not completed until December 1945, after the war had ended. His critics saw his attitude as a failure of vision.|$|E
5|$|Mainframe {{computers}} are computers used primarily by businesses and academic institutions for large-scale processes. Before personal computers, first termed microcomputers, became widely {{available to the}} general public in the 1970s, the computing industry was composed of mainframe computers and the relatively smaller and cheaper minicomputer variant. During the mid to late 1960s, many early video games were programmed on these computers. Developed prior to the rise of the commercial video game industry in the early 1970s, these early mainframe games were generally written by students or employees at large corporations in a machine or assembly language that could only be understood by the specific machine or computer type they were developed on. While many of these games were lost as older <b>computers</b> <b>were</b> discontinued, some of them were ported to high-level computer languages like BASIC, had expanded versions later released for personal computers, or were recreated for bulletin board systems years later, thus influencing future games and developers.|$|E
