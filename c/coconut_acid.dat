Feed intake and body weight were reduced by 14 to 17 % during consumption of experimental diets compared with an unsupplemented starter diet. Following skip-a-day feeding during the growing period, body weights were not different at 140 days of age in each experiment. In Experiment 1, higher egg production (hen-housed %) was associated with glycine-induced restriction of intake of starter diet, {{but there was no}} difference in egg weight. The difference was attributable, in part, to reduced mortality during the early laying period. In Experiment 2, no differences were observed in egg production, grams feed per egg, or egg weight due to glycine- or CFA-induced restriction from 1 to 21 days followed by quantitative restriction.

The separation and isolation gave the following coconut protein preparations: coconut milk, coconut skim milk, insoluble solids, acid precipitate, and acid-heat precipitate. Trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA) of the coconut protein preparations was relatively low while tryptic digestibility of the isolated proteins was considerably lower than those of the coconut milk and skim milk, the digestibility of coconut protein preparations was lower than that of casein. In general, the emulsifying and farming properties of coconut protein preparations were lower than casein. The insoluble solids showed the highest viscosity when compared with the coconut protein preparations. In contrast to the whey protein concentrate (WPC), the apparent strain of gels from the acid precipitate increased as the pH increased. The gelation properties at pH 3 of the insoluble solids were better than WPC. The estimated molecular weight by size-exclusion chromatography of coconut protein preparations gave 3 fractions with MW ranging from 6850 Da to 229402 Da.

40|$|Background The {{increased}} demand for fish protein {{has led to the}} intensification of aquaculture practices which are hampered by nutritional and health factors affecting growth performance. To solve these problems, antibiotics have been used for many years in the prevention, control and treatment against disease as well as growth promoters to improve animal performance. Nowadays, the use of antibiotics in the European Union and other countries has been completely or partially banned {{as a result of the}} existence of antibiotic cross-resistance. Therefore, a number of alternatives, including enzymes, prebiotics, probiotics, phytonutrients and organic acids used alone or in combination have been proposed for the improvement of immunological state, growth performance and production in livestock animals. The aim of the present study was to evaluate two commercially available feed additives, one based on medium-chain fatty <b>acids</b> (MCFAs) from <b>coconut</b> oil and another with a Bacillus-based probiotic, in gilthead sea bream (GSB, Sparus aurata), a marine farmed fish of high value in the Mediterranean aquaculture. Methods The potential benefits of adding two commercial feed additives on fish growth performance and intestinal health were assessed in a 100 -days feeding trial. The experimental diets (D 2 and D 3) were prepared by supplementing a basal diet (D 1) with MCFAs in the form of a sodium salt of <b>coconut</b> fatty <b>acid</b> distillate (DICOSAN®; Norel, Madrid, Spain), rich on C- 12, added at 0. 3 % (D 2) or with the probiotic Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940, added at 0. 1 % (D 3). The study integrated data on growth performance, blood biochemistry, histology and intestinal gene expression patterns of selected markers of intestinal function and architecture. Results MCFAs in the form of a coconut oil increased feed intake, growth rates and the surface of nutrient absorption, promoting the anabolic action of the somatotropic axis. The probiotic (D 3) induced anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects with changes in circulating cortisol, immunoglobulin M, leukocyte respiratory burst, and mucosal expression levels of cytokines, lymphocyte markers and immunoglobulin T. Discussion MCFA supplementation showed positive effects on GSB growth and intestinal architecture acting mainly in the anterior intestine, where absorption takes place. The probiotic B. amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 exhibited key effects in the regulation of the immune status inducing anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects which can be potentially advantageous upon infection or exposure to other stressors.

This {{study was}} performed to investigate the effect of surfomer on cholesterol synthesis and low density lipoprotein in hamsters fed a hypercholesterolaemic, lipid-enriched diet. Animals and methods. Male hamsters were fed a diet enriched in cholesterol (0. 07 %) and saturated fatty <b>acids</b> (<b>coconut</b> oil 20 %); the diet was supplemented with 3 % surfomer: for 1 - 4 weeks. Cholesterol synthesis was assessed measuring incorporation of [H- 3]water into tissue sterols; low density lipoprotein clearance was determined using a primed-continuous infusion of [I- 125]tyramine-cellobiose lipoprotein. Results. Cholesterol synthesis was suppressed after 3 weeks of hyperlipidaemic diet in liver and small bowel (by 88 % and 38 %, respectively) and was significantly increased by supplementing the fat-enriched diet with surfomer. Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol was increased by 44 % after 4 weeks of hyperlipidaemic diet, in parallel with a decrease in hepatic low density lipoprotein clearance rates (48 +/- 3 vs 68 +/- 7 mul of plasma/h per g of tissue). Concurrent treatment with surfomer for 1, P or 4 weeks prevented the decrease of clearance and maintained normal low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels at all time points, Conclusions. Surfomer represents a powerful tool to investigate the impact of cholesterol absorption on sterol homeostasis. Furthermore, since surfomer appears to normalize low density lipoprotein transport in hamsters fed a diet comparable to a lipid-rich western-style regimen, this drug may deserve consideration as an adjunct treatment for hypercholesterolaemia in selected patient groups...|$|R
40|$|Coconut, Cocos nucifera L., is a {{tree that}} is {{cultivated}} to provide {{a large number of}} products, although it is mainly grown for its nutritional and medicinal values.

MCFA are unique in that they are easily absorbed and metabolised by the liver, and can be converted to ketones.

Casein-based, semi-purified diets containing 15 % fish oil or 14 % hydrogenated <b>coconut</b> oil/oleic <b>acid</b> (1 : 1) supplemented with 1 % 20 : 4 n− 6, 1 % 22 : 6 n− 3 or 1 % of various combinations of these two acids were fed to duplicate groups of 26 juvenile turbot for 11 weeks. In this trial, feeding the diet containing 20 : 4 n− 6 as the only highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) resulted in higher growth and survival than any of the mixtures of the two fatty acids or 22 : 6 n− 3 alone. The diet containing 22 : 6 n− 3 as the sole HUFA resulted in the lowest growth and survival of all dietary treatments. The control diet with 15 % fish oil resulted in a greater growth rate than any of the pure HUFA-supplemented diets. There was a significant effect of dietary lipid on the somatic index of the brain but not heart, kidney or liver. The percentage of lipid in the liver, but not of heart, brain, eyes, gills or kidney, was influenced by dietary lipid, with the highest percentage in fish supplemented with DHA alone. After 11 weeks, the 20 : 4 n− 6 and 22 : 6 n− 3 levels in whole-body total lipids were strongly influenced by the content of these fatty acids in the diets. The relative effect of dietary levels of these two fatty acids on their content in fish lipids varied considerably among the various organs and tissues of the fish that were analyzed. Brain and eye lipids were generally highest in 22 : 6 n− 3 while gill and kidney lipids were consistently higher in 20 : 4 n− 6 than the other organs analyzed. The effect of dietary 20 : 4 n− 6 on the content of that HUFA in organ lipid was greatest in gill and liver. The greatest impact of dietary 22 : 6 n− 3 level on content of that acid in organ lipid was seen in gill and kidney. There were also significant effects of dietary HUFA content on organ lipid levels of saturated, mono-unsaturated fatty acids and other members of the n− 3 and n− 6 PUFA, and HUFA series. The present study suggests that the EFA growth-promoting activity of arachidonic acid provides strong support for the contention that dietary 20 : 4 n− 6 is essential for juvenile turbot...|$|R

Tributyrin was not utilized well for the growth of these species yet the enzyme produced in the presence of glucose and other triglycerides hydrolysed it at the highest rate and the order of activity was followed by those against the glycerides of <b>coconut</b> oil, oleic <b>acid</b> and erucic acid in decreasing order. Oleic and erucic acid glycerides affected greater induction of lipase in all the Rhizopus species as compared to <b>coconut</b> oil. Oleic <b>acid</b> and erucic acid glycerides in general caused greater inhibition of the enzyme as well, as compared to the glycerides of coconut oil. The lipase produced in the presence of particular triglycerides neither show preferential activity against the same triglycerides nor the enzyme was inhibited preferentially by these. In case of the various Mucor species it was observed that when glucose was replaced by olive, coconut mustard oil in the growth medium there was increase in lipase activities both in the mycelia and the broth in all oases. Olive oil was found to cause greater lipase induction as compared to coconut and mustard oils. The enzyme produced by these species was not specifically active against the triglycerides in the presence of which it was produced. Irrespective of the triglycerides used as a carbon source the lipase produced hydrolysed coconut oil at a greater rate and this activity was followed by those against olive and mustard oils. Optimum pH at which maximum hydrolysis took place was determined to be 7. 0 when all these species were produced in the medium containing glucose as the corbon*****. When M. hiemalis was grown in the medium containing olive oil instead of glucose the optimum pH for lipase activity remained the same. M. hiemalis being the best producer of lipase among the various Mucor species was studied in detail. Initial pH Of the fermentation medium at which M. hiemalis produced maximum lipase was 4. o. Addition of Ca++ to the medium did not increase lipase production. Optimum pH for hydrolysis for both the mycelial and the extracellular lipases was found to be 7. 0. The fungus produced significant amount of lipase in the presence of glucose. However, the lipase activity increased markedly when olive oil was added to the medium at the beginning of fermentation. Addition of alive oil at a later stage did not induce the enzyme as much. Studies with washed mycelia showed that greater amount of lipase was released in the presence of olive oil. Olive oil and mustard oil products inhibited the lipase more than those of coconut oil the lipase induced by a particular type of triglycerides did not specifically hydrolyse the same triglyceride nor was it inhibited specifically. The mycelial growth, extracellu 1 ar and cell-bound lipase production and lipid formation within the cells of M. hiemalis were observed to be associated with glucose utilization. Most of the glucose was used {{towards the end of the}} growth phase when the mycelia showed maximal lipase activity (17 U/g dry mycelia) as well as maximal lipid content (13. 4 mg/g dry mycelia). Maximal broth lipase activity (76 U/ 100 ml) was observed after the cell lysis had started. The fractions identified in the mycelial lipid extracts were sterol esters, triglycerides, fatty acids, diglycerides, sterols, monoglycerides, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl serine and an unknown polar lipid. The proportion between the neutral and the polar lipids was only 0. 06 at 44 hours, increasing gradually to 1. 51 at 164 hours of fermentation. Effect of adding triglycerides on the growth of Mucor hiemalis and production of lipase and the mycelial lipids was studied as well. A concentration of 1...|$|R
