40|$|V. vinifera L. cv. “Siyah Gemre” is an {{important}} table grape variety of Mediterranean Region in Turkey. It is late sea- son, medium bunch density, round berry, red-black colored and seeded. The study was carried out to make clone selection for increasing the yield and quality in “Siyah Gemre” grape variety The project was completed in two stages. First one was selection nominees of <b>mother</b> <b>clone</b> <b>vine</b> and second was establishing of clonal collection vineyard. The first stage {{studies were carried out}} at grower vineyards of İsparta, Turkey surroundings where “Siyah Gemre” is grown wide spread, between 2001 and 2003. Clonal nominees were selected by using counting the cluster and shoot {{at the end of the}} project. After that, the clonal collection vineyard was established with spacing 3. 0 m × 1. 65 m in 2004. Twelve vines of each clonal nominees were grafted onto 110 R rootstock. In the study the values of yield, number of cluster, weight of cluster, 100 berry weight, index of maturity, sensory analysis, weight of pruning and bud productivity were evaluated between 2007 – 2012. At the end of this study, according to the values of total point, five clone nominees were selected and among their 3, 19, 24 numbered clones were chosen in terms of total sensory analysis score, yield and stability, cluster and berry properties respectively...|$|R

2500|$|In viticulture, growers want {{to avoid}} {{any part of the}} cordon from {{touching}} the ground because of the vine's natural inclination to send out suckers or basal shoots and take root in that area where the cordon is touching the ground. Ever since the phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century, many vines are grafted on phylloxera resistant rootstock. However, the [...] "top part" [...] of the grafted vine is still very susceptible to the phylloxera and should a part of that vine take root both the daughter and the original <b>mother</b> <b>vine</b> will risk being infected by the louse. Additionally this daughter vine will leech resources of water and nutrients from the <b>mother</b> <b>vine</b> which can diminish the quality of both vines' grape production.|$|R
50|$|Cuttings - This {{involves}} a shoot {{taken from a}} <b>mother</b> <b>vine</b> and then planted where the shoot will eventually sprout a root system and regenerate itself into a full-fledged vine with trunk and canopy. Often new cuttings will be first planted in a nursery where it is allowed to develop for a couple years before being planted in the vineyard.|$|R

5000|$|Each cutting, {{taken from}} a <b>mother</b> <b>vine,</b> is a <b>clone</b> of that vine. The way that a vine grower selects these {{cuttings}} {{can be described as}} either clonal or massal selection. In clonal selection, an ideal plant within a vineyard or nursery that has exhibited the most desirable traits is selected with all cuttings taken from that single plant. In massal (or [...] "mass") selection, cuttings are taken from several vines of the same variety that have collectively demonstrated desirable traits.|$|R

Though its exact relationship {{has not yet been}} determined by DNA analysis, ampelographers believe that the grape variety is closely related to the Hunnic grape Gouais blanc which is notable for being the <b>mother</b> <b>vine</b> to several grape varieties including Chardonnay and Gamay. There also might be a relationship between Gueuche noir and the Jura wine grape Enfariné noir.|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{similarities}} in synonyms to the Beaujolais wine grape Gamay, DNA evidence has confirmed {{that there is}} no direct relationship between the two grape varieties. However, testing completed in 2009 did show a potential parent-offspring relationship between Abouriou and Magdeleine Noire des Charentes though it is not yet clear which vine is the parent and which is the offspring. As Magdeleine Noire des Charentes has been confirmed as the <b>mother</b> <b>vine</b> to the notable international varieties Malbec and Merlot this means that Abouriou is either a half-sibling or grandparent to those varieties.|$|R

40|$|In Australia, trunk {{diseases}} of grapevines {{are becoming increasingly}} important. Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum causes black goo decline and is very common in newly planted vineyards in which establishment is slow and uneven. It is apparently introduced to these vineyards as infections of the propagating material. We have isolated the fungus many times from rootstock <b>mother</b> <b>vines</b> and speculate that it spreads from {{the trunk of the}} <b>mother</b> <b>vine</b> to the canes which are later harvested as cuttings. Histological studies of inoculated vine shoots in tissue culture, show that the fungus infects the xylem parenchyma cells as intracellular hyphae, and these cells produce tyloses in the adjacent xylem vessels. The hyphae also penetrate the vessels, often by way of the tyloses. Brown deposits (black goo) are seen in vessels and cells, often some distance from active hyphae. Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum has also been found to produce pycnidia on the surfaces of infected wood when moist incubated. The same pycnidia were also found on the surfaces of inoculated tissue culture vines, proving that they are pycnidia of P. chlamydosporum. The spores produced by the pycnidia appear to be conidial rather than spermatial as they germinate readily on agar and develop normal colonies. Esca was formally diagnosed {{for the first time in}} Australia in 1999, although it is believed to have been present for many years. In addition to Phellinus (Fomitiporia) punctatus, we have also found a second species of Phellinus associated with similar symptoms. This species differs from P. punctatus in the production of setae on host tissue and in culture. Like P. punctatus it has a close association with Phaeoacremonium chlamydosporum. Eutypa dieback appears to be increasing in severity in Australian vineyards and may be a major limiting factor in the sustainability of Australian wine production. A national trunk disease project has commenced to develop management strategies for black goo decline, esca, Eutypa dieback and other trunk diseases...|$|R

40|$|Species of Cylindrocladiella {{occur on}} a variety of hosts, where they are known to act as {{pathogens}} or saprobes. Eight species from this genus are currently recognised, of which five have been reported previously in South Africa: C. camelliae, C. elegans, C. lageniformis, C. parva and C. peruviana. Isolates of Cylindrocladiella were obtained from a newly established 99 -Richter grapevine <b>mother</b> <b>vine</b> block exhibiting decline symptoms. The DNA phylogeny of these and additional isolates, also obtained from declining grapevines, was determined by sequencing the ITS (ITS 1, ITS 2 and 5. 8 S) as well as ß-tubulin and histone H 3 gene regions. This identified four species of Cylindrocladiella on grapevines in South Africa: C. lageniformis, C. parva, C. peruviana and a new species described here as C. viticola, which forms part of the C. infestans species complex. Pathogenicity trials, using stem inoculations on green and 1 -year-old 99 -Richter cuttings to determine the pathogenicity of selected isolates of these species, gave inconclusive result...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of two heterozygous and one homozygous clones of the Israeli Dor- 70 line of com- mon carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) {{was tested using}} DNA fingerprinting (DFP) and mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) analysis. The clones were obtained in large-scale production from mitotic gyno- genetic females and males (sex-inversed). MLR {{analysis was used to}} examine major histocom- patibility complex (MHC) antigens in individuals. DFP provided evidence concerning identity in the whole genome. Both methods showed that individuals within a progeny were identical, confirming genetic uniformity within each clone and showing that no paternal DNA was transmitted during mitotic and meiotic gynogenesis. The results indicated that uniformity of DFP in progeny of the homozygous clone is obtained only when the mother is fully homozygous, and in the heterozygous clone only if both parents are fully homozygous. The results of both methods provide evidence, though indirect, that the mitotic gynogenetic parents of these fish (mother of the homozygous <b>clone,</b> <b>mother</b> and father of the heterozygous clones) were fully homozygous...|$|R
