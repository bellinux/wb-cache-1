5000|$|Split shot: {{a larger}} type of lead shot where each pellet is cut part-way through the diameter. These type of shot were {{formerly}} commonly {{used as a}} line weight in angling. They are no longer solely manufactured from lead but instead are often made from softer materials {{that can be easily}} pressed onto the fishing line instead of being closed in a <b>crimp</b> using <b>pliers</b> as was once common.|$|R
50|$|Detonator <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers,</b> cap <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers</b> or {{detonator}} crimping tool {{is a common}} tool when working with explosives. The construction {{is very similar to}} the construction of any other multi-tool or pliers. The specific feature is the presence of one groove on each of the opposing jaws. When the jaws are open, the groves will appear as a semi circle with an elliptical extension. When fully closed the two grooves will form a cylindrical shape.|$|E
50|$|They fulfill {{numerous}} uses, including {{allowing the}} wires {{to be easily}} terminated to screw terminals, fast-on / quick-disconnect / spade-foot type terminals, wire splices, or various combinations of these. A tube-shaped connector with two crimps for splicing wires in-line is called a butt splice connector. Crimp-on connectors are attached by inserting the stripped end of a stranded wire into {{a portion of the}} connector, which is then mechanically deformed / compressed (crimped) tightly around the wire. The crimping is accomplished with special <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers.</b> A key idea behind crimped connectors is that the finished connection is gas-tight.|$|E
50|$|The {{rear part}} of a {{detonator}} is usually made of a rigid but malleable aluminium alloy, sometimes supported by a relatively soft brass or copper structure to aid in reliably giving a strong and watertight seal without damaging the initiation source. A pair of detonator <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers</b> mate the detonator with the initiation source by allowing the detonator's back end to be inserted into the large hole present when the pliers is in the non-compressed position. When force is applied, the jaws will move closer to each other crimping {{the neck of the}} detonator. This shows that the function is just a simple crimping tool, adapted for one specific item.|$|E
50|$|Plastic {{spiral binding}} is a three-step process: punch, insert, crimp. First, a punch creates holes {{along the edge}} of the document. Second, a coil {{inserter}} spins the coils through the holes. Third, a pair of coil <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers</b> or a crimping machine is used to cut off the excess coil and crimp the end to prevent the coil from coming loose from the document. There are also more automated systems that will insert and cut and crimp the coil in one process and even some fully automated systems that will punch, insert, and crimp for the very high volume users. Light volume or personal users may choose to buy a single machine that does all of these features or may even choose to spin the coils onto their books by hand. Higher volume users will often choose to separate these three functions to help increase productivity.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} development of compact and efficient tools {{which can be used}} by a 4 -DOF robot during an automated process aimed at the building of heating coils. Resistive wires must be cut and crimped into small connectors at a fast pace, with extreme repeatability and reliability. We designed two special tools for the end effector of a parallel-kinematic robotic device, exploiting a compact and lightweight design. Wire cutting has been obtained by means of two custom blades. A test bed has been build in order to investigate the optimal shape of the blades, hence minimizing the actuating force and wear effects. A new cutting method has been proposed and a final cutting tool has been designed and mounted on the robot. Crimping the resistive wire into miniaturized connectors required {{the development of}} small, yet stiff, pneumatic <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers.</b> The cutting tool and the <b>crimping</b> <b>pliers</b> have been mounted on a single multifunctional end-effector. The robot successfully performed the high-speed tests, showing the high performance of the tools...|$|E
