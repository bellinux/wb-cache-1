25|$|For {{biochemistry}} samples, {{blood is}} usually <b>centrifuged</b> and serum is separated. If the serum {{needs to go}} {{on more than one}} machine, it can be divided into separate tubes.|$|E
25|$|Pooled {{whole-blood}} platelets, {{sometimes called}} “random” platelets, {{are separated by}} one of two methods. In the US, a unit of whole blood is placed into a large centrifuge in what {{is referred to as}} a “soft spin.” At these settings, the platelets remain suspended in the plasma. The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is removed from the red cells, then <b>centrifuged</b> at a faster setting to harvest the platelets from the plasma. In other regions of the world, the unit of whole blood is <b>centrifuged</b> using settings that cause the platelets to become suspended in the “buffy coat” layer, which includes the platelets and the white blood cells. The “buffy coat” is isolated in a sterile bag, suspended in a small amount of red blood cells and plasma, then <b>centrifuged</b> again to separate the platelets and plasma from the red and white blood cells. Regardless of the initial method of preparation, multiple donations may be combined into one container using a sterile connection device to manufacture a single product with the desired therapeutic dose.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{is drawn}} into a test tube {{containing}} liquid sodium citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then <b>centrifuged</b> to separate blood cells from plasma (as prothrombin time is most commonly measured using blood plasma). In newborns, a capillary whole blood specimen is used.|$|E
50|$|Both the conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> and chamber bowl <b>centrifuge</b> can be {{used for}} liquid/liquid and solid/liquid separation. However, the {{advantage}} of conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> over chamber bowl <b>centrifuge</b> is that solid discharge is possible in conical plate. The chamber bowl has a high capacity for solids but there is no solid discharge.Bowl cooling is possible for both conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> and chamber bowl <b>centrifuge.</b> However, cleaning is easier as well as better sludge dewatering in chamber bowl <b>centrifuge</b> as compared to conical plate <b>centrifuge.</b>|$|R
50|$|For ten years, Iran {{will place}} over {{two-thirds of its}} <b>centrifuges</b> in storage, from its current {{stockpile}} of 19,000 <b>centrifuges</b> (of which 10,000 were operational) {{to no more than}} 6,104 operational <b>centrifuges,</b> with only 5,060 allowed to enrich uranium, with the enrichment capacity being limited to the Natanz plant. The <b>centrifuges</b> there must be IR-1 <b>centrifuges,</b> the first-generation <b>centrifuge</b> type which is Iran's oldest and least efficient; Iran will give up its advanced IR-2M <b>centrifuges</b> in this period. The non-operating <b>centrifuges</b> will be stored in Natanz and monitored by IAEA, but may be used to replace failed <b>centrifuges.</b> Iran will not build any new uranium-enrichment facilities for fifteen years.|$|R
50|$|Both conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> and tubular bowl <b>centrifuge</b> can be {{used for}} liquid/liquid and solid/liquid separation. However, the {{advantage}} of conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> over tubular bowl <b>centrifuge</b> is that solid discharge is possible in conical plate but recovery of solids in tubular bowl is difficult and there is limited solid capacity. As the liquid discharge in conical plate <b>centrifuge</b> is under high pressure, this eliminates foaming but foaming is present in tubular bowl <b>centrifuges</b> unless special skimming or centripetal pumps are used. Tubular bowl <b>centrifuges</b> are easier to clean and good sludge dewatering as compared to conical plate <b>centrifuge.</b>|$|R
25|$|Chip {{handling}} and coolant management are interrelated. Over the decades {{they have been}} improved, {{to the point that}} many metalworking operations now use engineered solutions for the overall cycle of collecting, separating, and recycling both chips and coolant. For example, the chips are graded by size and type, tramp metals (such as bolts and scrap parts) are separated out, the coolant is <b>centrifuged</b> off the chips (which are then dried for further handling), and so on.|$|E
25|$|The {{additives}} {{may include}} anticoagulants (EDTA, sodium citrate, heparin) or a gel with density between those of blood cells and blood plasma. Additionally, some tubes contain additives that preserve certain components of or substances within the blood, such as glucose. When a tube is <b>centrifuged,</b> the materials within {{are separated by}} density, with the blood cells sinking {{to the bottom and}} the plasma or serum accumulating at the top. Tubes containing gel can be easily handled and transported after centrifugation without the blood cells and serum mixing.|$|E
25|$|Cells from bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, cord blood, tumor, and tissues (including skin, {{umbilical}} cord, chorionic villi, liver, {{and many}} other organs) can be cultured using standard cell culture techniques {{in order to increase}} their number. A mitotic inhibitor (colchicine, colcemid) is then added to the culture. This stops cell division at mitosis which allows an increased yield of mitotic cells for analysis. The cells are then <b>centrifuged</b> and media and mitotic inhibitor are removed, and replaced with a hypotonic solution. This causes the white blood cells or fibroblasts to swell so that the chromosomes will spread when added to a slide as well as lyses the red blood cells. After the cells have been allowed to sit in hypotonic solution, Carnoy's fixative (3:1 methanol to glacial acetic acid) is added. This kills the cells and hardens the nuclei of the remaining white blood cells. The cells are generally fixed repeatedly to remove any debris or remaining red blood cells. The cell suspension is then dropped onto specimen slides. After aging the slides in an oven or waiting a few days they are ready for banding and analysis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Reticulated porous {{ceramics}} (RPCs) with uniform structure were fabricated by a two-step <b>centrifuging</b> process.

50|$|In practice, several such <b>centrifuges</b> are {{connected}} in series. Each <b>centrifuge</b> receives one input and produces two output lines, corresponding to light and heavy fractions. The input of each <b>centrifuge</b> is the output (light) {{of the previous}} <b>centrifuge</b> and the output (heavy) of the following stage. This produces an almost pure light fraction from the output (light) of the last <b>centrifuge</b> and an almost pure heavy fraction from the output (heavy) of the first <b>centrifuge.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Sugar {{refining}} further purifies the raw sugar. It {{is first}} mixed with heavy syrup and then <b>centrifuged</b> {{in a process}} called [...] "affination". Its purpose is to wash away the sugar crystals' outer coating, which is less pure than the crystal interior. The remaining sugar is then dissolved to make a syrup, about 60 percent solids by weight.|$|E

RT-PCR is set up for selected RNA expression. Specifically, hPL and beta-hCG mRNA is stable in maternal blood (Ng et al. 2002). This can help to confirm the presence of fetal DNA in the maternal plasma.|$|E
2500|$|Non-compacted {{particles}} remain {{mostly in}} the liquid called [...] "supernatant" [...] and can {{be removed from the}} vessel thereby separating the supernatant from the pellet. [...] The rate of centrifugation is determined by the angular acceleration applied to the sample, typically measured in comparison to the g. [...] If samples are <b>centrifuged</b> long enough, the particles in the vessel will reach equilibrium wherein the particles accumulate specifically at a point in the vessel where their buoyant density is balanced with centrifugal force. [...] Such an [...] "equilibrium" [...] centrifugation can allow extensive purification of a given particle.|$|E

2500|$|The {{centrifugal}} {{refinement of}} the liposuction-harvested adipocyte tissues removes blood products and free lipids to produce autologous breast filler. The injectable filler-fat is obtained by centrifuging (spinning) the fat-filled syringes for {{sufficient time to}} allow the serum, blood, and oil (liquid fat) components to collect, by density, apart from the refined, injection-quality fat. To refine the fat for facial injection quality, the fat-filled syringes are <b>centrifuged</b> for 1.0 minute at 2,000 RPM, which separates the unnecessary solution, leaving refined filler-fat. Moreover, centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 10 minutes produces a [...] "collagen graft"; the histologic composition of which is cell residues, collagen fibres, and 5.0 per cent intact fat cells. Furthermore, because the patient's body naturally absorbs some of the fat grafts, the breasts maintain their contours and volumes for 18–24 months.|$|E
2500|$|A {{complete}} screen (blood culture, sputum culture, urine culture, throat swab, {{and culture}} of any aspirated pus) should be performed on all patients with suspected melioidosis (culture on blood agar as well as Ashdown's medium). A definitive diagnosis is made by growing B. pseudomallei from any site. [...] A throat swab is not sensitive, but is 100% specific if positive, and compares favourably with sputum culture. [...] The sensitivity of urine culture is increased if a <b>centrifuged</b> specimen is cultured, and any bacterial growth should be reported (not just growth above 104 organisms/ml which is the usual cutoff). [...] Very occasionally, bone marrow culture may be positive in patients who have negative blood cultures for B.pseudomallei, {{but these are not}} usually recommended. [...] A common error made by clinicians unfamiliar with melioidosis is to send a specimen from only the affected site (which is the usual procedure for most other infections) instead of sending a full screen.|$|E

50|$|A {{solid bowl}} <b>centrifuge</b> {{is a type}} of <b>centrifuge</b> that uses the {{principle}} of sedimentation. A <b>centrifuge</b> is used to separate a mixture that consists of two substances with different densities by using the centrifugal force resulting from continuous rotation. It is normally used to separate solid-liquid, liquid-liquid, and solid-solid mixtures. Solid bowl <b>centrifuges</b> are widely used in various industrial applications, such as wastewater treatment, coal manufacturing, and polymer manufacturing. One advantage of solid bowl <b>centrifuges</b> for industrial uses is the simplicity of installation compared to other types of <b>centrifuge.</b> There are three design types of solid bowl <b>centrifuge,</b> which are conical, cylindrical, and conical-cylindrical.|$|R

50|$|Natural brown sugar, {{raw sugar}} or whole cane sugar are sugars that retain a small to {{large amount of}} the {{molasses}} from the mother liquor (the partially evaporated sugar cane juice). Based upon weight, brown cane sugar when fully refined yields up to 70% white sugar, the degree {{depending on how much}} molasses remained in the sugar crystals, which in turn is dependent upon whether the brown sugar was <b>centrifuged</b> or not. As there is more molasses in natural brown sugar, it contains minor nutritional value and mineral content. Some natural brown sugars have particular names and characteristics, and are sold as turbinado, demerara or raw sugar if they have been <b>centrifuged</b> to a large degree. Brown sugars that have been only mildly <b>centrifuged</b> or unrefined (non-centrifuged) retain a much higher degree of molasses and are called various names across the globe according to their country of origin: e.g. panela, rapadura, jaggery, muscovado, piloncillo, etc.|$|E

5000|$|The gas {{centrifugation}} process utilizes a unique design that allows gas to constantly flow {{in and out}} of the <b>centrifuge.</b> Unlike most <b>centrifuges</b> which rely on batch processing, the gas <b>centrifuge</b> utilizes continuous processing, allowing cascading, in which multiple identical processes occur in succession.The gas <b>centrifuge</b> consists of a cylindrical rotor, a casing, an electric motor, and three lines for material to travel. The gas <b>centrifuge</b> is designed with a casing that completely encloses the <b>centrifuge.</b> The cylindrical rotor is located inside the casing, which is evacuated of all air to produce a near frictionless rotation when operating. The motor spins the rotor, creating the centripetal force on the components as they enter the cylindrical rotor. There are two output lines, one located at the top of the <b>centrifuge</b> and the other located at the bottom.
