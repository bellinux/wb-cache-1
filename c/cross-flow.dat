25|$|In July 1976, Ford {{introduced}} the XC Falcon, {{which was the}} first model to comply with the new pollution regulations specified under Australian Design Rule 27A. This led to locally produced Cleveland V8s and the introduction of the <b>cross-flow</b> (also called the X-flow) six-cylinder. Versions of this engine were produced in North America and, in various guises, used in Australian Falcons through to the XF. Its long stroke and large capacity made for very good 'towing' torque, while its thick castings and relatively loose tolerances gave it a reputation for reliability in spite of abuse.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} primary classifications of heat {{exchangers}} {{according to their}} flow arrangement. In parallel-flow heat exchangers, the two fluids enter the exchanger at the same end, and travel in {{parallel to one another}} to the other side. In counter-flow heat exchangers the fluids enter the exchanger from opposite ends. The counter current design is the most efficient, in that it can transfer the most heat from the heat (transfer) medium per unit mass {{due to the fact that}} the average temperature difference along any unit length is higher. See countercurrent exchange. In a <b>cross-flow</b> heat exchanger, the fluids travel roughly perpendicular to one another through the exchanger.|$|E

25|$|The Alfetta saloon was {{the base}} for the Alfetta GT, a 2-door, 4-seater {{fastback}} coupé designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro at Italdesign. Introduced in 1974, similarly to the saloon it was initially available only with the 1.8-litre (1,779cc) version of the Alfa DOHC four. These engines featured a chain driven 8-valve twin overhead cam cylinder head of <b>cross-flow</b> design. For 1976, with the final phasing out of the earlier 105 Series (GT1300 Junior and GT1600 Junior and 2000GTV), the Alfetta GT became a range; the 1.8 was discontinued in favour of the 1.6-litre (1,570cc) Alfetta GT1.6 and 2.0-litre (1,962cc) Alfetta GTV2.0. At the same time some updates were introduced, such as a new front grille with horizontal slats and two series of vents beneath it. The GTV was distinguished from the 1.6 version by twin chrome whiskers in the grille and GTV scripts carved in the ventilation vents on the C-pillar.|$|E
25|$|It {{was decided}} to design a new diesel engine family that could be {{produced}} in various capacities and states of tune suitable for all of Rover's needs. The development was codenamed Project Storm and design responsibility was given to Land Rover who were to build the engines. The result was a range of engines using the L-Series as a base—the bore/stroke dimensions were the same and the Storm engine used the same piston and connecting rod assemblies. The Storm utilised Electronic Unit Injection by Lucas (at the time this technology was rare on small-capacity engine, being used only on large commercial vehicles) and a <b>cross-flow</b> aluminium alloy cylinder head on a cast-iron block. The designers had aimed at increasing servicing intervals so the engine incorporated both conventional and centrifugal oil filters. The electronic systems included an 'anti-stall' system to allow heavy loads to be started from rest at idle speed and two programmed operating modes for road and off-road use. The overhead camshaft (operating both valves and the unit injectors) was chain-driven. The Storm design encompassed 4-, 5- and 6-cylinder engines (of 2, 2.5 and 3 litres respectively).|$|E

Awkward packaging under the low bonnet coupled with Holden's decision to utilise a <b>cross-flow</b> radiator (as opposed to the up-down flow radiator installed to the equivalent Nissan Skyline) meant the six-cylinder engine was especially susceptible to cracked cylinder heads, a problem not displayed on the Nissan Skyline with which it shares the RB30E engine.

2500|$|The main {{condenser}} {{is a large}} <b>cross-flow</b> tube-and-shell {{heat exchanger}} that takes wet vapor, a mixture of liquid water and steam at saturation conditions, from the turbine-generator exhaust and condenses it back into subcooled liquid water {{so it can be}} pumped back to the reactor by the condensate and feedwater pumps. [...] This condensing process is accomplished by allowing the wet vapor turbine exhaust to come into contact with thousands of tubes that have much colder water flowing through them on the other side. [...] The cooling water will typically come from a natural body of water such as a river or lake. [...] Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, located in the desert about 60 miles west of Phoenix, Arizona, is the only nuclear facility that does not use a natural body of water for cooling, instead using treated sewage from the greater Phoenix metropolitan area. [...] The <b>cross-flow</b> aspect of a typical main condenser means the two fluids that are exchanging heat, turbine exhaust and the cold water from a river or other water source, are flowing in perpendicular directions. [...] This is extremely effective at allowing for phase separation, that is, the heavier, condensed water falls off of the condenser tubes into the condenser hotwell found {{at the bottom of the}} heat exchanger and awaits its turn to be pumped. [...] The water coming from the cooling body of water is either pumped back to the water source at a warmer temperature or returns to a cooling tower where it either cools for more uses or evaporates into water vapor that rises out the top of the tower.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of wine production, terroir {{is a concept that}} {{encompasses}} the varieties of grapes used, elevation and shape of the vineyard, type and chemistry of soil, climate and seasonal conditions, and the local yeast cultures. The range of possible combinations of these factors can result in great differences among wines, influencing the fermentation, finishing, and aging processes as well. Many wineries use growing and production methods that preserve or accentuate the aroma and taste influences of their unique terroir. However, flavor differences are less desirable for producers of mass-market table wine or other cheaper wines, where consistency takes precedence.

Anatomical variations, such as absent or surgically clamped vessels, can result in undesirable flow patterns. These can affect the brain's ability to maintain cerebral perfusion {{and the formation of}} cerebral aneurysms. An experimental test system was developed to simulate cerebral physiological conditions through three flexible 3 D patient-specific models of complete and incomplete CoW geometries. Flow visualizations were performed with isobaric dyes and the mapped dye streamlines were tracked throughout the models. Three to seven flow impact locations were observed for all configurations, corresponding to known sites for aneurysmal formation. Uni and bi-directional <b>cross-flows</b> occurred along the communicating arteries. The greatest shunting of flow occurred for a missing pre-communicating anterior (A 1) and posterior (P 1) cerebral arteries. The anterior cerebral arteries had the greatest reduction (15 - 37 %) in efferent flow rates for missing either a unilateral A 1 or bilateral P 1 segments. The bi-directional <b>cross-flows,</b> with multiple afferent flow mixing, observed along the communicating arteries may explain the propensity of aneurysm formation at these sites.

2500|$|Most {{filtration}} in a winery can {{be classified}} as either the coarser depth filtration or the finer surface filtration. In depth filtration, often done after fermentation, the wine is pushed through {{a thick layer of}} pads made from cellulose fibers, diatomaceous earth, or perlite. [...] In surface filtration, the wine passes through a thin membrane. Running the wine parallel to the filter surface, known as <b>cross-flow</b> filtration, will minimize the filter clogging. The finest surface filtration, microfiltration, can sterilize the wine by trapping all yeast and, optionally, bacteria, and so is often done immediately prior to bottling. An absolute rated filter of 0.45µm is generally considered to result in a microbially stable wine and is accomplished by the use of membrane cartridges, most commonly polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). Certain red wines may be filtered to 0.65µm, to remove yeast, or to 1.0µm to remove viable brettanomyces only.|$|E
