40|$|Research into Malay adult {{learners}} and self-directed learning in Malaysia {{is far from}} its saturation point and still offers many avenues for research. There {{appeared to be a}} gap in research information on the Malay <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> and self-directed learning. Limited research has been conducted to close the gap between Malay <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> and self-directed learning. Hence, the study undertook the task of closing the gap between Malay <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> and self-directed learning by looking at how the Malay <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> help to shape the self-directedness of the Malay adult learners. The research employed the qualitative approach and used journal entries, observations and interviews as its data collection method. Six Malay <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> derived from literature were chosen- harmonious, collective, sensitive, approval seeking, religious and maintaining face as the <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> upheld by the Malays. Four Malay adult learners who were pursuing postgraduate degrees in a local university participated in the study. The study found that three participants were very self-directed while the other participant was less self-directed. The findings also indicated four pertinent Malay <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> in the participants-harmonious, collective, sensitive and maintaining face and these Malay <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> helped to shape the Malay adult learners. It was found that these Malay <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> help shaped the respondents to become a careful adult learner, a survivor, an active learner and an optimistic learner. Hence, the study would conclude that <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> {{have a role to play}} in shaping the self-directedness of the Malay adult learners. As such, the study recommends a cultural process framework and an inventory to better understand how <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> help to shape the self-directed learning of the Malay adult learners...|$|R

The results of the empiric research have revealed that the aim of top state bodies to know the fair value has some contradictions: however all values will be evaluated, it should be a number, but not the fair value. In order to identify the latter even approximately, the state should appoint additional funds for evaluation, as it is very difficult to do it with actual human resources...|$|R

With the interest in the series, otaku culture became a mass social phenomenon. The show's regular reruns increased the number of otaku, which John Lynden links to a boom in interest in literature on the Dead Sea Scrolls, Kabbalah and Christianity. Anime director Makoto Shinkai declared that the genre of anime owes a cinematographic debt to Evangelion. In the aftermath of Evangelion, Anno reused many of its stylistic conceits in the live-action Love & Pop and the anime romance Kare Kano. Neon Genesis Evangelion also influenced some music artists, such as the UK band Fightstar and its debut album, Grand Unification, and the Japanese band Rey, which derived its name from the character of Rei Ayanami.|$|E
