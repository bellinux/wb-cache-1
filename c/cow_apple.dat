5000|$|Solanum mammosum is {{commonly}} known as nipplefruit, fox head, <b>cow's</b> udder, or <b>apple</b> of Sodom, is an inedible Pan-American tropical fruit. The plant is grown for ornamental purposes, {{in part because of the}} distal end of the fruit's resemblance to a human breast, while the proximal end looks like a cow's udder. It is an annual in the Solanaceae family, and part of the Solanum genus, making the plant a relative of the eggplant, tomato, and potato. This poisonous fruit is native to South America, but has been naturalized in Southern Mexico, Greater Antilles, Central America, and the Caribbean. The plant adapts well to most soils, but thrives in moist, loamy soil.The plant has thin simple leaves occurring in alternating branching patterns with prominent venation. Hairy thorns cover the stem and branches of the plant. The inflorescence contains five to eight purple elongating buds. The fruit is a berry type, and has waxy yellow skin with reddish-brown seeds. The plant is propagated by the distribution of seeds.|$|R

'Sacred to the memory' ought to be written on his forehead. I shall never forget the first sermon he preached after he came. It was on the subject of {{everyone}} doing what they were best fitted for--a very good subject, of course; but such illustrations as he used! He said, 'If you had a <b>cow</b> and an <b>apple</b> tree, and if you tied the apple tree in your stable and planted the cow in your orchard, with her legs up, how much milk would you get from the apple tree, or how many apples from the cow?' Did you ever hear the like in your born days, dearie? I was so thankful there were no Methodists there that day--they'd never have been done hooting over it. But what I dislike most in him is his habit of agreeing with everybody, no matter what is said. If you said to him, 'You're a scoundrel,' he'd say, with that smooth smile of his, 'Yes, that's so.' A minister should have more backbone. The long and the short of it is, I consider him a reverend jackass. But, of course, this is just between you and me. When there are Methodists in hearing I praise him to the skies. Some folks think his wife dresses too gay, but I say when she has to live with a face like that she needs something to cheer her up. You'll never hear ME condemning a woman for her dress. I'm only too thankful when her husband isn't too mean and miserly to allow it. Not that I bother much with dress myself. Women just dress to please the men, and I'd never stoop to THAT. I have had a real placid, comfortable life, dearie, and it's just because I never cared a cent what the men thought." ...|$|R
40|$|Higher feeding {{costs and}} {{shortage}} of animal feed-stuffs {{in many parts}} of the word have increased the number of studies on agricultural by-products used as feeds for ruminants (Lashkari & Taghizadeh, 2013). Some of those by-products derive from industrial extraction and processing of fruits, vegetables and crops (Lashkari et al., 2014). The annual amount of produced agricultural by-products in Iran is high, e. g. production of apple (Malus domestica) pomace exceeds 2. 7 million tonnes year– 1. Apple pomace is a palatable raw material and has considerable attention as a source of sugar, pectin, and phenolic component (Sato et al., 2010). In fact, apple pomace is a suitable source of energy for ruminant, but its crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration are low (Pirmohammadi et al., 2006). However, high moisture content is the main problem in storage of agricultural by-products because of its susceptibility for spoiling, fungi and mold can expose to risk human and animal health (Lashkari et al., 2014). Therefore, usage of apple pomace as feedstuff requires its preservation by dehydration or ensiling (Pirmoham-madi et al., 2006). Drying of apple pomace is costly; whereas its ensilage is cheaper and more practical for farmers. Apple pomace silage has been successfully used as a feed for ruminants. Rumsey (1979) showed that all of the beef cattle diet forage can be replaced by apple pomace without any adverse effect on the performance. Using of apple pomace in fattening lambs ration improved average daily gain, dry matter intake and feed conversion ratio (Karami et al., 1996). Broiler litter has been also successfully used as a cattle feed around the world for a long time (Kwak et al., 2004). Broiler litter is composed of poultry excreta, bedding, feathers, spilled feed, etc. Broiler litter contains 25 - 30 % CP kg of dry matter (Ruffin & McCaskey, 1990) and approximately 50 % of that is made up by true protein. The remainder is nonprotein nitrogen, which is primarily composed by uric acid (Bhattacharya & Taylor, 1975).

40|$|Why a kg MS per kg LW? A {{fair number}} of dairy farmers in the South Island have passed the 400 kg MS per cow mark and are keen to further {{increase}} per cow production to 500 kg MS for a 500 kg live weight (LW) <b>cow.</b> To compare <b>apples</b> with apples the challenge can be 400 kg MS for a Jersey, 450 kg MS for a Crossbred, 500 kg for a NZ Friesian and 600 kg MS for an OS Holstein Friesian cow: “a kg MS per kg LW”. Farmers have their own reasons for a further increase in per cow production: • Increase total MS production of the same area • Produce the same MS with less cows and therefore reducing the per cow costs (e. g. labour, animal health, breeding) often rated at $ 300 - 500 per cow, i. e. increase profits • Put less feed into maintenance and more into milk production • Utilise more of the genetic potential of their cows • They like to see and work with happy, well fed and well performing cows. This paper focuses mainly on how to feed cows for 500 kg in a pasture based system on the Mainland, however {{this can not be}} seen separate from management of cows, pasture and supplements. Different ways to achieve 500 kg MS Basically {{there are two ways to}} achieve more MS per cow: 1. Increase days in milk 2. Increase average kg MS per day Calving cows a week earlier or drying cows off a week later can yield 10 - 15 kg MS. This is not only a case of bringing the planned start of calving forward; a more condensed calving and less drying off to correct poor condition will increase average days in milk per lactation in an easy manner. The average kg MS per day can increase through a higher peak yield and/or an improved persistence, less post peak decline. Figure 1 displays 2 different lactation curves which both achieve 500 kg MS per lactation, assuming 280 days in milk. The normal curve peaks to 2. 6 kg MS and declines faster post peak. The persistent curve peaks at 2. 4 kg MS which is easier to achieve in a pasture based system and requires less peak shares...|$|R
