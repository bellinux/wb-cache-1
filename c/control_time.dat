It {{was the first time}} she had [...] "been involved with a movie from the moment it’s a germ of an idea right through the whole editing process." [...] Her daughter had a small role as the younger Selene. The film was a box office success, grossing $111 million worldwide.

500|$|Lara Croft has {{appeared}} in two motion pictures. The first, , was released in 2001, and follows Croft as she encounters the Illuminati, a group searching for a relic able to <b>control</b> <b>time.</b> The film depicted Croft's backstory differently from the version in the early games. In the films, Lara Croft's mother {{died in a plane}} crash and her father disappeared in Cambodia; in the games, both parents are alive. A similar backstory was adopted in 2006 in Legend. The sequel, , depicts Croft in search of Pandora's box in competition with a Chinese crime syndicate. Development for a third movie was announced in 2009. Producer Graham King planned to release the film in 2013. GameTap released [...] in 2007 via the GameTap TV section of its website. The web series is a collection of ten short animated films that features re-imagined versions of Croft by well-known animators, comic book artists, and writers, including Jim Lee, Warren Ellis, and Peter Chung. Episodes ranged from five to seven and half minutes in length, featuring Minnie Driver as Croft. The creative staff was given considerable freedom to re-interpret the character; they did not consult the video game designers, but were given a guide listing acceptable and unacceptable practices.|$|E

40|$|Continuous descent {{operations}} with <b>controlled</b> <b>times</b> of arrival at one or several metering fixes could enable environmentally friendly procedures without compromising terminal airspace capacity. This paper focuses on <b>controlled</b> <b>time</b> of arrival updates once the descent has been already initiated, assessing the feasible time window (and associated fuel consumption) of continuous descent operations requiring neither thrust nor speed-brake usage along the whole descent (i. e. only elevator control {{is used to}} achieve different metering times). Based on previous works, an optimal control problem is formulated and numerically solved. The earliest and latest times of arrival at the initial approach fix have been computed for the descent of an Airbus A 320 under different scenarios, considering the potential altitudes and distances to go when receiving the <b>controlled</b> <b>time</b> of arrival update. The effects of the aircraft mass, initial speed, longitudinal wind and position of the initial approach fix on the time window have been also investigated. Results show that time windows about three minutes could be achieved for certain conditions, {{and that there is}} a trade-off between robustness facing <b>controlled</b> <b>time</b> of arrival updates during the descent and fuel consumption.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} relationship between regulatory mode orientations (locomotion and assessment), time management behaviours and the perceived <b>control</b> of <b>time.</b> "Locomotion" refers to the aspect of self-regulation involving the movement from state to state, whereas "assessment" is the comparative aspect of self-regulation that refers to the critical evaluation of alternative goals and the means for achieving them. The Italian versions of the Time Management Behavior Scale and the Perceived <b>Control</b> of <b>Time</b> Scale, {{as well as the}} Locomotion and Assessment Regulatory Modes Scales were administered to 339 Italian participants (249 students and 90 employees). The results supported the notion that locomotors and assessors differ in the ways they perceive the <b>control</b> of <b>time.</b> Locomotion was found to be positively related to perceived <b>control</b> of <b>time.</b> In contrast, assessment was negatively related to perceived <b>control</b> of <b>time.</b> Furthermore, the two time management dimensions of setting goals and priorities and preference for organisation were shown to mediate {{the relationship between}} locomotion and perceived <b>control</b> of <b>time,</b> whereas assessment proved to be unrelated to all time management behaviours.

40|$|The popular {{literature}} on <b>time</b> <b>control</b> claims that learning <b>time</b> <b>control</b> behaviors results in increased job performance and fewer job tensions. This study examines {{the relationships of}} one's <b>control</b> of <b>time</b> to job stress, job performance and job satisfaction from a correlational perspective. In addition, a test of a time and stress management seminar {{and its effect on}} job performance, job satisfaction and job stress in an organizational setting is made. <b>Time</b> <b>control</b> is defined as consisting of not only the typically taught behaviors (making lists, goal setting) but also a perception of <b>control</b> of <b>time.</b> 178 employees of a large southwestern social service agency completed several scales including the <b>Time</b> <b>Control</b> instrument (see Macan et al., 1987) and provided demographic information. Supervisors provided performance ratings. In general, the results do not support the conventional notions of time management. First of all, <b>Time</b> <b>Control</b> was not found to be a unitary concept. Instead, <b>Time</b> <b>Control</b> was found to be multi-dimensional, consisting of four relatively individual factors. The factors were: perceived <b>control</b> of <b>time,</b> goal setting/prioritizing, mechanics [...] scheduling, planning, and work organization. Only those who perceived <b>control</b> of their <b>time</b> reported fewer job-induced and somatic tensions and were more satisfied in their job situation. The relationship between <b>time</b> <b>control</b> and job performance was non-significant. In addition, perceived <b>control</b> of <b>time</b> was not significantly correlated with the other factors. Overall, those tending toward Type B and those on the job fewer months accounted for the variance in individual differences on three of the four <b>time</b> <b>control</b> factors. Individual differences due to education, age and minority/nonminority also played a role. In addition, an evaluation of a time and stress management training seminar was made. Acknowledging the limitations of the data on 20 training and 24 control group participants, {{the results of this study}} do not support the claims made by time management consultants. The findings indicated that <b>time</b> <b>control</b> training was not related to increased job performance ratings or fewer tensions four- to-five months following training. Taken as a whole, the present results call into question the assertations made by advocates of time management training...|$|R
