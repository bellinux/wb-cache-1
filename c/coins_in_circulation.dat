5|$|The {{possible}} {{reasons for the}} clipping of coins are controversial. Possible explanations include fraud, a deliberate attempt to maintain a stable ratio between gold and silver coins, or an official attempt to provide {{a new source of}} silver bullion while maintaining the same number of <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b>|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of myths and legends {{associated}} with the origin of the name Delhi. One of them is derived from Dhillu or Dilu, a king who built a city at this location in 50BC and named it after himself. Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Hindi/Prakrit word dhili (loose) and that it was used by the Tomaras to refer to the city because the Iron Pillar of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved. The <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> in the region under the Tomaras were called dehliwal. According to the Bhavishya Purana, King Prithiviraja of Indraprastha built a new fort in the modern-day Purana Qila area for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom. He ordered the construction of a gateway to the fort and later named the fort dehali. Some historians believe that the name is derived from Dilli, a corruption of the Hindustani words dehleez or dehali—both terms meaning 'threshold' or 'gateway'—and symbolic of the city as a gateway to the Gangetic Plain. Another theory suggests that the city's original name was Dhillika.|$|E

25|$|In the 1990s, the Royal Mint {{reduced the}} sizes of the 5p, 10p, and 50p coins. As a consequence, the oldest 5p <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> date from 1990, the oldest 10p coins from 1992 and the oldest 50p coins come from 1997. Since 1997, many special {{commemorative}} designs of 50p have been issued. Some of these are found fairly frequently in circulation and some are rare. They are all legal tender.|$|E
25|$|Surveys {{had found}} that 50, 20 and 10c coins were too large {{and could not be}} easily carried in large quantities. The {{original}} 50c coin, with a diameter of 3.2 centimetres, was one of the largest <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> worldwide, and the original 20c coin, New Zealand's second biggest coin at the time at 2.8cm, is bigger than any current circulating coin (the biggest coin in circulation is the $2 coin at 2.6cm).|$|E
25|$|Until 1966, 10- and 50-hwan coins, revalued as 1 and 5 won, {{were the}} only <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b> New coins, {{denominated}} in won, were introduced by the Bank of Korea on August 16, 1966, in denominations of 1, 5 and 10 won, with the 1 won struck in brass and the 5 and 10 won in bronze. These were the first South Korean coins to display the date in the common era, earlier coins having used the Korean calendar. The 10- and 50-hwan coins were demonetized on March 22, 1975.|$|E

50|$|The New Zealand two-dollar coin is the largest-denomination coin of the New Zealand dollar. It was {{introduced}} {{along with the}} one-dollar <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> 1990. Both are made from an alloy of aluminium and brass. It is the largest and heaviest <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation,</b> weighing ten grams and measuring 26.5 millimetres in diameter. Its thickness is 2.7 mm, only 0.4 mm thinner than the one-dollar coin, thus it is the second-thickest <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> the country's <b>circulation.</b>|$|R
50|$|To keep <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation,</b> President Gabriel García Moreno {{prohibited}} {{the export of}} coin 666 fine. The circulation of various kinds of tokens became common. Imbabura Province, in the north, was authorized to allow the free circulation of Colombian francos.|$|R
25|$|The {{currency}} of Gibraltar is the Gibraltar pound, {{issued by the}} Government of Gibraltar {{under the terms of}} the 1934 Currency Notes Act. These banknotes are legal tender in Gibraltar alongside Bank of England banknotes. In a currency board arrangement, these notes are issued against reserves of sterling. Clearing and settlement of funds is conducted in sterling. <b>Coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> follow British denominations but have separate designs. Unofficially, most retail outlets in Gibraltar accept the euro, though some payphones and the Royal Gibraltar Post Office, along with all other government offices, do not.|$|E
25|$|This {{has been}} a {{particular}} problem with nickels and dimes (and with some comparable coins in other currencies) because of their relatively low face value and unstable commodity prices. For a while the copper in US pennies was worth more than one cent, so people would hoard pennies and then melt them down for their metal value. It cost more than face value to manufacture pennies or nickels, so any widespread loss of the <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> could be expensive for the US Treasury. This {{was more of a}} problem when coins were still made of precious metals like silver and gold, so strict laws against alteration make more sense historically.|$|E
25|$|Under the new system, {{the pound}} was {{retained}} but {{was divided into}} 100 new pence, denoted by the symbol p. New coinage was issued alongside the old coins. The 5p and 10p coins were introduced in April 1968 and were the same size, composition, and value as the shilling and two shillings <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> with them. In October 1969 the 50p coin was introduced, with the 10s note withdrawn on 20 November 1970. This {{reduced the number of}} new coins that had to be introduced on Decimal Day and meant that the public was already familiar with three of the six new coins. Small booklets were made available containing {{some or all of the}} new denominations.|$|E
50|$|The colonies {{had many}} {{currencies}} and <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulations.</b> However, {{there was a}} shortage of currency for those wishing {{to use it as}} a medium of exchange. There were additional costs to facilitating some trades which was avoided by the use of credit.|$|R

25|$|In 1399, Henry, Duke of Lancaster – another {{grandson}} of Edward III – overthrew his cousin and ruled as Henry IV (1399–1413). This was a turbulent time with wars being fought in both Scotland and Wales, and the coinage {{problems of the}} previous reign continued; the price of silver and gold was low in England compared to Europe, and coins were illegally smuggled abroad, causing major problems in England as not only were there insufficient <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation,</b> but the mints could not buy enough bullion to make new coins. Henry IV's pennies are divided into heavy coinage (prior to 1412), when {{the weight of the}} coins had not been adjusted to reflect the continental price of silver, and the light coinage of 1412–13 when the silver content was reduced to correspond to the continental price of silver, thus putting an end to the illegal export of English coinage. The heavy coinage was minted at London and York, inscribed HENRIC DI GRA REX ANGL – Henry by the Grace of God King of England, while the light coinage was minted at London, York, and Durham, inscribed HENRIC REX ANGLIE.|$|E
25|$|In King Henry III's long reign (1216–1272) the short-cross penny {{continued}} in use until 1247. By then, however, {{through no fault}} of the moneyers' there was a problem in that many of the <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> were underweight. This was caused by the illegal practice of clipping silver {{off the edge of the}} coin, which was made easier by the cross on the reverse not extending to the rim thus giving people no clear indication of exactly how big the coin was supposed to be. In 1247 therefore, a new long-cross penny replaced the short-cross coin, which made it more obvious when the coin had been clipped. Apart from the change in the size of the cross, the rest of the design did not substantially change, and the long cross made it easy to cut the coin into halves or quarters for change. Because of the introduction of the new coinage it was necessary to reopen many of the old mints to supply sufficient coins. Short-cross Henry III pennies were minted at Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, London, Winchester and York. Long-cross pennies were produced at Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Carlisle, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford, Ilchester, Lincoln, London, Newcastle, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Shrewsbury, Wallingford, Wilton, Winchester, and York.|$|E
25|$|Some {{games of}} this era were {{so popular that}} they entered popular culture. The first to do so was Space Invaders. The game was so popular upon its release in 1978 that an urban legend blamed it for a {{national}} shortage of 100 yen coins in Japan, leading to a production increase of coins to meet demand for the game (although 100 yen coin production was lower in 1978 and 1979 than in previous or subsequent years, and the claim does not withstand logical scrutiny: arcade operators would have emptied out their machines and taken {{the money to the}} bank, thus keeping the <b>coins</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation).</b> It would soon have a similar impact in North America, where it has appeared or is referenced in numerous facets of popular culture. Soon after the release of Space Invaders, hundreds of favourable articles and stories about the emerging video game medium aired on television and were printed in newspapers and magazines. The Space Invaders Tournament held by Atari in 1980 was the first video game competition and attracted more than 10,000 participants, establishing video gaming as a mainstream hobby. By 1980, 86% of the 13–20 population in the United States had played arcade video games, and by 1981, there were more than 35 million gamers visiting video game arcades in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Staff tokens {{were issued}} to staff of {{businesses}} <b>in</b> lieu of <b>coin.</b> <b>In</b> the 19th century the argument supporting payment to staff was {{the shortage of}} <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation,</b> but <b>in</b> reality employees were forced to spend their wages in the company's stores at highly inflated prices—resulting in an effective dramatic lowering of their actual salary and disposable income.|$|R
25|$|<b>Coins</b> {{currently}} <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> are 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 dinara coins. All coins feature identical inscriptions in Serbian, {{using the}} Cyrillic and Latin scripts.

50|$|The half laurel was {{introduced}} to replace the double crown of 1604, which had an initial value of ten shillings but whose value had been increased to eleven shillings in 1612 because of the increasing value of gold; the need was felt for a ten-shilling <b>coin</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> again.|$|R
