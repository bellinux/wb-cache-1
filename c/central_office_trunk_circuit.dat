50|$|In telephony, a {{function}} which, when activated {{in the event}} of a commercial power failure or a low-voltage battery condition at a subscriber location, supplies power to predesignated subscriber equipment via the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>trunk.</b>|$|R
50|$|A key {{telephone}} system was originally distinguished {{from a private}} branch exchange (PBX) in {{that it did not}} require an operator or attendant at the switchboard to establish connections between the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> <b>trunks</b> and stations, or between stations. Technologically, private branch exchanges share lineage with <b>central</b> <b>office</b> telephone systems, and in larger or more complex systems, may rival a <b>central</b> <b>office</b> system in capacity and features. With a {{key telephone}} system, a station user could control the connections directly using line buttons, which indicated the status of lines with built-in lamps.|$|R
50|$|Trunk {{lines are}} used for {{connecting}} a private branch exchange (PBX) to a telephone service provider. When needed {{they can be used}} by any telephone connected to the PBX, while the station lines to the extensions serve only one station telephones. Trunking saves cost, because there are usually fewer trunk lines than extension lines, since it is unusual in most offices to have all extension lines in use for external calls at once. Trunk lines transmit voice and data in formats such as analog, T1, E1, ISDN or PRI. The dial tone lines for outgoing calls are called DDCO (Direct Dial <b>Central</b> <b>Office)</b> <b>trunks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) is a telephone exchange or switching system that serves a private organization and performs concentration of <b>central</b> <b>office</b> lines or <b>trunks</b> and provides intercommunication between {{a large number of}} telephone stations in the organization. The <b>central</b> <b>office</b> lines provide connections to the public switched telephone network and the concentration aspect of a PBX permits the shared use of these lines between all stations in the organization. [...] allows two or more stations to directly connect while not using the public switched telephone network.|$|R
5000|$|At {{this point}} it would good to state {{that there are two}} types of T-1 circuits; Channelized T-1 and Full T-1 - (Channelized T-1) is where by you have 24 {{channels}} of 64k each that can carry voice traffic and commonly found as the CO (<b>Central</b> <b>Office)</b> <b>trunk</b> in a PBX. In this case a DID or Direct Inward Dial would be used. A DID is where by you would have a T-1 and have say 100 phone numbers used to dial in to a business. The chances that all 24 channels of the T-1 being used at the same time would be small, however the PBX and business would need to study the capacity needed for multi T-1s. These same T-1 channels can also be used for out bound calls as well. (Full T-1) is where you use the entire 1.544 Mb of the T-1 for data. This data can be anything from company servers or the internet. Any data can be placed on the Full T-1. It’s worth noting, you can place data on a channelized T-1, but you’re limited to the 64k bandwidth of the channel. Several channels can be used to add capacity. The T-1 uses a pair of twisted copper wires from the CO (<b>Central</b> <b>Office)</b> the local on premise NIU (network Interface Unit) card. Pictured to the above right is a two card wall mount cabinet. Under the wall cabinet is a smart jack (RJ45). The NIU then uses 4 twisted copper wires to the end device (i.e. CISCO Router, Firewall, PBX, etc.) by a Cat 3 or high network type jumper cable.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{members and}} {{associates}} paid annual subscription fees tailored for their class, {{half of which}} went to the local group and half to the <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> Associates provided [...] "recreation rooms" [...] often in parish facilities, although sometimes in their own homes, where working-class girls could meet with associates and each other, read, sew, sing, and enjoy simple refreshments. Later [...] "houses of rest" [...] were established for these purposes. The local groups were called [...] "branches" [...] and the whole organization was conceived of as a large tree with the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> as the <b>trunk,</b> and the members as leaves.|$|R
50|$|Message <b>Trunk</b> <b>Circuit</b> or CLCI MSG codes {{provide a}} naming scheme for message <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits.</b> These codes {{identify}} individual trunks and trunk groups by number, office class, traffic use, trunk type modifier, signaling, and the originating and terminating office locations.|$|R

2500|$|When {{a calling}} party lifted the receiver, the local loop current lit a signal lamp near the jack. The {{operator}} responded by inserting the rear cord (answering cord) into the subscriber's jack and switched her headset into the circuit to ask, [...] "Number, please?" [...] For a local call, the operator inserted the front cord {{of the pair}} (ringing cord) into the called party's local jack and started the ringing cycle. For a long distance call, she plugged into a <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> to connect to another operator in another bank of boards or at a remote <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> In 1918, the average time to complete the connection for a long-distance call was 15 minutes.|$|R

50|$|The {{card sorter}} of the 4A/CTS (Number 4A Crossbar / Card Translator System) allowed six digit {{translation}} of the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> code number dialed by the customer. This determined the proper <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> to use, where separate circuit groups were used for different cities {{in the same area}} code, {{as in the case of}} Oakland and San Francisco. The new device used metal cards similar in principle to computer punched cards, and they were rapidly scanned as they fell past a light beam. On busy days, it sounded like a machine gun firing. CTS machines were called 4A (Advanced) if the translator was included in the original installation, and 4M (Modified) if it was added later. A 1970s version of 4XB, the 4A/ETS, used a computer to translate. For international dialing, Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) provided the extra computer power.|$|R
50|$|In {{early and}} middle 20th century {{telephone}} exchanges this task {{was done by}} a supervisory relay set known variously as junctor circuit or district junctor. Later designs made it {{a function of the}} <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> or absorbed it into software.|$|R
50|$|As in {{previous}} designs, supervision of incoming calls is handled by relay sets known as incoming <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits.</b> Unlike {{in previous}} designs, {{this work is}} also done in the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> for outgoing calls, {{so there are no}} junctor circuits. Since different outgoing trunks are connected to different places and are used for different calls, their relay sets can be specialized for a particular kind of signalling or call metering (see automatic message accounting) or other peculiarity. Thus a TSPS trunk can give complete control to an operator, while an E and M signaling trunk can do the kind of signaling required of a private long-distance line, while a local outgoing trunk can be simpler.|$|R
25|$|These voltage {{changes on}} the <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> would cause pops or clicks that were audible to the {{subscriber}} as the electrical handshaking stepped through its protocol. Another handshake, to start timing for billing purposes, caused {{a second set of}} clunks when the called party answered.|$|R
25|$|Examples {{of signals}} {{communicating}} supervision or call progress include E and M signaling, SF signaling, and robbed-bit signaling. In physical (not carrier) E and M <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits,</b> <b>trunks</b> were four wire. Fifty trunks {{would require a}} hundred pair cable between switches, for example. Conductors in one common circuit configuration were named tip, ring, ear (E) and mouth (M). Tip and ring were the voice-carrying pair, and named after the tip and ring on the three conductor cords on the manual operator's console.|$|R
50|$|During this era, most voice {{connections}} used analog <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> {{that were}} designed to conform with the Via Net Loss plan established by Bell Laboratories. The purpose of the VNL plan and five-level long distance switching hierarchy was to minimize the number of <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> in a call and maximize the voice quality of the connections. Excessive loss in a voice connection meant that subscribers may have difficulty hearing each other. This was particularly important in the 1960s when dial up data connections were developed {{with the use of}} analog modems. The SES evaluated multi-frequency outpulsing signaling as well as voice impairments including sound amplitude, noise, echo, {{and a variety of other}} parameters. Deployment of common-channel signaling systems such as Common Channel Interoffice Signaling and later Signaling System #7 obviated the need to monitor multi-frequency signaling as it became obsolete.|$|R
25|$|Some {{signalling}} communicated dialed digits. An early form called Panel Call Indicator Pulsing used quaternary pulses {{to set up}} calls {{between a}} panel switch and a manual switchboard. Probably {{the most common form}} of communicating dialed digits between electromechanical switches was sending dial pulses, equivalent to a rotary dial's pulsing, but sent over <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> between switches.|$|R

Four Central European countries joined the network. Research networks upgraded their access capacity to 2 Mbit/s, <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> on the busiest routes were upgraded to 8 Mbit/s, and 4 Mbit/s access ports were made available and became operational.|$|R

50|$|Also taking {{advantage}} of the superior versatility of 5XB, Centrex was invented as a service package. Later stored program control exchanges allowed more extensive service features. Autovon originally used a four-wire version of 5XB, with a more complex marker to implement its nonhierarchical polygrid routing system, and <b>trunk</b> <b>circuits</b> with additional logic and data storage built in to implement preemption.|$|R
50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{outgoing}} <b>trunks</b> are selected by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each <b>trunk</b> <b>circuit</b> provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its trunk link frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle trunks in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the trunk link frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an idle trunk and then connect to that trunk through the trunk link connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle trunks. This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a trunk group to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|R

50|$|A {{telephone}} exchange name or <b>central</b> <b>office</b> name was a distinguishing and memorable name {{assigned to a}} <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> It identified the switching system to which a telephone was connected. Each <b>central</b> <b>office</b> served a maximum of 10,000 subscriber lines identified by the last four digits of the telephone number. Areas or cities with more subscribers were served by multiple <b>central</b> <b>offices,</b> possibly hosted in the same building. The leading letters of a <b>central</b> <b>office</b> name were used as the leading components of the telephone number representation, so that each telephone number in an area was unique. These letters were mapped to digits, which was indicated visibly on a dial telephone.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} {{trunking}} (resource sharing) {{is actually quite}} old, and is taken from telephone company technology and practice. Consider two telco <b>central</b> <b>office</b> exchanges, one in town [...] "A" [...] {{and the other in}} adjacent town [...] "B". Each of these <b>central</b> <b>offices</b> has the theoretical capacity to handle ten thousand individual telephone numbers. (<b>Central</b> <b>office</b> [...] "A", with prefix [...] "123", has available 10,000 numbers from 123-0000 to 123-9999; <b>central</b> <b>office</b> [...] "B", with prefix [...] "124", the same.) ...|$|R
50|$|An {{intermediary}} {{is created}} within the organisation usually treasury or <b>central</b> <b>office.</b> All the fund-raising units raise {{funds from the}} market at a particular rate and lend the same to the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> at a higher rate. All the lending units borrow the funds from the <b>central</b> <b>office</b> at a particular rate and lend the same to the borrowers at a higher rate. The <b>central</b> <b>office</b> rate is notional in nature and is aligned to market conditions. Thus for all the units there are two rates available to measure the performance. For a deposit-raising unit the difference between interest paid to the deposit-holders and interest receivable from <b>central</b> <b>office</b> is the contribution to the bank's profitability. For a lending division the difference between Interest payable to <b>central</b> <b>office</b> and the interest received from the borrowers is the contribution to the bank's performance.|$|R
