40|$|A {{survey on}} free {{biogenic}} amine contents in fresh and preserved vegetable products was carried out. A simple extraction method, involving an homogenisation step with 0. 1 M HCl, was applied. Two different derivatization procedures (using o-phthaldialdehyde and dansyl chloride) were applied on different aliquots {{of the same}} acid extracts and HPLC analyses were carried out with the same reversed phase (C 18) HPLC column. Results obtained with the two procedures were compared. With the exception of sauerkraut, putrescine (0. 2 – 0. 5 mg/ 100 g fresh weight) and spermidine (0. 4 – 4. 5 mg/ 100 g) were always the most represented amines, generally followed by spermine (maximum 1. 1 mg/ 100 g). Tyramine level was 4. 9 mg/ 100 g in <b>canned</b> <b>sauerkraut</b> while other samples pre- sented levels not exceeding 1. 2 mg/ 100 g. The spinach sample showed the highest histamine content (2. 0 mg/ 100 g) ...|$|E

5000|$|The gastronomic {{symbol of}} the région is {{undoubtedly}} the Choucroute, a local variety of Sauerkraut. The word Sauerkraut in Alsatian has the form sûrkrût, same as in other southwestern German dialects, and means [...] "sour cabbage" [...] as its Standard German equivalent. This word was included into the French language as choucroute. To make it, the cabbage is finely shredded, layered with salt and juniper and left to ferment in wooden barrels. <b>Sauerkraut</b> <b>can</b> be served with poultry, pork, sausage or even fish. Traditionally it is served with pork, Strasbourg sausage or frankfurters, bacon, smoked pork or smoked Morteau or Montbéliard sausages or a selection of pork products. Served alongside are often roasted or steamed potatoes or dumplings.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 The {{rationale}} {{for this study}} lies in the upsurge of home food preservation which has occurred {{as a result of}} the unprecedented rise in food prices and, concommitantly, the danger and economic loss entailed in the use of faulty methods. A sample of 200 non-urban homemakers in the province of Alberta who do food preservation were examined on their practices and knowledge with regard to <b>canning,</b> drying, making <b>sauerkraut,</b> pickling, smoking and root cellar storage. The demographic characteristics of the sample population were delineated as to age, education, income, and size of family still living at home. These general demographic differences were not reflected in the food preservation methods used, in general. Cookbooks, some of which may have been government bulletins, were the most important source of information followed by family and district home economists. Unsafe practices followed by these homemakers were the use by 12...|$|R
