Evidence is brought to the lab, placed on the <b>copy</b> <b>stand</b> and recorded. Some copy stands designed for forensic use have ultraviolet light sources on them, to illuminate latent fingerprints.|$|E
5000|$|The camera {{must be on}} a {{grounded}} platform, such as a <b>copy</b> <b>stand</b> or tripod. In general, {{the human}} body cannot stop natural vibrations with a camera shutter speed slower than 1/60 of a second. Using a grounded platform will allow the subject matter to be in complete focus.|$|E
50|$|Flat art {{was created}} by {{using a variety of}} {{standard}} graphic illustration techniques, using pen and ink, airbrush, paints, from clip art, colored paper, transfer lettering such as Letraset, and by copying from existing materials on a <b>copy</b> <b>stand</b> or on optical slide camera. Cel art, such as found in cel animation, was also used.|$|E

50|$|UCR/CMP Study Center Library and Roy McJunkin Imaging Center are {{interlinked}} research areas containing 10,000 photography monographs, manuscript materials, artists books, technical literature, exhibition catalogs, salon annuals {{and runs}} of photography periodicals, a <b>copy</b> <b>stand,</b> plus a {{full complement of}} expanding computer technology. International scholars, the education communities, and the museum staff utilize these research areas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} hardware {{used for}} herbarium specimen imaging is the [...] "HerbScan" [...] scanner. It is an inverted flat-bed scanner {{which raises the}} specimen up to the scanning surface. This technology was developed because it is standard practice to never turn a herbarium specimen upside-down. Alternatively, some herbaria employ a flat-bed book scanner or a <b>copy</b> <b>stand</b> {{to achieve the same}} effect.|$|E
50|$|In photography, a <b>copy</b> <b>stand</b> is {{a device}} used to copy images and/or text with a camera. The stand {{consists}} of a board onto which the media is placed and a tripod-mount parallel to it, usually with an adjustable height. Light is provided by bright lamps mounted {{on either side of}} the media at 45Â° angles. This provides uniform lighting and reduces specular reflection, keeping glare low.|$|E

50|$|A {{comprehensive}} set of close-up, macro and microphoto accessories {{was available}} for the F-1, including three bellows units, reversing rings and couplers, macro and micro photo hoods and couplers, <b>copy</b> <b>stands,</b> manual and automatic extension tubes and 3 different focal length macro lenses.|$|R
50|$|Numerous copies {{exist in}} museums and {{galleries}} around the world; {{one of the}} best-known <b>copies</b> <b>stands</b> outside the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas. The first FIFA World Cup trophy, commissioned in 1930 and designed by Abel Lafleur, was based on the model.|$|R
50|$|The Noddy {{video camera}} was {{servo-controlled}} {{to pan and}} tilt ('nod') across a matrix of pre-arranged physical objects - captions and mechanical models. The camera was black-and-white, with electronically synthesised colour added to its output. This system eliminated the delay associated with swapping graphics upon a conventional <b>copy</b> <b>stand.</b> It also allowed for the depth required by mechanical objects such as clocks and a rotating globe.|$|E
50|$|Contrary to {{its name}} (Digital Negative) the DNG format doesn't {{distinguish}} negative and positive data - all data {{is considered to be}} describing a positive image. While this is not an issue when working with images from digital cameras (which are always positive), working with scanned (by a film scanner or DSLR <b>copy</b> <b>stand)</b> film negatives saved as raw DNG files is complicated, because the resulted image is not automatically inverted and thus impossible to be used directly. A way to get around this is using an inverted curve in the photo editing application, however this reverses the effect of the image controls (Exposure, Shadow and Highlight details, etc) which complicates the photo editing.|$|E
50|$|The first {{attempts}} and prototypes {{were mostly}} simple video cameras on a <b>copy</b> <b>stand.</b> During the mid-1970s these were assembled and equipped with additional lighting {{to ensure that}} they were able to operate in darkened rooms, and also to provide a consistent quality of projected image. The technology of video cameras during this time, was a key factor in the development of document camera systems. Document cameras have also frequently benefited from developments in other industries, which also facilitated significant advances in the field of document camera technology. A good example of this is the technology used in photographic equipment, which has contributed much to the development of the document camera as a high quality presentation tool.|$|E
50|$|The House of the Faun in Pompei, {{dating from}} the 2nd century BCE, was so named because of the dancing faun statue that was the {{centerpiece}} of the large garden. The original now resides in the National Museum in Naples and a <b>copy</b> <b>stands</b> in its place.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Copy</b> <b>stands</b> can be {{used for}} {{reprography}} (that is, to copy documents). To do so, the camera is mounted, usually with a standard 1/4" [...] tripod-mount screw, onto the stand, pointing the lens down at the base, where the document to be copied would be placed.|$|R

"Early on, {{based on}} {{criteria}} including provenance, uniqueness, significance, condition, and need, the advisory group and consultants {{determined that the}} bulk of the 35mm slide collection should not be retained. Although the collection had been a rich, invaluable resource for teaching within AAP and related disciplines, many parts of the collection did not have significant original archival value. In other words, since the images consisted largely of surrogates of published materials (<b>copy</b> <b>stand</b> work), they had limited potential research use as primary historical documents. Whereas the completeness and local availability of the collection had previously been important for its function as a teaching collection, at this time the collection was evaluated cross-institutionally - which is common practice in special collections and increasingly common in visual resources collections. It was appraised based on the origin of the photographs and the availability of the images online or at other institutions. In addition, any slides recommended forarchival retention were considered with respect to their potential research use in future image based historical scholarship" ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Quick and {{accurate}} measurements of size distribution {{are essential to}} managing fragmented rock and other materials. WipFrag is an automated image based granulometry system that uses digital image analysis of rock photographs and video tape images to determine grain size distributions. WipFrag images can be digitized from fixed video cameras in the field, or using roving camcorders. Photographic images can be digitized from slides, prints or negatives, using a desktop <b>copy</b> <b>stand.</b> Digital images {{in a variety of}} formats, delivered on disk or over electronic networks, can be used. WipFrag uses powerful image analysis techniques to isolate the individual fragment boundaries. Edge detection is optimized by setting Edge Detection Variables (EDV). Manual editing can be used to improve the fidelity of edge detection. WipFrag has the facilities for zoom-merge analysis, where the combined analysis of images taken at different scales of observation can be used to overcome the size limitations inherent with a single image. Alternatively, an empirical calibration mode is available...|$|E

40|$|Students commencing {{science and}} {{engineering}} degrees at the Uni-versity of Wollongong are given mathematics skills tests {{in the first and}} fourth weeks of session. An evaluation of the results from these tests indicate that the majority of students 2 Ì 7 basic mathematical skills were insufficient to adequately support the prescribed first year math-ematics curriculum. To address this problem a pilot study was set up to develop video solutions. These solutions permit students to see the development of each solution in a step-by-step manner. An audio Contents C 935 commentary on each worked solution assists learning by providing stu-dents with an explanation of the developing solution. Two methods of video capture were investigated.

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{articles}} have described {{a process for}} the elimination of background from fingerprint and other images by subtracting the background. Two options, filtration and erasure, have been discussed. Channel subtraction, either in RGB (Red, Green, Blue) or HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) mode, can also be effected with variable results. There exists a fourth option: substituting another item of the same type in exact register to obtain a substitute background image for purposes of the subtraction. Equipment All images were captured with a Nikon Coolpix 995 digital camera on a <b>copy</b> <b>stand.</b> The images depicted herein were captured in JPEG format as 24 bit RGB images, for ease of transmission and publication, although TIFF is used for operational procedures. It is suggested that images be converted to gray scale after the subtraction has been done, although both options may be exercised to determine the optimum result in each case. All images were processed with the subtraction function of ImagePro (Version 4. 5. 1). This process is dependent on the userâs ability to accurately register the substitution image. Any software with this capability may be used...|$|E

Building strong culture through conservation, September 15 - 19, 2014, Melbourne, Australia. The RICH project (Reflectance Imaging for Cultural Heritage, KU Leuven) {{is developing a}} digital imaging tool for researching, studying, and exploring the material characteristics of graphic materials. With this imaging device, the visualization of {{the topography}} of medieval book illumination and bookbinding stamps can be monitored. The research project is surveying the possibilities of using the dome-imaging system to detect damage, the effects of old and recent restorations, and conservation treatments on medieval illuminated manuscripts and their bindings. The digital imaging device digitizes with omni-multidirectional lighting and exports the results to 2 -D+ and 3 -D. The technique is based on polynomial texture mapping, also known as reflectance transformation imaging (RTI), an imaging technique which interactively displays objects under varying lighting conditions to reveal surface phenomena. The module is a hemispherical structure with a single downward-facing video camera (28 million pixels) that can be mounted on a book conservation <b>copy</b> <b>stand</b> to secure manipulation during imaging. The RICH hardware is modular and can be transported to the research collections. The object to be captured {{is placed in the}} center and illuminated via computer-controllable lighting using multiple white LEDs. The different angles that illuminate the surface of the artifacts reveal extreme details. For each artifact, an image is taken by the overhead camera (a total of 260 images for each object). Filters in the visualization system are incorporated into the software. Fine details can be highlighted and measured up to 10 microns, bringing out structures that would not be visible under single illumination (with shade, contrast, sharpening, and sketch filters). status: publishe...|$|E
