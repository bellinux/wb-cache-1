40|$|Magnesium-based {{metallic}} glasses (MMGs) show intriguing potentials for application as implantable biomaterials owing to their disordered atomic structure, good biodegradability, low elastic modulus, high strength, and large elasticity. However, despite {{of all these}} advantages, their brittleness is their Achilles' heel, which severely limits their application as biomedical materials. In the current study, a significantly improved ductility of MMGs under bending and tensile loading through minor alloying with rare-earth element ytterbium (Yb) at an atomic concentration of 2 and 4 % is reported. The enhanced ductility is attributed to the increased density of shear bands close to fracture end and larger plastic zones on the fracture surface.

Photocrosslinkablepolyvinyl alcohol (PVA) with styrylpyridiniumpendent groups (SbQ) was used to produce nanofibres by the electrospin-ning process. A novel collector was designed to produce helically aligned fabric networks. Two main parameters of the electrospinning process, voltage and feed rate, were studied by inves-tigating their effects on the resultant morphology of the fibres. Operating parameters of 10 kV and 0. 2 ml/h were found to be suitable for production of PVA-SbQ nanofibres, with a 10 cm distance to the collector device.

Aberrant methylation of porcine OPN was frequently found in different tissues of somatic nuclear transferred cloning pigs, and bisulfite sequence data suggested that the OPN promoter region − 2615 to − 2239 nucleotides (nt) may be a crucial regulation DNA element.
