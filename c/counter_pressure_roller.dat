DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method {{for reducing the}} grain size in a massive, cylindrical workpiece, comprises rolling a <b>pressure</b> <b>roller</b> (2) over a circumference of the cylindrical workpieces and then delivering in radial direction of the cylindrical workpieces {{in such a way that}} the rolled <b>pressure</b> <b>roller</b> enters in a contact zone (4) in a surface near area of the workpieces and stretches the workpieces. The grain size in an edge area (6) that stretches itself from surface (5) of the workpiece to 4 % of output diameter of the cylindrical workpiece in the direction of the interior of the workpiece is reduced in comparison to the grain size in the workpiece interior. The grain size is reduced through the <b>pressure</b> <b>roller</b> in a flexing zone of the workpiece, coming from the surface of the workpiece up to 50 % of the output diameter of the cylindrical workpieces in the direction of the workpiece interior. The grain size in the edge area or in the flexing zone of the workpiece is reduced to equivalent diameter of less than 100 nm. The rolled <b>pressure</b> <b>roller</b> comprises a rotating bulge that penetrates in the contact zone in the surface near area of the workpiece and is formed through a pose (9) on the surface of the workpiece. The rotating bulge penetrates in the surface near area of the workpiece and has different diameter and different depth in the surface near area of the workpiece. The <b>pressure</b> <b>roller</b> and the workpiece are moved relative to each other in a feed direction that passes in axial direction of the cylindrical workpieces. The pose is shunted on the surface of the workpiece in the feed direction before the <b>pressure</b> <b>roller.</b> The diameter of the cylindrical workpiece is reduced through the <b>pressure</b> <b>roller</b> in the contact zone, and a diameter that corresponds to output diameter of the cylindrical workpiece adopts after passing through the <b>pressure</b> <b>roller.</b> An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a massive cylindrical workpiece.

40|$|A {{membrane}} can {{be represented}} by an energy landscape that solutes or colloids must cross. A model accounting for the momentum and the mass balances on the membrane energy landscape establishes {{a new way of}} writing for the Darcy law. The <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> in the Darcy law is no longer written as the result of an osmotic pressure difference but rather as a function of colloid-membrane interactions. Physically, the colloid-membrane interactions are slowing down the colloid velocity thus inducing a relative fluid-colloid motion that in turn leads to the <b>counter</b> <b>pressure.</b> The ability of the model to describe the physics of the filtration is discussed in detail. This model is solved on a simplified energy landscape to derive analytical relationships that describe the selectivity and the <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> from ab-initio operating conditions. The model shows that the stiffness of the energy landscape has an impact on the process efficiency: a gradual increase in interactions (like with hourglass pore shape) can reduce the separation energetic cost. It allows the introduction of a new paradigm to increase membrane efficiency: the accumulation that is inherent to the separation must be distributed across the membrane...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Owing to fluid pressure, the {{unsupported}} blank {{between the}} punch and the drawing ring is bulged {{in the direction}} opposite to the punch movement. The blank is thus drawn over a fluid cushion and does not contact the drawing ring profile radius. The bulge is hence advanta-geous for ensuring class A surface quality of the workpiece. The blank is stretched bi-axially in the bulged region owing to the acting fluid pressure. This can result in blank fracture at high-fluid <b>counter</b> <b>pressures.</b> High-fluid <b>counter</b> <b>pressures</b> are, however, necessary to achieve higher geometrical accuracies and lower springback. High pressure {{can also be used}} to transfer small contours from the punch to the drawn cup. A high-pressure die set for hydraulic bulging has been designed in order to emulate the bulge formation in hydromechanical deep drawing. A series of experiments have been carried out in order to determine the limiting bulge height for different sheet materials. Different punch diameters have been used to determine the influ-ence of drawing clearance on the limiting bulge height. The effect of fluid pressure on the smallest transferable radius has also been investigated. Results thus obtained can be used in determining the dedicated optimal <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> curve for a given workpiece geometry, material, and die set combination in order to design a robust computer-aided engineering (CAE) chain for the hydromechanical deep drawing process. Selected representative experi-mental results for hydromechanical deep drawing of complex part geometries have been shown. The <b>counter</b> <b>pressure</b> curve for hydromechanical deep drawing of the shown cups was selected in conformance to the allowable bulge height for the considered instantaneous sheet material, part shape, and process parameter combination...|$|R
