5|$|In May 2007, Npower {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new £2billion <b>clean</b> <b>coal</b> power station on the site. The proposed station would have generated electricity using three 800MW advanced supercritical steam, high-efficiency coal-fired units, giving the station a total generation capacity of 2,400MW. This was one of two new coal-fired stations proposed by Npower in the UK. The site was chosen because of its readily available proximity to the national grid, its rail and port links, and its position next to the North Sea, which is useful for both cooling water, and as a potential CO2 storage site, where CO2 could be piped to oil and gas wells, and saline aquifers.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{the station}} {{became one of}} the UK's least {{efficient}} power stations. In 1998, plans were announced to use the station as a test-bed for <b>clean</b> <b>coal</b> technology, but the plans did not come to fruition. In 1999, then owners Innogy plc decided to take Blyth A out of operation, while Blyth B began operating only at times of peak demand, because the stations had become surplus to their generating needs. From 1 April 2000 onwards the station was taken out of service for the summer months, because of the low demand for electricity at that time of year. However, staff were retained to maintain the station. Innogy plc then began looking for a buyer for the station, to decide the site's future. They had been in talks with American based NRG Energy, over a £410million purchase of the station, along with the Killingholme Power Station in North Lincolnshire. There had also been rumours that a deal had been made to convert the station into a waste-to-energy plant. However, any plans to save the station fell through and the generation of electricity at the station ceased on 31 January 2001, after 43years of operating, resulting in the loss of 131jobs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{samples of}} feed <b>coal,</b> <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal,</b> middlings, slime and gangue were {{collected}} from Xiqu, Antaibao and Heidaigou coal preparation plants, China. The analyses of minerals, ash, sulfur and 20 hazardous trace elements were performed on the samples by SEM/EDX, INAA, ICP-AES, CV-AAS, GAAS and also on the samples from experimental products (by heavy-media, electrostatic separation and forth-floatation). Partitioning of sulfur and these trace elements under the conditions of different coal ranks and coal preparation types were discussed. The {{results show that the}} partitioning behavior of a given element during the cleaning processes is mainly controlled by its modes of occurrence, the distribution forms of its carrier minerals and the cleaning technique types. Although hazardous trace elements have diverse degrees of removal due to different coal ranks and coal preparation types, the elements associated with fine minerals (e. g. Pb, U and Be) and organic constituents (e. g. Br and Cl) will not be effectively reduced by physical coal cleaning and may still be enriched in the <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal.</b> As to the coarse sized feeds (particle size > 0. 5 mm), the elements associated with coarse/epigenetic minerals can be removed more easily by gravity separation methods and report to the gangue and slime. As to the finer-grained feeds (< 0. 5 mm), the elements associated with minerals with a high dielectric coefficient are easily removed by electrostatic separation; in comparison with the larger-sized fractions (74 – 150 µm), the smaller-sized fractions (< 74 µm) show a high removability of elements by forth-floatation as a whole. The physical coal cleaning is not only effective in the removal of ash and sulfur, but also in reducing the concentration of most hazardous trace elements. However, as byproducts, the middlings, especially the slimes are preferentially enriched in many hazardous elements (e. g. Cr, Ni and Mo), so that these fractions have a potential of environmental risk and should not be directly used as fuel...|$|R

The effect of treating conditions, including {{the size of}} coal, treatment time, the ratio of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide and microwave radiation power on the rate of desulfurization were studied by single factor method. The result shows that 60.2  % total sulfur can be removed after treated under the conditions: microwave power 850  W, the concentration of coal slurry 3 / 50 (g/mL), the particle size of coal ≤ 0.23  mm, treatment time is 20  min and the ratio of acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide 1 : 1 (V/V). Taking acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide as oxygenant, the desulfurization experiments by microwave were carried out by Chen (2013). It is indicated that {{the ratio of the}} acetic acid and H 2 O 2 has great influence on desulfurization efficiency and <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal</b> yield. When the ratio is 1 : 2 (V/V), high desulfurization rate and the <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal</b> yield are obtained. At this ratio, desulfurization rate increases with irradiation time, while bonding index G extend rapidly to decline over time. Microwave desulfurization combined with peracetic acid can get high desulfurization rate, but the time of desulfurization should not be too long. XPS analysis shows that thiophene sulfur removal rate reached 46.03  % under the optimal oxidation conditions. Zhao et al. (2011) also pointed out that oxidant volume ratio has a great influence on desulfurization, and in his study under the condition of the optimal ratio 1 : 1, microwave power 700  W, irradiation time 120  s, the desulfurization rate is 49.19  %. Meanwhile with nitric acid as oxidant, desulfurization experiments by microwave were carried out (Zhao et al. 2011). 1  g of coal and 139  mL nitric acid of 1.4  mol were mixed together, then exposed to microwave with a frequency of 2, 450  MHz, power 700  W for 12  min, and the desulfurization rate of 47.1  % was achieved. In this process, oxidation takes place between pyrite and nitric acid, and sulfur oxides such as sulfate, SO 2 were produced, so as to achieve the purpose of removal of inorganic sulfur.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: China is a {{dominant}} energy consumer {{in a global}} context and current energy forecasts emphasise that China’s future energy consumption also will rely heavily on coal. The coal use is {{the major source of}} the greenhouse gas CO 2 and particles causing serious health damage. This paper looks into the question if coal washing might work as low cost strategy for both CO 2 and particle emission reductions. Coal washing removes dirt and rock from raw coal, resulting in a coal product with higher thermal energy and less air pollutants. Coal cleaning capacity has so far not been developed in line with the market potential. In this paper an emerging market for <b>cleaned</b> <b>coal</b> is studied within a CGE model for China. The macro approach catches the repercussions of coal cleaning through increased energy efficiency, lower coal transportation costs and crowding out effect of investments in coal washing plants. Coal cleaning stimulates economic growth and reduces particle emissions, but total energy use, coal use and CO 2 emissions increase through a rebound effect supported by the vast reserve of underemployed labourers. A carbon tax on fossil fuel combustion has a limited effect on total emissions. The reason is a coal leakage to tax exempted processing industries...|$|R

Although <b>clean</b> <b>coal</b> technologies could create power plants which supply grid power from coal without emitting significant amounts of such pollutants, the higher cost of the application of these technologies may increase the price of coal-generated electricity. The net effect on {{pollution is}} dependent on the fuel source of the electrical grid (fossil or renewable, for example) and the pollution profile of the power plants themselves. Identifying, regulating and upgrading single point pollution source such as a power plant—or replacing a plant altogether—may also be more practical.

The cleaning of coal by removing its unwanted sulfur and mineral matter components is utmost essential before their gainful utilizations. The ionic liquids (ILs) are considered as non-toxic solvents for using in different industrial processes. The effect of two ILs namely, 1 -n-butyl, 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoro borate (IL 1) and 1 -n-butyl, 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (IL 2) in oxidative de-sulfurization and de-ashing of two industrially important high sulfur coal samples from Meghalaya (India) is discussed in this paper. The maximum removal of total sulfur, pyritic sulfur, sulfate sulfur and organic sulfur are observed to be 37.36  %, 62.50  %, 83.33  % and 31.63  % respectively during this oxidative process. The quantitative diffuse reflectance Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy analysis supports the formation of sulfoxides (S=O) and sulfones (–SO 2) and their subsequent removal during the oxidation of the coals in presence of ILs. The X-ray fluorescence combined with near edge X-ray absorption fine structure and scanning electron microscopic studies reveal the removal of mineral matters (ash yields) from the coal samples.
