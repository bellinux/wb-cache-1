2500|$|One of {{the central}} tools in complex {{analysis}} is the line integral. The line integral around a <b>closed</b> <b>path</b> of a function that is holomorphic everywhere inside the area bounded by the <b>closed</b> <b>path</b> is always zero, {{which is what the}} Cauchy integral theorem states. The values of such a holomorphic function inside a disk can be computed by a path integral on the disk's boundary (as shown in Cauchy's integral formula). Path integrals in the complex plane are often used to determine complicated real integrals, and here the theory of residues among others is applicable (see methods of contour integration). A [...] "pole" [...] (or isolated singularity) of a function is a point where the function's value becomes unbounded, or [...] "blows up". If a function has such a pole, then one can compute the function's residue there, which can be used to compute path integrals involving the function; this is the content of the powerful residue theorem. The remarkable behavior of holomorphic functions near essential singularities is described by Picard's Theorem. Functions that have only poles but no essential singularities are called meromorphic. Laurent series are the complex-valued equivalent to Taylor series, but can be used to study the behavior of functions near singularities through infinite sums of more well understood functions, such as polynomials.|$|E

Based on this line of attack we suggest the method of analysis of NMR and use it for data treatment of the NMR in 2 D structure with doped barrier. There was shown that in structure investigated L (S) dependence is determined by the scattering anisotropy. The anomalous magnetoresistance which is observed at low temperature in "dirty " metals and semiconductors was provided by adequate explanation after creating the theory of the quantum correction to the conductivity [1, 2, 3]. The interference correction to the conductivity gives the main contribution to the NMR in 2 D structures at low temperatures. This correction arises from interference of the electron waves scattered along <b>closed</b> <b>paths</b> in opposite directions. In magnetic field perpendicular to the 2 D layer this interference is destroyed because of the phase shift between the correspondent amplitudes and thus leads to NMR. The existing theory of weak-field magnetoresistance is developed under condition kFl>> 1 (kF is the Fermi wave vector, l is the mean free path). In this case the quasiclassical treatment is valid and the interference correction to the conductivity can be written as sum of the contributions from <b>closed</b> <b>paths</b> [4...|$|R

[...] Thus, we are quickly led to the case where [...] has no boundary. [...] Sometimes it is impossible to remove the double-points via an isotopy—consider for example the figure-8 immersion of the circle in the plane.

[...] Once one has two opposite double points, one constructs a closed loop connecting the two, giving a <b>closed</b> <b>path</b> in [...] [...] Since [...] is simply connected, one can assume this path bounds a disc, and provided [...] one can further assume (by the weak Whitney embedding theorem) that the disc is embedded in [...] such that it intersects the image of [...] only in its boundary. Whitney then uses the disc to create a 1-parameter family of immersions, in effect pushing [...] across the disc, removing the two double points in the process. In the case of the figure-8 immersion with its introduced double-point, the push across move is quite simple (pictured). This process of eliminating opposite sign double-points by pushing the manifold along a disc is called the Whitney Trick.|$|E
2500|$|From {{experience}} by inertial scenarios (i.e. measurements in inertial frames), Langevin observers synchronize their clocks by standard Einstein convention or by slow clock synchronization, respectively (both internal synchronizations). For a certain Langevin observer this method works perfectly. Within its immediate vicinity clocks are synchronized and light propagates isotropic in space. But the experience when the observers try to synchronize their clocks along a <b>closed</b> <b>path</b> in space is puzzling: {{there are always}} at least two neighboring clocks which have different times. To remedy the situation, the observers agree on an external synchronization procedure (coordinate time t — or for ring-riding observers, a proper coordinate time for a fixed radius r). By this agreement, Langevin observers riding on a rigidly rotating disk will conclude from measurements of small distances between themselves that the geometry of the disk is non-Euclidean. [...] Regardless of which method they use, they will conclude that the geometry is well approximated by a certain Riemannian metric, namely the Langevin-Landau-Lifschitz metric. [...] This is in turn very well approximated by the geometry of the hyperbolic plane (with the negative curvatures -3ω2 and -3ω2r2, respectively). [...] But if these observers measure larger distances, they will obtain different results, depending upon which method of measurement they use! [...] In all such cases, however, they will most likely obtain results which are inconsistent with any Riemannian metric. In particular, if they use the simplest notion of distance, radar distance, owing to various effects such as the asymmetry already noted, they will conclude that the [...] "geometry" [...] of the disk is not only non-Euclidean, it is non-Riemannian.|$|E

40|$|Milgram Condition {{proposed}} by Aoyama et al. {{plays an important}} role on the analysis of "six degrees of separation". We have shown that the relations between Milgram condition and the generalized clustering coefficient, which was introduced as an index for measuring the number of <b>closed</b> <b>paths</b> by us, are absolutely different in scale free networks (Barabasi and Albert) and small world networks (Watts and Strogatz, Watts). This fact implies that the effect of <b>closed</b> <b>paths</b> on information propagation is different in both networks. In this article, we first investigate the difference and pursuit what is a crucial mathematical quantity for information propagation. As a result we find that a sort of "disorder" plays more important role for information propagation than partially <b>closed</b> <b>paths</b> included in a network. Next we inquired into it in more detail by introducing two types of intermediate networks. Then we find that the average of the local clustering coefficient and the generalized clustering coefficients $C_{(q) }$ have some different functions and important meanings, respectively. We also find that $C_{(q) }$ is close to the propagation of information on networks. Lastly, we show that realizability of six degrees of separation in networks can be understood in a unified way by disorder. Comment: 14 pages, 12 figures, Fig 4 is added correctl...|$|R
