40|$|We studied {{different}} {{populations of}} Mioscirtus wagneri (Kittary, 1859) in Spain assigned to subspecies maghrebi by Fernandes (1968) and obtained some new {{records for the}} species. To see if maghrebi is a consistent taxon for the Iberian populations, we performed a morphometric analysis involving 53 individuals from different origins considering body size (front of the head to tip of the abdomen); the shape of pronotum and presence of a second anterior notch or sulcus; length of the antennae and epiphallum, according to the characters used to define subspecies maghrebi. If maghrebi is consistent, we would expect intermediate sizes between wagneri and rogenhoferi, the other two well separated subspecies considered for M. w. However, in our measurements we obtained that body size is not intermediate between M. w. wagneri and M. w. rogenhoferi contrary to expectations if assuming the existence of maghrebi. Body size is similar to wagneri and further, we recorded some of the smallest individuals described so far. Also, the pronotum varied widely across and within populations showing different phenotypes that formerly were used to separate maghrebi and wagneri. Taking into account body size, pronotum, length of antenna and epiphallum, we think that differences between the studied Spanish populations and wagneri form are not enough to assign the studied populations to maghrebi. In the studied area, M. w. shows a narrow ecological niche inhabiting shores or proximities of hipersaline lagoons wherever Suaeda vera (Forsskål 1791, <b>Chenopodiacea)</b> is present, M. w. uses this plant as refuge and food. The species also inhabits bare saline low grounds with scattered S vera. It presents a markedly discontinuous and patchy distribution in Spain, showing up punctually, where the microhabitat is appropriate. We obtained a morphometric variability with a significant association between body size and locality, and between body size and the colour of posterior wings in males. Because of its wide range disjunction, its discontinuous regional distribution and morphological variability, we believe that M. w. is an interesting species to investigate possible substructuring of populations in which we probably may recognize ecological forms or varieties that deserve deeper and further study. Estudiamos distintas poblaciones de Mioscirtus wagneri (Kittary, 1859), considerado como M. w. maghrebi por Fernandes (1968) en España, con algunas nuevas citas para la especie. Para dilucidar si el taxón maghrebi es consistente en nuestras poblaciones, realizamos un análisis morfométrico de 53 ejemplares considerando los mismos caracteres utilizados para establecer dicha subespecie, a citar: tamaño del cuerpo, relieve y forma del pronoto, longitud de la antena y forma del epifalo. El tamaño de los individuos de nuestras poblaciones no es intermedio entre las formas conocidas de M. w. wagneri y M. w. rogenhoferi Saussuare, 1888, como cabría esperar asumiendo la existencia de maghrebi. Nuestras poblaciones no se apartan del tamaño de wagneri e incluso encontramos las menores tallas descritas para este taxón. El relieve del pronoto, y en particular la presencia de un segundo surco, el anterior, es muy variable abarcando en una misma población fenotipos dispares utilizados anteriormente para separar las formas maghrebi y wagneri. Las diferencias entre el tamaño del cuerpo, el pronoto, la longitud de la antena y la forma del epifalo no nos parecen suficientes para asignar como maghrebi al conjunto de las poblaciones estudiadas y separarlas de la subespecie nominada wagneri. M. w. es una especie de requerimientos ecológicos muy restringidos. La hemos encontrado a orillas de lagunas hipersalinas y siempre dependiendo de Suaeda vera (Forsskål, 1791) <b>Chenopodiacea</b> que utiliza como refugio y alimento, en particular en suelos desnudos y salitrosos donde predominan manchas de esa planta. Su distribución regional es marcadamente discontinua y muy puntual, presentándose allí donde el hábitat le es propicio. Aunque el análisis es preliminar, encontramos una variabilidad morfométrica y una asociación del tamaño corporal con la localidad, y del tamaño corporal con la coloración de las alas posteriores en los machos. Debido a su distribución geográfica disjunta, localmente discontinua, y a la variabilidad morfométrica encontrada en sus poblaciones, creemos que M. w. es una especie interesante para investigar la posible subestructuración de sus poblaciones en las cuales es posible se reconozcan diversas formas o variedades ecológicas lo que merece mayor investigación...|$|R

In this preliminary classification, the Amaranthaceae s.l. are divided into 10 subfamilies with approximately 180 genera and 2,500 species.|$|E
25|$|In the APG II {{system of}} 2003 (unchanged from the APG system of 1998), {{the family is}} placed in the order Caryophyllales.

25|$|The plant {{communities}} that are found with G. kennedyana have not been sufficiently studied. However, it is currently known to be found with the spiny fan-flower (Scaevola spinescens), whitewood (Atalaya hemiglauca), Acacia and Eremophila species and occasionally black oak (Casuarina pauper). A low ground cover of <b>chenopodiaceae</b> is often present.|$|E
25|$|Amaranthaceae is a {{widespread}} and cosmopolitan family from the tropics to cool temperate regions. The Amaranthaceae (sensu stricto) are predominantly tropical, whereas the former <b>Chenopodiaceae</b> have their centers of diversity in dry temperate and warm temperate areas. Many of the species are halophytes, tolerating salty soils, or grow in dry steppes or semi-deserts.|$|E
25|$|The family Amaranthaceae {{was first}} {{published}} in 1789 by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in Genera Plantarum, p.87–88. The first publication of family <b>Chenopodiaceae</b> was in 1799 by Étienne Pierre Ventenat in Tableau du Regne Vegetal, 2, p.253. The older name has priority and is now the valid scientific name of the extended Amaranthaceae (s.l. = sensu lato).|$|E
25|$|With around 800 {{species that}} are C4 plants, the Amaranthaceae {{represent}} the largest group with this photosynthesis pathway among the eudicots (which collectively includes about 1,600 C4 species). Within the family, several types of C4-photosynthesis occur, and about 17 different types of leaf anatomy are realized. Therefore, this photosynthesis pathway seems to have developed about 15 times independently during {{the evolution of the}} family. About two-thirds of the C4 species belong to the former <b>Chenopodiaceae.</b> The first occurrence of C4-photosynthesis dates from the early Miocene, about 24 million years ago, but in some groups, this pathway evolved much later, about 6 (or less) million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The Euphrates {{flows through}} a number of {{distinct}} vegetation zones. Although millennia-long human occupation {{in most parts of the}} Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a xeric woodland. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various oaks, pistachio trees, and Rosaceae (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and Rosaceae. Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals, including einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, oat and rye. South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodland-steppe vegetation. Between Raqqa and the Syro–Iraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba) and <b>Chenopodiaceae.</b> Throughout history, this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of sheep and goat pastoralism by its inhabitants. Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true desert. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of <b>Chenopodiaceae</b> or Poa sinaica. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference, research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a riverine forest. Species characteristic of this type of forest include the Oriental plane, the Euphrates poplar, the tamarisk, the ash and various wetland plants.|$|E
25|$|Vegetation in {{the region}} includes, firs, oaks, conifers, platanus, willow, olive trees, poplar, hawthorn, oriental plane, cherry plum, rose hips, {{pistachio}} trees, rosaceae, pear, mountain ash poplar. The desert in the south is mostly steppe and would feature xeric plants such as palm trees, tamarix, date palm, fraxinus, poa, white wormwood and <b>chenopodiaceae.</b> Animals found {{in the region}} include the Syrian brown bear, wild boar, gray wolf, golden jackal, Indian crested porcupine, red fox, goitered gazelle, Eurasian otter, striped hyena, Persian fallow deer, onager, mangar and the Euphrates softshell turtle. Bird species include, the see-see partridge, Menetries's warbler, western jackdaw, hooded crow, European nightjar, rufous-tailed scrub robin, masked shrike and the pale rockfinch.|$|E
25|$|In the spring, {{a female}} nymph (also {{known as a}} stem mother) emerges from an {{overwintering}} egg and initiates a gall {{on one of the}} leaves of the Populus tree. The gall forms around the stem mother, who begins to reproduce parthenogenically while feeding on the leaf's phloem sap. Each stem mother is capable of creating up to 300 progeny per gall. The gall occupants develop wings {{in the middle of the}} summer and disperse from the gall to deposit their larvae in the ground. These larvae colonize and feed on the roots of nearby <b>Chenopodiaceae</b> plants for the rest of the summer. In the summer, they form alate migrants that fly back to the Populus tree and asexually produce sexual males and females whose sole purpose is to mate, as they lack mouthparts to feed. The product of sexual reproduction is a single egg in each female which is deposited in the tree's bark and left to overwinter.|$|E
500|$|While {{convergent}} {{evolution is}} often illustrated with animal examples, {{it has often}} occurred in plant evolution. For instance, C4 photosynthesis, {{one of the three}} major carbon-fixing biochemical processes, has arisen independently up to 40 times. About 7,600 plant species of angiosperms use [...] carbon fixation, with many monocots including 46% of grasses such as maize and sugar cane, and dicots including several species in the <b>Chenopodiaceae</b> and the Amaranthaceae.|$|E
