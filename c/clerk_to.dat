This Edmund Clerke was the Sheriff of Hampshire and <b>clerk</b> <b>to</b> the Signet in 1671. Clerke the younger married the daughter of Giles Frampton, who took control of the manor after Clerke's death and sold it to Edmund Dummer, a former Surveyor of the Navy, in 1705.|$|E

5|$|Following the restoration, William Bruce was {{appointed}} <b>Clerk</b> <b>to</b> the Bills in 1660, and Clerk of Supply to the Lords in Council in 1665.

5|$|In 2004, Newsom gained {{national}} attention when he directed the San Francisco city–county <b>clerk</b> <b>to</b> issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, {{in violation of}} the then-current state law.

5|$|Neville was a royal <b>clerk</b> <b>to</b> King John in {{the spring}} of 1207, and in December of that year was at Marlborough Castle on royal business. Earlier {{references}} to a Ralph Neville who in 1207 delivered items to Hugh de Neville, or the Ralph Neville who was the same Hugh de Neville's chaplain, may be to the future bishop, but the evidence is inconclusive. Hugh de Neville and Neville subsequently worked together, and corresponded on both business and personal affairs. Both men claimed the other as a kinsman.|$|E
5|$|The Massachusetts popular party gained {{ground in}} the May 1766 elections. Adams was re-elected to the House and {{selected}} as its clerk, in which position {{he was responsible for}} official House papers. In the coming years, Adams used his position as <b>clerk</b> <b>to</b> great effect in promoting his political message. Joining Adams in the House was John Hancock, a new representative from Boston. Hancock was a wealthy merchant—perhaps the richest man in Massachusetts—but a relative newcomer to politics. He was initially a protégé of Adams, and he used his wealth to promote the Whig cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{publication of the}} proceedings by the <b>clerk</b> <b>to</b> the court, Thomas Potts, in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster, {{and the number of}} witches hanged together – nine at Lancaster and one at York – make the trials unusual for England at that time. It has been estimated that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions; this series of trials accounts for more than two per cent of that total.|$|E

5|$|At {{the height}} of the civil war during Stephen's reign, and shortly after Chesney's consecration, the bishop acted as a {{guarantor}} for the treaty between Ranulf de Gernon, the Earl of Chester, and Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, drawn up to limit the fighting between the two earls during the civil war. Chesney was present at the legatine council held by Theobald in March 1151, {{and was one of the}} judges, along with Theobald and Hilary of Chichester, the Bishop of Chichester, in a dispute between the monks of Belvoir Priory and a secular clerk over the right of the <b>clerk</b> <b>to</b> a church. Chesney appointed the future Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, to a prebend in his cathedral chapter during the latter part of Stephen's reign.|$|E

Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph from {{stealing}} from the Natural History Museum, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of meditation to stop a deforestation project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of Grand Theft Scratchy in Springfield, although Lisa points out it is ironic she used violence to stop a violent game.|$|E
5|$|Beckingham at {{the time}} he was {{mentioned}} in 1258 was working, probably as chief clerk, for Gilbert of Preston, the English crown's senior royal justice. This was an itinerant position, travelling in a circuit (or eyre); Gilbert's last eyre–and therefore also Beckingham's as his chief clerk–was that of 1268–72. In 1274, Beckingham himself was named an itinerant justice for Middlesex, although as yet this was not a permanent position and he was replaced by the next year. At this time he seems to have held the rank of king's serjeant. He received the commission of justice of assize in 1276. From 1273 to 1278, he was a senior <b>clerk</b> <b>to</b> the Court of Common Pleas, and was then made keeper of the writs and rolls of the court (custos rotulorum et brevium de banco) until 1285. In that year, Beckingham was appointed a Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|E
