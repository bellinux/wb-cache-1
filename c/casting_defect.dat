5000|$|A simple {{vertical}} crack with {{a freshly}} fractured surface and old rust {{marks on the}} face was easily distinguished {{to the side of}} the centre joint, extending from the bottom flange to the top of the girder. This was associated with a <b>casting</b> <b>defect</b> hidden behind a surface skin of sound metal at the thickest part of the section where the flanges met the web. This was described by the accident report as a large honeycomb, or drawhole, which measured 3½ ins (c 90 mm) across at the face, and narrowed to about l½ ins (c 40 mm). inside , 2⅜ ins (c 60 mm) in extreme depth and 6ins (c 150 mm). in extreme length, extending inwards and downwards ...but not within 1 ½ ins of the outer face of the joint flange. The total capacity of the hole, measured by filling it with water, was 15 ½ cubic inches (about 250 ml) and, as the metal immediately round the hole was not sound, this amount does not measure the actual extent of the flaw. [...] There were other signs of poor foundry practice when the girder had been cast; honeycombing elsewhere, a cold shut (incomplete fusion between different streams of filling metal), and residual stresses in the girder web (as a consequence of which, when sample cores were being drilled for testing, the web (but not the flanges) fractured along the line of holes. Whilst the metal appeared to be of good quality to the naked eye, the tested tensile strength of the metal varied widely from the lowest of ~4.5 tsi (c 70 MPa) (close to the honeycombing) with a mean of 7.5 tsi (c 115 MPa).The accident report says that the girder if sound would have had a breaking strength of 80 tons and concludes that the theoretical strength of the girder was ‘above but only just above’ the Board of Trade requirement (live load x 6 + dead load x 3) (However this appears inconsistent with the figures quoted by the report for dead weight (21 ton shared between 2 girders) and live load (21 ton shared between two girders))The actual strength fell below this because of the casting defect; [...] "The sectional area of the bottom flange would at one place be reduced from 36 (sq) ins to only 28 (sq) ins, thus enormously reducing the strength of the girder" ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Casting {{simulation}} helps visualize mold {{filling and}} casting solidification; predict related defects like cold shut, shrinkage porosity and hard spots; and optimize the casting design {{to achieve the}} desired quality with high yield. Flow and solidification of molten metals is however, a very complex phenomenon {{that is difficult to}} simulate correctly by conventional computational techniques, especially when the part geometry is intricate and the required inputs ((like thermo-physical properties and heat transfer coefficients) are not available. For industrial application, we need alternate approaches that are fast, reliable and user-friendly.

40|$|AbstractCasting defects such as gas pores and shrinkages {{typically}} {{occur during}} casting process. These casting defects affect fatigue crack initiation and strongly dominate fatigue strength. Particularly, {{in a large}} scale component, the molten metal flow is complicated and the cooling rate is dependent on the locations, which affect the formation of casting defects. In the present study, rotating bending fatigue tests of cast aluminum alloy A 356 were conducted using the specimens sampled at three locations of a large scale component where the cooling rates were different. The fatigue limit was predicted based on the statistics of <b>casting</b> <b>defect</b> size and compared with the experimental results.
