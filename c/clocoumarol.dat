40|$|After {{intraperitoneal}} injection of <b>clocoumarol</b> (DB 112), a new antivitamin K, into female rats, plasma levels were determined spectrophotometrically and followed for 24 hr. The kinetics were biphasic. After administration of proadifen, the second, slower phase was prolonged. On the other hand, proadifen potentiated the anticoagulant effect of <b>clocoumarol.</b> These results {{are compatible with}} the known inhibitory action of proadifen on biotransformation.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of <b>clocoumarol,</b> 3 -[1 -[p-(2 -chloroethyl) phenyl]butyl]- 4 -hydroxycoumarin, by rat liver microsomes was investigated. The {{chemical structure}} of the main metabolite is 6 -[1 -hydroxy- 2 -oxo- 3 -[p-(2 -chloroethyl) phenyl]hexylidene]- 2, 4 -cyclohexadien- 1 - one; such a structure has not been previously reported for metabolites from anticoagulants of the 4 -hydroxycoumarin group.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of <b>clocoumarol,</b> a new synthetic vitamin K antagonist by rat liver microsomes, was investigated. A new metabolic route, {{different from}} the hydroxylation of the coumarin ring, has been explored. It {{led to the formation}} of several metabolites (m 1, m 2, m 3) with an open coumarin cycle. A quantitative and kinetic study of the in vitro formation of the main metabolite (m 1) has been performed. An original dosage method of metabolite m 1 based on high performance liquid chromatography, has been developed. The optimal conditions for metabolite m 1 formation by rat liver microsomes has been determined : 30 min. incubation time, 37 Â° C, 13, 6 mg of microsomal proteins. A kinetic study, analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk plot, has been performed and the kinetic constants, K(m) and V(max), estimated. The quantitative study indicated that 10 % of clocourmarol was metabolized by this new metabolic route. The stimulatory effect of phenobarbital on <b>clocoumarol</b> metabolism has been shown. Treatment of the rats with phenobarbital caused a two-fold increase in metabolite m 1 formation. These results indicate that the mixed-function oxidase system of microsomes is involved.
