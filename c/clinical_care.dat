It also {{raises the question of whether}} the results of clinical trials using one population can invariably be applied elsewhere. There are both social and physical differences: Goldacre asks whether patients diagnosed with depression in China are really the same as patients diagnosed with depression in California, and notes that people of Asian descent metabolize drugs differently from Westerners.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for <b>clinical</b> <b>care</b> at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics.

Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. Tic disorders in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E

40|$|Background/purpose: Hospital {{accreditation}} in Taiwan {{was begun}} in 1978, but dental departments {{were not included}} until much later. In 2007 – 2008, a field survey of dental departments of hospitals was carried out. The purposes {{of the study were}} to understand the overall conditions of <b>clinical</b> dental <b>care</b> of hospital dental departments in hospitals in Taiwan, and produce criteria for <b>clinical</b> dental <b>care.</b> Materials and methods: In 2007 – 2008, a questionnaire survey (evaluation form) about <b>clinical</b> dental <b>care</b> criteria was mailed to 165 dental departments in Taiwan. After the questionnaires were mailed back, a field survey of dental departments of these hospitals was carried out. A field visit was made to each hospital to check the answers on the questionnaire. The survey return rate was 62 %. This research examined 36 of 93 criteria concerned with <b>clinical</b> dental <b>care,</b> and the results were analyzed. Scores of the criteria in the questionnaire (evaluation form) were on a five-point scale, from high to low: A = totally achieved, B = above the average standard, C = the average standard, D = below the average standard, and E = not suitable. The percentages of A–E were analyzed according to the location of the dental department (i. e., in a medical center, regional hospital, or district hospital), then for every respective criterion, and finally for the entire dataset. Results: For total <b>clinical</b> dental <b>care,</b> 53 % medical centers received an A, 42 % of regional hospitals received a B, and 48 % of district hospitals received a C. The overall average was B (35 %). Percentages above C were 99 % of medical centers, 88 % of regional hospitals, and 76 % of district hospitals. Conclusion: For overall <b>clinical</b> dental <b>care</b> in hospital dental departments in Taiwan, the results of this research show that medical centers are superior to regional hospitals, which are better than district hospitals. The criteria used in the study can be taken as references for dental department accreditation in hospitals in the future...|$|R

25|$|The enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) is {{responsible}} for various activation and deactivation steps in azathioprine's mechanism of action. The first metabolic step that azathioprine undergoes in the body is the conversion to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP; see Pharmacokinetics), which is itself an immunosuppressant prodrug. The TPMT enzyme {{is responsible}}, in part, for the methylation of 6-MP into the inactive metabolite 6-methylmercaptopurine - this methylation prevents 6-MP from further conversion into active, cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. Certain genetic variations within the TPMT gene can lead to decreased or absent TPMT enzyme activity, and individuals who are homozygous or heterozygous for these types of genetic variations may have increased levels of TGN metabolites and {{an increased risk of}} severe bone marrow suppression (myelosuppression) when receiving azathioprine. In many ethnicities, TPMT polymorphisms that result in decreased or absent TPMT activity occur with a frequency of approximately 5%, meaning that about 0.25% of patients are homozygous for these variants. However, an assay of TPMT activity in red blood cells or a TPMT genetic test can identify patients with reduced TPMT activity, allowing for the adjustment of azathioprine dose or avoidance of the drug entirely. The FDA-approved drug label for azathioprine recommends testing for TPMT activity to identify patients at risk for myelotoxicity. Indeed, testing for TPMT activity is currently one of the few examples of pharmacogenetics being translated into routine <b>clinical</b> <b>care.</b> Missense SNP in NUDT15 (e.g., rs116855232, inducing R139C)) has been identified to be a causal factor for AZA-induced leukopenia through a genome wide association study (GWAS) in East Asians.|$|E

40|$|Background: Caring is {{the core}} of nursing and should be {{cultivated}} in student nurses. However, there are serious concerns about the caring concern in the clinical environment and in nursing education. Clinical instructors are ideally positioned to care for student nurses so that they in turn, can learn to care for their patients. Methods: A descriptive, comparative, cross-sectional and correlational quantitative research design with convenience sampling was conducted to describe the perceptions of junior student nurses (n =  148) and senior student nurses (n =  168) regarding <b>clinical</b> instructor <b>caring.</b> A structured self administered questionnaire using the Nursing Student Perceptions of Instructor Caring (NSPIC) (Wade & Kasper, 2006) was used. Descriptive statistics and hypotheses testing using parametric and non parametric methods were conducted. The reliability of the NSPIC was determined.

40|$|Abstract: Caring is {{developed}} in student nurses by learning to {{care in a}} caring environment, emulating caring behaviours, and having caring relationships with the health team and facilitators of learning. International concerns about uncaring nursing {{have resulted in the}} clinical environment in which student nurses are supposed to learn to care, to not be conducive to cultivating <b>caring</b> nurses. <b>Clinical</b> instructors have close contact with student nurses during clinical placement and are positioned ideally to care for students, so that they, in turn, can learn to care for patients. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate and examine the perceptions of student nurses of <b>clinical</b> instructor <b>caring</b> at a private nursing education institution in South Africa. A descriptive, comparative, cross-sectional and correlational quantitative research design was used to describe the perceptions of student nurses of <b>clinical</b> instructor <b>caring</b> at the institution, and to determine and examine the relationships between the perceptions and the years of formal nursing education successfully completed, frequency of clinical instructor contact and age of the student nurses. The total accessible population size was N = 347, comprising N = 148 junior student nurses and N = 199 senior student nurses. Convenience sampling was used. The acceptance rate was n = 122 (82 %) and n = 168 (85 %) for the junior- and senior student nurses respectively. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data, including the Nursing Student Perceptions of Instructor Caring (NSPIC) instrument. Descriptive statistics analysis, hypothesis testing, and reliability testing was conducted. The findings revealed that respondents had a positive perception of their <b>clinical</b> instructors’ <b>caring.</b> Statistical relationships could not be found between the years of formal nursing education successfully completed, the frequency of contact with a clinical instructor, the ages of the respondents and their perceptions of <b>clinical</b> instructor <b>caring.</b> Reliability testing revealed that the NSPIC was reliable if one item each from two of the subscales were removed. The findings of this study contribute towards the knowledge of student perceptions of <b>clinical</b> instructor <b>caring,</b> specifically from a South African private nursing education perspective, and could contribute towards further research on this important nursing education theme. Furthermore, the findings could be used in theory development, in support of a theory, and in designing a model of <b>clinical</b> instructor <b>caring</b> in the future. M. Cur...|$|R
