There are the remains of extensive quarries on the upper slopes of Warnscale, including Dubs, once served by a tramway from the summit of Honister Pass.

25|$|In 2008, Savcor (a {{company which}} specialises in {{restoration}} techniques for concrete and steel) was contracted to do a detailed survey of His Majesty's Theatre. This survey revealed {{a number of}} defects on the facades that potentially rendered it unsafe. In 2010, a project involving the restoration of damaged cornices and corbels was carried out. Damaged decorations were replaced by using modern repair mortars which produced perfect reproductions. Mick Summers {{was in charge of}} crafting the ornate flowers around the façade. This was achieved with the help of latex moulds which were taken from the original form. Due to structural deterioration, many of the balconies had to be rebuilt completely. The balconies' many features, including clamshell base, <b>curved</b> <b>profile</b> and plaster features, required many different processes to recreate the original. Both latex moulding and traditional construction techniques were used to make sure the balconies remained durable.|$|E
500|$|The boiler was enveloped by Bulleid's air-smoothed sheet-steel casing, {{which was}} not for the {{purposes}} of streamlining, as demonstrated by the extremely flat front end, but as a way of lifting exhaust gases. [...] The flat sides were also an aid to cleaning the locomotive with mechanical carriage washers, representing an attempt to reduce labour costs. [...] It followed the profile of the Belpaire firebox and extended to a <b>curved</b> <b>profile</b> forward of the smokebox front. [...] Spun glass mattresses were used for boiler lagging. [...] The smokebox was a sheet metal fabrication to the same profile as the firebox, acting as a former to maintain the shape of the air-smoothed casing. [...] In between, the casing was supported by channel-section steel crinolines (strengtheners used to maintain the shape) attached to the frames. [...] The smokebox housed the five-nozzle Lemaître blastpipe arranged in a circle within a large-diameter chimney.|$|E

AS expressed {{the amount of}} <b>curve</b> <b>profile</b> area of Y phase in the unit containing surface area, S(X). The test methods and formulas were deduced, e. g. : AS=ICI /IC=LCI /BC. In the formula, ICI and IC indicated the intersection numbers of test line with <b>curve</b> intercepts (or <b>profiles</b> in 2 D) and with the containing curve respectively. BC denoted the length of containing curve, LCI being the length of curve intercepts. The formula means that AS are equal to the curve intercept density and equal to the <b>curve</b> <b>profile</b> intersection density in surface. Issues about AS application and its correction for shrinking tissues were discussed. Example for testing AS was given...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In curve design, {{controlling}} the macroscopic feature {{that emerges from}} the combinations of shape elements is important. However, {{controlling the}} macroscopic feature is difficult using conventional microscopic shape- information such as dimension and curvature. Therefore, in curve design, a design-support system that uses macroscopic shape- information to represent the macroscopic feature is desired. In the our past study, the information entropy calculated by the discrete curvature function as Markov Process was found to represent the complexity of basic <b>curved</b> <b>profiles</b> described by three-dimensional Bézier curve. Besides, it was showed {{the effectiveness of the}} information entropy as a shape-generation index. However, the existence of the <b>curved</b> <b>profiles</b> that the information entropy is difficult to apply was pointed out. The objective of the present study is to show that the total absolute curvature as macroscopic shape- information that represents the complexity of diverse <b>curved</b> <b>profiles.</b> Firstly, the total absolute curvature was applied to the basic <b>curved</b> <b>profiles.</b> The relationship between the total absolute curvature and complexity was analyzed. As a result, the total absolute curvature was found to represent the complexity as well as the information entropy. Secondly, the information entropy and the total absolute curvature were applied to the <b>curved</b> <b>profiles</b> of automobile side-views described by three-dimensional Bézier curve. As a result, the information entropy was found to be difficult to apply. On the other hand, the total absolute curvature was found to represent the complexity. In the present study, it was showed that the total absolute curvature represents the complexity of diverse <b>curved</b> <b>profiles</b> comparing with the information entropy...|$|R

500|$|The basic {{layout of}} the class was {{influenced}} by the existing ‘’Lord Nelson’’ class 4-6-0 design, but the use of the round topped firebox enabled Maunsell to design the cab's <b>curved</b> <b>profile</b> to fit the gauge restrictions of the Hastings line while allowing adequate forward visibility. The short frame length of the 4-4-0 locomotive also meant very little overhang on the line's tight curves. To maintain the high power rating required for express passenger engines, Maunsell opted for a three-cylinder design. In terms of tractive effort, the class was the most powerful 4-4-0 ever built in Britain, and were the only 4-4-0 type to be given the power classification of 5P by British Railways. They were well liked by crews. They also had a higher tractive effort than the nominally more powerful King Arthur class 4-6-0s, but at the cost of high axle-loading: [...] The permanent way on the Hastings line therefore had to be upgraded during 1929 and 1930 to accept the new locomotive.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} track Listeria monocytogenes strains involved in outbreaks {{is essential for}} control and prevention of listeriosis. Because current typing techniques are time-consuming, cost-intensive, technically demanding, and difficult to standardize, we developed a rapid and cost-effective method for typing of L. monocytogenes. In all, 172 clinical L. monocytogenes isolates and 20 isolates from culture collections were typed by high-resolution melting (HRM) curve analysis of a specific locus of the internalin B gene (inlB). All obtained HRM <b>curve</b> <b>profiles</b> were verified by sequence analysis. The 192 tested L. monocytogenes isolates yielded 15 specific HRM <b>curve</b> <b>profiles.</b> Sequence analysis revealed that these 15 HRM <b>curve</b> <b>profiles</b> correspond to 18 distinct inlB sequence types. The HRM <b>curve</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained correlated with the five phylogenetic groups I. 1, I. 2, II. 1, II. 2, and III. Thus, HRM curve analysis constitutes an inexpensive assay and represents an improvement in typing relative to classical serotyping or multiplex PCR typing protocols. This method provides a rapid and powerful screening tool for simultaneous preliminary typing of up to 384 samples in approximately 2 hours...|$|R

After researching the status of the rotary power head, we invented a new decelerator—roulette <b>curve</b> <b>profile</b> movable tooth transmission, and applied it in cutting drill, we presented the rotary power head with roulette <b>curve</b> <b>profile</b> movable tooth transmission. The moving components, such as the input shaft and the output shaft, of the roulette <b>curve</b> <b>profile</b> movable tooth transmission are self-balance, so the transmission can bring about random tooth number difference. Analyzing the principle of the transmission, we create the three-dimensional modeling by using Solidworks 2010. The rotary power head with the new transmission installed is convenient in assembling and disassembling, transferring bigger torque, having a relatively small radial dimension, suitable for heavy-loaded rock drill machine...|$|R

Using the beta-adrenoceptor mediated chronotropic responses of the guinea-pig isolated right atrial preparation we have investigated the consequences of experimental [Ro] and KE variation.
