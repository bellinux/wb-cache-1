Complicated tax laws and high tax rales have long eroded the ability of United States companies to remain competitive on a global scale. During the past two years, tax reform has been elevated to the Presidential and Congressional levei. Because these reform efforts have stalled, however, and in the constant search for ways to become more competitive and profitable, United States dorniciled companies have begun to more aggressively explore <b>corporate</b> <b>inversion.</b> This case study of Walgreens Alliance Boots and Mylan N.

40|$|The {{following}} dissertation {{is structured}} as two related essays on tax systems and corporate tax avoidance. The first essay {{focuses on the}} firm level impact of a government’s transition from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system. Utilizing a case study approach, ten firms within the tax jurisdiction of the United Kingdom are analyzed pre- and post-transition. Firm behavior is evaluated pre- and post-transition through firm level incentives to shift earnings and firm level utilization of tax havens (i. e. subsidiaries located in tax advantageous areas). Despite significant efforts put forth by governments to reduce corporate tax avoidance and tax haven utilization, case study findings reveal little evidence that territorial tax systems promote such firm behavior. The second essay focuses on the firm level change in share value, and the associated return to holding such shares, for firms that engage in <b>corporate</b> <b>inversion.</b> Cumulative abnormal returns are reviewed {{for a set of}} inverting firms to determine whether shareholders value <b>corporate</b> <b>inversion</b> transactions. In addition, this essay reviews the relationship between such cumulative abnormal returns and certain firm level incentives to shift earnings, tax haven utilization, and other firm characteristics such as permanently reinvested foreign earnings. Results reveal that the level of both permanently reinvested earnings and intangible assets impact the value shareholders place on the shares of firms engaged in corporate inversions.

40|$|This Article {{develops}} {{a framework for}} the study of the unique effects of <b>corporate</b> <b>inversions</b> (meaning, a change in corporate residence for tax purposes) in the jurisdictions from which corporations invert (“home jurisdictions”). Currently, empirical literature on <b>corporate</b> <b>inversions</b> overstates its policy implications. It is frequently argued that in response to an uncompetitive tax environment, corporations may relocate their headquarters for tax purposes, which, in turn, may result in the loss of positive economic attributes in the home jurisdiction (such as capital expenditures, research and development activity, and high-quality jobs). The association of tax-residence relocation with the dislocation of meaningful economic attributes, however, is not empirically supported and is theoretically tenuous. The Article uses case studies to fill this gap. Based on observed factors, the Article develops grounded propositions that may describe the meaningful effects of inversions in home jurisdictions. The case studies suggest that whether tax-relocation is associated with the dislocation of meaningful economic attributes is a highly contextualized question. It seems, however, that inversions are more likely to be associated with dislocation of meaningful attributes when non-tax factors support the decision to invert. This suggests that policymakers should be able to draft tax-residence rules that exert non-tax costs on corporate locational decisions in order to prevent tax-motivated inversions...|$|R

Furthermore, acquirers in inversion-related M&A transactions generate a price premium that is in excess of what is typically generated by acquirers in non-inversion M&A. In the long-run, firms that invert through naked and M&A inversions do not generate significant excess returns above the S&P 500.

We find no discernible link between tax rates and stock returns for the UK, no matter how tax payment is measured. This is true throughout the sample period and for both customer-facing and non-customer-facing companies. However, allowing for industry norms and a host of firm characteristics, companies with lower effective tax rates have significantly higher levels of stock market risk. Firms that are reported in the newspapers in a negative way in relation to their level of corporation tax payment experience small negative stock returns, which are partially reversed within a month. However, the initial negative effects and subsequent rebound are both more pronounced for smaller companies.

40|$|A wave of <b>corporate</b> <b>inversions</b> by U. S. firms {{over the}} past two decades has {{generated}} substantial debate in academic, business, and policy circles. The core of the debate hinges on a couple of key economic questions: Do U. S. tax laws disadvantage U. S. -domiciled companies relative to their foreign competitors? And, if so, do inversions improve the competitiveness of U. S. multinational firms both abroad and at home? This brief, summarizes both old and new research that views these questions through the lens of corporations’ global effective tax rates (ETRs), and finds that the stronger case seems to be that U. S. -domiciled corporations are often tax-disadvantaged and that they can improve their competitive position by inverting. Additional evidence also suggests that U. S.

40|$|The recent wave of <b>corporate</b> tax <b>inversions</b> has {{triggered}} {{interest in what}} motivates these tax-driven transactions now. Corporate executives have argued that inversions are explained by an “anti-competitive” U.

This paper explains why this competitiveness narrative is largely fact-free, in part by using one recent articulation of that narrative (by Emerson Electric Co. ’s former vice-chairman) as a case study. The recent surge in interest in inversion transactions is explained primarily by U. S. based multinational firms’ increasingly desperate efforts to find a use for their stockpiles of offshore cash (now totaling around $ 1 trillion), and by a desire to “strip” income from the U. S. domestic tax base through intragroup interest payments to a new parent company located in a lower-taxed foreign jurisdiction.
