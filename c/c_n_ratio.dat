These materials were of varying quality, with <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> ranging from 15 : 1 to 520 : 1, and cellulose content from 0 to 34 %. Amendments were added at a fixed rate of 3. 5 mg C g− 1 of dry soil, equivalent to around 10 t ha− 1 C (to 20 cm depth). The soils were then incubated at 15 °C, and net mineral N derived from the leaves was measured at regular intervals over 168 days. Net mineralization of residue N was greatest with molasses (<b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> of 18 : 1), whereas paper waste (<b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> of 520 : 1) reduced N mineralized by up to 90 % compared with a soil-only control. As the concentration of cellulose and lignin in the amendment materials increased, so the amounts of N mineralized decreased, with 62 and 54 % of variance in N mineralized explained by cellulose and lignin content, respectively. Reduced levels of mineral N were associated with higher levels of biomass-N. The levels of N 2 O-N lost from sugar beet residues on day 14 were significantly reduced from 66 to 5 g ha− 1 where compactor (cardboard) waste had been mixed into sandy loam, but this effect was not observed in the silt loam.

40|$|Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) {{and white}} clover (Trifolium repens L.) have {{contrasting}} responses to soil mineral N availability and clover {{has the ability}} to fix atmospheric N 2 symbiotically. It has been hypothesized that these differences are the key to understanding grass?clover coexistence and vegetative dynamics in pastures. However, the whole plant response of clover and ryegrass to mineral N availability has not been fully characterized and inter-cultivar variability in the N-handling dynamics of clover has not been assessed. A detailed experimental study to address these issues was undertaken. For all clover cultivars and ryegrass, mass specific mineral N uptake rates (of whole plants) were similar saturating functions of mineral N availability. For all clover cultivars total N assimilation rates, whole plant <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> and root : shoot ratios were independent of mineral N availability. Clover growth rates were also independent of mineral N availability except for a slight (< 10 %) reduction at very low N availability levels. Specific N 2 fixation rate (whole plant) was precisely controlled to ensure fixation balanced the deficit between mineral N uptake and the total N assimilation required to maintain constant whole plant <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratio.</b> There was always a deficit between N uptake and the total N assimilation required to maintain <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratio.</b> Consequently, some <b>N</b> 2 fixation remained engaged even at high mineral N availability levels. All inter-cultivar variation in N 2 fixation dynamics could be attributed to variations in growth rate. Clover mass specific growth rate declined as plant size increased. Ryegrass specific growth rate, whole plant <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> and root : shoot ratio were dependent on N availability. Increased N availability led to increased growth rate and decreased <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> and root : shoot ratios. Specific growth rate was also dependent on plant size, growth rate declining as plant size increased. It is concluded that clover inter-cultivar variation in field performance is unlikely to be a consequence of variation in N-handling characteristics.

Suspended particulate organic matter (POM) in the seawater and suspended POM and sediment in the Tokachi River were also examined. δ 13 <b>C,</b> δ 15 <b>N</b> and <b>C</b> / <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> of the samples in the Tokachi River suggest that the spring snowmelt is an important process for the transport of terrestrial organic matter to the coastal waters. δ 13 C values of suspended POM in the surface seawater were higher in May and November than in August, while δ 15 N values of the POM were higher in May and August than in November. These changes are attributed to seasonal changes in phytoplankton growth rate and nitrate availability. δ 13 C and δ 15 N values in the sediments off Tokachi were lowest near the Tokachi River mouth, and increased offshore to constant values that persisted from 134 to 1995 m water depth. The spatial variation in <b>C</b> / <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> in the sediment mirrored those of δ 13 C and δ 15 N. Comparison of δ 13 <b>C,</b> δ 15 <b>N</b> and <b>C</b> / <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> in the sediments off Tokachi {{with those in the}} Tokachi River and seawater indicates that about half of the organic matter in the sediment was of terrestrial origin near the Tokachi River mouth, and the sedimentary organic matter from 134 to 1995 m water depth was of marine origin. The organic C content in the sediment was high near the Tokachi River mouth, and also around 1000 m water depth. The C content was significantly correlated with silt plus clay content, with different regression lines for those stations shallower and deeper than 134 m, owing to several stations of higher C content with the elevated <b>C</b> / <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> on the inner shelf.

This study followed the transfer of 15 N between plant materials, microorganisms, humified compartments and inorganic forms in 6 very different ecosystems along an altitudinal transect. The microbial conversion of the 15 N forms appeared to be strongly linked to that found previously for 14 C forms since the parameters and relationships defined for C were appropriate for modeling the N cycle. The only difference was in the flows between microbial and inorganic forms. The CO 2 -C loss was modeled using the equation for microbial respiration. Inorganic N appears also closely associated with microorganisms, which, depending on their <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> {{and those of the}} available substrates, regulate the N mineralization and immobilization processes.

To date, systematic studies to address the impact of bio-based residue amendment on the GHG balance, including the soil microorganisms, and nutrient transformation in agricultural soils are scarce.

The shift in the bacterial community composition and abundance was monitored using IonTorrent TM sequencing and qPCR, respectively, by targeting the 16 S rRNA gene. The decomposability of the residues, independent of <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratio,</b> was proportional to the GWP derived from the GHG emitted. The soils harbored distinct bacterial communities, but responded similarly to the residue amendments, because both soils exhibited the highest mean GWP after addition of the same residues (sewage sludge, aquatic plant material, and compressed beet leaves).

The concurrent {{impact on the}} forest greenhouse gas (GHG) balance is at present difficult to predict {{due to a lack}} of knowledge on controlling factors of GHG fluxes and response to changes in these factors. To improve the mechanistic understanding of the ongoing changes, we studied the response of soil-atmosphere exchange of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and methane (CH 4) at twelve experimental or natural gradient forest sites, representing anticipated future forest change. The experimental manipulations, one or more per site, included N addition (4 sites), changes of climate (temperature, 1 site; precipitation, 2 sites), soil hydrology (3 sites), harvest intensity (1 site), wood ash fertilisation (1 site), pH gradient in organic soil (1 site) and afforestation of cropland (1 site). On average, N 2 O emissions increased by 0. 06 ± 0. 03 (range 0 - 0. 3) g N 2 O-N m - 2 yr - 1 across all treatments on mineral soils, but the increase was up to 10 times higher in an acidic organic soil. Soil moisture together with mineral soil <b>C</b> / <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> and pH were found to significantly influence N 2 O emissions across all treatments. Emissions were increased by elevated N deposition, especially in interaction with increased soil moisture. High pH reduced the formation of N 2 O, even under otherwise favourable soil conditions. Oxidation (uptake) of CH 4 was on average reduced from 0. 16 plusmn; 0. 02 to 0. 04 plusmn; 0. 05 g CH 4 -C m - 2 yr - 1 by the investigated treatments. The CH 4 exchange was significantly influenced by soil moisture and soil <b>C</b> / <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> across all treatments, and CH 4 emissions occurred only in wet or water-saturated conditions. For most of the investigated forest manipulations or natural gradients, the response of both N 2 O and CH 4 fluxes was towards reducing the overall GHG forest sink. The most resilient forests were dry Mediterranean forests, as well as forests with high soil <b>C</b> / <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> or high soil pH. Mitigation strategies may focus on (i) sustainable management of wet forest areas and forested peatlands, (ii) continuous forest cover management, (iii) reducing atmospheric N input and, thus, N availability, and (iv) improving neutralisation capacity of acid soils (e. g. wood ash application). © Author(s) 2012...|$|R

The results showed that soil samples from sites under lowland rice double cropping system had greater organic <b>C</b> and total <b>N</b> content than those from soils under rice in rotation with upland crop or under other arable systems. The SOC : <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> was wider in soil samples from sites under lowland rice compared to those under other arable systems, which had lower <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratios.</b> Samples from soils under lowland rice system tended to have a narrower SIC : <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> than those under arable systems, indicating a better pedoenvironment under paddy rice. Our results support earlier findings that sites under continuous wetland rice cropping accumulate organic matter and contain higher soil organic matter compared to the sites under other arable systems...|$|R

40|$|Composting {{has become}} a widely used method of {{recycling}} yardwastes such as leaves and grass. However, very little information {{is available on the}} chemical changes that occur during the composting of different mixtures of leaves and grass. In this study, three different mixes of leaves and grass were composted at approximately 60 % moisture in a temperature controlled laboratory scale system. The mixes, which consisted of all leaves (Mix 1); 2 / 3 leaves + 1 / 3 grass (Mix 2); and 1 / 3 leaves + 2 / 3 grass (Mix 3), had initial <b>C.</b> <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> of 48, 30 and 22, respectively. The compost process was monitored by measuring the rate of CO 2 evolution, pH, stability, the degree of humification and changes in polysaccharide, carbon, nitrogen and organic matter content. Results showed that the greater the grass content of the mix, the higher the initial pH and the faster the rate of CO 2 evolution, organic matter loss and nitrogen loss. After 43 days of composting, Mixes 1, 2 and 3, lost, respectively 61 %, 74 % and 78 % of the cellulose, 57 %, 79 % and 82 % of the hemicellulose and 40 %, 49 % and 42 % of the acid-insoluble organic matter. Humification indices and stability tests indicated that composts produced from the three mixes were well humified and stable...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{measurements}} between 0 and 200 m depth {{were performed}} every 2 h over two separate periods of four {{days at a}} station in the open northwestern Mediterranean Sea (Dyfamed Station) during the Dynaproc cruise in May 1995. Estimates of the daily variations in profiles of temperature, partial pressure of CO 2, oxygen, chlorophyll a and nutrients were obtained. The distributions of the various {{physical and chemical properties}} were clearly different during the two time series, which were separated by a period of 11 days during which a wind event occurred. The mean daily utilization or production due to biological processes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), nitrate+nitrite and oxygen were calculated along isopycnals using a vertical diffusion model. Between the surface and about 20 m depth, DIC was consumed and O 2 released during the two time series while the nitrate+nitrite concentrations as well as supplies were zero. After the wind event, the O 2 : <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> of consumption (or production) were, on average, near the Redfield ratios, but during the first time series, the <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> utilization <b>ratio</b> between 20 and 35 m was two to three times that of Redfield stoichiometry and the oxygen release was low. The integrated net community production (NCP) in terms of carbon was equivalent during the two time series, whereas the chlorophyll a biomass was twice as high, on average, during the first time series but did decrease. These results imply that the production systems were different during the two periods. The first time series corresponds to a period at the end of production, due to the nutrient depletion in the euphotic layer. The formation of degradation products of the living material in dissolved organic form is probably important as indicated by the high <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> utilization <b>ratios.</b> The second time series corresponds to a reactivation of the primary production due to the upward shift of nutrients after the wind event...|$|R
40|$|Redfield {{stoichiometry}} {{has proved}} a robust paradigm for {{the understanding of}} biological production and export in the ocean on a long-term and a large-scale basis. However, deviations of carbon and nitrogen uptake ratios from the Redfield ratio have been reported. A comprehensive data set including all carbon and nitrogen pools relevant to biological production in the surface ocean (DIC, DIN, DOC, DON, POC, PON) was used to calculate seasonal new production based on carbon and nitrogen uptake in summer along 20 °W in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. The 20 °W transect between 30 and 60 °N covers different trophic states and seasonal stages of the productive surface layer, including early bloom, bloom, post-bloom and non-bloom situations. The spatial pattern has elements of a seasonal progression. We also calculated exported production, i. e., that part of seasonal new production not accumulated in particulate and dissolved pools, again separately for carbon and nitrogen. The pairs of estimates of 'seasonal new production' and 'exported production' allowed us to calculate the <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> of these quantities. While suspended particulate matter in the mixed layer largely conforms to Redfield stoichiometry, marked deviations were observed in carbon and nitrogen uptake and export with progressing season or nutrient depletion. The spring system was characterized by nitrogen overconsumption and the oligotrophic summer system by a marked carbon overconsumption. The <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratios</b> of seasonal new as well as exported production increase from early bloom values of 5 - 6 to values of 10 - 16 in the post-bloom/oligotrophic system. The summertime accumulation of nitrogen-poor dissolved organic matter can explain only part of this shift...|$|R

We used meta-analysis and an enzyme-driven biogeochemical model to explore the drivers and biogeochemical consequences {{of changes in the}} fungal-to-bacterial ratio (F : B). In our meta-analysis data set, F : B increased with soil <b>C</b> : <b>N</b> <b>ratio</b> (R 2 = 0. 224, P 3 ̆c 0. 001), a relationship predicted by our model. We found that differences in biomass turnover rates influenced F : B under conditions of C limitation, while differences in biomass stoichiometry set the upper bounds on F : B once a nutrient limitation threshold was reached. Ecological interactions between the two groups shifted along a gradient of resource stoichiometry. At intermediate substrate <b>C</b> : <b>N,</b> fungal N mineralisation fuelled bacterial growth, increasing total microbial biomass and decreasing net N mineralisation. Therefore, we conclude that differences in bacterial and fungal physiology may have large consequences for ecosystem-scale <b>C</b> and <b>N</b> cycling...|$|R
