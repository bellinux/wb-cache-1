50|$|As stated above, the {{selection}} of the input securities is important, given that there is a general lack of data points in a yield curve (there are only a fixed number of products in the market). More importantly, because the input securities have varying <b>coupon</b> <b>frequencies,</b> {{the selection}} of the input securities is critical. It makes sense to construct a curve of zero-coupon instruments from which one can price any yield, whether forward or spot, without the need of more external information.http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/wp00-17.pdf Note that certain assumptions (e.g. linear interpolation) will always be required.|$|R
50|$|Explicit modeling: {{this feature}} means that, rather than {{assuming}} a volatility a priori and computing prices from it, {{one can use}} the model to solve for volatility, which gives the implied volatility of an option at given prices, durations and exercise prices. Solving for volatility over a given set of durations and strike prices, one can construct an implied volatility surface. In this application of the Black-Scholes model, a coordinate transformation from the price domain to the volatility domain is obtained. Rather than quoting option prices in terms of dollars per unit (which are hard to compare across strikes, durations and <b>coupon</b> <b>frequencies),</b> option prices can thus be quoted in terms of implied volatility, which leads to trading of volatility in option markets.|$|R
50|$|In practice, {{interest}} rates are not constant they vary by tenor (<b>coupon</b> <b>frequency),</b> giving an interest rate curve which may be interpolated to pick an appropriate rate {{to use in the}} Black-Scholes formula. Another consideration is that {{interest rates}} vary over time. This volatility may make a significant contribution to the price, especially of long-dated options.This is simply like the interest rate and bond price relationship which is inversely related.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made to}} obtain the material characterization and fatigue crack propagation data necessary to establish the salient characteristics of a Ti- 6 Al- 2. 5 Sn(ELI) alloy fuel pump impeller {{to be used in}} a cryogenic service environment. Testing variables considered were: <b>coupon</b> orientation, <b>frequency,</b> load range ratio, and temperature. Data analysis correlated crack propagation data from conventional laboratory coupons with data from a parallel sided rotating disk used to model rotor stresses. Four major design recommendations when bore regions of fuel pump impellers to be operated in cryogenic environments are to be relatively highly stressed are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the dynamics of}} the commonly used indices for Adjustable Rate Mortgages, and systematically compares the effects of their time series properties on the interest rate sensitivity of adjustable rate mortgages. Our ARM valuation methodology allows us simultaneously to capture the effects of index dynamics, discrete coupon adjustment, mortgage prepayment, and both lifetime and periodic caps and floors. We can, moreover, either calculate an optimal prepayment strategy for mortgage holders, or use an empirical prepayment function. We find that the different dynamics of the major ARM indices lead to significant variation in the interest rate sensitivities of loans based on different indices. We also find that changing assumptions about contract features, such as loan caps and <b>coupon</b> reset <b>frequency,</b> has a significant, and in some cases unexpected, impact on our results...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{composite}} part, i. e. degree of cure, solidification, and void content, has {{direct effect on}} the resonant frequencies of the part. Therefore, this characteristic {{can be used for}} the purpose of quality control and acceptance of the sample. In order to see the effect of autoclave process on the stiffness properties of samples made by fiber placement technique, tensile and compression coupons were made out of advanced thermoplastic material (AS 4 /PEEK) using hand lay-up and autoclave process and stiffness properties obtained. Two conical sections were made by fiber placement technique and tested by impulse excitation of vibration to get natural frequencies. Finite element analysis was performed using material properties obtained from testing <b>coupons.</b> Natural <b>frequencies</b> were extracted. Comparison between the natural frequencies obtained using finite element method and experimental modal analysis was performed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the recent}} focus on Eurozone debt {{crisis and the}} credit rating {{downgrade}} not only of US debt, but that of other countries and many UK major banking institutions, this paper aims to explain the concept of bond yield, its different measures and bond pricing equation. Yields on capital market instruments are rarely quoted on the same basis, which makes direct comparison between different as investment choices impossible. Some debt instruments are quoted on discount basis, whilst coupon-bearing ones accrue interest differently, offer different compounding opportunities, have different <b>coupon</b> payment <b>frequencies,</b> and manage non-business day maturity dates differently. Moreover, rules governing debt vary across countries, markets and currencies, making yield calculation and comparison a rather complex issue. Thus, some fundamental concepts applicable to debt instrument yield measurement, with focus on bond equation, are presented here. In addition, bond equation expressed in annuity form and used to apply Newton-Raphson algorithm to derive true bond yield is also shown...|$|R
40|$|Damage {{accumulation}} during {{low cycle}} tension-tension fatigue loading has been monitored through acoustic emission for filament-wound graphite/epoxy [&plusmn; 24 / 90 / 0 / &plusmn; 45 / 0 / 90 /&plusmn; 24]T laminate <b>coupons.</b> Test <b>frequency</b> was 0. 1 and 1. 0 Hz at different dynamic load levels and specimens were cycled up to 5, 000 and 15, 000 cycles at a fatigue load ratio of 0. 1. Unnotched and double edge notched specimens (300 &times; 25 mm in dimensions) were tested, with notch length-to-width ratios of 0. 15 and 0. 25. The major objectives {{of this program}} were to determine whether monitoring acoustic emission during fatigue loading can aid in determining fatigue damage initia-tion and progression in composites and consequently be relied upon as an early warn-ing device. Emphasis {{has been placed on}} the effect of fatigue load level and test fre-quency on acoustic emission results, identifying the location at which fatigue damage initiates and progresses, and the typical failure modes occurring during fatigue loading as detected through amplitude distribution histograms. Post fatigue quasi-static tests were also conducted to evaluate the effect of fatigue loading on certain acoustic emis-sion results, e. g. post fatigue emission initiation load. Results indicate that during the initial fatigue loading most of the emission seems to be generated by damage progression. With an increasing number of cycles, however, most of the emission is primarily due to friction among fracture surfaces which have been created during the fatigue loading, e. g. matrix cracking and delamination. At-tempts were made to qualitatively distinguish between emission generated by frictio...|$|R
