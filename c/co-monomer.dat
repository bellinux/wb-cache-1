50|$|One of the {{simplest}} and most thoroughly studied polymers arises from the polymerization of ethylene. Linear low-density polyethylene, LLDPE, is of industrial importance and is currently produced on the macro- scale; millions of tons per year. Branching of polyethylene involves the oligomerization of ethylene into alpha-olefins, carried out by one catalyst, followed by ethylene polymerization using the α-olefins as <b>co-monomer,</b> carried out by a second catalyst. This system was studied by Beach and Kissin which {{was found to have}} suffered in some inadequacies.

50|$|In {{recent years}} many {{industrial}} efforts {{have focused on}} tuning the color of lights using polyfluorenes. It was found that by doping green or red emitting materials into polyfluorenes one could tune the color emitted by the polymers. Since polyfluorene homopolymers emit higher energy blue light, they can transfer energy via Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to lower energy emitters. In addition to doping, color of polyfluorenes can be tuned by copolymerizing the fluorene monomers with other low band gap monomers. Researchers at the Dow Chemical Company synthesized several fluorene-based copolymers by alternating copolymerization using 5,5-dibromo-2,2-bithiophene which showed yellow emission and 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole, which showed green emission. Other copolymerizations are also suitable; researchers at IBM performed random copolymerization of fluorene with 3,9(10)-dibromoperylene,4,4-dibromo-R-cyanostilbene, and 1,4-bis(2-(4-bromophenyl)-1-cyanovinyl)-2-(2-ethylhexyl)-5-methoxybenzene. Only {{a small amount of}} the <b>co-monomer,</b> approximately 5%, was needed to tune the emission of the polyfluorene from blue to yellow. This example further illustrates that by introducing monomers that have a lower band gap than the fluorene monomer, one can tune the color that is emitted by the polymer.|$|E
