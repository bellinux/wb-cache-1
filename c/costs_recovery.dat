40|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>recovery</b> from {{irrigation}} {{in almost}} all the countries presents a dismal picture. Low <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> coupled with declining government finances {{has led to the}} deterioration of both the quality of the built infrastructure and institutions managing and governing such infrastructure.

40|$|Security {{of energy}} supply {{is a key}} to social and {{economic}} development of society. Liberalization of power market has brought changes in the process of decision making regarding new investments in power system and certain concerns arise related to adequacy of the present investments. Taking into consideration that significant amount of generating capacities in Croatian power system will be shut down in the following years, it will be even more challenging to satisfy a growing demand. Energy saved through energy efficiency measures can be considered an alternative source of energy. Within this thesis a question has been answered whether it is more economically feasible to invest public money in new generating capacities or to invest it in large-scale energy efficiency improvements. The answer has been provided through calculating levelized cost of electricity of three different electricity generating options and comparing it to energy saving costs of currently proposed energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, the problem of peaking capacity and fixed <b>costs</b> <b>recovery</b> has been analyzed. It has been concluded that a certain capacity mechanism is needed in order to ensure investment <b>costs</b> <b>recovery</b> and stimulate investments. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this {{research}} the author reflected upon the economic environmental instrument of <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> for water services as provided {{for in the}} WFD. These reflections were made {{in order to address}} the question ‘What is the aim of the <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> provision in the WFD and what obscurities arise in its interpretation that may hinder its effectiveness to attainment of these aims?’ In order to address the main question an examination was made whether the current <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> provision in Article 9 WFD has been positioned (and interpreted) in a manner that allows its application to reach full effect. That means whether it is positioned in such manner to contribute to the (environmental) objectives of sustainable, balanced and equitable water use of the WFD. In this respect a teleological approach in the examination was used in order to reflect upon the potential effectiveness of the <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> provision in relation to the normative goals to be reached. In this approach, first the normative context of the <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> provision was examined. This examination has been based on, firstly, a review of the position the <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> provision, as economic instrument, has been given in the WFD, related to the normative environmental goals. Secondly, the legislative history of the <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> provision was examined to determine what constitutes the <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> provision. In this respect also a legal theoretical approach has been used to determine what kind of character the <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> provision entails, the main character of a principle or rule. This approach was taken because the preliminary determination or assessment of a provision having the character of a principle or rule is frequently ignored, but in my view relevant, as the legal scope of provisions with the character of a principle or rule differ and will or should influence the performance of the provision within its normative context. The examination of the most important elements of the <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> provision furthermore has shown that many obscurities exist and vague, not sufficiently defined terminology is used. In this book arguments are provided to address <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> in a different manner than the European Court of Justice seems to have done. A manner that may enhance the effectiveness of the instrument of <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> to contribute to reaching sustainable and equitable water use. The findings in this book provide further insight on how to position <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> in European (and Dutch) legislation in order to enhance its potential effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|For {{several years}} tax dollars have {{gradually}} diminished, causing {{parks and recreation}} managers to become more entrepreneurial in developing financial strategies for delivering high quality and cost efficient recreational services to the citizens. One financial tool, under much discussion, is for parks and recreation managers to establish formal <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> plans for their departments. This paper {{presents the results of}} a study in which local Nevada governmental parks and recreation departments were surveyed and evaluated to determine if they are using formal <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> plans and if cost efficiencies have been improved. The research focused on identifying factors associated with the development of formal <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> plans and the financial impact of formal <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> plans. The survey results indicate that Nevada’s parks and recreation departments continue to be reliant on the general fund. On average, departments derive 70 % of their operational dollars from the general fund and collect approximately 25 % from fees and charges. The data collected show that all organizations responding have some type of <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> practice, mostly from fees and charges, but less than 35 % have a formal <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> plan. This number will increase to approximately 50 % when current plans in the developmental process are completed and implemented. Urban cities with large budgets and serving large populations report having formal <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> plans. None of the county agencies reports having a formal <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> plan established for their parks and recreation departments. Caution must be taken when drawing conclusions regarding county parks and recreation departments as only 50 % of the counties returned a survey.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a stochastic coordination of generation and transmission expansion planning model in a com-petitive electricity market. The Monte Carlo simulation method {{is applied to}} consider random outages of generating units and transmission lines as well as inaccuracies in the long-term load forecasting. The scenario reduction technique is introduced for reducing the computational burden {{of a large number}} of planning scenarios. The proposed model assumes a capacity payment mech-anism and a joint energy and transmission market for investors’ <b>costs</b> <b>recovery.</b> The proposed approach simulates the decision making behavior of individual market participants and the ISO. It is an iterative process for simulating the interactions among GENCOs, TRANSCOs and ISO. The iterative process might be terminated by the ISO based on a pre-specified stopping criterion. The case studies illustrate the applications of proposed stochastic method in a coordinated generation and transmission planning problem when considering uncertainties.

The Egyptian Water Regulatory Agency {{estimates the}} degree of overall <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> in 2012/13 at 62%, and the recovery of {{operation and maintenance costs}} excluding depreciation at 76%. The regulator classifies this as insufficient compared to a good performance of more than 80% full <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> and more than 100% operation and maintenance <b>cost</b> <b>recovery.</b> This is lower than {{the degree of}} <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> achieved in 2010, when the recovery of operation and maintenance costs, excluding depreciation, through operating revenues was 95% for water supply and sanitation, ranging from 31% in Sinai to 134% in Beheira. Nevertheless, the degree of <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> is apparently higher {{than it was in the}} early 2000s. According to one estimate dating from prior to 2007, <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> was only 20%, with tariffs at 0.23 EP per m3 and costs at 1.10 EP per m3. According to another estimate, between 1982 and 2004 the government spent 65 billion Egyptian pounds (about 10.73 billion USD at the exchange rate of 2004) for water supply and sanitation, of which 40% was recovered through tariff revenues.|$|R
30|$|Contribution to the {{variance}} of NPV under the production share contract is shown in Fig.  8 b. According to Fig.  8 b, we conclude that the oil price randomness has the greatest impact, OOIP ranks second; the <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> rate also has a great impact, while Opex per barrel has a small impact. Under the assumed production share contract in this paper, sales income is assessed when the produced oil is sold, then the royalty is paid. After that, the limit of cost oil is decided by the net income (i.e., sales income minus royalty) and <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> rate, and then the actual recovered cost is determined by available and forwarded production costs. Therefore, the <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> rate has a great influence on NPV, but the influence depends on the <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> mechanism. Overall, {{the influence of the}} <b>cost</b> <b>recovery</b> rate is not direct, consequently, its impact is relatively low. The impacts of oil price, OOIP, Opex per barrel are analyzed later.|$|R
40|$|The Spanish Electric Power Act {{intends to}} {{establish}} an electricity market carried out in a coordinated way according {{to the principles of}} free competition. Its resulting market price is aimed at being passed-through to consumers, but unfortunately it has not yet played the central role characteristic of a well-functioning power market. There is a main reason behind the verified lack of trust the regulator (the administration) shows in the market: the horizontal concentration that characterizes the wholesale market. This distrust happens to be the reason behind some other negative regulatory design flaws, for instance, a mechanism of stranded <b>costs</b> <b>recovery</b> that has severely interfered with the market functioning {{and the fact that the}} tariff design does not fully pass-through this market price to consumers. The main purpose of the “White Paper for the reform of the regulatory scheme of the power generation in Spain”, Pérez-Arriaga (2005), is to settle the regulatory conditions to revert this situation.

40|$|Increased {{adoption}} of distributed PV, {{and other forms}} of distributed generation, have the potential to affect utility-customer interactions, system <b>costs</b> <b>recovery,</b> and utility revenue streams. If a greater number of electricity customers choose to self-generate, demand for system power will decrease and utility fixed costs will have to be recovered over fewer kilowatt hours of sales. As such, regulators will need to determine the value and cost of additional distributed PV and determine the appropriate allocation of the costs and benefits among consumers. The potential for new business models to emerge also has implications for regulation and rate structures that ensure equitable solutions for all electricity grid users. This report examines regulatory tools and rate designs for addressing emerging issues with the expanded {{adoption of}} distributed PV and evaluates the potential effectiveness and viability of these options going forward. It offers the groundwork needed in order for regulators to explore mechanisms and ensure that utilities can collect sufficient revenues to provide reliable electric service, cover fixed costs, and balance cost equity among ratepayers [...] while creating a value proposition for customers to adopt distributed PV...|$|E
40|$|In {{the art of}} photography, the {{phenomenon}} of vignetting means blurring of an image at its periphery compared to its centre. Vignettes are a form of road pricing independent of travel distance. Their usage in Croatia was recently rejected while in Europe, the number of countries using them, is increasing. The economic question of using vignettes as a primary source of revenue for the financing of Croatian highways was blurred by economically peripheral but politically sensitive welfare transfer issues. There has been no visible attempt to push the discussion back into the field of economics by using purely economic criteria such as: opportunity cost of usage, “sunk costs”, marginal costs, and total <b>costs</b> <b>recovery.</b> The paper aims at un-vignetting (un-blurring) the issue and re-focusing it towards economic arguments. The approach taken is a deductive-nomological argument based on opportunity costs of usage. The conclusion is straightforward: the vignettes are Pareto efficient since they make the society {{in general and the}} consumers in particular ultimately better off even after taking into account compensations. The opportunity costs of usage of congestion-free roads are zero. The optimal quantity-dependent price is then also zero. Since zero price does not recover costs, a differential pricing scheme needs to be put in place: one that does not depend on distance travelled...|$|E
