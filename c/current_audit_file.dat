40|$|This study uses <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> data {{to analyze}} the {{relationship}} between the auditors’ preliminary assessments of going-concern and fraud risk and the planning and performance of the audit. We analyze {{the relationship between the}}se risks and the auditor’s assessment of inherent and control risk within the revenue cycle. We also examine whether these risk assessments {{have an effect on the}} persuasiveness, timing and extent of audit evidence gathered beyond the components of the audit risk model (ARM). Our results indicate that both fraud risk and going-concern risk are significantly related to both inherent risk and control risk. In addition our results indicate that while fraud risk is substantially captured by the <b>current</b> <b>audit</b> risk model, going-concern risk remains significantly related to our proxies for the persuasiveness and timing of audit evidence after controlling for inherent and control risk...|$|R

The quality of audit services is under the international harmonization {{as well as the}} financial reporting to achieve the results of audit procedures to be internatinally comparable. The thesis is very closely focused on the form and performace of quality control of Czech audit entities done by the independent authority The Chamber of Auditors of the Czech Republic, respectively by the control entiy named Supervisory Committee. The aim of the thesis is to verify the hypothesis related to year-on-year increase in audit procedures and the <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> quality with the assumption that the increase of quality is enhanced by the quality control from the side of internal or external quality controller. The hypothesis {{is at the end of}} the thesis verified as a reset of the practical part of the thesis in which is analyzed and assessed quality of specific <b>audit</b> <b>file.</b> The <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> was chosen intentionally for the purpose of the aim of thesis, to compare the quality of <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> before and after the internal quality control.

40|$|An {{inherent}} {{aspect of}} an audit {{is the level}} of task complexity that junior auditors (staff and senior level associates) endure on a daily basis. This complexity directly impacts an auditor’s ability to form an appropriate problem representation, which in turn impacts judgment performance. One of the key components of this process is having sufficient knowledge for purposes of problem representation; without it, the auditor’s problem representation and ultimately judgment performance are negatively impacted. Conversely, audit teams can positively influence the conciseness of problem representation and performance by way of effective task-specific knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer in the audit field occurs during three distinct phases: when an auditor reviews prior and/or current year workpapers; when an auditor requests help; and/or during the workpaper review process. For purposes of efficiency and increasing (i. e. improving) problem representation, prior to any deleterious effects, it’s critical that the audit profession understand how to maximize the knowledge transfer as soon as possible after the auditor’s initial assignment of the task. Because auditors commonly will immediately refer to audit programs in the current year documentation in the electronic <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> to gain an understanding of the task, maximizing the knowledge transfer within the electronic <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> is critical to increasing auditor judgment performance. I propose utilizing media richness theory to establish an increased media rich transfer of knowledge via the electronic <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> from the <b>audit</b> managers (expert) to junior auditors (novice). Procedure screens within the electronic <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> would likely be categorized as “written, formal” mediums within the media richness theory, because the source of information is impersonal. However, if audit firms can successfully transform the transfer of information within the <b>audit</b> <b>files</b> from being solely formal document screens to also incorporate personal source characteristics, they will successfully increase the information richness, which will allow for a more successful transfer of knowledge and subsequently the ability for the auditor to more effectively form a problem representation...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{designed and}} implemented an intelligent tutoring system for teaching computer intrusion detection to potential or current system administrators of computer networks. The Intrusion- Detection Tutoring System (IDTS) is an intelligent tutoring system built using Quintus Prolog and METUTOR general-purpose tutoring software written by Professor Rowe. The operating {{environment of the}} IDTS is a virtual one, based on UNIX; it uses some common UNIX commands and file hierarchy. After both student and tutor analyze a static <b>audit</b> <b>file</b> to find suspicious and or malicious behavior, the student tries to fix the damage, and the computer critiques the student's actions using means-ends analysis. Using its nineteen behavior rules, IDTS can classify eleven different types of intruder behavior known to exploit system vulnerabilities, and can tutor the student how to detect this behavior and how to efficiently return the system to a secure state after the intrusion has occurred. Four different <b>audit</b> <b>files</b> of varying length were tested with IDTS. IDTS correctly identified most intruder behavior in both manually and computer generated <b>audit</b> <b>files,</b> and showed it could correctly tutor on that behavior. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{examined}} how New Zealand auditors could {{be motivated to}} step up current practice and prioritise the consideration of environmental matters in the audit of financial reports. Institutional Theory is the relevant theory for framing the research. Design/methodology/approach – This research is qualitative. Twenty-seven New Zealand auditors were interviewed using semi-structured questions covering the research topic. Findings – The interview evidence indicate that a legislated mandate enforced by the New Zealand Government {{is the most powerful}} driver of change to <b>current</b> <b>audit</b> practice. All other drivers and strategies for further advancing current practice identified by the interviewees would easily follow on from the legislative mandate. Practical implications – Understanding what the potential drivers and strategies for further development in financial auditors’ current practices would (1) assist in aligning financial <b>audit</b> practices with <b>current</b> <b>audit</b> practices of public sector auditors; (2) assist the audit profession and financial auditors to benchmark improvements to <b>current</b> <b>audit.</b> If the changes are implemented, then the New Zealand auditing profession would be meeting overseas expectations for auditors’ role in environmental risk assessment and management in corporate governance. Originality/value – This research will contribute (1) generally to qualitative research in audit practice; (2) specifically to the extant literature and will also add a geographical variation to existing literature, making a timely contribution to the international literature on audit practice at both theoretical and professional practice levels...|$|R

It is argued that the nine enduring principles should be replaced by seven enduring tensions – the fault lines of auditing - so as to rethink the conceptual basis of auditing standards. Further research should be carried out to test the robustness of the seven enduring tensions as the basis for standard setting. A first step might be to map the existing standards onto the new conceptual basis. Standard setters can deploy a new architecture for auditing standards and one that addresses the tensions inherent in auditing. Standard setting should be recognised as an activity dominated by ethical choices and concerns. auditing, professional ethics, standards...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) {{have become}} an {{important}} component of infrastructure protection mechanism to secure the current and emerging networks, its services and applications by detecting, alerting and taking necessary actions against the malicious activities. The network size, technology diversities and security policies make networks more challenging and hence there is a requirement for IDS which should be very accurate, adaptive, extensible and more reliable. Although there exists the novel framework for this requirement namely Mining Audit Data for Automated Models for Intrusion Detection (MADAM ID), it is having some performance shortfalls in processing the audit data. Approach: Few experiments were conducted on tcpdump data of DARPA and BCM <b>audit</b> <b>files</b> by applying the algorithms and tools of MADAM ID in the processing of audit data, mine patterns, construct features and build RIPPER classifiers. By putting it all together, four main categories of attacks namely DOS, R 2 L, U 2 R and PROBING attacks were simulated. Results: This study outlines the experimentation results of MADAM ID in testing the DARPA and BSM data on a simulated network environment. Conclusion: The strengths and weakness of MADAM ID has been identified thru the experiments conducted on tcpdump data and also on Pascal based <b>audit</b> <b>files</b> of Basic Security Module (BSM).

However, such assumption may not always be held, due to the possibly weak sense of security and/or low security settings at the client.

In this paper, we focus on this new aspect of cloud storage auditing. We investigate how to reduce the damage of the client's key exposure in cloud storage auditing, and give the first practical solution for this new problem setting. We formalize the definition and the security model of auditing protocol with key-exposure resilience and propose such a protocol. In our design, we employ the binary tree structure and the preorder traversal technique to update the secret keys for the client. We also develop a novel authenticator construction to support the forward security and the property of blockless verifiability. The security proof and the performance analysis show that our proposed protocol is secure and efficient. 13 page(s...|$|R
