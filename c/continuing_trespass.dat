25|$|Trespass to land is {{any direct}} {{interference}} with {{land in the}} possession of another and is actionable per se. Examples of trespass are unauthorised entry to land, placing things on land and inducing animals to enter. Also, <b>continuing</b> <b>trespass,</b> which is actionable from day to day, occurs when there is continuation of presence after permission is withdrawn. The position taken with regards to the elements of trespass is similar in the UK and India.|$|E
40|$|In Walkington v The Queen, the English Court of Criminal Appeal enunciated {{criteria}} fordetermining {{whether a}} building contains parts thereof {{for purposes of}} ss 76 and 77 of the CrimesAct 1958 (Vic) : burglary and aggravated burglary respectively. In Singh v The Queen, the VictorianCourt of Appeal was confronted with {{a situation in which}} a trespassory entry had been made into abuilding that, according to the principles enunciated in Walkington, did not consist of any part orparts. Recognizing that there was scant evidence with which to prove that the accused’s entry hadbeen accompanied by an intention to commit one of the crimes specified in ss 76 and 77, the courtnonetheless affirmed the applicant’s conviction for aggravated burglary under s 77. In so doing,the court reaffirmed its earlier decision in The Queen v Chimirri which held that a trespassoryentry into a building results in <b>continuing</b> <b>trespass</b> {{for as long as the}} accused remains in thebuilding. In Chimirri, it was further held that if an accused forms an intention to commit one ofthe specified crimes subsequent to the initial trespassory entry and enters a part of the buildingwith that intention, he or she has committed burglary, aggravated burglary, or both by virtueof the <b>continuing</b> <b>trespass</b> doctrine. The discussion to follow will demonstrate that the court’sreasoning in both Chimirri and Singh is not only flawed, but flies in the face of the very passagesfrom the judgment of Lane LJ in Walkington that were quoted with apparent approval in Singh. The discussion will further demonstrate that the <b>continuing</b> <b>trespass</b> doctrine adds nothing of valueto the law of burglary as it existed prior to Chimirri and Singh; rather, its only effect is to addconfusion and uncertainty to what had been a settled area of the law...|$|E
40|$|The {{history of}} water law {{throughout}} the United States is dynamic. Beginning with the inherited doctrine of English common law natural flow riparianism, {{the changes in}} law {{can be described as}} instrumentalist in the sense that 2 ̆ 2 judges and legislatures made this branch of water law an instrument of pro-developmental policy. 2 ̆ 2 When the natural flow doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s requirement that the stream flow down to lower owners undiminished as to quantity and quality clashed with the needs of the extensive utilization of water powered mills in the nineteenth century, the courts pioneered an American doctrine of reasonable use riparianism that would sustain water-dependent industrialization. Legislatures joined in as well, passing the Mill Acts, which defused the threat of injunction against mills whose ponds inundated portions of neighboring lands. Those laws effectively forbade injunctions for <b>continuing</b> <b>trespass</b> and substituted judicially determined amounts of compensation in what can only be viewed as an early instrumentally driven form of condemnation favoring a private use that allowed water to be used in a manner that contributed to growth and prosperity...|$|E
50|$|Captain Stanton's sympathies {{gradually}} {{change when}} the miners <b>continue</b> their <b>trespassing.</b> He also is attracted to Dawn Gillis, a courageous missionary teacher who is half Indian herself that teaches in an Indian school. Stanton ruins his military career by beating up a local troublemaker who makes racist taunts to Dawn, then later engages {{a group of}} whites who massacre a group of Indians at the school that leads Stanton to open fire on the whites killing several of them.|$|R
50|$|Black Kettle, {{chief of}} the Southern Cheyenne, wanted peace with the United States. He and other chiefs signed a treaty in 1861 which {{resulted}} in his tribes being assigned to a reservation along Sand Creek, although the area was nearly devoid of game. White settlers <b>continued</b> to <b>trespass</b> upon Cheyenne land. Unable to feed their families, some Cheyenne begged for food from settlers; others returned to old hunting grounds. Still others raided settlers and wagon trains for food.|$|R
5000|$|On February 16, 1990, a {{fire was}} set by an {{arsonist}} {{in a building}} {{on the south side}} of the property doing considerable damage. Part of the buildings were razed during the fire to contain the blaze. [...] The cost to the county to fight the fire was $359,000. Due to the damage and <b>continuing</b> problems with <b>trespassing</b> and vandalism, the buildings were all razed in 1990.|$|R
40|$|Application of {{the rule}} of repose to {{environmental}} contamination claims for trespass and nuisance will preclude recovery for plaintiffs who discover the harm or injury outside the repose period. The rule of repose is subject neither to the discovery rule or other equitable tolling devices and runs from the date of the defendant’s culpable conduct. As a consequence, the rule extinguishes claims regardless of accrual of the cause of action. Environmental plaintiffs suffering property damage are particularly vulnerable to the repose bar as harm can occur over many years through the migration of unseen contaminants. Operation {{of the rule}} of repose within the construct of trespass and nuisance law, which includes the doctrine of <b>continuing</b> <b>trespass</b> or nuisance, offers an opportunity for environmental plaintiffs who can demonstrate a continuing course of conduct to circumvent the repose bar without subverting the rule’s primary purpose of bringing certainty to stale claims. Key, however, is the identification of the defendant’s act which will trigger the running of the rule. This Article analyzes several different points at which the defendant may be said to have acted in both singular and continuing conduct and the impact on both the plaintiff and the repose period. The Article proposes that continuing tort theory can help to rebalance the equities between plaintiffs and defendants, and opens the door to a more rational expansion of the pool of resources dedicated to the costs associated with environmental contamination...|$|E
40|$|The {{wrongful}} use {{of another}} 2 ̆ 7 s automobile, even though {{accompanied by a}} trespassory taking, cannot, if followed by {{a return to the}} owner or an abandonment, be easily brought within the definition of larceny at common law or under the ordinary larceny statutes, because of the requirement of intent to deprive the owner permanently of his property. Smith v. State, 146 S. W. 547; State v. Boggs (Iowa, 1917), 164 N. W. 759; McClain, Criminal Law, § 566. Of course, such intent, at the time of taking, might be found in spite of return or abandonment, though it is doubtful whether the bare circumstances stated above would constitute sufficient evidence of that intent to go to the jury. Rex v. Phillips, 2 East P. C. 662; Brennon v. Com., 169 Ky. 815; State v. Slingerland, 19 Nev. 135; State v. Davis, 38 N. J. L. 176; People v. Flynn, 7 Utah 378. As a matter of law, intent to abandon at a distance, as distinguished from intent to return, has been held to be sufficient, on the principle that reckless indifference to harmful consequences is equivalent, in law as well as in ethics, to a direct purpose to produce such consequences. State v. Davis, supra. See also the other cases last above cited. Reg. v. Prince, 13 Cox C. C. 138, and People v. Cummings, 123 Cal. 269. And, if this position be granted, such abandonment after a trespassory taking would make a case of larceny, on the theory of <b>continuing</b> <b>trespass,</b> even though, at the time of taking, the intent had been to return the property...|$|E
50|$|The film {{explores the}} central role that {{elephants}} play in Thai culture - elephants have been ingrained in traditions and spirituality for thousands of years. Yet today, Asian elephants are facing extinction: they are an endangered species, with fewer than 45,000 Asian elephants left on earth. Most elephants in Thailand are forced into the $40-billion-a-year tourism trade. The film explains that illegal tusks are smuggled into the country, making Thailand {{one of the biggest}} markets for the global ivory trade. It also describes how the growing human population <b>continues</b> to <b>trespass</b> into elephant habitats. A century ago, more than 100,000 elephants roamed freely in Thailand's lush forests. Today, only 4,000 remain - 2,800 of which are captive.|$|R
50|$|Peter Smith J {{held that}} Bocardo SA’s title {{extended}} to the substrata beneath the land’s surface, and though the pipelines cause not damage, nor affected enjoyment, there was a trespass. Under the Mines (Working Facilities and Support) Act 1966 s 8(2) compensation {{would be based on}} ‘what would be fair and reasonable between a willing grantor and a willing grantee’. He awarded £621,180, calculated at 9% {{of the value of the}} oil extracted between July 2000 and December 2007, and <b>continuing</b> damages for <b>trespass</b> based on the same.|$|R
40|$|Political {{action on}} the cusp between social {{movements}} and militancy provides a robust test of universal theories of both collective action and terrorism. In particular, radical environ-mentalism and {{the new wave of}} ecoterrorism in the United States deserve social science con-sideration as one such radical cusp movement. Data on 84 ecoterrorist events in the United States, 1998 - 2005, from the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism’s Terrorism Incident Database are considered vis-à-vis previous theories to identify possible patterns. A methodology for research on clandestine organizations, the imputation of cells from incident data, is proposed. Analysis suggests that radicalism is a product of social movements and that it diffuses according to exogenous factors, in particular local political climates. Little support is found for theories of continued radicalization in militant movements, but some evidence in-dicates that a general life cycle of political violence exists. It seems a rule that broad social movements spawn radical fringes. While some radicals may return to a moderate stance, others veer into militancy and the use of political violence, such as the Black Panthers in the American Civil Rights movement or the Weather Underground of the anti-Vietnam war movement. The environmental movement also has its share of radicals, with direct action groups such as Greenpeace, the Sea Shepherd Society, and Earth First!. Since the early 1980 s, radicalism among environmentalists seemed mostly on the decline until a major fire at a Vail, Colorado ski resort in October 1998 sparked a wave of attention on the new “ecoterrorism. ” A formerly obscure group, the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) claimed the arson attack and seized national headlines with a communiqué: “This action is just a warning. We will be back if this greedy corporation <b>continues</b> to <b>trespass</b> into wild and unroaded areas...|$|R
