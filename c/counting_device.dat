25|$|Devices {{have been}} used to aid {{computation}} for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest <b>counting</b> <b>device</b> was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers. The use of counting rods is one example. The abacus was early used for arithmetic tasks. What we now call the Roman abacus was used in Babylonia as early as c. 2700–2300 BC. Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.|$|E
2500|$|Alpha {{particles}} are tiny, positively charged particles that are spontaneously emitted by certain substances such as uranium and radium. [...] Rutherford himself had discovered them in 1899. In 1908 {{he was trying}} to precisely measure their charge-to-mass ratio. To do this, he first needed to know just how many alpha particles his sample of radium was giving off (after which he would measure their total charge and divide one by the other). [...] Alpha {{particles are}} too tiny to be seen even with a microscope, but Rutherford knew that alpha particles ionize air molecules, and if the air is within an electric field, the ions will produce an electric current. On this principle, Rutherford and Geiger designed a simple <b>counting</b> <b>device</b> which consisted of two electrodes in a glass tube. [...] Every alpha particle that passed through the tube would create a pulse of electricity that could be counted. [...] It was an early version of the Geiger counter.|$|E

Also included is a guide for planning a traffic count program and data collection session. Once the data is collected, it then becomes necessary to evaluate and analyze the data so that accurate traffic volume predictions can be made. This document provides the process that should be followed in order to properly analyze the data obtained from the field.

40|$|BackgroundOur {{objectives}} were {{to evaluate the}} utility of electronic hand hygiene <b>counting</b> <b>devices</b> in outpatient settings {{and the impact of}} results feedback on physicians' hand hygiene behaviors. MethodsWe installed 130 electronic hand hygiene <b>counting</b> <b>devices</b> in our redesigned outpatient department. We remotely monitored physicians' hand hygiene practices during outpatient examinations and calculated the adherence rate as follows: number of hand hygiene counts divided by the number of outpatients examined multiplied by 100. Physician individual adherence rates were also classified into 4 categories. ResultsTwo hundred and eighty physicians from 28 clinical departments were monitored for 3 months. The overall hand hygiene adherence rate was 10. 7 % at baseline, which improved significantly after feedback to 18. 2 % in the third month. Of the clinical departments, 78. 6 % demonstrated significant improvement in hand hygiene compliance. The change in the percentage of physicians in each category before and after feedback were as follows: very low (84. 3 % to 72. 1 %), low (8. 6 % to 14. 3 %), moderate (2. 9 % to 8. 9 %), and high (4. 3 % to 4. 6 %), from the first to third month, respectively. Based on category assessment, 17. 1 % of physicians were classified as responders. ConclusionsPhysicians' adherence to hand hygiene practices during outpatient examinations was successfully monitored remotely using electronic <b>counting</b> <b>devices.</b> Audit and feedback of adherence data may {{have a positive impact on}} physicians' hand hygiene compliance...|$|R
40|$|High-quality {{continuous}} {{counts of}} pedestrian volume {{are necessary to}} evaluate the effects of pedestrian infrastructure investments and to improve pedestrian volume modeling. Automated pedestrian <b>counting</b> <b>devices</b> can meet the need for continuous counts of pedestrian volume and reduce the labor cost associated with manual pedestrian counting and data entry. However, most existing automated pedestrian devices are not well suited {{to the task of}} counting pedestrians in outdoor environments, and little is known about their effectiveness and accuracy. This study addresses the lack of performance information on automated <b>counting</b> <b>devices</b> by providing a review of commercially available devices and by testing the accuracy of a promising device in an outdoor urban context. It finds that a dual sensor passive infrared device is capable of producing reasonably accurate pedestrian volume counts in the outdoor urban context. It also finds a high degree of inter-reliability between counts collected by field observers and through video recordings. ...|$|R
