40|$|Experimental {{studies are}} {{presented}} {{to show the}} effect of thermal stresses on thermal contact conductance (TCC) at low contact pressures. It is observed that in a closed <b>contact</b> <b>assembly,</b> contact pressure acting on the interface changes with the changing temperature of contact members. This change in contact pressure consequently causes variations in the TCC of the junction. A relationship between temperature change and the corresponding magnitude of developed thermal stress in a <b>contact</b> <b>assembly</b> is determined experimentally. Inclusion of a term called temperature dependent load correction factor is suggested in the theoretical model for TCC to make it capable of predicting TCC values more accurately in contact assemblies that experience large temperature fluctuations.

It consists of two concentric TMF contacts, in which the inner contact has a disk-shaped structure (spiral contact) and the outer contact a cup-shaped structure. This <b>contact</b> <b>assembly</b> gives several advantages {{over the use of}} single-TMF contacts, as the constricted high-current arc might either split between both inner and outer contacts or commute from the inner to the outer contact and continue its rotation. In both scenarios, we expect a better distribution of the arc energy over a larger contact surface. B-field simulation and Lorentz force calculation are carried out to investigate whether two constricted arcs, with one burning on the inner contact and the other on the outer contact, can coexist given their mutual attraction. Single-phase high current interruption tests were carried out to compare the performance of this new double-TMF contact system with that of a standard spiral-type single-TMF one. These tests have revealed superior performance of the new double-TMF contact system, which could interrupt current amplitude at least 20 % higher than the one interrupted by the single-TMF contact system...|$|E
40|$|Classical cadherin {{adhesion}} molecules {{are fundamental}} determinants of cell-cell recognition that function {{in cooperation with}} the actin cytoskeleton. Productive cadherin-based cell recognition is characterized by a distinct morphological process of contact zone extension, where limited initial points of adhesion are progressively expanded into broad zones of contact. We recently demonstrated that E-cadherin ligation recruits the Arp 2 / 3 actin nucleator complex to the plasma membrane in regions where cell contacts are undergoing protrusion and extension. This suggested that Arp 2 / 3 might generate the protrusive forces necessary for cell surfaces to extend upon one another during <b>contact</b> <b>assembly.</b> We tested this hypothesis in mammalian cells by exogenously expressing the CA region of N-WASP. This fragment, which potently inhibits Arp 2 / 3 -mediated actin assembly in vitro, also effectively reduced actin assembly at cadherin adhesive contacts. Blocking Arp 2 / 3 activity by this strategy profoundly reduced the ability of cells to extend cadherin adhesive contacts but did not affect cell adhesiveness.

40|$|Kindler {{syndrome}} (KS) {{is a rare}} disorder {{leading to}} keratinocyte fragility, poikiloderma and palmar hyperkeratosis (OMIM 173650). Defects in the actin/focal contact associated protein kindlin- 1 encoded by the gene KIND 1 {{have been shown to}} underlie this disease. We assessed the function of kindlin- 1 in human keratinocytes and fibroblasts using RNAi knockdown. RNAi treatment reduced KIND 1 message by 72 % and 63 % in cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts, respectively. RNAi treatment reduced cultured keratinocyte but not fibroblast cell adhesion to plastic. Furthermore, kindlin- 1 depletion reduced keratinocyte (but not fibroblast) survival by increasing rates of adherent keratinocyte apoptosis, as detected by TUNEL staining. Kindlin- 1 depleted keratinocytes demonstrated an initial delay in cell spreading and filopodia formation (as observed by scanning EM) but were associated with some focal adhesion / <b>contact</b> <b>assembly</b> (as visualized by vinculin staining). Keratinocyte (but not fibroblast) migration was increased after kindlin- 1 depletion. Taken together our data suggest that kindlin- 1 plays important roles in keratinocyte cell-substrate adhesion, spreading, migration and in keratinocyte survival in vitro. These observations may explain the loss of keratinocyte-basement membrane adhesion in the pathogenesis of KS induced skin fragility. Furthermore, reductions in keratinocyte survival and/or increased rates of apoptotic cell death may underlie the early-onset poikiloderma observed in KS cases...|$|E

In {{order to determine the}} role of pp 60 (c-src) and related kinases in these processes, we have compared the dynamic reorganization of phosphotyrosine, vinculin, focal adhesion kinase and tensin in cells with altered expression of Src-family kinases. Both null cells for pp 60 (c-src) and triple knockout cells for pp 60 (c-src), pp 59 (fyn), and pp 62 (c-yes) exhibited decreased phosphotyrosine levels in focal contacts when compared with wild-type cells. pp 60 (c-src) -null cells also exhibited faster assembly of cell-matrix adhesions and a more exuberant recruitment of FAK to these sites. Tensin, which normally segregates into fibrillar adhesions was localized in large focal contacts in the two mutant cell lines, suggesting involvement of pp 60 (c-src) in the segregation of focal contacts and fibrillar adhesions. Moreover, treatment of wild-type cells with tyrphostin AG 1007, which inhibits both pp 60 (c-src) and FAK activity, induced accumulation of tensin in peripheral focal adhesions. These findings demonstrate that Src family kinases, and pp 60 (c-src) in particular, have a central role in regulating protein dynamics at cell-matrix interfaces, both during early stages of interaction and in mature focal contacts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – This work {{describes}} an experimental study using {{design of experiments}} applied in magnetic actuators. The main objective is the identification of static and dynamic forces behavior {{as well as the}} determination of the most significant design parameters to eletromagnetic excitation forces. During the design development of a rotating machine the dynamic analysis involving evaluation of natural frequencies, damping factors and vibration modes are essential to estimate the active forces and the behavior of the system due to the application of these forces. Modal analysis technique is widely used when the objective is to solve inverse problems to obtain the dynamic properties of systems. However, when applied on rotating machines, some difficulties appear due the necessity of externally exciting the rotating system. The direct journal bearing <b>contact</b> <b>assembly,</b> in order to excite the system with an electromechanical exciter or shaker, presents significant limitations, due to friction effect on the shaft at higher rotational speeds.

40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for predicting the recommended insert thickness which {{will result in}} minimizing the thermal resistance of a pressed contact between flat, non-wavy, surfaces. The analysis {{is based upon the}} assumption of ideal plastic asperity deformations occurring at the interfaces formed between randomly high rough surfaces and the insert material. Experimental measurements of the thermal resistances for aluminium-tin-aluminium and stainless steel-tin-stainless steel, mechanically loaded assemblies corroborate within experimental error the predictions from the theory, and hence validate the analysis. 1 THE INVESTIGATION In order to either inhibit or enhance the thermal flow rates between contacting surfaces, suitable materials can be introduced between the surfaces. Such assemblies may consist of stacks of thin shims, as in electrical trans-formers (1) (2)) l and cryogenic tank supports (3), or in-volve surface coatings/foils for energy conservation and thermal controls in aerospace (4) -(9) and micro-electronic (10) (11) applications.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Focal {{adhesion}} {{sites are}} cell–matrix contacts that are regulated by phosphatidylinositol- 4, 5 -bisphosphate (PIP 2) -dependent pathways. Vinculin {{is a major}} structural component of these sites and {{is thought to be}} engaged in multiple ligand interactions at the cytoplasmic face of these contacts. Cytoplasmic vinculin is considered to be inactive due to its closed conformation involving intramolecular head–tail interactions. Recently, the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), a substrate of cyclic AMP-dependent or cyclic GMP-dependent kinases and a component of focal adhesion sites, was shown to bind to vinculin. Results: VASP–vinculin complexes could be immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and, using immunofluorescence, both proteins were found to colocalize in nascent focal adhesions. Consistent with the view that vinculin must be activated at these sites, we found that PIP 2, levels of which are elevated during the early stages of adhesion, bound to two discrete regions in the vinculin tail, disrupting the intramolecular head–tail interaction and inducing vinculin oligomerization. Vinculin–VASP complex formation was greatly enhanced by PIP 2 and both the EVH 1 and EVH 2 domains of VASP participated in vinculin binding. Conclusions: Focal <b>contact</b> <b>assembly</b> involves interaction between VASP and vinculin, which is enhanced by PIP 2 -induced vinculin activation and oligomerization. Given that vinculin and VASP both bind to F-actin, vinculin–VASP complexes might bundle the distal ends of actin filaments in focal contacts. We propose that PIP 2 -dependent signalling modulates microfilament organization at cellular adhesion sites by regulating vinculin–VASP complexes...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity of solid-state matter {{is a fundamental}} physical property and can be precisely derived from the resistance measured via the four-point probe technique excluding contributions from parasitic contact resistances. Over time, this method has become an interdisciplinary characterization tool in materials science, semiconductor industries, geology, physics, etc, and is employed for both fundamental and application-driven research. However, the correct derivation of the conductivity is a demanding task which faces several difficulties, e. g. the homogeneity of the sample or the isotropy of the phases. In addition, these sample-specific characteristics are intimately related to technical constraints such as the probe geometry {{and size of the}} sample. In particular, the latter is of importance for nanostructures which can now be probed technically on very small length scales. On the occasion of the 100 th anniversary of the four-point probe technique, introduced by Frank Wenner, in this review we revisit and discuss various correction factors which are mandatory for an accurate derivation of the resistivity from the measured resistance. Among others, sample thickness, dimensionality, anisotropy, and the relative size and geometry of the sample with respect to the <b>contact</b> <b>assembly</b> are considered.

40|$|Rabbit {{synovial}} fibroblasts (RSF) express basal {{levels of}} the metalloproteinases (MMP) collagenase, stromelysin- 1 and 92 -kD gelatinase when plated on intact fibronectin (FN), but elevated levels when plated on either the central RGD-containing cell-binding region of FN (120 FN) or antibody against the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin, suggesting that domains outside 120 FN may suppress the induction of MMP (Werb, Z., P. M. Tremble, O. Behrendtsen, E. Crowley, and C. H. Damsky. 1989. J. Cell Biol. 109 : 877 - 889). We therefore attempted to reconstitute the basal signaling of intact FN by plating RSF on 120 FN together with domains of FN outside this region. Large COOH-terminal fragments containing both the heparin-binding and HICS domains suppressed MMP when combined with 120 FN. To map the active sequences, peptides from this region and larger fragments that did, or did not, include the CS- 1 portion of IIICS were tested. Only CS- 1 peptide, or larger fragments containing CS- 1, suppressed MMP expression induced by 120 FN. In contrast, peptide V from the heparin-binding region, shown previously to stimulate focal contact formation, further enhanced MMP expression by RSF when present on the substrate with 120 FN. RSF expressed alpha 4 beta 1 integrin, the receptor for CS- 1, and the anti-alpha 4 mAb blocked the ability of CS- 1 to suppress MMP induction by 120 FN. These results show that signals modulating MMP expression and focal <b>contact</b> <b>assembly</b> are regulated independently, and that cooperative signaling by alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha 4 beta 1 integrins plays a dominant role in regulating expression of these extracellular matrix-remodeling genes in response to FN.

40|$|AbstractBackground: It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that {{the regulation of}} integrin vesicular traffic facilitates cell migration by internalizing integrins {{at the rear of}} the cell and transporting them forward within vesicles for exocytosis at the leading edge to form new contacts with the extracellular matrix. The rab family of GTPases control key targeting events in the endo/exocytic pathway; therefore, these GTPases may be involved in the regulation of cell-matrix <b>contact</b> <b>assembly.</b> Results: The endo/exocytic cycle of αvβ 3 and α 5 β 1 integrins was studied using mouse 3 T 3 fibroblast cell lines. In serum-starved cells, internalized integrins were transported through rab 4 -positive, early endosomes and arrived at the rab 11 -positive, perinuclear recycling compartment approximately 30 min after endocytosis. From the recycling compartment, integrins were recycled to the plasma membrane in a rab 11 -dependent fashion. Following treatment with PDGF, αvβ 3 integrin, but not α 5 β 1, was rapidly recycled directly back to the plasma membrane from the early endosomes via a rab 4 -dependent mechanism without the involvement of rab 11. This rapid recycling pathway directed αvβ 3 to numerous small puncta distributed evenly across the dorsal surface of the cell, and the integrin only became localized into focal complexes at later times following PDGF addition. Interestingly, inhibition of PDGF-stimulated αvβ 3 recycling using dominant-negative rab 4 mutants compromised cell adhesion and spreading on vitronectin (a ligand for αvβ 3), but adhesion to fibronectin (a ligand for α 5 β 1 and αvβ 3) was unchanged. Conclusions: We propose that growth factor-regulated, rab 4 -dependent recycling of αvβ 3 integrin from early endosomes to the plasma membrane is a critical upstream event in the assembly of cell-matrix contacts...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} to thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) {{correlates with}} assembly of cell–substratum contact structures that contain fascin microspikes. In this analysis, cell-matrix requirements for assembly of fascin microspikes {{were examined in}} detail. In six cell lines, cell spreading on a TSP- 1 substratum correlated with expression of fascin protein and formation of fascin microspikes. Microspikes were not formed by H 9 c 2 cells adherent on fibronectin, vitronectin, collagen IV, or platelet factor 4. However, both fascin microspikes and focal contacts were assembled by cells adherent on laminin- 1. Using mixed substrata containing different proportions of TSP- 1, and fibronectin, fascin microspike formation by H 9 c 2 and C 2 C 12 cells {{was found to be}} reduced on substrata containing 25 % fibronectin and abolished on substrata containing 75 % fibronectin. Adhesion to intermediate mixtures of TSP- 1 and fibronectin resulted in coassembly of fascin microspikes and focal contacts, colocalization of fascin with actin stress fiber bundles and altered distributions of β 1 integrins, cortical α-actinin, and tropomyosin. In cells adherent on 50 % TSP- 1 : 50 % fibronectin, GRGDSP peptide treatment decreased focal <b>contact</b> <b>assembly</b> and altered cytoskeletal organization but did not inhibit microspike assembly. Treatment with chondroitin sulfate A or p-nitrophenol β-d-xylopyranoside decreased microspike formation and modified cytoskeletal organization but did not inhibit focal contact formation. In polarized migratory and postmitotic C 2 C 12 cells, fascin microspikes and ruffles were localized at leading edges and TSP matrix deposition was also concentrated in this region. Depletion of matrix TSP by heparin treatment correlated with decreased microspike formation and cell motility. Thus, the balance of adhesive receptors ligated at the cell surface during initial cell–matrix attachment serves to regulate the type of substratum adhesion contact assembled and subsequent cytoskeletal organization. A role for fascin microspikes in cell motile behavior is indicated...|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{assumed that the}} {{coordinate}} assembly of desmosomal cadherins and plaque proteins into desmosome-typical plaque-coated membrane domains, capable of anchoring intermediate-sized filaments (IF), requires cell-to-cell contacts and a critical extracellular Ca 2 + concentration. To test this hypothesis we studied several cell lines grown for years in media with less than 0. 1 mM Ca 2 + to steady-state low Ca 2 + medium (LCM) conditions, particularly the human keratinocyte line HaCaT devoid of any junctional cell contact (HaCaT-L cells). Using immunolocalization and vesicle fractionation techniques, {{we found that the}} transmembrane glycoprotein, desmoglein (Dsg), colocalized with the plaque proteins, desmoplakin and plakoglobin. The sites of coassembly of desmosomal molecules in HaCaT-L cells as well as in HaCaT cells directly brought into LCM were identified as asymmetric plaque-coated plasma membrane domains (half-desmosomes) or as special plaque- associated cytoplasmic vesicles, most of which had formed endocytotically. The surface exposure of Dsg in these half-desmosomes was demonstrated by the binding, in vivo, of antibodies specific for an extracellular Dsg segment which also could cross-bridge them into symmetric quasi-desmosomes. Otherwise, these half-desmosomes were shown in LCM to be taken up endocytotically. Half-desmosomal assemblies were also seen in uncoupled cells in normal Ca 2 + medium. We conclude that, in the absence of intercellular <b>contacts,</b> <b>assembly</b> of desmosomal proteins at the cell surface takes place, resulting in transient half- desmosomes which then, in LCM and without a stable partner connection to the adjacent cell, can be endocytotically resumed. This frustrated cycle of synthesis and assembly maintains an ensemble of molecules characteristic of epithelial differentiation and the potential to form desmosomes, even when the final junctional structure cannot be formed.

Recently, we identified a complex of proteins containing the Na+,K+-ATPase, ankyrin, and fodrin in extracts of whole MDCK cells (Nelson, W. J., and R. W. Hammerton. 1989. J. Cell Biol. 108 : 893 - 902). We have now examined cell extracts for protein complexes containing the cell adhesion molecule uvomorulin. Proteins were solubilized from whole MDCK cells and fractionated in sucrose gradients. The sedimentation profile of solubilized uvomorulin is well separated from the majority of cell surface proteins, suggesting that uvomorulin occurs in a protein complex. A distinct portion of uvomorulin (30 %) cosediments with ankyrin and fodrin (approximately 10. 5 S). Further fractionation of cosedimenting proteins in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels reveals a discrete band of proteins that binds antibodies specific for uvomorulin, Na+,K+-ATPase, ankyrin, and fodrin. Significantly, ankyrin and fodrin, but not Na+K+-ATPase, coimmunoprecipitate in a complex with uvomorulin using uvomorulin antibodies. This result indicates that separate complexes exist containing ankyrin and fodrin with either uvomorulin or Na+,K+-ATPase. These results are discussed {{in the context of the}} possible roles of uvomorulin-induced cell-cell <b>contact</b> in the <b>assembly</b> of the membrane-cytoskeleton and associated membrane proteins (e. g., Na+,K+-ATPase) at the contact zone and in the development of cell polarity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a localization strategy for robotic assemblies with position uncertainty. The assembly of parts whose position uncertainty exceeds assembly clearance has {{to rely on}} either visual assistance or searching to achieve parts mating. We present a general strategy, applicable to arbitrary peg-in-hole assemblies, that localizes the misalignment of the mating parts in an efficient manner. The strategy explores the <b>assembly</b> <b>contact</b> configuration space and matches its observations to a pre-acquired C-space map. Simulations and experiments for various assembly scenarios are presented. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} extract instantaneous articulation from part geometry, based on surface mating constraints as well as constraints imposed by other incidental <b>contacts.</b> Many <b>assemblies</b> contain joints, each of which have degrees of freedom associated with them. These joints allow the relative positions of parts in the mechanism to change as the joints are articulated. Being able to represent these joints and their behavior is important from the designers perspective because it enables {{him or her to}} verify whether kinematic requirements have been met. Therefore, it is useful to be able to obtain such joint information directly from part geometry and contact physics. The method presented here handles all lower pairs of kinematic joints. Surface mating contacts are classified into one of three types: planar, spherical and cylindrical. The contacts are represented by algebraic inequalities describing the translational and angular velocities at the contact. Non-penetration co [...] ...|$|R
