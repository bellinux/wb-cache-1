40|$|The {{state of}} Pearl River Delta (PRD) {{regional}} air quality {{can be attributed}} to natural elements such as seasonal meteorological variability and anthropogenic factors such as pollutant emissions and physical influences exerted by urban morphology. A numerical study has been conducted to phenomenologically examine the breadth within which regional air quality can be adjusted by attenuating area-wide morphometry. Whilst urban parameterized (urbanized) mesoscale models have been successfully deployed for North American and European metropolises, this study deploys an urbanized meteorological model over a large, geographically complex mega-region, and at neighborhood scales. Differences in characteristic urban boundary layer features are evaluated for an urban fabric of high morphometric intensity and one of reduced intensity. Consequent air quality modeling results are compared. Firstly, formulation of the urban parameterization is introduced. Augmentations to traditional, surface layer similarity theory based formulations are highlighted. Secondly, a technique to extrapolate measured morphometry to the data-scarce PRD urban sites is shown. Then, a detail comparison of dynamical fields prognosticated for high and low urban morphometric intensities is presented. Differences in these dynamical fields are finally related to chemical transport modeling results. The urbanized model is able to exhibit detailed vertical evolution of physical properties {{from the bottom of the}} urban canopy layer up through the atmospheric boundary layer. Wind speed decreases with greater <b>canopy</b> <b>depth.</b> The canopy top TKE shear production peak is more pronounced in deep canopies.

Modelling and empirical studies {{have been used to}} better understand this relationship for the remote sensing of foliar biochemical concentration. The success of these studies have been predicated on two implicit assumptions; first, that variability in biochemical concentration and reflectance within any one canopy is small, and second, that foliar samples from a point (usually the top) of the canopy could be used to represent the canopy as a whole. To evaluate these two assumptions the three-dimensional variation of various biochemical and reflectance characteristics of a Sitka spruce canopy were examined. Biochemical concentrations varied with <b>canopy</b> <b>depth</b> and needle age: chlorophyll and cellulose concentrations increased slightly with <b>canopy</b> <b>depth,</b> water and lignin concentrations were greatest in the lower canopy, and nitrogen concentrations were similar throughout the canopy.

Simulation of DPAR interception by individual plant parts of a canopy, separately from direct beam {{photosynthetically active radiation}} (PAR), may give important insights into plant ecology. This paper presents a model to simulate the interception of DPAR in plant canopies. A sub-model of a virtual maize canopy was reconstructed. Plant surfaces were represented as small triangular facets positioned according to three-dimensionally (3 D) digitized data collected in the field. Then a second sub-model to simulate the 3 D DPAR distribution in the canopy was developed by dividing the sky hemisphere into a grid of fine cells that allowed for the anisotropic distribution of DPAR over the sky hemisphere. This model, DSHP (Dividing Sky Hemisphere with Projecting), simulates which DSH (Divided Sky Hemisphere) cells are directly visible from a facet in the virtual canopy, i. e. not obscured by other facets. The DPAR reaching {{the center of a}} facet was calculated by summing the amounts of DPAR present in every DSH cell. The distribution of DPAR in a canopy was obtained from the calculated DPARs intercepted by all facets in the canopy.

Arbequina, in Spain. Results reveal that orchard yield of hedgerows of rectangular shape reaches a maximum when <b>canopy</b> <b>depth</b> equals alley width (row spacing−canopy width) and decreases at wider spacing, and/or with wider canopies, as the length of productive row decreases per unit area. Maximum yields for 4 -m deep canopies were 2885 kg ha− 1 at 1 -m width and 5 -m row spacing, 2400 kg ha− 1 at 2 -m width and 6 -m spacing, and 2050 kg ha− 1 at 3 -m width and 7 -m spacing. Illumination of canopies can be increased by applying slopes to form rhomboidal hedgerows. Substantial yield advantage can be achieved, especially for wide hedgerows, partly by closer row spacing that increases row length per unit area. By comparison, responses to latitude in the range 30 – 40 ◦ are small and do not warrant different row spacing. Oil quality parameters also respond to orchard structure. Responses are presented for oleic and palmitic acid, stability, and maturity index. Oleic acid content declines as alley spacing increases and is smaller, shallow than in wide, deep canopies.

D.), Engineering Science, Washington State UniversityThis {{research}} {{made use}} of eddy covariance measurements and data collected in complex forest terrain to address questions regarding turbulence structure and scalar transport under weak wind and complex conditions. Two data sites were used to investigate the dependencies of mean turbulence under different conditions. The results show that <b>canopy</b> <b>depth</b> and wind speed influence degree of turbulence. In addition, there was influence from wind direction overnight at one site as overnight was more directly influenced by the sloped terrain. Similarities between daytime and nighttime turbulence and wind speed magnitude for daytime and nighttime did exist though the range of turbulence was lower overnight. The base turbulence structure was built around <b>canopy</b> <b>depth</b> and modulated by stability and wind direction. The level of intermittency of the turbulence was also determined through an intermittent fraction calculation with a case study to investigate the effects on the underlying structure. Aside from two very turbulent nights, the level of intermittency was relatively consistent at each height investigated. Connection between different time scales aided in the generation of higher turbulence periods and increased mixing. Investigation into the scalar fluxes was completed at the Priest River Experimental Forest site. The underlying terrain {{was linked to the}} scalar variation through its influences on the turbulence profile as it affects the scalar mixing. The evolution of temperature and water vapor created distinct periods of stratification that influenced how scalars were mixed generating distinct time periods throughout the day. The morning transition effects were more prominent on CO 2, and the evening transition effects more prominent on H 2 O while daytime and nighttime were dominated by turbulent mixing and advective effects, respectively. The evening and overnight in-canopy mixing would not be captured by above canopy measurements directly. The mixing was limited by the increased stratification so the effects near the ground were not translated to higher in the canopy even though wind speed and turbulence were not dissimilar.

40|$|In a {{preceding}} paper, {{a method}} {{was presented to}} estimate the diurnal courses of total, direct and diffuse radiation from total daily radiation only. In the present paper, these relations are introduced into a simulation model for daily canopy assimilation. With the assimilation—light response of single leaves, assimilation rates of sunlit and shaded leaf area are calculated in relation to vertical position within the canopy and time of day. Numerical integration over canopy layers and over the day yields the daily canopy assimilation. Neglecting variation in illumination intensity of the leaves overestimates assimilation due to the convex, asymptotic assimilation—light response. For an atmospheric radiation transmission of 0. 5 and a canopy with leaf area index of 5, daily canopy assimilation was overestimated by 2 % when only the mean leaf angle was considered, 7 % when all incoming light was treated as diffuse, 14 % when light intensity was averaged over the day, and 23 % when light absorption was averaged over canopy layers. These percentages increased sharply {{with an increase in}} atmospheric transmission. Neglecting the random variation in irradiance around the diurnal sine wave, overestimated assimilation by only 2 – 3 %. Daily canopy assimilation was approximated very closely by using a weighted average of the assimilation rates at only three selected <b>canopy</b> <b>depths</b> at three times of day.

Rarefaction curve slopes increased with regeneration time. Species composition differed among patches, with no nested pattern.

40|$|Vegetation impacts {{air quality}} and climate by {{emitting}} ozone precursors, known as {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC), and water vapor. The influence of these natural emissions depends on how efficiently they escape the forest layer. This dissertation examines our understanding of this escape using multi-scale models. First, sonic anemometer data and an updated chemical mechanism are incorporated into a 1 -D canopy model to improve the representation of near-canopy turbulence and VOC chemistry. The revised turbulence improves the vertical gradients in VOC, suggesting better escape, while the new chemistry scheme exacerbates VOC overestimates. The influence of canopy heterogeneity is evaluated by comparing vertically uniform and variable VOC emission potential distributions. The variable case con- strains light-induced VOC emissions to the upper canopy where more light is available, leading to higher emissions. As a practical implication of this result, accounting for heterogeneity enhances changes in VOC escape following succession. Lastly, land- and lake-atmosphere feedbacks in the Great Lakes region are simulated with a 3 -D regional climate model (RCM) coupled with a state-of-the-art land surface model (LSM). A moisture budget analysis reveals that evapotranspiration accounts for up to one-quarter of the local precipitation. However, the RCM does not fully capture the spatial variability in evapotranspiration, estimated by eddy covariance measurements at three field stations, potentially due to missing complexity in its response to surface conditions in LSM parameterizations. In conclusion, the forest-atmosphere exchange of biogenic VOC and water vapor, and thus the impact of vegetation on air quality and climate, is highly sensitive to complexities in surface layer processes, which are not adequately represented in current atmospheric models at both local and regional scales. Additional eddy covariance measurements at multiple <b>canopy</b> <b>depths</b> are needed to better characterize and improve model parameterizations of canopy turbulence and evapotranspiration. Land surface descriptions require more detailed vegetation data (e. g., stand height, age, and density) to account for vertical heterogeneity in VOC emissions...|$|R

Modeling studies to date typically represent the canopy as a single dominant tree type or a blend of tree types, yet many forests are diverse with trees of varying height.

In this case, high-isoprene-emitting foliage (e. g., aspen and oak) is constrained to the upper canopy, where higher sunlight availability increases the light-dependent isoprene emission, leading to 34 % more isoprene and its oxidation products {{as compared to the}} homogeneous simulation. Isoprene declines from aspen mortality are 10 % larger when heterogeneity is considered.

40|$|A {{spatially}} explicit mechanistic model, MAESTRA, {{was used}} to separate key parameters affecting transpiration to provide insights into the most influential parameters for accurate predictions of within-crown and within-canopy transpiration. Once validated among Acer rubrum L. genotypes, model responses to different parameterization scenarios were scaled up to stand transpiration (expressed per unit leaf area) to assess how transpiration might {{be affected by the}} spatial distribution of foliage properties. For example, when physiological differences were accounted for, differences in leaf width among A. rubrum L. genotypes resulted in a 25 % difference in transpiration. An in silico within-canopy sensitivity analysis was conducted over the range of genotype parameter variation observed and under different climate forcing conditions. The analysis revealed that seven of 16 leaf traits had a ≥ 5 % impact on transpiration predictions. Under sparse foliage conditions, comparisons of the present findings with previous studies were in agreement that parameters such as the maximum Rubisco-limited rate of photosynthesis can explain ∼ 20 % of the variability in predicted transpiration. However, the spatial analysis shows how such parameters can decrease or change in importance below the uppermost canopy layer. Alternatively, model sensitivity to leaf width and minimum stomatal conductance was continuous along a vertical <b>canopy</b> <b>depth</b> profile. Foremost, transpiration sensitivity to an observed range of morphological and physiological parameters is examined and the spatial sensitivity of transpiration model predictions to vertical variations in microclimate and foliage density is identified to reduce the uncertainty of current transpiration predictions...|$|E
40|$|Fluxes {{of carbon}} dioxide (CO 2), water, and energy {{measured}} using the eddy covariance method (EC) will vary spatially and temporally within the catchment area of the EC system, especially if parts of the forest are structurally heterogeneous. This is important because within site vegetation structural and topographic heterogeneity may tip the balance between an ecosystem being a net sink or source of CO 2 within a given year. Further, if wind directions are non-varying, the EC method may possibly either overor under-estimate energy and mass fluxes if source locations are not representative of the entire ecosystem. The following study will use airborne lidar assessments of canopy structure, a simple flux footprint parameterisation, and EC estimates of net ecosystem productivity (NEP), ecosystem respiration (Re), and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) {{to test the hypothesis}} that vegetation structural heterogeneity has some influence on CO 2 fluxes within a mature jack pine forest in Saskatchewan, Canada. The results found in this study indicate that vegetation structural variability (<b>canopy</b> height, <b>depth,</b> and foliage amount) within the site have significant influences on the variability in CO 2 flux estimates of uptake and respiration made using the EC method. However structural heterogeneity is not more important than meteorological driving mechanisms. The influences of structure may therefore become more influential in more heterogeneous ecosystems. Variability in vegetation fractional cover (a proxy indicator for foliag...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – The {{microwave}} observatory of subcanopy and subsurface (MOSS) {{project has}} been supported under the ESTO IIP to develop technologies for a SAR mission that provides global observations of soil moisture under substantial vegetation canopies and at useful depths. This VHF/UHF polarimetric SAR {{is designed to provide}} 7 - 10 day repeat observations of soil moisture under substantial vegetation <b>canopies</b> and at <b>depths</b> reaching 1 - 5 meters, at 1 Km resolution. Due to the rapid repeat cycle, the required swath width is 300 - 400 Km, which must be realized by a 30 m long antenna. Conventional array implementations would result in a mass of over 4000 Kg, whereas with the technology proposed and demonstrated in this project, the total antenna mass becomes about 400 kg. This antenna concept is implemented by a dual-stack patch array feed illuminating a 30 m mesh reflector to synthesize the require...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSpecies {{interactions}} are integral drivers of community structure and can change from competitive to facilitative with increasing environmental stress. In subtidal marine ecosystems, however, interactions along physical stress gradients have seldom been tested. We observed seaweed <b>canopy</b> interactions across <b>depth</b> and latitudinal gradients {{to test whether}} light and temperature stress structured interaction patterns. We also quantified interspecific and intraspecific interactions among nine subtidal canopy seaweed species across three continents to examine the general nature of interactions in subtidal systems under low consumer pressure. We reveal that positive and neutral {{interactions are}} widespread throughout global seaweed communities {{and the nature of}} interactions can change from competitive to facilitative with increasing light stress in shallow marine systems. These findings provide support for the stress gradient hypothesis within subtidal seaweed communities and highlight the importance of canopy interactions for the maintenance of subtidal marine habitats experiencing environmental stress...|$|R
