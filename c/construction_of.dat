40|$|This study {{analyzed}} {{literal and}} figurative <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> motherhood within Catherine Connors’ blog, Herbadmother. Texts for analysis included ten posts categorized by Connors under the label “feminism” when searching blog archives. I explored how these literal and figurative rhetorical <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> motherhood supported Connors aim of using her “mommy blog” {{to engage in}} a “radical feminist act. ” Literal <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> motherhood included: (1) the description of Connors as a mother in her own family and (2) the description of Connors as a daughter to her own mother. Figurative <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> motherhood included descriptions of Connors taking the role of metaphorical mother: (1) mother as defender of motherhood/patriarchal family, (2) mother as caregiver/teacher (3) mother as selfless, virtuous and noble. I conclude that Connors uses literal <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> motherhood for self-affirmation, identification, and authenticity. Additionally, Connors combines literal and figurative <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> motherhood in an “I/we” format in an effort to influence the larger practice of mommy blogging. By considering how Connors uses literal and figurative rhetorical <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> motherhood, I share notable patterns which suggest that Connors was able {{to draw attention to the}} collective identity of mommy bloggers as an influential community that resists connotations of illegitimacy or insignificance with which “mommies” and “bloggers” are often associated...|$|R

40|$|In Part I of this article, Dalton briefly {{reviews the}} way legal {{scholars}} commonly define sex-based discrimination, particularly {{as it pertains}} to issues of reproduction. Part II is a brief historical review <b>of</b> legal <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> parenthood. In Part III, Dalton examines two legal concepts: retroactive legitimation and presumed fatherhood. Both concepts were introduced in 1872 and each independently encouraged judges to think of fatherhood as consisting of two distinct spheres, the biological and the social. She then traces the legal development of these concepts through a series of presumed father, retroactive legitimation, and putative father cases. In Part IV Dalton extends the analysis to include legal <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> motherhood by introducing lesbian co-mother and female surrogacy cases into the mix. This allows the author to directly compare legal <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> motherhood to legal <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> fatherhood. In Part V Dalton discusses gendered aspects of the legal institution of marriage and the complicated role marriage plays in legal <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> parenthood. In Part VI she delves into several recent lesbian co-mother and surrogacy cases to explore how some judges are attempting to expand legal <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> motherhood in ways that would bring them more on par with legal <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> fatherhood. And finally, in Part VII, Dalton offers final remarks and concludes that judges 2 ̆ 7 inability to conceive of a gender neutral subject, at least when considering issues related to human reproduction, creates serious legal disadvantages for virtually all women. As the analysis below makes clear, the resulting discrimination is grounded in gendered <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> parenthood and not, as many courts conclude, in the biological differences between men and women...|$|R
