5|$|Goat Simulator is an {{open-ended}} third-person perspective {{game in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player <b>can</b> <b>let</b> the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E

25|$|The trio then confronts Paradox, who {{reveals that}} {{he comes from}} a future beyond Yusei's in which the world lies in ruins, and claims {{that the only way to}} fix it is to {{eliminate}} Duel Monsters from history. However, the three heroes protest that by doing so all the future events and people will be erased as well, and challenge him to a duel. By combining the powers of their key monsters, Yugi, Jaden and Yusei defeat Paradox, who disappears. After the duel, Yusei, Jaden and Yugi say that they will do what they can to make sure the future is not like Paradox's, and say goodbye and the latter two return to their respective time periods. New Domino City returns to normal, and Yusei finally <b>can</b> <b>let</b> go of the past and focus on the future.|$|E
25|$|Beginners tend {{to point}} with the rod {{to where they}} want to throw, but the {{movement}} of the hand has to be a controlled speed-up and then come to an abrupt stop. The rod will then start to unfurl and the tip of the rod will reach a high speed in the required direction. The high speed of the rod tip toward the target gives the impulse to make the cast, the abrupt stop and retreat of the rod tip is essential for the formation of a loop. Experienced fishermen also improve the speed of the line leaving the rod tip by a technique called hauling, applying a quick fast pull with the hand holding the line. At the end of the cast when the line is stretched the line as a whole will still have speed and the fisherman <b>can</b> <b>let</b> some extra line through their fingers making a false throw, either forward or backward or to finish the cast and start fishing.|$|E

500|$|A 30-second clip for the {{fragrance}} surfaced on the Internet in January 2014 and several publications reported and speculated {{it would be}} the commercial for Rise. A commercial was later officially released in February and was shot by Jake Nava with whom Beyoncé had collaborated frequently. It opens with shots of her showered in gold as she rises out of a glittering bowl formed of dust while dramatic music plays in the background; several of the scenes are filmed using a slow motion technique. Her voiceover is heard in the background, [...] "You <b>can</b> <b>let</b> yourself disappear, or you can stir things up. Never settle, shake loose. Embrace the elements.

500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work took roughly {{seven months}} to complete. Colby Parker Jr. served as editor, having previously worked with Berg on editing Battleship. Parker {{spent six months}} editing the film at the Lantana Entertainment Media Campus in Santa Monica, California. The editorial department used four Avid Media Composer systems to edit the film. Parker edited the film during principal photography, but was not on location. [...] "I like to blast through the footage {{to keep up with}} the camera.

500|$|In combat mode, {{the screen}} changes to a {{top-down}} mode with dimetric projection, where the player decides what actions the characters will take in each round. These actions are taken immediately, rather than after all commands {{have been issued}} as is standard in some RPGs. Optionally, the player <b>can</b> <b>let</b> the computer choose character moves for each round. Characters and monsters may make an extra attack on a retreating enemy that moves next to them. If a character's hit points (HP) fall below zero, {{he or she must}} be bandaged by another character or the character will die. The game contains random encounters, and game reviewers for Dragon magazine observed that random encounters seem to follow standard patterns of encounter tables in pen and paper AD game manuals. They also observed that the depictions of monsters confronting the party [...] "looked as though they had jumped from the pages of the Monster Manual." ...|$|E
500|$|Players {{can choose}} to talk to monsters instead of {{fighting}} them, in order to attempt to recruit them to their party. They can choose which of their characters {{they want to use}} to recruit monsters; the different characters vary in how easily they can recruit monsters. Players can also choose from their allied monsters when deciding which character they should use to recruit monsters. Players can use a type of magic called [...] "Combine" [...] to fuse two allied monsters into a single new monster; by doing this, players can get access to stronger monsters. In Last Bible II, players can increase the strength of their allied monsters by giving them accessories. In Last Bible III, players have access to a gauge that shows how the answers they give during conversations affect the monsters. The Demon Slayer includes an unlockable multiplayer mode in which two players <b>can</b> <b>let</b> their respective parties fight each other.|$|E
500|$|For {{simulating}} {{the behavior}} of crystals or other anisotropic materials, {{it is important to}} have variants of the curve-shortening flow for which the speed of flow depends on the orientation of a curve as well as on its curvature. One way of doing this is to define the energy of a curve to be the integral of a smooth function [...] of its normal vectors, and form the gradient flow of this energy, according to which the normal speed at which the curve flows is proportional to an anisotropic analog of the curvature. This flow can be simulated by discretizing the curve as a polygon. In numerical experiments, initial curves appear to converge to the Wulff shape for [...] before shrinking to a point. Alternatively, one <b>can</b> <b>let</b> the curve flow with speed [...] where [...] is the (usual) curvature and [...] and [...] are smooth functions of the orientation [...] When [...] and [...] (so that the flow is invariant under point reflection), the resulting flow can be shown to obey the avoidance principle and an analog of the Gage–Hamilton–Grayson theorem.|$|E

500|$|Mark Schilling of The Japan Times {{rated the}} film 5 out of 5 stars and {{observed}} that Summer Wars [...] "may contain familiar elements, beginning with its bashful, moonstruck young hero, but it combines them in ways fresh, contemporary and dazzlingly imaginative". He {{also said that}} the film provides a social commentary on the differences between an [...] "analog world" [...] and a [...] "realm of digital devices". Schilling titled his article [...] "The future king of Japanese animation may be with us; Hosoda steps out of Miyazaki's shadow with dazzling new film". He praised Sadamoto, Aoyama and Nishida for producing [...] "scenes of animated spectacle that, in their dazzling fluency of motion and untethered brilliance of invention, makes the usual SF/fantasy anime look childish and dull". Twitch Film published a review by Guillem Rosset who also referenced Miyazaki noting that following The Girl Who Leapt Through Time [...] "cries went out immediately hailing him [...] as the heir apparent". He claimed that with Summer Wars, [...] "Hosoda is the new king, the best story teller working within the animated medium in Japan and– quite possibly– the world." [...] Rosset praised the film itself as [...] "richly detailed and beautifully written...gorgeous to look at." [...] and [...] "blessed with an extensive cast of stunningly detailed and authentic characters." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "Hosoda has perfectly balanced the need to entertain via the visuals with the rich and satisfying character work that separates him from the massive pack of quality technicians to establish himself as truly a master story teller." [...] He also noted that [...] "The wonderful cast of characters is one of the film's greatest strengths" [...] while also highlighting that, of the virtual world of OZ, [...] "Here the creative minds of Madhouse <b>can</b> <b>let</b> their imagination run wild." [...] With regards to the technical aspects, Rosset called the film [...] "a top class audiovisual show." [...] He concluded by writing [...] "Mamoru Hosada deserves a place {{as one of the top}} contemporary Japanese animators. And it's good to know that once the time comes for Miyazaki to retire (not too soon I hope!) there's people capable of following his steps." [...] The Korean newspaper Herald Business saw the film's fantasy theme and gorgeous animation as a differentiator from works produced by Hollywood studios.|$|E

2500|$|The {{situation}} can be profitably {{compared to that}} which arises {{in the search for}} functions on the projective space P(V): in that setting, one would ideally like functions F on the vector space V which are polynomial in the coordinates of v≠0 in V and satisfy the equation F(cv)=F(v) for all non-zero c. Unfortunately, the only such functions are constants. If we allow denominators (rational functions instead of polynomials), we <b>can</b> <b>let</b> F be the ratio of two homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. Alternatively, we can stick with polynomials and loosen the dependence on c, letting F(cv)=c'k'F(v). The solutions are then the homogeneous polynomials of degree [...] On the one hand, these form a finite dimensional vector space for eachk, and on the other, if we let k vary, we can find the numerators and denominators for constructing all the rational functions which are really functions on the underlying projective spaceP(V).|$|E
