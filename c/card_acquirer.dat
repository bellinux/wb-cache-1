50|$|Acquisition of Blue Card has the {{following}} requirements. The applicant {{must have a}} work contract or binding job offer with a salary of at least 1.5 times the average gross annual salary paid in the Member State. A Blue <b>Card</b> <b>acquirer</b> must present a valid travel document (and in specific cases a valid residence permit or a national long-term visa) and documents proving the relevant higher professional qualification.|$|E
50|$|The size of {{the foreign}} {{exchange}} margin added using DCC varies depending on the DCC operator, <b>card</b> <b>acquirer</b> or payment gateway and merchant. This margin is in addition to any charges levied by the customer's bank or credit card company for a foreign purchase. In most cases, customers are charged more using DCC {{than they would have}} been if they had simply paid in the foreign currency.This is not necessarily the case however because the issuers also apply a spread when converting transactions from a foreign currency to the statement's currency.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{criticism}} lies in that compliance validation {{is required}} only for Level 1-3 merchants {{and may be}} optional for Level 4 depending on the <b>card</b> brand and <b>acquirer.</b> Visa's compliance validation details for merchants state that level 4 merchants compliance validation requirements are set by the acquirer, Visa level 4 merchants are [...] "Merchants processing less than 20,000 Visa e-commerce transactions annually and all other merchants processing up to 1 million Visa transactions annually". At the same time over 80% of payment card compromises between 2005 and 2007 affected Level 4 merchants; they handle 32% of transactions.|$|R
30|$|The {{exclusion}} {{restrictions that}} identify Eq. (1)—where the acquirer change in transaction volume per POS terminal with debit cards (ACTVPOS) is the dependent variable—are the merchant debit card discount fee and the debit card annual fee—which {{are expected to}} be negatively related to merchant transaction volumes- and an interaction term of the merchant acceptance and the total number of debit cards in that network. This interaction captures the network effects as ACTVPOS is expected to increase when the number of merchants served by the acquirer increases or the number of total debit cards increases. The exclusion restriction for ICTVDC corresponds to the annual debit card fee and the network effects shown by the interaction term of the merchant acceptance in the network and the number of cards issued by the bank. It {{is important to note that}} only 6  % of banks in the sample charge an annual fee for debit cards. 6 Even so, we exploit such variation to infer the impact of debit <b>card</b> fees on <b>acquirer</b> (Eq.  1) and issuer (Eq.  2) volumes. As for Eq. (3) the exclusion restrictions also include a price for that side of the market—the debit card ATM fees- and the interaction of the number of debit cards in the network and the number of ATMs by issuer, which is expected to show ATM network effects.|$|R
