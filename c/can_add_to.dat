5|$|As of {{the date}} above, no player has left the club with 99 career appearances; four – John Stone, Barry Lyons, Gary Bull and Malcolm Comrie – {{finished}} on 98. The list includes seven players who are still contracted to the club, and so <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> their totals.|$|E

5|$|Revelations: The Demon Slayer, Last Bible II, and Last Bible III are {{role-playing}} {{video games}} which all have similar gameplay. Players explore the game world and fight {{various types of}} monsters. During battles, players choose commands for their characters to do from a menu. Players can attack with both physical attacks and magic spells; different kinds of magic are effective against different types of monsters. Characters in players' party learn new spells {{throughout the course of}} the game. By defeating monsters, players gain experience points and money. As characters gain more experience points, players get access to points which he or she <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the characters' attributes; for instance, players can add points to a character's speed attribute, which allows that character to move earlier during battles. Players can use money that they've earned through battles to buy armor, weapons, and items, in shops found throughout the game world.|$|E
5|$|Barring Link's {{progress}} are creatures he must {{battle to}} locate the entrances to nine underground dungeons. Each dungeon is a unique, maze-like collection of rooms connected by doors and secret passages, and guarded by monsters different from those found on the surface. Dungeons also contain useful items which Link <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> his arsenal, such as a boomerang for retrieving distant items and stunning enemies, and a recorder with magical properties. Link must successfully navigate through {{each of the first}} eight dungeons to obtain all eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom. Once he has completed the artifact, he can enter the ninth dungeon to rescue Zelda. Apart from this exception, the order of completing dungeons is somewhat left to the player, although they steadily increase in difficulty and some of them can only be reached or completed using items gained in a previous one. In addition, the entrances of the three highest-level dungeons are hidden. Link can freely wander the overworld, finding and buying items at any point. This flexibility enables unusual ways of playing the game. For example, it is possible to reach the final boss of the game without ever receiving the first sword.|$|E

25|$|Each {{syndicate}} {{is responsible}} for determining how much money to hold in reserve for its known and unknown claim liabilities, and each may choose to release some of its reserves for prior-year claims if it deems it appropriate.

Other forms of contraception, {{such as the}} contraceptive patch, use the same synthetic estrogen (EE2) that is found in COCPs, and <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the hormonal concentration in the water when flushed down the toilet. This excretion is shown {{to play a role}} in causing endocrine disruption, which affects the sexual development and the reproduction, in wild fish populations in segments of streams contaminated by treated sewage effluents.|$|E
25|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{the bulk of}} coral reefs {{is made up of}} coral skeletons from mostly intact coral colonies. As other {{chemical}} elements present in corals become incorporated into the calcium carbonate deposits, aragonite is formed. However, shell fragments and the remains of calcareous algae such as the green-segmented genus Halimeda <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the reef's ability to withstand damage from storms and other threats. Such mixtures are visible in structures such as Eniwetok Atoll.|$|E
25|$|The odour of the peat-smoke, {{especially}} in winter time, <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the general {{atmosphere of the}} island. While peat burning still goes on, {{there has been a}} significant decline in recent years as people move to other, less labour-intensive forms of heating; however, it remains an important symbol of island life. In 2008, with the large increase in the price (and theft) of LPG and heating oil, there are signs {{that there may be a}} return to peat cutting.|$|E

25|$|The cyano {{group in}} HCN <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the {{carbonyl}} group to form cyanohydrins, R−CH(OH)CN. In this reaction the CN− ion is the nucleophile that attacks the partially positive carbon atom of the carbonyl group. The mechanism involves {{a pair of}} electrons from the carbonyl group double bond transferring to the oxygen atom, leaving it single bonded to carbon and giving the oxygen atom a negative charge. This intermediate ion rapidly reacts with H+, such as from the HCN molecule, to form the alcohol group of the cyanohydrin.|$|E
25|$|An artist {{may prefer}} a medium that stays fluid for some time, may want one that dries hard, or may want a medium that remains {{somewhat}} sticky. If the medium dries hard the artist can build up layers of color, which will fuse {{together in a}} single firing. This can create unusual intensity or depth of color. If the medium remains sticky the artist <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the design by dusting more color onto the surface, or can dust on an overglaze powder to create a high gloss surface.|$|E
25|$|Since {{turbulence}} at {{a surface}} {{is the source}} of wind noise, reducing gross turbulence <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> noise reduction. Both aerodynamically smooth surfaces, and ones that prevent powerful vortices being generated, have been used successfully. Historically, artificial fur has proved very useful for this purpose since the fibres produce micro-turbulence and absorb energy silently. If not matted by wind and rain, the fur fibres are very transparent acoustically, but the woven or knitted backing can give significant attenuation. As a material it suffers from being difficult to manufacture with consistency, and to keep in pristine condition on location. Thus there is an interest (DPA 5100, Rycote Cyclone) to move away from its use.|$|E

25|$|Saddles also {{vary with}} rider preference, from the {{cushioned}} ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow {{more room for}} leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist {{for male and female}} cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the overall weight of the bicycle.|$|E
25|$|While {{very common}} in citrus fruits, such as limes, citric acid is found only in very minute {{quantities}} in wine grapes. It often has a concentration about 1/20 that of tartaric acid. The citric acid most commonly found in wine is commercially produced acid supplements derived from fermenting sucrose solutions. These inexpensive supplements {{can be used by}} winemakers in acidification to boost the wine's total acidity. It is used less frequently than tartaric and malic due to the aggressive citric flavors it <b>can</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the wine. When citric acid is added, it is always done after primary alcohol fermentation has been completed due to the tendency of yeast to convert citric into acetic acid. In the European Union, use of citric acid for acidification is prohibited, but limited use of citric acid is permitted for removing excess iron and copper from the wine if potassium ferrocyanide is not available.|$|E
