5|$|In 1983, {{the right-wing}} Jörg Haider {{took over the}} {{leadership}} of the FPÖ's significant <b>Carinthia</b> branch. Its importance dated to the Kärntner Abwehrkampf (Carinthian defensive struggle) following World War I, and subsequent anti-Slavic sentiment arising from a fear of being taken over by Yugoslavia. Encouraged by the mass media, a struggle soon developed between Steger and Haider over the future of the party. In the 1985 Reder case, for instance, Haider staunchly supported FPÖ Minister of Defence Friedhelm Frischenschlager when the latter welcomed convicted Waffen-SS war criminal Walter Reder in person when Reder arrived at Graz Airport after his release from Italy. While the FPÖ struggled with its low support at the national level in the mid-1980s, this was {{in sharp contrast to the}} party's position in Haider's <b>Carinthia</b> (where the party had increased its support from 11.7% in the 1979 provincial election to 16% in 1984).|$|E

5|$|When Stephen {{attained}} the age {{of majority}} in 1257, his father appointed him Duke of Transylvania. Stephen's rule in Transylvania was short-lived, because his father transferred him to Styria in 1258.

Stephen and his father jointly invaded Styria and subdued the rebels. In addition to Styria, Stephen also received two neighboring countiesVas and Zalain Hungary from his father.

5|$|Although France had not {{completely}} defeated Austria, the Treaty of Schönbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, nevertheless imposed a heavy political {{toll on the}} Austrians.

5|$|As a consequence, Austria {{withdrew from}} the Coalition. Although France had not {{completely}} defeated them, the Treaty of Schönbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, imposed a heavy political, territorial, and economic price. France received <b>Carinthia,</b> Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to France's ally Poland. The Salzburg area went to the French ally, Bavaria. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20 percent of her total population, which dramatically reduced the military force that Austria could field. Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Joseph Bonaparte as the King of Spain, and affirmed Habsburg participation in Napoleon's Continental System. Francis reluctantly agreed to Napoleon's marriage with his daughter, Marie Louise, which Napoleon assumed, incorrectly, would eliminate Austria as a future threat.|$|E

Soon after the foundation of Maribor, the club was branded as the citizens club, while their city rivals Železničar Maribor has always been branded as the club of the working class. This was mainly because Maribor was seen, by the fans, as the successor of Branik Maribor, a club that folded in 1960. Many fans of Branik then started to cheer for Maribor, a club that was founded only couple of months later.|$|E

Charles signed a truce with them on 13December, and launched a new expedition against Austria early the next year. He forced the Babonići and the Kőszegis to yield, and the latter were also compelled to hand over to him their fortresses along the frontier in exchange for faraway castles.
