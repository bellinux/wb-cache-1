40|$|<b>Cooling</b> <b>water</b> {{systems are}} used to remove excess heat from a {{chemical}} process to the atmosphere. The primary components of these systems are the cooling tower and the heat exchanger network. There is a strong interaction between these individual components, thus their performances are interrelated. Most published {{research in this area}} has focused mainly on optimization of the individual components i. e. optimization of heat exchanger network or optimization of the cooling towers. This approach does not optimize the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system as a whole. Previous research work in which a holistic approach was used is limited to <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems with single <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> source. This work presents a technique for integrated optimization of complex <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems. The system under consideration consists of multiple cooling towers each supplying a set of heat exchangers. A superstructural approach is employed to explore all possible combinations between the heat exchangers and the cooling towers. The <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> reuse opportunities within the heat exchanger networks are also explored. A detailed mathematical model consisting of the cooling towers and the heat exchanger networks model is developed. Two practical scenarios are considered and the mathematical formulations for Case I and II yield nonlinear programing (NLP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) structure respectively. Although the reuse/recycle philosophy offers a good debottlenecking opportunity, the topology of the associated <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network is more complex, hence prone to higher pressure drop than the conventional parallel design. This is due to an increased network pressure drop associated with additional reuse/recycle streams. Therefore, it is essential to consider pressure drop during the synthesis of <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> networks where the reuse/recycle philosophy is employed. The on-going research in this area is only limited to <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> networks consisting of a single <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> source. The common technique used is mathematical optimization using either superstructural or non superstructural approach. This work further presents a mathematical technique for pressure drop optimization in <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems consisting of multiple cooling towers. The proposed technique is based on the Critical Path Algorithm and the superstructural approach. The Critical Path Algorithm is used to select the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with minimum pressure drop whilst the superstructural approach allows for <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> reuse. The technique which was previously used in a <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with single source is modified and applied in a <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network with multiple sources. The mathematical formulation is developed considering two cases. Both cases yield mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) models. The cooling tower model is also used to predict the exit condition of the cooling tower given the inlet conditions from the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> network model. The results show up to 29 % decrease in total circulating <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> flowrate when the <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> system is debottlenecked without considering pressure drop. Consequently, the overall cooling towers effectiveness was improved by up to 5 %. When considering pressure drop the results showed up to 26 % decrease in total circulating water flowrate.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports on}} the effective and efficient use of ozone in <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems. The study focuses on proving that ozone treated systems will: (1) Improve compressor energy consumption; (2) Improve the heat exchangers efficiency through limited scale deposition and fouling; (3) Reduce water consumption; and (4) Encourage or support corrosion at high concentrations compared to when <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> is chemically treated. For this study, data log readings from compressor heat exchanger approach temperatures were used for energy saving calculations and equipment efficiency (scaling). Using conservation of energy principles and municipal power costs, {{it was found that}} over four years, R 425 991 was saved. Conventional chemical <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems showed high approach temperatures, resulting in high scaling rates and high energy consumption in the compressors. In contrast, ozone <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems showed a lower approach temperatures which resulted in lower scaling rates and lower energy consumption in the compressors. Also, for this study data log readings from <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> flow rates and weekly water quality analyses were used for water saving calculation and corrosion predictions. In ozone <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems, there was a reduction in makeup water use confirming water savings. According to Mosugelo (2010) water quality is a bigger contributor to corrosion than ozone is. In <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems with good quality makeup water, ozone treated systems were found to have lower corrosion rates in the heat exchangers than conventional chemicals systems. It can be concluded that effective and efficient use of ozone in <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment provides triple bottom line benefits (economic, social and environmental). Environmental benefits include effluent disposal reduction, water and energy conservation. Social benefits include safety and health impacts. Ozone treated <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> systems are a technically practical, cost-effective and sensible alternative when compared to conventional <b>cooling</b> <b>water</b> treatment systems...|$|R

Experiments were conducted over an 8 -week period. Fish held in warm water had significantly higher growth (p 3 ̆c 0. 05), but condition factor, blood hematocrit, plasma glucose, and phagocytic capacity of macrophage cells were similar to fish held in <b>cool</b> <b>water.</b> Within the <b>cool</b> <b>water</b> groups (basal vs. supplemented diet), fish did not show any significant difference in condition factor, blood hematocrit, and phagocytic capacity of macrophage cells.
