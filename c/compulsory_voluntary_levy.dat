40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} various political mechanisms and the variation in unemployment compensation programs (i. e., <b>compulsory,</b> <b>voluntary,</b> and assistance programs). I argue that {{the choice of a}} specific unemployment compensation program over others depends on the level of franchise extension. Using a multinomial logit analysis of 13 European countries from 1880 to 1945, I find that among other political mechanisms, franchise extension had the greatest impact on the likelihood of instituting unemployment compensation, controlling socio-economic factors. Greater enfranchisement is associated with a higher probability of choosing a compulsory program, but not a voluntary one. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} an {{experiment}} comparing <b>compulsory</b> and <b>voluntary</b> voting institutions in a voting game with common preferences. Rational choice theory predicts sharp differences in voter behavior {{between these two}} institutions. If voting is compulsory, then voters may find it rational to vote insincerely, i. e., against their private information. If voting is voluntary so that abstention is allowed, then sincere voting in accordance with a voter’s private information is always rational while participation may become strategic. We find strong support for these theoretical predictions in our experimental data. Moreover, voters adapt their decisions to the voting institution in place {{in such a way}} as to make the group decision accuracy differences between the two voting institutions negligible. The latter finding may serve to rationalize the co-existence of <b>compulsory</b> and <b>voluntary</b> voting institutions in nature...|$|R

40|$|Using {{household}} panel data from Vietnam, this paper compares out-of-pocket health expenditures on outpatient care at a health facility between insured and uninsured patients {{as well as}} across various providers. In the random effects model, the estimated coefficient of the insurance status variable suggests that insurance reduces out-of-pocket spending by 24 % for those with the <b>compulsory</b> and <b>voluntary</b> coverage and by about 15 % for those with the health insurance for the poor coverage. However, the modest financial protection of the <b>compulsory</b> and <b>voluntary</b> schemes disappears once we control for time-invariant unobserved individual effects using the fixed effects model. Additional analysis of the interaction terms involving the type of insurance and health facility suggests that the overall insignificant reduction in out-of-pocket expenditures {{as a result of}} the insurance schemes masks wide variations in the reduction in out-of-pocket sending across various providers. Insurance reduces out-of-pocket expenditures more for those enrollees using district and higher level public health facilities than those using commune health centers. Compared to the uninsured patients using district hospitals, <b>compulsory</b> and <b>voluntary</b> insurance schemes reduce out-of-pocket expenditures by 40 and 32 %, respectively. However, for contacts at the commune health centers, both the compulsory health scheme and the voluntary health insurance scheme schemes have little influence on out-of-pocket spending while the health insurance scheme for the poor reduces out-of-pocket spending by about 15 %.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{study the}} impact of adding an explicit nil vote option to the ballot in both <b>compulsory</b> and <b>voluntary</b> voting settings. We investigate this issue in an informational voting setting, in which some voters are uninformed and face the swing voter’s curse, implying that they can only affect the expected election outcome adversely. We generate predictions using a simple model of strategic voting in which some voters receive a psychological benefit (along the lines of Riker and Ordeshook (1968)) from choosing an action that they consider a legitimate participation in the election. We test our model in a double-blind pen-and-paper laboratory experiment, and find that the main comparative predictions of the model hold in the data, particularly strongly for compulsory voting. In particular, both under <b>compulsory</b> and <b>voluntary</b> voting, introducing a nil vote option reduces the number of uninformed voters casting a vote for a candidate, increasing voters’ expected welfare. Additionally, it eradicates strategic invalid votes under compulsory voting...|$|R
