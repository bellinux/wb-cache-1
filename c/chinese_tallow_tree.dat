50|$|In 1900, up to {{one million}} Attwater's prairie {{chickens}} inhabited the coastal grasslands. Loss of habitat {{is believed to be}} the prime reason for their decline. One of the major factors contributing to the habitat loss was the widespread planting, beginning in the early 1900s, of <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> <b>trees</b> (Triadica sebifera) to establish a soapmaking industry. Since that time, T. sebifera has proven to be an aggressive invader of the coastal grasslands where it displaces the diverse native plant assemblage that was dominated by prairie grasses and forbs with dense near monospecific stands, that significantly alter biotic and abiotic ecosystem processes. Urbanization further contributes to habitat loss. As a result of these changes over the last 100 years, the entire grassland ecosystem where Attwaters's prairie chicken once thrived exists in small, scattered patches whose continued existence is threatened. Where once grazing Plains bison and periodic wildfires due to lightning reduced brush, the birds now have difficulty making their way through thick undergrowth. Other, less-apparent changes in the ecosystem possibly have had an effect, as well.|$|R

He received his AB from Cornell University in 1990 and his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in 1997. The focus of his research has been investigating how local environmental factors (e.g. enemies, resources, disturbance regime and recruitment limitation) interact with post-invasion adaptation to determine the likelihood and severity of <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> (Sapium sebiferum) invasions into East Texas coastal prairie, mesic forests, and floodplain forests. The results of this research have been highlighted in Science Daily, Environmental News Service, and The Sciences.

50|$|Although {{native to}} China and Japan, {{the plant is}} also found {{where it has been}} {{introduced}} in the southeastern United States, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Taiwan, India, Martinique, Sudan, and southern France. Incorrectly thought to have been introduced in colonial times by Benjamin Franklin, the tree has become naturalized from North Carolina southward along the Atlantic and the entire Gulf coast, where it grows profusely along ditchbanks and dikes. It grows especially well in open fields and abandoned farmland coastal prairie regions featuring disturbed ground—such as abandoned farmland, spoil banks, roadsides, and storm-damaged forests—and along the edges of the Western Gulf coastal grasslands biome, sometimes forming pure stands. In the Houston area, Chinese tallow trees account for a full 23 percent of all trees, more than any other tree species and is the only invasive tree species in the 14 most common species in the area. The Texas Department of Agriculture lists Chinese Tallow as one of the 24 most invasive plants, and includes Chinese Tallow in a list of Noxious and Invasive Plants which are illegal to sell, distribute or import into Texas. Herbivores and insects have a conditioned behavioral avoidance to eating the leaves of <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> <b>tree,</b> and this, rather than plant toxins, may be a reason for the success of the plant as an invasive.|$|E

40|$|Airborne color-infrared {{photography}} (CIR) (1 : 12, 000 scale) {{was used}} to map localized occurrences of the widespread and aggressive <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> (Sapium sebiferum), an invasive species. Photography was collected during senescence when <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow's</b> bright red leaves presented a high spectral contrast within the native bottomland hardwood and upland forests and marsh land-cover types. Mapped occurrences were conservative because not all senescing tallow leaves are bright red simultaneously. To simulate low spectral but high spatial resolution satellitelairborne image and digital video data, the CIR photography was transformed into raster images at spatial resolutions approximating 0. 5 m and 1. 0 m. The image data were then spectrally classified for the occurrence of bright red leaves associated with senescing <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow.</b> Classification accuracies were greater than 95 percent at both spatial resolutions. There {{was no significant difference}} in either forest in the detection of tallow or inclusion of non-tallow trees associated with the two spatial resolutions. In marshes, slightly more tallow occurrences were mapped with the lower spatial resolution, but there were also more misclassifications of native land covers as tallow. Combining all land covers, there was no difference at detecting tallow occurrences (equal omission errors) between the two resolutions, but the higher spatial resolution was associated with less inclusion of non-tallow land covers as tallow (lower commission error). Overall, these results confirm that high spatial (51 m) but low spectral resolution remote sensing data can be used for mapping <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> <b>trees</b> in dominant environments found in coastal and adjacent upland landscapes...|$|R
50|$|As aforementioned, the <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> is a {{non-native}} {{species to}} many {{places around the}} world. Its introduced status in North America along with the harm it causes to ecosystems makes the tree considered an invasive species there. <b>Tallow</b> <b>trees</b> present a danger of expansion that can hurt local ecosystems by out-competing native vegetation and creating a monoculture. The monoculture would then lower the species diversity and overall resilience of the area. The tree’s tenacious nature, high growth rates, and high reproductive ability contribute to its invasive success. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, <b>tallow</b> <b>trees</b> begin producing viable seed in as soon as three years. They can spread by root sprouts and cuttings and are quick to invade after a disturbance occurs in an area, due to the clearing out of land. A single <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> can produce nearly 100,000 viable seeds annually that can remain in the soil for several years before sprouting. A mature stand can produce 4,500 kilograms of seeds per hectare per year. These seeds are easily carried to different places by birds and water. <b>Tallow</b> <b>trees</b> can remain productive for 100 years. It is also extremely hard to kill—its poisonous features in its leaves and berries leave it with few to no predators, and its short generation time means even freshly cut trees can quickly regrow. Currently, herbicides and prescribed fire are the only effective treatments available to contain and control <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} flooding adaptation {{mechanisms of}} baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) Rich.) and <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> (Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb.), we designed field experiments {{to examine the}} changes of morphology, growth, aerenchyma formation, porosity and root O 2 consumption of one-year-old seedlings of both species. Both trees {{were divided into two}} groups. One group was not flooded (NF, soil water content was 75 % of field capacity), while the other group was treated with flooding (FL, water level was 5 cm above soil surface) for 95 days. We found that flooding inhibited growth of both baldcypress and <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> <b>tree,</b> and biomass increment of baldcypress and <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> under FL decreased 36. 4 % and 74. 5 %, respectively, indicating that baldcypress was more tolerant to flooding. Root/shoot ratio of the two tree species increased significantly under flooding, which was primarily due to the decrease of stem and leaf biomass. Flooding also stimulated aerenchyma formation in the roots (lateral and adventitious), stems and leaves of baldcypress and roots of <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> <b>tree.</b> Porosity in the roots, stems and leaves of the two tree species increased significantly under flooding. The aerenchyma formation and increased porosity enhanced O 2 diffusion to the roots. Our results indicate that baldcypress and <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> <b>tree</b> exhibit a number of adaptive mechanisms in response to flooding, including formation of adventitious roots and new lateral ones, aerenchyma formation, increased porosity of the roots, stems and leaves, and increased O 2 release into the rhizosphere...|$|E

40|$|Global {{climate change}} and {{anthropogenic}} activity have facilitated the movement and invasive potential of nonnative plants in native environments. These invasions can have negative effects on ecosystem diversity and function. The nonnative and invasive plant, <b>Chinese</b> <b>Tallow</b> (Triadica sebifera), has already invaded much of the south eastern US where it is outcompeting native tree species and changing ecosystem diversity {{in a variety of}} habitats. Leaf litter from the <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> has been shown cause changes in dissolved oxygen and pH in the aquatic environment. Turbidity is also affected when <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter is present in water. A series of experiments were performed to determine the causes of these chemical changes in water when <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter is present. I determined that <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter has a different chemical composition from native litter, a different concentration of essential soluble nutrients from native litter, and a faster decomposition rate compared to native plant litter. Sterilization experiments suggest that <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter is promoting microbial activity through the rapid release of elemental nutrients, which subsequently influences a change in dissolved oxygen thorough stimulated microbial respiration. Changes in pH are not fully understood, but sterilization experiments suggest that unknown secondary chemicals, perhaps tannins and phenolic compounds, are the source of declining pH when <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter is present in water. Using high throughput 16 s and 18 s rRNA mass parallel gene sequencing, followed by Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling ordination scatter plots, I determined that <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> litter can promote differences in microbial community composition from that of native plant litter. NMDS ordination scatter plots demonstrate that both bacterial and fungal communities were different in <b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> treatments when compared to native plant litter treatments.

We hypothesize that broad variation in average reinvasion pressure of Triadica sebifera (<b>Chinese</b> <b>tallow</b> <b>tree,</b> a major invader) arises from differences among habitats in spatiotemporal availability of realized recruitment windows. These windows are periods of variable duration {{long enough to}} permit establishment given local environmental conditions. We tested this hypothesis via a greenhouse mesocosm experiment that quantified how the duration of favorable moisture conditions prior to flood or drought stress (window duration), competition and nutrient availability influenced Triadica success in high stress environments. Window duration influenced pre-stress seedling abundance and size, growth during stress and final abundance; it interacted with other factors to affect final biomass and germination during stress. Stress type and competition impacted final size and biomass, plus germination, mortality and changes in size during stress. Final abundance also depended on competition and the interaction of window duration, stress type and competition. Fertilization interacted with competition and stress to influence biomass and changes in height, respectively, but did not affect Triadica abundance.
