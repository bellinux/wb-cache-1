40|$|<b>Chlorozotocin</b> is a chloroethylnitrosourea {{antitumor}} {{agent that}} is in clinical trial {{for a variety of}} human tumors. Renal failure has been a reported side effect of treatment with several of the chloroethylnitrosoureas, including <b>chlorozotocin.</b> To better understand the pathogenesis of this target organ toxicity, we have studied the nephrotoxicity of a single high, intermediate, or low dose of <b>chlorozotocin</b> in male F 344 rats. We report here the sequence of histopathologic changes seen over a 1 - 10 -day (high dose) or 1 - 28 -day (intermediate or low dose) period. The single high dose (40 mg/kg, s. c.) produced an acute cortical necrosis involving the proximal tubules, followed by later necrotic changes in the collecting ducts in the inner medulla. Karyomegaly was noted at 10 days in occasional cells of the papillary collecting ducts and urinary epithelium lining the pipilla. A single intermediate dose (25 mg/kg, s. c.) caused a similar but less severe injury of later onset. Proximal tubule injury was less severe and more limited. Necrosis of papillary collecting ducts was not seen; however, karyomegaly was pronounced in cells of the collecting ducts in the inner stripe of the outer medulla and inner medulla, and in the urinary epithelium covering the papilla. No discernible histopathology was present following the low dose (12. 5 mag, s. c.) of <b>chlorozotocin.</b> The histopathology was correlated with biochemical parameters. Our findings have possible implications for monitoring the severity of nephrotoxic side effects in patients, as well as provide preliminary evidence that this antineoplastic agent may itself cause preneoplastic changes, a finding with important long term implications...|$|E
40|$|<b>Chlorozotocin</b> {{is a new}} {{nitrosourea}} anti-tumour {{drug that}} does not produce bone marrow suppression at therapeutic doses in mice. CDF 1 mice which were injected i. p. with a dose lethal to 10 % of animals within 60 days (LD 10), 20 mg/kg, developed a 50 % reduction in circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes without a decrease in circulating granulocytes by day 3. Spleen weight also decreased markedly. The percentage of spleen B and T cells, determined by immunofluorescence with goat anti-mouse IgG and rabbit anti-mouse brain antisera, {{did not differ in}} control and chlorozotocin-treated mice. However, the ability of residual spleen cells to proliferate in response to phytohaemagglutinin, concanavalin A, pokeweed mitogen, and allogeneic cells was significantly suppressed although the lipopolysaccharide response was not reduced. The ability of the mice to respond to a primary immunization with sheep red blood cells was not significantly impaired. Therefore, <b>chlorozotocin</b> has a cytotoxic effect on both B and T cells but selectively inhibits the proliferative capacity of T cells. B cell proliferation and B cell function as measured in a primary antibody response were not reduced. These studies suggest <b>chlorozotocin</b> may be useful as an immunosuppressive drug as well as an anti-tumour agent...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} of clonal subpopulations {{isolated from the}} RIF- 1 mouse sarcoma to melphalan treatment is independent of cell ploidy, whereas a clear relationship exists between ploidy and cell sensitivity to CCNU treatment. In the present study RIF- 1 clones {{have been exposed to}} nitrogen mustard, aniline mustard and chlorambucil, and to nitrosoureas BCNU, MeCCNU and <b>chlorozotocin,</b> in order to evaluate whether or not the different physiochemical and biological activities of these agents would affect the patterns of drug sensitivity obtained for melphalan and CCNU. Irrespective of the different lipophilicities, transport properties and chemical reactivities of the nitrogen mustards, RIF- 1 clones showed the same pattern of sensitivity as previously observed for melphalan. Similarly, RIF- 1 clones when exposed to nitrosoureas BCNU, MeCCNU and <b>chlorozotocin,</b> showed the same pattern of sensitivity as that obtained for CCNU exposure. These data suggest (a) that the variation in the sensitivity of RIF- 1 clones to treatment by the nitrogen mustards is unlikely to reflect differences in either membrane permeability or in drug transport and (b) that the ploidy dependent nitrosourea responses shown by RIF- 1 clones similarly do not reflect differences in drug uptake...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{relative}} mutagenic {{activities of}} chloroethyl-nitrosourea and methylnitrosourea antitumor agents in active clinical use were determined {{with the use}} of the Ames Sa/-monella typhimurium assay. The results indicated that the drugs induced base substitutions. 2 -Deoxy- 2 - [[(methyl nitrosoamino}car-bonyl]amino]-o-glucopyranose (also called streptozotocin), a glu-cose-containing methylnitrosourea, was the most mutagenic of all compounds tested and showed at least a 2 S 0 -fold increase in activity when compared to that of its chloroethyl analog, 2 -[[[(2 -chloroethyl} nitrosoamino] carbonyl]-amino]- 2 -deoxy- 0 -g lucose (also called <b>chlorozotocin).</b> All nitrosoureas, with the exception of N'-[(4 -amino- 2 -methyl-S-pyrimidinyl}methyl]-N-(2 -chloroethyl}-N-nitrosourea monohydrochloride, a pyrimidine chloroethyl ana-log, demonstrated an increase in mutagenicity after incubation with induced Sprague-Dawley rat liver microsomes.

GANU has significant activity against P 388 leukemia and TLX 5 lymphoma, and also against the solid tumors B 16 melanoma and Lewis lung carcinoma; pulmonary metastases of this tumor are particularly sensitive {{to the effects of}} GANU. The effects of GANU on TLX 5 lymphoma and Lewis lung carcinoma are less pronounced than those of BCNU and CCNU, as already reported for L 1210 leukemia. In contrast with other results obtained with this tumor, <b>chlorozotocin</b> has a less pronounced effect than GANU, and virtually none in lung metastases of Lewis lung carcinoma...|$|E
40|$|Chinese hamster V 79 lung {{fibroblasts}} express {{low levels}} (specific activity 2 — 4 fmol/mg protein) of 06 -alkylguanine (CP-AG) alkyttransferase (ATase). In cells surviving selection with low doses (10 /ig/ml) of the chloroethylating agent, mito-zolomide (Mz), ATase activity was increased 5 - to 8 -fold. Repeated selection of such cells produced a maximal specific activity of 36 — 40 fmol/mg protein, whilst selection at 20 or 40 /ig/ml result in specific activities of ~ 50 and 70 fmol/mg respectively. Only slight decreases in ATase activity were seen by 51 days {{after an initial}} selection with 10 /ig/ml Mz. A similar effect was observed using <b>chlorozotocin.</b> Selected cells had a higher D 37 for Mz (2. 5 - 6. 0 /xg/ml) in comparison with control cell (D 37, 0. 8 /tg/ml) but the D 37 s for nitrogen mus-tard and vincristine were closely similar in selected and con-trol cells.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that 1 -(4 -amino- 2 -methylpyrimidine- 5 -yl) -methyl- 3 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -nitrosoureahydrochloride (ACNU) and 1,(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -cyclohexyl- 1 -nitrosourea (CCNU) bind specifically to the nucleosomal DNA of murine bone marrow and L 1210 leukaemia cells whereas the glucose nitrosoureas, 2 -(3 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -nitrosoureido) - 2 -deoxy-D-glucopyranose, (<b>chlorozotocin,</b> CLZ) and 1 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -(-D-glucopyranosyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (GANU), bind preferentially to the linker DNA of bone marrow but not tumour cell chromatin. In order to provide an explanation for this differential, the DNA repeat and linker lengths in murine bone marrow and L 1210 leukaemia cells were measured using electrophoresis of micrococcal nuclease-digested DNA. The linker length of bone marrow chromatin was approximately 22 % longer than that in L 1210 leukaemia cells from mouse ascites. The linker length of L 1210 cells maintained in suspension culture was 27 % less than in those from ascites fluid. The tissue-specific toxicity of sugar nitrosoureas and the differential binding of these drugs to chromatin does not appear to correlate quantitatively with differences in DNA linker length...|$|E
40|$|Summary We have {{investigated}} the relationships between nitrosourea structure and physicochemical properties {{and the ability of}} misonidazole (MISO) to potentiate nitrosourea cytotoxicity in an in vitro model system. EMT- 6 /Ro tumour cells were exposed in suspension to each of 9 different nitrosourea anti-tumour drugs under hypoxic and aerobic culture conditions. Additional cultures were similarly treated with nitrosoureas in the presence of 1. 0 mM MISO. Seven of the 9 nitrosoureas did not demonstrate any selective toxicity toward aerobic or hypoxic cells. In contrast, <b>chlorozotocin</b> (CHLZ) was slightly more toxic toward hypoxic cells while Bis-OH CyNU more effectively killed aerobic cells. The addition of MISO to the drug treatment enhanced the effectiveness of all the nitrosoureas under hypoxic conditions, with the exception of CHLZ which was uninfluenced by MISO. The magnitude of the MISO dose enhancement factor (DEF, defined as the ratio of drug doses required to reduce cell survival to S = 10 - 3 in 4 hours in the absence and presence of 1. 0 mM MISO) for each combination was examined {{as a function of the}} relative carbamoylating or alkylating activity of the nitrosourea included in that combination.

40|$|Summary An {{increasing}} number of reports highlight the fact that tumour cells are able to give rise in vitro to immunogenic variants, which are defined in vivo as being non tumorigenic, tum-. We have observed the emergence of immunogenic variants, derived from a primary nickel-induced rat rhabdomyosarcoma established in culture (RMS 9 - 4 / 0), resistant to treatment with the chloronitrosourea, <b>chlorozotocin</b> (CZT) (Rlines). They were separated from the whole population of cells by a cloning procedure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cloning procedure by itself allows the isolation of tum- variant designated as C-lines. In both cases, the tum- phenotype was observed after s. c. injection of cells into syngeneic rats with {{a broad range of}} R 9 or C 8 cells (104 to 107). This characteristic was inherited in a stable manner. Athymic mice developed tumours of rat rhabdomyosarcoma origin when grafted with 105 cells. Immunization of rats with one R variant (R 9) tum- protected the rats grafted with the parental RMS 9 - 4 / 0 cells against metastatic invasion of the lungs, but not against local tumour growth, and rats grafted with a CZT-resistant tum+ cell variant S 4 T (in vivo-derived) against its hepatic and pulmonary metastases, while the local tumour progressed as usual. Immunization of rats with one C variant (C 8) tum- cells did not protect them against either metastases or local growth of the implanted tumours.

40|$|Rats {{bearing a}} transplanted nickel-induced {{rhabdomyosarcoma}} (RMS 9 - 4 / 0), treated with <b>chlorozotocin</b> (CZT), an alkylating agent, showed an amplified metastatic {{invasion of the}} lung (median of 165 lung tumour nodules, compared to 3 for untreated controls). A higher level of metastatic invasion (200 nodules) was reached spontaneously after the grafting of the S 4 T line, which was obtained by successive in vivo passages of RMS 9 - 4 / 0 cells in CZT treated rats. S 4 T tumour cells also invaded the liver and a considerable proportion of the lymph nodes. The NT 4 T line, obtained by successive in vivo passages in untreated rats, showed a lesser degree of enhancement of metastatic capacity (57 nodules). Both derived lines {{proved to be more}} aggressive than the parental, proliferated more rapidly, and were resistant to CZT toxicity. Only the non-treated lineage became more resistant to NK lysis. The S 4 T line lost its myogenic differentiation and was best described as a fibrohistiosarcoma, whereas NT 4 T did not. Chromosome analysis demonstrated a reduced range of chromosome number per cell in both lines. We conclude that both S 4 T and NT 4 T tumours became more metastatic than RMS 9 - 4 / 0 as the result of tumour progression through in vivo passages, and that in addition S 4 T acquired a spontaneously higher metastatic potential, similar to that which occurred in rats grafted with RMS 9 - 4 / 0 or NT 4 T tumours and treated by CZT. This suggests an inheritable mutation in the S 4 T line...|$|E

Splenic lymphocyte transfer from immune rats into nude mice, i. e., the Winn test, showed a complete degree of protection against C 8 or R 9 tumour growth. We conclude that two different antigenicities were revealed, one common to R 9 and C 8 cells in relation with their selection procedure by repeated cloning. Another antigenicity appeared in the R 9 line, selected by CZT-resistance. The anti R 9 cell immunization against CZT-resistant tum+ S 4 T could argue in favour of CZT action in the acquisition of R 9 cell antigenicity. More likely, an amplification of antigens rather than induction of a new antigen could explain the protection of anti R 9 immunized rats against parental tumour metastases...|$|E
