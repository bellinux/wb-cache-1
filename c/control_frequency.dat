30|$|Over {{the last}} few years, lots of attentions {{have been given to}} the demand {{response}} (DR) for the <b>frequency</b> <b>control.</b> DR can be incorporated with traditional <b>frequency</b> <b>control</b> method and enhance the stability of the system. In this paper, the <b>frequency</b> <b>control</b> strategy of DR for a multi-area power system is specially designed. In order to quickly stabilize the frequency of different areas, the tie-line power is adopted as the additional input signal of DR. To get the optimal parameters of the <b>control</b> system, the <b>frequency</b> <b>control</b> problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, and the parameters such as the integral gains of secondary <b>frequency</b> <b>control,</b> the <b>frequency</b> bias parameters, and coefficients of DR are optimized. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.|$|R
500|$|In February 1976, Fleetwood Mac convened at the Record Plant in Sausalito, California, with hired {{engineers}} Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut. Production duties were {{shared by}} the three parties, while the more technically adept Caillat was {{responsible for most of}} the engineering; he took a leave of absence from Wally Heider Studios in Los Angeles on the premise that Fleetwood Mac would eventually use their facilities. The set-up in Sausalito included a number of small recording rooms in a large, windowless wooden building. Most band members complained about the studio and wanted to record at their homes, but Fleetwood did not allow any moves. Christine McVie and Nicks decided to live in two condominiums near the city's harbour, while the male contingent stayed at the studio's lodge in the adjacent hills. Recording occurred in a six-by-nine-metre room which included a 3M 24-track tape machine, a range of high-quality microphones, and an API mixing console with 550A equalisers; the latter were used to <b>control</b> <b>frequency</b> differences or a track's timbre. Although Caillat was impressed with the set-up, he felt that the room lacked ambience because of its [...] "very dead speakers" [...] and large amounts of soundproofing.|$|E
