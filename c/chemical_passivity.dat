40|$|A typical hot {{concentrated}} alkaline corrosion environment {{exists in}} alumina metallurgical industry, so that steel materials with outstanding alkaline corrosion resistance are strongly demanded for its processing equipment. In this paper, the corrosion resistance of {{two kinds of}} martensitic cast steels containing chromium in static 303 g/L NaOH alkaline solution at 85 ℃ was studied through polarization and potential-time curves, corrosion weight loss and corrosion morphology analysis. Experimental results showed that protection effect by passive film of cast steel containing Cr was temporary. The low carbon steel without Cr content also exhibited <b>chemical</b> <b>passivity</b> in the same solution. The corrosion mode of the tested Cr-containing cast steel was composed of active dissolving corrosion and caustic embrittlement cracking. Dissolving corrosion was the primary mechanism for the induced weight loss, while severe caustic embrittlement cracking was secondary. With the increase of chromium content in the cast steel, the tendency of the caustic embrittlement cracking decreased, while the active dissolving corrosion increased...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{advantages}} of ceramics, with their high corrosion stability in vivo, most medical implant constructions are still made from metals [1]. To increase the corrosion stability of metals, different coatings are applied to the implant surfaces, typically such coatings are the oxides of the metals in the implants [2]. For an oxide film to have protective properties it must satisfy the following requirements: • to be unbroken and pore-free; • to have good adhesion with the metal; • to have a thermal expansion constant near to the value for the metal; • to be chemically inert in different environments; • to be hard and have minimal wear under load. The oxides of metals such as Al, Ti, Zr, Nb and Ta satisfy all these properties to some degree [3 – 5]. Indeed, some of these metal oxides are used in medicine independently without a metal substrate, such as implant constructions from sapphire (a single-crystal modification of Al 2 O 3) [6, 7]. Titanium is {{the most widely used}} material for medical implant manufacture [8]. Its <b>chemical</b> <b>passivity</b> is provided by the oxide film (TiO 2), covering the entire free surface; a result of titanium contact with air. But titanium is unable to satisfy all the requirements necessary for an implant material because of its insufficient corrosion stability [9 – 11]. The application of combined implants consisting of a metal base and a ceramic coating also does not give a complete solution to the problem, because of the low adhesion strength and fragility of ceramic coatings [12, 13]...|$|E
40|$|For {{clinical}} implantation {{purposes of}} shape memory metals the nearly equiatomic nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloy is generally used. In this study, the corrosion properties and surface characteristics of this alloy were investigated and compared with two reference controls, AISI 316 LVM stainless steel and Ti 6 Al 4 V. The anodic polarization curves, performed in Hanks' solution at 37 degrees C, demonstrated a passive behaviour for the NiTi alloy. A more pronounced {{difference between the}} corrosion and breakdown potential, i. e. a better resistance to <b>chemical</b> breakdown of <b>passivity</b> was found for the NiTi alloy compared to AISI 316 LVM. X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were undertaken to study the elemental composition {{and structure of the}} surface films prior to, and after immersion in Hanks' solution. The passive film on the NiTi alloy consists of a mainly TiO 2 -based oxide with minimal amounts of nickel in the outermost surface layers. After immersion in Hanks' solution the growth of a calcium-phosphate layer was observed. The passive diffusion of nickel from the NiTi alloy, measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry reduced significantly in time from an initial release rate of 14. 5 x 10 (- 7) mu g cm(- 2) s(- 1) to a nickel release that could not detect anymore after 10 days. It is suggested that the good corrosion properties of the NiTi alloy and the related promising biological response, as reported in literature, may be ascribed to the presence of mainly a TiO 2 -based surface layer and its specific properties, including the formation of a calcium-phosphate layer after exposure to a bioenvironment.
