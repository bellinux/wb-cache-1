5|$|Cooley befriended Captain William Bunce, a {{retailer}} striving to keep Indians in the area, as they represented {{a source of}} <b>cheap</b> <b>labor.</b> He became involved again in local politics, this time against General Jesup, who wanted to remove all Indians from Florida. Judge Steele, a newcomer from Connecticut, was Cooley's ally in this fight.|$|E
5|$|Sugar was {{a luxury}} in Europe until the 18th century, {{when it became}} more widely available. It then became popular and by the 19th century, sugar came to be {{considered}} a necessity. This evolution of taste and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes. It drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing could thrive. The demand for <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> to perform the hard work involved in its cultivation and processing increased the demand for the slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa). After slavery was abolished, there was high demand for indentured laborers from South Asia (in particular India). Millions of slave and indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean and the Americas, Indian Ocean colonies, southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and East Africa and Natal. The modern ethnic mix of many nations that have been settled in the last two centuries has been influenced by the demand for sugar.|$|E

25|$|Economist Branko Milanovic {{argued that}} {{globalization}} {{and the related}} competition with <b>cheaper</b> <b>labor</b> from Asia and immigrants have caused U.S. middle-class wages to stagnate, fueling the rise of populist political candidates such as Donald Trump.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Cheaper</b> <b>labor,</b> {{also called}} the [...] "secondary labor market", {{is used by the}} {{employer}} to undermine the position of more expensive labor through strikebreaking and undercutting. [...] Cheaper laborers are usually unskilled, but can be trained.|$|R

25|$|Chomsky {{believes}} that these austere and neoliberal measures ensure that poorer countries merely fulfill a service role by providing <b>cheap</b> <b>labor,</b> {{raw materials and}} investment opportunities for the developed world. Additionally, this means that corporations can threaten to relocate to poorer countries, and Chomsky sees this as a powerful weapon to keep workers in richer countries in line.|$|E

25|$|High Point was {{an early}} center for the {{development}} of the furniture industry in the South. Functional furniture had been produced on a small scale since the 17th century by artisans of English ancestry who had settled in North Carolina. As the farming landscape of the South began to change with the end of the Civil War and slavery, <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> became available during the Reconstruction Era. The North Carolina furniture industry gained momentum in the late 19th century, and developers were attracted to High Point for its location, transportation, and <b>cheap</b> <b>labor.</b> The city was situated ideally in the center of the Piedmont region with access to vast hardwood forests in the central and western parts of the state. High Point, located at the junction of the railroad and a main state road, was an ideal centralized shipping point for the southern market. An agricultural depression of the 1890s drove farm workers from the countryside to developing towns like High Point looking for industrial jobs.|$|E
25|$|After the Chinese Exclusion Act {{was passed}} in 1882, American {{industrialists}} began to look elsewhere for reliable sources of <b>cheap</b> <b>labor.</b> The Japanese government had forbidden emigration since 1868, but in the 1880s it relaxed some of its restrictions. In 1884, the government of Hawaii offered to subsidize the transport of Japanese labourers to its territory, and advertised a set of conditions under which the migrants would be employed on its sugar plantations.|$|E
25|$|Genale {{was created}} in 1924 {{by a group of}} {{settlers}} from the Italian city of Torino, with the supervision of the Italian governor of the colony. Near the Genale of the colonists and separated by the Shebelle river, soon grew a bigger city populated by Somalis (working as <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> force in the plantations): the actual Janaale. After WW2 remained only Janaale, while Genale disappeared when the defeated Italians moved away from Somalia.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{entrepreneurs}} in LaGrange {{built the first}} cotton mill, and others were rapidly established in this area. Initially they employed only white workers.

50|$|The severe steel {{crisis of}} the late 1970s and early 1980s hit Copperweld hard. The venerable Glassport {{facility}} would close entirely in 1983. In 1986, the Oswego fine wire division was shut down. Both operations were relocated to Copperweld Southern in Fayetteville, largely due to <b>cheaper</b> <b>labor</b> costs in the South.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the main}} themes of the play is the effect social change has on people. The {{emancipation}} of the serfs on 19 February 1861 by Alexander II allowed former serfs to gain wealth and status while some aristocrats were becoming impoverished, unable to tend their estates without the <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> of slavery. The effect of these reforms was still being felt when Chekhov was writing forty years after the mass emancipation.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Ryan {{was elected}} International {{president}} in 1927. During the Great Depression, masses of unemployed workers flooded {{the market with}} <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> and company unions flourished. Then, encouraged by passage of New Deal legislation limiting the use of injunctions to prevent strikes and picketing (the Norris – La Guardia Act) and guaranteeing the rights of workers to vote for their own representation (Wagner Act of 1935), the union immediately began reorganizing and reclaiming lost ports.|$|E
25|$|The main {{causes of}} human {{trafficking}} in Southeast Asia are universal {{factors such as}} poverty and globalization. According to Betz, poverty is not the root of human trafficking {{and that there are}} other factors such as the desire to have access to upward mobility and knowledge on the wealth that can be gained from working in urban cities, that ultimately attracts impoverished individuals to human traffickers. Betz claims the industrialization of the region in the mid 20th century led to a clear division between growing economies and stagnant ones. This industrialization of booming economies, like that of Thailand and Singapore created a draw for poor migrants seeking upward mobility and individuals wanting to leave war torn countries. These migrants were an untapped resource in growing economies that had already exhausted the <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> from within its borders. A high supply of migrant workers seeking employment and high demand from an economy seeking <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> creates a perfect combination for human traffickers to thrive. Still in the new millennium the market for forced labor is profitable; class-divisions and the economies' need for unskilled labor keep traffickers in the market.|$|E
50|$|Relations between Irish and Italian-American laborers at Mamaroneck had {{generally}} been hostile, {{as would be}} seen {{elsewhere in the country}} during the late 19th century, as Irish laborers objected to management importing <b>cheaper</b> <b>labor</b> in the form of recently arrived Italian immigrants. This feeling of animosity would result several minor altercations two weeks prior to the incident.|$|R

25|$|Immigrant monks {{soon began}} {{teaching}} to western audiences, as well. The first Buddhists {{to arrive in}} the United States were Chinese. Hired as <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> for the railroads and other expanding industries, they established temples in their settlements along the rail lines. At about the same time, immigrants from Japan began to arrive as laborers on Hawaiian plantations and central-California farms. In 1899, they established the Buddhist Missions of North America, later renamed the Buddhist Churches of America.|$|E
25|$|Reunification {{would give}} access to <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> and {{abundant}} natural {{resources in the}} North, which, combined with existing technology and capital in the South, would create large economic and military growth potential. According to a 2009 study by Goldman Sachs, a unified Korea could have an economy larger than that of Japan by 2050. A unified Korean military would have {{the largest number of}} reservists as well as one of the largest numbers of military hackers.|$|E
25|$|Four years later, {{when the}} Giants moved to San Francisco {{and left the}} Polo Grounds vacant, J. G. Taylor Spink, {{publisher}} of The Sporting News, made another attempt to find {{the source of the}} term.

GM makes this announcement even though the company is achieving record profits.|$|R
25|$|The {{implementation}} of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 resulted in {{the expansion of the}} maquiladora industry and created new opportunities for employment for women outside of the home and in the factories. The availability of <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> was attractive for business owners to open factories in Mexico and the availability of employment attracted many, especially women, to border towns such as Ciudad Juárez. Research has shown correlations between economic and political issues and violence against women along the border.|$|E
25|$|Some European {{countries}} {{produce a}} significant fraction of their electricity needs from wood or wood wastes. In Scandinavian countries {{the costs of}} manual labor to process firewood is very high. Therefore, {{it is common to}} import firewood from countries with <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> and natural resources. The main exporters to Scandinavia are the Baltic countries (Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia). In Finland, there is a growing interest in using wood waste as fuel for home and industrial heating, in the form of compacted pellets.|$|E
25|$|The first {{members of}} the Issei did not emigrate {{directly}} to the mainland United States, but to Hawaii (when it was American-controlled but not yet one of the United States). These emigrants—the first of whom arrived on board the steamship City of Tokio in February 1885—were common laborers escaping hard times in Japan to work in Hawai'i. Their immigration was subsidized by the Hawaiian government, as <b>cheap</b> <b>labor</b> was needed for important commodity crops, especially its sugar plantations. Numerous Japanese eventually settled in Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, {{profits from}} the textile {{industry}} in New England mill towns such as Lewiston, Biddeford, Manchester, New Hampshire, Waterbury, Connecticut, and Fall River, Haverhill, Lawrence and Lowell, Massachusetts began to decline. Businesses began moving to the South due to lower costs of power from more modern technologies (Lewiston's water wheel technology gave way to hydroelectricity, cheaper transportation (as most cotton and materials came from the South), and <b>cheaper</b> <b>labor).</b>|$|R
30|$|Although, {{there has}} been {{manufacturing}} movement from Korea to China, and China to less developed countries because of the increasing manufacturing cost, there is still an opportunity within each country for the lowering of labor costs. For example, China has a vast territory; there exist provinces that have low labor costs. If China uses its <b>cheaper</b> <b>labor</b> instead of depending on less developed countries, China could be a competitive power for a long time.|$|R
30|$|If, for example, {{gender or}} {{ethnicity}} were {{a signal of}} labor costs, higher callback rates may be resulting from an employers’ perception of <b>cheaper</b> <b>labor</b> costs for minority workers.

Although it appears unlikely that such a mechanism is present, we cannot rule out that it is the case.|$|R
