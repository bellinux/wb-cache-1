25|$|Because {{cardiac output}} {{is related to}} the {{quantity}} of blood delivered to various parts of the body, it can be used as an important indicator of how efficiently the heart <b>can</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> body's demands for perfusion. For instance, exercise requires a higher level of CO to support increased muscle activity. In heart failure, CO may be insufficient to even support simple activities of daily living and cannot increase sufficiently to match the higher metabolic demands stemming from even moderate exercise.|$|E

25|$|To {{connect the}} tunnel to Penn Station, {{extensive}} track modifications will be required. The profile of several tracks {{will have to}} be lowered so that they <b>can</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> grade of the new tunnel tracks at the new portal within A Yard. The I Ladder track, which runs diagonal to the other tracks to provide connections to the platforms tracks, would be extended to connect to the new tracks from the tunnel, allowing trains to stop on Tracks 1 through 18. Some tracks within A Yard would be reconfigured. While construction takes place in A Yard, the three trains stored in A Yard and D Yard would be stored in other locations due to the unavailability of storage tracks in those yards. The Empire Line tunnel, near Tenth Avenue, will be modified–100 feet of that tunnel beneath Tenth Avenue will be lowered so that they can connect to the lower track profile in A Yard. This work will either be constructed during weekends over a 20-month period, or through a full closure of the Empire Line tunnel for two to three months. All of this work would take 21 months.|$|E

At the prison, he is living luxuriously, having his own personal [...] "butler", Herman, as well as other inmates who act as his fan club and protection from other inmates. Looking on at the attention Slattery receives in the cafeteria is Justin Hammer, who wonders what makes him so special. Slattery has been talking with a documentary filmmaker, Jackson Norriss, to chronicle the events of the Mandarin situation seen in Iron Man 3. Norriss, trying to learn more about Slattery personally, recounts his past from his first casting as a child as well as starring in a failed CBS pilot. Norriss eventually informs Slattery that his portrayal has angered some people, including the actual Ten Rings terrorist group, which Slattery did not know existed. Norriss tells him the history of the Mandarin and the terrorist group, before revealing that he is actually a member of the group. The real reason for Norriss interviewing Slattery is to break him out of prison so he <b>can</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> actual Mandarin. Hearing this, Slattery still has no idea of the full ramifications of his posing as the Mandarin.|$|E
500|$|Although no {{maximum length}} for an HDMI cable is specified, signal {{attenuation}} (dependent on the cable's construction quality and conducting materials) limits usable lengths {{in practice and}} certification is difficult to achieve for lengths beyond 13m. HDMI 1.3 defines two cable categories: Category 1-certified cables, which have been tested at 74.5MHz (which would include resolutions such as 720p60 and 1080i60), and Category 2-certified cables, which have been tested at 340MHz (which would include resolutions such as 1080p60 and 2160p30). Category 1 HDMI cables are marketed as [...] "Standard" [...] and Category 2 HDMI cables as [...] "High Speed". This labeling guideline for HDMI cables went into effect on October 17, 2008.
