50|$|Managerial {{epidemiology}} {{differs from}} clinical epidemiology {{in that it}} addresses the concerns of management. For example, <b>clinical</b> <b>epidemiologists</b> who seek to control hospital-acquired infections would not be engaged in managerial epidemiology unless they described the infections as quality indicators and proposed or tested organizational changes that might reduce infection rates. Another distinction between clinical epidemiology and managerial epidemiology is that while <b>clinical</b> <b>epidemiologists</b> test the efficacy of particular treatments, managers are concerned with how clinical outcomes differ between hospitals, bed sections, clinics, or programs. Information of this kind can lead to reallocation of resources so as to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the organization as a whole.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Research methods {{from social}} science, {{such as social}} network analysis, random {{coefficient}} modeling, and advanced measurement techniques, can contribute much to the health sciences. There is, however, a slow rate of transmission of social science methodology into the health sciences. This paper identifies some of the barriers for adoption and proposes ideas for the future. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Commentary. RESULTS: Contributions of social science to the health sciences are not always recognized as such. It may help if the professional profile of social science in the health sciences would be higher and if its focus would be more on making useful predictions. <b>Clinical</b> <b>epidemiologists</b> may assume that their discipline includes all relevant methods and that social science is largely based on qualitative research. These perceptions need to be challenged in order to widen the scope of clinical epidemiology and include relevant methods from other sciences. CONCLUSION: New methods help to ask new research questions and to provide better to old questions.

In conference, the group was asked to identify items they thought should be included in a checklist of standards. Whenever possible, checklist items were guided by research evidence suggesting that failure to adhere to the item proposed could lead to biased results. A modified Delphi technique was used in assessing candidate items. Findings The conference resulted in the QUOROM statement, a checklist, and a flow diagram. The checklist describes our preferred way to present the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of a report of a meta-analysis. It is organised into 21 headings and subheadings regarding searches, selection, validity assessment, data abstraction, study characteristics, and quantitative data synthesis, and in the results with “trial flow”, study characteristics, and quantitative data synthesis; research documentation was identified for eight of the 18 items. The flow diagram provides information about both the numbers of RCTs identified, included, and excluded and the reasons for exclusion of trials.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{this paper}} we propose {{the use of the}} within-subject {{coefficient}} of variation as an index of a measurement's reliability. For continuous variables and based on its maximum likelihood estimation we derive a variance-stabilizing transformation and discuss confidence interval construction within the framework of a one-way random effects model. We investigate sample size requirements for the within-subject coefficient of variation for continuous and binary variables. Methods We investigate the validity of the approximate normal confidence interval by Monte Carlo simulations. In designing a reliability study, a crucial issue is the balance between the number of subjects to be recruited and the number of repeated measurements per subject. We discuss efficiency of estimation and cost considerations for the optimal allocation of the sample resources. The approach is illustrated by an example on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We also discuss the issue of sample size estimation for dichotomous responses with two examples. Results For the continuous variable we found that the variance stabilizing transformation improves the asymptotic coverage probabilities on the within-subject coefficient of variation for the continuous variable. The maximum like estimation and sample size estimation based on pre-specified width of confidence interval are novel contribution to the literature for the binary variable. Conclusion Using the sample size formulas, we hope to help <b>clinical</b> <b>epidemiologists</b> and practicing statisticians to efficiently design reliability studies using the within-subject coefficient of variation, whether the variable of interest is continuous or binary. </p...|$|R
40|$|Life is {{too short}} for a {{conscientious}} physician] to acquire—even with the most suitable education, unremitting observation, accurate investigation, and unwearied reading — [...] . satisfactory confidence in the unreserved treatment of the sick committed to his charge. John Rollo, 1801 (1) Like John Rollo (d. 1809) —an army surgeon trained in Edinburgh 200 years ago—today’s conscientious clinicians wishing to keep up to date with relevant information face a truly daunting task (2). In response to this challenge, <b>clinical</b> <b>epidemiologists</b> at McMaster University, Ontario, Canada, in collaboration with others, initiated (3, 4) and continue to develop (5) the concept of “critical appraisal” of reports of research, encouraging clinicians to be ruthlessly discriminating in their reading.

40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} years key stake holders in the {{healthcare}} sector have increasingly recognised evidence based medicine (EBM) {{as a means to}} improving the quality of healthcare. However, there is considerable uncertainty about the best way to disseminate basic knowledge of EBM. As a result, huge variation in EBM educational provision, setting, duration, intensity, content, and teaching methodology exists across Europe and worldwide. Most courses for health care professionals are delivered outside the work context ('stand alone') and lack adaptation to the specific needs for EBM at the learners' workplace. Courses with modern 'adaptive' EBM teaching that employ principles of effective continuing education might fill that gap. We aimed to develop a course for post-graduate education which is clinically integrated and allows maximum flexibility for teachers and learners. Methods A group of experienced EBM teachers, <b>clinical</b> <b>epidemiologists,</b> clinicians and educationalists from institutions from eight European countries participated. We used an established methodology of curriculum development to design a clinically integrated EBM course with substantial components of e-learning. An independent European steering committee provided input into the process. Results We defined explicit learning objectives about knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour for the five steps of EBM. A handbook guides facilitator and learner through five modules with clinical and e-learning components. Focussed activities and targeted assignments round off the learning process, after which each module is formally assessed. Conclusion The course is learner-centred, problem-based, integrated with activities in the workplace and flexible. When successfully implemented, the course is designed to provide just-in-time learning through on-the-job-training, with the potential for teaching and learning to directly impact on practice. </p...|$|R
