On marrying the heiress of the dukes of Norfolk, the first Howard duke of Norfolk quartered his arms {{with those of}} Thomas of Brotherton 1st Earl of Norfolk, son of King Edward I Longshanks. Starting with the 2nd Duke of Norfolk, the Howards added in the 2nd and 4th quarter the gold lion on red of the Fitzalan Earls of Arundel and the <b>checkered</b> <b>blue</b> and gold of the Warren Earls of Surrey, whom they became heirs of.|$|E
50|$|For Kindergarten, {{the uniform}} is blue {{checkered}} shorts or skirts, yellow shirts, white socks, and formal shoes. In Primary and Middle School, boys wear black pants, and skirts for girls are also <b>checkered</b> <b>blue,</b> but {{the color of}} the shirts are blue and comes both in short or long sleeves. In High School, boys wear black pants and light blue shirt with grey collar, while girls still wear the blue checkered skirts but with a matching blue long-sleeves blouses. Sports uniform for all students consists of dark blue tracksuit pants and sneakers and blue sports shirts. House Color shirts comes in four colors: red, yellow, green, and blue and can be worn with their P.E. tracksuit pants, or school pants for boys and school skirts for girls.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{entitled}} Population Status <b>checkered</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly Phengaris nausithous (Bergsträsser, 1779) on selected meadows in Broumov area was to find and evaluate the situation regarding the size and structure of populations of the butterfly Phengaris nausithous, on a recently selected location within {{the territory of the}} Czech Republic. A used monitoring method was a Capture-Recapture method at 13 locations in the PLA Broumovsko, where the occurrence of the food plant Sanguisorba officinalis, which {{is an integral part of}} the species evolution, was the key for choosing the location. The ant of the genus Myrmica is also important for the evolution of the P. nausithous. The results were evaluated using the program MARK and Statistika and then transferred into graphs and tables. In 2016 it was marked 687 of the P. nausithous and the sum for the overall metapopulation totaled 1, 487 individuals. Most of the P. nausithous occurence with the number of (fixed catches) 149 was registered at the Hynčice 2 (H 2) area, which was the third largest area of all studied habitats. The least number of 15 of the P. nausithous has been marked at the Hynčice 1 (H 1) area. Maximum estimates of numbersfor patches were determined with the program MARK with the highest number of 367 individuals in the H 2 area, whereas the lowest number of 38 individuals at the H 1 area. The numbers of P. nausithous determined by the application MARK were significantly higher than those of fixed catches, indicating good aplication of methodology. It was captured a total of 49 migrations. Overall 31 % of individuals migrated and 18 % of individuals migrated within assumed total number. Most flyovers were between the areas H 2 and H 4 (11 flyovers) and between areas V 1 and H 4 was recorded flyover at a distance of 5. 3 km, which can be considered as one of the longest flyovers. The average distance of migration of P. nausithous was 1. 46 km. The number of immigrants for solid flyovers was set to 49 individuals and the number of immigrants to 58 individuals. The hypothesis of this work was: All the examined areas communicates using flyovers of butterflies and the system can be considered as a single metapopulation and was confirmed given on the basis of the results. Target species dependence on the density of host plant vegetation was not crucial according to the graphic representation. The first T-test found that there is no association between P. nausithous abundance and between the length of the migration between particular areas. The second T-test found that with increasing number of flyovers the length of those flyovers gradually decreased...|$|E

5000|$|In 1957, Smith & Wesson {{offered a}} [...] "no frills" [...] {{version of the}} Model 41 {{designated}} the model 46. In 1959 it was selected by the U.S. Air Force for basic marksmanship training. About 4000 units were made in total: 2500 with a 7-inch barrel, 1000 with 5 inch barrels and 500 5 1/2 inch barrels. The pistol lacked the <b>checkering,</b> polished <b>blue</b> finish, and other refinements of the Model 41. It {{proved to be a}} commercial failure with consumers who preferred the more costly Model 41 and production ceased in 1966, according to firearm historian Sam Fadala.|$|R
50|$|In 1992, the Caracas {{government}} {{tried to}} persuade taxi owners to buy new, safer and more environmentally friendly cars by giving special credit incentives and offering a standardized taxi car. The first taxi fleet to be offer was the Fiat Premio in white with a yellow, black and <b>blue</b> <b>checker</b> sticker that would cover 1/3 of the doors in the middle. Those units were a complete failure because taxi drivers in the country were accustomed to drive heavy duty American cars from the 70's and early 80's like the Chevrolet Malibu, Dodge Dart and Ford Maverick, destroying most of the units {{in just a couple}} of years.|$|R

Nobody had ever really thought about them--that is to say, nobody on Plutoria Avenue. Sometimes one saw a picture in the paper and wondered for a moment who the person was; but on looking more closely and noticing what was written under it, one said, [...] "Oh, I see, an alderman," [...] and turned to something else.|$|R

A <b>blue</b> table is located in the centre of the work and supports a cat, a crawling baby, and a loaf of challah bread on a plate. In addition, a man leans on the left-side of the table, while a woman looking down towards the challah loaf (as if in prayer) sits in a chair on the right side. A number of figures are undertaking various activities throughout the room including a lady wearing a spotted bikini lying on the floor, a collared dog, {{a man and a woman}} kissing, a tall bearded man reaching towards the ceiling, and a mime in a striped shirt. All of the figures are drawn in shades of black and white with the exception of a woman and her baby appearing on a television located on the kitchen counter. The artist's signature ("SeRoTa") appears in black in the upper left section of the painting...|$|R
