40|$|An indepth {{environmental}} {{investigation was}} conducted at a four-story building officing 1200 employees in Oklahoma. A preassessment and walkthrough of the facility revealed extensive ongoing renovations throughout the building. Renovations consisted of installations of new partitions, carpeting, ceiling tiles, and repainting. Management was receiving numerous complaints related to the indoor air quality {{from all parts of}} the building, particularly the unrenovated areas. The majority of employee complaints originated from the unrenovated second floor; in contrast, few complaints had been submitted from the finished fourth floor area. Due to the disparity in employee complaints from these two floors, the investigation focused on a comparison of the air quality on the second and fourth floors. The initial walkthrough revealed inordinate amounts of dust in the occupied space of the second floor. High humidity levels were measured throughout the building. Other potential problems [...] i. e., poor lighting, job stress, poor air circulation, stuffy air, thermal discomfort. smokers in the area [...] were also noted at this point. Questionnaires were made available to occupants on both floors to attain a better understanding of employee problems and assist in formulating an investigation plan. Collectively the nonspecificity of the responses tended to indicate building-related problems often described by the term ''Sick Building Syndrome" (SBS). Based on the questionnaire responses, the walkthrough observations, and the lack of specific illnesses, the investigation focused on identification of and testing for sources of <b>chemical</b> <b>and</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> and possible inadequacies of the mechanical ventilation system in providing the necessary amount of outside air. Although the building investigation revealed few signs of biological contamination, problems of this nature are not uncommon in climates with high humidity. The potential for biological proliferation in buildings with excessive humidity are discussed in the paper. The SBS causation was multifactorial and thus could not be attributed to a single etiologic factor. Temperature and humidity problems were partially attributed to the inadequate provision of chilled water (at a low enough temperature) to ensure proper tempering and dehumidification of the supply air. These periodic excursions in temperature and relative humidity were compounded by an associated reduction in outside air which exacerbated the situation. Other recommendations had to do with improving the filtration system, balancing of the air handling system, improving the ventilation efficiency, separation of smokers and nonsmokers, and the infusion of a fastidious cleaning and maintenance program combined with an adequate supply of fresh air per ASHRAE 62 - 89 specifications...|$|E

40|$|Air staging {{strategy}} is a proven technology to provide efficient biomass combustion with less gaseous <b>and</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions.</b> In this study, two different secondary air distribution modules are employed at two different axial positions {{from the bed}} surface in a 15 kW fixed-bed laboratory scale combustion system includes grate and underfeed bed stocker.

Secondary air inlet module with uniform distribution of air results in 50 % CO reduction by shifting the combustion to a more fuel lean environment and high temperature in the post-combustion zone. Remarkable decrease in particulate matters smaller than 1 Î¼m is achievable through adjusting a uniform secondary air module in an appropriate distance from the bed.

40|$|Abstract: The {{automotive}} industry is currently {{gearing up for}} strict emission regulations worldwide. One {{of the biggest challenges}} facing the {{automotive industry}} is to improve performance and fuel economy at the same time meet ever more stringent legislation exhaust emissions. The trasport sector is one of contributors to both issues and in particular NOx <b>and</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> together with CO 2 emissions from vehicles. To achive this objective it is essential to reduce the weight of each vehicle component and thus of the unit as a whole. The greatest diesel engine problem are NOx <b>and</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions.</b> One of the ways for reducing exhaust emissions is to increase the cylinder peak-fire pressures. In order to meet these objective a new stronger materials for crankcase are needed. One of the best durability materials that supports modern HSDI engines without increasing the sise or weight is compacted graphite iron (CGI). The paper gives a review of compacted graphite iron characteristics in comparison with cast iron with flake graphite and Al-alloy, which are used for cylinder blocks. Also, it gives a review of the new Al and Mg-alloys as well as and plastics...|$|R

40|$|Biodiesel is an {{alternative}} fuel for internal combustion engines. It can reduce carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC) <b>and</b> <b>particulate</b> matter (PM) <b>emissions,</b> compared with diesel fuel, {{but there is also}} an increase in nitrogen oxides (NO x) emission. This study is aimed to compare the effect of applying a biodiesel with either 10 % blended methanol or 10 % fumigation methanol. The biodiesel used in this study was converted from waste cooking oil. Experiments were performed on a 4 -cylinder naturally aspirated direct injection diesel engine operating at a constant speed of 1800 rev/min with five different engine loads. The results indicate a reduction of CO 2, NO x, <b>and</b> <b>particulate</b> mass <b>emissions</b> <b>and</b> a reduction in mean particle diameter, in both cases, compared with diesel fuel. It is of interest to compare the two modes of fueling with methanol in combination with biodiesel. For the blended mode, there is a slightly higher brake thermal efficiency at low engine load while the fumigation mode gives slightly higher brake thermal efficiency at medium and high engine loads. In the fumigation mode, an extra fuel injection control system is required, and there is also an increase in CO, HC and NO 2 (nitrogen dioxide) <b>and</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> in the engine exhaust, which are disadvantages compared with the blended mode.

40|$|Changes in vehicle {{emission}} reduction technologies significantly affect traffic-related emissions in urban areas.

To understand {{the health effects of}} traffic-related emissions, both primary (direct) <b>particulate</b> <b>emission</b> <b>and</b> secondary particle formation (from gaseous precursors in the exhaust emissions) need to be characterized.

40|$|The combustion, gaseous <b>and</b> <b>particulate</b> <b>emissions</b> of {{a diesel}} engine fueled with biodiesel-pentanol (BP) blends were {{investigated}} under different engine loads. The {{results indicate that}} with the increased pentanol fraction, the start of combustion is delayed. All of the BP blends provide faster combustion than biodiesel and diesel fuel from CA 10 to CA 90. The faster combustion of BP blends leads to a higher BTE than that of biodiesel and diesel fuel in most cases. The particle mass and number concentrations are reduced {{by the addition of}} pentanol in biodiesel in most test conditions, due to the higher oxygen concentration for the fuel/air stoichiometry, longer ignition delay for fuel/air mixing, and lower viscosity for the improvement of atomization. The R-(C=O) O-Râ² group in biodiesel is less efficient in suppressing the soot precursor's formation than the R-OH group in pentanol. The diameter of the primary particles is reduced with the increased addition of pentanol.
