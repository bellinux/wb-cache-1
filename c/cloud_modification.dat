40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} that combines individual ground based ultraviolet (UV) measurements from the Austrian UVB monitoring network and area-wide {{data of the}} distribution of clouds derived from satellite images to generate a UV-Index map all over the region. The Austrian UVB Monitoring network provides near real time ground based measurements of surface UV irradiance from fifteen selected locations throughout and in the vicinity of Austria. The amount of ultraviolet radiation passing through the atmosphere as measured by the UVB detectors is indicated in units of the UV-Index, the internationally agreed unit for erythemally weighted solar UV irradiance. Together with clear sky model calculations the measured UV-Index is used to determine the <b>cloud</b> <b>modification</b> factor (CMF), a scaling factor giving the reduction of radiation due to the presence of clouds. Moreover satellite images from MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) with a time resolution of 15 min and a spatial resolution of 0. 05 &deg; are received. From the satellite images the CMFs for the area of Austria are obtained using an algorithm provided by Jean Verdebout.

There are clearly significant uncertainties associated with SRM, and even small-scale experiments that might reduce uncertainty would carry some risk. However, there are also natural and anthropogenic analogs to SRM, such as volcanic eruptions in the case of stratospheric aerosol injection and ship tracks in the case of marine <b>cloud</b> albedo <b>modification.</b> It is essential to understand what we can learn from these analogs in order to validate models, particularly because of the problematic nature of outdoor experiments.

The method uses the modeled UV-radiation under clear-sky conditions, <b>cloud</b> <b>modification</b> factors and a correction factor as input variables. To identify the influence of temporal resolution of input data and modification factors, an ensemble of four different modelling approaches has been calculated, each with hourly or daily resolution. This is especially important because we found no other study describing the influence of the temporal resolution of input data on model performance. Following the results of the statistical analysis of the evaluation period the model with the highest temporal resolution has been chosen for the reconstruction of the UV-radiation doses. This model (HMC) uses modelled UV-radiation under clear sky conditions, a <b>cloud</b> <b>modification</b> factor, both with hourly resolution, and a monthly correction factor.

Km in the Pune region,India, during the 11 -summer monsoon (June-September) seasons (1973 - 74, 1976, 1979 - 86). A double-area cross-over design with area randomization was adopted and an instrumented aircraft was used for seeding and cloud physical measurements. Finely pulverised salt (sodium chloride) particles were released into the monsoon clouds (cumulus and stratocumulus) during aircraft penetrations into the clouds at a height of 200 - 300 m above the cloud-base. The warm cloud responses to salt seeding are found to be critically dependent on the cloud physical characteristics e. g., vertical thickness and liquid water content. Clouds with vertical thickness greater than 1 km, LWC greater than 0. 5 gm/cubic m when seeded with salt particles (modal diameter 10 micro m, concentration 1 per litre of cloud air) produced increase in rainfall of 24 per cent significant at 4 per cent level. Shallow clouds (vertical thickness less than 1 km, LWC less than 0. 5 gm/cubic m) when seeded showed tendency for dissipation.

The case studies demonstrate that polluted mixed-phase clouds have narrower droplet size distributions and contain 1 – 2 orders of magnitude fewer precipitating ice particles than clean clouds at the same temperature. This suggests an aerosol indirect effect leading to greater cloud lifetime, greater cloud emissivity, and reduced precipitation.
