The crude product was recrystallized twice from toluene and then used for further reaction. A typical synthesis procedure of CdSe NCs is given briefly below. Se powder (0.0039 g, 0.05 mmol) and <b>cadmium</b> <b>stearate</b> (0.0679 g, 0.1 mmol) were added into a three-neck flask with 8 mL paraffin liquid.

40|$|Characterization of {{molecular}} scale electronic devices generally involves deposition of a metal top electrode onto an organic film. During the evaporation process, high-energy granules of metals {{may lead to}} unwanted reactions between the organic molecules and deposited top electrodes. This can cause, as commonly reported, lasting damage which leaves most junctions either shorted or an open circuit. To overcome this important issue of physical damage to the molecules, we developed a novel technique of interfacing molecules by laying a prefabricated metallic electrode {{on top of a}} monolayer of molecules which were deposited onto another set of electrodes. A monolayer of <b>cadmium</b> <b>stearate</b> ((C 17 H 35 COO) 2 Cd) was deposited, using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique, onto platinum (Pt) electrodes which further rested on 200 nm of oxide used for isolation. A separate set of aluminum with native oxide (Al/AlOx) electrodes were fabricated on a different oxide free, highly p-doped substrate and was gently placed on the <b>cadmium</b> <b>stearate</b> monolayer. Electrical connection to the top electrode was accomplished by probing the backside of the highly doped wafer whereas the bottom electrodes were individually addressed. Pressure was applied to ensure firm contact between the molecules and the top electrodes. Preliminary results showed an observed switching voltage of 3 V- 4 V. Most of the devices with Al as the top electrodes exhibited a gradual progression from switching on the positive side, closing or no longer switching, and then switching towards the negative side...|$|E
30|$|In this approach, Strouse and his {{collaborators}} emphasized the “specific microwave effect” which will selectively heat certain compounds in the system due to the different polarization of different components. To benefit from the effect, the reactive precursors have to be strong microwave absorbers and the solvent should have no or weak absorption to the microwave. In that case, the polarizable reacting precursor will selectively absorb most of the microwave energy to overcome activation barriers and start the nucleation. Inspection of the cadmium source proved the trend: only the polarizable starting precursors, <b>cadmium</b> <b>stearate</b> (CdSA), CdO, and CdNO 3 produced nanocrystals while ionic CdCl 2 had no nanocrystal produced.|$|E

40|$|In {{analyzing}} {{optical properties}} of multilayered LB films with the uniaxial anisotropy around the surface normal, a new method for calculating infrared reflection-absorbances was developed, by extending Drude's anisotropic calculation theory for two-phase system to Hansen's optical theory for thin isotropic multilayers. With this method, infrared external reflection spectra of a 9 -monolayer LB film of <b>cadmium</b> <b>stearate</b> prepared on a gallium arsenide substrate were analyzed to obtain molecular orientations.

40|$|Variations in the {{structure}} of multilayer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of <b>cadmium</b> <b>stearate</b> with temperature have been monitored by grazing incidence synchrotron X-ray diffraction. At room temperature the film structure comprises a centered rectangular unit cell in the plane of the substrate with the hydrocarbon chains normal to the substrate surface. As the temperature increases up to 90 degrees C, the diffraction pattern due to this in-plane structure becomes diffuse and the intensity decreases. Changes in the Q-values of the in-plane spots indicate an anisotropic expansion of the unit cell. At around 100 degrees C the film undergoes a phase transition from a layered three-dimensional crystalline structure to an array of rod structures packed hexagonally. The rods are oriented parallel {{to the surface of the}} film. The core of each rod is 6. 7 Angstrom in diameter and appears to be composed of cadmium cations and the carboxylate groups of the fatty acid chains.

40|$|Surface {{recovery}} of germanium substrate for infrared spectroscopic studies of Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films {{has been investigated}} by infrared multiple-angle incidence resolution spectroscopy (MAIRS). A Ge substrate is,in general, repeatedly used for fabrication of LB films for infrared spectroscopic studies.

This cleaning generally works well for ordinary analytical use, especially for thick samples, such as polymer and liquid materials.

UV/Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopies have also provided information about the time evolution of the average diameter (D) of the nanocrystals. By employing all these techniques, we have obtained the D(t) data and fitted then to various growth models. Although certain qualitative observations suggest growth of the nanocrystals to be controlled by diffusion-limited Ostwald ripening, we have found it is necessary to include the surface reaction term in the growth equation. Thus, the growth of CdSe and CdS nanocrystals has contributions from both diffusion and surface reaction, with a $D^ 3 -D^ 2 $ type behavior, independent of the capping agent...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{fabrication}} of thin films of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals is attracting much attention {{due to their}} exceptional optoelectronic properties.

Here, we report the use of the pulse injection method to deposit CdSe nanocrystals under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) on clean and well-ordered surfaces.

Furthermore, the XPS analysis has revealed that the surface of theCdSe nanocrystal isCd rich,which has important consequences for the optical and chemical properties.

40|$|Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) of <b>cadmium</b> <b>stearate</b> (CdSt) and cobalt stearate (CoSt) Langmuir-Blodgett films show {{differences in}} their in-plane morphologies. CdSt films, with {{a huge number of}} in-plane “pinhole” defects, follow self-affine behavior, whereas CoSt films, which are almost void of such in-plane defects, show deviation from self-affinity especially at small length scales, suggesting liquidlike behavior, imparting flexibility to the system, in plane. Phase images of CoSt obtained from tapping mode AFM show gentle undulations or hemispherelike features in contrast to its smooth topography, unlike the CdSt system where both height and phase images show self-affine domains. Near edge x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy indicates no preferred in-plane orientation of the head group in CoSt films. The undulating features in CoSt is explained by invoking a radially symmetric orientational distribution in the tilt of adjacent hydrocarbon tails, causing a small in-plane density variation which shows up in the phase image. These orientational disorders in adjacent tails probably allow “filling up” of in-plane defects thereby giving rise to its excellent in-plane coverage and hence a “liquidlike” behavior in CoSt. Brewster angle microscopy shows that parent Langmuir monolayers of stearic acid in the presence of Cd and Co ions in the aqueous subphase behave as two-dimensional “solids” and “liquids,” respectively, suggesting the phenomena to be inherent in the amphiphiles and probably independent of their organization as monolayers and multilayers...|$|E
40|$|A Langmuir−Blodgett {{multilayer}} film of cadmium arachidate and a complex multilayer system of <b>cadmium</b> <b>stearate</b> bilayers separated by copolymer interlayers {{have been prepared}} by sequential transfer of deuterated and nondeuterated bilayers on a solid support. They were investigated at different temperatures using X-ray and neutron specular as well as diffuse reflectivity measurements. The neutron scattering {{was used to determine}} the vertical arrangement of deuterated chains within the multilayers and to study the different roughnesses at the chain−chain and chain−metal ion interface separately. The specular reflectivity patterns of both samples could only be interpreted considering the contribution of resonant−diffuse scattering caused by the perfect vertical correlation of individual interface roughnesses within a certain domain. For the two samples the superstructure peak intensity appearing in the respective neutron reflectivity curve decreases dramatically during annealing between 50 and 65 °C. This indicates an intermixing of deuterated and nondeuterated molecules within the film. The molecular exchange cannot be suppressed by the incorporation of copolymer interlayers between the deuterated and nondeuterated chains. Because the X-ray reflectivity patterns remain nearly unaffected by the annealing and because the annealing temperature was lower than the melting point of the pure fatty acid phase (about 70 °C), we interpret this effect by a vertical movement of fatty acid molecules across the still lamellarly stacked framework of fatty acid salt molecules. The temperature dependence of this process shows Arrhenius-like behavior. For both samples the estimated activation energy is 1. 7 ± 0. 5 eV (164 ± 48 kJ/mol) and is assigned to the van der Waals bonding energy of single molecules in a 2 D hexagonal lattice.

40|$|In this article, {{we report}} {{the results of}} our {{detailed}} investigations of the growth kinetics of zero-dimensional nanocrystals as well as one-dimensional nanorods by the combined use of small angel X-ray scattering (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) along with other physical techniques. The study includes growth kinetics of gold nanocrystals formed by the reduction of $HAuCl_ 4 $ by tetrakis(hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride in aqueous solution, of CdSe nanocrystals formed by the reaction of <b>cadmium</b> <b>stearate</b> and selenium under solvothermal conditions, and of ZnO nanorods formed by the reaction of zinc acetate with sodium hydroxide under solvothermal conditions in the absence and presence of capping agents. The growth of gold nanocrystals does not follow the diffusion-limited Ostwald ripening, and instead follows a Sigmoidal rate curve. The heat change associated with the growth determined by isothermal titration calorimetry is about $ 10 kcal. mol^{- 1 }$ per 1 nm increase in the diameter of the nanocrystals. In the case of CdSe nanocrystals also, the growth mechanism deviates from diffusion-limited growth and follows a combined model containing both diffusion and surface reaction terms. Our study of the growth kinetics of uncapped and poly(vinyl pyrollidone) (PVP) -capped ZnO nanorods has yielded interesting insights. We observe small nanocrystals next to the ZnO nanorods after a lapse of time in addition to periodic focusing and defocusing of the width of the length distribution. These observations lend support to the diffusion-limited growth model for the growth of uncapped ZnO nanorods. Accordingly, the time ependence on the length of uncapped nanorods follows the $L^ 3 $ law as required for diffusion-limited Ostwald ripening. The PVP-capped nanorods, however, show a time dependence, which is best described by a combination of diffusion $(L^ 3) $ and surface reaction $(L^ 2) $ terms...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{architecture of}} azopolymers may be controlled via chemical synthesis and with {{selection of a}} suitable film-forming method, which is important for improving their properties for practical uses. Here we address the main challenge of combining the photoinduced birefringence features of azopolymers with the higher thermal and mechanical stabilities of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) using Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) to synthesize diblock- and triblock-copolymers of an azomonomer and the monomer methyl methacrylate. Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films made with the copolymers mixed with <b>cadmium</b> <b>stearate</b> displayed essentially the same optically induced birefringence characteristics, in terms of maximum and residual birefringence and time for writing, as the mixed LB films with the homopolymer poly[4 -(N-ethyl-N-(2 -methacryloxyethyl)) amino- 2 `-chloro- 4 `-nitroazobenzene] (HPDR 13), also synthesized via ATRP. In fact, the controlled architecture of HPDR 13 chains led to Langmuir films that could be more closely packed and reach higher collapse pressures than the corresponding films obtained with HPDR 13 -conv synthesized via conventional radicalar polymerization. This allowed LB films to be fabricated from neat HPDR 13, which was not possible with HPDR 13 -conv. The enhanced organization in the LB films produced with controlled azopolymer chains, however, led to a smaller free volume available for isomerization of the azochromophores, thus yielding a lower photoinduced birefringence than in the HPDR 13 -conv films. The combination of ATRP synthesis and LB technology is then promising to obtain optical storage in films with improved thermal and mechanical processabilities, though a further degree of control must be sought to exploit film organization while maintaining the necessary free volume in the films.

40|$|Nesta tese foi explorado o controle de arquitetura {{molecular}} pelo uso das técnicas de Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) e automontagem (LBL) para produzir filmes nanoestruturados de azopolímeros e azocorantes de baixa massa molecular. A primeira contribuição foi a síntese química de azopolímeros, nos quais os grupos azo são ligados covalentemente a uma cadeia polimérica. Para produção de filmes LBL, que requer compostos solúveis em água, fez-se a sulfonação do PAZO (poli(p-azofenileno)) resultando no PAZOS (poli(p-azofenileno sulfonado)). Este azopolímero conjugado apresentou luminescência em solução, confirmando cálculos teóricos, mas não em filmes LBL com poli(alilamina) (PAH). Os filmes LBL são condutores elétricos quando dopados com iodo e têm propriedades de birrefringência opticamente induzida. A fotoindução da birrefringência com laser linearmente polarizado foi muito lenta, com tempos consideravelmente maiores que em outros filmes LBL, devido não só às interações eletrostáticas, mas também à rigidez da cadeia conjugada. Outro polímero sintetizado foi o DR 19 CL-IPDI, que é solúvel em clorofórmio e foi utilizado para fabricação de filmes de Langmuir e LB. Os filmes LB só puderam ser produzidos utilizando a estratégia de co-espalhamento com estearato de cádmio (CdSt). Os experimentos de birrefringência opticamente induzida indicaram que os filmes LB de DR 19 CL-IPDI/CdSt têm maior birrefringência que os outros azopolímeros derivados de poliuretanos, pois o seu máximo de absorbância coincide com o comprimento de onda do laser de escrita. Por outro lado, a birrefringência residual, após desligamento do laser, foi menor que em sistemas similares porque a relaxação do azocromóforo é facilitada devido a este polímero possuir menor temperatura de transição vítrea. Ainda com filmes de Langmuir, utilizamos a espectroscopia de UV-VI in situ para analisar os filmes de HPDR 13 (poli 4 -́ 2 -(metacriloiloxi) etiletilamino - 2 -cloro- 4 -nitroazobenzeno)). Em acordo com as isotermas de pressão de superfície, os resultados indicaram que com maiores temperaturas de subfase, as cadeias de HPDR 13 ganham flexibilidade e são mais bem empacotadas, ocupando menor área por molécula. A importância do controle da arquitetura molecular foi demonstrada no estudo da birrefringência fotoinduzida e formação de grades de relevo de superfície (SRG) nos filmes LBL de azocorantes com quitosana e em filmes do azopolímero PS 119 com dendrímeros DAB (Polipropilenimina). Os filmes LBL de quitosana com o corante SunsetYellow (SY) possuem birrefringência espontânea devida a uma organização molecular proveniente da técnica de automontagem. Para os filmes Ponceau S (PS), a birrefringência pode ser fotoinduzida e a dinâmica depende do pH utilizado na fabricação do filme, devido a alterações nas interações intermoleculares. A estrutura interna do filme LBL de dendrímero DAB teve grande efeito na adsorção de PS 119, que aumentou com a geração, de 1 para 5. A maior adsorção do dendrímero G 5 foi atribuída ao maior número de sítios ionizados para interagir com os azocromóforos do PS 119. Entretanto, a birrefringência fotoinduzida foi maior para os filmes LBL com dendrímeros de menor geração, pois os filmes de geração maior apresentam maior interpenetração entre as camadas. Esta restringe a mobilidade dos cromóforos, gerando menor birrefringência. Esta explicação foi corroborada pela observação de maiores amplitudes das SRG, 31 nm e 5 nm, para filmes de 35 bicamadas de PS 119 /DAB G 1 e PS 119 /DAB G 5, respectivamente. Estas grades foram formadas por transporte de massa causado por efeitos fotônicos, sendo observadas só para luz com polarização p e não sIn {{this thesis}} we exploit {{the control of}} molecular architecture provided by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) and layer-by-layer (LBL) techniques to produce nanostructured films from azobenzene-containing materials, azopolymers and low molecular weight azodyes. The first contribution {{was associated with the}} chemical synthesis of azopolymers, in which azochromophores were attached to polymer chains. For LBL film fabrication, which requires water-soluble materials, the sulfonation of the polymer PAZO (poly(p-azophenylene)) led to PAZOS (sulphonated poly(p-azophenylene)) This conjugated azopolymer was luminescent in solution, confirming theoretical predictions, but not in LBL films when alternated with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH). The latter LBL films displayed electric conductivity when doped with iodine and were also amenable to photoinduced birefringence. The writing of information with a linearly polarized laser was very slow, with writing times considerably longer than for other LBL films due not only to the electrostatic interactions in the film but also to the rigidity of the conjugated chain. The other polymer synthesized and characterized here was DR 19 CL-IPDI, which is soluble in organic solvents and was used to fabricate Langmuir and LB films. The LB films could only be produced by employing the strategy of co-spreading with an amphiphile, in this case DR 19 CL-IPDI mixed with <b>cadmium</b> <b>stearate</b> (CdSt). Experiments with photoinduced birefringence in the LB films of DR 19 CL-IPDI/CdSt indicated higher birefringence than in other polyurethane-based azopolymers because the laser wavelength almost coincides with the wavelength for maximum absorbance. On the other hand, the residual birefringence - after the writing laser was switched off - was smaller than in those similar systems because azochromophore relaxation is facilitated in DR 19 CL-IPDI due to its lower glass transition temperature. Still with regard to Langmuir films, we have introduced the in situ UV-VIS. spectroscopy technique to analyze films of HPDR 13 (poly 4 &# 8217;- 2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethylethylamino - 2 -chloro- 4 -nitroazobenzene). Consistent with the pressure-area isotherms, the results from this spectroscopy indicated that at higher subphase temperatures the HPDR 13 chains gain flexibility and the molecules can be packed in a more condensed manner, leading to a smaller occupied area per molecule. The importance of molecular architecture control was demonstrated in the study of photoinduced birefringence and formation of surface-relief gratings in LBL films consisting of azodyes alternated with chitosan, and the azopolymer PS 119 alternated with DAB (polypropylenimine) dendrimers. In the chitosan LBL films, those containing the azodye Sunset Yellow (SY) exhibited spontaneous birefringence owing to the anisotropy in molecular organization imparted by the LBL technique. For Ponceau S (PS) films, birefringence could be photoinduced with the dynamics of writing depending on the solution pH employed for film fabrication, owing to changes in the intermolecular interactions. The internal structure of LBL films from DAB dendrimers had a large effect on the adsorption of PS 119, which increased with the generation, from 1 to 5. The more effective adsorption for G 5 dendrimer was due to a larger number of ionized sites for interacting with the azochromophores of PS 119. In contrast, the photoinduced birefringence was higher for LBL films of the low generation G 1 dendrimer, which was explained by the stronger interpenetration between adjacent layers in the higher generation dendrimers. In LBL films from PS 119 /DAB G 5, this interpenetration restricts the chromophore mobility, leading to a smaller birefringence. Consistent with this explanation, higher amplitudes were obtained for 35 -bilayer films of PS 119 /DAB G 1 (31 nm) in comparison with films from PS 119 /DAB G 5 (5 nm). These gratings were formed with mass transport arising from a light-driven mechanism, as photoinscription was only successful with p-polarized light and not with s-polarized ligh...|$|E
