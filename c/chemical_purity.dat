2500|$|The {{structural}} role {{of cellulose}} in cell walls has been likened {{to that of}} the glass strands of fiberglass or to the supporting rods within reinforced concrete. Cellulose fibrils are highly insoluble and inelastic and, because of their molecular configuration, have a tensile strength comparable to that of steel. Consequently, cellulose imparts a unique combination of chemical resilience and mechanical support and flexibility to the tissues in which it resides. [...] Bacterial cellulose, produced by Acetobacter species, displays unique properties, including high mechanical strength, high water absorption capacity, high crystallinity, and an ultra-fine and highly pure fiber network structure. One of the most important features of bacterial cellulose is its <b>chemical</b> <b>purity.</b> In addition to this, bacterial cellulose is stable towards chemicals and at high temperatures. Bacterial cellulose has been suggested to have a construction like a ‘cage' which protects the cell from foreign material and heavy-metal ions, while still allowing nutrients to be supplied easily by diffusion. Bacterial cellulose was described by Louis Pasteur as [...] "a sort of moist skin, swollen, gelatinous and slippery." [...] Although the solid portion in the gel is less than one percent, it is almost pure cellulose containing no lignin and other foreign substances. Although bacterial cellulose is obtained {{in the form of a}} highly swollen gel, the texture is quite unique and different from typical gels. [...] Cellulose has a high swollen fiber network resulting from the presence of pore structures and tunnels within the wet pellicle. Plant cellulose water retention values 60%, while bacterial cellulose has a water retention value of 1000%.|$|E

Practical ethics is, after all, a quantitative science. In the reality of life there are few absolute cases, and it is foolish to forego a great end for a small concession. But to suffer so much Royalty and Privilege as an Englishman has to do before he may make any effectual figure in public life is not a small concession. By the time you have purchased power you may find you have given up everything that made power worth having. It would be a small concession, I admit, a mere personal self-sacrifice, to pretend loyalty, kneel and kiss hands, assist at Coronation mummeries, {{and all the rest of}} it, in order, let us say, to accomplish some great improvement in the schools of the country, were it not for the fact that all these things must be done in the sight of the young, that you cannot kneel to the King without presenting a kneeling example to the people, without becoming as good a teacher of servility as though you were servile to the marrow. There lies the trouble. By virtue of this reaction it is that the shams and ceremonies we may fancy mere curious survivals, mere kinks and tortuosities, cloaks and accessories to-day, will, if we are silent and acquiescent, be halfway to reality again in the course of a generation. To our children they are not evidently shams; they are powerful working suggestions. Human institutions are things of life, and whatever weed of falsity lies still rooted in the ground has the promise and potency of growth. It will tend perpetually, according to its nature, to recover its old influence over the imagination, the thoughts, and acts of our children.|$|E

50|$|Dissolving pulp, {{also called}} {{dissolving}} cellulose, is bleached wood pulp or cotton linters {{that has a}} high cellulose content (> 90%).

Dissolving pulp is so named because it is not made into paper, but dissolved either in a solvent or by derivatization into a homogeneous solution, which makes it completely chemically accessible and removes any remaining fibrous structure. Once dissolved, it can be spun into textile fibers (viscose or Lyocell), or chemically reacted to produce derivatized celluloses, such cellulose triacetate, a plastic-like material formed into fibers or films, or cellulose ethers such as methyl cellulose, used as a thickener.|$|E
3000|$|... [25] {{offers a}} {{feasible}} method to produce PET tracers with high SA for neuroimaging through electrophilic fluorination. When using post-target-produced [18 F]F 2, the SA depends on several factors, {{such as the}} initial amount of [18 F]F- {{and the amount of}} carrier fluorine used in the 19 F- 18 F exchange reaction [25]. The SA of [18 F]CFT can potentially be increased by further optimizing this 19 F- 18 F exchange reaction by decreasing the amount of carrier F 2. However, in our hands, this resulted in a dramatic decrease in RCY. The amount of carrier F 2 used in this study (290 to 400 nmol) is a compromise, offering SA and RCY that are high enough for several human PET studies from one production run. The radiochemical and <b>chemical</b> <b>purities</b> of the final product were verified by HPLC, and both were found to fulfill the requirements for human injection (i.e., RCP > 95.0 % and the absence of unknown signals in the UV trace; Figure 3).

Furthermore, even when the desirable signal is present, its concentration might be indistinguishable from its environmental steady-state prediction, thus preventing its conversion to a cooling or heating history. We explore the saturation properties and the thermal activation parameters of various OSL signals in quartz to outline the capabilities and limitations for their use in lowtemperature thermochronometry...|$|R
