25|$|Bittaker and Norris drove Hall to a {{location}} in the San Gabriel Mountains beyond where they had taken Lucinda Schaefer. At this location, she was raped twice by Bittaker and once by Norris. On the second occasion in which Bittaker raped Hall, Norris saw what he believed to be vehicle headlights approaching. Upon informing Bittaker, he (Bittaker) <b>clasped</b> <b>his</b> hand over Hall's mouth and dragged her into nearby bushes as Norris drove in an unsuccessful search of the vehicle he had seen. When {{he returned to the}} van, the pair drove to {{a location}} deeper in the San Gabriel Mountains, where Bittaker forced Hall to walk, naked, up a hill alongside the road, then perform fellatio upon him. Bittaker then ordered Andrea Hall to pose for several Polaroid pictures.|$|E
500|$|At {{about three}} in the morning of 26 June 1830 at Windsor Castle, George awoke and passed a bowel {{movement}} – [...] "a large evacuation mix'd with blood." [...] He then sent for Halford, allegedly calling to his servants [...] "Sir Henry! Sir Henry! Fetch him; this is death!" [...] Accounts of George's final moments and last words vary. According to Halford, following his arrival and that of Sir William Knighton, the King's [...] "lips grew livid, and he dropped his head on the page's shoulder...I was up the stairs in five minutes, and he died but eight minutes afterwards." [...] Other accounts state the King placed his hands on his stomach and said [...] "Surely, this must be death," [...] or that he called out [...] "Good God, what is this?", <b>clasped</b> <b>his</b> page's hand, said [...] "my boy, this is death", and died. George died at 3:15 a.m. An autopsy conducted by his physicians revealed George had died from upper gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from the rupture of a blood vessel in his stomach. A large tumour [...] "the size of an orange" [...] was found attached to his bladder; his heart was enlarged, had heavily calcified valves and was surrounded by a large fat deposit.|$|E
500|$|Physicist Isidor Rabi noticed Oppenheimer's disconcerting triumphalism: [...] "I'll {{never forget}} his walk; I'll {{never forget the}} way {{he stepped out of}} the car... his walk was like High Noon... this kind of strut. He had done it." [...] At an {{assembly}} at Los Alamos on August 6 (the evening of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima), Oppenheimer took to the stage and <b>clasped</b> <b>his</b> hands together [...] "like a prize-winning boxer" [...] while the crowd cheered. He noted his regret the weapon had not been available in time to use against Nazi Germany. However, he and many of the project staff were very upset about the bombing of Nagasaki, as they did not feel the second bomb was necessary from a military point of view. He traveled to Washington on August 17 to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned. In October 1945 Oppenheimer was granted an interview with President Harry S Truman. The meeting, however, went badly, after Oppenheimer remarked he felt he had [...] "blood on my hands". The remark infuriated Truman {{and put an end to}} the meeting. Truman later told his Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson [...] "I don't want to see that son-of-a-bitch in this office ever again." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the first}} Test began, Jardine persisted with Bodyline tactics, even though Bradman, the main target, {{did not play}} in the match. David Frith {{has pointed out that}} Bradman would have been {{watching}} and seeing the tactics that England were using. However, when Stan McCabe was scoring 187 not out, Jardine was briefly seen to be unsettled as runs came quickly, and he may not have been fully convinced that the tactics would be successful. England eventually won the match comfortably. In the second Test, Jardine completely misjudged the pitch and left out a specialist spinner when conditions later in the match favoured one. The match seemed to be going well when Bill Bowes unexpectedly bowled the returning Bradman first ball in the first innings; Jardine was seen to be so delighted that he had <b>clasped</b> <b>his</b> hands above his head and performed a [...] "war dance". This was an extremely unusual reaction in the 1930s, particularly from Jardine who rarely showed any emotion while playing cricket. In the second innings, Bradman scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each. This made it seem to critics that Bodyline was not quite the threat that had been perceived and Bradman's reputation, which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures, was restored. On the other hand, the pitch was slightly slower than was customary throughout the series, and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness.|$|E
500|$|The Celtics were {{ahead by}} nine points with five minutes remaining; in addition, West was heavily limping after a Game 5 thigh injury and Chamberlain {{had left the}} game with an injured leg. West then hit one basket after the other and cut the lead to one, and Chamberlain asked {{to return to the}} game. However, Lakers coach Bill van Breda Kolff kept Chamberlain on the bench {{until the end of the}} game, saying later that he wanted to stay with the lineup {{responsible}} for the comeback. The Celtics held on for a 108–106 victory, and Russell claimed his eleventh championship in 13 years. At age 35, Russell contributed 21 rebounds in his last NBA game. After the game, Russell went over to the distraught West (who had scored 42 points and was named the only NBA Finals MVP in history from the losing team), <b>clasped</b> <b>his</b> hand and tried to soothe him. Days later, 30,000 enthusiastic Celtics fans cheered their returning heroes, but Russell was not there: the man who said he owed the public nothing ended his career and cut all ties to the Celtics. It came as so surprising that even Red Auerbach was blindsided, and as a consequence, he made the [...] "mistake" [...] of drafting guard Jo Jo White instead of a center. Although White became a standout Celtics player, the Celtics lacked an All-Star center, went just 34–48 in the next season and failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 1950. In Boston, both fans and journalists felt betrayed, because Russell left the Celtics without a coach and a center and sold his retirement story for $10,000 to Sports Illustrated. Russell was accused of selling out the future of the franchise for a month of his salary.|$|E

2500|$|Ronaldo {{was at his}} {{physical}} peak at Barcelona, {{and many of his}} 47 goals involved him rounding the goalkeeper before slotting the ball into the net. Probably his most memorable goal was scored at SD Compostela on 11 October 1996. Having received the ball inside his own half, he evaded a cynical tackle of the first opponent with a drag back, before running away from another and ran towards goal where he went past two more defenders in the box with close ball control, and then slotted the ball into the bottom corner of the net. The camera then cut to Barcelona manager Bobby Robson who had got up off the bench and <b>clasped</b> <b>his</b> head in disbelief at what he had seen. The footage of the goal was later used in a Nike advert with a voiceover asking: [...] "Imagine you asked God to be {{the best player in the}} world, and he listened to you". The day after the goal, the headline in the Spanish newspaper AS read: 'Pele returns'. Such was the manner Ronaldo ran through opposing defences, former Real Madrid forward Jorge Valdano commented; [...] "he's not a man, he's a herd". At the end of 1996, aged 20, Ronaldo became the youngest player to win FIFA World Player of the Year.|$|E
