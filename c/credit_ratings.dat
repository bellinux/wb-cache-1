30|$|A {{credit rating}} {{database}} offers assessments regarding borrowers’ creditworthiness, investment risk, and default probability for financial institutions (Chen and Cheng 2013). Akdemir and Karsli (2012) suggested that, while credit rating agencies play a praiseworthy role in Eurozone financial markets, if {{the reputation of}} an agency was suspect, and did not provide correct ratings, it may elevate global financial market crisis. Credit rating agencies provide rating reviews that {{are influenced by the}} informational content of <b>crediting</b> <b>ratings,</b> which possibly extend their economic function in financial markets (Bannier and Hirsch 2010). Due to higher uncertainty and lower institutional quality in emerging markets, rating effects have stronger effects (Erbas 2005). A regulator could provide an incentive to deviate from credit rating agencies and offer inflated ratings, thus, an approval scheme exists to lead to correct ratings (Stolper 2009). There exists a financial system with a perfect credit rating that microfinance institutions were more than willing to expand the frontier of finance by providing loans to high-tech enterprises (Hartarska and Nadolnyak 2008). Property appraisal estimates from external or internal appraisers were different due to information asymmetry; however, external appraiser agencies are better able to provide a reasonable assessment of the fair value of assets (Muller and Riedl 2002).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{economic}} viability and welfare contribution of alternatives to issuer-paid credit rating agencies (CRAs). To this end, it introduces a heterogeneous competition model for <b>credit</b> and <b>ratings</b> markets. Frictions among issuers or investors induce rating inflation from issuer-paid CRAs. Investor-paid CRAs suffer from three sources of free-riding and {{are generally not}} economically viable when competing with issuer-paid CRAs. Only for very limited parameter ranges can investor-paid CRAs thrive and counter rating inflation. Other proposed alternatives such as investor-produced ratings and CRA co-investments employ skin-in-the-game to induce proper screening accuracy. However, as traditional issuer-paid CRAs can cater better to issuers, such alternatives generate little demand or are implemented ineffectively. Hence, this paper provides {{an explanation for the}} evolution, dominance and resiliency of issuer-paid CRAs...|$|R
25|$|The {{subscription}} {{approach was}} the prevailing business model {{until the early}} 1970s, when Moody's, Fitch, and finally Standard & Poor's adopted the issuer-pays model. Several factors contributed to this transition, including increased investor demand for <b>credit</b> <b>ratings,</b> and widespread use of information sharing technology—such as fax machines and photocopiers—which allowed investors to freely share agencies’ reports and undermined demand for subscriptions. Today, eight of the nine nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSRO) use the issuer-pays model, only Egan-Jones maintains an investor subscription service. Smaller, regional credit rating agencies may use either model. For example, China's oldest rating agency, Chengxin Credit Management Co., uses the issuer-pays model. The Universal <b>Credit</b> <b>Ratings</b> Group, formed by Beijing-based Dagong Global Credit Rating, Egan-Jones of the U.S. and Russia’s RusRatings, uses the investor-pays model, while Dagong Europe Credit Rating, the other joint-venture of Dagong Global Credit Rating, uses the issuer-pays model.|$|E
