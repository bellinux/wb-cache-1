25|$|Social psychologists study group-related (<b>collective)</b> <b>phenomena</b> {{such as the}} {{behavior}} of crowds. An important concept {{in this area is}} deindividuation, a reduced state of self-awareness that can be caused by feelings of anonymity. Deindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes dangerous behavior.

2500|$|Perturbation theory also {{fails to}} {{describe}} {{states that are}} not generated adiabatically from the [...] "free model", including bound states and various <b>collective</b> <b>phenomena</b> such as solitons. Imagine, for example, {{that we have a}} system of free (i.e. non-interacting) particles, to which an attractive interaction is introduced. Depending on the form of the interaction, this may create an entirely new set of eigenstates corresponding to groups of particles bound to one another. An example of this phenomenon may be found in conventional superconductivity, in which the phonon-mediated attraction between conduction electrons leads to the formation of correlated electron pairs known as Cooper pairs. When faced with such systems, one usually turns to other approximation schemes, such as the variational method and the WKB approximation. This is because there is no analogue of a bound particle in the unperturbed model and the energy of a soliton typically goes as the inverse of the expansion parameter. However, if we [...] "integrate" [...] over the solitonic phenomena, the nonperturbative corrections in this case will be tiny; of the order of exp(−1/) or exp(−1/2) in the perturbation parameter [...] Perturbation theory can only detect solutions [...] "close" [...] to the unperturbed solution, even if there are other solutions for which the perturbative expansion is not valid.|$|E

Furthermore, group-level UCB had a significant positive association with individual-level UCB. There was no evidence that a greater consistency of citizenship within a unit was associated with a stronger relationship between collective and individual citizenship behaviors. These findings suggest that it is worthwhile to analyze UCB as a <b>collective</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> and the authors call for more work on the contextual antecedents of union citizenship and participation...|$|R

60|$|The {{shape of}} Condorcet's ideas upon history {{arose from the}} twofold {{necessity}} which his character imposed upon him, at once of appeasing his aspirations on behalf of mankind, and of satisfying a disciplined and scientific intelligence. He was of too robust an understanding to find adequate gratification in the artificial construction of hypothetical utopias. Conviction was as indispensable as hope; and distinct grounds for the faith that was in him, as essential as the faith itself. The result of this fact of mental constitution, the intellectual conditions of the time being what they were, was the rise in his mind of the great and central conception of there being a law in the succession of social states, to be ascertained by {{an examination of the}} <b>collective</b> <b>phenomena</b> of past history. The merit of this admirable effort, and of the work in which it found expression, is very easily underrated, because the effort was insufficient and merely preparatory, while modern thought has already carried us far beyond it, and at least into sight of the more complete truths to which this effort only pointed the way. Let us remember, however, that it did point the way distinctly and unmistakably. A very brief survey of the state of history as a subject of systematic study enables us to appreciate with precision what service it was that Condorcet rendered; for it carries us back from the present comparatively advanced condition of the science of society to a time before his memorable attempt, when conceptions now become so familiar were not in existence, and when even the most instructed students of human affairs no more felt the need of a scientific theory of the manner in which social effects follow social causes, than the least instructed portion of the literary public feels such a need in our own time. It is difficult after a subject has been separated from the nebulous mass of unclassified knowledge, after it has taken independent shape, and begun to move in lines of its own, to realise the process by which all this was effected, or the way in which before all this the facts concerned presented themselves to the thinker's mind. That we should overcome the difficulty is one of the conditions of our being able to do justice to the great army of the precursors.|$|E

40|$|Collective {{dynamics}} and force generation by cytoskeletal filaments are crucial in many cellular processes. Investigating growth dynamics of {{a bundle of}} N independent cytoskeletal filaments pushing against a wall, we show that chemical switching (ATP/GTP hydrolysis) leads to a <b>collective</b> <b>phenomenon</b> that is currently unknown. Obtaining force-velocity relations for different models that capture chemical switching, we show, analytically and numerically, that the collective stall force of N filaments is greater than N times the stall force of a single filament. Employing an exactly solvable toy model, we analytically prove the above result for N= 2. We, further, numerically show {{the existence of this}} <b>collective</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> for N>= 2, in realistic models (with random and sequential hydrolysis) that simulate actin and microtubule bundle growth. We make quantitative predictions for the excess forces, and argue that this collective effect is related to the non-equilibrium nature of chemical switching. Comment: New J. Phys., 201...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This rather {{philosophical}} paper {{discusses the}} necessary three ingredients which together allow a <b>collective</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{to be described}} as “emergent”. First the phenomenon, as usual, requires a group of agents entering in a non-linear relationship and entailing the existence of two semantic descriptions depending {{on the scale of}} observation. Second this phenomenon has to be observed by a mechanical observer instead of a human one, which has the natural capacity for temporal and/or spatial integration. Finally, for this natural observer to detect and select the <b>collective</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> it needs to do so in rewards of the adaptive value this phenomenon is responsible for. The presence of natural selection drives us to defend, with many authors, the idea that emergent phenomena can only belong to biology. After a brief philosophical plea, we present a simple and illustrative computer thought experiment in which a society of agents evolves a stigmergic collective behavior as an outcome of its greater adaptive value. The three ingredients are illustrated and discussed within this experimental context. Key words: emergence, natural selection...|$|R

40|$|In social {{sciences}} {{the concept of}} identity was developed very wildly. One can find many ways to approach this phenomenon {{in the field of}} sociological theories. Therefore the following text aims to provide some basic points of orientation which would clarify the field of various sociological concepts of identity. The attention is paid especially to the three schools of thought which I consider to be the most important. It is symbolic interactionism, social constructivism and so-called “postmodern” approach to the concept of identity. As an instrument of orientation, there are two central dimensions of the concept of identity. It is a debate about the static or dynamic nature of identity and dilemma, whether identity should be studied rather as an individual or a <b>collective</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> Static understanding of identity is considered to be outdated by the tendency to understand an identity as dynamic and constructed entity. This way of view was initiated by symbolic interactionism. The other two schools of thought basically followed this way of view. Studying identity as an individual phenomenon is typical for symbolic interactionism. Social constructivism emphasizes inseparability of individual and collective components of identity. “Postmodern” approach sees identity as a problem of contemporary society. Its conclusions tend to accentuate identity as a <b>collective</b> <b>phenomenon...</b>|$|R
