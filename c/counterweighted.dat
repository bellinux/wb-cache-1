5|$|It was {{important}} {{to keep track of}} the amount of ice being loaded onto a ship for both commercial and safety reasons, so ice blocks were each weighed before they went onto a ship, and a total tally of the weight of the ice was recorded. Initially a crude method of loading involving ice tongs and a whip was used to lower the separated blocks of ice into the hold, but an improved method was developed by the 1870s involving a levered platform, superseded by a <b>counterweighted</b> platform device by 1890. Ships were loaded quickly to prevent the ice from melting and, in U.S. ports, an average cargo could be loaded in just two days. Freight charges were paid on the intake, or departure, weight of the cargo, and conditions were laid down on the handling of the ice along the route.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Cadillac V16 {{could be}} said to be two straight-8 engines on a common crankshaft and crankcase, because each bank operated entirely independently of the other with no other shared components. It sported a narrow 45° bank angle for use in the new Cadillac chassis (which became the Fleetwood). The engine was well engineered, with a <b>counterweighted</b> crankshaft (quite a mathematical challenge at the time), overhead valves, and hydraulic tappets. It also had only two single barrel carburetors, one for each bank.|$|E
50|$|This type {{of double}} dump valve works essentially, like a stacked pair of trickle valves. Each flap plate is held {{closed with a}} <b>counterweighted</b> arm. As {{material}} builds up on the top plate {{the weight of the}} head of material pushes it open where it dumps onto the bottom plate. This type of double dump valve has no electrical or pneumatic controls and is the least expensive method of operation. However, it is difficult to sustain a properly timed cycle.|$|E

50|$|The bridge {{would be}} raised or lowered using ropes or chains {{attached}} to a windlass in a chamber in the gatehouse above the gate-passage. Only a very light bridge could be raised in this way without any form of counterweight, so some form of bascule arrangement is normally found.

50|$|Designed as a {{team effort}} by Brough, 'Ike' Hatch, and Freddie Dixon, the engine has two {{horizontally}} opposed flat twins one above the other and geared together, thus rotating counter to each other forming an H engine. Connecting rods from opposed cylinders were of the fork and blade type and thus shared a common crank pin. All pistons moved in unison, that is {{to the left or}} to the right at the same time. The pistons could thus be <b>counterweighted</b> 100% yielding a perfect balance. Primary, secondary and higher-order sources of vibration canceled each other, as did the gyroscopic effects from each crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|The Chamberlain Bridge is {{a bridge}} in Bridgetown, {{the capital and}} largest city {{of the nation of}} Barbados. In 1872, it was a swing bridge across the marine inlet channel of the inner basin of the Careenage (Constitution River) at Carlisle Bay. The out moded steel {{structure}} was dismantled and rebuilt in 2005-2006 as a lifting bridge with the state-of the-art modern technology of an all-composite single-leaf bascule design. This design is a <b>counterweighted</b> bridge span that pivots upward, permitting pleasure craft to pass through an inlet channel. The bridge was built using fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP), which is lighter, long lasting and non-corrosive.|$|E
50|$|He was {{recruited}} in 1926 by Cadillac general manager Lawrence P. Fisher (October 19, 1888 in Norwalk, Ohio - September 3, 1961 in Detroit, Michigan) {{to work at}} the Cadillac Division of General Motors Corporation (GM). Nacker became head of engine development. He designed a 45 degree Overhead valve V-8 with an aluminum crankcase, five main bearings, <b>counterweighted</b> crankshaft with a front vibration damper and timing chain driving the generator. Cylinder blocks included cast nickel-iron liners extending into the crankcase with cast iron heads. This was the engine for Cadillac Division's new 1927 LaSalle companion model.|$|E
50|$|The 303 CID L engine had {{hydraulic}} lifters, an oversquare bore:stroke ratio, a <b>counterweighted</b> forged crankshaft, aluminum pistons, floating wristpins, and a dual-plane intake manifold. The 303 {{was produced}} from 1949-1953. Bore was 3.75 in and stroke was 3.4375 in. Cadillac used a distantly related engine {{which appeared in}} three different sizes through to the 1962 model year; though the Oldsmobile and Cadillac motors were not physically related, many lessons learned by one division were incorporated into the others design, and the result were two engines known for their excellent power-to-weight ratio, fuel economy, and smooth, strong, reliable running.|$|E

5000|$|A {{bell prover}} (commonly {{referred}} to in the industry as a [...] "bell") consists of a vertical inner tank surrounded by an outer shell. A space between the inner tank and outer shell is filled with a sealing liquid, usually oil. An inverted tank, called the bell, is placed over the inner tank. The liquid provides an air-tight seal. Bell provers are typically <b>counterweighted</b> to provide positive pressure through a hose and valve connected to a meter. Sometimes rollers or guides are installed on the moving part of the bell which allows for smooth linear movement without the potential for immeasurable pressure differentials caused by the bell rocking back or forth.|$|E
50|$|Cadillac {{produced}} the first American V8 engine in a production vehicle, the 1914 L-Head. It was a sophisticated unit with cast iron paired closed-head cylinders bolted to an aluminium crankcase, and it used a flat-plane crankshaft. Peerless followed the next year, introducing a V8 licensed from amusement park manufacturer, Herschell-Spillman. By 1917 Chevrolet had also designed a V8 engine which it began mass-producing, advanced in its design the engine had a central camshaft operating vertical overhead valves in each cylinder bank. The engine design used a <b>counterweighted</b> crankshaft, and detachable crossflow cylinder head, displacing 288 cubic inch and producing, for the period, an impressive 55 horsepower. It was primarily {{used in the}} Chevrolet Series D.|$|E
50|$|The Top Spin is {{a thrill}} ride {{developed}} by HUSS Park Attractions, {{and is the}} generic name {{for a series of}} rides from other manufacturers that follow the same principle. The ride consists of a passenger platform suspended between two <b>counterweighted</b> arms. The arms are turned by motors, while the platform generally only has brakes that are engaged and disengaged at various points of the ride cycle. A typical top spin program runs the main arm motors while engaging and disengaging the platform brakes so that it will rotate in exciting ways. The minimum rider height requirement is 54 inches; maximum is 80 inches due to the seat and restraint design. The ride was debuted in 1990 with it proving an instant success with European fairgoers.|$|E
50|$|When fitting an L28 with an LD28 {{crankshaft}} {{with standard}} bored cylinders {{it increases the}} engine displacement from 2.8 L (2753 cc) to about 2900 cc. It was never actually produced by Nissan, {{but it is a}} very easy and common modification to the L28 done by many Skyline and Z car enthusiasts. The most popular modification is the 3 mm overbored (89 mm) L3.1 litre (3096 cc); some add a turbo or two, but the more common setup is the triple Solex or Weber carburators. The only downside is that LD28 cranks are expensive- used units are scarce, but new units are available from the factory. Fully <b>counterweighted</b> 83 mm stroke and even 85 mm stroke cranks can be bought from aftermarket companies.|$|E
5000|$|The signals {{used on the}} Great Northern to {{work the}} block system were lower {{quadrant}} semaphores. A lever in the signal box was connected by a wire (under tension, and passing over intermediate pulleys) to a <b>counterweighted</b> arm on the signal. To set a signal to all clear, the signalman pulled the appropriate lever in his signal box; this moved the arm down (which was pivoted in a slot in the signal post), against {{the pull of the}} counterweight, [...] "to a vertical position in the post". When the lever was moved to set the signal to danger, this did not positively drive the signal to “danger” but paid out slack in the wire and allowed the counterweight to take the arm to a horizontal position.|$|E
5000|$|The theatre {{was built}} with the {{intention}} of presenting both live performances and films. The stage of the theatre was equipped with a full <b>counterweighted</b> fly system with the 50'-0" [...] wide screen rigged to be flown in and out. In front of the stage, a three segment orchestra pit was installed. One segment, on left side of the pit as viewed from the audience, contained the pipe organ console. The organ lift could rise independently and rotate. The remaining width of the orchestra pit could also raise, lifting the orchestra up to the stage level. The third segment was an integrated piano lift {{in the center of the}} orchestra lift that could either rise independently or with the orchestra lift.|$|E
