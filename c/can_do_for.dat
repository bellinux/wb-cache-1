In her vision she and Che heatedly debate her actions; Che accuses Eva of using the Argentine people for her own ends and silencing people who do not support her, while Eva cynically replies that there is no glory in trying to solve the world's problems from the sidelines ("A Waltz for Eva and Che"). At the end of the argument, Eva finally admits to herself and Che that she is dying and can't go on for much longer. Afterwards, Eva finally understands that Perón loves her for herself, not just for what she <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> him and his career ("You Must Love Me").|$|E

500|$|The plot of Rob-B-Hood {{received}} mixed reviews: The Chinese newspaper Xiao Xiang Chen Bao {{found it}} concise, hilarious and touching, whereas Jay Weissberg criticised it for being unoriginal. In addition, Felix Cheong of Channel NewsAsia found the subplots involving the antagonists' families redundant, detracting {{from the main}} story and making the film [...] "tediously long". However, Chan was praised for his decision to play a darker character in Rob-B-Hood. Andrew Sun of South China Morning Post stated that [...] "one {{of the best things}} Chan <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> his flagging movie career is to play a heavy—a nasty, scum-of-the-earth antagonist, since you do not always have to play a hero to be a hero." [...] Sun emphasised the need for Chan to show flexibility in his roles, citing a number of actors that have thrived by playing the occasional villain.|$|E

[...] "This action has cost me an Officer's Commission, and ... my citizenship may be revoked, [...] this is the most I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> my country under the circumstances." [...] He told the historian Gerald Horne that he believed communists had already compromised top levels of the US government, and that by serving in Rhodesia he was helping to unify [...] "his people" [...] against a foreign conspiracy. His religious views also affected his views on Zionism: he believed that the State of Israel's existence prior to the Second Coming of Christ was contrary to scriptural prophecies, and that it should therefore be destroyed.|$|E

500|$|To Stanford's regret, many of {{his pupils}} who {{achieved}} eminence as composers broke away from his classical, Brahmsian precepts, as he had himself rebelled against Reinecke's conservatism. The composer George Dyson wrote, [...] "In a certain sense the very rebellion he fought was the most obvious fruit of his methods. And in view of what some of these rebels have since achieved, {{one is tempted to}} wonder whether there is really anything better a teacher <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> his pupils than drive them into various forms of revolution." [...] The works of some of Stanford's pupils, including Holst and Vaughan Williams, entered the general repertory in Britain, and to some extent elsewhere, as Stanford's never did. For many years after his death it seemed that Stanford's greatest fame would be as a teacher. Among his achievements at the RCM was the establishment of an opera class, with at least one operatic production every year. From 1885 to 1915 there were 32 productions, all of them conducted by Stanford.|$|E

[...] Drowned in Sound gave the album an eight out of ten rating, finding that the album is [...] "equally impressive is the fact that this formula (or lack thereof) never grows tired.

500|$|Rather than {{emphasize}} winning, Tunis {{believed that}} values like {{hard work and}} perseverance could be taught through sports. The 1951football brochure for the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology Athletic Scholarship committee cites Tunis, saying [...] "The athletic department would like {{to feel that the}} existing program <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> the engineer what John Tunis had in mind when he said, 'The deep objective of games really is to train one’s reflex of purpose to develop a habit of keeping steadily at something you want until it is done. Many of Tunis' biggest heroes find themselves eventually brought low, like Roy Tucker in The Kid Comes Back, whose wartime service injury may have destroyed his career, or Iron Duke Jim Wellington at Harvard, ostracized and lonely, who perseveres by running track. The real victory is in the character's refusal to give up against long odds. [...] "My heroes are the losers" [...] he once said. [...] "All my books have been in that vein.

Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character {{for three and a half}} years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them – it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!" [...] Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012.|$|E
500|$|To {{supplement}} Hardy's endorsement, Gilbert Walker, {{a former}} mathematical lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge, looked at Ramanujan's work and expressed amazement, urging {{the young man}} to spend time at Cambridge.

While he was engaged as a research student, Ramanujan continued to submit papers to the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society. In one instance, Narayana Iyer submitted some of Ramanujan's theorems on summation of series to the journal, adding, [...] "The following theorem is due to S. Ramanujan, the mathematics student of Madras University." [...] Later in November, British Professor Edward B. Ross of Madras Christian College, whom Ramanujan had met a few years before, stormed into his class one day with his eyes glowing, asking his students, [...] "Does Ramanujan know Polish?" [...] The reason was that in one paper, Ramanujan had anticipated the work of a Polish mathematician whose paper had just arrived in the day's mail. In his quarterly papers, Ramanujan drew up theorems to make definite integrals more easily solvable. Working off Giuliano Frullani's 1821 integral theorem, Ramanujan formulated generalisations that could be made to evaluate formerly unyielding integrals.|$|E
