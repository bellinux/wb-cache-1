50|$|<b>Crews</b> <b>of</b> 'flame' {{tanks were}} not {{necessarily}} more vulnerable than those crews in the regular, standard version of the tank (a Churchill 'Crocodile' flame tank being more or less as vulnerable to anti-tank weapons as the standard Churchill), but the <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> flamethrowing tanks were often treated differently should they be captured alive by enemy troops. Due to the perceived inhumanity of the weapon itself, captured <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> such tanks were often treated much less humanely than <b>crews</b> <b>of</b> regular tanks. Instances of 'flametankers' being executed by the opposite troops upon capture were not uncommon. Subsequently, British tank crews received sixpence a day extra 'danger money' due {{to the threat of}} arbitrary execution. Flame tanks also suffered from the fact, along with flamethrower-armed troops, that all enemy within range would usually open up on them due to the fear of the weapon.|$|R
