5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations {{to lose their}} jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed. During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and {{separation of church and}} state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1865, {{two days}} after the {{announcement}} that the States had ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery, Wilson introduced a bill to protect the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> African Americans. Although Wilson's bill failed to pass Congress it was effectively the same bill as the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that passed Congress over Johnson's veto on April 9, 1866.|$|E
2500|$|Mitchell, nicknamed [...] "the 101st U.S. Senator", waged {{a tireless}} {{campaign}} on Capitol Hill, helping to secure passage <b>of</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> {{legislation in the}} 1950s and 1960s: the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1957, the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1960, the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1964, the Voting <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1965 and the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII <b>of</b> the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1968).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1957 was {{the first}} piece <b>of</b> Federal <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> {{legislation}} in almost a century, and would {{pave the way for}} the climactic <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1964.|$|R
50|$|Provisions {{contained}} in the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1875 were later readopted by Congress during the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Movement as part <b>of</b> the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1964 and the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1968.

5|$|Magoffin and the {{legislature}} continued to clash throughout {{the remainder of}} 1861 and into 1862. They found agreement only on the most menial of legislation, such as a bill to allow the common schools to continue the sessions that had been interrupted by the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. He found particularly onerous a bill forfeiting the citizenship of anyone who fought for or aided the Confederacy, but in March 1862, his veto of the bill was overridden. Magoffin also opposed the military rule of Brigadier General Jeremiah T. Boyle, who he believed was violating the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> states' rights advocates, {{even if they did}} not advocate secession.|$|E
5|$|The Weiquan {{movement}} is a non-centralized group of lawyers, legal experts, and intellectuals in China {{who seek to}} protect and defend the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the citizenry through litigation and legal activism. The movement, {{which began in the}} early 2000s, has organized demonstrations, sought reform via the legal system and media, defended victims of human rights abuses, and written appeal letters, despite opposition from Communist Party authorities. Among the issues adopted by Weiquan lawyers are property and housing rights, protection for AIDS victims, environmental damage, religious freedom, freedom of speech and the press, and defending the rights of other lawyers facing disbarment or imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century wore on non-conformist ministers {{increasingly}} {{began to}} conduct services within the workhouse, but Catholic priests were rarely welcomed. A variety of legislation {{had been introduced}} during the 17th century to limit the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> Catholics, beginning with the Popish Recusants Act 1605 {{in the wake of}} the failed Gunpowder Plot that year. But although almost all restrictions on Catholics in England and Ireland were removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, a great deal of anti-Catholic feeling remained. Even in areas with large Catholic populations, such as Liverpool, the appointment of a Catholic chaplain was unthinkable. Some guardians went so far as to refuse Catholic priests entry to the workhouse.|$|E
2500|$|Mitchell {{continued}} {{to serve as}} an NAACP lobbyist to Congress through the 1960s, as the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement reached new peaks in demonstrations and increasing national awareness through campaigns in the South. Mitchell helped secure passage of the era's critical <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> legislation: the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1960, the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1964, the Voting <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1965 and the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII <b>of</b> the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1968).

50|$|After the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1866 {{had been}} enacted into law over President Andrew Johnson's veto, {{some members of}} Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to {{eliminate}} doubts about the constitutionality <b>of</b> the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1866, or {{to ensure that no}} subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. Thus, the Citizenship Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment parallels citizenship language in the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1866, and likewise the Equal Protection Clause parallels nondiscrimination language in the 1866 Act; the extent to which other clauses in the Fourteenth Amendment may have incorporated elements <b>of</b> the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1866 is a matter of continuing debate.|$|R

5|$|Immediately upon reopening his business, Johnson started {{publishing}} theological and political works by Priestley and other Dissenters. Starting in the 1770s, Johnson published more specifically Unitarian works, {{as well as}} texts advocating religious toleration; he also became personally involved in the Unitarian cause. He served as a conduit for information between Dissenters {{across the country and}} supplied provincial publishers with religious publications, thereby enabling Dissenters to spread their beliefs easily. Johnson participated in efforts to repeal the Test and Corporation Acts, which restricted the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> Dissenters. In one six-year period of the 1770s, Johnson was responsible for publishing nearly one-third of the Unitarian works on the issue. He continued his support in 1787, 1789, and 1790, when Dissenters introduced repeal bills in Parliament, and he published much of the pro-repeal literature written by Priestley and others.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{opposition}} to the proposed amendment was the women's suffrage movement, which {{before and during the}} Civil War had made common cause with the abolitionist movement. However, {{with the passage of the}} Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> women divorced from those of blacks. Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not gender discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the American Equal Rights Association, the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the National Woman Suffrage Association of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who opposed the amendment, and the American Woman Suffrage Association of Lucy Stone and Henry Browne Blackwell, who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The Government tasks the Prime Minister, the First Vice-Prime Minister for Economy and Minister of Finance, Minister of Interior, Minister of Defense, Minister of Industry and Trade, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Agriculture and Minister of Labor and Social Affairs to (1) conduct {{any and all}} procedural, {{political}} and diplomatic measures necessary to prevent adoption of such a proposal of European Directive, that would amend the Directive No. 91/477/EEC {{in a way which}} would excessively affect the rights of the citizens of the Czech Republic and which would have negative effect on internal order, defense capabilities and economical or labor situation in the Czech Republic and (2) enforce such changes to the proposal of directive that would amend the directive no. 91/477/EEC that will allow preservation of the current level of <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> citizens of the Czech Republic and which will prevent negative impact on internal order, defense capabilities and economical and labor situation in the Czech Republic.|$|E
25|$|TitleVIII <b>of</b> the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1968 is {{commonly}} known as the Fair Housing Act and was meant as a follow‑up to the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1964. While the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1866 prohibited discrimination in housing, there were no federal enforcement provisions. The 1968 act expanded on previous acts and prohibited discrimination concerning the sale, rental, and financing of housing based on race, religion, national origin, and since 1974, gender; since 1988, the act protects people with disabilities and families with children.|$|R
50|$|Rauh also lobbied Congress for {{the passage}} <b>of</b> many <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> bills, having {{a hand in}} the passing <b>of</b> the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1964, the Voting <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1965, and the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1968.

5000|$|The <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Cases, 109 US 3 (1883) were a {{group of}} five US Supreme Court {{constitutional}} law cases. Against the famous dissent of Justice Harlan, a majority held the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1875 was unconstitutional, because Congress lacked authority to regulate private affairs under the Fourteenth Amendment, and that the Thirteenth Amendment [...] "merely abolishes slavery". The <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1875 had banned race discrimination in access to services offered to the public. The decision was effectively reversed in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court from 1937, and finally by legislation under the <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act <b>of</b> 1964.|$|R
5|$|Though widely {{respected}} in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial First Lady {{at the time}} for her outspokenness, particularly her stance on racial issues. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show, and speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies. She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, {{for the families of}} unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> African Americans and Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic nominee was Samuel J. Tilden, the Governor of New York. Tilden was {{considered}} a formidable adversary who, like Hayes, {{had a reputation for}} honesty. Also like Hayes, Tilden was a hard-money man and supported civil service reform. In accordance with the custom of the time, the campaign was conducted by surrogates, with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns. The poor economic conditions made the party in power unpopular and made Hayes suspect that he might lose the election. Both candidates focused their attention on the swing states of New York and Indiana, as well as the three southern states—Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida—where Reconstruction governments still barely ruled, amid recurring political violence. The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after southern Democrats provoked the Civil War and, to a lesser extent, the danger a Democratic administration would pose to the recently won <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> southern blacks. Democrats, for their part, trumpeted Tilden's record of reform and contrasted it with the corruption of the incumbent Grant administration.|$|E
