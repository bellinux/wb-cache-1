40|$|One of {{the methods}} to {{determine}} the influence of the road surfaces characteristics on the emission of noise by road traffic is the so-called Close Proximity (<b>CPX)</b> <b>method,</b> which measures the noise emission of the tyre-road contact in the near field of a sound radiating tyre. These measurements are executed with CPX measurement trailers. Experience in the Netherlands and in other European countries has shown that CPX measurements may suffer from a relatively large measurement uncertainty. In order to quantify the actual measurement uncertainty for the Dutch CPX trailers and to develop guidelines for further reduction of the measurement uncertainty a round robin test was held in the Netherlands in 2008. In 2011 this investigation was repeated and enlarged by the participation of three CPXtrailers from other European countries...|$|E
40|$|Low noise road {{pavements}} can {{be considered}} as attractive means for road traffic noise reduction. An overview of the current low noise pavements used in France is presented in this paper. Their acoustic performances and the strategies of use are discussed. In parallel to the development of low noise pavements, measurement methods were developed in order to quantify their acoustic performance. This performance can be introduced in noise predicting models, or can give relevant information to support strategic decisions of road authorities. The pass-by noise measurement method is traditionally used for this evaluation, but due to many restrictions of application, dynamic close proximity measurement devices (CPX) are currently developed all around the world. The <b>CPX</b> <b>method</b> recently standardized in France is described in the paper.

The model provides an easy way to estimate the instantaneous tyre/road noise level.

The CPX and CB measurement methods have been used simultaneously on each road surface at vehicle speeds ranging between 50 km/h and 110 km/h. A very good correlation between overall CPX and CB noise levels recomposed between 400 Hz and 4000 Hz was observed which is consistent with previous results of the literature. With the whole set of road surfaces and frequencies, a fairly good correlation between the CPX and CB spectral noise levels was also observed. Taking each road surface individually, an excellent spectral correlation was observed, leading to a very accurate estimation of the overall CB noise levels from the CPX noise levels. Considering each one-third octave band frequency, the correlations between CPX and CB spectral noise levels were also good and enable to estimate the overall CB noise levels with the same accuracy as when using the correlation between the overall CPX and CB noise levels. As a perspective, the results could help to compare different tyre/road noise prediction models which have been calibrated or validated with different testing method (pass-by or close-proximity) ...|$|R

We assessed the prognostic role of EOB vs other clinical and ventilatory parameters in elderly HF patients performing a maximal <b>CPX.</b> <b>Methods</b> and results: We prospectively followed-up 370 HF outpatients &# 8805; 65 years after a symptom limited CPX. We tested the predictive value of clinical and ventilatory parameters for all-cause mortality and a composite of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalizations. Median age was 74 years, 51 % had ischemic heart disease, 25 % NYHA class III; ejection fraction was 41 % [34 - 50]. Peak oxygen consumption (PVO 2) was 11. 9 [9. 9 - 14] mL/kg/min, {{the slope of the}} regression line relating ventilation to CO 2 output, (VE/VCO 2 slope) was 33. 9 [29. 8 - 39. 2]. EOB was found in 58 % of patients. At follow-up, 84 patients died and overall 158, using atime-to-first event approach, met the composite end-point. Independent predictors of all-cause mortality were CPX EOB and the ratio of VE/VCO 2 slope to peak VO 2, hemoglobin, creatinine and body mass index. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the Cox multivariable model was 0. 80 (95 % CI 0. 73 to 0. 87).

40|$|The {{road traffic}} noise {{is one of}} the major {{contributors}} to environmental noise, which can cause considerable impact on public health and quality of life of populations. However, road noise raises several questions because, if on one hand is associated with several health problems and welfare, on the other hand its lack affects the detection of the sound sources, and consequently it constitutes a risk to the safety of road users. Thus, it becomes essential to classify road pavements not only based on acoustic indicators but also based on psychoacoustic indicators. Therefore, this work aims to contribute to pavement classification from the point of view of psychoacoustics. An innovative approach leading to important methodological advantages was done by using the Close proximity Method (<b>CPX)</b> <b>method</b> to acquire tyre-road noise. This work presents the acoustic characterization of five different types of pavement by using three acoustic and psychoacoustic indicators (LAmax, LAeq and Loudness) as a function of speed.

40|$|Road {{traffic noise}} is {{associated}} with several health problems and welfare; such as sleep disturbances and annoyance. Accordingly, it becomes essential to characterize road noise not only based on acoustic indicators, but also based on psychoacoustic indicators.

In this context, this work aimed to explore tyre-road noise measurements acquired on eight road pavements at eight speeds, {{from the point of}} view of psychoacoustics.

This paper presents a study where noise and rolling resistance properties of tyres for winter conditions are compared to summer and all-season tyres. The winter tyres include types optimized for central European climate, tyres optimized for Nordic climate and tyres with studs. In total, approx. 50 car tyres have been tested.

H 577 M ME 2015 Lamxiii, 185 pages :color illustrationsNotwithstanding {{decades of}} {{governmental}} and public efforts,traffic noise problem in Hong Kong is still severe. Since the contribution by tyre/road noise is predominant, assessment {{to it is}} necessary. Close-Proximity Method is a standard tyre/road noise measurement methodology (ISO/CD 11819 - 2) that works by towing a trailer installed with test tyres and microphones to travel on a road section to measure the noise emitted. The reliability of its application in highly urbanized city is in doubt because of the severe disturbances to the measurement in real practice. They include the high background traffic noise,the road bumpiness, the substantial variation of temperature and the variation due to road curvature. This study aims to develop a <b>CPX</b> <b>Method</b> suitable for tyre/road noise measurement in highly urbanized city with minimal influence from these disturbances. The development of the PolyU Mark II CPX Trailer is described in this study. It is equipped with an acoustically treated enclosure for shielding the external disturbing noise with minimized internal reflection. Experiments were conducted to evaluate its acoustic performance against the certification criteria stipulated in ISO/CD 11819 - 2. The Mark II has passed. The vibration of the microphones installed inside the CPX trailer excited by its travel over road bumpiness induces error to the measurement results. Experimental results indicate the error {{can lead to a}} noise level overestimation as much as 3 dB(A). To alleviate such error,a correction method is proposed and illustrated. Tyre/road noise is sensitive to air temperature. ISO/CD 11819 - 2 suggests temperature correction to alleviate its influence. The correction is optional since temperature constants vary for different road surface types. The correction is however necessary in Hong Kong due to the relatively large temperature variation. Experiment was devised to yield the air and road surface temperature constants of two local common asphalt road surface types. Road surface temperature is found more reliable than air temperature for the correction. The choices of road sections are limited in this highly urbanized city. Sometimes it is inevitable to adopt curved road as test section. Cornering is anticipated to influence tyre/road noise radiation. Study was conducted to assess the curvature effect. Results indicate that the road curvature effect can reach up to 2 dB(A). The minimum critical radii for CPX measurement are yielded for two speeds. The radius is found to be higher for higher vehicle speed. Through evaluating the levels of influences by the disturbances above and proposals of corrective measures to the errors resulted from them, the present study contributes to the reliability of <b>CPX</b> <b>Method</b> for tyre/road noise measurement in highly urbanized city.

In addition to noise mitigation by erection of the expensive noise barriers, tire/pavement noise can be reduced “in source” by construction of special asphalt pavements.

40|$|On {{high-volume}} roads {{cement concrete}} surfaces may be economically favourable {{in comparison to}} asphalt concrete. When a bypass for motorway E 4 in Uppsala (Sweden) was built, cement concrete was therefore selected as the wearing course. It {{is well known that}} noise characteristics of cement concrete surfaces may be poor unless a suitable texture is created. Earlier, the Swedish Road Administration has used the exposed aggregate technique to create a favourable surface texture on newly laid cement concrete on some motorways in Sweden, with both good and poor results. This time a special aggregate grading of the top layer was selected, attempting to combine the desire to have excellent durability against the wear of studded tyres in winter, and the desire to limit tyre/road noise emission from the motorway. Being a bypass, this motorway at some locations run rather near to suburban areas where noise immission might become a serious issue. Noise measurements were made with the <b>CPX</b> <b>method,</b> using four test tyres. The results on the exposed aggregate cement concrete (EACC) were compared with similar measurements on SMA surfaces with the same maximum aggregate size.

The results indicated approx. 2 - 3 dB(A) lower tyre/road noise emission on the EACC than on the SMA 0 / 16 which was better than expected. In the paper the probable causes of the relatively low noise emission are analyzed. The positive results suggest that with a suitable proportioning of the aggregate in the surface layer and high quality exposure technique, the EACC may be used as a standard technique for texturing of cement concrete...|$|E
40|$|Traffic {{noise is}} one of the main sources of {{acoustic}} pollution, with an ubiquitous presence in anthropised environments. Therefore, it is a constant component of residual noise during every noise measurement. The generation and propagation of traffic noise is governed by three main different mechanisms: vehicles' power unit (i. e. the engine, gearbox and cooling system), vehicles' profile aerodynamics and tyre-road interaction. While engine noise is the main source up to 35 km/h, for higher speeds propulsion noise is negligible over noise due to tyre/road interaction. For heavy vehicles, like lorries, the contribution of propulsion noise cannot be neglected even at higher speeds. Tyre/road interaction depends greatly on the characteristics of road surfaces: a subtle difference in road surfaces may yield a large variation in noise levels. This idea has lead to a series of studies that focused on providing theoretical and phenomenological analysis of the influence of road profile on noise emission. The characterisation of a road surface requires the measurement of its profile: the device used to carry out these measurements is known as profilometer; modern road profilometry is based on laser triangulation sensors, which allow a simple and direct measurement of road texture. The purpose of this work, carried out at the CNR spin-off company iPool srl, was to develop a laser profilometer focused on measuring the macrotexture and megatexture of road pavements, which cover wavelengths of the same order of magnitude as the size of tyre tread elements and of the tyre/road interface and to verify some of the existing models to predict tyre rolling noise based on road texture knowledge. This work confirms the importance of macrotexture (MaTx) and part of megatexture (MeTx) in the generation of rolling noise. The profilometer, mounted on a vehicle, is composed of a laser displacement sensor, an accelerometer, known in jargon as inertial unit and a rotary encoder attached to a wheel, which provides the horizontal travelled distance. This profilometer presents many strong points, viz. a simple usage and relative low cost compared to other laser profilometers; moreover it presents a new procedure to obtain the road profile by combining the information provided by the laser output, a time-domain displacement signal and a record of the distance travelled by the vehicle, measured by the angular encoder. Chapter 1 provides a description of the main terminology and devices used in profiling, while chapter 2 deals the essential theoretical background of the dominant phenomena involved in the generation of rolling noise and describes the main models that correlate rolling noise and road texture. Chapter 3 accurately explains every component the profilometer; it is roughly divided in two main parts, the first one outlines the hardware components specifications and limits, while the second part overviews the signal processing. An algorithm in Matlab environment for data processing was also developed, dealing with the re-mapping of the time-domain vertical displacement signal with a constant sampling frequency to a space-domain profile, sampled every 0. 5 mm, and subsequent evaluation of road texture parameters has been conducted on different sites. A simple mathematical model of road texture enveloped by the tyre has also been used during data analysis, simulating the actual road surface that is in contact with the tyre. The following chapter addresses the possible sources of uncertainty of profiling operations. A theoretical model of the response of the laser sensor at different wavelengths has also been developed, taking into account the finite spot size of the laser and the finite exposure time of the pixel array. These two factors contribute to the identification of the working range of the sensor. Chapter 5 presents a calibration of the device and consequent assessment of reproducibility and repeatability of measurements. Calibration has dealt with every component singularly through specific measurements, such as measurements of the lateral profile of a rotating disc with cogs of different sizes, calibration of the accelerometer with a B&K calibrator and an oscillating bar, and the measurement of the profile of a surface with known characteristics. Repeatability of measurements has been thoroughly verified, via repetitions of measurements of the same road profile; reproducibility has been checked by measuring the same road profile with another profilometer already available on the market, and owned by the Department of Civil Engineering of Università di Pisa. Finally, an evaluation of the correlation between rolling noise and road texture is presented in chapter 6. Measurements of road texture provided by the profilometer are correlated with rolling noise emission on six different kinds of pavements: again, the chapter can be divided in two main sections. The former deals with the calculation of the correlation coefficient between parameters related to road texture, such as third-octave bands texture spectrum and rolling noise measured by <b>CPX</b> <b>method,</b> while the latter deals with the comparison of two existing models and the elaboration of a simple model to obtain the mean CPX broadband level of a road surface based the knowledge of its texture spectrum. The model uses two bands of the octave band texture spectrum, to predict rolling noise: the octave band centred at 5 mm, related to air pumping, is negatively correlated to sound generation, while the band at 80 mm shows a positive correlation, related to tyre vibrations. One of the main innovations of this model, despite the limited number of samples, is the usage of enveloped texture, which distinguishes road surfaces with sharp edges and deep grooves. The correlations found confirm the theoretical knowledge of tyre/road noise, but also underline that a complete description of rolling noise must take into account not only road texture, but also the tyre itself. In fact, a resonance in the CPX noise spectrum at 80 km/h was also successfully identified. The further perfectioning of the profilometer will permit deeper studies of the correlation between properties of road texture and rolling noise, and to develop a comprehensive model of tyre/road interaction noise: possible improvements are the simultaneous usage of two or more displacement sensors that profile adjacent lines, in order to reduce uncertainty in the evaluation of texture spectrum and the substitution of the current sensor with one that has a smaller spot size...|$|E
