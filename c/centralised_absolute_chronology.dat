2500|$|Two {{types of}} chronologies can be distinguished: a {{relative}} <b>chronology</b> and an <b>absolute</b> <b>chronology.</b> The former establishes {{the order of}} phases, periods, cultures and reigns, whereas the latter establishes their absolute age expressed in years. In archaeology, relative chronologies are established by carefully excavating archaeological sites and reconstructing their stratigraphy – {{the order in which}} layers were deposited. In general, newer remains are deposited on top of older material. <b>Absolute</b> <b>chronologies</b> are established by dating remains, or the layers in which they are found, through absolute dating methods. These methods include radiocarbon dating and the written record that can provide year names or calendar dates.|$|R

40|$|The Chronology of {{the luxurious}} women's {{jewellery}} in the Early Mediaeval period and its historical significance. This PhD thesis {{deals with the}} dating of women's luxurious jewellery {{in the area of}} South Moravia in Early Mediaeval period. The aim of the thesis is ordering of women's jewellery sets into relative chronological sequence. The impetus for the analysis of jewellery was the recognition of some discrepancies in the relative chronology of the cemetery at Staré Město "Na valách", which was the basis of relative chronology of 9 th century material culture in previous decades. After the division of women's jewellery assemblages into three relative-chronological phases, the author tries to define these phases in the terms of <b>absolute</b> <b>chronology.</b> New insights into the dating of the woman jewellery open the question of its origin and new views on its historical interpretation and significance.

Observed results encouraged CryoSoniC accuracy evaluation on genuine mortars sampled from archeological sites of known or independently constrained age (i. e., other 14 C dates on different materials). In this study, some 14 C measurements performed on genuine mortars will be discussed and compared with independently estimated (i. e., radiocarbon/archaeometrical dating) <b>absolute</b> <b>chronologies</b> of two Spanish sites. Observed results confirm the agreement of the CryoSoniC mortar dates with the archaeological expectations for both examined cases. Several authors reported the possibility of obtaining accurate radiocarbon dates of mortar matrices by analyzing lime lumps: binder-related particles of different sizes exclusively composed of calcium carbonate. In this paper, preliminary data for the <b>absolute</b> <b>chronology</b> reconstruction of the Basilica of the cemetery complex of Ponte della Lama (Canosa di Puglia, Italy) based on lime lumps will also be discussed.

40|$|The <b>absolute</b> <b>chronology</b> of the 4 th and 3 rd {{millennium}} BCE in the Southern Caucasus {{constitutes a}} controversial issue within current archaeological research, with special {{regards to the}} Kura-Araxes (KA) culture.

A first integrative revision of this <b>absolute</b> <b>chronology</b> from the Late Chalcolithic (LC) {{to the end of the}} Early Bronze Age (EBA) was undertaken in this study, with the collection of available 14 C dates referring to the KA culture, which were framed between pre-KA and post-KA horizons and assessed using modern 14 C analytical tools based on Bayesian principles. Preliminary observations on data and results reveal the occurrence of sub-regional offsets and a fragmentation of the KA chronological record in local patterns.

Observed results confirmed the overall successful character of the proposed methodology encouraging its accuracy testing on real samples by comparing mortar radiocarbon dates with other materials of known or constraint age. 	In this study, some 14 C measurements performed on archaeological mortars will be discussed and compared with independently estimated (i. e. radiocarbon dating performed on organic materials found in the same study site) <b>absolute</b> <b>chronologies</b> of 2 Spanish sites. Observed results confirm the overall agreement of the mortar isolated fractions dates with the chronological reconstruction for both examined sites. Moreover several authors reported the possibility to obtain accurate radiocarbon dating results of mortar matrices by analyzing lime lumps: binder related particles of different sizes composed exclusively by calcium carbonate. Hence, in this paper, preliminary data for the <b>absolute</b> <b>chronology</b> reconstruction of the Basilica of the cemetery complex of Ponte della Lama (Canosa di Puglia, Italy) based mostly on lime lumps will, also, be discussed.
