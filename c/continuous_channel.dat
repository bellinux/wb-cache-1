5000|$|A [...] "continuous-dynode" [...] {{structure}} is feasible if {{the material of}} the electrodes has a high resistance so that the functions of secondary-emission and voltage-division are merged. This is often built as a funnel of glass coated inside with a thin film of semi-conducting material, with negative high voltage applied at the wider input end, and positive voltage near ground applied at the narrower output end.

50|$|Plant {{cells are}} {{surrounded}} by cell walls which are barriers for cell-cell communication. This barrier is overcome by specialized junctions called plasmodesmata. They are similar to gap junctions, connecting the cytosol of adjacent cells. Small molecules (<1000 Da), such as ions, amino acids, and sugars, can diffuse freely through plasmodesmata. These small molecules include signaling molecule and transcription factors. The size of the channel is also regulated to allow molecules up to 10,000 Da in size. The permeability of these channels is dependent on many factors, including Ca2+ concentration. An increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration will reversibly limit passage through the plasmodesmata. Unlike gap junctions, the cell membranes of adjacent cells merge to form a <b>continuous</b> <b>channel</b> called an annulus. Additionally, within the channel, there {{is an extension of}} the endoplasmic reticulum, called a desmotubule, which spans between the cells. The cell-cell interactions facilitated by plasmodesmata {{play an important role in}} development of plant cells and tissues and defense against viral infection.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 19th century, Congress {{passed a}} series of {{initiatives}} to improve navigation on the Tennessee River between the river's mouth and Florence, Alabama. By the 1890s, a 5 ft <b>continuous</b> <b>channel</b> had been secured, but was still deemed insufficient for major river traffic. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted an extensive survey of the lower river in the early 1900s, and recommended constructing a dam at Aurora Landing (roughly 20 mi above the present site), but the project was never funded. In the 1930s, the Tennessee Valley Authority sought to create a continuous minimum 9 ft channel along {{the entirety of the}} river from Paducah to Knoxville. The Authority also sought to help control flooding on the lower Mississippi River, especially {{in the aftermath of the}} destructive Ohio River flood of 1937. Research had shown that 4% of the water in the lower Mississippi originates in the Tennessee River watershed. TVA surveyed the lower part of the river and considered the Aurora Landing site, but eventually settled on the present site at river mile 22.4.

5000|$|RTX {{proteins}} {{range from}} 40 to over 600 kDa {{in size and}} all contain C-terminally located glycine and aspartate-rich repeat sequences of nine amino acids. The repeats contain the common sequence structure GGXGXDXL/I/V/W/Y/FX, (where X represents any amino acid), {{but the number of}} repeats varies within RTX protein family members. [...] These consensus regions function as sites for Ca2+ binding, which facilitate folding of the RTX protein following export via an ATP-mediated type 1 secretion system (T1SS). Most of the T1SS proteins are encoded within the rtx operon. The T1SS proteins form a <b>continuous</b> <b>channel</b> spanning both the inner membrane (IM) and outer membrane (OM) of the bacterial cell, preventing RTX toxin exposure to the periplasmic space (between the IM and OM). Type 1 secretion system components include: an ABC transporter (TC# 3.A.1), a membrane fusion protein (MFP; TC# 8.A.1), and an outer membrane protein (OMF; TC# 1.B.17). The OMF is often encoded outside of the rtx operon as it may have multiple functions within the cell. In Escherichia coli, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Vibrio cholerae, TolC functions as the OMP in T1SS RTX toxin export. In each case, the tolC gene is located outside the rtx operon and encodes a conserved multifunctional protein. During transport, the T1SS recognizes the C-terminal repeats of the RTX toxin, and the C-terminus is transferred first through the channel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new family}} of block codes referred to as Trellis Coded Block (TCB) codes, which are built using a trellis code and a linear block code (LBC). The TCB code (TCBC) construction {{is based on an}} algebraic structure inherent to many LBCs, which allows one to partition an LBC into sub-sets with a constant distance between every pair of code words in the sub-set. The proposed &nbsp;uniform sub-set partitioning is used to increase the minimum distance of the code,as in trellis coded modulation (TCM). However, unlike conventional TCM, the coding and modulation steps are separated in TCBC. An advantage of this construction is that it can be applied to both discrete as well as <b>continuous</b> <b>channels,</b> while conventional TCM is typically designed for <b>continuous</b> <b>channels.</b> The proposed TCBC is shown to be useful in a varietyof applications including forward error correction, low rate quasi-orthogonal sequence generation, lattice code construction, etc. Moreover, the encoder and decoder for TCBC are realized using off the-shelf trellis and block encoders and trellis decoders. Simulation results demonstrate the performance benefits offered by the TCBC in a variety of applications, and compares them to other existing state of-the-art codes...|$|R
