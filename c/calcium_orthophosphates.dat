40|$|The present {{overview}} {{is intended}} to point the readers’ attention to the important subject of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates.</b> These materials are of the special significance because they represent the inorganic part of major normal (bones, teeth and dear antlers) and pathological (i. e. those appearing due to various diseases) calcified tissues of mammals. Due to a great chemical similarity with the biological calcified tissues, many <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> possess remarkable biocompatibility and bioactivity. Materials scientists use this property extensively to construct artificial bone grafts that are either entirely made of or only surface-coated with the biologically relevant <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates.</b> For example, self-setting hydraulic cements made of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> are helpful in bone repair, while titanium substitutes covered by a surface layer of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> are used for hip joint endoprostheses and as tooth substitutes. Porous scaffolds made of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> are very promising tools for tissue engineering applications. In addition, technical grade <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> are very popular mineral fertilizers. Thus ere <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> are of great significance for humankind and, in this paper, an overview on the current knowledge on this subject is provided...|$|E
30|$|As {{follows from}} the definition, all types of wet {{deposition}} techniques occur from either solutions or suspensions both aqueous and non-aqueous. Furthermore, all of them occur at moderate temperatures (Nijhuis et al. 2010). Depending on the solution pH, various <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> might be precipitated (Table[*] 1) and, therefore, be deposited as coatings, films and layers. In general, the deposition kinetics depends on the solution supersaturation, concentration of the reagents, temperature, {{presence or absence of}} admixtures, nucleators, inhibitors, etc. As to the precipitation mechanism of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> from aqueous solutions, this process appears to be rather complicated; for the biologically relevant <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> (OCP, CDHA and HA), the crystallization process occurs via formation of one or several intermediate and/or precursor phases, such as ACP, DCPD and/or OCP. The detailed description of the precipitation mechanisms of various <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> {{is beyond the scope of}} current review; the interested readers are referred to the special literature on the topic (Wang and Nancollas 2008; Wang et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in biomineralization have already demonstrated that nanosized particles {{play an important}} role in the formation of hard tissues of animals. Namely, the basic inorganic building blocks of bones and teeth of mammals are nanodimensional and nanocrystalline <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> (in the form of apatites) of a biological origin. In mammals, tens to hundreds nanocrystals of a biological apatite were found to be combined into self-assembled structures under the control of various bioorganic matrixes. In addition, the structures of both dental enamel and bones could be mimicked by an oriented aggregation of nanosized <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates,</b> determined by the biomolecules. The application and prospective use of nanodimensional and nanocrystalline <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> for a clinical repair of damaged bones and teeth are also known. For example, a greater viability and a better proliferation of various types of cells were detected on smaller crystals of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates.</b> Thus, the nanodimensional and nanocrystalline forms of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> have a great potential to revolutionize the field of hard tissue engineering starting from bone repair and augmentation to the controlled drug delivery devices. This paper reviews current state of knowledge and recent developments of this subject starting from the synthesis and characterization to biomedical and clinical applications. More to the point, this review provides possible directions of future research and development...|$|E
30|$|New {{promising}} {{techniques for}} coating medical devices are continuously investigated. Future investigations on various coating processes {{will have to}} include clinical trials to get better understanding of bone responses to coated-implant surfaces, as well as studies on coupling of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, layers and films with drugs, growth factors and cells. Although it has been generally accepted that <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, layers and films improve bone strength and initial osteointegration rate, the optimal coating properties required to achieve maximal bone response are yet to be reported. As such, the use of well-characterized <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, layers and films cell culture studies, animal studies and clinical studies should be well documented to avoid controversial results.|$|R
40|$|In early 1980 s, {{researchers}} discovered self-setting <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> cements, {{which are}} a bioactive and biodegradable grafting material {{in the form of}} a powder and a liquid. Both phases form after mixing a viscous paste that after being implanted, sets and hardens within the body as either a non-stoichiometric calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) or brushite, sometimes blended with unreacted particles and other phases. As both CDHA and brushite are remarkably biocompartible and bioresorbable (therefore, in vivo they can be replaced with newly forming bone), <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> cements represent a good correction technique for non-weight-bearing bone fractures or defects and appear to be very promising materials for bone grafting applications. Besides, these cements possess an excellent osteoconductivity, molding capabilities and easy manipulation. Furthermore, reinforced cement formulations are available, which in a certain sense might be described as <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> concretes. The concepts established by <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> cement pioneers in the early 1980 s were used as a platform to initiate a new generation of bone substitute materials for commercialization. Since then, advances have been made in the composition, performance and manufacturing; several beneficial formulations have already been introduced as a result. Many other compositions are in experimental stages. In this review, an insight into <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> cements and concretes, as excellent biomaterials suitable for both dental and bone grafting application, has been provided...|$|R

40|$|Preparation of {{phosphogypsum}} {{to produce}} the binders requires a much higher input than preparation of natural gypsum stone. This makes it uncompetitive material. The investigations presented therein are meant to reduce this input by looking for the ways of rendering impurities harmless. Soluble acid orthophosphates are the main harmful impurity of phosphogypsum. The studies show that dry insoluble <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> hydrates (1. 09 % and 2. 18 % P 2 O 5 in gypsum) have little effect on W/C, setting times and soundness of Portland cement pastes.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} of biocomposites and hybrid biomaterials {{based on}} <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> that {{are suitable for}} biomedical applications is presented in this review. Since these types of biomaterials offer many significant and exciting possibilities for hard tissue regeneration, this subject belongs to a rapidly expanding area of biomedical research. Through successful combinations of the desired properties of matrix materials with those of fillers (in such systems, <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> might play either role), innovative bone graft biomaterials can be designed. Various types of biocomposites and hybrid biomaterials based on <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates,</b> either those already in use or being investigated for biomedical applications, are extensively discussed. Many different formulations, {{in terms of the}} material constituents, fabrication technologies, structural and bioactive properties as well as both in vitro and in vivo characteristics, have already been proposed.

The specific advantages of using biocomposites and hybrid biomaterials based on <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> in the selected applications are highlighted.

30|$|However, {{application}} of various inter-layers (synonym: buffer layers) {{seems to be}} the most important way to influence the adhesion strength of calcium orthophosphate coatings, films and layers to diverse substrates. A big number of the available deposition techniques (see ‘Preparation’ section above), which should be multiplied to a big selection of various substrates, result in a great number of potentially appropriate chemicals to be used as inter-layers between the substrates and <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates.</b> For example, for plasma-assisted deposition methods of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates,</b> such chemicals as TiO 2 (Rajesh et al. 2011), TiN (Nelea et al. 2000; Yang et al. 2009 b, 2009 c; Man et al. 2009), ZrO 2 (Nelea et al. 2000) or Al 2 O 3 (Nelea et al. 2000), were used as buffer layers. TiO 2 (Nelea et al. 2007; Berezhnaya et al. 2010) and TiN (Nelea et al. 2003) were also used as under-layers for RF magnetron sputtering. Similarly, formation of intermediate layers of titanium hydroxides is required for biomimetic deposition of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> on Ti (Wang et al. 2008 a). To complicate things even further, one should mention, that mutual inter-diffusion of atoms, ions and molecules of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> from coatings, films and layers from one side and those of a substrate from another side might occur. Especially, this is valid for high temperature deposition techniques; however, the mutual inter-diffusion might happen for any technique at the post-deposition annealing stage (see section[*]‘Brief knowledge on the important pre- and post-deposition procedures’). Various atomic mixed inter-layers are formed as the result. For example, the width (measured by Auger electron spectroscopy) of such inter-layer between a HA coating and magnesium substrate formed by IBAD technique was found to be approximately 3 [*]μm (Yang et al. 2008). Such inter-layers can reduce the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients between <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> and substrates, or increase the surface area of the material, wettability or heat conductivity; thus, increasing the bonding strength without affecting biocompatibility. Since the subject of inter-layers appears to be very broad, additional details are not specified further.|$|E
30|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, {{films and}} layers may {{also lead to}} {{increased}} polyethylene wear from the acetabular cup and, thereby, alleviate the problem of osteolysis.|$|R
30|$|A {{study by}} Cairns et al. (2010) should be {{described}} especially. <b>Calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> thin films were deposited onto substrates with varying topography. Then, {{a layer of}} fibronectin was deposited from solution onto each surface, and the response of MG 63 osteoblast-like cells was studied. The results revealed that, in all cases, {{the presence of the}} adsorbed fibronectin layer improved cell adhesion, proliferation and promoted early onset differentiation. Moreover, the nature and scale of the response appeared to be influenced by the surface topography of the substrates. Specifically, cells on the fibronectin-coated <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> thin films with regular topographical features in the nanometer range showed statistically significant differences in focal adhesion assembly, osteocalcin expression and alkaline phosphase activity compared to the <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> films without those topographical features (Cairns et al. 2010). Therefore, both an adsorbed bioorganics and a surface topography of the substrates appear to influence cell adhesion and differentiation.|$|R
3000|$|Nevertheless, {{one must}} stress that {{although}} many experiments concerning the in vivo studies of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers have indicated a stronger and faster fixation, {{as well as}} more bone ingrowth at the interface, the clinical performance of such coatings, films and layers is still far from the perfection. Some of the major concerns associated with the usage of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers in actual body environment, with regard to their long-term stability can be listed as follows (Hulshoff et al. 1996 a; Caulier et al. 1997 a, 1997 b): [...]...|$|R
30|$|Typically, {{during the}} deposition, a target should be rotated {{to achieve a}} stable {{ablation}} rate. As PLD is usually carried out at high substrate temperatures, a thin oxide layer might be formed on the substrate surface prior to the deposition of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> and, thereby, it influences its adherence to the substrate (Nelea et al. 2000). The deposited coatings, layers and films frequently consist of several <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> (often with admixtures of other substances, such as CaO, calcium pyrophosphates, etc.) and might contain both amorphous and crystalline phases (Cleries et al. 2000 a; Koch et al. 1990). Biphasic formulations, such as HA[*]+[*]TTCP (Kim et al. 2005 b), might be deposited as well. Interestingly, TTCP in the coatings was not formed by partial conversion of previously deposited HA. Instead, it was produced by nucleation and growth of TTCP itself from the ablation products of the HA target or by accretion of TTCP grains formed during ablation (Kim et al. 2005 b). Furthermore, the PLD-deposited coatings, films and layers might consist of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> with different morphologies (e.g., granular and columnar), which have different resistance values to delamination (Cleries et al. 2000 a). More to the point, various types of oriented textures might be created as well (Kim et al. 2005 a, 2007 a, 2010). A modification known as ‘transmission laser coating’ has been introduced (Cheng and Ye 2010).|$|E
30|$|In {{electrochemical}} deposition of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates,</b> a supersaturated or a metastable aqueous electrolyte containing calcium and orthophosphate ions is used. Various electrochemical reactions {{occurring in the}} electrolyte near electrodes induce local pH increase, and thus, calcium orthophosphate crystals are nucleated and grow on the electrodes (Manso et al. 2000; Duan et al. 2003; Lu et al. 2005). Obviously, only conductive materials might be coated by this technique. A typical setup includes a platinum electrode (anode) and a metallic implant (cathode) connected to a current generator. Since {{electrochemical deposition}} usually occurs on the negatively charged electrodes, in literature it is {{sometimes referred to as}} cathodic deposition (Zhao et al. 2003; Blackwood and Seah 2009; Roguska et al. 2011). The electrochemical reactions occurring with the ions during the deposition of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> might be found in literature (Kuo and Yen 2002; Yen and Lin 2002).|$|E
30|$|RF {{magnetron}} sputtering might {{be combined with}} other deposition techniques. For example, plasma-assisted RF magnetron co-sputtering deposition method was used to deposit <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> on Ti 6 Al 4 V orthopedic alloy (Xu et al. 2005; Long et al. 2007). Further details on the {{magnetron sputtering}} technique are available in excellent reviews (Surmenev 2012; Shi et al. 2008).|$|E
30|$|According to {{the direct}} laser melting technique, a {{starting}} precursor (<b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate)</b> powder is mixed thoroughly in a water-based organic solvent. Then, the suspension is sprayed onto the substrate surfaces {{to create a}} coating, which is then air dried to remove the moisture, followed by direct laser melting using either continuous wave or pulsed laser beams to produce strong bonds between the <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coating and the substrate (Paital and Dahotre 2007, 2008, 2009 a, 2009 b; Kurella and Dahotre 2006. A schematic setup of a direct laser melting system is available in literature (Paital and Dahotre 2009 a).|$|R
30|$|According to this technique, <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, layers or {{films are}} {{prepared}} by dipping the sample in calcium (usually, nitrate salt) and phosphorus (usually, alkyl phosphates) gels for {{an appropriate time}} at low reaction temperatures. As-formed coatings, layers or films are porous, less dense and have poor adhesion to the substrate. To improve their properties, the samples are annealed at temperatures of 400 °C to 1, 000 °C (Gross et al. 1998 c; Haddow et al. 1999; Montenero et al. 2000; Tkalcec et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2002 b; Metikoš-Huković et al. 2003; Kim et al. 2004 a; Gan and Pilliar 2004; Zhang et al. 2006; Stoica et al. 2008). Depending upon the temperature, different <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> compounds are obtained. The resulting coatings, layers or films can be extremely dense and adhere strongly to the underlying substrate (de Groot et al. 1998). Occasionally, {{in order to improve}} the bond strength between the coating and the substrate, an intervening layer of another compound might be applied prior the sol-gel deposition of a <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> (Kim et al. 2004 b).|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we report}} X-ray {{diffraction}} investigations {{as well as}} Raman and solid-state (31) P and (23) Na magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization of three series of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates.</b> The general formulae of the studied compounds are Ca(10. 5 -x/ 2) M(x) (PO(4)) (7), where M=K or Na and x= 0, 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75, 1. 0; and Ca(10) K(x) Na(1 -x) (PO(4)) (7), where x= 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0.

The unit cell parameters vary continuously with the level of substitution, a characteristic of these solid solutions. The Raman spectra show the different vibrational bands of the phosphate groups PO(4), while the NMR chemical shifts are sensitive to the non-equivalent phosphorus and sodium ions present in these substituted samples. As both Raman and NMR spectroscopies are local probes, they offer tools to distinguish between these different phosphorus and phosphate groups, according to their structural site and local environment, especially the type of cation substituent. A convenient decomposition of the Raman and NMR spectra into Gaussian-Lorentzian components leads us to propose an assignment of the main observed bands of these substituted β-TCPs...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} {{mechanisms of}} phosphate-bearing mineral phases from sewage sludge ash-based fertilizers in soil {{were determined by}} Raman and synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy. Different reaction mechanisms in wet soil were found for calcium and magnesium (pyro-) phosphates. <b>Calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> were converted over time to hydroxyapatite. Conversely, different magnesium phosphates were transformed to trimagnesium phosphate. Since the magnesium phosphates are unable to form an apatite structure, the plant-available phosphorus remains in the soil, leading to better growth results observed in agricultural pot experiments. The pyrophosphates also reacted very differently. Calcium pyrophosphate is unreactive in soil. In contrast, magnesium pyrophosphate quickly formed plant-available dimagnesium phosphate. ...|$|E
30|$|Matrix {{assisted}} {{pulsed laser}} evaporation technique was developed {{as an alternative}} to PLD for delicate and accurate deposition of calcium orthophosphate films, coatings and layers combined with organic and/or biologic materials. The examples include deposition calcium orthophosphate-based biocomposites with sodium maleate (Negroiu et al. 2008), alendronate (Bigi et al. 2009) and silk fibroin (Miroiu et al. 2010). Thermally unstable <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates,</b> such as OCP (Boanini et al. 2012), might be deposited as well. This technique provides a more gentle mechanism for transferring different compounds, including large molecular weight species, and it is expected to ensure an improved stoichiometric transfer, a more accurate thickness control and a higher uniformity of the coatings.|$|E
30|$|In vivo results {{correlate}} {{well with}} the in vitro ones. Osseointegration rates of porous-surfaced Ti 6 Al 4 V implants with control (unmodified sintered coatings) were compared to porous-surfaced implants modified through the addition of either an inorganic or organic route sol-gel-formed <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> films. Implants were placed in distal femoral rabbit condyle sites and, following a 9 -day healing period, implant fixation strength was evaluated using a pullout test. Both types of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> films significantly enhanced the early rate of bone in-growth and fixation as evidenced by higher pullout force and interface stiffness compared with controls. However, {{there was no significant}} difference between calcium orthophosphate-coated implants prepared using the two different methods (Gan et al. 2004).|$|R
30|$|The {{interactions}} of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers with either cells in vitro or surrounding tissues in vivo {{have been studied}} a lot (Huang et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2004; Choi et al. 2003; Ueda et al. 2007; Massaro et al. 2001; Wie et al. 1998; Maistrelli et al. 1993; Hulshoff et al. 1996 a; Caulier et al. 1997 a, 1997 b; Antonov et al. 1998; Cleries et al. 2000 c; Lo et al. 2000; Jung et al. 2001; Manso et al. 2002 c; Heimann et al. 2004; Siebers et al. 2004, 2005; Manders et al. 2006; Simank et al. 2006; Mello et al. 2007; Hashimoto et al. 2008; Coelho and Lemons 2009; Sima et al. 2010; Quaranta et al. 2010; Cairns et al. 2010). The in vitro trials using different cell lines revealed that {{in the vast majority}} of the cases, <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers enhanced cellular adhesion, proliferation and differentiation, while the results of the in vivo studies revealed that they promoted bone regeneration. For example, a combination of surface geometry and <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings was found to benefit the implant-bone response during the healing phase (Hayakawa et al. 2002). <b>Calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings on titanium implants followed by bisphosphonate-immobilization appeared to be effective in the promotion of osteogenesis on surfaces of dental implants (Yoshinari et al. 2002). A greater percent of bone contact lengths were detected for calcium orthophosphate-coated Ti implants compared with control Ti implants 3 and 12 [*]weeks after implant placement (Ong et al. 2002). Similar results were obtained in other studies (Dalton and Cook 1995; Nguyen et al. 2004; Yan et al. 2006).|$|R
30|$|To {{conclude}} this section, {{one must}} note the following: Even though {{the importance and}} the need for development of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers have been recognized, it is still mostly being explored on research level, and after extensive search of open literature, these coatings appear to have made limited headway into commercialization. In spite of mention of the commercial products such as hip and dental implants produced by Zimmer Orthopedics (Freiburg, Germany), Smith and Nephew (Memphis, TN, USA), and Biomet, the science and technology related to their manufacturing is not disclosed by any one of them due to the proprietary reasons. Hence, at this point it is difficult to bring a detailed discussion on commercialization of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers (Paital and Dahotre 2009 a).|$|R
30|$|Spin coating is a {{procedure}} used to apply uniform thin films to flat substrates. It is rather similar to dip coating. The coating process {{consists of four}} stages: deposition, spin up, spin off and evaporation. In this process, a sample is dipped in a solution or suspension and then withdrawn at a constant speed, usually {{with the help of}} a motor. Rotational draining and solvent evaporation result in the deposition of a coating, film or layer. A machine used for spin coating is called a spin coater, or simply spinner (Mennicke and Salditt 2002). Just a few publications on spin coating of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> were published (You et al. 2005; Yuan et al. 2009; Carradò and Viart 2010).|$|E
30|$|In general, calcium {{orthophosphate}} coatings, layers or films {{obtained by}} the electrochemical method have a uniform structure since they are formed gradually through a nucleation and growth process at relatively low temperatures (de Groot et al. 1998). Such coatings might be porous (Duan et al. 2003). Interestingly, {{that in order to}} produce apatite coatings, non-apatitic <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> might be electrochemically deposited, followed by additional treatments (Redepenning et al. 1996; Han et al. 1999 b, 2001; Kumar et al. 1999; Silva et al. 2001). Subsequently, the deposited calcium orthophosphate coatings, layers or films might be heat treated in water steam at 125 °C (Shirkhanzadeh 1993) and/or then calcined at temperatures up to 800 °C to densify and improve its bonding to the substrates.|$|E
40|$|Activation of {{orthophosphates}} of {{the type}} ABPO 4 with copper gives an efficient phosphor in some cases. The brightest phosphors found are SrLiPO,-Cu and BaLiPO,-Cu, with an emission peak (with 2537 A excitation) at 4150 and 4600 A, respectively. The properties of orthophosphates {{of the type}} ABPO, with two kinds of alkali earth or alkali metal ions, respectively, were also studied. X-ray diagrams of the compounds investigated are given.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are cases}} (Gineste et al. 1999; de Bruijn et al. 1994; Cleries et al. 2000 b), in which the {{biodegradation}} kinetics of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers appeared to be correlated imperfectly with their solubility values (see Table[*] 1). For example, three types of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> (HA, ACP and β-TCP) coatings on titanium alloy substrates, deposited by the laser ablation technique, were immersed in SBF {{in order to determine}} their behavior in conditions similar to the human blood plasma. Neither HA nor ACP coatings were found to dissolve in SBF, while a β-TCP coating slightly dissolved. Precipitation of an apatitic phase was favored onto both HA and β-TCP coatings; however, no precipitation occurred onto ACP coating (Cleries et al. 2000 b). Additionally, degradation rates of dental implants with 50 - and 100 -micron thick coatings of HA, FA and fluorhydroxylapatite (FHA) were studied (Gineste et al. 1999). The implants were inserted in dog jaws and retrieved for histological analysis after 3, 6, and 12 [*]months. The thickness of the <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings was evaluated using an image analysis device. HA and FA coatings (even at 100 -micron thickness) were almost totally degraded within the implantation period. In contrast, the FHA coatings did not show significant degradation during the same period (Gineste et al. 1999).|$|R
30|$|<b>Calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> {{coatings}} {{of various}} thickness ranging from 170 [*]nm up to 1.5 [*]μm were obtained {{depending upon the}} deposition times (Fernandez-Pradas et al. 2001). The coating morphology {{was found to be}} grain-like particles and droplets. During growth, the grain-like particles grew in size, partially masking the droplets, and a columnar structure was developed. The thinnest (170 [*]nm) coating consisted mainly of ACP. The coating of approximately 350 -nm thick also contained HA, whereas even thicker coatings contained some α-TCP in addition to HA. All coatings failed under the scratch test by spalling from the diamond tip; however, the failure load increased as thickness decreased until only plastic deformation and cohesive failure for the thinnest coating was observed (Fernandez-Pradas et al. 2001). Therefore, both the structure and the phase composition of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers might depend on their thickness.|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} ceramics {{are widely}} used as coating materials to orthopedic implants and are found to enhance initial bony ingrowth by stimulating osseous apposition to the implant surface. In this study, two novel <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> materials were selected for coating onto the commonly used orthopedic implant material Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. One was <b>calcium</b> alkali <b>orthophosphate</b> with the crystalline phase Ca 10 [K/Na](PO 4) 7 with a small addition of SiO 2 (AW-Si) {{and the other was}} <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> composed of 70 mol % fluorapatite, Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 F 2 and 30 mol % CaZr 4 (PO 4) 6 (FA 7 Z). The coated implants were placed in cortical and cortico-cancellous bone of sheep femur for six weeks. Retrieved samples were tested for osseointegration and mechanical strength. It was found that both coatings produced enhanced bone/implant contact rate compared to the control when implanted in cortico-cancellous bone.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphates}} are key {{materials to}} sustain life on Earth as constituent of the gravity-defying bony skeletons of all vertebrates {{as well as}} the dentine and enamel materials of teeth. This book contains accounts on the historical development of the scientific knowledge gained on <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates,</b> the latest information on the structure of carbonate-bearing hydroxyapatite, the role played by small amounts of molecular water residing in synthetic hydroxyapatite and bone mineral, {{as well as the}} nature of oxyhydroxyapatite and oxyapatite as intermediates during dehydroxylation of hydroxyapatite, pertinent information to unravel the complex processes relevant for plasma-sprayed calcium phosphate coatings on endoprosthetic implants. This book is recommended to industrial and academic professionals in the fields of medical technology, orthopedy, dentistry, biology, materials science, chemistry, environmental engineering, and mineralogy...|$|E
30|$|By {{means of}} a MAO technique, calcium {{orthophosphate}} coatings, films and layers have been prepared on various metals (Song et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2005; Sun et al. 2007; Wei et al. 2007; Han et al. 2008). For example, MAO was performed on titanium in an electrolyte containing calcium glycerophosphate and calcium acetate using a direct current power supply. The MAO technique appeared to be suitable to form porous and rough ceramic coatings containing Ca and P. Then, the coatings were hydrothermally treated in aqueous solutions with pH within 7.0 to 11.0 (adjusted by adding NaOH) at 190 °C for 10 [*]h in an autoclave. This procedure converted undisclosed <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> into CDHA and/or HA crystals, while the amount of precipitated HA increased with solution pH increasing (Liu et al. 2005).|$|E
30|$|Depending on {{the type}} of {{sputtering}} system and parameters used for the deposition, the structure and chemical composition of the deposited coatings, layers and films may be quite {{different from those of the}} initial material used for sputtering. For example, differences in Ca/P ratios between the initial <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphates</b> and that in the sputtered coatings were suggested to be attributed to the preferential sputtering of calcium, probably due to a possibility of orthophosphate ions being pumped away before they are deposited at the substrate (Zalm 1989). It was also suggested that orthophosphate ions might be weakly bound to the growing coatings, layers and films, and therefore, they are sputtered away by incoming ions or electrons (van Dijk et al. 1996). Nevertheless, all sputtering techniques have the advantage of depositing thin coatings, films and layers with strong adhesion and compact microstructure.|$|E
3000|$|In {{spite of}} the long history and the {{aforementioned}} achievements, still not all concerns on the surgical applications of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers have been eliminated. Still, {{a limited amount of}} the in vivo studies is available in the literature. The limitations to such experiments may be attributed to any of the following reasons: [...]...|$|R
30|$|A {{potential}} drawback of {{the majority}} of the deposition techniques of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers is their relatively high cost for a large scale production. Therefore, to decrease processing time and make their manufacturing commercially viable, it is desirable to process the thinnest coating that would significantly increase the biological response (Coelho et al. 2009 c). Much attention should be paid to functionally graded structures with an amorphous top layer and a crystalline layer underneath (Wang and Zreiqat 2010). This allows adjusting the coating resorption rates to the values at which new bone grows at early stages when it is of the most importance for the bone mineralization process. Furthermore, therapeutic capabilities of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers as templates for the in situ delivery of drugs and osteoinductive agents (peptides, hormones and growth factors) at the required times should be elucidated much better.|$|R
30|$|Specifically, the {{adhesion}} {{forces of}} <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers should be {{high enough to}} maintain their bioactivity after a surgical implantation. Generally, tensile adhesion testing according to standards ASTM C 633 (ASTM C 633 2008) and ASTM F- 1147 - 05 (2011) {{is the most common}} procedure to determine the quantitative adhesion values to the underlying substrates. Furthermore, fatigue (Surmenev 2012; Mukherjee et al. 2000), scratch (Cheng et al. 2009; Hamdi et al. 2010) and pullout (Cheng et al. 2009) testing, as well as wear resistance (Hamdi et al. 2010), are among the most valuable techniques to provide additional information on the mechanical behavior of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers. Changes in the surface topography can give an indication of wear resistance. For example, coatings with good adherence to the substrate have shown less alteration of its surface roughness, while the study on the different parameters revealed that deposition time was the most influential factor in the wear behavior (Hamdi et al. 2010). The latter was attributed to its correlation with coating thickness. The scratch test is performed with reference to ISO 20502 : 2005 (ISO 20502 2005). The load at which complete removal of the coating occurs is usually taken as an indication of the adhesion strength. Further details on the mechanical testing methods of <b>calcium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> coatings, films and layers might be found in literature (Ben-Nissan et al. 2011).|$|R
