40|$|Bioelectrical {{impedance}} {{measurements are}} widely used {{for the study of}} body composition. Commonly measurements are made at 50 kHz to estimate total body water or at low frequencies (< 10 kHz) to estimate extracellular fluid volume. These measurements can be obtained as single measurements at discrete frequencies, or as fitted data interpolated from plots of measurements made at multiple frequencies. This study compared single frequency and multiple frequency (MF) measurements taken in the intensive care environment. MF bioimpedance (4 - 1000 kHz) was measured on an adult with and without <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and on babies in the neonatal intensive care unit. Measurements obtained at individual frequencies were plotted against frequency and examined for the presence of outlying points. Fitted data for measurements obtained at 5 kHz and 50 kHz with and without <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitoring</b> were compared. Significant artefacts were detected in measurements at approximately 50 kHz and at integral divisions of this frequency as a result of interference from <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitors.</b> Single frequency measurements taken at these frequencies may be subject to errors that would be difficult to detect without the aid of information obtained from MF measurements...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} safety and cost effectiveness of an institutional policy on discharge of preterm infants with Apnea of Prematurity (AOP) from the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center Newborn Intensive Care Unit (VCUNC NICU) with caffeine therapy and a <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitor.</b> This practice policy was developed {{over a decade ago}} as a cost containment measure in neonatal care and continues to be implemented today despite the lack of a formal evaluation. The secondary objective was to examine through {{a review of the literature}} the psychosocial impact of premature birth on the family and the potential effect on the infant 2 ̆ 7 s hospital discharge. The evaluation of this policy is based on the conceptual framework of effectiveness, efficiency, and equity in health care. Results were used to generate policy recommendations. This is a retrospective case study of 933 infants admitted to the VCU Medical Center and the community hospital NICU between 1993 and 2002 diagnosed with Apnea of Prematurity. Data was obtained from the Neonatal Information System database at Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS), the Virginia Department of Health, and the VCUHS hospital information system. In this mixed methods study, the infants were divided into two groups: 1) those discharged from the hospital on caffeine citrate therapy, and a <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitor</b> for continued management of apnea; and 2) those that were hospitalized until resolution of apnea. Data was analyzed for differences in mortality and morbidity, hospital readmissions and cost of hospital care from birth to 1 year of age. Interviews were conducted with NICU clinicians to obtain a qualitative perspective on this policy. No significant differences were found in the mortality rate between the two groups (p=. 65), and the causes of the four deaths were unrelated to Apnea of Prematurity. Mean hospital costs were approximately 58, 000 in both groups. Bronchiolitis was the leading cause for hospital readmission and there was no difference in the rate of hospital readmissions. Based on interviews with NICU clinicians, the policy works well and early discharge is advantageous to the infant and family. Therefore, we find no reason to not continue this policy. Study results support the importance and direction for further research on early discharge of infants with AOP and enhanced epidemiologic surveillance of this population...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{starts in}} Chapter 1 with general aspects of {{prematurity}} {{and its consequences}} on the respiratory system. Thereby, common types of respiratory failure in preterm infants, the physiology of respiratory muscles and different cardiorespiratory monitoring techniques used in the neonatal intensive care unit are described. The aim of this thesis is to explore if transcutaneous electromyography of the diaphragm (dEMG) {{can be used as}} a novel cardiorespiratory monitoring technique for preterm infants. Chapter 2 consists of a prospective cohort study in which the feasibility of dEMG as a <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitor</b> for preterm infants with a gestational age less than 32 weeks is determined and compared to chest impedance. In Chapter 3, a case report illustrates if transcutaneous dEMG can be used to detect a hemidiaphragmatic paresis in a preterm infant. Chapter 4 describes the effect of a loading dose of caffeine on the electrical activity of the diaphragm, tidal volume and endexpiratory lung volume in preterm infants by measuring dEMG and respiratory inductance plethysmography after caffeine administration. In Chapter 5, the effect of weaning from nasal continuous positive airway pressure to low flow nasal cannula on diaphragmatic activity is described. In Chapter 6, we determined if dEMG is able to classify apnea of prematurity correctly into central, obstructive or mixed when compared to chest impedance. Finally, Chapter 7 and 8 provides a, respectively, English and Dutch summary of this thesis and the most important results are discussed and future perspectives are outlined...|$|E

All infants were singletons. Recommendations during the study period (1992 - 1994) were for daily use for 23 hours per day. Measurements were average daily hours of use and consistency of use (daily or variable). Gestational age, maternal age, and socioeconomic status as measured by receipt of public assistance were also recorded.  RESULTS—Siblings of SIDS were monitored for fewer hours than were premature or ALTE infants. Only 54 % of sibings of SIDS were monitored daily, compared to 87 % of premature infants and 93 % of ALTEs. Within each diagnostic category socioeconomic status did not affect average hours of monitoring. Consistency of use was more evident in those with private insurance, although the trend did not reach significance.  CONCLUSIONS—Parents of infants with apnoea of prematurity or ALTE are highly compliant with <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitoring</b> recommendations in the first month of monitor usage.

Lately its use has been extended to perform flexible bronchoscopy (FB). In an infant under mechanical ventilation (MV), most of FB require an endotracheal tube # 4. 5 because the smallest instrument with a suction channel has a 3. 5 mm diameter. Our objective was to evaluate the use of LM while performing FB in patients on MV.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundOver 50 % of {{patients}} with chronic heart failure (CHF) have sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). Any variation {{in the type of}} SDB in CHF will have implications for patient management. Currently there is good evidence for treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in CHF with continuous positive airway pressure; however, for central sleep apnea (CSA) the treatment is less clear. AimsThe aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the variation in the severity and type of SDB (OSA vs. CSA) throughout 4 consecutive nights in CHF patients with SDB. MethodsNineteen male CHF patients (mean±sd: age 61 ± 9 years; left ventricular ejection fraction: 34 ± 10 % and percent predicted peak VO 2 : 67 ± 19 %) underwent <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitoring</b> in their own home throughout 4 consecutive nights. ResultsThere was minimal variation in apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) throughout 4 nights in CHF patients with SDB [intraclass correlation coefficient (95 % confidence interval (CI)) : 0. 97 (95 % CI 0. 76 and 0. 97) ]. Eight patients [42 % (95 % CI 20 % and 64 %) ] demonstrated a shift in the type of their SDB, from CSA to OSA or vice versa; these patients had significantly smaller neck circumference (group mean±sd) 42 ± 2 vs. 44 ± 2 cm; p= 0. 04), and had significant variation in the central AHI [intraclass correlation coefficient: 0. 51 (95 % CI 0. 16 and 0. 85) ].

Significant intra-cranial head trauma from a fall or birth injury is not common in the immediate newborn period. Furthermore, intracranial bleeding requiring surgical intervention is exceedingly rare. We present an unusual case of an in-hospital fall {{in the delivery room}} requiring neurosurgical intervention. Case Report: A term infant, appropriate for gestational age, delivered precipitously from a maternal standing position. The vertex neonate struck the linoleum floor after an approximate 80 -cm fall, landing headfirst. The physical and neurological exams were initially normal, and skull films did not demonstrate an obvious fracture. The baby was closely observed, undergoing continuous <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitoring.</b> After the patient had an episode of apnea, a scalp hematoma was noted.

All infants underwent a cardiorespiratory recording with simultaneous 24 -hour pH-monitoring. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the severity of GERD: A. Reflux Index (RI) 7 %. Monthly evaluations were performed and the anti-reflux therapy was maintained till normalization of monitoring and clinic. Results: 41 infants were enrolled. GERD was found in 80 % of patients (moderate in 54 %, severe in 27 %). A normalization of the cardiorespiratory tracks was recorded on average after 1 month for group A, 7 months for the group B and 9. 5 months for group C. A significant difference was registered between group A and both group B and C (P < 0. 0001), as well as between the group B and C (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: GERD influences significantly the time of normalization of the <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitoring</b> in infants with ALTE. GERD diagnosis and treatment are mandatory in these patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sleep-disordered {{breathing}} (SDB), especially obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA), has frequent complications include hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance based on abdominal obesity or excess visceral fat (called Syndrome Z). OSA is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The clinical characteristics of Japanese OSA subjects with OSA remain unclear. The present study investigated prevalence and predictive factors of intracoronary stenosis detected by multislice computed tomography (MSCT) in Japanese male subjects with SDB/OSA. Findings The study (O-VFStudy) subjects were 39 Japanese men with SDB/OSA who underwent all-night <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitoring</b> with fully attended polysomnography, and moreover both fat computed tomography (CT) scan and 64 -row MSCT coronary angiography. The prevalence of coronary stenosis in this selected population with SDB/OSA was 15 %. Logistic regression analysis showed {{a significant relationship between}} age-adjusted CAD and metabolic syndrome (p p = 0. 033), and lower levels of serum adiponectin (4. 5 ± 0. 6 versus 6. 4 ± 0. 6 μg/mL, p = 0. 014), compared with groups without the metabolic syndrome. Conclusions The present study describes that the prevalence of greater than 50 % intracoronary stenotic lesions detected by MSCT was 15 % and the metabolic syndrome was correlated with intracoronary stenosis detected by MSCT in Japanese SDB/OSA subjects.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} severe alarms on home-documented monitoring {{in infants}} born prematurely. METHODS: In infants born at a post-menstrual age (PMA) less than 35 weeks, a polysomnography was performed before discharge. A heart rate less than 50 {{beats per minute}} (bpm) for more than 3 seconds or an apnea lasting for more than 15 seconds with a heart rate less than 60 bpm were defined as abnormal. These babies were given <b>cardiorespiratory</b> home <b>monitoring</b> with memory. Serious alarms on the home monitor were defined as heart rate less than 50 bpm for more than 3 seconds. RESULTS: Of 1058 infants, 96 infants needed <b>cardiorespiratory</b> home <b>monitoring.</b> Sixty-one infants showed alarms at home. The mean post-conceptional age (PCA) when alarms stopped was 46 weeks. Seventeen patients had serious alarms above the PCA of 50 weeks. There was a significant negative correlation (r = - 0. 46 and p = 0. 0002 by Spearman's rank correlation) between the PMA at birth and the PCA at which the last alarm was noted CONCLUSION: Prematurely born infants with an abnormal polysomnography at discharge {{are at high risk}} for developing acute events at home. A younger PMA at birth correlates with a higher risk of alarms at a later PCA. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Bioelectrical {{impedance}} analysis may {{be useful}} for cot-side monitoring of fluid balance in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However the presence of cardio-respiratory monitoring equipment, non-ideal electrode placement and inability to obtain accurate crown-heel measurements may interfere {{with the ability to}} obtain reliable impedance data in this setting. This study aimed to investigate the effects of these factors on impedance analysis and to develop a prediction equation for extracellular fluid volume in the neonate. The study found that <b>cardiorespiratory</b> <b>monitoring</b> had no significant effect on multi-frequency impedance measurements. Placement of current delivering electrodes on the ventral rather than dorsal surfaces improved separation of current and voltage electrodes but did not alter impedance results. Contralateral measurements were not significantly different to ipsilateral measurements. In 24 infants, extracellular fluid volume was measured using corrected bromide space (CBS) and simultaneous impedance analysis was performed. There was good correlation between CBS and the impedance quotient F- 2 /R- 0 where F is foot length and R- 0 is resistance at zero frequency. The study concludes that despite many potential difficulties associated with impedance analysis in the NICU, reliable measurements of impedance can be obtained and further work to validate prediction equations for ECF is warranted...|$|R
