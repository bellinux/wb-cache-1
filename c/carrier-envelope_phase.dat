The <b>carrier-envelope</b> <b>phase</b> of femtosecond optical pulses becomes important {{when they are}} used to probe attosecond physics. We demonstrate that long-term <b>carrier-envelope</b> <b>phase</b> stability is possible to achieve. Using phase-stable lasers it is possible to combine the output of different lasers phase coherently. It is also possible to load them phase coherently into a cavity, yielding the prospect of high-intensity experiments without an amplifier. Finally, we present quantum interference control of injected currents in semiconductors, which provides a solid-state phase detector of the <b>carrier-envelope</b> <b>phase.</b> All current techniques for accessing attosecond time scales rely on processes that are sensitive to the electric field of femtosecond pulses. Control of the electric field at an attosecond level requires control of the phase of the femtosecond pulse, specifically the phase of the carrier wave with respect to the envelope, which is known as the <b>carrier-envelope</b> <b>phase</b> CE.

First, we observe D 2 + wave packets {{up to the first}} half revival without a control pulse. Next, we apply the control pulse to split the wave packet when the wave packet is near the outer turning point. We observe that one piece remains in the bound state and the other propagates to the dissociation continuum. By varying the delay between the pump and control pulses, we control the branching ratios. By a quantum mechanical calculation, we also show that if <b>carrier-envelope</b> <b>phases</b> of subvibrational period pulses are controlled, it can break left-right symmetry during dissociation, freezing the electron on one of the two dissociating fragments during dissociation.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of PhysicsItzik Ben-ItzhakOne {{ultimate}} goal of ultrafast, strong- field laser science is to coherently control chemical reactions. Present laser technology allows {{for the production of}} intense (> 10 [superscript] 13 W/cm[superscript] 2), ultrashort (5 fs), carrier-envelope phase-stabilized pulses. By knowing the electric field waveform, sub-cycle resolution on the order of 100 's of attoseconds (1 as= 10 [superscript]- 18 s) can be reached [...] the timescale for electron motion. Meanwhile, the laser field strengths are comparable to that which binds electrons to atoms or molecules. In this intense-field ultrashort-pulse regime one can both measure and manipulate dynamics of strong-field, quantum-mechanical processes in atoms and molecules. Despite much progress in the technology, typical durations for which lasers can be reliably locked to a specific <b>carrier-envelope</b> <b>phase</b> ranges from a few minutes to a few hours. Experiments investigating <b>carrier-envelope</b> <b>phase</b> effects that have necessarily long data acquisition times, such as those requiring coincidence between fragments originating from the same atom or molecule, are thus challenging and uncommon. Therefore, we combined the new technology for measuring the <b>carrier-envelope</b> <b>phase</b> of each and every laser shot with other single-shot coincidence three-dimensional momentum imaging techniques to alleviate the need for <b>carrier-envelope</b> <b>phase</b> stabilized laser pulses. Using phase-tagged coincidence techniques, several targets and laser-induced processes were studied. One particular highlight uses this method to study the recollision process of non-sequential double ionization of argon. By measuring the momentum of the two electrons emitted in the process, we could study their energy sharing. Furthermore, by selecting certain <b>carrier-envelope</b> <b>phase</b> values, and therefore laser pulses with a particular waveform, events with single recollision could be isolated and further analyzed.
