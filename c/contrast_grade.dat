40|$|To {{assess the}} utility of transesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TEE) precardioversion (CV) of atrial fibrillation (AF) {{as a predictor of}} unsuccessful CV (no reversion or recurrence < 24 h.), 68 patients with AF and atrial flutter (8) were studied. Mean aged was 61 ± 9 years. TEE was performed before CV Left atrial (LA) and left atrial appendage (LAA) size, spontaneous echo contrast (SCE) grade (from 0 to 3) and mechanical function were evaluated. We measured LAA emptying velocities (+) and total wave velocity (T = emptying + filling waves). LAA flow was classified in 6 patterns (IA, IB, II, IIIA, IIIB, IV) : detected in sinus rhythm II), flutter (II). AF (III). and no identifiable flow waves (IV). The patterns IB, IIIB, and IV represented LAA mechanical disfunction, and were defined by an emptying wave less than 20 cm/sec. Results 14 patients had recurrent AF 24 h. after CV. The remaining patients were in sinus rhythm. There were no differences between both groups with regard to aged, mitral stenosis prevalence, functional class, atrial flutter, LA size and LAA dimension and history of embolization.

40|$|Background. Coronary patency {{has been}} used as a measure of {{thrombolysis}} success after acute myocardial infarction. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) Study Group perfusion grades have gained wide acceptance, with grades 0 (no distal flow) and 1 perfusion (minimal flow) being designated as thrombolysis failures and grades 2 (partial perfusion) and 3 (complete perfusion) as thrombolysis successes. However, the significance of the individual TIMI grades on clinical outcome has not been adequately assessed. Methods and Results. To evaluate the functional significance of TIMI perfusion grades, we compared 1 -day coronary patency status with ventriculographic, enzymatic, and ECG indexes of acute myocardial infarction in 298 patients treated with anistreplase or alteplase within 4 hours of myocardial infarction symptom onset. Radionuclide ejection fraction was determined at 1 week and at 1 month. Perfusion grades for the entire study population were distributed as 12 % (n= 37) grades 0 / 1, 13 % (n= 40) grade 2, and 74 % (n= 221) grade 3. Patency profile did not differ between the two thrombolytic regimens. Further coronary interventions were performed after the 1 -day patency determination in 43 % of patients (43 %, 48 %, 42 %, respectively, in grades 0 / 1, 2, and 3 patients).

Sixty-nine patients (33 %) were transplanted between 1990 and 1999, 58 (27 %) between 2000 and 2005, and 84 (40 %) between 2005 and 2008. A matched family donor was employed in 138 patients (65 %) and an unrelated donor in 73 (35 %). The 10 -year probability of overall and disease-free survival was 63. 4 % and 61 %, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{research}} alternative conceptions that grades 11 and 12 high school physical science learners have about projectile motion. Their performance is compared with first year university physics students. A questionnaire was designed for grade 11 and 12 learners. The understanding of university students was assessed through ex post facto scrutiny of responses to a projectile question set in their mid-year examination. The {{results of this study}} were analyzed through the responses of the learners and university students. The study revealed that the grade 11 learners performed better than their grade 12 counterparts, though the same questionnaire was used for both groups. Such differences may be associated with the fact that projectile motion is taught during the grade 11 year of study. Grade 11 learners may therefore have a better memory recall of the formal teaching of the topic and associated concepts. By <b>contrast,</b> <b>grade</b> 12 learners might have resorted to a “re-understanding” of the various concepts as they have been acquired in their own world: these are what the literature refers to as, inter alia, alternative conceptions or naïve ideas.

This may be due to a maturity factor, as well as the way in which projectile motion was dealt with in their lectures. Arising out of our analysis, we shall make a number of recommendations as to how the topic might be better taught at the secondary level.

40|$|Background: Resolution of left atrial {{thrombus}} after long-term oral anticoagulation enhances safe percutaneous transvenous mi-tral commissurotomy (PTMC); {{however, the}} short-term benefit {{has not been}} defined. Objectives: To estimate the resolution rate of left atrial throm-bus among PTMC candidates after 6 months of oral anticoagula-tion and to determine its main predictors. Design: Prospective cohort. Setting: Community-based university medical center. Patients: 219 PTMC candidates with thrombus demonstrated by multiplane transesophageal echocardiographic studies. Measurements: The primary outcome was {{the status of the}} thrombus at the first 6 -month follow-up; secondary measures were bleeding or thromboembolic complications. Results: Among 219 PTMC candidates with left atrial thrombus (mean age [±SD], 39. 6 ± 7. 4 years [range, 19 to 62 years]), com-plete resolution of thrombus, with an overall disappearance rate of 24. 2 % (95 % CI, 18. 5 % to 29. 9 %), was demonstrated in 53 patients who subsequently underwent successful PTMC. In an-other 166 patients, the thrombus size was reduced by 24 % (P < 0. 001). No thrombus resolution was observed in the 27 patients with a left atrial body thrombus. Eighteen patients had minor bleeding. The significant predictors of thrombus resolution were a New York Heart Association class of 2 or less, a left atrial ap-pendage thrombus size of 1. 6 cm 2 or less, a left atrial spontane-ous echocardiographic <b>contrast</b> <b>grade</b> of 1 or less, and an inter-national normalized ratio (INR) of at least 2. 5.

40|$|Background: Intrapulmonary {{vascular}} dilatations (IVD) are microvascular pulmonary changes {{mediated by}} nitric oxide that cause right-to-left shunt and hypoxemia. Contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography (cTTE) is {{the gold standard}} diagnostic test for IVD. Objective: To evaluate contrast-enhanced transesophageal echocardiography (cTEE) in the diagnosis and grading of IVD. Methods: A study group (SG) of 63 cirrhotic patients were compared to 20 shunt-free control subjects (CG). Both groups underwent cTEE and cTTE using intravenous injections of agitated saline solution for contrast tests. Patients with patent foramen ovale, when detected, were excluded. Late appearance of microbubbles in the left atrium was diagnostic of pulmonary shunt (positive contrast test) and was graded as trivial, mild, moderate or severe by cTEE. Contrast tests were negative in 7 patients (35 %) and trivial in the remaining 13 (65 %) in CG, so only contrast grades >= mild {{were considered to be}} positive IVD tests in the SG. Gasometric change was expressed as the alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference (A-aO(2) D) and was considered abnormally high at values > 20 mmHg. Results: SG: positive IVD tests were present in 23 patients (36 %) by cTTE and 47 (75 %) by cTEE (P < 0. 001). These patients showed A-aO(2) D values significantly higher than those with negative IVD tests (P < 0. 02) and were directly proportional to the <b>contrast</b> <b>grade.</b> cTEE allowed the diagnosis of IVD in three additional patients with high A-aO(2) D that were not detected by cTTE.

HEC- 1 A endometrial cancer cells transfected with S 100 A 4 siRNA had undetectable S 100 A 4 protein, decreased migration and invasion. The mechanism of S 100 A 4 upregulation in endometrial cancer remains unclear. Methylation of the S 100 A 4 gene was detected in benign endometrial glands and grade 1 tumors with no S 100 A 4 expression. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>grade</b> 3 endometrioid tumors with high S 100 A 4 expression showed no methylation of the gene. 5 -Aza- 22 ̆ 7 -deoxycytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, induced the expression of S 100 A 4 in the less invasive EC cell line, KLE, in which the S 100 A 4 gene is hypermethylated and minimally expressed. S 100 A 4 was induced during TGF-β 1 -triggered cell scattering in HEC- 1 A cells, in which S 100 A 4 was demethylated. Transfection of HEC- 1 A cells with S 100 A 4 siRNA significantly reduced the effect of TGF-β 1 on basal migration and invasion. Our preliminary data suggested that this upregulation was mediated by the transcription factor Snail. One Snail binding consensus site was found in the region where DNA methylation was closely correlated with S 100 A 4 gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the binding of Snail to this consensus site in HEC- 1 A cells. In SPEC 2 endometrial cancer cells, loss of Snail leads to repressed S 100 A 4 gene expression. Similar to S 100 A 4, Snail was overexpressed in aggressive endometrial tumors. Our study suggested that the S 100 A 4 gene was demethylated and further upregulated by the TGF-β 1 and Snail pathway in invasive endometrial cancer. S 100 A 4 could potentially serve as a good molecular marker for invasiveness and a target for therapeutic intervention for advanced endometrial cancer. ...|$|E

40|$|The current {{dissertation}} project {{examined the}} influence of orthographic experiences {{on the development of}} the functional phonological unit in spoken word production in native Mandarin-speaking children. Functional phonological unit refers to the first selectable phonological unit after lexical selection in the planning of spoken word production. Previous research has shown that the acquisition of orthographic knowledge restructures literate speakers’ phonological representation and in particular, the acquisition of alphabetic orthographic knowledge improves children’s phonological awareness at the phonemic level. However, few studies have investigated {{the influence of}} orthographic experiences on phonological retrieval and encoding in spoken word production. The goal of this dissertation is to fill this gap. Four experiments were carried out to conduct the investigation. Participants consisted of native Mandarin speakers from four age groups with different orthographic experiences, including 1) Grade 1 children, who were comparatively more exposed to alphabetic Pinyin and had very limited Chinese character knowledge, 2) Grade 2 and Grade 4 children, who had better character knowledge and more exposure to characters, and 3) adult readers, who had the highest level of character knowledge and the most exposure to characters. Experiment 1 investigated whether the onset served as the functional phonological unit in producing monosyllables; Experiment 2 investigated whether the role of the onset in phonological retrieval and encoding was sustained when producing disyllabic words; Experiment 3 examined the role of the syllable segment (i. e., a syllable whose tone is indeterminate or an atonal syllable) in producing disyllabic words; Experiment 4 examined the role of the tonal syllable (i. e., tonal information is also included) in producing disyllabic words. Results showed that only Grade 1 children selected the onset as the functional phonological unit regardless of the word length during spoken word production and that additionally, they might process the rime segment and tone as a cohesive unit. By <b>contrast,</b> <b>Grade</b> 4 children and adults selected the syllable segment as the functional phonological unit.

The aforementioned findings help us better understand the mechanism of phonological processing, and as a result, may help educators develop more efficient pedagogical approaches to improve children’s phonological processing ability...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} has explored {{the possibility of}} determining the optimum black and white photographic print characteristics for paper surface, image color, and contrast to achieve optimum reproduction from that original for a given set of printing press conditions utilizing single impression offset lithography. A random population of 101 observers evaluated the reproduction of eighteen different photographic prints of the same subject from the identical film negative. The prints varied in contrast grades from grade one to grade three; in image color from warm black to neutral black to cool black; in surface characteristics from glossy to semi-lustre to matte; and surface finishes of smooth and textured. The reproductions studied were produced after a tone reproduction analysis was conducted to determine the printing press characteristics. To reduce variablity the same press, paper, inks, and plates were used for all the press tests. The film negatives were generated by scanning each of the eighteen original photographic prints on the state-of-the-art Crosfield Magnascan 640 utilizing a predetermined program derived from the initial press and tone reproduction data. The observers were asked to choose what they {{believed to be the}} best three reproductions and the three most inferior reproductions. To analyze the characteristics which contributed to the findings of certain reproductions being selected superior to others a correlation analysis was performed. With this information, the paper characteristics which yielded the optimum reproduction was determined. These characteristics are: A medium to double weight paper stock A cool black image color A smooth, glossy surface (not ferrotyped) A <b>contrast</b> <b>grade</b> between 1. 5 and 2. 5 when the negative has a density range between 0. 90 and 1. 3 A density range of the original greater than 1. 4 but less than 1. 9 with gradients equal to 12 plus/minus 1 gradient To obtain the appropriate highlight, midtone and shadow densities on the photographic print, a darkroom tool was developed and successfully tested as a three step reference for the photographer to insure proper placement of these predetermined tones for an optimum reproduction. The 2 ̆ 2 visual comparator 2 ̆ 2 is waterproof and is used when the print is wet; however, examination of the photographic print takes place under standard viewing conditions. Another advantage of the comparator is that it is made of the same photographic material as the photograph itself.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityMilitary aerial {{photography}} is, at the present, {{beginning a}} stage of transition. The camera systems in use until this time usually have produced photography resolving approximately ten to twenty lines per millimeter on the print, in practice. For such photography to be useful in reasonably detailed photointertation, it has been necessary that it be at relatively large scales, normally {{in the range of}} 1 : 5, 000 to 1 : 15, 000. Since high flight altitude is desirable to provide a reasonable probability of successfully completing a mission in the presence of opposition, the scale requirement has necessitated the use of long focal length cameras. However, in the newer aircraft, the space and carrying capacity available is decreasing drastically. It appears certain that to provide further increases in aerodynamic performance in the future, this trend will continue. In addition, technical intelligence requirements are becoming much more severe, requiring that aerial photography resolve much smaller dimensions on the ground than has been the case previously. Fortunately, a new generation of aerial cameras is being developed to keep pace, the so called "high-acuity" cameras. Resolution with these may be expected to exceed considerably that obtained with previous cameras. These high-acuity systems offer the potential for keeping pace with the increasingly severe intelligence, aerodynamic and photographic interpretation requirements. The human eye may be considered to have a maximum resolving power of approximately ten lines per millimeter. Assuming that photography from high acuity systems will resolve at least fifty lines per millimeter, and possibly exceed one-hundred, a magnification of from five to more than ten will be required to fully benefit from this resolution. Such magnification may occur either in printing the negatives, in the viewing device used by the interpreter, or in some combination in the two stages. From several standpoints, however, it appears certain that an appreciable part will be in the printing process. In photography, it is axiomatic that resolution is lost in virtually every process. In projection printing, this loss is attributable to not only the projection: lens and printing material, but also to other characteristics of the projection printer. One of these of potential importance is the cone angle of the illumination furnished by the printer at a given point on the negative. Projection printers fall into two classes: those employing diffuse illumination, in which the illumination cone angle may approach 180 degrees, and those employing illumination directed by a condensing-lens system, in which type the cone angle may be in the vicinity of twenty degrees. Most authorities agree that, other conditions being equivalent, a print made with a diffuse-type printer will have less contrast than one made with a condenser-type printer. From theory, any loss of contrast should result in a loss of resolution. To fully benefit from the increased capability of the new high-acuity camera systems, it is important that losses of resolution which may arise in the projection printing process be minimized. Accordingly, this investigation was made to determine the dependence of projection print resolution on the cone angle of the illumination incident at a point on the negative. It can be shown that, so far as factors affecting print resolution are concerned, the difference in illumination cone angle represents the only practical difference between the two classes of projection printers. Therefore, the procedure used in the investigation consisted in varying the illumination cone angle in a projection printer in eight steps between the limits of seven and 180 degrees. Print resolution was evaluated, and the maximum at each step was plotted against the illumination cone angle of that step. The illumination source used was a four inch diameter disk of flashed opal glass, evenly illuminated from the reverse side by six 15 -watt daylight-type flourescent tubes. The various illumination cone angles at the negative were obtained by varying the distance between the negative and the source disk. Two negatives were used {{in the course of the}} experiment. Both were 1 : 22. 1 reductions of an original Buckbee-Meers U. S. Air Force resolution target, were made in a resolving-power test camera, and were high-contrast targets. One was on an Eastman Kodak 548 High Resolution Plate and had a limiting resolution of 446 lines per millimeter; the other was on Eastman Kodak special emulsion S. O. 1213 on film, and had a limiting resolution of 125 lines per millimeter. The latter was the one intended to approximate photography obtained with a high-acuity camera system. The projection lens was a Schneider Componon 80 mm focal length f/ 4 enlarging lens. The lens was used at f/ 5. 6 throughout the investigation; at this aperture and within the limited angular field used, it gave essentially diffraction-limited performance. The printing material employed was Kodabromide projection printing paper, series were made on both Contrast Two and Contrast Four papers. For each cone angle (with each negative and printing paper <b>contrast</b> <b>grade),</b> exposures were made at five lens-to-easel distances differing by a small increment; this insured a run through best focus. At each distance, five exposures were made differing in exposure by a one-half stop increment in terms of time; this insured a run through optimum exposure. All prints were developed for 90 seconds in Kodak Dektol 2 : 1 at 68 °F in a tray with continuous agitation, and fixed for seven minutes in one bath of Kodak Rapid Fix. Print resolution was evaluated by an experienced analyst; readings were made using a binocular microscope, reflected light, and either 13 X or 30 X magnification depending on the resolution level of the particular series. For a given level to be considered resolved, it was necessary that both the tangential and radial lines be resolved. Each print was evaluated twice, with the two readings being separated by approximately ten days. Analysis of the data resulting from the experiment revealed that with the H. R. 548 and S. O. 1213 emulsions used, there is no significant dependence of projection print resolution on the illumination cohe angle at the negative. Some differences were found, but these were both small and inconsistent. They are felt to have been the result of random inconsistencies, principally in the reading of resolution values at the justresolved level. The major factor which fubelieved to have been responsible for this lack of effect can be seen from a geometrical consideration of the passage of light through a negative. Consider light to be directed toward the negative at such an angle that, undeviated, it would reach the projection lens. For a clear area, the light will pass through largely undiminished and undeviated. Assuming no losses in the lens, this light will reach the image of the area. However, for an area having density, three effects will occur. A portion of the light will be absorbed in the negative and thus will be lost, photographically. Another portion will pass through undeviated. A third will be scattered in all directions; only so much of this as is within the angle subtended by the lens aperture will reach the image of the denser area. Presumably the latter two portions when combined in the image will render the dense area in the proper tonal relation. Now consider additional light to be made incident on the two areas of the negative, with the direction of this light being such that, undeviated, it would not reach the projection lens. Obviously a portion of this light will also be scattered by the dense area, and a portion of this will reach the image of that area. This, then, will alter the tonal relation of the print; it will, in fact, reduce the contrast of the two areas. This accounts for the frequently mentioned difference in contrast rendition between condenser-type and diffuse-type projection printers. The latter supply a large portion of their light at angles which are larger than that subtended by the projection lens from a given point on the negative. The reason that the foregoing did not affect the results of the present investigation lies in the fine grain nature of the negative materials used. While a coarse grained material of high density may scatter nearly all of the light transmitted, the same is not true of fine grained materials. The materials designed for use with high-acuity camera systems are fine-grained; and future materials will probably be even more so as emulsion technology advances. Two other factors probably contributed to the observed lack of dependence of resolution on cone angle. One is the fact that for a negative illuminated by a flat Lambertian source, the intensity reaching a point on the negative at a plane angle "a" to the nomal is proportional to cos^ 3 a. Further, the portion which is lost by reflection rapidly increases for larger values of angle a. The combined effect is that once a moderate angle is exceeded, further increases should have relatively little photographic effect. This, of course, applies regardless of the nature of the negative emulsion. As a result of this investigation, two major conclusions have been reached: a. With the newer films having very fine grain and a high resolution capability, any dependence of projection print resolution on negative-illumination cone angle is negligible. b. Projection printers intended for use with high-acuity camera systems need not be limited by a requirement for a particular illumination cone angle, but rather may be designed to best meet other pertinent considerations...|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} single-vesicle {{approach}} {{to compare the}} all-or-none and graded mechanisms of lipid bilayer permeabilization by CpreTM and NpreTM, two peptides derived from the membrane-proximal external region of the HIV fusion glycoprotein gp 41 subunit. According to bulk requenching assays, these peptides permeabilize large unilamellar vesicles via all-or-none and graded mechanisms, respectively. Visualization of the process using giant unilamellar vesicles shows that the permeabilization of individual liposomes by these two peptides differs in kinetics, degree of dye filling, and stability of the permeabilized state. All-or-none permeabilization by CpreTM is characterized by fast and total filling of the individual vesicles. This process is usually accompanied by the formation of stably open pores, as judged from {{the capacity of the}} vesicles to incorporate a second dye added after several hours. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>graded</b> permeabilization by NpreTM is transient and exhibits slower kinetics, which leads to partial filling of the individual liposomes.

In well-oxygenated kidneys perfused for 2 h at 12 ml/min, with hematocrit of 0. 09 +/- 0. 005 and PO 2 of 443 +/- 67 mmHg, EPO mRNA levels were similar to the baseline levels measured in nonperfused contralateral kidneys from the same animals.

However, data concerning ECV with non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is limited. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the efficacy and safety of NOACs in patients undergoing ECV in a real-world clinical practice at a single center in Japan. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 406 consecutive patients who underwent ECV for atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter under anticoagulation with one of the three NOACs (n= 149) or with a VKA (n= 257). Results: The CHADS 2 and HAS-BLED scores were significantly higher in the VKA group, whereas the NOACs group had a tendency toward greater spontaneous echo <b>contrast</b> <b>grades.</b> After ECV, ischemic stroke occurred in three patients of the VKA group and one patient in the NOAC group, all of whom had persistent AF, indicating no significant difference in the thromboembolic event rate within 30 days following ECV. No other thromboembolic events, major bleeding, or death occurred in either group. Among the NOAC and VKA patients in whom we newly introduced an oral anticoagulant to perform ECV, the number of days leading to ECV was significantly lesser for the NOAC patients. Conclusion: NOACs may be used as an alternative to VKAs for ECV and may allow prompt ECV in clinical practices...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{relationship}} of {{serum alanine aminotransferase}} (ALT) level and viral replication to liver damage in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients remains unclear. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether the stage of fibrosis correlates with HCV-RNA titer and/or serum ALT level in patients with chronic hepatitis C (genotype 4) infection. Clinical and biochemical characteristics were collected from 138 patients with chronic HCV genotype 4 infection. Quantitative HCV-RNA level measurement, HCV genotyping, and abdominal ultrasonography were investigated in all patients. Liver biopsy was done for 80 patients and the remaining 58 patients were examined using Fibroscan. Highly significant higher percentage of cases with high level of HCV viremia was found among patients with fibrosis stage 3 as compared to other stages of fibrosis. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>grades</b> of activity were independent of serum HCV-RNA titer. Patients with stages 1 and 4 hepatic fibrosis had significantly higher levels of ALT than patients with other stages of fibrosis. In contrast, an insignificant correlation was found between ALT level and grade of necroinflammation. In conclusion neither ALT level nor HCV viremia can reflect the histological liver change accurately. As a result, liver biopsy or other noninvasive procedures that measure liver stiffness (i. e., Fibroscan) remain essential for accurate staging of liver fibrosis in patients with genotype 4 chronic HCV infection...|$|R

Graded doses of 17 beta-estradiol (5 % to 40 %) reduce formalin-induced behavior by 35 % to 49 % during phase 2 but not during phase 1, as; measured with an automated formalin apparatus. The maximal response is seen with 20 % 17 beta-estradiol. The antihyperalgesic effect of 20 % 17 beta-estradiol is significant at 8 days after implantation and persists at 21 days. In <b>contrast,</b> <b>graded</b> doses of progesterone have no effect on either phase of formalin. The estrogen receptor antagonist tamoxifen completely prevents the antihyperalgesic effect of the 20 % 17 beta-estradiol implant. Formalin-induced behaviors during phase 2 are significantly less in proestrus females and OVX rats given 20 % 17 beta-estradiol compared with OVX control rats. Also, the formalin-induced increase in serum corticosterone is attenuated in OVX control rats compared with proestrus females and OVX rats given 20 % 17 beta-estradiol. These results indicate that estrogen replacement in OVX rats restores the maximal corticosterone response to tonic pain and, by an estrogen receptor-mediated process, inhibits tonic pain. Pe rspective: Hormone replacement (HR) therapy remains a widely used modality. We used a pharmacokinetically based rat HR model that results in continuous physiological levels of 17 beta-estradiol to demonstrate the analgesic (antihyperalgesic) effects of estrogen replacement in an inflammatory pain model (formalin). These results suggest a potentially important consequence of HR therapy. (C) 2007 by the American Pain Society...|$|R
