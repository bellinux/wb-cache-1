On 18 June 1944 one hundred seventy seven men and four {{officers}} of Company B, 91st Naval Construction Battalion (Seabee), arrived from Milne Bay to dismantle station's buildings and facilities, removeing and <b>crating</b> over 5,000 tons {{of materials and}} equipment and loading it aboard ship before departing 31 August 1944 and their return to Brisbane.|$|E
25|$|At American tracks greyhounds {{are kept}} in kennel compounds, in crates that are {{approximately}} three feet wide, four feet deep, and three feet high. Most kennels turn the dogs out 4 to 6 times per day. Each turnout can be from 30 to 90 minutes. Because greyhound kennels often house upwards of 50â€“70 dogs, <b>crating</b> {{is essential to the}} safety and wellbeing of canine life. Greyhounds are cared for by professional and licensed staff.|$|E
25|$|In September, 1906, {{the company}} {{announced}} plans to construct a fireproof freight house. Additionally, the company also built both a sawmill {{to be used in}} working up material used in the sills of the Franklin automobiles, and a narrow-gauge railway throughout the entire factory yards and buildings to facilitate the handling of materials. The freight house was constructed with wide platforms, which were completely covered by a protruding roof. A spur of the Lackawanna railroad was already complete, and tracks were laid that passed {{on each side of the}} building, one side for receiving goods and the other for dispatching them. The equipment of this department included, a shipper's office, accumulating room, <b>crating</b> room and sundry packing department.|$|E
40|$|This {{demonstration}} project studied {{the differences in}} farrowing <b>crate</b> designs and the survival of piglets. Three basic <b>crate</b> designs were studied: <b>crates</b> with hydraulic side rails, <b>crates</b> with solid rod finger side rails, and freestall <b>crates.</b> <b>Crates</b> with hydraulic sides in this study had more pigs born alive, had fewer pigs born dead, weaned more pigs, and had higher weaned litter weights than any other <b>crate</b> studied. The freestall <b>crates</b> had the least number of pigs born alive, weaned fewest pigs, and had the lightest litter weaned weights. Freestall <b>crates</b> fell {{in the middle of}} hydraulic and solid rod <b>crates</b> for pigs born dead. The solid rod <b>crates</b> fell in the middle of hydraulic and freestall <b>crates</b> for pigs born alive and weaned litter weight. Solid rod <b>crates</b> weaned slightly more pigs than freestalls. Solid rod <b>crates</b> had the most number of pigs born dead. Flooring layout was not replicated for all <b>crate</b> designs.

In this role he was responsible for <b>crating</b> and shipping to Point Cook the 128 aircraft and associated spares, weaponry, vehicles, hangars and other equipment that made up Britain's post-war Imperial Gift of Royal Air Force surplus to Australia, which eventually filled 19,000 cases. Mackinolty also completed formal training in aeronautical engineering before returning to Melbourne in October 1920.

As junior officer in the squadron, he was assigned the collateral duties of squadron adjutant and supply officer.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the union}} out on strike, Remington Rand quickly began {{consolidating}} its plants. The company later admitted {{that it had}} long wanted to close several of its plants, but that the union was too strong {{and would not have}} permitted it. [...] Remington Rand contracted with millwrights several months before the strike began (discussions which courts and federal agencies later interpreted {{as a sign of the}} company's bad-faith bargaining) to dismantle the plants. [...] Within days of the strike's commencement, Remington Rand contractors began <b>crating</b> plant machinery in Middletown, Syracuse and Tonawanda. Workers tried blocking the millwrights and trucks from entering and leaving the plant but were mostly unsuccessful. Strikers subsequently pelted trucks with stones, bricks and bottles, or laid iron spikes in the roadway to puncture the tires of trucks.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of wooden <b>crate</b> designs. By {{far the most}} common are 'closed', 'open' and 'framed'. A Closed <b>Crate</b> {{is one that is}} completely or nearly completely enclosed with material such as plywood or lumber boards. When lumber is used, gaps are often left between the boards to allow for expansion. An Open <b>Crate</b> is one that (typically) uses lumber for sheathing. The sheathing is typically gapped by at various distances. There is no strict definition of an open <b>crate</b> as compared to a closed <b>crate.</b> Typically when the gap between boards is greater than the distance required for expansion, the <b>crate</b> would be considered an open <b>crate.</b> The gap between boards would typically not be greater than the width of the sheathing boards. When the gap is larger, the boards are often considered 'cleats' rather than sheathing thus rendering the <b>crate</b> unsheathed. An unsheathed <b>crate</b> is a frame <b>crate.</b> A Frame <b>Crate</b> is one that only contains a skeletal structure and no material is added for surface or pilferage protection. Typically an open <b>crate</b> will be constructed of 12 pieces of lumber, each along an outer edge of the content and more lumber placed diagonally to avoid distortion from torque.|$|R

5000|$|Without proper conditioning, dogs may vocalize their {{distress}} and make efforts {{to escape the}} crates. <b>Crating</b> suppresses the dog's behavior, removes the dog's freedom of movement and is a negative punishment (removal of reward) under operant conditioning. Dogs who do not react well to negative punishment may find <b>crating</b> highly stressful. Long term or excessive crate confinement [...] "may lead to emotional and behavioral deterioration over time." [...] To the extent that <b>crating</b> reduces the amount of exposure to different environmental and social situations, it can make dogs more reactive (fearful or aggressive) or intolerant of novel situations. <b>Crating</b> [...] "may significantly exacerbate the {{distress and}} emotional reactivity associated with separation distress". Behavioral problems that compels owners to crate train in the first place, may be exacerbated by {{the negative effects of}} <b>crating.</b> A dog may form a strong attachment to the crate eventually, feeling comfort and safety, after the initial feeling of distress and vulnerability. This behavioral effect has been compared to Stockholm syndrome. Dogs that are trained to sleep in a crate, when allowed to sleep in a bedroom, can show signs consistent with that of separation distress, suggesting that dogs may love their crate [...] "perhaps in some cases more than they love the owner." [...] This bond with the crate may interfere with the human-animal bond and exacerbate bond-related behavior problems such as separation distressand owner-directed aggression.|$|E

Cleats may be placed {{anywhere}} between the edges of a given panel. On <b>crates,</b> cleat placement is often determined by {{the width of the}} plywood used on plywood sheathed <b>crates.</b> On other <b>crates,</b> cleats are often evenly spaced as required to strengthen the panel.
