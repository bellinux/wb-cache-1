Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede {{participates in}} orbital {{resonances}} with Europa and Io: for every orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times. The superior conjunction between Io and Europa always occurs when Io is at periapsis and Europa at apoapsis. The superior conjunction between Europa and Ganymede occurs when Europa is at periapsis. The longitudes of the Io–Europa and Europa–Ganymede conjunctions <b>change</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same rate, making triple conjunctions impossible. Such a complicated resonance {{is called the}} Laplace resonance.|$|E

5|$|Fez is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) puzzle platform game {{set in a}} three-dimensional (3D) world. The player-character Gomez lives peacefully on a 2D plane until he receives a red fez and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden hexahedron that tears the fabric of spacetime and reveals a third dimension. After the game appears to glitch, reset, and reboot, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the levels by connecting otherwise inaccessible platforms, and {{is the basis of}} Fez puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments, which accrete to restore order to the universe. In search of these cubes, Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming elements <b>change</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> level themes, including crates that activate switches, bombs that reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne.|$|E

As such, women were discouraged from joining the military. Only {{a small number of}} Hispanic women joined the military before World War II. However, with the outbreak of World War II, cultural prohibitions began to <b>change.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> creation of the Marine Corps Women's Reserve, women such as Corporal Maria (Torres) Maes could attend to certain administrative duties left open by the men who were reassigned to combat zones.

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} 12th century the Germans played a {{relatively}} modest {{role in the}} north European trade. However, this was to <b>change</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> development of Hanseatic trade, {{as a result of}} which German traders became prominent in the Baltic and the North Sea regions. Following the death of Eric VI of Denmark, German forces attacked and sacked Denmark, bringing with them artisans and merchants under the new administration which controlled the Hansa regions. During the third quarter of the 14th century the Hanseatic trade faced two major difficulties: economic conflict with the Flanders and hostilities with Denmark. These events {{led to the formation of}} an organized association of Hanseatic towns, which replaced the earlier union of German merchants. This new Hansa of the towns, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants and trade, was prominent for the next hundred and fifty years.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{doubt this}} traditional account, arguing instead that the monarchy {{evolved into a}} government led by elected magistrates. Remnants of the monarchy, however, were reflected in republican institutions, such as the religious office of rex sacrorum ("king of the sacred") and the interregnum (a period of time presided over by an interrex when the offices of consul, praetor, and dictator were all vacant). There, is, however, certainly evidence that the early Republic {{was a time of}} violent <b>change,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> word rex carrying the same connotations as tyrant and laws which declared forfeit the life and property of any man who plotted to install himself as a king or tyrant.|$|E

5|$|The Avars {{initially}} were nomadic horsemen, {{but both}} large cemeteries used by {{three or four}} generations {{and a growing number}} of settlements attest to their adoption of a sedentary (non-nomadic) way of life from the 8th century. The Avars' power was destroyed between 791 and 795 by Charlemagne, who occupied Transdanubia and attached it to his empire. Archaeological investigation of early medieval rural settlements at Balatonmagyaród, Nemeskér and other places in Transdanubia demonstrate that their main features did not <b>change</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fall of the Avar Khaganate. New settlements appeared in the former borderlands with cemeteries characterized by objects with clear analogues in contemporary Bavaria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Moravia and other faraway territories. A manor defended by timber walls (similar to noble courts of other parts of the Carolingian Empire) was unearthed at Zalaszabar.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks on}} Bien Hoa forced {{a change in}} tactics for the Australians, and 1 ATF's mission was quickly changed from reconnaissance-in-force to a {{blocking}} operation designed to intercept withdrawing communist forces. Between 31 January and 1 February, the Australian battalions moved into company blocking positions {{and a number of}} minor contacts occurred, resulting in some Viet Cong casualties and the capture of more weapons and equipment. Once in position, the intensity of these clashes increased as the Australians sprung platoon ambushes. Indeed, during early February, the nature of contacts in AO Columbus began to <b>change,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Australians increasingly faced by larger company-sized Main Force units located in static defensive positions. During the first week of February the Viet Cong began streaming through the AO, retreating from Saigon in the wake of heavy losses during Tet. Although the Viet Cong managed to avoid becoming decisively engaged, around 90 were killed and five captured, as the Australians maintained their blocking positions.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} and oppressive {{treatment of the}} slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found {{tens of thousands of}} willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a serious threat to the Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a potential threat to the city of Rome. This would all <b>change</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Third Servile War.|$|E

5|$|This {{situation}} {{started to}} gradually <b>change</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ascension of Pope Leo IX (1049–1054) {{and the beginning}} of the Reform Papacy. This pope, in order to reform the corrupted Roman clergy, appointed several new cardinals from the monastic centers outside Rome, such as Monte Cassino, Remiremont and Cluny. These new cardinals became his close advisors. Leo’s successors continued this trend and Nicholas II in 1059 gave the cardinals the exclusive right to elect a new pope. At the end of the 11th century the boca formed a single College of Cardinals, which became the main body of the papal government — they served as experts or judges in the legal causes (auditors), countersigned the solemn papal privileges, acted as governors of the cities or provinces of the Papal States or were sent by the popes on important diplomatic missions. The cardinals became the most important members of the Roman Curia, and as such were still required to reside in the papal court, unless they were dispatched for a legatine mission in the name of the pope.|$|E
5|$|Where Americans had a {{historic}} {{disdain for the}} refineries of French cooking, that opinion, {{at least in a}} small part, began to <b>change</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> American alliance with the French. In the first American publication of Hannah Glasse's Art of Cookery Made Easy, insults aimed at French dishes disappeared. A number of Bostonians even attempted to cook French cuisine for their French allies, sometimes with comedic results when entire frogs were put into soups rather than just their legs. Nonetheless, the alliance supported a friendship with France that later resulted in a large migration of French cooks and chefs to America during the French Revolution.|$|E
5|$|According {{to those}} historians, the Spanish {{revolution}} against absolutism got {{mixed up with}} the Peninsular War. When FerdinandVII stood against his father CharlesIV, who {{was seen as an}} absolutist king, many Spaniards got the mistaken impression that he sympathized with the new enlightened ideas. Thus, the revolutions made in the Americas in the name of FerdinandVII (such as the May Revolution, the Chuquisaca Revolution, or the one in Chile) would have sought to replace absolutist power with power formulated under the new ideas. Even if Spain was at war with France, the ideals of the French Revolution (liberty, equality and fraternity) were still respected. Those revolutions pronounced themselves enemies of Napoleon, but did not face any active French military attack; they promoted instead fights between Spanish armies for keeping either the old or new order. This situation would <b>change</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> final defeat of Napoleon and the return of FerdinandVII to the throne, as he began the Absolutist Restoration and persecuted the supporters of the new libertarian ideas within Spain. For people in South America, to stay {{as a part of the}} Spanish Empire, but with a new relationship with the mother country, was no longer a feasible option: the only remaining options at this point were to return to absolutism or to adopt independentism.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, celadon was a prized import in East Africa, which was {{initially}} {{obtained from the}} Ming Dynasty in exchange for ivory. However, knowledge of direct exchange with the Chinese is restricted to a single account of a Chinese fleet harbored off of Malindi and Mombasa between 1417 and 1419. The number of imports from China and elsewhere continued to increase throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, represented by {{a large number of}} black on yellow Islamic wares and celadon. Also during the fourteenth century, local wares began to diversify with Gedi's expanding economy. During {{the beginning and end of}} the fifteenth century, respectively, blue and white porcelain began to gradually replace celadon and monochrome Islamic wares completely replaced black on yellow types. During the same century, local wares began to <b>change</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reduction in the number of incised ornamental patterns and a shift to long necked-pots, compared to earlier short-necked variants. In the following century, blue and white porcelain and monochrome Islamic wares became the dominant imports; a trend that began to emerge in the previous century and would continue until Gedi's decline in the seventeenth century.|$|E

While most women who served in the military joined the WAACs, a smaller number of women served in the Naval Women's Reserve (the WAVES). One of the first Hispanic women to serve in the USAAF was Staff Sergeant Eva Romero Jacques. Romero Jacques, who spoke Spanish and English and had three years of college spent two years in the Pacific Theater, 1944 in New Guinea and 1945 in the Philippines, as an administrative aide. She survived a plane disaster when the craft in which she was on crashed in the jungles of New Guinea.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{technical}} {{reason for this}} difficulty is that the frequency response of a simple filter approaches a fall of 6 dB/octave far {{from the point of}} resonance. This means that if telephone channels are squeezed in side-by-side into the frequency spectrum, there will be crosstalk from adjacent channels in any given channel. What is required is a much more sophisticated filter that has a flat frequency response in the required passband like a low-Q resonant circuit, but that rapidly falls in response (much faster than 6dB/octave) at the transition from passband to stopband like a high-Q resonant circuit. Obviously, these are contradictory requirements to be met with a single resonant circuit. The solution to these needs was founded in the theory of transmission lines and consequently the necessary filters did not become available until this theory was fully developed. At this early stage the idea of signal bandwidth, and hence the need for filters to match to it, was not fully understood; indeed, it was as late as 1920 before the concept of bandwidth was fully established. For early radio, the concepts of Q-factor, selectivity and tuning sufficed. This was all to <b>change</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> developing theory of transmission lines on which image filters are based, as explained in the next section.|$|E
