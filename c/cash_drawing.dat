Edward had broadly three types of treasure: his ceremonial regalia, which was usually kept at the Tower of London or held by the Abbot of Westminster; the jewellery and plate belonging to the Crown, which was kept by the Royal Treasurer at Westminster Abbey; and his personal collection of jewels and plate. English monarchs during this period used their personal jewels and plate {{as a substitute for}} <b>cash,</b> <b>drawing</b> on them to fund their military campaigns, or giving them as symbolic political gifts. Edward accumulated what historian Jenny Stratford has described as a [...] "vast store of jewels and plate", and his collection of personal treasure was at its greatest during the 1360s.|$|E

40|$|The Netherlands and the Nordic {{countries}} {{are faced with}} a rapid decline in the use of cash. Sooner or later, they will be confronted with the question whether cash remains necessary as well-functioning means of payment for POS transactions. This paper focuses on how this issue is addressed in the Netherlands and the Nordics, based on answers to a detailed questionnaire submitted to the central banks of these countries, covering the three main elements of the well-functioning of cash: paying in <b>cash,</b> <b>drawing</b> cash from, and lodging cash in one 2 ̆ 019 s bank account. All central banks seem to believe that at least for the foreseeable future, cash remains needed as well-functioning means of payment. Leaving legal issues aside, main arguments are that for part of the population, use of electronic payment instruments is not, or not always, possible or desirable. In addition, cash functions as fall back in case of temporary breakdowns in the functioning of, or trust in, the electronic payment system. In Norway and the Netherlands, this view seems shared by the government and society at large. As far as Denmark, Finland and Sweden are concerned, a broad consensus and a general policy to 2 ̆ 018 manage 2 ̆ 019 the decline of cash have not or not yet materialized. Once authorities and society at large are convinced that cash remains needed as well-functioning means of payment, it has to be determined whether, and if so which, specific action is required to keep cash well-functioning as means of payment. In this respect, unlike the market approach (at least so far) favored in Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands adopted a pro-active approach, with the idea that it is easier to prevent unwelcome developments than to correct them once they have occurred. In the Netherlands, agreement has been reached on a cooperative approach...|$|E

Based on standard economic priors, we investigate whether this credit supply shock has a differential impact on the real and financial policies of credit constrained firms. In contrast to previous research, which has used proxies such as firm size and credit ratings to measure constraint, we survey 1, 050 CFOs in the U.

Our evidence shows that the impact of the financial crisis is severe on credit constrained firms, leading to deeper cuts in planned R&D, employment, and capital spending. These firms also burn through more <b>cash,</b> <b>draw</b> more heavily on lines of credit for fear banks will restrict access in the future, and sell more assets to fund their operations.

This model allows for multiple sorting variables, does not require finance constraints to increase monotonically with the sorting variables and enables firms to endogenously change regime over the sample period.
