50|$|In the Bavarian/Austrian region, the scheitholt can {{be traced}} back to the 14th century. Similar {{instruments}} are found in other parts of Northern Europe; in America, the scheitholt was probably brought to Pennsylvania by German settlers and spread into the Appalachian mountain region, where it later evolved into the Appalachian dulcimer in the late 18th century. The Appalachian <b>dulcimer</b> (<b>or</b> mountain <b>dulcimer,</b> <b>or</b> lap <b>dulcimer),</b> is a scheitholt fingerboard mounted on a larger sound box.|$|R

50|$|This simple tune {{is often}} used in old-time music circles to teach young folks {{how to play the}} fiddle, banjo, {{mountain}} dulcimer and/or guitar. The following is the basic tune with the lyrics of the chorus. These tabs assume the player has a diatonically fretted instrument tuned to one of the 1-5-8 open tunings like G-D-G or D-A-D, such as one might find on a mountain <b>dulcimer</b> <b>or</b> a stick <b>dulcimer.</b>|$|R
50|$|Salterio is the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese {{term for}} either of two types of zither: the {{hammered}} <b>dulcimer</b> <b>or</b> psaltery.|$|R
50|$|I {{have also}} {{come across a}} more {{traditionally}} designed qinqin built in Shanghai that, from its picture, looks like the fret layout corresponds to the Western 12TET standard and it has 12 frets per octave just like a guitar. A photo appears {{in one of the}} external links below. If the future fret layout of qinqins were left to me, I'd fret it just like a mountain <b>dulcimer</b> <b>or</b> stick <b>dulcimer,</b> using the seven Mixolydian mode notes (fret positions) per octave plus fret 6.5 which allows Ionian mode (major scale) songs to also be played without having to re-tune the instrument. I feel the qinqin, with its banjo like sound box would make a great stick dulcimer if only they could work out the fret arrangement.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{very simple}} form of psaltery or box zither, made of a wooden {{sounding}} box, with strings stretched from end to end, lengthwise. Its construction {{is similar to that}} of the Aeolian harp <b>or</b> Appalachian <b>dulcimer.</b> The Pyrenean version of the instrument numbers 4 to 10 strings but 3 sets of 2 (6 total) is the common arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The bowhammer is {{a recent}} musical {{invention}} created by the musician Michael Masley, who is the premiere user of this tool. The sound generated is significantly different from that generated by the traditional hammering of the cymbalom, that the artist considers the bowhammer cymbalom a specific instrument. The bowhammer may be usable on other string instruments, such as the guitar <b>or</b> hammered <b>dulcimer,</b> but no other uses have surfaced to date.|$|R
60|$|Through the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not {{leaves in}} murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds <b>or</b> whatdoyoucallthem <b>dulcimers</b> {{touching}} their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, {{heard from a}} person wouldn't expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.|$|R
50|$|The singing {{accompanied}} by a musical instrument such as the guzheng (bridged zither), yehu (coconut-shell bowed lute), <b>or</b> yangqin (hammered <b>dulcimer),</b> together with the percussion instrument ban (wooden clappers). The instrument or instruments were played either by the singer himself/herself or in duo with a fellow musician.|$|R
50|$|Versions of the santur <b>or</b> {{hammered}} <b>dulcimer</b> {{are used}} throughout the world. In Eastern Europe, a larger descendant of the hammered dulcimer called the cimbalom is played and {{has been used by}} a number of classical composers, including Zoltán Kodály, Igor Stravinsky and Pierre Boulez, and more recently, in a different musical context, by Blue Man Group. The khim is the name of both the Thai and the Khmer hammered dulcimer. The Chinese yangqin is a type of hammered dulcimer that originated in Persia. The santur and santoor are found in the Middle East and India, respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Newman {{likes to}} vary the {{instrumentation}} in his scores, ranging from full orchestra to percussion-only music. He is also fond of incorporating unusual instruments {{such as the}} zither, hurdy-gurdy, psaltery and hammered <b>dulcimer,</b> <b>or</b> unexpected sounds, like Aboriginal chants and the chirping of cicadas. The composer declared that he has [...] "an interest in mundane experimentation." ...|$|R
50|$|Dulcitar (also stick <b>dulcimer</b> <b>or</b> strum-stick): a long-necked fretted instrument, {{similar to}} a guitar or mandolin, with {{diatonic}} dulcimer fretting. It differs from the guitar dulcimer chiefly in having a much narrower and shallower body, closer to the proportions of the soundbox of the Appalachian dulcimer. These instruments are known by {{a wide variety of}} names, with the most common commercial model being the McNally Strumstick.|$|R
50|$|The bowed dulcimer is {{a musical}} {{instrument}}. Designed {{in the style}} of the Appalachian dulcimer (a fretted string instrument of the zither family, typically with three or four strings), it is either a standard instrument played with a violin bow, <b>or</b> a purpose-built <b>dulcimer</b> designed around bow playing. The purpose-designed instrument is described as resembling a hybrid between a dulcimer and a cello or viola da gamba.|$|R
50|$|The santoor is a trapezoid-shaped {{hammered}} <b>dulcimer</b> <b>or</b> string {{musical instrument}} made of walnut, with seventy-two strings. It {{is the national}} musical instrument of Iran, and is also native to Jammu and Kashmir. It dates back to ancient times, and was called Shatha Tantri Veena in ancient Sanskrit texts. A primitive ancestor {{of this type of}} instrument was used in Mesopotamia (1600-911 BC) and Babylonia.|$|R
5000|$|Virag Antal, {{founder of}} the group, learned to play the {{traditional}} folk instruments hurdy-gurdy, zither and cimbalom <b>or</b> hammered <b>dulcimer</b> while at school in Hungary. It is a still rarity to see these instruments performed in Australia. She started the group in 1993 at the Queensland Conservatorium of Music among fellow students as a project. Before long the group started receiving requests to play other shows, and so began Tulipan's sudden rise in popularity. They were hot favourites at Brisbane's renowned indie-music nightclub, The Zoo, performing several sell-out shows at the venue. The band toured {{the east coast of}} Australia extensively and were a highly sought-after act at many Australian music festivals including Livid, Big Day Out and WOMADelaide. They were regular special guests at Woodford Folk Festival.|$|R
50|$|Since its {{inception}} in 1998, Tyva Kyzy has participated in numerous international festivals of world music in Europe and Japan. They also toured the United States in October 2005. Tyva Kyzy performs the five main styles of khöömei with traditional female vocal styles. They utilize a range of folk instruments including their own signature instrument the chadagan (similar to the zither <b>or</b> hammered <b>dulcimer).</b> Several members perform in the Tuvan National Orchestra and member Ayana Mongush conducts the orchestra. Their songs are a blend of contemporary and traditional culture, some very old and some written and composed by the group or specifically for them. Tyva Kyzy performs a number of songs, often relating {{to the life of}} women, songs of their elders and of the land. They were recognized as the best players of national instruments in the Ustu-Hure Festival in Chadan, Tyva.|$|R
50|$|The band uses many {{homemade}} devices as instruments, {{such as the}} Viking Rowboat. Dan Rathbun — who {{has created}} most of the band's idiosyncratic instruments — plays, among other custom-made instruments (though he uses a common bass guitar most of the time), a custom-stringed bass instrument {{referred to as the}} Sledgehammer <b>Dulcimer</b> (<b>or,</b> alternately, the Slide Piano Log), which uses piano strings and is possibly more than 7 feet long; it is played with two sticks: one in the left hand generally used as a fret, and another in the right hand to strike the strings.|$|R
50|$|Klezmer is {{generally}} instrumental, although at weddings klezmorim traditionally accompanied the vocal stylings of the badkhn (wedding entertainer). A typical 19th-century European orchestra included a first violin, a contra-violin (or modified 3-stringed viola also called Groyse Fidl Big Fiddle, Sekund, Kontra or Zsidó Bratsch Hun.), a tsimbl (cimbalom <b>or</b> hammered <b>dulcimer),</b> a bass <b>or</b> cello, {{and sometimes a}} flute. Other instruments such as a piano or an accordion are used too. The melody {{is generally}} assigned to the lead violin, while the other instrumentalists provide harmony, rhythm, and some counterpoint (the latter usually coming from the second violin or viola). The inclusion of Jews in tsarist army bands during the 19th century led {{to the introduction of}} typical military band instruments into klezmer. Brass instruments—such as the French valved cornet and keyed German trumpet—eventually inherited a counter-voice role. Modern klezmer instrumentation is more commonly influenced by the instruments of the 19th century military bands than the earlier orchestras. The orchestration used by Joel Rubin—one of the most experienced and knowledgeable contemporary klezmer musicians—represents a historically justified link with that of contemporary ethnic music ensembles of Romania and Hungary.|$|R
50|$|The Khim (Khmer: ឃឹម Khum;Thai: ขิม, Thai pronunciation: kʰǐm;) is a {{stringed}} {{musical instrument}} that is from Persia, called Hammered <b>Dulcimer</b> <b>or</b> Cimbalon. This Khim {{was introduced to}} Cambodia, Laos and Thailand from China, where a similar (though, since the late 20th century, usually larger) instrument is called yangqin. This instrument {{is also known as}} Santur in India. It is played with two flexible bamboo sticks with soft leather at the tips to produce a soft tone. This instrument can be played by either sitting down on the floor with the khim on the floor, or by sitting on a chair or standing while the Khim is on a stand. The khim produces a bright and expressive sound when played. It is made of wood, with brass strings that are laid across the instrument. The Australian-born musician and vocal artist Lisa Gerrard specialises in the use of a khim hammered dulcimer, featuring its music on several albums and performing with the instrument live on tour.|$|R
5000|$|Hopkin's {{recording}} {{was produced}} by Paul McCartney with an arrangement by Richard Hewson (per the label of the record) and became a number-one hit on the UK Singles Chart. In the United States, Hopkin's recording reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 (held {{out of the top}} spot for three weeks by [...] "Hey Jude" [...] by the Beatles) and topped the Billboard Easy Listening charts for six weeks. In the Netherlands, it topped the charts for two consecutive weeks. The Russian origin of the melody was accentuated by an instrumentation that was unusual for a top-ten pop record, including balalaika, clarinet, hammered dulcimer, tenor banjo and children's chorus, giving a klezmer feel to the song. Mary Hopkin played acoustic guitar on the recording, and Paul McCartney also played acoustic guitar and possibly percussion. The hammered <b>dulcimer,</b> <b>or</b> cimbalom, was played by Gilbert Webster. It is unknown who played the banjo though McCartney is known to be a banjoist.|$|R
60|$|In {{the series}} of books I edit for my sister I confine myself to those that have I believe some special value to Ireland, now or in the future. I have asked Mr. Pound for these {{beautiful}} plays because I think they will help me to explain a certain possibility of the Irish dramatic movement. I am writing these words with my imagination stirred by {{a visit to the}} studio of Mr. Dulac, the distinguished illustrator of the Arabian Nights. I saw there the mask and head-dress to be worn in a play of mine by the player who will speak the part of Cuchulain, and who wearing this noble half-Greek half-Asiatic face will appear perhaps like an image seen in revery by some Orphic worshipper. I hope to have attained the distance from life which can make credible strange events, elaborate words. I have written a little play that can be played in a room for so little money that forty or fifty readers of poetry can pay the price. There will be no scenery, for three musicians, whose seeming sun-burned faces will I hope suggest that they have wandered from village to village in some country of our dreams, can describe place and weather, and at moments action, and accompany it all by drum and gong <b>or</b> flute and <b>dulcimer.</b> Instead of the players working themselves into a violence of passion indecorous in our sitting-room, the music, the beauty of form and voice all come to climax in pantomimic dance.|$|R
