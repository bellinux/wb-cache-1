It includes vacuum pump and chassis, speed display, power switch, suction piece switch, start switch and the speed control switch on the chassis panel, motor and speed controller in the chassis connected to the outside of the <b>chassis</b> <b>bracket,</b> the bracket beams fixed hanging umbrella cover, the ring hood under the umbrella cover on top of the face, the piece prop and tachometer probe in the ring hood, the chip tray fixed extended chassis top surface motor shaft, there is a solution injection tube {{on the top of the}} sheet tray in project; it has an annular heater chip at the bottom of the tray within the annular cover sheet around the motor shaft; In addition, there is an ultrasonic humidification pump, the pump output of the ultrasonic humidification communicating through the humidifying tubes with the annular cover. In above mentioned the annular cover connected to the exhaust pipe and the annular cover interior chamber. A temperature sensor is at the inside of the annular cover, and a temperature display panel on the panel of the chassi...|$|E
50|$|He {{ordered the}} short-tailed AEC Reliances to replace them. Then he {{returned}} to Halifax as GM and chief engineer to be greeted by ten NS3ANs. First came gasket failures, {{and in some cases}} he found part of the block burned away too, which he ascribed to incorrect combustion chamber design. BMC rear axle design was faulty, with half shafts cutting into sealing rings and starving the differential of oil. The automatic lubrication equipment, driven by an extension of the speedometer cable, frequently failed and failure of <b>chassis</b> <b>brackets</b> (as in the MR9s) was common. The use of a conventional engine driven vacuum-exhauster was given as a good point but the six-speed gearbox was in this implementation imprecise in operation.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{problems}} he encountered with the Great Yarmouth MR9s was, {{that in order for}} the automatic bypass vacuum generator to provide sufficient vacuum for braking assistance idling speed had to be kept low, this resulted in an engine straining at its mountings. Eventually failure of the mountings happened on one of them but not before another managed to shed its dynamo whilst in service, others had sheared a number of <b>chassis</b> <b>brackets.</b> He also found the gearchange linkage (although it kept the engine in place when the mountings failed) developed far too much free play and in order to select reverse on one he had to open the half-door on the passenger side of the cab. Others managed to grind to a halt when two gears were selected simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|The 944 Turbo S's {{suspension}} had the [...] "M030" [...] option {{consisting of}} Koni adjustable shocks front and rear, with ride height adjusting threaded collars {{on the front}} struts, progressive rate springs, larger hollow rear anti-roll/torsion bars, harder durometer suspension bushings, larger 26.8 mm hollow anti-roll/torsion bars at the front, and <b>chassis</b> stiffening <b>brackets</b> in the front frame rails. The air conditioning dryer lines are routed so as to clear the front frame brace on the driver's side. The 944 Turbo S wheels, known as the Club Sport design, were 16-inch Fuchs forged and flat-dished, similar to the Design 90 wheel. Wheel widths were 7 in in the front, and 9 in in the rear with 52 mm offset; sizes of the Z-rated tires were 225/50 {{in the front and}} 245/45 in the rear. The front and rear fender edges were rolled to accommodate the larger wheels. The manual transmission (case code designation: AOR) featured a higher friction clutch disc setup, an external cooler, and a limited slip differential with a 40% lockup setting. The Turbo S front brakes were borrowed from the Porsche 928 S4, with larger Brembo GT 4-piston fixed calipers and 12-inch discs; rear Brembo brakes remained the same as a standard Turbo. ABS also came standard.|$|R
5000|$|Tube-frame chassis pre-date {{spaceframe}} chassis and are {{a development}} of the earlier ladder chassis. The advantage of using tubes rather than the previous open channel sections is that they resist torsional forces better. Some tube chassis {{were little more than}} a ladder chassis made with two large diameter tubes, or even a single tube as a backbone chassis. Although many tubular chassis developed additional tubes and were even described as [...] "spaceframes", their design was rarely correctly stressed as a spaceframe and they behaved mechanically as a tube ladder <b>chassis,</b> with additional <b>brackets</b> to support the attached components, suspension, engine etc. The distinction of the true spaceframe is that all the forces in each strut are either tensile or compression, never bending. Although these additional tubes did carry some extra load, they were rarely diagonalised into a rigid spaceframe.|$|R
