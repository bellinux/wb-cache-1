5000|$|According to the {{journalist}} and author Graeme Hunt, domestic intelligence and <b>counter-subversion</b> prior {{to the establishment of}} the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service was primarily {{in the hands of the}} New Zealand Police Force (1919 - 1941; 1945 - 1949) and of the New Zealand Police Force Special Branch (1949 - 1956). Another predecessor to the NZSIS during the Second World War was the short-lived New Zealand Security Intelligence Bureau (SIB). The SIB, modeled after the British MI5, was headed by Major Kenneth Folkes, a junior MI5 officer. The conman Syd Ross duped Major Folkes into believing that there was a [...] "Nazi plot" [...] in New Zealand. Due to this embarrassment, Prime Minister Peter Fraser dismissed Folkes in February 1943 and the SIB merged into the New Zealand Police. Following the end of World War II in 1945, the Police Force resumed responsibility for domestic intelligence.|$|E
50|$|The Mk 4 Mod 0 was {{a variant}} of the M16A1 {{produced}} for the U.S. Navy SEALs during the Vietnam War and adopted in April 1970. It differed from the basic M16A1 primarily in being optimized for maritime operations and coming equipped with a sound suppressor. Most of the operating parts of the rifle were coated in Kal-Guard, a hole of 0.25 in was drilled through the stock and buffer tube for drainage, and an O-ring was added {{to the end of the}} buffer assembly. The weapon could reportedly be carried to the depth of 200 feet (60 m) in water without damage. The initial Mk 2 Mod 0 Blast Suppressor was based on the U.S. Army's Human Engineering Lab's (HEL) M4 noise suppressor. The HEL M4 vented gas directly from the action, requiring a modified bolt carrier. A gas deflector was added to the charging handle to prevent gas from contacting the user. Thus, the HEL M4 suppressor was permanently mounted though it allowed normal semi-automatic and automatic operation. If the HEL M4 suppressor were removed, the weapon would have to be manually loaded after each single shot. On the other hand, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was considered an integral part of the Mk 4 Mod 0 rifle, but it would function normally if the suppressor were removed. The Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor also drained water much more quickly and did not require any modification to the bolt carrier or to the charging handle. In the late 1970s, the Mk 2 Mod 0 blast suppressor was replaced by the Mk 2 blast suppressor made by Knight's Armament Company (KAC). The KAC suppressor can be fully submerged and water will drain out in less than eight seconds. It will operate without degradation even if the rifle is fired at the maximum rate of fire. The U.S. Army replaced the HEL M4 with the much simpler Studies in Operational Negation of Insurgency and <b>Counter-Subversion</b> (SIONICS) MAW-A1 noise and flash suppressor.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{study examines}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) interwar surveillance, harassment and {{repression of the}} Communist Party of Canada (CPC), primarily in Toronto from RCMP "O" Division, but also extends the discussion to include features of <b>counter-subversion</b> operations elsewhere, particularly in southwestern Ontario. These <b>counter-subversion</b> operations traversed three periods of activity: the early years 1920 - 28 : an interlude/ intelligence crisis {{which led to a}} debacle in 1931; and a period of reestablishing the intelligence network and an intensification of its countersubversion work from 1932 - 1939. Each period in question was characterized by specific types of intelligence network 'organization' and 'operation'. [...] My study of the rise, fall, and recovery of "'O" Division's core inter-war Toronto CPC intelligence network, examines {{the context in which the}} transformation took place linking it to the region's industrial and political order. I explain why intelligence networks, like the organizations they seek to infiltrate and the individuals whose activities they try to monitor, are anything but static and instead function as a part of the communities in which they live and face similar constraints. Intelligence networks expand and contract and shift both their investigative and operational focus. Their field investigations are malleable; their size, scope, and activities change for economic reasons and to meet both 'real' and 'perceived' threats. As local constructs intelligence networks are often best studied as a series of interactions established at the Divisional level. [...] The expansion, contraction, and transformation of "O" Division's key Toronto intelligence network influenced the types and quality of the information they secured. How intelligence networks functioned and how effective they were reflected the extent to which intelligence personnel adapted. Through much of the inter-war period "O'' Division relied heavily upon the work of secret/ special agents. Sometimes, however, less obtrusive and more distant forms of surveillance activity best suited the needs of intelligence personnel. A great deal depended upon their abilities. Success was also dictated by many other factors such as the abilities of CPC stalwarts and their subsidiary organizations. Only by paying close attention to these issues can we gain a more complete and accurate historical record of Canada’s intelligence past...|$|E
40|$|El objetivo de este artículo es argumentar acerca de la existencia de una preocupación central entre los responsables del denominado "Proceso de reorganización nacional". Dicha preocupación, según sostendremos, giraba en torno de la revelación de la verdad sobre el sistema {{criminal}} y clandestino, y generaba un conflicto interno en el frente militar acerca del sentido de la mentira con que los militares ocultaban ese sistema. El análisis de la dificultad para dar el nombre de "guerra" a la represión clandestina, del uso instrumental de las convicciones belicistas y del problema de la "imagen" del país, nos permitirá dar cuenta de esa preocupación a la vez que mostrará las limitaciones del sistema de representaciones belicistas mediante el cual los militares creían poder explicar y justificar los aspectos centrales de su régimen de terror y desaparición. The aim of {{this article}} is to argue on the existence of a main concern between the military chiefs of the so called "National Reorganization Process". This concern, according to our argument, turned around the revelation of the truth of the criminal and clandestine system, and generated an internal conflict between the military about the sense of the lie with which they hid that system. The analysis of the difficulty to name "war" the clandestine repression, of the instrumental use of the <b>counter-subversion</b> warfare convictions and of the problem of the "image" of the country, will allow us to give account of that concern as well as to show the limitations of the military representations system of "warfare" by means of which the military believed to be able to explain and to justify the central aspects of their regime of terror and disappearance...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a history of a {{hitherto}} unexplored dimension of Britain?s engagement with the post-war Middle East with a particular focus on intelligence and security aspects. More specifically, it examines the counter-subversive policies and measures conducted by the British Intelligence and Security Services, and Britain?s secret propaganda apparatus, the Information Research Department (IRD) of the Foreign Office, in Middle Eastern countries, such as Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iran, during the period between 1949 and 1963. This thesis is also about intelligence liaison ? the relationship between British Intelligence and Security Services and their Middle Eastern counterparts. This thesis argues that the British Empire declined between 1949 and 1963; in this, intelligence was understood by British policymakers as a tool to maintain British influence and preserve British strategic and economic interests in the Middle East. The imperial drive derived from a mixture of strategic and economic interests in the region but it was Britain?s anti-Communist attitudes which were shared with Middle Eastern governments. This was the context in which intelligence liaison was established between Britain and Middle Eastern states {{on the basis of their}} common interests. Although Britain?s anti-Communist policy contributed to preventing the spread of Communist movements in the region, it sought to strengthen the repressive capability of Middle Eastern governments which undermined their own political position by their repressiveness. An unintended consequence was that the Middle Eastern governments conducted <b>counter-subversion</b> not only against Communists, but also their own people. This thesis concludes that Britain?s anti-Communist policy sustained British influence and British interests in the region in the short term, but failed to sustain its objectives in the long term. It demonstrates the importance of common interests in encouraging intelligence liaison and the significance of conflicting interests in restricting it. E. H. Carr Studentship Awar...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with an analysis of British governmental attitudes and responses to communism in the United Kingdom {{during the early years}} of the Cold War, from the election of the Attlee government in July 1945 up until the election of the Wilson government in October 1964. Until recently the topic has been difficult to assess accurately, due to the scarcity of available original source material. However, as a result of multiple declassifications of both Cabinet Office and Security Service files over the past five years it is now possible to analyse the subject in greater depth and detail than had been previously feasible. The work is predominantly concerned with four key areas: firstly, why domestic communism continued to be viewed as a significant threat by successive governments – even despite both the ideology’s relatively limited popular support amongst the general public and Whitehall’s realisation that the Communist Party of Great Britain presented little by way of a direct challenge to British political stability. Secondly, how Whitehall’s understanding of the nature and severity of the threat posed by British communism developed between the late 1940 s and early ‘ 60 s, from a problem considered mainly of importance only to civil service security practices to one which directly impacted upon the conduct of educational policy and labour relations. Thirdly, how official <b>counter-subversion</b> methods were formulated and enacted over the period – from remarkably limited beginnings as small-scale vetting reform to a wide-ranging program of surveillance and counter-propaganda by the early 1960 s. And finally, whether such responses can be judged as proportional with the benefit of historical hindsight, or if the British government’s conduct should be regarded as an egregious example of reactionary censorship and infringement of civil liberties in the modern era...|$|E
