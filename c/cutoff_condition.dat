40|$|A {{method of}} {{implementing}} Saturn V lunar missions from an {{earth parking orbit}} is presented. The ground launch window is assumed continuous over a four and one-half hour period. The iterative guidance scheme combined {{with a set of}} auxiliary equations that define suitable S-IVB <b>cutoff</b> <b>conditions,</b> is the approach taken. The four inputs to the equations that define <b>cutoff</b> <b>conditions</b> are represented as simple third-degree polynomials as a function of ignition time. Errors at lunar arrival caused by the separate and combined effects of the guidance equations, <b>cutoff</b> <b>conditions,</b> hypersurface errors, and input representations are shown. Vehicle performance variations and parking orbit injection errors are included as perturbations. Appendix I explains how aim vectors were computed for the cutoff equations. Appendix II presents all guidance equations and related implementation procedures. Appendix III gives the derivation of the auxiliary cutoff equations. No error at lunar arrival was large enough to require a midcourse correction greater than one meter per second assuming a transfer time of three days and the midcourse correction occurs five hours after injection. Since this result is insignificant when compared to expected hardware errors, the implementation procedures presented are adequate to define <b>cutoff</b> <b>conditions</b> for Saturn V lunar missions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe study a {{model for}} a Lorentz non-invariant quantum field theory.

40|$|Gravitational redshifts of {{neutron stars}} have a {{theoretical}} upper limit of z= 0. 62. Also, {{it is generally}} believed that neutron stars have magnetic fields {{on the order of}} ten to the twelfth to ten to the thirteenth G. A previously predicted electromagnetic time dilation effect has been shown to correctly predict decay lifetimes of muons bound to atomic nuclei. In this paper it is shown that the electromagnetic time dilation effect, along with the gravitational time dilation effect, can produce total neutron star redshifts that are substantially larger than 0. 62. For instance, the redshift can cutoff radiation for B on the order of ten to the thirteenth G. Consequently, we can have a neutron star that is unobservable except for localized surface regions where the <b>cutoff</b> <b>condition</b> does not hold. Assuming coherent radiation, a surface region of this kind that does not include the star's rotation axis will emit a lighthouse type beam. Since the magnetic field in these regions will usually be strong enough to cause significant redshifts, {{and there is no reason}} to expect these regions to always be of constant size, shape, or field strength, this model explains the predominance of radio waves, and the existence of pulse variations, (e. g. nulling and drifting) in pulsars.
