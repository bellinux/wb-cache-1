40|$|As {{part of this}} study, laboratory- and pilot-scale washing of soils {{contaminated}} with Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn were performed. The soil washing agents used included strong acids (hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4)) and chelating agents (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid <b>calcium</b> <b>disodium</b> salt (<b>EDTA)</b> and citric acid (CA)). A positive correlation was observed between the removal efficiency of the washing process and the concentration of the washing solution. Moreover, the effect of H 2 SO 4 on metal removal with respect to concentration variations was more pronounced in the batch studies due mainly to acid dissolution of the heavy metals. Using H 2 SO 4 concentrations of between 300 and 1000 mM, the removal efficiencies achieved when targeting Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn and the total metal content were 41 – 42, 38 – 68, 23 – 25, 47 – 53, and 42 – 55 %. The removal efficiencies recorded during the engineering pilot scale washing of the field soils using H 2 SO 4 are comparable to those obtained in the batch study...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} {{ability of}} the calcium chelates of <b>calcium</b> <b>disodium</b> ethylenediaminetetraacetate (<b>EDTA)</b> and <b>calcium</b> trisodium ethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA) to protect mice against lethal doses of Clostridium perfringens α-toxin was investigated. Their protective ability was assayed by the increase in survival time of mice which had been given large doses of toxin, and by determining the median protective dose of chelate that would protect mice against toxin at a minimum lethal dose of two. In both assay procedures, intraperitoneal, intravenous, and intracutaneous injections of toxin were utilized, and with each toxin injection route the protective {{ability of the}} chelate was determined with the three routes of injection. DTPA was 10 to 20 times more effective than EDTA with both types of assay procedure and with all injection routes. DTPA may be superior to EDTA as a protective agent {{not only because it}} binds zinc to a greater extent, but also because of its greater retention in the body and its ability to gain entrance into cells.

40|$|Organic {{wines are}} prone to suffer from {{oxidative}} degradation due to the restrictions in the winemaking. This work studies the influence of different chemical routes, due to thermal and oxidative processes, in the wine aromatic profile.

Ascorbic acid, resveratrol, <b>calcium</b> <b>disodium</b> ethylenediaminetetraacetate (<b>EDTA),</b> sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and the polyphenols: gallic acid, epicatechin and caffeic acid, were tested. The oxidative estate by cyclic voltammetry, aromatic composition and general profiles and sensorial analysis were performed; obtaining interesting differences depending on the applied treatment. All samples gave a characteristic voltammetry signal; showing a remarkable decrease in the current intensity on those samples that suffer a deeper degradation. Regarding the chemical analysis results, {{the application of the}} metal chelator EDTA, apart from the SO 2 treatment, might be of interest to partly reduce the oxidative effect.

40|$|In this study, {{partially}} purified lysozyme {{was incorporated}} into zein films in combination with chickpea albumin extract (CPAE), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and <b>disodium</b> <b>EDTA.</b> The zein films showed an inherent free radical scavenging activity. Incorporation of lysozyme did not contribute to soluble free radical scavenging activity of zein films. However, the incorporation of lysozyme in combination with CPAE increased the soluble and immobilized free radical scavenging activity of zein films 17 % to 25 % and almost 84 %, respectively. The incorporation of CPAE also improved the distribution of partially purified lysozyme preparation in zein films and enabled the controlled release of lysozyme by reducing its release rate from zein films between 1. 5 - and 3. 5 -fold, depending on the concentration of incorporated CPAE.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} was to evaluate the bacterial survival rate on toothbrushes and efficacy of their decontamination by 4 % disodium ethyl diamine acetic acid [EDTA], 10 % sodium perborate and compared with control. Methods: Thirty subjects with chronic periodontitis enrolled in this randomized controlled clinical trial were provided with autoclaved toothbrushes which were free from microorganisms. Brushing instructions were given to each participant. Toothbrushes were collected from all study participants after 1 week and were placed with head down position in an autoclaved test tube containing sterile peptone water. Toothbrushes collected were sent for aerobic culture in laboratory for growth of micro-organisms. Incubation was done for 24 hours at 370 C. The toothbrushes were then divided into three groups and immersed in disinfectantslike 4 % <b>disodium</b> <b>EDTA,</b> 10 % sodium perborate and their efficacy was evaluated by aerobic culture analysis. Chi – Square test was used for statistical analysis of the data. Results: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas Aeroginosa, Streptococci and Klebsiella species were recovered from the samples.
