5000|$|Multi-function {{devices and}} Device Containers: Prior to Windows 7, every device {{attached}} to the system {{was treated as a}} single functional end-point, known as a devnode, that has a set of capabilities and a [...] "status". While this is appropriate for single-function devices (such as a keyboard or scanner), it does not accurately represent multi-function devices such as a combined printer, fax machine, and scanner, or web-cams with a built-in microphone. In Windows 7, the drivers and status information for multi-function device can be grouped together as a single [...] "Device Container", which is presented to the user in the new [...] "Devices and Printers" [...] Control Panel as a single unit. This capability is provided by a new Plug and Play property, , which is a Globally Unique Identifier that is different for every instance of a physical device. The <b>Container</b> <b>ID</b> can be embedded within the device by the manufacturer, or created by Windows and associated with each devnode when it is first connected to the computer. In order to ensure the uniqueness of the generated <b>Container</b> <b>ID,</b> Windows will attempt to use information unique to the device, such as a MAC address or USB serial number. Devices connected to the computer via USB, IEEE 1394 (FireWire), eSATA, PCI Express, Bluetooth, and Windows Rally's PnP-X support can make use of Device Containers.|$|E

40|$|A {{practical}} {{vision system}} called VECON for VEhicle and <b>CONtainer</b> <b>ID</b> number recognition {{is described in}} this thesis. A robust technique for character extraction is proposed. The preprocessing locates potential character regions using selective line segment filtering allowing fast focus on real ID numbers. The potential characters regions are extracted through successive projection segmentation. Then the characters are extracted by a multi-extraction module integrated with variable threshold binarization. The extracted characters are finally grouped, normalized, and fed into a backpropagation neural recognizer for recognition. After being tested on more than 2000 container images and 2000 vehicle images under real scene conditions, and used probationally in an international container terminal, in several container depots and at the HKUST entrance, the system {{has proven to be}} fast, effective, and accurate. The system is PC-based and no dedicated hardware is needed...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{threadworm}} Strongyloides stercoralis is endemic {{in settings}} where sanitary conditions {{are poor and}} where the climate is warm and humid. More than 70 tropical countries in Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, West Indies and Latin America are considered as high endemic settings. However, S. stercoralis is also prevalent in subtropical and temperate regions including Australia, Japan, Canada, United States and Europe. The global prevalence of S. stercoralis is heterogeneous. It is believed that about 30 - 100 million people worldwide are infected with S. stercoralis. But the true number and the global burden of infection remain unknown and most probably are today underestimating {{in many areas of}} the tropical resource poor countries. The low sensitivity of the currently available diagnostic tools and a scarcity of specialized survey are most important factors for that. Moreover, many epidemiological aspects of S. stercoralis infection are poorly understood or unknown. It is not known in detail where S. stercoralis is endemic, which infection rates and intensities can typically be expected in different settings and populations, and when an individual was infected at first-time and how quickly the re-infection can occur after successful treatment. Epidemiological information on S. stercoralis such as large-scale prevalence, re-infection, risk factors, clinical features and treatment efficacy are unknown in Cambodia and many parts of Southeast Asia. Aim and objectives: This PhD thesis aimed to understand the importance of S.  stercoralis infection in Cambodia by pursuing four main objectives: (i) assess S.  stercoralis infection and risk factors, validate diagnostic methods and determine treatment efficacy among schoolchildren, (ii) determine large-scale prevalence and risk factors in two socioeconomic and ecological distinctly different settings, (iii) determine re-infection rates among schoolchildren, and (iv) document clinical aspects of patients with high intensity of S. stercoralis infection in rural communities. Methods: School- and community-based studies were carried out in four primary schools and 120 villages of three provinces (Kandal, Preah Vihear and Takeo) in Cambodia, from 2009 to 2011. After obtaining the written informed consent from participants, an individual questionnaire was administrated to obtain demographic, risk-perception and behavioral data. The head of household was interviewed with a household questionnaire on socioeconomic indicators of the household such as house type, household assets, latrine and livestock. After the interview, each participant was given a pre-labeled plastic <b>container</b> (<b>ID</b> code, name, sex, age and date) for stool sample collection. In case a multiple stool samples analysis, another stool container was distributed upon collection of the first or second sample. The fecal materials were analyzed by Baermann method and Koga-agar plate (KAP) culture for diagnosing S.  stercoralis and Kato-Katz method for helminth co-infections. Two school-based studies were performed in four primary schools in Kandal province. In 2009, a cross-sectional study was carried out among 458 children, examining three fecal samples per child, to assess risk factors, diagnostic methods and treatment efficacy after three weeks of ivermectin treatment (100 ?g/kg/day for two days). A two-year cohort study was conducted among 302 schoolchildren from 2009 to 2011, analyzing two stool samples per child, to determine re-infection and risk factors of S. stercoralis. Two large-scale cross-sectional community-based studies were conducted in 2010 and 2011 to assess infection prevalence and risk factors in two provinces (2396 participants from 60 villages of Preah Vihear province, analyzed two stool samples per participant; and 2861 participants from 60 villages of Takeo province, examined one stool sample per participant). Bayesian kriging was used to predict risk at non-surveyed locations in Preah Vihear province. A case-series study, nested in the survey in Preah Vihear province in 2010, was carried out to document the clinical features of 21 S. stercoralis cases, with high numbers of S.  stercoralis larvae in their fecal specimen detected by Baermann technique. Principal findings: A cross-sectional school-based survey in 2009 found that 24. 4...|$|E

40|$|The "VacuSIP ” is a {{simplification}} of the SIP system {{developed by}} Yahel et al. (2007), {{and it is}} considerably cheaper and adapted for SCUBA base work. The system was originally designed after Wright and Stephens (1978) and Riisgård (1991) for direct in situ sampling of the rates and efficiencies by which suspension feeders remove (or discharge) substances from (to) the water they filter. Nevertheless, VacuSIPs can be used wherever a controlled and clean, point-source water sample is required. A simple valve operation or needle piercing by a SCUBA diver allows the external water pressure to force the sampled water into an evacuated sample <b>container.</b> The small <b>ID</b> of the tubing (usually 20 - 50 μm PEEK) insures controlled suction rate during the sampling (see below) and a negligible dead volume. Fig. 1. A pair of VacuSIPs is used for simultaneous sampling of the water inhaled and exhaled by a solitary ascidian (Micrcosmus exasperatus). East Mediterranean, 10 m depth. For in situ sampling of suspension feeders metabolism, the pumping activity of each specimen sampled is first visualized by releasing fluorescein dyed seawater next to the inhalant orifice(s) and then observing it flow from the excurrent (e. g. Fig. 2 B in Yahel et al. 2007); then the water inhaled and exhaled by the studied specimen (incurrent and excurrent) ar...|$|R
