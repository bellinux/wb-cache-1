5|$|In November 2012, the Pakistan {{government}} {{in response to}} the court orders, finally wrote to the Swiss authorities seeking to reopen the <b>corruption</b> cases against Zardari.

We construct a constrained sparse regression problem that enforces both Lambertian, rank- 3 structure and sparse, additive <b>corruptions.</b> A solution method is derived using a hierarchical Bayesian approximation to accurately estimate the surface normals while simultaneously separating the non-Lambertian <b>corruptions.</b> Extensive evaluations are performed that show state-of-the-art performance using both synthetic and real-world images. 1...|$|R

5|$|Morales' {{government}} also introduced measures to tackle Bolivia's endemic corruption; in 2007, {{he used a}} presidential decree to create the Ministry of Institutional Transparency and Fight Against <b>Corruption.</b> However, critics highlighted that MAS members were rarely prosecuted for the crime, the main exception being YPFB head Santos Ramírez, who was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment for <b>corruption</b> in 2008. Conversely, a 2009 law that permitted the retroactive prosecution for <b>corruption</b> led to legal cases being brought against a number of opposition politicians for alleged <b>corruption</b> in the pre-Morales period; many fled abroad to avoid standing trial.|$|E

5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} {{he took to}} reform {{the government of the}} empire have been praised by historians. In the provinces, Andronikos' reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. Andronikos's fierce determination to root out <b>corruption</b> and many other abuses was admirable; under Andronikos, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. Every form of <b>corruption</b> was eliminated with ferocious zeal.|$|E

5|$|As in {{many other}} African societies, prebendalism and high rates of <b>corruption</b> {{continue}} to constitute major challenges to Nigeria. All major parties have practised vote rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive. In 1983, the policy institute at Kuru concluded that only the 1959 and 1979 elections to that time were conducted with minimal vote rigging. In 2012, Nigeria was estimated to have lost over $400 billion to <b>corruption</b> since independence.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon {{is viewed}} as rife with <b>corruption</b> {{at all levels of}} government. In 1997, Cameroon {{established}} anti-corruption bureaus in 29 ministries, but only 25% became operational, and in 2012, Transparency International placed Cameroon at number 144 on a list of 176 countries ranked from least to most corrupt. On 18 January 2006, Biya initiated an anti-corruption drive {{under the direction of the}} National Anti-Corruption Observatory. There are several high <b>corruption</b> risk areas in Cameroon, for instance, customs, public health sector and public procurement.|$|E

In this work, we present an efficient fault-tolerance approach against hardware faults by exploiting the new extensions to the x 86 architecture. In particular, we propose that Intel MPX can be effectively used to detect faults in data pointers, while Intel TSX can provide roll-back recovery against these <b>corruptions.</b> Our preliminary evaluation supports this hypothesis, and we estimate the average overhead to be roughly around 50 %...|$|R

5|$|In 1976, {{there were}} 337 indictments {{of state and}} local {{officials}} for public <b>corruption,</b> compared to 63 in 1970. Between 1970 and 1981, there were 520 federal indictments of state officials, and 1,757 indictments of local officials, for public corruption; over that period, 369 state officials, and 1,290 local officials, were convicted. In 1986, there were 916 indictments of public officials for <b>corruption,</b> 320 of which concerned state and local officials. In 1990, there were 968 such indictments, 353 of which were against state and local officials.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, the Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the National Reconciliation Ordinance amnesty was unconstitutional, which {{cleared the way for}} the revival of <b>corruption</b> cases against Zardari. Though Zardari had {{immunity}} from prosecution because he was President, the end of NRO and his earlier <b>corruption</b> cases challenged the legality of his presidency. Calls for his resignation escalated. Zardari, who rarely left the Aiwan-e-Sadr presidential palace, responded with a nationwide spurt of speeches in January 2011. In January 2010, the Supreme Court ordered Pakistan's government to reopen Zardari's <b>corruption</b> charges in Switzerland. However, Zardari prevented the MQM-leaning Attorney General, Anwar Mansoor, from filing charges, so Mansoor resigned in protest in early April. That same month, Zardari won a key victory against the judiciary over his <b>corruption</b> trials when Geneva Attorney General Daniel Zappelli stated that Zardari can not be prosecuted under international laws because of his presidential immunity. Zardari was supported by Prime Minister Gilani, who defied the Supreme Court order.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{techniques}} {{based on}} Sparse Representation (SR) have demonstrated promising performance on high-level visual recognition, {{exemplified by the}} high-accuracy face recognition under occlusions and other sparse <b>corruptions</b> [1]. Most {{research in this area}} has focused on classification algorithms using raw image pixels, and very few have been proposed to utilize the quantized visual features, such as the popular Bagof- Words (BOW) feature abstraction. In such cases, besides the inherent quantization errors, ambiguity associated with visual word assignment and mis-detection of feature points due to factors such as visual occlusions and noises, constitutes the major causes to the dense <b>corruptions</b> of the quantized representation. The dense <b>corruptions</b> can jeopardize the decision process by distorting the patterns of the sparse reconstruction coefficients. In this paper, we aim to eliminate the <b>corruptions</b> and achieve Robust Image Analysis with SR (RIASR). Towards this goal, we introduce two transfer processes (ambiguity transfer and mis-detection transfer) to account for the two major sources of <b>corruptions</b> as discussed. By reasonably assuming the rarity of the two kinds of distortion processes, we augment the original SR-based reconstruction objective with ` 0 -norm regularization on the transfer terms to encourage sparsity and hence discourage dense distortion/transfer. Computationally, we relax the nonconvex ` 0 -norm optimization into a convex ` 1 -norm optimization problem, and employ the Accelerated Proximal Gradient (APG) method to optimize by a convergence provable updating procedure. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, Caltech- 101, Caltech- 256, Corel- 5 k, and CMU PIE, manifest the necessity of removing the quantization <b>corruptions</b> and the various advantages of the proposed framework...|$|R

The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act's object, which is to address acts of <b>corruption</b> taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it. The exclusion of non-citizens from the ambit of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations.|$|E
