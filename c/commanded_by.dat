40|$|Abstract: If God {{commanded}} {{something that}} was obviously evil, would we have {{a moral obligation to}} do it? I critically examine three radically different approaches divine-command theorists may take to the problem posed by this question: (l) reject the possibility of such a <b>command</b> <b>by</b> appealing to God's essential goodness; (2) avoid the implication that we should obey such a <b>command</b> <b>by</b> modifying the divine-command theory; and (3) accept the implication that we should obey such a <b>command</b> <b>by</b> appealing to divine transcendence and mystery. I show that each approach faces significant challenges, and that none is completely satisfying...|$|R
