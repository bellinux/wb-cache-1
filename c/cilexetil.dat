40|$|Objective: Objective of {{the study}} was to develop a simple, accurate, precise, economic, robust and rugged UV {{spectrophotometric}} method and validate for the simultaneous estimation of Candesartan <b>Cilexetil</b> and Pioglitazone Hydrochloride in synthetic mixture. Methods: Combination of Candesartan <b>Cilexetil</b> and Pioglitazone Hydrochloride has only one LC-MS/MS analytical method developed yet, so this UV method was novel for combined synthetic dosage of Candesartan <b>Cilexetil</b> and Pioglitazone Hydrochloride (1 : 2). This method utilizes methanol as a solvent. Zero crossing point (ZCP) of Candesartan <b>Cilexetil</b> and Pioglitazone hydrochloride were found to be 242. 00 nm and 327. 60 nm respectively. Hence, estimation of Candesartan <b>Cilexetil</b> and Pioglitazone Hydrochloride were done at 327. 60 nm and 242. 00 nm respectively. Results: The linearity of Candesartan <b>Cilexetil</b> and Pioglitazone Hydrochloride were found to be in range 10 - 50 μg/ml and 20 - 100 μg/ml (R 2 = 0. 9995) respectively.

40|$|The {{addition}} of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> (Atacand(R), Amias(R), Blopress(R), Kenzen(R), Ratacand(R)) to standard therapy for chronic heart failure (CHF) provided important clinical benefits at {{little or no}} additional cost in France, Germany and the UK, according to a detailed economic analysis focusing on major cardiovascular events and prospectively collected resource-use data from the CHARM-Added and CHARM-Alternative trials in patients with CHF and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. Results of a corresponding cost-effectiveness analysis showed that candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> was either dominant over placebo or was associated with small incremental costs per life-year gained, depending on the country and whether individual trial or pooled data were used. Preliminary data from a US cost-effectiveness analysis based on CHARM data also showed favourable results for candesartan <b>cilexetil.</b> Two cost-effectiveness analyses of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> in hypertension have been published, both conducted in Sweden. Data from the SCOPE trial in elderly patients with hypertension, which showed {{a significant reduction in}} nonfatal stroke with candesartan cilexetil-based therapy versus non-candesartan cilexetil-based treatment, were incorporated into a Markov model and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of _ 12 _ 824 per QALY gained was calculated (2001 value). Another modelled cost-effectiveness analysis of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> was based on the ALPINE trial, in which the incidence of new-onset diabetes was significantly lower in patients with newly diagnosed hypertension who were randomised to candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> (with or without felodipine) than among those who received hydrochlorothiazide (with or without atenolol). Although candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> was dominant over hydrochlorothiazide, the ALPINE cost-effectiveness analysis relied on a small number of clinical events and did not evaluate the incremental cost of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> per life-year or QALY gained. In conclusion, despite some inherent limitations, economic analyses incorporating CHARM data and conducted primarily in Europe have shown that candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> appears to be cost effective when added to standard CHF treatment in patients with CHF and compromised LV systolic function. The use of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> as part of antihypertensive therapy in elderly patients with elevated blood pressure was also deemed to be cost effective in a Swedish analysis, primarily resulting from a reduced risk of nonfatal stroke (as shown in the SCOPE study); however, the generalisability of results to other contexts has not been established. Cost-effectiveness analyses comparing candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> with ACE inhibitors or other angiotensin receptor blockers in CHF or hypertension are lacking, and results reported for candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> in a Swedish economic analysis of ALPINE data focusing on outcomes for diabetes require confirmation and extension.

40|$|Established primary {{hypertension}} {{is primarily}} characterised by elevated peripheral resistance {{and an increase}} in renal vascular resistance. Antagonism of angiotensin II may be a particularly relevant intervention in this condition, as angiotensin II is known to act both as a powerful vasoconstrictor and as a stimulus to vascular hyperthrophy. The aims of this study were to: - evaluate the acute and long-term effects of 16 mg candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> o. d., an angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor blocker, on systemic and renal haemodynamics and RAAS hormones in patients with mild and moderate hypertension, - assess the long-term effects on forearm haemodynamics and baroreceptor sensitivity and, finally, - compare the effects of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> 16 mg with the effects of losartan 50 mg and valsartan 80 mg on blood pressure, renal haemodynamics and RAAS hormones before and during intravenous angiotensin II infusion. Blood pressure was assessed intra-arterially and by ordinary mercury manometer. Cardiac output was measured using the dye dilution technique in the acute and long-term study. In the comparison between AT 1 receptor blockers, blood pressure was assessed with an ordinary mercury manometer. Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were obtained from PAH and 51 CrEDTA clearance and forearm blood flow by mercury strain gauge plethysmography. Baroreceptor sensitivity was calculated from beat-to-beat changes in systolic blood pressure and heart rate. A single oral dose of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> induced systemic and renal vasodilation and blood pressure reduction without compromising renal perfusion or filtration or affecting cardiac perfomance. Long-term treatment with candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> o. d. induced systemic, forearm and renal vasodilation and a blood pressure reduction. As in the acute study, candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> induced a reduction in renal vascular resistance. The glomerular filtration rate was maintained and the filtration fraction was reduced, indicating a decreased glomerular capillary pressure. The baroreceptor sensitivity was not influenced by candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> but the operational set point was shifted to the left. In the comparative study, candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> 16 mg o. d. reduced resting blood pressure significantly more than losartan 50 mg o. d. and valsartan 80 mg o. d. Candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> almost completely inhibited the exogenous angiotensin II-induced renal vasoconstriction, effectively inhibited the increase in filtration fraction and significantly blunted aldosterone secretion compared with losartan and valsartan, indicating a more effective AT 1 receptor blockade with candesartan <b>cilexetil.</b> In conclusion, candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> is a vasodilator providing long-term blood pressure control without initial reflex tachycardia. Long-term renal adaptation is characterised by a reduction in filtration fraction. The superior blood pressure control and more pronounced inhibition of exogenous angiotensin II-induced effects with candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> compared with losartan and valsartan might be explained by the binding properties of candesartan <b>cilexetil,</b> especially the slow dissociation from the receptor...|$|E

30|$|Candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> is an ester prodrug {{antagonist}} to angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT 1) used {{in management}} of many cardiovascular diseases. The absolute bioavailability of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> is about (14 – 40 %). Therefore, the paper {{aim was to}} prepare and evaluate solid self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems for candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> {{in order to improve}} its solubility, dissolution and stability. Solubility study was run in different vehicles to select the best excipients for dissolving candesartan <b>cilexetil.</b> Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed at 1 : 1, 2 : 1, 3 : 1 and 4 : 1 ratios and four formulations were prepared using various concentrations of cinnamon oil, tween 80 with poloxamer 407 mixture and transcutol HP as oil, surfactant mixture and co-surfactant, respectively. After this step about (0.2 milliliter) of each formulation was adsorbed on to two different adsorbent mixtures set which were: avicel 101 with aerosil 200 and avicel 101 with dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous resulted in eight solid nanoformulations. All prepared formulations were evaluated for particle size distribution, polydispersity index, zeta potential, scanning probe microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffractometry and in vitro drug dissolution. It was found that release rate and extent for all prepared formulations were significantly higher (p[*]<[*] 0.05) than marketed tablet as well as plain drug powder. It could be concluded from the study that self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system is a promising approach to improve solubility, wettability, dissolution and stability of candesartan <b>cilexetil.</b>|$|E
40|$|Effect of {{candesartan}} <b>cilexetil</b> (TCV- 116) in rats {{with chronic}} renal failure. BackgroundInhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by both angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (AT 1 As) and angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) shows renoprotective effects in rats with {{chronic renal failure}} when treatment is started in the early phase of renal injury. In this study, we examined the renal protective effects of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> (TCV- 116), an AT 1 A, and enalapril, an ACEI, in the progressive phase of renal injury in 5 / 6 nephrectomized rats. MethodsCandesartan <b>cilexetil</b> (1 mg/kg/day) and enalapril (10 mg/kg/day) were orally administered once a day for 4 weeks (the short-term experiment) or 16 weeks (the long-term experiment) to 5 / 6 nephrectomized rats beginning 15 weeks after the nephrectomy, that is, after they had already showed marked proteinuria. ResultsIn vehicle-treated rats, proteinuria, glomerulosclerosis, and interstitial fibrosis developed. Moreover, enhanced expression of transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) in the injured glomeruli was observed. These adverse changes progressed with time, and in the short-term experiment, both drugs inhibited them. In the long-term experiment, the progressive proteinuria and the {{elevation of blood pressure}} were similarly attenuated by both drugs. However, candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> significantly inhibited the progression of glomerulosclerosis, the expression of TGF-β 1, and interstitial fibrosis, whereas enalapril did not. ConclusionThese results indicate that candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> shows potent and long-term preventive effects against the progression of previously developed renal injury...|$|E
40|$|Several {{angiotensin}} II receptor blockers (ARB) {{are currently}} {{available for the}} treatment of hypertension. These drugs share a common mechanism of action—antagonism of angiotensin II AT 1 receptors; however, their receptor binding kinetics differ. Candesartan has a higher affinity for the AT 1 receptor than all the other ARB. In addition, candesartan and irbesartan block the AT 1 receptor with insurmountable antagonism, whereas losartan, valsartan, and eprosartan are competitive antagonists. The pharmacokinetics of these ARB also differ in terms of oral bioavailability, rate of absorption, metabolism, and route and rate of elimination. Both losartan potassium and candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> are prodrugs; however, losartan is partially converted into EXP 3174 in the liver, whereas candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> is converted completely into candesartan during gastrointestinal absorption. On the basis of elimination half-lives, losartan, valsartan, and eprosartan may be classified as shorter acting and candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> and irbesartan as longer acting. Each drug effectively lowers blood pressure during once daily administration to patients with mild to moderate hypertension, with candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> requiring the lowest dosage and providing dose-dependent efficacy. Initial comparative clinical trials suggest that both candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> and irbesartan in the doses used are significantly more effective than losartan in lowering trough sitting diastolic blood pressure. It remains to be determined, however, whether the observed pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic differences among the members of the ARB class will have a clinically significant impact on long-term cardiovascular outcomes and reductions of cardiovascular mortality.

30|$|Nanoemulsion is {{considered}} to be a new and exciting field of research that seeks to exploit the attractive properties of components to improve oral delivery of drugs like candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> used in the management of chronic diseases. Candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> is a lipophilic acidic drug with a half-life of about (5 – 10) hour and absolute bioavailability of (14 – 40 %). For this reason, the study target was to formulate and characterize candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> nanoemulsions that could improve solubility, dissolution and stability of the lipophilic drug candesartan <b>cilexetil.</b> The solubility of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> was checked in various vehicles in order to choose the best solubilizing components for building up an efficient nanoemulsion based on regulating hydrophilic/lipophilic balance (HLB) value above 10, and then pseudo-ternary phase diagram was used as a useful tool to evaluate the nanoemulsion domain. The nanoemulsion formulations were prepared using various concentrations of cinnamon oil, tween 80 with poloxamer mixture and transcutol HP as oil, surfactant mixture and co-surfactant respectively by aqueous titration method at surfactant/co-surfactant ratios of 3 : 1 and 4 : 1 and varying the type of poloxamer in each ratio. The prepared nanoemulsions were tested for nanodispersion stability studies, droplet size distribution, polydispersity index, zeta potential, viscosity, filter paper spreadability, dye miscibility, electroconductivity, pH, percent transmittance, surface tension, refractive index, morphology and drug dissolution. It was found that release rate and extent for all prepared nanoformulations were significantly higher (p[*]<[*] 0.05) than marketed tablet formulation as well as plain drug powder.|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{sensitive}} gradient rapid resolution liquid chromatographic {{assay method}} {{has been developed}} for the quantitative determination of Candesartan <b>Cilexetil</b> in bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient, used {{for the treatment of}} hypertension. The developed method is also applicable for the process related impurities determination. Efficient chromatographic separation was achieved on a C 18 stationary phase with simple mobile phase combination delivered in a gradient mode and quantification was by ultraviolet detection at 210 nm at a flow rate of 0. 4 mL × min﹣ 1 . In the developed UPLC method the resolution between Candesartan <b>Cilexetil</b> and its two potential impurities was found to be greater than 2. 0. Regression analysis showed an r value (correlation coefficient) greater than 0. 99 for Candesartan <b>Cilexetil</b> and its two impurities. This method was capable to detect two impurities of Candesartan <b>Cilexetil</b> at a level of 0. 003 % with respect to test concentration of 1. 0 mg × mL﹣ 1 for a 2 μL injection volume. The bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient was subjected to stress conditions of hydrolysis, oxidation, photolysis and thermal degradation. Considerable degradation was found to occur in oxidative stress conditions. The stress samples were assayed against a qualified reference standard and the mass balance was found close to 99. 5 %. The developed RP-LC method was validated with respect to linearity, accuracy, precision and robustness...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac AT 2 R {{expression}} is upregulated {{in the normal}} process of aging. In this study we determined the contribution of AT 2 R to chronic antihypertensive and remodelling effects of AT 1 R blockade in aged hypertensive rats. Adult (20 weeks) and senescent (20 months) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were treated with either the AT 1 R antagonist, candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> (2 [*]mg/kg/day), the AT 2 R antagonist, PD 123319 (10 [*]mg/kg/day), {{or a combination of}} the 2 compounds. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and left ventricular volume were markedly decreased by candesartan <b>cilexetil,</b> however, simultaneous treatment with PD 123319 had no additional effect on either parameter. Perivascular fibrosis was significantly reduced by candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> in aged animals only, and this effect was reversed by concomitant PD 123319 administration. Vascular hypertrophy was reduced by candesartan <b>cilexetil,</b> and these effects were reversed by simultaneous PD 123319. These results suggest that AT 2 R stimulation does not significantly influence the antihypertensive effect of chronic AT 1 R blockade, but plays a role in the regulation of vascular structure. The severe degree of cardiac perivascular fibrosis in senescent animals was regressed by AT 1 R blockade and this effect was reversed by simultaneous AT 2 R inhibition, demonstrating an antifibrotic role of AT 2 R stimulation in the aging hypertensive heart...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin II (Ang II) {{receptor}} blockers are {{the newest}} class of antihypertensive drugs to be developed. No large-scale clinical trials {{have been performed}} to evaluate their efficacy alone, or {{in combination with other}} drugs. A large-scale, eight week, open-label, non-placebo-controlled, single-arm trial evaluated the efficacy, tolerability and dose-response of candesartan <b>cilexetil,</b> 16 — 32 mg once-daily, either as monotherapy or as part of combination therapy, in a diverse hypertensive population in actual practice settings. 6465 patients with high blood pressure, of whom 52 % were female and 16 % African American, {{with a mean age of}} 58 years, were included. 5446 patients had essential hypertension and 1014 patients had isolated systolic hypertension. In order to be included in this study, patients had either untreated or uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 — 179 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 — 109 mmHg inclusive at baseline), despite a variety of other antihypertensive drugs. Of the 5156 patients with essential hypertension and at least one post baseline efficacy measurement, the mean pretreatment blood pressure (BP) was 156 / 97 mmHg. Candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> monotherapy reduced mean SBP/DBP by 18. 0 / 12. 2 mmHg. Similarly, in the 964 patients with isolated systolic hypertension and at least one post baseline efficacy measurement, candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> monotherapy reduced SBP/DBP from 158 / 81 by 16. 5 / 4. 5 mmHg. Candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> was similarly effective when employed as add-on therapy. When added to baseline antihypertensive medication in 51 % of the patients with essential hypertension not achieving BP control, additional reduction in BP was achieved regardless of the background therapy, including diuretics (17. 8 / 11. 7 mmHg) calcium antagonists (16. 6 / 11. 2 mmHg), beta-blockers (16. 5 / 10. 4 mmHg), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) (15. 3 / 10. 0 mmHg), and alpha blockers (16. 4 / 10. 4 mmHg). Likewise, when candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> was used as add-on therapy in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, there was a consistent further reduction of mean SBP/DBP, regardless of the background therapy. Moreover, these monotherapeutic or add-on efficacy benefits were seen regardless of age (65 years), gender, or race. Despite the open-label design of the study which enhances efficacy owing to the placebo effect, the Ang II receptor blocker, candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> either alone, or as an add-on therapy, is highly effective for assisting in the control of systolic and diastolic hypertension...|$|E
40|$|Five {{clinical}} studies {{were conducted to}} investigate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> in patients with either normal or impaired renal or hepatic function. Participants in these open-label, single- or parallel-group prospective studies were administered candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> 8 or 12 mg as a single oral dose and then, {{in all but one}} study, as a repeated once-daily oral dose regimen. A total of 94 patients of either gender aged between 18 and 75 years with normal or mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction (Study I) and normal or mild to moderate/severe renal dysfunction (Studies 2 - 5) were included. Subjects recruited to all studies evaluating the effect of renal impairment also had some degree of hypertension. Patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment showed no significant differences in the key plasma pharmacokinetic parameters or plasma protein binding profile of candesartan compared with healthy volunteers. In patients with mild to moderate or severe renal impairment there were significant increases in the maximum plasma concentration, area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve and elimination half-life of candesartan and its inactive metabolite (CV- 15959) when compared to volunteers with normal renal function following repeated administration of candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> 8 or 12 mg. However, {{there was no evidence of}} accumulation following treatment with the 8 mg dose apart from those with severe disease requiring dialysis. Nevertheless, dialysis itself did not appear to affect the pharmacokinetic profile of candesartan or that of CV- 15959. C Candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> was found to have a good safety profile and to be well tolerated by patients with hepatic or renal impairment. There were no clinically relevant changes detected in vital signs, laboratory safety parameters or in ECG readings. The most common adverse events were headache and dizziness. This series of studies show that candesartan <b>cilexetil</b> 8 mg once daily is suitable for administration to patients with mild to moderate renal or hepatic impairment with no need for additional dose adjustment. A lower starting dose may be appropriate in patients with severe renal impairment including those requiring dialysis...|$|E
