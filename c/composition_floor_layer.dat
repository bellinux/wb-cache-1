40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{described}} {{an increased risk}} of developing tibio-femoral osteoarthritis (TF OA), meniscal tears and bursitis among those with a trade as <b>floor</b> <b>layers.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyse symptomatic knee disorders among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> that were highly exposed to kneeling work tasks compared to graphic designers without knee-demanding work tasks. Methods Data on the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) were collected by questionnaires. In total 134 <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> and 120 graphic designers had a bilateral radiographic knee examination to detect TF OA and patella-femoral (PF) OA. A random sample of 92 <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> and 49 graphic designers had Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of both knees to examine meniscal tears. Means of the subscales of KOOS were compared by analysis of variance. The risk ratio of symptomatic knee disorders defined as a combination of radiological detected knee OA or MRI-detected meniscal tears combined with a low KOOS score was estimated by logistic regression in <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> with 95 % confidence interval (CI) and adjusted for age, body mass index, traumas, and knee-straining sports activities. Symptomatic knee OA or meniscal tears were defined as a combination of low KOOS-scores and radiographic or MRI pathology. Results Symptomatic TF and medial meniscal tears were found in <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> compared to graphic designers with odds ratios 2. 6 (95 %CI 0. 99 - 6. 9) and 2. 04 (95 % CI 0. 77 - 5. 5), respectively. There were no differences in PF OA. <b>Floor</b> <b>layers</b> scored significantly lower on all KOOS subscales compared to graphic designers. Significantly lower scores on the KOOS subscales were also found for radiographic TF and PF OA regardless of trade but not for meniscal tears. Conclusions The study showed an overall increased risk of developing symptomatic TF OA in a group of <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> with a substantial amount of kneeling work positions. Prevention would be appropriate to reduce the proportion of kneeling postures e. g. by working with tools used from a standing working position. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{the risk of}} intra- and periarticular cyst-like lesions of the knee joint in occupational kneeling. Methods. Magnetic resonance imaging of both knees (n = 282) was conducted in 92 male <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> and 49 male graphic designers (referents), {{with a mean age}} of 55. 6 years (range 42 – 70 years). The prevalence of cyst-like lesions was computed among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> and graphic designers, respectively, and associations with occupation summarized by odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Using logistic regression, models were adjusted for age, body mass index, knee injuries, and knee-straining sports. Results. <b>Floor</b> <b>layers</b> had a significantly higher prevalence of cyst-like lesions in the posterior part of the knee joint compared to graphic designers (OR 2. 70, 95 % CI 1. 50 – 4. 84). <b>Floor</b> <b>layers</b> also had a higher prevalence of fluid collections in the popliteus tendon recess (OR 2. 17, 95 % CI 0. 99 – 4. 77) and large cystic lesions of the popliteus muscle (OR 3. 83, 95 % CI 0. 78 – 18. 89). The prevalence of cystic lesions in the anterior part of the knee joint was low among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> (8. 7 %) and there was no significant difference between the two trade groups (P = 0. 34).

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{prevalence}} of self-reported and clinical knee morbidity among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> compared to a group of graphic designers, with special attention to meniscal status. Methods We obtained information about knee complaints by questionnaire and conducted a bilateral clinical and radiographic knee examination in 134 male <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> and 120 male graphic designers. After the exclusion of subjects with reports of earlier knee injuries the odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of knee complaints and clinical findings were computed among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> compared to graphic designers, using logistic regression. Estimates were adjusted for effects of body mass index, age and knee straining sports. Using radiographic evaluations, we conducted side-specific sensitivity analyses regarding clinical signs of meniscal lesions after the exclusion of participants with tibiofemoral (TF) osteoarthritis (OA). Results Reports of knee pain (OR = 2. 7, 95 % CI = 1. 5 – 4. 6), pain during stair walking (OR = 2. 2, 95 % CI = 1. 3 – 3. 9) and symptoms of catching of the knee joint (OR = 2. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 4 – 5. 7) were more prevalent among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> compared to graphic designers. Additionally, significant more <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> than graphic designers had clinical signs suggesting possible meniscal lesions: a positive McMurray test (OR = 2. 4, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 5. 0) and TF joint line tenderness (OR = 5. 4, 95 % CI = 2. 4 – 12. 0). Excluding <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> (n = 22) and graphic designers (n = 15) with radiographic TF OA did not alter this trend between the two study groups: a positive McMurray test (OR = 2. 2, 95 % CI = 1. 0 – 4. 9), TF joint line tenderness (OR = 5. 0, 95 % CI = 2. 0 – 12. 5). Conclusion Results indicate that <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> have a high prevalence of both self-reported and clinical knee morbidity. Clinical knee findings suggesting possible meniscal lesions were significant more prevalent among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> compared to a group of low-level exposed graphic designers and an association with occupational kneeling could be possible.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine if knee {{complaints}} among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> predict exclusion from the trade. Methods In 1994 / 95 self-reported data were obtained from a cohort of <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> and graphic designers with and without knee straining work activities, respectively. At follow-up in 2005 the questionnaire survey was repeated. The study population consisted of 81 <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> and 173 graphic designers who were presently working in their trades at baseline (1995). All participants were men aged 36 – 70 years in 2005. We computed the risk of losing gainful employment in the trade according to occurrence of knee complaints at baseline, using Cox proportional hazard regression adjusted for a number of potential confounding variables. Moreover, the crude and adjusted odds risk ratio for knee complaints according to status of employment in the trade were computed, using graphic designers as reference. Results A positive but non-significant association between knee complaints lasting more than 30 days the past 12 months and exclusion from the trade was found among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> (Hazard Ratio = 1. 4, 95 % CI = 0. 6 – 3. 5). The frequency of self-reported knee complaints was lower among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> presently at work in the trade in year 2005 (26. 3 %) compared with baseline in 1995 (41. 1 %), while the opposite tendency was seen among graphic designers (20. 7 % vs. 10. 7 %). Conclusion The study suggests that knee complaints are a risk factor for premature exclusion from a knee demanding trade. However, low power of the study precludes strong conclusions. The study also indicates a healthy worker effect among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> and a survivor effect among graphic designers. </p...|$|R

The outcome measures were work demands, production time, perceived load, discomfort and applicability. Compared to the self-propelled machine, the duration of kneeling (∆ 13 min; p = 0. 003) and trunk flexion (∆ 12 min; p < 0. 001) was shorter using the manually moved machine, and the duration of pushing and pulling increased (∆ 39 min; p < 0. 001). No significant or relevant differences were found for production time, perceived load and discomfort. Nine out of ten <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> found the manually moved machine applicable and three out of ten found the self-propelled machine applicable.

40|$|Screed {{floors are}} bound by sand-cement (SF) or by {{anhydrite}} (AF). Sand-cement floors are levelled manually and anhydrite floors are self-levelling and therefore differences in work demands and prevalences of musculoskeletal complaints might occur. The objective was to assess among SF layers and AF layers (1) the prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints and (2) the physical work demands, energetic workload, perceived workload and discomfort. A questionnaire survey and an observational field study were performed. Compared with AF layers (n = 35), SF layers (n = 203) had higher, however, not statistically significant different, prevalences of neck (20 % vs. 7 %), shoulder (27 % vs. 13 %), low back (39 % vs. 26 %) and ankles/feet (9 % vs. 0 %) complaints. Sand-cement-bound screed <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> (n = 18) bent and kneeled significantly longer (Δ 77 min and Δ 94 min; respectively), whereas AF layers (n = 18) stood significantly longer (Δ 60 min).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to evaluate the association between occupational kneeling and compartment specific radiographic tibiofemoral (TF) and patellofemoral (PF) osteoarthritis (OA). Methods Questionnaire data and bilateral knee radiographs were obtained in 134 male <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> and 120 male graphic designers (referents). Weight-bearing radiographs in three views (postero-anterior, lateral and axial) were classified according to joint space narrowing. After the exclusion of subjects with reports of earlier knee injuries the odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of TF and PF OA was computed among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> compared to graphic designers in three age groups (≤ 49; 50 – 59; ≥ 60 years). Using logistic regression, estimates were adjusted for body mass index and knee-straining sports. In addition, the association between trade seniority and TF OA was assessed in age-adjusted test for trend analyses. Results The prevalence of TF OA was significantly higher among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> aged 50 – 59 years compared to graphic designers (OR = 3. 6, 95 % CI = 1. 1 – 12. 0) while non-significant estimates {{were found in the}} young and elderly age groups. Furthermore, the adjusted OR of TF OA increased with trade seniority among <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> (test for trend, OR = 2. 2, 95 % CI = 1. 0 – 5. 1), but not among graphic designers (OR = 1. 2, 95 % CI = 0. 4 – 3. 5). There were no significant differences regarding PF OA between the two occupational groups. Conclusion Results corroborate the existence of a causal relationship between occupational kneeling and radiographic TF OA and suggest a dose-response association with trade seniority. An association between kneeling and PF OA was however doubtful. Apparent discrepancies between findings in different age groups are most likely reflecting selection bias. </p...|$|R

MethodsHealth insurance claims between 2006 and 2010 from <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> were frequency matched by age, gender, eligibility time, and geographic location to claims from insured workers in general industry obtained from MarketScan. We extracted MSD claims and dates of service from six regions of the body: neck, low back, knee, lower extremity, shoulder, and distal arm, and evaluated differences in claim rates. ResultsFifty-one percent of <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> (n= 1, 475) experienced musculoskeletal claims compared to 39 % of MarketScan members (p< 0. 001). Claim rates were higher for <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> across all body regions with nearly double the rate ratios for the knee and neck regions (RR: 2. 10 and 2. 07). The excess risk was greatest for the neck and low back regions; younger workers had disproportionately higher rates in the knee, neck, low back, and distal arm. A larger proportion of <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> (22 %) filed MSD claims {{in more than one}} body region compared to general workers (10 %; p< 0. 001). ConclusionsFloor layers have markedly higher rates of MSD claims compared to a general worker population, suggesting shifting of medical costs for work-related MSD to personal health insurance. The occurrence of disorders in multiple body regions and among the youngest workers highlights the need for improved work methods and tools for construction workers.

Continuous direct measurements of postures were linked to real-time observations of tasks and external forces applied during manual materials handling. A self-administered questionnaire on musculoskeletal complaints was used. The introduction of a hydraulic clamp or vacuum lift to assist roadmakers while laying a brick-paved road reduced the team's work time in a kneeling/squatting position with 43 - 52 % and frequency of lifting loads of 5 - 15 kg and above 15 kg with 46 - 59 % and 84 - 88 %, respectively. The introduction of a mixing machine with a pump system during pouring of sand-cement floors reduced the frequency of lifting loads with 66 % for 5 - 15 kg and 15 % for over 15 kg, but had no discernable effect oil awkward back postures. The use of a silo/truck with automated pump system also reduced the frequency of lifting with 32 % and 38 %, respectively, but increased the duration in awkward back postures with 13 %, primarily due to the hodman partly working as <b>floor</b> <b>layer.</b> <b>Floor</b> <b>layers</b> and hodmen using the mechanical equipment reported a lower prevalence of low back pain in the past 6 months and also less associated sick leave.

A reduction of the high physical work demands {{can be achieved by}} using ergonomic measures. However, these ergonomic measures must be effective and implemented. In the first part, the effect of ergonomic measures on the physical work demands and workload was evaluated in two highly demanding construction jobs: screed <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> and ironworkers.

Their work involves multiple sources of acute and chronic knee trauma including kneeling, pressure from sharp objects, {{and use of}} a device called a "knee kicker" to stretch wall to wall carpet. To characterise the knee morbidity in carpet layers and to identify occupational risk factors, a questionnaire was completed by 112 carpet and <b>floor</b> <b>layers,</b> 42 tile and terrazo setters, and 243 millwrights and bricklayers (MWBL). The MWBL comparison workers seldom kneel and do not use a knee kicker. Physical and xray examinations were conducted on a subset of 108 respondents to validate the questionnaire responses. Compared with the MWBL, carpet layers reported more frequent bursitis (20 % v 6 %), needle aspiration of knee fluid (32 % v 6 %), and skin infections of the knee (7 % v 2 %). A score indicating frequency of using the knee kicker was the only statistically significant predictor of bursitis, whereas the score for kneeling {{was one of several}} predictors of knee aspiration and skin infections of the knee. These data suggest that carpet and <b>floor</b> <b>layers</b> experience substantially more knee morbidity than other occupational groups, and that kneeling and use of the knee kicker are risk factors providing opportunities for prevention...|$|R
