Traffic is usually intercepted at the packet level, and either stored for later analysis or filtered in real-time. Unlike other areas of digital forensics network data is often volatile and rarely logged, making the discipline often reactionary.|$|E

Behind it, a bronze relief of the coat of arms of Slovenia is positioned on the marble wall. The sculptor Marko Pogačnik created the work in 1991 to celebrate independence. There is also a 106-seat gallery for the public and guests to view the Great Hall.|$|E

These gates, connected to a <b>computer</b> <b>network,</b> can read and update electronic tickets capable of storing data, and can store information such as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip. General Ticketing Machines sell tickets for single trips or allow the customer to buy additional value for stored-value tickets.

Tickets that can be used repeatedly until their expiry date require a minimum amount of stored credit.|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} life in a {{community}} {{can be seen as the}} nexus of 'social capital' and civic engagement (Putnam 1993, Coleman 1988). `Social capital' accumulates through dense social networks and trust, and the norms of mutual reciprocity that these trusted relationships foster (Putnam 1993). This paper explores the relationship between <b>computer</b> <b>networks,</b> social networks and civic engagement in a geographic community using survey and interview data collected among residents over a three year period (1996 through 1999). Social relationships are the basis of social networks. Relationships form through interaction among individuals, whether face-to-face or mediated by communication technology (telephone, <b>computer</b> <b>networks).</b> <b>Computer</b> <b>networks,</b> like the telephone, can reinforce existing social networks. In fact, according to Wellman (1996), when <b>computer</b> <b>networks</b> link people as well as machines, they become social networks. The evidence described in this paper shows that <b>computer</b> <b>networks</b> are [...] ...|$|R
5|$|The Internet {{works in}} part because of {{protocols}} that govern how the computers and routers communicate with each other. The nature of <b>computer</b> <b>network</b> communication lends itself to a layered approach where individual protocols in the protocol stack run more-or-less independently of other protocols. This allows lower-level protocols to be customized for the network situation while not changing the way higher-level protocols operate. A practical example of why this is important is because it allows an Internet browser to run the same code regardless of whether the computer it is running on is connected to the Internet through an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection. Protocols are often talked about in terms of their place in the OSI reference model (pictured on the right), which emerged in 1983 as the first step in an unsuccessful attempt to build a universally adopted networking protocol suite.|$|E
5|$|The {{late 1990s}} saw an {{increase}} in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of audio file formats such as MP3 and Real Audio, combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet made it simpler for bootleg collectors to exchange recordings. The arrival of Napster in 1999 made it easy to share bootlegs between a large <b>computer</b> <b>network.</b> Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from bootleg CDs were ripped to computer hard disks, and new material was created with digital recording of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option of searching for and downloading bootlegs of individual songs. Artists gave a mixed reaction to bootleg sharing via the internet; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while King Crimson's Robert Fripp and, infamously, Metallica were strongly critical of the ease in which Napster could circumvent the traditional channels of royalty payments.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} characteristic of <b>computer</b> <b>networks</b> is their topological structure. The {{question of the}} description of the structural characteristics of <b>computer</b> <b>networks</b> represents a problem that is not completely solved. Search methods for structures of <b>computer</b> <b>networks,</b> for which the values of the selected parameters of their operation quality are extreme, have not been completely developed. The construction of <b>computer</b> <b>networks</b> with optimum indices of their operation quality is reduced to the solution of discrete optimization problems over graphs.

Also, the topological analysis and synthesis of some classes of these networks have been performed. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
