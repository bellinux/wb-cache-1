25|$|In 922 a {{controversy}} arose concerning the Hebrew calendar, that threatened the entire Jewish community. Since Hillel II (around 359 CE), the calendar had {{been based on}} a series of rules (described more fully in Maimonides' Code) rather than on observation of the moon's phases. One of these rules required the date of Rosh Hashanah to be postponed if the calculated lunar conjunction occurred at noon or later. Rabbi Aaron ben Meir, the Gaon of the leading Talmudic academy in Israel (then located in Ramle), claimed a tradition according to which the <b>cutoff</b> <b>point</b> was 642/1080 of an hour (approximately 35 minutes) after noon.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the correlation between body mass index (BMI) with WC and WHR and suggest <b>cutoff</b> <b>points</b> for WC among Rural Malaysian adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 669 respondents from three villages in Tanjung Karang, located in the district of Kuala Selangor. Data collection was carried out by guided questionnaires and anthropometric measures. Results: The prevalence of abdominal obesity for BMI was almost similar for both gender across Caucasian and Asian BMI <b>cutoff</b> <b>points.</b> Based on Caucasian <b>cutoff</b> <b>points,</b> the prevalence of abdominal obesity for WC was 23. 8 % (male) and 66. 4 % (female) while for WHR was 6. 2 % (male) and 54. 2 % (female). Asian <b>cutoff</b> <b>points</b> gave higher prevalence of abdominal obesity compared to that of WC among male respondents and WHR for both genders. WC showed strong and positive correlation with BMI compared to WHR (in male WC r = 0. 78, WHR r = 0. 24 and in female WC r = 0. 72, WHR r = 0. 19; P < 0. 001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested WC <b>cutoff</b> <b>points</b> of 92. 5 cm in men and 85. 5 cm in women is the optimal number for detection of abdominal obesity.

40|$|Objective: To propose <b>cutoff</b> <b>points</b> for waist {{circumference}} of schoolchildren for {{the identification of}} cardiovascular disease risk factors. Methods: This school-based cross-sectional study surveyed 1, 413 schoolchildren aged 7 to 12 years old, selected by random cluster sampling. Waist circumference, total cholesterol and systolic and diastolic pressures were measured. Reference values for cardiovascular disease risk factors were developed from measures of total cholesterol and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and bivariate analysis, followed by calculation of sensitivity, specificity and odds ratio, were used in data analysis. Results: The <b>cutoff</b> <b>points</b> had area values under the ROC curve ranging between 0. 603 and 0. 949, while sensitivity and specificity ranged between 0. 500 and 1. 00.

40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{guidelines}} {{stressed the}} need to adopt different values of waist circumference (WC) measurements to define abdominal obesity in different ethnic groups. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify WC <b>cutoff</b> <b>points</b> in normotensive and hypertensive subjects which are diagnostic of abdominal obesity in a Middle Eastern population and the prevalence of abdominal obesity in a nationwide sample. Methods Data were collected during phase- 2 of the Egyptians National Hypertension Project survey. Blood pressure, anthropometric measurements and laboratory studies were performed according to a standardized protocol by trained personnel. To derive the <b>cutoff</b> <b>points</b> for WC, we applied the factor analysis on CV risk factors: diabetes mellitus, decrease in HDL-C and increase in LDL-C, triglycerides and left ventricular mass index by echocardiography. Results The sample included 2313 individuals above the age of 25 years. WC values (mean ± SD) were 88 ± 14 cm and 95 ± 14 cm for normotensive (NT) and hypertensive (HT) men respectively, and 89. 6 ± 14. 7 cm and 95. 7 ± 15. 9 cm for NT and HT women respectively. Applying factor analysis, the weighted average <b>cutoff</b> <b>points</b> were 93. 5 cm for both NT and HT men and 91. 5 and 92. 5 cm for NT and HT women respectively. Based on these thresholds, the prevalence of abdominal obesity was 48 % in men and 51. 5 % in women. Conclusion This is the first report of specific abdominal obesity <b>cutoff</b> <b>points</b> in a Middle Eastern country. The <b>cutoff</b> <b>points</b> were different from the Europid standards. There is a high prevalence rate of abdominal obesity among Egyptians which is associated with increased prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors. </p...|$|R
