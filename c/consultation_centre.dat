40|$|Objective The French {{national}} {{occupational disease}} surveillance and prevention network (RNV 3 P) includes the 30 occupational disease <b>consultation</b> <b>centres</b> in university hospitals to which patients are referred for potentially work-related diseases, and an occupational health service. The {{aim of this}} work is to demonstrate the contribution of RNV 3 P to national health surveillance. Methods Data from consultations are recorded in standardised occupational health reports and coded using international or national classifications. Programmed health surveillance is carried out through annual follow-up of annual referrals to experts for pre-selected disease–exposure associations, as well as incidence estimations for the well characterised working population followed by the occupational health service. Hypotheses on new emerging diseases are generated using statistical methods employed in pharmacosurveillance and by modelling as an exposome to analyse multiple exposures. Results 58 777 occupational health reports were collected and analysed from 2001 to 2007. Referrals to the 30 university hospital centres increased significantly for asbestos-related diseases, mood disorders and adjustment disorders related to psychological and organisational demands, and for elbow and shoulder disorders related to manual handling. Referrals significantly decreased for asthma and for rhinitis related to exposure to organic dusts (vegetable or animal) or chemicals, except for cosmetics and cleaning products. Estimation of incidences by the occupational health services showed different patterns in different sectors of activity. The methods for detecting emerging diseases are presented and illustrated using the example of systemic sclerosis, identifying new exposures and new sectors of activity to be investigated. Conclusion The RNV 3 P collects data from two complementary samples: 30 university hospital centres (workers or former workers) and an occupational health service (current workers). This dual approach is useful for surveillance and for hypothesis generation on new emerging disease–exposure associations...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{use of the}} {{telephone}} to deliver health care advice has increased considerably in recent years. Little research {{has been carried out}} to explore the experience of patients who receive such advice and its acceptability. Objectives. The aim {{of this study is to}} describe the expectations of patients, or third party callers, who had contacted a GP out-of-hours co-operative and their satisfaction with telephone advice received. Methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone 7 - 10 days after contact with one inner city GP co-operative. Results. A total of 47 telephone consultations were followed up with an interview. Of these, 23 (48. 9 %) callers had expected to be offered a home visit when they called. Reasons for wanting a home visit were either to do with the nature of the condition and its perceived severity, problems in being able to attend the primary care centre and the risks of travel, or because of problems in communicating over {{the telephone}}. Satisfaction with telephone <b>consultations</b> <b>centred</b> mostly on the doctor being able to provide reassurance and give adequate time to allay concerns. The most common reasons given for dissatisfaction were the caller feeling that the doctor could not make a correct diagnosis without having seen the patient, or the caller being made to feel that they were wasting the doctor's time. Many patients were anxious about their ability to describe symptoms over the telephone, or understand and follow the advice that they received. Conclusions. There appears to be a need for patients to be better informed about the service they can expect to receive from GP co-operatives.

Methods: It was a cross sectional descriptive study done at a child and adolescent <b>consultation</b> <b>centre,</b> Dhaka. The study was Carried out from January 2009 to December 2009. Both boys and girls {{were included in the}} study. A total of 42 children with childhood autism aged between two and 12 years partici­pated in this study. Diagnosis of autism was based on ICD- 10 (DCR) criteria. Results: Abnormalities were found to be 35. 7 % in MRI and 42. 9 % in EEG. EEG abnormalities were found in the form of defuse slow waves activities, generalized faster activities, epileptogenic discharge and mixed discharge. The abnormalities in MRI was found in the form of diffuse cortical atrophic changes, focal cortical atrophy in frontal and temporal cortex with widening of major sulci, prominent ventricles, periventricular degeneration and abnormal basal ganglia.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] report {{is based on an}} analysis of 6411 consultations processed by the Tygerberg Pharmacology and Toxicology <b>Consultation</b> <b>Centre.</b> Seventy-five per cent of the consultations were of a toxicological nature: 47 % related to non-drug chemicals, 37 % to drugs and 16 % to plants and animals. Pesticides utilised in the home environment featured most prominently in the non-drug chemical group, while queries about paracetamol overdose topped the list in the drug group. The most frequent queries in the biological category concerned potentially poisonous plants. Twenty-five per cent of the consultations related to pharmacotherapeutics. Most potentially toxic exposures to non-drug chemicals occurred in the household setting. Contrary to popular belief, few acute pesticide poisonings were encountered as a result of exposures during farming activities. Another important finding was that there is a frustrating lack of reliable and readily available information in respect of potentially toxic ingredients contained in household and industrial preparations. The large number of household exposures highlights the need for education in the safe storage and usage of non-drug chemicals. Legislation on the inclusion of basic toxicological information and warnings on labels of household and industrial non-drug chemical products should be considered. In addition, the Government should take responsibility for centralising information on all potentially toxic non-drug chemicals and make this information available to poison centres at all times. It is also imperative that more attention be given to the training of health care professionals in applied pharmacokinetics and toxicology. Publisher’s versio...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{adequacy}} of micronutrient intake {{is a public}} health concern, as both insufficient and excessive intake levels may result in adverse health effects. Data on dietary intake are needed to evaluate potential problems regarding inadequate intake at population level and to formulate effective public health and food safety recommendations. Assessing the intake of micronutrients in population subgroups such as infants, toddlers, pregnant and lactating women is challenging and requires specific approaches. This paper describes the Belgian VITADEK study, developed to assess fat-soluble vitamin intake from the consumption of food, fortified foods and supplements in four vulnerable groups namely infants, toddlers, pregnant and lactating women. Methods: Subjects were selected according to a multi-stage stratified sampling design with a selection of clusters proportionate to the population size. Recruitment occurred in collaboration with Belgian child health <b>consultation</b> <b>centres</b> and obstetric clinics. Participants {{were asked to complete}} a self-administered online food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) or to answer the questionnaire by phone if online participation was not possible. The questionnaire was tailored to the specific diet of the different target populations. In order to capture vitamin intake from the consumption of foods, fortified foods and supplements, a market study was conducted to take an inventory of the fortified foods and supplements available on the Belgian market. The food list of the FFQ was based on both this inventory and the top 90 % food groups that contribute to fat-soluble vitamin intake. Since fortification differs at brand level, food groups and subgroups were split up {{to the level of the}} brand of foods. Brand pictures were used as mnemonics to facilitate the recall of the consumed food items and portion pictures were used to facilitate the reproduction of the consumed portion sizes. Finally a composition table was compiled allowing for the computation of vitamin intake from all sources providing as such more accurate estimates of fat-soluble vitamin intake. Discussion: The results will allow assessing inadequate micronutrient intake by comparison of vitamin intake with dietary reference values. The data will further allow describing the most contributing food groups as well as the contribution of fortified foods and supplements to total vitamin intake. The data will enable evaluating whether infants, toddlers, pregnant and/or lactating women are reached by the actual Belgian fortification and supplementation programmes. Finally the retrieved data will reveal the potential for voluntary fortification and the need for future fortification and supplementation programmes...|$|R
