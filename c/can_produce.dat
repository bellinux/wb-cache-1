5|$|A {{warm front}} <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> snow for a period, as warm, moist air {{overrides}} below-freezing air and creates precipitation at the boundary. Often, snow transitions to {{rain in the}} warm sector behind the front.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E

5|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} {{probabilistic}} models that can assign likelihoods to all possible combinations of gaps, matches, and mismatches {{to determine the}} most likely MSA or set of possible MSAs. HMMs <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> a single highest-scoring output but can also generate a family of possible alignments that can then be evaluated for biological significance. HMMs <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> both global and local alignments. Although HMM-based methods have been developed relatively recently, they offer significant improvements in computational speed, especially for sequences that contain overlapping regions.|$|E

5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{has been}} used to perform {{systematic}} studies of Mars and has taken the highest resolution images of Mars ever captured from Earth. This telescope <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> useful images of the planet when it is at an angular distance of at least 50° from the Sun. The HST can take images of a hemisphere, which yields views of entire weather systems. Earth-based telescopes equipped with charge-coupled devices <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> useful images of Mars, allowing for regular monitoring of the planet's weather during oppositions.|$|E

The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that on the early Earth lies at just under 0.5AU. Epsilon Eridani's proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets have made it a destination for interstellar travel in science fiction stories.|$|E
5|$|After a B cell {{produces}} a functional immunoglobulin gene during V(D)J recombination, it cannot express any other variable region (a {{process known as}} allelic exclusion) thus each B cell <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> antibodies containing only one kind of variable chain.|$|E
5|$|Another sort of {{risk that}} can affect dry cargoes, is {{absorption}} of ambient moisture. When very fine concretes and aggregates mix with water, the mud created {{at the bottom of}} the hold shifts easily and <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> a free surface effect. The only way to control these risks is by good ventilation practices and careful monitoring for the presence of water.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its role}} in facilitating iron uptake, copper {{deficiency}} <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> anemia-like symptoms, neutropenia, bone abnormalities, hypopigmentation, impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism. Conversely, Wilson's disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues.|$|E
5|$|Bridging wires are rods that couple {{together}} resonators {{that are}} not adjacent. They {{can be used to}} produce poles of attenuation in the stopband. This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection. When the pole is placed near the passband edge, it also has the benefit of increasing roll-off and narrowing the transition band. The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11. Bridging across a single resonator (figure 11b) <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> a pole of attenuation in the high stopband. Bridging across two resonators (figure 11c) <b>can</b> <b>produce</b> a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband. Using multiple bridges (figure 11d) will result in multiple poles of attenuation. In this way, the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range.|$|E
