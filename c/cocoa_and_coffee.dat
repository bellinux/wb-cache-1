5|$|By {{becoming}} chef de canton, Houphouët assumed {{responsibility for}} the administration of Akouè, a canton which comprised 36 villages. He also {{took charge of the}} family plantation—at the time {{one of the most important}} in the country—and worked to diversify its rubber, <b>cocoa</b> <b>and</b> <b>coffee</b> crops. He soon became one of Africa's richest farmers. On 3 September 1944, he established, in cooperation with the colonial administration, the African Agricultural Union (Syndicat agricole africain, SAA). Under his presidency, the SAA brought together African farmers who were dissatisfied with their working conditions and worked to protect their interests against those of European planters. Anti-colonialist and anti-racist, the organisation demanded better working conditions, higher wages, and the abolition of unfree labor. The union quickly received the support of nearly 20,000 plantation workers, together with that of the left-wing French administrators placed in office by the Provisional Government. Its success irritated colonists to the extent that they took legal action against Houphouët, accusing him of being anti-French for never seeking French citizenship. However, Houphouët befriended the Inspector Minister of the Colonies, who ordered the charges dropped. They were more successful in obtaining the replacement of the sympathetic Governor André Latrille with the hostile Governor Henry de Mauduit.|$|E
25|$|A {{growing number}} of foreigners from {{neighboring}} Cameroon, Nigeria, and Gabon have immigrated to the country. According to the Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations (2002) 7% of Bioko islanders were Igbo, an ethnic group from southeastern Nigeria. Equatorial Guinea received Asians and black Africans from other countries as workers on <b>cocoa</b> <b>and</b> <b>coffee</b> plantations. Other black Africans came from Liberia, Angola, and Mozambique. Most of the Asian population is Chinese, with small numbers of Indians.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} of {{close ties to}} France since independence in 1960, diversification of agriculture for export, and encouragement of foreign investment have been factors in the economic growth of Ivory Coast. In recent years, Ivory Coast has been subject to greater competition and falling prices {{in the global marketplace}} for its primary agricultural crops: coffee and cocoa. That, compounded with high internal corruption, makes life difficult for the grower, those exporting into foreign markets, and the labor force, inasmuch as instances of indentured labor {{have been reported in the}} <b>cocoa</b> <b>and</b> <b>coffee</b> production in every edition of the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor since 2009.|$|E

25|$|The coffee {{companies}} of Houston formed the Greater Houston Coffee Association in fall 2000. The industry {{then tried to}} make Houston a major coffee shipping port. Coffee sold through futures contracts may only be shipped to a New York Board of Trade-certified port, and Texas's ad valorem tax on warehouse inventories {{made it impossible for}} Houston to get such a certification. The tax was written into the Constitution of Texas, so the Greater Houston Coffee Association asked State Representative Joe E. Moreno and State Senator Mario Gallegos to present a constitutional amendment bill to exempt <b>cocoa</b> <b>and</b> <b>coffee</b> stored in Harris County warehouses from the tax. Voters approved the amendment in 2001. Since then Houston's role as a coffee port increased. After Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, much of the traffic switched to Houston.|$|E
500|$|The French {{granted the}} chiefs {{significantly}} less power than had their German predecessors. Atangana's major role was simple: {{to enforce the}} dictats of French rule. Governor General Van Vollenhoven wrote in 1917 that, [...] "the chiefs have no power of their own of any kind because there are not two authorities in the circle: French authority and indigenous authority; there is only one. Only {{the commander of the}} circle commands." [...] As a colonial administrator, Atangana was expected to collect taxes, help the French introduce <b>cocoa</b> <b>and</b> <b>coffee</b> plantations, and mobilise chiefs to secure the labour to work these estates. In 1924, the French introduced a requisition system to procure food for the Yaoundé urban community and for rail labourers; Atangana was responsible for rallying the chiefs to gather the necessary provisions from rural farmers; the exact methods used by the chiefs was left to them. Cocoa production in the South and Centre provinces increased even during the Great Depression, partially {{as a result of these}} efforts. He reorganised the chiefs and their duties and tried to Westernise his subjects by encouraging them to wear European-style clothing, use new building methods and house styles, and work to improve roads.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} three decades, the Dominican economy, {{formerly}} dependent on the export of agricultural commodities (mainly sugar, <b>cocoa</b> <b>and</b> <b>coffee),</b> has transitioned to a diversified mix of services, manufacturing, agriculture, mining, and trade. The service sector accounts for almost 60% of GDP; manufacturing, for 22%; tourism, telecommunications and finance are {{the main components of}} the service sector; however, none of them accounts for more than 10% of the whole. The Dominican Republic has a stock market, Bolsa de Valores de la Republica Dominicana (BVRD). and advanced telecommunication system and transportation infrastructure. Nevertheless, [...] government corruption, and inconsistent electric service remain major problems. The country also has [...] "marked income inequality." [...] International migration affects the Dominican Republic greatly, as it receives and sends large flows of migrants. Mass illegal Haitian immigration and the integration of Dominicans of Haitian descent are major issues. A large Dominican diaspora exists, mostly in the United States, contributes to development, sending billions of dollars to Dominican families in remittances.|$|E

These were removed to the mouth of the cave, and after them the other things and the food; also a bell tent and some camp furniture that we had brought from the ship. Then Bastin made some tea of which he drank four large pannikins, having first said grace over it with unwonted fervour. Nor did we disdain our share of the beverage, although Bickley preferred cocoa and I coffee. <b>Cocoa</b> <b>and</b> <b>coffee</b> we had no time to make then, and in view of that sepulchre in the cave, what had we to do with <b>cocoa</b> <b>and</b> <b>coffee?</b> ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} conditions under which (brands of) Transnational Companies from the North <b>and</b> <b>cocoa,</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> tea (smallholder) farmers in the South can scale up responsible trading linkages through the supply chain. Through literature on Value Chain Analysis, agribusiness and responsible trade, the author arrives at a framework of relevant issues. Building upon this framework and the insights gained through 15 interviews, five case studies are presented and scrutinised. The argument developed is twofold. First, for the advantages of responsible trade to be enjoyed by more than a small minority of <b>cocoa,</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> tea (smallholder) farmers, we must study the operational obstacles and drivers that (brands of) TNCs face when scaling up the purchasing of produce through certification NGOs. Second, smallholder farmer inclusion is possible only if certification NGOs and individual TNC-level sustainability initiatives are capable of matching the scale-related needs of (brands of) TNCs with smallholder farmer capacities...|$|R
