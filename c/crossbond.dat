30|$|The extract was {{directly}} {{used for the}} analysis. GC-MS was carried out on a GCMS-QP 2010 Plus (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) system with head space sampler (AOC- 20 s) and auto injector (AOC- 20 i), equipped with mass selective detector, having ion source temperature of 230 °C, interface temperature of 260 °C, a solvent cut time of 2.50  min threshold of 1, 000  eV and mass range of 40 to 650  m/z. Compounds were separated using a Rtx 5 MS capillary column (Restek Company, Bellefonte, USA: <b>crossbond</b> 5 % diphenyl/ 95 % dimethyl polysiloxane) having dimensions 30  m (length)[*]×[*] 0.25  mm (diameter)[*]×[*] 0.25  μm (film thickness). The split mode was used {{at a ratio of}} 10 : 1. The temperature of the injector was initialized to 250 °C, having a split injection mode. The temperature was programmed from 100 °C (3  min), then further increased to 280 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min (19  min hold).|$|E

The green mustard was collected of ready harvest condition with sample collecting point on diagonal form in the farm. As standard was used chylorpyrifos 99, 9 %. The research was begin with make the standard at 0, 05 ppm dan sample extraction was made duplo. Standard solution and sample was injected by rolling over in the gas chromatography with column of fused silica Rtx- 1 (<b>crossbond</b> dimetyl polisiloxan length 30 meter, inner diameter 0, 25 mm and the partikel diameter of stationary phase fase diam 0. 25 um), electron capture detector, carrier gas nitrogen with flow rate 1, 61 mL/min, conditioned at column temperatur 250 C, injector temperature 280 C and detector temperature 300 C and operating time for 15 minutes. The parameter was used is time retention (tR). The result showed at chromatogram in sample I and II, time retention was obtained similar with standard solution time retention although showed time retention difference above required limit while in sample I and II having the characteistic retention time of standard solution. The retention time based on gas chromatography method can be knew the concentration of chlorpyrifos as 1, 0024 mg/kg but it still on tolerance threshold the maximum residue limits (MRL) is 0, 1 mg/k...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} {{gas chromatography}} coupled to quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOF-MS) methodologies {{were carried out}} {{for the analysis of}} phytosterols and tocopherols in the flesh of three mango cultivars and their by-products (pulp, peel, and seed). To that end, a non-polar column ((5 %-phenyl) -methylpolysiloxane (HP- 5 ms)) and a mid-polar column (<b>crossbond</b> trifluoropropylmethyl polysiloxane (RTX- 200 MS)) were used. The analysis time for RTX- 200 MS was much lower than the one obtained with HP- 5 ms. Furthermore, the optimized method for the RTX- 200 MS column had a higher sensibility and precision of peak area than the HP- 5 ms methodology. However, RTX- 200 MS produced an overlapping between β-sitosterol and Δ 5 -avenasterol. Four phytosterols and two tocopherols were identified in mango samples. As far as we are concerned, {{this is the first time}} that phytosterols have been studied in mango peel and that Δ 5 -avenasterol has been reported in mango pulp. α- and γ-tocopherol were determined in peel, and α-tocopherol was the major tocopherol in this fraction (up to 81. 2 %); however, only α-tocopherol was determined in the pulp and seed. The peel was the fraction with the highest total concentration of phytosterols followed by seed and pulp, and “Sensación” was the cultivar with the highest concentration of total phytosterols in most cases. There were no significant differences between quantification of tocopherols with both columns. However, in most cases, quantification of phytosterols was higher with RTX- 200 MS than with HP- 5 ms column...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} sheath voltage limiter(SVL) {{transient characteristics}} by switching overvoltage considering single point bonding in underground transmission cables. The <b>crossbonding</b> system is generally used for grounding methods of underground transmission system. However, the single point bonding system {{is used in}} selective area which is difficult to consist of <b>crossbonding</b> major section. The sheath voltage limiters are connected between joints in the single point bonding. Specially, the high overvoltage might be generated in that section {{as well as the}} aging of sheath voltage limiter might be progressed by various electrical stress including lightning overvoltage, switching overvoltage and power frequency overvoltage. Therefore, in this paper, the switching overvoltage characteristics in underground cables are firstly analysed using EMTP simulation. Then, the switching overvoltage of sheath voltage limiter is also studied in single point bonding. Finally, the reduction method of sheath voltage limiter switching overvoltage is proposed by various simulation studies including circui...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the detection and localization of partial discharge (PD) in <b>crossbonded</b> (CB) high voltage (HV) cables. A great deal {{has been published}} in recent years on PD based cable insulation condition monitoring, diagnostics and localization in medium voltage (MV) and high voltage (HV) cables. The topic of pulse propagation and PD source localization in CB HV cable systems {{has yet to be}} significantly investigated. The main challenge to PD monitoring of CB HV cables is {{as a result of the}} interconnectedness of the sheaths of the three single phase cables. The cross-bonding of the sheaths makes it difficult to localize which of the three phases a PD signal has emanated from. Co-axial cables are used to connect cable sheaths to cable link boxes, for ease of installation and protection against moisture. A second challenge is, therefore, the coupling effect when a PD pulse propagates in HV cable joints and the co-axial cables, making PD detection and localization more complex. The paper presents experimental investigations into PD pulse coupling between the cable center conductor and the sheath and the behavior of PD pulse propagation in CB HV cables. It proposes a model to describe PD pulse propagation in a CB HV cable system to allow monitoring and localization, and also presents the knowledge rules required for PD localization in CB HV cable systems...|$|R
