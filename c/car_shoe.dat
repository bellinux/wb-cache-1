30|$|Dove (2016) {{argues that}} {{abstract}} concepts {{are not easily}} reconcilable under current embodied theories, citing a number of physiological studies demonstrating activation differences while participants process concrete rather than abstract concepts. Furthermore, familiarity with such concepts results in their apparent dissociation from sensorimotor regions and an increased reliance on left hemispheric structures (see Binder, Westbury, McKiernan, Possing, & Medler, 2005). While such findings may appear to bolster amodal conceptual theories, suggesting distinctive mechanisms for processing concrete and abstract concepts, the shallow recognition protocols (e.g., lexical discrimination tasks) used in many such tasks fail {{to account for the}} contextual relativity inherent to abstract knowledge. In other words, recognizing a word does not require the same depth of information processing as retrieving its meaning. Xiao et al. (2012), for instance, argue that contextual details facilitate recollection of concrete words leading to faster RTs during a recognition task. Evidenced by an increased parietal P 600 response for tangible concepts, an evoked potential typically associated with the integration of contextual details, the authors conclude that abstract words are more difficult to process given the absence of such details when interpreted independently of context, which is crucial for understanding them (Katja Wiemer-Hastings & Xu, 2005). In other words, concrete concepts (e.g., <b>car,</b> <b>shoe)</b> evoke a rapid representation grounded in modality-specific features (visual, tactile, etc.) while abstract concepts (e.g., inequality) require external conceptually relevant cues used to derive a complete understanding of the idea.|$|E

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{information}} economy is split in two. On the one hand, there is the traditional capitalist economy that works with monetary incentives. This economy still handles {{the main part of}} material production: the production of <b>cars,</b> <b>shoes,</b> computer chips, and the transportation and maintenance of these goods. But immaterial production- the production of the ideas, innovations, experiences and other intangibles that virtually everybody agrees {{to be the most important}} source of value and development- is increasingly performed by another economy that does not primarily move according to monetary incentives. We provide a provisional analysis of the value logic of this non-monetary, ethical economy and point at three future scenarios in which the ethical economy challenges the hegemony of global capitalism...|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{attaching}} the stainless steel to the aluminium. The oldest is a co-extruded method, where the stainless steel is extruded with the aluminium. This method has suffered, in isolated cases, from de-lamination (where the stainless steel separates from the aluminium); this {{is said to have}} been eliminated in the latest co-extruded rails. A second method is an aluminium core, upon which two stainless steel sections are fitted as a cap and linear welded along the centre line of the rail. Because aluminium has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than steel, the aluminium and steel must be positively locked to provide a good current collection interface. A third method rivets aluminium bus strips to the web of the steel rail. The photo below-right of a Chicago L <b>car's</b> <b>shoe</b> depicts such a rail, showing the aluminum bus strips filling the space below the contact surface of the rail.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{linguistic}} analysis of reported auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) in Henry’s Demons (HD, 2011). The book, co-written by journalist Patrick Cockburn and his son Henry, relates the events surrounding Henry’s diagnosis of schizophrenia. The sections of HD narrated {{in the first person}} by Henry were written shortly after his most severe psychotic phase, and have been widely praised for providing an unusually vivid account of his ‘lived experience’, including his experience of voices that can be interpreted as AVHs. We discuss the linguistic representation of six types of voices: voices of plants (trees, brambles), inanimate things (wind, <b>cars,</b> <b>shoes),</b> real people Henry knows or knew, his own voice, voices of supernatural beings, and disembodied or unattributed voices. We focus on speech presentation, the idiosyncratic use of ‘feel’ (I felt the tree telling me to take off my shoes), and the complexity and style of the verbal content. We show how these aspects of Henry’s language use convey his personal experience of AVHs and enable readers to experience his ‘schizophrenic’ mind style. We therefore begin to account for readers’ overwhelmingly empathetic responses to the book, and for the role it has played in giving the public access to the mental life of someone who suffers from an often stigmatised condition. We also point out aspects of Henry’s experience of voices that are, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, undocumented in the schizophrenia literature, exploring in this way the potentials of stylistic analysis. ...|$|R

50|$|Nonetheless, {{the most}} {{important}} product of the Carnauba tree is its wax. Extracted from its leaves, the Carnauba wax {{can be used in}} floor, leather, furniture, <b>car</b> and <b>shoe</b> polish and enters into the manufacturer of carbon paper and candles - to raise the melting point, chalk, matches, soap and woodwork stains Carnauba wax consists of myricyl cerotate and small quantities of cerotic acid and myricyl alcohol. After harvesting, the leaves are left upon the field to dry under the sun. The thin layer of wax coating plant material disintegrates into a powder, which is then separated through beating and whisking the dried leaves. The powder is concentrated in a mortar, to be mixed with water and melted to produce liquid wax. After drying it is concentrated into chunks and sold.|$|R
