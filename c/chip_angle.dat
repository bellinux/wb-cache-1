Experiments were conducted {{on a wide range of}} cutting conditions with a particular attention to ensure a great confidence in the obtained results. A detailed analysis of experimental cutting forces and the identification of empirical cutting force equations similar to that usually used for flat tools are proposed. The main focus of this work is on the study of <b>chip</b> flow <b>angle</b> deduced here from experimental cutting forces, considering that the chip flow direction is collinear to the friction force. From a comparison between experiments and two often used approaches, it appears that the experimental <b>chip</b> flow <b>angle</b> estimation, based on neglecting the complex tool geometry and adopting a zero rake angle, is bounded by the two considered modelings that renders useful for the proposed study. From experiments it is also observed an increase of the <b>chip</b> flow <b>angle</b> as the cutting velocity is increased. A velocity-dependent modeling with two distinct strategies of identification is then proposed in order to capture the cutting velocity effect on the <b>chip</b> flow <b>angle...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this study, an {{experimental}} investigation of oblique cutting process is presented for titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, AISI 4340, and Al 7075. Important process parameters such as shear angle, friction angle, shear stress, and <b>chip</b> flow <b>angle</b> are analyzed. Transformation {{of the data}} from the orthogonal cutting test results to oblique cutting process is applied, and the results are compared with actual oblique cutting tests. Effects of hone radius on cutting forces and flank contact length are also investigated. It is observed that the shear angle, friction angle, and shear stress in oblique cutting have the same trend with the ones obtained from the orthogonal cutting tests. The transformed oblique force coefficients from orthogonal tests have about 10 % discrepancy in the feed and tangential directions. For the <b>chip</b> flow <b>angle,</b> the predictions based on kinematic and force balance results yield better results than Stabler's chip flow law.

40|$|Extensive {{numerical}} simulation and experimental verification of the predictive force and surface roughness models for turning operations {{have been carried}} out encompassing the domain of cutting conditions recommended in practice. It has been shown that the three force models predicted very similar qualitative and plausible trends in the tangential feed and radial force components as well as <b>chip</b> flow <b>angle</b> with changes in the many operation variables. The experimental testing involved about 500 turning cuts over a wide range of inclination angles, normal rake angles, major cutting edge angles, corner radius, feed and depth of cut. All the qualitative trends in the forces and <b>chip</b> flow <b>angle</b> noted in the simulation studies have been experimentally confirmed for all the three force models for both TiN coated and uncoated tools. The first two force models predictions correlated very well with the experimental results while only reasonable correlation was found with the third (approximate) model. The surface roughness predictive models were found to be adequate for turning with TiN coated HSS tools only while empirical equations were still necessary for reliable estimates of surface roughness for turning with the uncoated HSS tools. This investigation has shown that comprehensive and quantitatively reliable predictive models for the forces, power, <b>chip</b> flow <b>angle</b> and surface roughness can be established from fundamental cutting theory and analysis. In particular, the findings of this investigation provide further evidence in support of the generic nature of the `unified mechanics of cutting approach' to technological performance prediction and the potential of the predictive surface roughness models for machining with coated tools...|$|R

40|$|Nanometric {{cutting of}} single crystal silicon on {{different}} crystal orientations {{and at a}} wide range of temperatures (300 - 1500 K) was studied through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using two sorts of interatomic potentials, an analytical bond order potential (ABOP) and a modified version of Tersoff potential, so as to explore the cutting chip characteristics and chip formation mechanisms. Smaller released thermal energy and larger values of chip ratio (ratio of the uncut chip thickness to the cut chip thickness) as well as shear plane angle were obtained when cutting was performed at higher temperatures or on the (1 1 1) crystal plane, implying an enhancement in machinability of silicon. Nonetheless, the subsurface deformation depth was observed to become deeper under the aforementioned conditions. Further analysis revealed a higher number of atoms in the chip when cutting was implemented on the (1 1 0) crystal plane, attributable to the lower position of the stagnation region which triggered less ploughing action of the tool on the silicon substrate. Regardless of temperature of the substrate the minimum <b>chip</b> velocity <b>angle</b> was found while cutting the (1 1 1) crystal plane of silicon substrate whereas the maximum <b>chip</b> velocity <b>angle</b> appeared on the (1 1 0) surface. A discrepancy between the two potential functions in predicting the <b>chip</b> velocity <b>angle</b> was observed at high temperature of 1500 K, resulting from the overestimated phase instability and entirely molten temperatures of silicon by the ABOP function. Another key observation was that the resultant force exerted by the rake face of the tool on the chip was found to decrease by 24 % when cutting the (1 1 1) surface at 1173 K compared to that at room temperature. Besides, smaller resultant force, friction coefficient at the tool/chip interface and chip temperature was witnessed on the (1 1 1) crystal plane, as opposed to the other orientations...|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringIncludes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 65 - 67) Pure {{oblique cutting}} experiments with conventional cutting tools {{as well as}} ultra-sharp tools {{have been carried out}} under a wide range of cutting conditions using a linear slide based cutting set-up. The chip flow direction was measured using the 3 D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique of high-speed stereoscopic images and the frictional force direction was determined from forces.

An increasing trend of the angles with an increase in feed and a decreasing trend of the angles with an increase in speeds were observed.

40|$|There is an {{interest}} in industry in cost reduction. Tool wear constitutes {{an important element in}} the cost of many metal working processes, {{not only because of the}} cost of the tool, but also because of the cost of machine downtime. Saltbath nitriding of high speed steel tools adds only about 1 % to the cost of a finished tool, but has been found to confer benefits considerably in excess of this over a range of cutting conditions. A series of cutting tests is described, during which cutting forces and tool temperatures were recorded simultaneously using microcomputer based instrumentation developed at the Polytechnic as part of this study.

40|$|The {{orthogonal}} {{metal cutting}} process for a controlled contact tool is simulated using a limit analysis theorem. The basic principles are {{stated in the}} form of a primal optimization problem with an objective function subjected to constraints of the equilibrium equation, its static boundary conditions and a constitutive inequality. An Eulerian reference co-ordinate is used to describe the steady state motion of the workpiece relative to the tool. Based on a duality theorem, a dual functional bounds the objective functional of the primal problem from above by a sharp inequality. The dual formulation seeks the least upper bound and thus recovers the maximum of the primal functional theoretically. A finite element approximation of the continuous variables in the dual problem reduces it to a convex programming. Since the original dual problem admits discontinuous solutions {{in the form of}} bounded variation functions, care must be taken in the finite element approximation to account for such a possibility. This is accomplished by a combined smoothing and successive approximation algorithm. Convergence is robust from any initial iterate.

Consequently, the current work is based on FE simulation of hard turning of bearing steel (AISI 52100). Four types of micro-textures have been considered on the tool rake face: non-texture, perpendicular, parallel, and rectangle. Johnson-Cook (J-C) material constitutive law has been considered for the workpiece with temperature-dependent material properties. Experimental work has been performed at cutting conditions: type, parallel; edge distance, 0. 195 mm; pitch size, 0. 110 mm; and height of the texture, 0. 049 mm to validate the current machining model. Parametric study of effect of tool feature parameters on the cutting forces has been performed. Based on the current model, {{it is observed that}} the perpendicular shape showed the minimum cutting force. The maximum reduction of 28 % was predicted in the effective coefficient of friction compared to the non-textured surface. Additionally, effect of size of the texture (edge distance, pitch size, texture height) and the friction factor at tool-chip interface on the process responses is predicted. The perpendicular texture at an edge distance of 100 μm, pitch size of 100 μm, and texture height of 50 μm showed the most effective shape and size for the minimum cutting forces and effective friction.
