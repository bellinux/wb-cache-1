50|$|Cameras {{designed}} for use with flash bulbs generally had {{one or more of}} S (slow) sync, M (medium) sync, F (fast) sync, or FP/FPX (flat peak) sync, {{designed for}} use with corresponding bulb types. These sync modes close the contacts a few milliseconds before the shutter is open, to give the flashbulb time to reach peak brightness before exposing the film. <b>Class</b> <b>M</b> <b>bulbs</b> reach their peak illumination at around 20-25 milliseconds after ignition, and class F lamps reach their peak at approximately 5 milliseconds. Most standard flash <b>bulbs</b> used <b>M</b> sync. X sync closes the flash contact just as the shutter blades are almost completely open, and M sync closes the flash contact 20 milliseconds before the blades are completely open.|$|R

25|$|Although most <b>class</b> <b>M</b> {{stars are}} red dwarfs, most giants and some supergiants such as VY Canis Majoris, Antares and Betelgeuse are also <b>class</b> <b>M.</b> Furthermore, the hotter brown dwarfs are late <b>class</b> <b>M.</b> This is {{usually in the}} range of M6.5 to M9.5. The {{spectrum}} of a <b>class</b> <b>M</b> star contains lines from oxide molecules, especially TiO, in the visible and all neutral metals, but absorption lines of hydrogen are usually absent. TiO bands can be strong in <b>class</b> <b>M</b> stars, usually dominating their visible spectrum by about M5. Vanadium(II) oxide bands become present by late M.|$|R

25|$|<b>Class</b> <b>M</b> {{stars are}} by far the most common. About 76% of the main-sequence stars in the solar {{neighborhood}} are <b>class</b> <b>M</b> stars. However, <b>class</b> <b>M</b> main-sequence stars (red dwarfs) have such low luminosities that none are bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye, unless under exceptional conditions. The brightest known M-class main-sequence star is M0V Lacaille 8760, with magnitude 6.6 (the limiting magnitude for typical naked-eye visibility under good conditions is typically quoted as 6.5), and it is extremely unlikely that any brighter examples will be found.|$|R
