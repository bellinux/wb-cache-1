Analyses based on simulated X-band (8. 4 -GHz) Doppler and ranging measurements acquired during the interplanetary cruise segment of the Mars Pathfinder heliocentric trajectory were completed for the nominal trajectory design and for an alternative trajectory with a longer transit time. Several error models were developed to characterize the effect of Earth orientation on navigational accuracy based on current and anticipated Deep Space Network calibration strategies. The navigational sensitivity of Mars Pathfinder to <b>calibration</b> <b>errors</b> in Earth orientation was computed for each candidate calibration strategy with the Earth orientation parameters included as estimated parameters in the navigation solution. In these cases, the <b>calibration</b> <b>errors</b> contributed 23 to 58 % of the total navigation error budget, depending on the calibration strategy being assessed. Navigation sensitivity calculations were also performed for cases in which Earth orientation <b>calibration</b> <b>errors</b> were not adjusted in the navigation solution. In these cases, Earth orientation <b>calibration</b> <b>errors</b> contributed from 26 {{to as much as}} 227 % of the total navigation error budget.

40|$|Purpose: Goldmann {{applanation}} tonometer (GAT) is {{the current}} Gold standard tonometer. However, its <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> is common and can go unnoticed in clinics. Its company repair has limitations. The purpose of this report is to describe a self-taught technique of rectifying <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> of GAT. Materials and Methods: Twenty-nine slit-lamp-mounted Haag-Streit Goldmann tonometers (Model AT 900 C/M; Haag-Streit, Switzerland) were included in this cross-sectional interventional pilot study. The technique of rectification of <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> of the tonometer involved cleaning and lubrication of the instrument followed by alignment of weights when lubrication alone didn′t suffice. We followed the South East Asia Glaucoma Interest Group′s definition of <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> tolerance (acceptable GAT <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> within ± 2, ± 3 and ± 4 mm Hg at the 0, 20 and 60 -mm Hg testing levels, respectively). Results: Twelve out of 29 (41. 3 %) GATs were out of calibration. The range {{of positive and negative}} <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> at the clinically most important 20 -mm Hg testing level was 0. 5 to 20 mm Hg and - 0. 5 to - 18 mm Hg, respectively. Cleaning and lubrication alone sufficed to rectify <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> of 11 (91. 6 %) faulty instruments. Only one (8. 3 %) faulty GAT required alignment of the counter-weight. Conclusions: Rectification of <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> of GAT is possible in-house. Cleaning and lubrication of GAT can be carried out even by eye care professionals and may suffice to rectify <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> in the majority of faulty instruments.

The simulation results show that the phase-restoration error is approximately proportional to the phase shift error and zeroth order effect, when the phase shifting error is less than 2 ° and the zeroth order effect is less than 0.2. The experimental result shows that compared with the conventional method with 9 -frame interferograms, the calibration method with 5 -frame interferograms achieves nearly the same restoration accuracy.|$|E

While the analytical explanations are derived in the context of linear techniques for motion estimation, we verify our observations experimentally on a variety of optimal and suboptimal motion and structure estimation algorithms.

40|$|The {{calibration}} transfer problem {{examined by}} this thesis {{is that of}} attempting to exploit the knowledge of an initial instrument calibration model so as to obtain a second similar model, having acceptable accuracy, with less data than that used to obtain the initial model. This thesis considers instruments whose calibration model {{are based on a}} feedforward neural network, FFNN. The recalibration of these instruments has raised concerns regarding the significant quantity of data needed to perform their recalibration. Calibration transfer methods provide an alternative to recalibration which can reduce the data needed for a recalibration while maintaining acceptable levels of calibration accuracy. Currently no reported methods of calibration transfer exist for the FFNN based instrument. This thesis develops a number of calibration transfer methods that allow a recalibration using less data than that needed in a recalibration employing conventional backpropagation learning. First, a simple non-learning method is introduced. A new method is developed based on a supervised learning algorithm employing a measure that learns the 'n'th order partial derivatives of the desired calibration model provided by the calibration data. Finally, a simple unreported method of initialising the weights of a FFNN so as to begin learning from a point on the error surface that provides the approximation of a previously obtained calibration model is described. Using computer simulations, the <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> associated with using these calibration transfer methods are compared to the error obtained from a recalibration using conventional backpropagation learning. The simulations varied the numbers of neurons, number of calibration points, and similarity between calibration models. The desired calibration models were selected from 8 th order polynomials and bandlimited normal random processes. The simulations indicated that no one method of calibration transfer provides the least <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> but it is possible to achieve a 2 to 1000 fold decrease in the median <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> relative to that of the standard recalibration while using half the calibration data.

40|$|The {{decay of}} {{gravitational}} potentials {{in the presence}} of dark energy leads to an additional, late-time contribution to anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at large angular scales. The imprint of this so-called Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect to the CMB angular power spectrum has been detected and studied in detail, but reconstructing its spatial contributions to the CMB map, which would offer the tantalizing possibility of separating the early- from the late-time contributions to CMB temperature fluctuations, is more challenging. Here we study the technique for reconstructing the ISW map based on information from galaxy surveys and focus in particular on how its accuracy is impacted by the presence of photometric <b>calibration</b> <b>errors</b> in input galaxy maps, which were previously found to be a dominant contaminant for ISW signal estimation. We find that both including tomographic information from a single survey and using data from multiple, complementary galaxy surveys improve the reconstruction by effectively self-calibrating the estimator against spurious power contributions from <b>calibration</b> <b>errors.</b> A high fidelity reconstruction further requires one to account for the contribution of <b>calibration</b> <b>errors</b> to the observed galaxy power spectrum in the model used to construct the ISW estimator. We find that if the photometric <b>calibration</b> <b>errors</b> in galaxy surveys can be independently controlled at the level required to obtain unbiased dark energy constraints, then it is possible to reconstruct ISW maps with excellent accuracy using a combination of maps from two galaxy surveys with properties similar to Euclid and SPHEREx.

The number of parameters is included as a decision variable along with parameter values. A parameterization based on B-spline surfaces (BSS) is selected to approximate transmissivity, and genetic algorithms were selected to perform error minimization. A transform based on linear least squares (LLS) is developed, so that different parameterizations may be combined by standard genetic algorithm operators. First, three applications, with isotropic, anisotropic, and zoned aquifer parameters, are examined in a single objective optimization problem and the estimated transmissivity {{is found to be}} near the true one. Interestingly, in the anisotropic case, the algorithm converged to a solution with an anisotropic distribution of control points. Next, a single objective optimization with regularization, penalizing complex models, is considered, and last, the problem is expressed in a multiobjective optimization framework (MOO), where the goals are simultaneous minimization of <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> and model complexity. The result of MOO is a Pareto set of potential solutions where the user can examine the tradeoffs between <b>calibration</b> <b>error</b> and model complexity and select the most suitable model.
