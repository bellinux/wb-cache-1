40|$|The Raft River Geothermal Site {{is located}} in Southern Idaho's Raft River Valley, {{southwest}} of Malta, Idaho, in Cassia County. EG and G idaho, Inc., is the DOE's prime contractor for development of the Raft River geothermal field. Contract work has been progressing for several years towards creating a fully integrated utilization of geothermal water. Developmental progress {{has resulted in the}} drilling of seven major DOE wells. Four are producing geothermal water from reservoir temperatures measured to approximately 149 C (approximately 300 F). <b>Closed-in</b> <b>well</b> head pressures range from 69 to 102 kPa (100 to 175 psi). Two wells are scheduled for geothermal cold 60 C (140 F) water reinjection. The prime development effort is for a power plant designed to generate electricity using the heat from the geothermal hot water. The plant is designated as the '' 5 MW(e) Raft River Research and Development Plant'' project. General site management assigned to EG and G has resulted in planning and development of many parts of the 5 MW program. Support and development activities have included: (1) engineering design, procurement, and construction support; (2) fluid supply and injection facilities, their study, and control; (3) development and installation of transfer piping systems for geothermal water collection and disposal by injection; and (4) heat exchanger fouling tests...|$|E
40|$|The maximum {{wellhead}} {{pressure at}} which hot water wells discharge {{is an important}} parameter for geothermal power and as it slowly declines with years of exploitation presents a moving target for project designers. It can also decrease rapidly for newly <b>closed-in</b> <b>wells</b> (within days or even hours) to {{a point at which}} auto-discharge is impossible and tedious techniques have to be employed to restart flow. The common cause of this phenomenon is reduction in the temperature of the hot water feeding the well; in the former case {{is the result of a}} general decline in the reservoir water enthalpy, and in the latter is due to cooler denser water from higher in the uncased part of the well percolating down and flooding the lower more permeable levels from which a discharging well mainly draws its fluids. The inter-relationship of feed water temperature, depth and maximum discharging-pressure is determined in this study with illustrated examples demonstrating application...|$|R
30|$|To kill a live <b>closed-in</b> gas <b>well</b> by bull-heading {{down the}} tubing, the {{selected}} pump rate should be {{high enough to}} ensure efficient displacement of the gas into the formation (i.e. to avoid the kill fluid bypassing the gas). On the other hand, the pressures that develop during bull-heading at a high rate must not exceed wellhead pressure rating, tubing or casing burst pressures or the formation breakdown gradient, since this will lead at best to a very inefficient job. Given these constraints, the optimum kill rate, required hydraulic horsepower, density, and type of kill fluids have to be selected.|$|R
