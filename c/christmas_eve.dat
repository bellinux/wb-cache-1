5|$|The crew of Apollo 8 {{sent the}} first live {{televised}} {{pictures of the}} Earth and the Moon back to Earth, and read from the creation story in the Book of Genesis, on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> 1968. An estimated {{one quarter of the}} population of the world saw—either live or delayed—the <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> transmission during the ninth orbit of the Moon, and an estimated one fifth {{of the population of the}} world watched the live transmission of the Apollo 11 moonwalk.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) reluctantly {{responds}} to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) call on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> {{to investigate a}} haunted house in Maryland. He explains that during Christmas of 1917, a young couple {{living in the house}} agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. He explains that they could not stand the thought of being alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to spend all eternity together. Now, Mulder claims, they haunt the house every <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} his son and of McKinley {{were not the only}} griefs Hay {{suffered}} in 1901—on September 26, John Nicolay died after a long illness, as did Hay's close friend Clarence King on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve.</b>|$|E
5|$|The last of {{the early}} operas, Vakula the Smith (Op.14), was {{composed}} {{in the second half}} of 1874. The libretto, based on Gogol's <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve,</b> was to have been set to music by Alexander Serov. With Serov's death, the libretto was opened to a competition with a guarantee that the winning entry would be premiered by the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. Tchaikovsky was declared the winner, but at the 1876 premiere, the opera enjoyed only a lukewarm reception. After Tchaikovsky's death, Rimsky-Korsakov wrote an opera based on the same story, <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve.</b>|$|E
5|$|The old English Christmas {{tradition}} of burning the Ashen faggot {{takes place at}} the Luttrell Arms hotel every <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve.</b> The pub was formerly a guest house for the Abbots of Cleeve; its oldest section dates from 1443.|$|E
5|$|Another death {{brought about}} a {{creative}} renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve,</b> a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> encouraged him to complete an opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it {{in the last four}} years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set a new standard for texts of its kind.|$|E
5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on Easter Sunday and is murdered by McTeague on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve.</b> <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.|$|E
5|$|On <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve,</b> {{an alien}} {{creature}} attaches itself to author J.K. Rowling.

5|$|The {{tradition}} {{of having a}} National Christmas Tree in Washington, D.C. began in 1923 when a 48-foot Balsam Fir from Vermont {{was placed in the}} Ellipse outside the White House. On <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve,</b> President Calvin Coolidge lit the 2,500 red, white and green electric bulbs on the tree.|$|E

It was watched by an estimated 7 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|Edmonton’s native Magic Lantern Theatres {{unexpectedly}} {{tried to}} buy the Princess for $500,000 on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> 1996. A condition in the Brar's contract stated that the sale could be voided if another party bid at least ten percent more for the building. However, the Brars exercised an option to match any higher bids, and the sale went through in early January 1997.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Kon's third work, Tokyo Godfathers, was announced. The film {{centers on}} a trio of {{homeless}} persons in Tokyo who discover a baby on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> {{and set out to}} search for her parents. Tokyo Godfathers cost more to make than Kon's previous two films (with a budget of approximately 300,000,000 yen), and centered on the themes of homelessness and abandonment, with a comedic touch worked in. The screenplay was written by Keiko Nobumoto.|$|E
5|$|Jingle All the Way is a 1996 American comedy film {{directed}} by Brian Levant and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sinbad, with Phil Hartman, Rita Wilson, Jake Lloyd, James Belushi and Robert Conrad.

5|$|NORAD's {{tracking}} of Santa's sleigh on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve,</b> for example, was initiated in 1955 {{and has become}} an annual tradition. The stop motion animated film, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer remains an annual telecast on American televisionalmost fifty years after its debut, and Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas! of 1957 has become a literary Christmas classic.|$|E
5|$|On <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve,</b> 1968, Apollo 8 {{went into}} {{orbit around the}} moon. Only ten years earlier, Kraft had joined Gilruth's newly founded Space Task Group. Now, the two men sat {{together}} in Mission Control, reflecting on how far they had come. Around them, the room was filled with cheers, but Kraft and Gilruth celebrated more quietly.|$|E
5|$|On December 18, 1965, Branham and {{his family}} (except his {{daughter}} Rebekah) were returning to Jeffersonville, Indiana from Tucson, Arizona for the Christmas holiday. About three miles east of Friona, Texas (about 70 miles south-west of Amarillo on U.S. Highway 60), just after dark, a car traveling west in the eastbound lane hit Branham's car head-on. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital in Amarillo, Texas, but died of his injuries on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve.</b>|$|E

Rob Ryan was dismissed as well. Following the season, Ryan went on a profane tirade against the team for allegedly quitting on him.|$|E
5|$|Point Loma {{is noted}} for {{neighborhood}} Christmas decorations. Several blocks of Garrison Street near Chatsworth are particularly {{well known for}} elaborate decorations.

5|$|Scales was {{the only}} {{defendant}} convicted under the membership clause. All others were convicted of conspiring to overthrow the government. President Kennedy commuted his sentence on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve,</b> 1962, making Scales the final Smith Act defendant released from prison. Scales is the only Supreme Court decision to uphold a conviction based solely upon membership in a political party.|$|E
5|$|The opera's appeal lay {{not only}} in its story about a {{crippled}} shepherd boy healed on the first <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> but in its wedding of opera and the limitations of television. The broad effects of theater were eschewed and instead an intimacy appropriate to the television studio and home viewing was cultivated. The production starred Chet Allen as Amahl and Rosemary Kuhlmann as his mother. Kuhlmann reprised her role annually for many years.|$|E
5|$|The {{red brick}} Trinity Methodist Church was {{completed}} in 1888. It has survived many troubles, including flooding in its opening year, damage {{on the night of}} 8/9 December 1940 by enemy action, and an arson attack on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> 1980, when the church was only just saved from complete destruction by the presence of a police officer in a patrol car nearby, who managed to call the fire brigade.|$|E
5|$|A 2-octave Schulmerich {{electronic}} carillon {{of twenty-five}} bells {{was installed in}} the tower in June 1958. It was played from the organ console by a carillonneur on Sunday mornings before and after services, {{as well as on}} special occasions, such as <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> and as part of the traditional noontime nationwide peal of church bells on the Fourth of July. Hymns were also played daily on the carillon by a music roll until it was discontinued in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Abdulmutallab left Lagos on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> at 23:00 aboard KLM Flight 588, a Boeing 777 {{bound for}} Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. In Amsterdam, on Christmas Day, Abdulmutallab checked in for Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit with only carry-on luggage. On March24, 2011, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Abdulmutallab chose to attack Detroit because the plane ticket {{there was the}} least expensive of tickets to potential US targets, which included Chicago and Houston. Initially, some media rumored that Abdulmutallab tried to fly to Detroit {{because it was a}} major hub of the U.S. automotive industry.|$|E
5|$|At bedtime on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve,</b> {{the family}} makes last-minute {{preparations}} at home, Marge tells everyone {{that no one}} can open presents until 7 AM and confiscates all of the alarm clocks. However, Bart drinks 12 glasses of water to wake up early and secretly unwraps his gifts, one of which is a remote-controlled fire truck. Bart plays with it until it sprays water on an overloaded electrical socket, causing a fire that engulfs and melts the plastic Christmas tree and all of the presents beneath it. Bart hides the evidence outside beneath the snow in the front yard.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Gian Carlo Menotti was {{commissioned}} by NBC's Opera Theatre to write an opera for television.

Menotti's work was inspired by Hieronymous Bosch's painting, The Adoration of the Magi. The composer himself appeared on-screen to introduce the opera and give the background of the events leading up to its composition. He also brought director Kirk Browning and conductor Thomas Schippers on-camera to thank them.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, an {{advertisement}} encouraging children to call Santa Claus over a special telephone number was printed in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Due to an error, {{the phone number}} that was printed {{was that of the}} Continental Air Defense (CONAD). Colonel Harry Shoup was on duty on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> 1955 and took many calls from children inquiring about Santa. He told his operators to give a current location for Santa Claus to any child who called in. Three years later, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was formed and the NORAD Tracks Santa service continued.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{leading up to}} the 25th, French, German, and British {{soldiers}} crossed trenches to exchange seasonal greetings and talk. In some areas, men from both sides ventured into no man's land on <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> and Christmas Day to mingle and exchange food and souvenirs. There were joint burial ceremonies and prisoner swaps, while several meetings ended in carol-singing. Men played games of football (soccer) with one another, giving {{one of the most memorable}} images of the truce. Peaceful behavior was not ubiquitous; fighting continued in some sectors, while in others the sides settled on little more than arrangements to recover bodies.|$|E

She initially refuses treatment and plans to die quietly, but is eventually persuaded to undergo chemotherapy and makes a full recovery.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Christmas</b> <b>Eve</b> sermon only {{accelerated}} {{the departure of}} church members. A new branch, the United Church of God, was created in 1995 by a conference of departing ministers and named Tkach's one-time associate and former The World Tomorrow presenter, David Hulme, as president. It eventually became {{the largest of the}} groups to break away from the WCG during this period. Although revenues continued to drop, Tkach remained steadfastly committed to the changes that he had implemented.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{revolves}} around a hostage crisis and is largely presented as {{an homage to}} the film Die Hard.
