60|$|With {{the same}} {{noiseless}} care he had exercised in the advance, Gale retreated {{until it was}} safe for him to rise and walk on down the arroyo. He found Blanco Sol contentedly grazing. A heavy dew was falling, and, as the grass was abundant, the horse did not show the usual restlessness and distress after a dry and exhausting day. Gale carried his saddle blankets and bags into the lee of a little greasewood-covered mound, from around which the wind had cut the soil, and here, in a wash, he risked building a small fire. By this time the wind was piercingly cold. Gale's hands were numb and he moved them to and fro in the little blaze. Then he made coffee in a <b>cup,</b> <b>cooked</b> some slices of bacon {{on the end of}} a stick, and took a couple of hard biscuits from a saddlebag. Of these his meal consisted.
