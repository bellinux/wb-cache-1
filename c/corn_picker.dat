50|$|The Home-O-Nize Company {{began in}} the {{production}} of kitchen cabinets; first in Davenport, Iowa, and then in the old US Button Company factory in downtown Muscatine. Following the short-lived production of kitchen cabinets, the company began manufacturing aluminum gas-bottle hoods on contract for Stampings, Inc. With the scrap left over from the hoods, they made flower-identification labels, beverage coasters and recipe card file boxes. For a brief period, The company also produced pick-up attachments for John Deere / Deere & Company combines, Iowa <b>Corn</b> <b>Pickers</b> for Associated Manufacturers Inc., and did contract work for local companies such as Red Jacket, Carver Pump, Collins Radio, G.W. Timmerman and Peter Products. In the end, it was the recipe-file boxes that paved the way for The Home-O-Nize Company’s entry into the office furniture and supply industry.|$|R
50|$|Some tractor {{manufacturers}} produced matching {{equipment that}} could be directly mounted on the tractor. Examples included front-end loaders, belly mowers, row crop cultivators, <b>corn</b> <b>pickers</b> and <b>corn</b> planters. In most cases, these fixed mounts were proprietary and unique to each make of tractor, so an implement produced by John Deere, for example, could not be attached to a Minneapolis Moline tractor. Another disadvantage was mounting usually required some time and labor, resulting in the implement being semipermanently attached with bolts or other mounting hardware. Usually, it was impractical to remove the implement and reinstall it on a day-to-day basis. As a result, the tractor was unavailable for other uses and dedicated to a single use for an appreciable period of time. An implement generally would be mounted {{at the beginning of}} its season of use (such as tillage, planting or harvesting) and removed only when the likely use season had ended.|$|R
50|$|Edmond Quincy V (1808-1877) was an American {{author and}} reformer. He {{was the second}} son of Josiah Quincy III and Eliza Susan Morton Quincy. He was an {{abolitionist}} editor and {{also the author of}} a biography of his father, a romance, Wensley (1854), and The Haunted Adjutant and Other Stories (1885). He was also the inventor of the <b>corn</b> <b>picker</b> during the Agrarian Revolution.|$|E
50|$|In 1894, Avery {{introduced}} a mechanical <b>corn</b> <b>picker</b> which tractor expert Jack Norbeck described as 'so different and unusual {{that at the}} time farmers wouldn't buy it because it would put too many people out of work.' Avery also invented removable piston sleeves for its gas tractors starting in 1916. Other tractor manufacturers eventually adopted the same practice. It also offered the first farm toy ever manufactured as a favor: they gave away miniature Avery tractors, 3 in high and of cast iron, made by Hubley.|$|E
5000|$|Kokomo {{serves as}} the [...] "City of Firsts" [...] in the food {{industry}} as well. In 1928 Walter Kemp, Kemp Brothers Canning Co. developed the first canned tomato juice because of a request by a physician in search for baby food for his clinic. Kokomo {{is also home to}} the first mechanical <b>corn</b> <b>picker</b> which was developed by John Powell in the early 1920s. Kokomo was home to the first Ponderosa Steakhouse, which opened in 1965. Kokomo opened the first McDonald's with a diner inside, locally called [...] "McDiner." [...] This McDonald's theme failed nationally. Eventually, the [...] "McDiner" [...] closed and was converted back to a regular McDonald's restaurant.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{prominent}} tractor division, IH also sold several {{different types of}} farm-related equipment, such as balers, cultivators, combines (self-propelled and pull behind), combine heads, <b>corn</b> shellers, cotton <b>pickers,</b> manure spreaders, hay rakes, crop dusters, disk harrows, elevators, feed grinders, hammer mills, hay conditioners, milking machines, planters, mills, discs, plows, and miscellaneous equipment.|$|R
40|$|The {{historical}} {{trends in}} structure, extent, {{and intensity of}} agricultural mechanization are analyzed in this study. The numbers of tractors, grain combines, <b>corn</b> <b>pickers</b> and picker shellers, pickup balers, and field forage harvesters peaked during the early 1960 s. The decline in their numbers after the 2 ̆ 760 s is brought about mainly by the qualitative changes in those machines. The total tractor horsepower on farms also increased over the period 1963 - 79. Analysis of measures such as acres per horsepower, number of tractors and combines per farm, and acres per tractor and combine indicates that the intensity of machinery-use has increased {{over the last four}} decades. The productivity of machinery input in agricultural production has also increased;Based on the various investment theories, the alternative models of stock adjustment, expectations, and derived demand type are estimated for tractor and other machinery investments at the national and regional levels using 1950 - 77 annual data. Investment demand functions for harvesting machinery are estimated at the national level. Statistical tests for structural change in the machinery investments are performed. The demand elasticities with respect to prices, income and other economic variables are calculated. In general, the other machinery demand is the most elastic and the harvesting machinery demand is the least elastic with respect to their own prices. Harvesting machinery may have a higher priority in the annual machinery purchases of farmers and hence a lower elasticity of demand. In general, the tractor demand elasticity with respect to its own price as well as aggregate crop price is increasing from west to east;Dynamic multipliers expressing the long-lasting effects of the interest rates, price of fuel and oil, and net farm income are calculated for selected machinery investments. The impact and long-term multipliers are also presented;Finally, a block recursive simulation model of the regional farm machinery investments is developed. The relevant variables are selected from agriculture, industry, and economy in general to complete the linkages specified in the model. The regional tractor and other machinery investments and national tractor, harvesting machinery, other machinery, and all machinery investments are predicted up to 1990. The potential effects of six alternative policies of energy prices, support prices and agricultural exports on future farm machinery investments are also analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Inappropriate machine operating, long {{work hours}} and {{decreased}} concentration of machine operators create conditions for getting injured. A <b>corn</b> <b>picker</b> {{is the most}} often cause of hand injuries among agricultural machineries. Material and methods. The study included 43 persons with hand injuries during corn harvest, treated in the four-year period (2006 - 2009). The study subjects were analyzed by sex, age, season, type of injury, affected parts of the hands, length of treatment and data on being trained {{to work with the}} <b>corn</b> <b>picker.</b> Results. In the observed period hand injuries caused by a <b>corn</b> <b>picker</b> occurred 10. 75 times a year on average on the territory gravitating to the Clinical Centre of Vojvodina. The most frequent hand injuries were recorded in male operators, most of them aged 21 - 59, and the greatest number of injuries happened in October According to the type, crushing of hand was the dominant type of injury. Fingers of hand were most frequently grabbed. The average duration of treatment was 14. 37 days, and the majority of patients were treated in hospital up to 14 days. Discussion and Conclusion. The average occurrence of hand injuries reported in this paper is significantly lower than it was reported in one study conducted earlier. The data regarding training to operate the respecti­ve machinery indicate that 93. 2 % of the injured have not been trained appropriately, and 37. 12 % did not have any personal protective devices. Training of farmers to operate agricultural machinery should be carried out continually in future, as it has been regulated by the Law on Safety at Work and Health...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Hand {{injuries}} {{caused by}} corn pickers are relatively rare {{but in most}} cases extensive, with massive tissue destruction. Severe wounds sustained during agricultural work are contaminated, with high incidence of infection. Objective. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the frequency and type of fungal infection in <b>corn</b> <b>picker</b> injuries and their impact on the course and outcome of treatment. Methods. <b>Corn</b> <b>picker</b> hand injuries for the period 2006 - 2012 were analyzed. After setting up clinical suspicion, direct examination of repeated swabs and histopathological analysis of biopsy material were done in order to detect fungi. Results. From the total number of 60 patients, there was a fungal infection in nine of them (which makes 15 % of the total number of patients). Aspergillus spp. was isolated in seven patients, Candida spp. in three, and Mucor spp. in one patient. None of the patients had increased risk factors for developing a fungal infection. In most cases, there was loss of graft and tissue necrosis in previously normally looking wound, after seven or more days. All patients were treated with repeated surgical debridement and concomitant parenteral and topical application of appropriate antifungal agents. There was no need for reamputation in any patient. Conclusion. A high degree of suspicion and a multidisciplinary approach are needed for early diagnosis of fungal infection. Confirmation of diagnosis and the initiation of surgical and appropriate antifungal therapy are essential for a successful outcome...|$|E
