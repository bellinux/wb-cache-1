5000|$|Pontoon Bridge: Rocking and {{splashing}} in the water, the {{pontoon bridge}} crosses {{the water for}} daring explorers near the <b>capstan</b> <b>wheel</b> wreckage.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Capstan</b> <b>Wheel</b> near Hurley, England {{that was}} used to winch boats {{upstream}} past a flash lock. It {{is said to be the}} only one left in England and was restored in 1999.|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} are {{proposed}} some mechanical systems, all certainly {{used in the}} Classic Age, that could be easily adopted to power the siege towers, devices invented by Greek engineers and called Helepolis. These ancient motors are made up by <b>capstans,</b> tread <b>wheels</b> like those used for Greek-Roman cranes and counterweight motors, all installed into the helepolis. The proposed motors are also analyzed from a mechanical {{point of view in}} order to examine, at least theoretically, their effectiveness in such applications...|$|R
50|$|The QIC {{cartridge}} {{is distinguished}} from {{other types of}} tape cartridges {{by the fact that}} it contains an endless drive belt which is moved at a uniform speed by a motorised capstan. Since the belt is in contact with the tape, this ensures both that the tape moves at uniform speed, and that neutral tension is maintained at all times. This is in contrast to cassette tapes or DATs where the tape is moved past the head by a <b>capstan</b> and pinch <b>wheel,</b> but the takeup reel is driven by a servo motor or slipping clutch.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{restoration}} was made possible with the pledge and realisation of support from Chepstow-based steel bridging and infrastructure manufacturer [...] which, {{as part of its}} [...] community support programme, donated time, equipment and paint to enable the stabilisation of the vessel and arrest further deterioration. Mabey Bridge apprentices along with other employees of the company removed the turntable, winch and <b>wheel</b> <b>capstan</b> from the ferry and relocated them to the Mabey Bridge manufacturing facility for refurbishment. The majority of spray guards were similarly removed and relocated. However, some have been left as a template for future rebuilding. Holes were also drilled in the lower hull to drain the ferry of rainwater and Mabey Bridge staff secured the cabins. The winch chain hull tears were sent to be plated.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, {{the stump}} that {{remained}} of De Noord {{was used as}} a watch post by the Germans. After the war, the Schiedam municipality bought the mill with the intention to restore it to grind again. The first phase of restoration began in 1962 where they restored the sail-cross, cap, tie beams, railing and <b>capstan</b> <b>wheel.</b> Roughly ten years later, the windmill was functioning again.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the current}} {{windmill}} {{was built in}} 1803 as a gristmill, a wooden post mill was built in this location around 1400. In 1707, the wooden post mill was torn down and replaced with a stone mill. When this became too small, De Noord was built. In 1930, a diesel engine was added inside the windmill to keep production going {{when there was no}} wind. The engine is currently along the s' Gravelandseweg in Schiedam. From the 1930s and on, wind energy became less and less common, leading to the dismantling of De Noord in 1937. The beams, <b>capstan</b> <b>wheel,</b> cap, sail-cross and railings were all removed at that time.|$|E
50|$|The Helepolis was {{essentially}} a large tapered tower, with each side about 130 feet (41.1 m) high, and 65 feet (20.6 m) wide that was manually pushed into battle. It rested on eight wheels, each 15 feet (4.6 m) high and also had casters, to allow lateral movement as well as direct. The three exposed sides were rendered fireproof with iron plates, and stories divided the interior, connected by two broad flights of stairs, one for ascent and one for descent. The machine weighed 160 tons, and required 3,400 men working in relays to move it, 200 turning a large <b>capstan</b> driving the <b>wheels</b> via a belt, and the rest pushing from behind. The casters permitted lateral movement, so the entire apparatus could be steered towards the desired attack point, while always keeping the siege engines inside aimed at the walls, and the protective body of the machine directly between the city walls and the men pushing behind it.|$|R
