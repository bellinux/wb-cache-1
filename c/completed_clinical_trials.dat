50|$|More than 10,000 {{patients}} worldwide have <b>completed</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> involving RIC, {{and another}} 20,000 {{are enrolled in}} ongoing trials. The first human clinical trial of RIC was conducted by Dr. Redington in pediatric patients undergoing heart surgery at the Hospital for Sick Children. The patients treated with RIC prior to surgery exhibited less heart damage, {{as measured by the}} biomarker troponin, as well as less need for supportive drugs. This trial was followed by others measuring the effects of RIC on rates and outcomes of heart attacks, heart failure, stroke, and cardiothoracic intervention.|$|E
5000|$|In {{clinical}} trials and other scientific studies, an interim analysis is {{an analysis of}} data that is conducted before data collection has been <b>completed.</b> <b>Clinical</b> <b>trials</b> are unusual in that enrollment of patients is a continual process staggered in time.

50|$|Pepstatin, {{which was}} {{described}} in 1972, was the first synthetic renin inhibitor, but poor pharmacokinetic properties prevented it from entering in vivo investigations. The first generation of renin inhibitors, such as H-142, were peptide analogues of angiotensinogen. However, these inhibitors had also limited drug-like properties. Hopes of breakthrough appeared in 1982 when development of the second generation renin inhibitors began. This generation consisted of peptide-like compounds, such as remikiren, enalkiren and zanikiren. They had more drug-like rather than substrate-like properties, and in 1990 they went to clinical trials. The second generation had its limitations and never <b>completed</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b>|$|E
50|$|In July 2007 the FDA held a {{joint meeting}} of the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. FDA {{scientist}} Joy Mele presented a meta analysis examining the cardiovascular risk of rosiglitazone in <b>completed</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> The study found an overall 1.4x increase in risk of cardiovascular ischemic events relative to the control arms. The results were heterogenous, with clear evidence of increased risk relative to placebo but not relative to other diabetes treatments and higher risk associated with combinations of rosiglitazone with insulin or metformin. Based on the 1.4x increased risk relative to control groups, FDA scientist David Graham presented an analysis suggesting that rosiglitazone had caused 83,000 excess heart attacks between 1999 and 2007. The advisory panel voted 20 : 3 that the evidence available indicated that rosiglitazone increased the risk of cardiovascular events and 22 : 1 that the overall risk:benefit ratio of rosiglitazone justified its continued marketing in the United States. The FDA placed restrictions on the drug, including adding a boxed warning about heart attacks, but did not withdraw it.|$|E
50|$|Schöffski’s main {{clinical}} {{interest is}} the treatment of solid tumors and lymphomas. He {{is involved in a}} large number of prospective clinical trials in various tumor types, including orphan malignancies, ranging from phase 0-III. He leads an active phase I-team in Leuven, has a strong interest in multitumor phase II-screening studies, runs complex clinical trials in the field of personalized oncology and registration studies in various malignancies. He coordinates translational research projects associated with new drug development and in diseases such as sarcoma, urogenital and endocrine malignancies, and others. He has been involved in registration trials of antineoplastic agents in a variety of solid tumors. Prof. Schöffski has a strong background in clinical trial methodology. His Laboratory of Experimental Oncology at KU Leuven has a focus on mesenchymal malignancies and has established multiple cell line- or patient-derived xenograft models of soft tissue sarcomas and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, that are used for early drug screening and studies on cancer biology. This laboratory work has been the rationale for a number of ongoing and <b>completed</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b>|$|E

Also recently in <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> was the NVB302 ({{a derivative}} of the lantibiotic actagardine) which is used {{for the treatment of}} Clostridium difficile infection.

50|$|In January 2016 the GAVI Alliance {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Merck under which Merck agreed to provide VSV-EBOV vaccine for future outbreaks of Ebola and GAVI paid Merck US$5 million; Merck will use the funds to <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> and obtain regulatory approval.

50|$|In addition, real <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> may {{indicate}} that a product is unsafe or ineffective, but rarely indicate why or suggest {{how it might be}} improved. As such, a product that fails during <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> may simply be abandoned, even if a small modification would solve the problem. This stifles innovation, decreasing the number of truly original biomedical products presented to the market every year, {{and at the same time}} increasing the cost of development.Analysis through in silico <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> is expected to provide a better understanding of the mechanism that caused the product to fail in testing, and may be able to provide information that could be used to refine the product to such a degree that it could successfully <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An oral {{formulation}} of the drug with cyclodextrin was developed and Ivax and Serono, and then Merck KGgA conducted several clinical studies. Merck KGgA submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency in 2009, which was rejected in 2010, and an appeal was denied in 2011. Likewise Merck KGgA's NDA with the FDA rejected in 2011. [...] The concerns were that several cases of cancer had arisen, and the ratio of benefit to harm was not clear to regulators. The failures with the FDA and the EMA were a blow to Merck KGgA and were {{one of a series}} of events that led to a reorganization, layoffs, and closing the Swiss facility where Serono had arisen. [...] However, several MS clinical trials were still ongoing at the time of the rejections, and Merck KGgA committed to completing them. [...] A meta-analysis of data from clinical trials showed that cladiribine did not increase the risk of cancer at the doses used in the clinical trials. [...] In 2015 Merck KGgA announced it would again seek regulatory approval with data from the <b>completed</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> in hand, and in 2016 the EMA accepted its application for review.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Clinical</b> <b>trials</b> {{are only}} a small part of the {{research}} that goes into developing a new treatment. Potential drugs, for example, first have to be discovered, purified, characterized, and tested in labs (in cell and animal studies) before ever undergoing <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> In all, about 1,000 potential drugs are tested before just one reaches the point of being tested in a <b>clinical</b> <b>trial.</b> [...] For example, a new cancer drug has, on average, six years of research behind it before it even makes it to <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> But the major holdup in making new cancer drugs available is the time it takes to <b>complete</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> themselves. On average, about eight years pass from the time a cancer drug enters <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> until it receives approval from regulatory agencies for sale to the public.
