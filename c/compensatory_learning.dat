The neural model is a fatiguing leaky integrate and fire model, and spontaneous firing emerges from the hypo-fatigue. This spontaneous firing enables the system to move from direct stimula-tion from the environment. A form of Hebbian learning, post-synaptic weighted <b>compensatory</b> <b>learning,</b> is used to support firing in interior neu-rons. A range of numbers of interior neurons performs the task at above 99 % precision. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{still do}} not know how the brain and its {{computations}} are affected by nerve cell deaths and their <b>compensatory</b> <b>learning</b> processes, as these develop in neurodegenerative diseases (ND). <b>Compensatory</b> <b>learning</b> processes are ND symptoms usually observed at a point when the disease has already affected large parts of the brain. We can register symptoms of ND such as motor and/or mental disorders (dementias) and even provide symptomatic relief, though the structural effects of these are in most cases not yet understood. It is very important to obtain early diagnosis, which can provide several years in which we can monitor and partly compensate for the disease 2 ̆ 7 s symptoms, with the help of various therapies. In the case of Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD), in addition to classical neurological tests, measurements of eye movements are diagnostic. We have performed measurements of latency, amplitude, and duration in reflexive saccades (RS) of PD patients. We have compared the results of our measurement-based diagnoses with standard neurological ones.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} <b>compensatory</b> <b>learning</b> {{and shows}} {{how it can}} lead to the formation of Cell Assemblies (CAs) that share neurons. The work starts with standard Hebbian learning then adds a compensatory modifier that forces the total synaptic weight leaving a neuron toward a constant. This enables overlapping CAs because neurons that are in multiple categories have reduced weight stopping Assemblies merging. This provides a biologically plausible learning rule that eases the ability of CAs to overlap. A more complex CA system based on this work, is being developed as part of a current EPSRC grant (EP/D 059720 / 1) ...|$|E

40|$|Using a {{reasonably}} accurate fatiguing leaky integrate and fire (FLIF) neural model, and biologically plausible compensatory Hebbian learning rules, simulations categorise benchmark machine learning data. The FLIF {{model is a}} simple, efficient point model with discrete cycles roughly corresponding to 10 ms. of biological time. The model {{is applied to the}} yeast categorisation task and the results are compared with those of other mature machine learning algorithms, including a new Kohonen net. Synaptic weights are changed following a compensatory Hebbian rule that includes the total synaptic weight of a neuron. The neural model leads to spontaneous neural firing that enables neurons not directly stimulated by the environment {{to be included in the}} neural categorisation circuit. The network is sparsely connected, and broken into two subnets, with the first subnet directly stimulated by the environment, and using <b>compensatory</b> <b>learning</b> based on the strength leaving the neuron. The second subnet initially fires only spontaneously, and uses <b>compensatory</b> <b>learning</b> based on the weight entering the neuron. After learning, new items are categorised based on a Pearson measurement comparing the firing behaviour of the second subnet on trained items, and the test item. The simulation is self-organising using only unsupervised learning.

40|$|Voluntary exercise, {{treadmill}} activity, skills training, {{and forced}} limb use have been utilized in animal studies to promote brain plasticity and functional change. Motor enrichment may prime {{the brain to}} respond more adaptively to injury, in part by upregulating trophic factors such as GDNF, FGF- 2, or BDNF. Discontinuation of exercise in advance of brain injury may cause levels of trophic factor expression to plummet below baseline, which may leave the brain more vulnerable to degeneration. Underfeeding and motor enrichment induce remarkably similar molecular and cellular changes that could underlie their beneficial effects in the aged or injured brain. Exercise begun before focal ischemic injury increases BDNF and other defenses against cell death and can maintain or expand motor representations defined by cortical microstimulation. Interfering with BDNF synthesis causes the motor representations to recede or disappear. Injury to the brain, even in sedentary rats, causes a small, gradual increase in astrocytic expression of neurotrophic factors in both local and remote brain regions. The neurotrophic factors may inoculate those areas against further damage and enable brain repair and use-dependent synaptogenesis associated with recovery of function or <b>compensatory</b> motor <b>learning.</b> Plasticity mechanisms are particularly active during time-windows early after focal cortical damage or exposure to dopamine neurotoxins.

40|$|Abstract — Individuals {{with chronic}} disabilities often use <b>compensatory</b> {{coordination}} patterns <b>learned</b> during the recovery phase, even after their individual muscular control returns. Although these compensatory movements limit {{their ability to}} complete tasks, these individuals {{are not able to}} relearn the correct synergistic coordination patterns because doing so would temporarily compromise task performance. Following our previous work using feedback distortion in a virtual rehabilitation environment to increase the strength and range of motion of disabled individuals, we address the use of this same feedback distortion environment to alter movement coordination patterns. In this paper, we present the methodology and preliminary results showing that (1) ablebodied individuals could be trained to use a different coordination pattern to produce pinching movements, and (2) feedback distortion can alter movements for individual fingers separately during a coordinated movement. These results indicate that our distorted virtual environment may be a powerful rehabilitation tool to convert compensatory movements into movements that utilize all muscles in the normal synergistic patterns...|$|R

Although <b>compensatory</b> movements are <b>learned</b> more quickly early after stroke, {{the role of}} compensatory move-ment patterns in functional recovery is controversial. We investigated the role of compensatory movement patterns in the long-term functional motor recovery after stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Male Wistar rats were subjected to photothrombotic infarction to induce motor and sensorimotor cortex lesions. The rats were given task-specific training. Behavior tests and analyses of compensatory movement patterns (head lift, limb withdrawal impairment, phantom grasps, and pellet chasing) during the single-pellet reaching test were performed 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days post stroke. [Results] Successful retrieval during the single-pellet reaching test was significantly correlated with compensatory movement patterns in stroke groups. Motor cortex stroke showed significant correlation in limb withdrawal impairment and pellet chasing. But, sensorimotor cortex stroke was significant correlation in pellet chasing. [Conclusion] The data suggest that compensatory movements after stroke are correlated with spontaneous recovery. Since some compensatory movement patterns are detrimental to functional recovery, the correct timing of training and control of compensatory movement patterns might be important...|$|R

In the present studies, the responses of the excitatory amino acids, aspartate and glutamate, together with the neuromodulatory sulphonated amino acid, taurine, within the basolateral amygdala, to an odor cue repeatedly associated with acute ethanol injections (2 g/kg, IP) have been investigated by a microdialysis technique combined with HPLC-EC analysis. After presentation of the ethanol-conditioned stimulus, a single IP saline injection induced an immediate and significant increase in the taurine microdialysate content which could be related to the neuromodulatory action of taurine. Furthermore, when the conditioned stimulus was combined with the ethanol injection (2 g/kg, IP), significant increases in both taurine and glutamate microdialysate content were observed and indicated a <b>learned</b> <b>compensatory</b> response to counteract the acute effects of ethanol.

40|$|Background: Hans Asperger drew {{attention}} to individuals who show the core symptoms of autism {{in the presence of}} high verbal intelligence. Methods: A review of the literature explores current issues concerning the diagnosis and nature of Asperger syndrome. Results: The behavioural and neuro-physiological evidence to date suggests that Asperger syndrome is a variant of autism typically occur-ring in high-functioning individuals, and not a separate disorder. One of the problems of diagnosis is that the typical impairment of social communication may be difficult to identify in early childhood, and can be camouflaged in adulthood by <b>compensatory</b> <b>learning.</b> The range and nature of the social impairments in Asperger syndrome are still in need of investigation, but appear to be less severe than in autism. Experimental evidence suggests that individuals with Asperger syndrome may lack an intuitive theory of mind (mentalising), but may be able to acquire an explicit theory of mind. Brain imaging studies pinpoint a network that links medial prefrontal and temporal cortex as the neural substrate of intuitive mentalising. This network shows reduced activation and poor connectivity in Asperger syn-drome. While some individuals with Asperger syndrome have written eloquently about their lives, their ability to talk about their own emotions appears to be impaired (alexithymia). This impairment may be linked to depression and anxiety, which is common in adulthood. Little is as yet known about the ofte...|$|E
40|$|Extinction of {{conditioned}} fear involves new {{learning that}} inhibits {{but does not}} eliminate the original fear memory. This inhibitory learning is thought to require activation of NMDA receptors (NMDAr) within the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, once extinction has been learned, {{the role played by}} the BLA during subsequent extinction procedures remains unknown. The present study examined the role of neuronal activity and NMDAr activation in rats receiving their first or second extinction of context fear. We found that BLA infusion of DL-APV, a competitive antagonist of NMDAr, depressed fear responses at both the first and second extinction. It impaired learning extinction but spared and even facilitated relearning extinction. BLA infusion of muscimol, a GABAA agonist, produced a similar outcome, suggesting that DL-APV not only blocked NMDAr-dependent plasticity but also disrupted neuronal activity. In contrast, infusion of ifenprodil, a more selective antagonist of NMDAr containing the NR 2 B subunit, did not depress fear responses but impaired short- and long-term inhibition of fear at both the first and second extinction. Therefore, we suggest that relearning extinction normally requires NMDAr containing the NR 2 B subunit in the BLA. However, simultaneous blockade of these receptors and neuronal activity in the BLA results in <b>compensatory</b> <b>learning</b> that is able to promote long-term re-extinction. These data are consistent with a current model that attributes fear extinction to interactions between several neural substrates, including the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Select {{functional}} outcome tests {{commonly used}} for evaluating sensorimotor and cognitive capacity in rodents with focal intracerebral ischemic or hemorrhagic injury are described, along with upgrades {{and issues of}} concern for translational research. An {{emphasis is placed on}} careful quantitative and qualitative assessment of acute and long-term behavioral deficits, and on avoidance of frequent pitfalls. Methods for detecting different degrees of injury and treatment-related improvements are included. Determining the true potential of an intervention requires a set of behavioral analyses that can monitor <b>compensatory</b> <b>learning.</b> In a number of preclinical outcome tests, animals can develop remarkably effective “tricks ” that are difficult to detect but frequently lead to dramatic improvements in performance, particularly with repeated practice. However, some interventions may facilitate learning without promoting brain repair, but these may not translate into a meaningful level of benefit in the clinic. Additionally, it is important to determine whether there are any preinjury functional asymmetries in order to accurately assess damage-related changes in behavior. This is illustrated by the fact that some animals have chronic endogenous asymmetries and that others, albeit infrequently, can sustain a spontaneous cerebral stroke, without any experimental induction, that can lead to chronic deficits as reflected by behavioral, imaging, and histological analyses. Finally, a useful new modification of the water maze that involves moving the platform from trial to trial within the target quadrant is reviewed, and its advantages over the standard version ar...|$|E

Few studies have examined the relationship between college students 2 ̆ 7 self-regulatory behavior and academic achievement, as most research efforts have concentrated on elementary, middle, and high school students. Only one study has identified compensation strategies used by successful students with learning disabilities (LD) in a college environment. No studies have investigated the question of whether university students with and without LD use the same or different learning strategies to succeed in a learning environment.

Early Childhood Education in New Zealand Curriculum for Practice Why all the fuss about curriculum? Curriculum as a philosophical statement, as a tool for accountability, or as a foundation for the total learning experience, curriculum documents are here to stay. Historically educational practice has always been driven by the philosophy or the underlying “theme of the times ” (Heaslip, 1997). In early childhood education in particular, beliefs of recent times included: • 1960 s: a period of <b>compensatory</b> <b>learning,</b> providing for what was perceived to be lacking in the home • 1970 s: an emphasis on language and the implications on early learning of the stages of language development • 1980 s/ 90 s: a need for curriculum-based learning and the use of curricula as a framework for the processes of learning. The early childhood curriculum, Te Whaariki (Ministry of Education, 1996), is the first national curriculum statement for the early childhood sector in New Zealand and as such has provided the beginning of an exciting era for early childhood education. The key feature of Te Whaariki is that it espouses a child-centred approach, sensitive to the holistic development and learning of the child...|$|E
40|$|This thesis proposes and {{implements}} {{methods for}} the autonomous identification and classification of disturbances that have {{negative effects on}} a robot’s performance (self-diagnosis), and the autonomous selection of suitable compensatory actions (self-compensation). The proposed methods have been implemented in a walking hexapod robot provided {{with a number of}} sensors. Both, the robot’s sensorial information and a quantitative measure of the robot’s performance are obtained. This information is used for detecting, identifying and classifying obstructive conditions that have a strong impact on the robot’s performance. Once the cause of a lack of progress in the robot’s mission has been identified, suitable compensatory actions are found, executed and recorded. Then, when previously experienced detrimental situations arise, the associated compensatory measures are immediately taken without involving a searching process. As a result, the recovery from abnormal conditions is accelerated and the robot can promptly continue with its mission. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, different sets of experiments addressing the robot’s hardware faults, abnormal situations generated in the robot’s environment and a combination of both, were conducted. Results were evaluated by means of two indicators: the number of attempts before a correct identification of the robot’s hardware fault was achieved, and a discrepancy measure. The latter indicates the Euclidean distance between the centroid of an abnormal situation experienced by the robot and the centroid of abnormal situations incorporated into the robot’s database of anomalies. Results showed a good identification rate inside the repertoire of considered abnormal situations. Among the compensatory measures addressed in this thesis, an adaptable gait generation algorithm which allows legged robots to walk in a stable fashion after they have shed a variable number of legs, and a compact leg release mechanism that provides legged robots with a method for the autonomous physical ejection of damaged legs without requiring extra motors, are proposed. Two self-compensating methods (Autonomous Generated <b>Compensatory</b> Measures and <b>Learned</b> Compensating Measures) not implemented into the experimental robot are proposed in this thesis. In theory, these methods will allow robots to autonomously generate <b>compensatory</b> measures and <b>learn</b> from previously encountered abnormal situations. The methods developed in this research are fundamental for the autonomous detection of a robot’s failures and adaptability to unforeseen features of the robot’s environment. By using these techniques, it is expected to increase resilience to damage, extend lifespan and improve autonomy in robotic missions where human intervention is difficult or impossible, such as in extra-terrestrial exploration or other remote hostile environments...|$|R
40|$|As China {{progresses}} toward learner-centered pedagogy, {{understanding how}} learners learn and what influences their learning has become {{just as important}} as determining what they learn. This is especially true in the context of English as a foreign language in China. In this context, knowledge of English has increasingly become a tool for participation in the international arena, and the number of English language learners is growing at an unprecedented rate. In addition, research on Chinese learners of English is receiving mounting attention. This dissertation explored the relationships among learners' use of language learning strategies, attitudes, motivations, beliefs about language learning, and English language proficiency for 1, 201 university students in China. Group differences and manifestations of these variables in individual learners were also examined. Findings of this study suggested that two sources of influence were the most powerful in relation to learners' use of language learning strategies: (a) ability beliefs, and (b) motivational orientations, especially orientation toward competition and academic self-efficacy. These two factors, i. e., ability beliefs and the abovementioned motivational orientation, in conjunction with two other factors, intrinsic motivation and <b>compensatory</b> vocabulary <b>learning</b> strategy use, accounted for {{a significant portion of the}} variance in English language proficiency in the latent variable path analysis. Findings also suggested that a multitude of contextual issues, such as English curriculum, national standardized English tests, the status of English as an international language, classroom language instruction, and peer influence, interplayed to affect learners' strategy use, motivational orientations, and attitudes about language learning, resulting in distinct dimensions and patterns. Results of this study speak cogently to the need for language pedagogy in China to explicitly integrate strategy instruction and address the motivational aspect of language learning for the purpose of engaging learners and enhancing learning effectiveness. Future research should systematically examine patterns and sources of variation in these learner variables as well as identify their developmental trajectories...|$|R
40|$|Implicit mentalizing, a fast, {{unconscious}} and rigid way of processing other's mental states has recently received {{much interest in}} typical social cognitive development in early childhood and in adults with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). This research suggests that already infants implicitly mentalize, and that adults with ASC have a sustained implicit mentalizing deficit. Yet, we have only sparse empirical evidence on implicit mentalizing beyond early childhood, and deviations thereof in children with ASC. Here, we administered an implicit mentalizing eye tracking task to assess the sensitivity to false beliefs {{to a group of}} 8 -year-old children with and without ASC, matched for chronological age, verbal and nonverbal IQ. As previous research suggested that presenting outcomes of belief-based actions leads to fast learning from experience and false belief-congruent looking behavior in adults with ASC, we were also interested in whether already children with ASC learn from such information. Our results provide support for a persistent implicit mentalizing ability in neurotypical development beyond early childhood. Further, they confirmed an implicit mentalizing deficit in children with ASC, even when they are closely matched to controls for explicit mentalizing skills. In contrast to previous findings with adults, no experience-based modulation of anticipatory looking was observed. It seems that children with ASC have not yet developed <b>compensatory</b> general purpose <b>learning</b> mechanisms.

40|$|It is {{generally}} admitted that procedural learning is efficient early in childhood. However, {{few studies have}} brought empirical data confirming this assumption, and many questions remain regarding the cognitive mechanisms that sustain procedural learning in children. The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} whether perceptual-motor procedural learning was present to the same extent in 7 -, 10 -year-old children and in adults. We also examined the role of executive functions, working memory, general intelligence, and motor ability during the learning process. A total of 76 subjects divided into 3 age-groups were tested. The task included 4 blocks of 3 trials during which each subject had to trace the contour of a triangle with an inverted computer mouse. Analyses show an important difference between groups in the initial phase of the learning process. They also reveal that executive functions intervene during the first learning phase, which might explain the observed age effect. In addition, results show significant but different learning effects for the procedural task: while the improvement was equivalent between 10 -year-olds and adults, 7 -year-old children showed a greater learning slope than the other groups; despite their slowness during the first blocks, younger children showed an equivalent performance {{at the end of the}} learning phase. These results suggest that, if executive processes are important during the first learning steps, they are not a “necessary condition” for motor skill learning to occur. The role of <b>compensatory</b> strategies sustaining <b>learning</b> in younger children is discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|R

METHODS/DESIGN: Eye-tracking glasses are used to delineate eye movements in a cohort of 100 stroke patients immediately after stroke, and additionally at 6 and 12 months post-stroke. The longitudinal study will assess eye movements in static (sitting) and dynamic (walking) conditions. The primary outcome constitutes the change of lateral eye movements from the acute to chronic stages of stroke. Secondary outcomes include changes of lateral eye movements over time as a function of subgroup characteristics, such as side of VFD, stroke location, stroke severity and cognitive functioning. DISCUSSION: The longitudinal comparison of patients who do and do not <b>learn</b> <b>compensatory</b> scanning techniques may reveal important prognostic markers of natural recovery. Importantly, it may also help to determine the most effective treatment window for visual rehabilitation.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issue of using {{interactive}} technologies in the process of training interpreters. Nowadays with the integration of Ukraine into the European space interpreter training faces new challenges as it is to provide society with highly qualified specialists who are able not only to render information from one language into another, but to conduct professionally cross-cultural communication. To perform their functions properly interpreters have to master various language skills and gain professional competences and communicative competence {{is one of the most}} important. It is understood as mastering of ethno-social and psychological models and patterns, standards of verbal behaviour and their appliance. The structure of professional communicative competence of an interpreter includes the following five components: linguistic (language) competence; thematic competence, providing extra linguistic information; socio-cultural competence; <b>compensatory</b> competence and <b>learning</b> competence. All of these competences are realized in the process of professional communication that may be defined as the degree of perfection, which manifests itself in following the science-developed recommendations for the effective organization and implementation of interactive communication while solving professional tasks and problems. Interactive learning technologies can promote verbal communicative competence of the future interpreters as they provide active communication in the educational process. They may be divided into interactive technologies of cooperative education; interactive technologies of group training; interactive technologies of situational modelling; technologies of working at controversial issues. Interactive technologies form skills and develop social values, create an atmosphere of cooperation and collaboration. These technologies, involve modelling situations, using role-playing, solving joint problems, sharing and discussing ideas. So during training interpreters learn to communicate with others, think critically and creatively, make well-ground, sound decisions...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{interaction}} of limb segments during movements that involve multiple joints creates torques in one joint due to motion about another. Evidence shows that such interaction torques {{are taken into}} account during the planning or control of movement in humans. Two alternative hypotheses could explain the compensation of these dynamic torques. One involves the use of internal models to centrally compute predicted interaction torques and their explicit compensation through anticipatory adjustment of descending motor commands. The alternative, based on the equilibrium-point hypothesis, claims that descending signals can be simple and related to the desired movement kinematics only, while spinal feedback mechanisms are responsible for the appropriate creation and coordination of dynamic muscle forces. Partial supporting evidence exists in each case. However, until now no model has explicitly shown, {{in the case of the}} second hypothesis, whether peripheral feedback is really sufficient on its own for coordinating the motion of several joints while at the same time accommodating intersegmental interaction torques. Here we propose a minimal computational model to examine this question. Using a biomechanics simulation of a two-joint arm controlled by spinal neural circuitry, we show for the first time that it is indeed possible for the neuromusculoskeletal system to transform simple descending control signals into muscle activation patterns that accommodate interaction forces depending on their direction and magnitude. This is achieved without the aid of any central predictive signal. Even though the model makes various simplifications and abstractions compared to the complexities involved in the control of human arm movements, the finding lends plausibility to the hypothesis that some multijoint movements can in principle be controlled even in the absence of internal models of intersegmental dynamics or <b>learned</b> <b>compensatory</b> motor signals...|$|R
40|$|Unilateral neglect (UN) {{refers to}} an {{inability}} to orient the attention to stimuli in the contralesional hemispace. This may severely impair the performance of everyday tasks. UN is most common and severe after right brain damage. The general aim of this dissertation was to explore some aspects of importance for the rehabilitation of patients with UN and to develop and evaluate strategies for assessment and intervention. In study I, we developed {{a new type of}} neglect assessment, the Baking Tray Task (BTT), presented normative data and compared the BTT with standard neglect tests in a consecutive series of 52 brain-damaged patients. BTT seems to be a sensitive method for identifying extrapersonal neglect. The study also verified the importance of using several different types of tasks in the assessment of UN. Study II evaluated a training strategy {{based on the assumption that}} patients with persistent UN also have impaired sustained attention, which interferes with their ability to learn and to use strategies to compensate for their UN. In this experimental case study, all the eight patients improved in both sustained attention and UN. The aim of study III was to explore the motivation for training in four patients with UN. A qualitative approach was used. The findings suggest that motivation is a complex phenomenon, which is closely related to awareness of disabilities. In study IV, we examined if video feedback is a useful tool to give patients feedback on their neglect behaviour during task performance. Video technique allows the patients to see the left side of the task on the right side of the TV monitor. Video feedback seems to be a useful method for helping patients to become more aware of their disabilities related to UN. In study V, an attempt was made to train awareness of disabilities in everyday tasks. The assumption was that many patients with UN are unaware of their disabilities, which interferes with their engagement in <b>learning</b> <b>compensatory</b> strategies in everyday tasks. We found that training seems to improve not only awareness of disabilities, but also UN and ADL ability. In the phenomenological study VI, four patients with UN described how they experienced and discovered their disabilities and how they learned to handle them in everyday life. The study describes the features of a discovery process. Patients needed to experience their disabilities in the context of everyday life to become more aware of them and to learn how to use compensatory strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to examine the}} {{capacity}} for acquisition and retention of practice-related improvements in compensatory posture control and the nature of postural motor learning among healthy young and older adults repeatedly exposed to continuous surface motion via a translating platform. Although much research has been conducted to examine the strategies adopted by the central nervous system to control posture in response to external perturbations, the learning capabilities of this system have remained relatively unexplored. Many of the studies that have explored practice-related changes in balance performance have focused on short-term adaptations to highly predictable stimuli. Borrowing from implicit sequence learning paradigms, we developed two experimental protocols to examine postural motor <b>learning</b> for a <b>compensatory</b> balance task in an environment with limited predictability. Applying key principles of motor learning to our experimental design including retention intervals and a transfer task enabled us to draw conclusions about the permanency and specificity of the observed changes. Our investigations revealed practice-related changes in the motor organization of posture control. In young adults, a shift in the complexity of the control strategy occurred which lead to improvements in spatial and temporal control of the COM. In contrast, a majority of older adults persisted with a simplified control strategy which restricted improvements in COM control. Importantly, despite control strategy differences, the two groups showed comparable rates of improvement in almost all outcome measures including measures of trunk stability and temporal COM control. Longer-term retention of behavioural changes provided evidence for learning in young adults. Similar maintenance of improvements was observed for some outcome measures in older adults. Where significant losses in performance occurred in this group, retention was evident in the rapid reacquisition of performance to the level of proficiency achieved in original practice. Based on these results, we concluded that age affected the adapted control strategy but not the capacity for postural motor learning. Further, regardless of age or protocol, the pattern of postural perturbations did not influence acquisition of a strategy of stability and thus, we concluded that postural motor learning under the current conditions was non-specific, that is, it did not involve sequence-specific learning. These results provide important insight into the generalized nature of <b>compensatory</b> postural motor <b>learning</b> and subsequently, into the potential for positive transfer of balance skill to other balance tasks...|$|R
