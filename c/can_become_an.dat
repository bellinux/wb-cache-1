5|$|The game {{opens with}} a {{terrorist}} attack on Chicago by the Knights Templar; a nanite bomb turns the entire city into grey goo, with the staff and trainees of the city's Tarsus Academy facility barely escaping in time. After relocating to Tarsus' Seattle facility, the city's own Tarsus facility is attacked by soldiers of the Order. Alex, discovering with Billie's help that Tarsus has been observing their trainees in secret {{under the guidance of}} Nassif, escapes the facility and is subsequently offered missions by Tarsus, the Order, the WTO, and the Omar. During these missions, Alex learns that their biomods were created by ApostleCorp, and follows Nassif from Seattle to Cairo, which is being disrupted by fighting between the factions. Alex's fellow students follow different paths during the narrative; Billie initially allies with the Order before joining the Knights Templar, Klara joins the WTO, while Leo becomes involved with the Omar and <b>can</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> unwilling convert.|$|E
5|$|Momohime's {{story begins}} after {{she wakes up}} Kyo with {{memories}} of being killed by the dying Jinkuro when he was aiming for her betrothed, the samurai lord Yukinojo. Upon encountering the spirit of Jinkuro, he forcefully possesses her, but before the process of soul transference is finished, they are attacked. In the confusion, Momohime's soul is kidnapped by the vengeful monk Rankai and Jinkuro is forced to follow Kongiku as Momohime's body will die if her soul is harmed. With her soul safe, Jinkuro sets out to regain the Dark Resurrection Demon Blade so he can properly utilize his Soul Transference Technique and gain influence through a new host. Encountering Yukinojo, who is searching for Momohime, the two battle. Momohime forces Jinkuro to spare Yukinojo, even when she learns that Yukinojo's intentions in marrying her {{were part of a}} scheme to ruin her family as punishment for defying the shogun. Jinkuro goes to Yukinojo's compound to retrieve the Dark Resurrection, but the storehouse where it is said to be is absorbed into Yomi by demons. Descending into Yomi, Jinkuro's soul is briefly captured by a demon, and it is only with Momohime's help that he escapes and learns that the Dark Resurrection was never in the storehouse. With Momohime's body beginning to fail due to the strain Soul Transference put on it, Jinkuro attempts to ascent to Heaven so he <b>can</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> immortal demon, but is stopped by Raijin and Fujin.|$|E

500|$|In {{the film}} Madsen tried to {{challenge}} the idea of war as [...] "black and white" [...] {{and the idea that}} the resistance was [...] "a cohesive whole". He says of war that it [...] "has many more nuances, it is grayer, less defined. When an enemy may stop being one at any time and a friend <b>can</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> enemy overnight, things become less clear". Ella Taylor of The Village Voice commented, [...] "Flame & Citron is less about the battle between good and evil than about losing one's way in the fog of war, which makes it hard to tell friend from foe and harder yet to sort through the rules of engagement, and complicates the heroic honor codes of movies about the 'good war.'" [...] Marshall Fine of The Huffington Post asserted that the violence in the film is double-edged: [...] " [...] takes its toll on the perpetrator as well as the victim." [...] Similarly, The Irish Timess Derek Scally stated the film analyses [...] "the dehumanising effect of assassinations on assassin".|$|E

Occupying {{the role of}} the film's female lead, Nala is The Lion Kings most important female character, who contributes to the film's [...] "small romance element". Often identified as the film's deuteragonist, Taylor Orci of The Atlantic felt that [...] "Nala is really the agent of change in The Lion King", dismissing Simba as a [...] "rich, lazy boyfriend." [...] Leab observed that The Lion Kings male characters tend to [...] "take the center stage" [...] while [...] "female characters take a backseat to the action." [...] Lenka Křivánková of Masaryk University wrote in her thesis [...] "1990s Hollywood Break-Away Hits: A Feminist Perspective" [...] that she was not particularly surprised by the film's lack of strong roles for women because of its Shakespearean source material, dubbing the film [...] "an old traditional fairy tale with all its traditional features", including patriarchy and monarchism. Writing for the University of Waterloo's Kinema, Vicky Wong believes that Nala reinforces the film's [...] "take your place" [...] motif, reminding main character Simba of his responsibilities. In his book Retelling Stories, Framing Culture: Traditional Story and Metanarratives in Children's Literature, author John Stephens credits Nala with teaching Simba about responsibility – [...] "the lesson the hero must learn before he <b>can</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> adult".|$|E

2500|$|.....shame is {{important}} because no other affect is more disturbing to the self, none more central for the sense of identity. In the context of normal development, shame {{is the source of}} low self-esteem, diminished self image, poor self concept, and deficient body-image. Shame itself produces self-doubt and disrupts both security and confidence. It <b>can</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> impediment to the experience of belonging and to shared intimacy....It is the experiential ground from which conscience and identity inevitably evolve. In the context of pathological development, shame is central to the emergence of alienation, loneliness, inferiority and perfectionism. It plays a central role in many psychological disorders as well, including depression, paranoia, addiction, and borderline conditions. Sexual disorders and many eating disorders are largely disorders of shame. Both physical abuse and sexual abuse also significantly involve shame.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{publication}} of [...] "Towards and Adequate Interventionist [...] Practice" [...] (1985), Barber has explored the radical potential of performance.

[...] Depending on the circumstances {{and the type of}} event, intervention <b>can</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> exemplary action, and thus devolve into a form of political posturing, closely implicated in extreme versions of behaviour characterized by violence, anarchic rejection or destructive nihilism. [...] While exemplary actions are usually without theoretical support, interventions attempt to put theory into action. [...] The intentions and ultimately the audience response are different. [...] The exemplary action consists, instead of intervening in an overall way, in acting in a much more concentrated way on exemplary objectives, on a few key objectives that will play a determining role in the continuation of the struggle.|$|E
2500|$|From 1870 to 1900, as the American {{college system}} moved from small schools to a larger, diverse set of {{universities}} with distinct academic disciplines, {{the field of}} composition studies grew from traditional rhetorical studies. As pioneers {{in the field of}} composition studies, Harvard University enacted a new program in their English department that, for the first time, made “a total commitment to writing,” though the initial focus was on personal writing and did not include rhetoric or literary analysis. However, the field of composition studies soon became paired with the field of rhetoric as the modern university developed, because scholars began to realize that elements of rhetoric and not “systematic grammatical study” were necessary to improve writing and composition abilities. While rhetoric traditionally concerned matters related to verbal orations or speeches, both rhetoric and composition are related to the expression of ideas, often in an attempt to influence one’s audience. In addition, composition is also concerned with the principles of invention, arrangement, style, and delivery traditionally associated with rhetoric; even memory <b>can</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> element of composition when one is writing a speech or a scholarly paper to be delivered orally. [...] Thus, rhetoric and composition— colloquially termed “rhet/comp” or “comp/rhet”— became a field of its own and remains a burgeoning discipline in universities today.|$|E
2500|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis caused {{a delay in}} the schedule for adoption of the euro {{for most of the}} new EU members. The convergence progress for the newly accessed EU member states, is supported and evaluated by the yearly submission of the [...] "Convergence programme" [...] under the Stability and Growth Pact. As a general rule, the majority of economic experts recommend for newly accessed EU member states with a forecasted era of catching up and a past record of [...] "macroeconomic imbalance" [...] or [...] "financial instability", that these countries first use some years to address these issues and ensure [...] "stable convergence", before taking the next step to join the ERM-II, and as the final step (when complying with all convergence criteria) ultimately adopt the euro. In practical terms, any non-euro EU member state <b>can</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> ERM-II member whenever they want, as this mechanism does not define any criteria to comply with. Economists however consider it to be more desirable for [...] "unstable countries", to maintain their flexibility of having a floating currency, rather than getting an inflexible and partly fixed currency as an ERM-II member. Only at the time of being considered fully [...] "stable", the member states will be encouraged to enter into ERM-II, in which they need to stay for a minimum of two years without presence of [...] "severe tensions" [...] for their currency, {{while at the same time}} also ensuring compliance with the other four convergence criteria, before finally being approved to adopt the euro.|$|E
