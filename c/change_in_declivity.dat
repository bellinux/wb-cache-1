40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the manifest refractive error (ΔM), the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power (ΔACP) and initial corneal asphericity (Q) in overnight orthokeratology (ortho-K). Methods: One hundred and twenty-eight clinical records of children undergoing ortho-K from a university optometry clinic were reviewed. The refractive and topographical data at baseline and at two-week visit of 58 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and analysed. Results: Significant differences (p < 0. 001) between the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error and <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> the apical corneal power or the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power (ΔMCP) within the treatment zone were found. Linear regression analysis was used to describe the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power, and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error and the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power, with the equations: ΔM = 0. 91 ΔACP + 0. 57 (r = 0. 78, p < 0. 001) and ΔM = 0. 93 ΔMCP + 0. 01 (r = 0. 79, p < 0. 001) respectively. On average, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power underestimated the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error by 0. 34 ± 0. 57 D; whereas on average, the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power overestimated the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error by 0. 23 ± 0. 57 D (paired-t-tests, p < 0. 001). A low but significant correlation between initial corneal asphericity and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error (Spearman r = - 0. 33, p = 0. 01) was observed. Conclusions: The <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power underestimates the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error in ortho-K, whereas the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power overestimates this parameter. Compared with retinoscopy and autorefraction, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power is still useful for estimation of the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error. Although the maximum <b>change</b> <b>in</b> corneal power appears to give a closer estimation of the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error than the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> apical corneal power, there is no advantage in the use of maximum corneal power (manually located) instead of apical corneal power (a default given by the topographer) to estimate the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> manifest refractive error, as there is {{no significant difference in the}} estimations by either parameter.
