50|$|<b>Carbenicillin</b> is a {{bactericidal}} antibiotic {{belonging to}} the carboxypenicillin subgroup of the penicillins. It was discovered by scientists at Beecham and marketed as Pyopen. It has Gram-negative coverage which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa but limited Gram-positive coverage. The carboxypenicillins are susceptible to degradation by beta-lactamase enzymes, although they are more resistant than ampicillin to degradation. <b>Carbenicillin</b> is also more stable at lower pH than ampicillin.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, <b>carbenicillin</b> may be preferred as a selecting agent (see Plasmid stabilisation technology) {{because its}} breakdown results in byproducts {{with a lower}} toxicity than analogous antibiotics like ampicillin. <b>Carbenicillin</b> is more stable than ampicillin and results in fewer satellite colonies on selection plates. However, in most situations {{this is not a}} significant problem so ampicillin is sometimes used due to its lower cost.|$|E

50|$|<b>Carbenicillin</b> {{is used in}} {{the clinic}} {{primarily}} because of its low toxicity and its utility in treating urinary tract infections due to susceptible Pseudomonas species. Its low potency, low oral activity, and susceptibility to bacterial beta-lactamases make it vulnerable to replacement by agents without these deficits. One contender in this race is ticaricillin. Its origin depended on the well-known fact that a divalent sulfur is roughly equivalent to a vinyl group (cf methiopropamine, sufentanil, pizotyline etc.).One synthesis began by making the monobenzyl ester of 3-Thienylmalonic acid, converting this to the acid chloride with SOCl2, and condensing it with 6-Aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA). Hydrogenolysis (Pd/C) completed the synthesis of ticarcillin.|$|E
5000|$|... == Metabolism == D. donghaensis {{performs}} light-driven {{sodium ion}} transport. This light-driven proton pump {{is called a}} proteorhodopsin, which increases the organism’s survival rate because it can convert light into energy that the organism needs to grow. Since the organism uses light for energy, it is a phototroph. D. donghaensis is able to secrete enzymes such as catalase and oxidase. Since the organism is a strict aerobe, it used oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. The organism can grow on peptone and tryptone as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources. D. donghaensis cannot grow {{in the absence of}} NaCl or when it is greater than 7% (w/v); growth is optimal at 2% (w/v) NaCl. The organism is susceptible to the antibiotics tetracycline and <b>carbenicillin,</b> although the organism's ability to form biofilms makes it difficult for antibiotics to penetrate the viscous layers.|$|E
5000|$|One {{important}} consideration {{to determine the}} safety of Lactobacillus fermentum is transferable resistant genes. In order for [...] L. fermentum to {{be considered as a}} potential probiotic, it must not contain any transferable resistant genes. If a resistance gene is transferable, it could lessen the effect of the use of antibiotics. Out of ten common antibiotic genes that were tested (gatamicin, cefazolin, penicillin, trimethoprim/sulfmethoxazole, ampicillin, <b>carbenicillin,</b> erythromycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and norfloxacin), Lactobacillus fermentum was found to only be resistant to amikacin and norfloxacin. Others studies have reported that most LABs are also resistant to these antibiotics, which led to the conclusion that it was a common characteristic of LABs. The resistance to these antibiotics can be considered natural or intrinsic. So far no observed Lactobacillus fermentum strains have been observed to have transferable resistance or acquired resistance genes ...|$|E

He further showed that overuse of a new antibiotic led to increased staphylococcus resistance, and that a subsequent reduction in use reversed the effect.

5000|$|The {{only other}} group besides Woods' to report {{successful}} 7 day storage of kidneys was Liu and Humphries [...] in 1973. They had 3 out of 7 dogs surviving, after their kidneys had been stored for 7 days followed by reimplantation and immediate contralateral nephrectomy. Their best dog had a peak post reimplantation creatinine of 50 mg/l (0.44 mmol/l). Liu used well hydrated dogs undergoing a mannitol diuresis and stored the kidneys at 9 °C - 10 °C using a perfusate derived from human PPF. The PPF was further fractionated {{by using a}} highly water-soluble polymer (Pluronic F-38), and sodium acetyl tryptophanate and sodium caprylate {{were added to the}} PPF as stabilisers to permit pasteurisation. To this solution were added human albumin, heparin, mannitol, glucose, magnesium sulphate, potassium chloride, insulin, methyl prednisolone, <b>carbenicillin,</b> and water to adjust the osmolality to 300-310 mosmol/kg. The perfusate was exchanged after 3.5 days storage. Perfusate pressure was 60 mm Hg or less, at a pump rate of 60 per minute. Perfusate pH was 7.12-7.32 (at 37 °C), Pco2 27-47 mm Hg, and Po2 173-219 mm Hg. In a further report on this study Humphries [...] found that when the experiments were repeated with a new batch of PPF no survivors were obtained, and histology of the survivors from the original experiment showed glomerular hypercellularity which he attributed to a possible toxic effect of the Pluronic polymer.|$|E

40|$|Indanyl <b>carbenicillin,</b> a new semisynthetic penicillin, is an orally {{effective}} {{derivative of}} <b>carbenicillin.</b> This ester is acid-stable and rapidly absorbed from the gastro-intestinal tract and is hydrolyzed in vivo to produce <b>carbenicillin</b> and metabolic by-products derived from indanoI. Orally administered indanyl <b>carbenicillin</b> provides the same therapeutic effect as parenterally administered disodium <b>carbenicillin</b> in experimental systemic infections of mice and in urinary-tract infections of rats. Since <b>carbenicillin</b> was introduced into medicine, it has gained rapid acceptance {{as an effective}} and nontoxic agent {{for the treatment of}} serious gram-negative infections, especially those caused by Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, and Proteus spe-cies. However, despite its proven clinical value, <b>carbenicillin</b> has shortcomings that result from its chemical structure. It is an unstable substance, readily destroyed by acid and gastric juice, and it is very water soluble, which precludes its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract [1]. Furthermore, its tendency to decarboxylate and degrade in acid solutions and its poor lipophilicity seriously complicate the manufacturing processes.
