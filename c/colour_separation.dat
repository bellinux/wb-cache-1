50|$|This {{story is}} the first to be {{recorded}} using colour studio cameras. The previous serial, Spearhead from Space, was the first in colour, but was shot entirely on location (i.e., outside the electronic TV studio), and on film (as opposed to videotape, the standard method for recording Doctor Who). Due to the move to colour, the production team made use of a technique known as <b>Colour</b> <b>Separation</b> Overlay (CSO, or Chroma key), which allowed images to be superimposed over each other using <b>colour</b> <b>separation.</b> This was used extensively in the series for many years, beginning with this serial.|$|E

40|$|Summary: For {{material}} to be offset printed, the masters {{need to be}} prepared as <b>colour</b> <b>separations,</b> one for each coloured ink. Production of the masters is a time consuming task, often performed by hand. A method is proposed to enable separations to be automatically prepared if the source material is available as a colour PostScript file. The method uses any black-and-white PostScript printer, and two header files, the first defining procedures to be used in preparing the separation, and the second selecting the <b>colour</b> of the <b>separation</b> desired. The method works with any colour Level 1 PostScript documents. Background Offset printing in colour is most frequently achieved by separately printing the chosen inks onto the final piece of paper. Separate plates are made up for each of the colours, and they must be carefully aligned or registered to reproduce the desired combination of colours. If you have an original illustration or manuscript in colour, the printer must manually separate the colours into the separate plates for reproduction. This is a slow and expensive process. Printers prefer to be given the originals already separated into the component colours. If you are producing the material on a computer for later reproduction by offset printing...|$|R

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of photographic material {{in a book}} or similar publication is an expensive process and, unless care is taken, artefacts can be introduced into the reproduction.

This paper discusses these problems and compares halftoning with T) $ to other techniques such as direct {{inclusion of}} Postscript. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches are described, taking account of the need for low-resolution drafts from laser printers and high-resolution final output from typesetters. Given the ability to generate halftoned output, it is but a small step to consider including colour pictures in documents.

30|$|The Russian icon {{was chosen}} as a test object for the study because of its {{particular}} physical and material characteristics. Instead of a matte finish, it has a medium gloss on the painted areas and a shiny metallic finish on the gold. There is {{a wide range of}} tones and colours, including skin tones and a pictorial realism to the figures, which make it suitable for image quality assessment. The fine spatial detail in both the half-tone <b>colour</b> <b>separations</b> and the filigree gold decoration are appropriate for testing the optical resolving power of an imaging system. The surface is flat, almost planar, with virtually no 3 D relief, and it has a convenient size and format. Because it is a common mass-produced object, rather than a fragile artwork, it can be handled freely by researchers in the laboratory without gloves. It {{turned out to be a}} very demanding test object, revealing several critical aspects of system performance.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} factor for a key is the <b>colour</b> <b>separation</b> of the foreground (the subject) and background (the screen) - a bluescreen will be used if the subject is predominately green (for example plants), despite the camera being more sensitive to green light.|$|E

50|$|A Gift From a Flower to a Garden is {{the fifth}} album from British singer-songwriter Donovan, and marks the first double album of his career {{and one of the}} first box sets in rock music.

In December 1967, Epic Records also released each of the two records from A Gift From a Flower to a Garden as separate albums in the US. The first record was released as Wear Your Love Like Heaven, and the second record was released as For Little Ones. This was done to allow budgeting for the double album package, which included a folder of the printed lyrics to the second disc with artwork, and a cover featuring an infrared photo of Donovan by Karl Ferris who was his and Jimi Hendrix's personal photographer (requiring six <b>colour</b> <b>separations</b> for printing, instead of the usual four separations).|$|R

40|$|In packaging, spot colours {{are used}} to print key {{information}} like brand logos and elements for which the colour accuracy is critical. The present study investigates methods to aid the accurate reproduction of these spot colours with the n-colour printing process. Typical n-colour printing systems consist of supplementary inks {{in addition to the}} usual CMYK inks. Adding these inks to the traditional CMYK set increases the attainable colour gamut, but the added complexity creates several challenges in generating suitable <b>colour</b> <b>separations</b> for rendering <b>colour</b> images. In this project, the n-colour separation is achieved by the use of additional sectors for intermediate inks. Each sector contains four inks with the achromatic ink (black) common to all sectors. This allows the extension of the principles of the CMYK printing process to these additional sectors. The methods developed in this study can be generalised to any number of inks. The project explores various aspects of the n-colour printing process including the forward characterisation methods, gamut prediction of the n-colour process and the inverse characterisation to calculate the n-colour separation for target spot colours. The scope of the study covers different printing technologies including lithographic offset, flexographic, thermal sublimation and inkjet printing. A new method is proposed to characterise the printing devices. This method, the spot colour overprint (SCOP) model, was evaluated for the n-colour printing process with different printing technologies. In addition, a set of real-world spot colours were converted to n-colour separations and printed with the 7 -colour printing process to evaluate against the original spot colours. The results show that the proposed methods can be effectively used to replace the spot coloured inks with the n-colour printing process. This can save significant material, time and costs in the packaging industry...|$|R

The proposed methodology is determined by some tested principles, as follows: 1. No Tonal Change. Until its isolation, the colour-object maintains its former tonalities. 2. Unique transform. The pixels that {{do not belong to}} the objects under consideration are “sent ” to the background (value 255, in the 3 components). 3. Colour Spatial Correlation. The decision of considering a non-object pixel depends only on its “cut value ” in a component. A cut value divides the RGB colour cube in two separate volumes or Sections. 4. Spatial Integration. Different Sections combine to form Regions, as intersections of Sections, for the noise-object and Co-Regions, as unions of Sections, for the isolation of the colour-objects. 1. 1 1...|$|R
