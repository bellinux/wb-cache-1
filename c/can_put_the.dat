5|$|Combat in Mother 3 {{includes}} a unique musical combo system {{not seen in}} previous Mother games. When one of the player's characters directly attacks an enemy with a weapon, they can repeatedly attack the enemy by pressing the button {{in time with the}} beat of the background music, with each enemy possessing a musical theme with different rhythms. Using this system, the player can attack the enemy up to sixteen times in a row. When the correct beat is not apparent, the player <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> enemy to sleep to isolate the beat from the music.|$|E
5|$|The {{firewall}} scans for Internet-enabled {{applications and}} creates access rules {{based on a}} knowledge base maintained by Symantec during installation. In PC Magazine testing, the installation took 24 minutes to complete on a 750MHz Pentium III with 92 Internet-enabled applications. Using the firewall, users can determine whether to accept cookies, Java applets, and ActiveX controls on a global or per-site basis. A new feature, Intrusion Detection with AutoBlock, can detect port scans and block further intrusion attempts. The program provides notifications for intrusion attempts, stating the severity level and providing access to threat details. Alternatively, the firewall <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> computer in stealth, essentially hiding the system. Users can configure the security level, affecting the number of notifications. Testing conducted by PC Magazine using Shields Up and Symantec's Security Check found that the firewall successfully stealthed all ports, hiding the computer from view. A leak test was conducted to see the firewall's ability to detect outbound connections. Each attempt was detected and the suite offered to block the attempts.|$|E

25|$|Brad Evans and Julian Reid criticize {{resilience}} {{discourse and}} its rising popularity in their book, Resilient Life. The authors assert that policies of resilience <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> onus of disaster response on individuals rather than publicly coordinated efforts. Tied {{to the emergence}} of neoliberalism, climate change theory, third-world development, and other discourses, Evans and Reid argue that promoting resilience draws attention away from governmental responsibility and towards localized, laissez-faire responses.|$|E
25|$|There is recent {{evidence}} for hybridisation (the {{process of creating}} intermediate forms called hybrids during interspecific breeding) and introgression between Elimia virginica and Elimia livescens amongst populations brought into contact due {{to the opening of}} the Erie Canal. These two species were formerly completely geographically isolated during glaciation by the Alleghenian Divide: the former was only found in Atlantic Slope drainages, while the latter was only found in Interior Basin drainages. Hybridization and introgression of this kind <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> genetic integrity of a species at severe risk, especially when the population is already small.|$|E

25|$|The {{underwater}} environment {{presents a}} constant hazard of asphyxiation due to drowning. Breathing apparatus used for diving is life-support equipment, and failure can have fatal consequences - {{reliability of the}} equipment {{and the ability of}} the diver to deal with a single point of failure are essential for diver safety. Failure of other items of diving equipment is generally not as immediately threatening, as provided the diver is conscious and breathing, there may be time to deal with the situation, however an uncontrollable gain or loss of buoyancy <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> diver at severe risk of decompression sickness, or of sinking to a depth where nitrogen narcosis or oxygen toxicity may render the diver incapable of managing the situation, which may lead to drowning while breathing gas remains available.|$|E
25|$|A sea kayak's {{primary safety}} device is its paddler. Although some kayakers {{consider}} a well-practised self-righting move {{such as an}} Eskimo roll to be essential in order to safe open-water kayaking, it is the technique of bracing that every well-trained, experienced kayaker practises {{in order to maintain}} an upright position in their kayak. Practice in bracing is often neglected by inexperienced kayakers once they have learned the Eskimo roll. However, the reality is that having to roll really means having to recover from a failed brace. Being in the capsized position in some environments due to missing a brace <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> paddler in danger of colliding with obstacles under the water. Staying upright in surf zones, rocky surf zones (informally known as rock gardens), and rivers is most important and is only accomplished through well-practised and successful bracing.|$|E
25|$|Improvisational Music Therapy (IMT), is {{increasing}} in popularity as a therapeutic technique being applied {{to children with}} ASD. The process of IMT occurs when the client and therapist make up music, {{through the use of}} various instruments, song and movement. The specific needs of each child or client need to be taken into consideration. Some children with ASD find their different environments chaotic and confusing, therefore, IMT sessions require the presence of a certain routine and be predictable in nature, within their interactions and surroundings. Music can provide all of this, it can be very predicable, it is highly repetitious with its melodies and sounds, but easily varied with phrasing, rhythm and dynamics giving it a controlled flexibility. The allowance of parents or caregivers to sessions <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> child at ease and allow for activities to be incorporated into everyday life.|$|E

500|$|When {{writing the}} script, Arndt chose the Volkswagen T2 Microbus {{to use for}} the road trip based on his {{experience}} with the vehicle and its practicality for filming: [...] "I remember thinking, it's a road trip, what vehicle {{are you going to}} put them in? And [...] VW bus just seems logical, just because you have these high ceilings and these clean sight lines where you <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> camera. In the front windshield looking back and seeing everybody." [...] Five VW Microbuses were used for the family car as some were modified for different filming techniques. Three of the vans had engines, and the two without were mounted on trailers. During pre-production, the cinematographer used a basic video camera and set it up at angles inside the van to determine the best locations to shoot from during filming. Many of the problems associated with the van that were included in the plot (a broken clutch, a stuck horn, and a detached door), were based on similar problems that writer Arndt experienced during a childhood trip that involved the same type of vehicle.|$|E

[...] Development for the game began {{in the second quarter of}} 2008, according to lead designer Alan Flores. [...] Two posts made to Metallica's website in June 2008 also referred to the [...] "not so top secret GH thing", and that Guitar Hero players could expect [...] "a pile of 'Tallica songs." [...] Lars Ulrich, when asked about the game during an interview with MTV, stated that [...] "the people at ‘Guitar Hero’ and Activision are rapidly becoming our best new friends in the world. You <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> rest of it together yourself." [...] Ulrich stated that the idea for the Metallica-themed Guitar Hero game came from the influence the original Guitar Hero games had on Ulrich and James Hetfield's children, learning about music and older bands such as Deep Purple and Black Sabbath.|$|E

500|$|The plot of Freelancers single-player {{campaign}} is illustrated with two hours worth of in-game cutscenes. [...] The story is linear in structurethe player {{is unable to}} effect a different storylineand broken down into stages. [...] Cutscenes inform players of background events and the goals in a stage. [...] Most stages have no time limits for their completion, and players <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> main story on hold while taking on missions (jobs) not crucial to it. [...] However, players can only proceed to {{other regions of the}} Sirius sector, where more advanced ships, weaponry, and equipment are obtained, after completing missions that advance the story. Some stages are not introduced until the character has achieved a certain level (based on total worth accumulated), and {{it is not possible to}} gain sufficient levels just through the story itself, so players must spend at least some time on side missions to gain money to advance to the level required for the next stage of the story. This is also necessary as some stages would be too tough with only the money and items collected in the story.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Nowitzki <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> {{ball down}} and drive with {{it from the}} perimeter, like few {{have been able to}} do with his size. NBA.com lauds his {{versatility}} by stating: [...] "The 7–0 forward who at times mans the pivot can strike fear in an opponent when he corrals a rebound and leads the break or prepares to launch a three-point bomb." [...] Charles Barkley says the best way to guard Nowitzki is to [...] "get a cigarette and a blindfold". Later on in his career, Nowitzki also developed an unorthodox post up game, often backing down his opponents from the free throw line or near the middle of the key, opening up the floor for multiple passing angles should a double team come his way. [...] When defenses guard Nowitzki with one of their biggest men, who is then pulled out to the perimeter, the net effect is that while Nowitzki's own statistics are actually compromised by being out of position to offensively rebound or make an easy close-range basket, the rest of the team becomes more offensively potent with the defense having to be spread across the floor. Often, this creates mismatches that his teammates can exploit. The Mavericks system and international play exposed him to an open passing game, making him dangerous as a point forward and post playmaker as well.|$|E
