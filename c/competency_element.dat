40|$|The {{impact of}} the quality of {{adjustment}} opportunities and processes given to employees and managers prior to undertaking overseas assignments has been an important focus in the international human resource management literature in recent years. In particular, Parker and McEvoys’ proposed multi-dimensional inter-cultural adjustment model posits the notion that one set of variables at the individual level revolve around the acquisition of relevant managerial skills as antecedents to successful adjustment and consequently, effective individual managerial performance during an overseas assignment. A similar proposition is offered by Black, Mendenhall and Oddou in their expatriate adjustment model. Through recent discursive, conceptual and empirical analysis, the authors have developed a managerial competency (skill) framework that could assist in defining more clearly the relevant managerial skills relevant to successful adjustment. In particular, several exploratory factor analyses performed on perceptual data from a large set of managers from Germany, the US and Australia revealed a 6 factor solution derived from 91 managerial <b>competency</b> <b>elements.</b> The 91 <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> were developed from an extensive review of the literature on this topic. This 6 factor framework has subsequently been evaluated and confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis procedures. Findings indicate that the <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> and factors are generic in nature, although different emphases are placed on some of them in particular cultural settings. The generic managerial competency framework is presented, together with details on the discrimination of <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> in particular cultural settings. Collectively, it is suggested that this framework {{could be used as a}} basis for clarifying existing intercultural adjustment models and processes, by more specifically defining the <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> underpinning managerial performance at the international level...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The need {{to build}} {{research}} capacity within allied health professions has previously been acknowledged as a workforce development strategy required to enhance {{the effectiveness of the}} health system. This study aimed to assess consensus among Australian allied health academics about the research- and evaluation-specific competencies required of graduates in the Australian workforce context. METHODS: A two-round Delphi study was conducted among a purposively sampled panel of 57 allied health educators from physiotherapy, speech pathology, and dietetics from universities across Australia. Panelists were asked to rate a list of extant research and evaluation <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> as essential, useful, or not essential for allied health graduates. RESULTS: Over 30 of the final 69 <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> were considered essential across the three allied health disciplines. There was limited evidence of significant differences in the proportion of panelists across disciplines rating <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> as essential, suggesting good interdisciplinary agreement. CONCLUSIONS: The process of assessing consensus on competency expectations against extant health professional competencies suggests opportunities for more efficient interprofessional research and evaluation competency development in the allied health professions. Further, this challenges the logic of keeping allied health students in disciplinary silos in areas where competencies are shared across education programs...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed to}} investigate the core <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> and the factors affecting the performance efficiency of the civil service teachers in the northeastern region, Thailand. The research procedure consisted of two steps. In the first step, {{the data were collected}} using a questionnaire with the reliability (Cronbach's Alpha) of. 90. The sample size was specified based on Krejcie and Morgan’s table and 352 samples were selected using the simple random sampling technique. The second step involved an in-depth interview of 10 specialists to gain the ways to develop effective performance competency and the statistics used for data analysis included percentage, standard deviation, and descriptive analysis. The questionnaire results revealed that there were 11 elements of 4 core competencies. There were 2 elements for the achievement motivation <b>competency,</b> 3 <b>elements</b> for the service mind <b>competency,</b> 3 <b>elements</b> for the team work <b>competency,</b> and 3 <b>elements</b> for the self-development competency. For appropriate ways to develop core competencies for effective performance of civil service teachers, there were 13 ways which included understanding of related environment, supporting of working resources, having effective management system, reducing losses at work, creating good working atmosphere, promoting participation in decision making, supporting staff for professional development, communicating openly within the organizations, listening to the opinions of others, developing of quality system in work, creating good human relations among staff, building morale in the workplace, and specifying appropriate working patterns. </span...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between three education measures and reported job proficiency amongst civilian contract managers within the Department of Defense (DoD). Congress created a framework for workforce development through the Defense Acquisition Workforce Improvement Act (DAWIA) of 1990. The DoD 2 ̆ 7 s framework established criteria for entry into the contract management workforce. This criteria mandated baccalaureate degree attainment, contract training, and contracting experience within three progressive levels of professional certification for DoD contract managers. The DoD also conducted a 2008 competency study to determine what skills were important in contract management. The study collected Likert Scale survey responses from 9, 504 civilian contract managers and their supervisors. ^ This study used data from the 2008 DoD competency study to test the relationship between the DAWIA criteria and reported proficiency scores in 62 contract management <b>competency</b> <b>elements.</b> Using factor analysis, the <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> were reduced to five competency factors {{from the perspective of the}} contract managers and four competency factors from the perspective of their supervisors. Human capital theory suggests that progressive educational attainment and repeated task performance improve job proficiency; accordingly, the conceptual framework of this study links the three key education measures drawn from the DAWIA criteria - (1) college program of study by degree attainment level, (2) years of contracting experience, and (3) certification level - to reported proficiency scores against competencies identified in the competency model. This study controlled for race, sex, and the area of specialization, e. g., major weapons systems, construction, base operations support, that characterized the contract managers 2 ̆ 7 present assignments at the time of the 2008 study. ...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} into site managerial effectiveness {{in the construction}} industry has been primarily results orientated - based on factual evidence relating to project completion within prescribed parameters of time, cost and quality. These are factors often influenced by circumstances not within the control of the construction site manager. Thus, a need for a nonresults- based effectiveness measurement tool has been identified. Additionally, beliefs exist with{{in the construction industry}} regarding personal attributes of managers which are thought to influence their effectiveness. There is a need to identify the personal factors which do actually influence effectiveness as distinct from those which are falsely believed to have influence. This research has developed such a non-results-based effectiveness measurement tool. Subordinates, peers and superiors of 46 current construction site managers, and a control group of 15 failed site managers, evaluated their site manager over 52 <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> summated to establish an overall effectiveness score.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} behavioural and managerial competency profiles of Project Managers (PMs) and project success in a holistic approach. The Competing Values Model (CVM) and ICB conceptualization (IPMA Competence Baseline, Version 3. 0) served as the ground for the operationalisation of managerial and behavioural competencies, respectively. In this way, fifteen critical behavioural <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> were taken into account (leadership, engagement & motivation, self-control, assertiveness, relaxation, openness, creativity, results orientation, efficiency, consultation, negotiation, conflict and crisis, reliability, values appreciation, ethics). CVM is constituted from two dimensions (Flexibility versus Stability, Internal versus External Focus), defining four quadrants (Open Systems, Human Relations, Internal Processes, Rational Model) that address distinct demands in the organizational arena. Regarding leadership, CVM has also been utilized as a device for mapping Project Managers’ leadership profiles and conducting comparative analysis. The field research {{was based on a}} sample of 97 Project Managers. The crucial behavioural, managerial and emotional competency areas as well as the leadership styles contributing most to project success have been detected.

40|$|Purpose: One {{of the key}} {{elements}} contributing to successful post-disaster project teams is individual competence. Each project participant brings {{his or her own}} knowledge, experience and ideas to the collective. The kind of chaotic and fragmented environment that is common in post-disaster scenarios presents specific barriers to the success of projects, which can be mitigated by ensuring that staff members possess competencies appropriate for their deployment to particular contexts. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The study utilizes a mixed-methods approach, incorporating unstructured interviews to extract key factors of competence, project barriers and strategy, and a subsequent questionnaire survey, designed to quantify the various elements. Interviews were undertaken and analysed using a cognitive mapping procedure, while survey data were processed using SPSS. The data were then utilized {{in the development of a}} software prototype using Design Science Research methodology, capable of modelling the deployment of staff under various disaster scenarios. Findings: Analysis of the survey and cognitive mapping data, in conjunction with relevant established frameworks, has allowed the classification of relevant <b>competency</b> <b>elements.</b> These elements have subsequently been measured and modelled into the competency-based tool and developed into a working prototype. Originality/value: The developed system offers novel disaster competency assessment criteria. The system contains a variety of real-life scenarios derived from extensive data collection. These multi-hazard scenarios are embedded with knowledge and competency valuation criteria that can facilitate actors to assess their team's knowledge based on selective scenarios. In disaster response, time is a critical element, and this tool assists decision makers. It can enable disaster response actors to evaluate and assemble the appropriate personnel to deploy into disaster areas and into specific types of disaster environment...|$|R

Methods: A multiple-method approach including in-depth interviews and the Delphi and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used. Eighteen interviews were undertaken to explore the components of ORN competencies, and then 30 operating room experts were consulted to gain consensus. Finally, the AHP was adopted to determine the relative weights of <b>competency</b> <b>elements,</b> thus increasing the accuracy of the results. Results: Results of the interviews suggested that there were 32 items of ORN core competency. Results of the DHP (Delphi and AHP) revealed 22 ORN core competencies in four dimensions, such as specialized knowledge, professional ability, personality and self-motivation. The weights of these four dimensions were 0. 477, 0. 138, 0. 256, and 0. 128, respectively. Conclusions: The construction of an ORN core competency evaluation index system in this study contained not only explicit competence but also implicit competence, which reflected the requirements for operating room nurses comprehensively in China. In particular, as the system presented the specialized features of an operating room, it would be of great importance for both nurses and hospitals...|$|R
40|$|The Construction {{industry}} has been dealing with much trouble due to global economic recession and domestic political trends emphasizing on welfare than development. Consequently, domestic construction market has been dramatically shrunk during the last a few years, and international market has become the only potential solution for the industry. However, there has been lack of efforts in developing a quantified measure of global competencies for Korean engineering and construction organizations. This study attempted to develop quantified indices for Korean engineering and construction contractors with which the level of global construction competencies can be objectively monitored. In doing so, a survey questionnaire was developed to identify relative importances of core <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> which were derived from extensive literature reviews and experts interviews.

We describe a novel electronic advisor system using {{natural language processing}} (NLP) to identify two geriatric medicine competencies from medical student clinical notes in the electronic medical record: advance directives (AD) and altered mental status (AMS). Materials and methodsClinical notes from third year medical students were processed using a general-purpose NLP system to identify biomedical concepts and their section context. The system analyzed these notes for relevance to AD or AMS and generated custom email alerts to students with embedded supplemental learning material customized to their notes. Recall and precision of the two advisors were evaluated by physician review. Students were given pre and post multiple choice question tests broadly covering geriatrics. ResultsOf 102 students approached, 66 students consented and enrolled. The system sent 393 email alerts to 54 students (82 %), including 270 for AD and 123 for AMS. Precision was 100 % for AD and 93 % for AMS. Recall was 69 % for AD and 100 % for AMS. Students mentioned ADs for 43 patients, with all mentions occurring after first having received an AD reminder. Students accessed educational links 34 times from the 393 email alerts. There {{was no difference in}} pre (mean 62 %) and post (mean 60 %) test scores. ConclusionsThe system effectively identified two educational opportunities using NLP applied to clinical notes and demonstrated a small change in student behavior.

On-the-job learning and mentoring have been proposed as strategies for practice improvement in public health nutrition; however, there is limited evidence for their effectiveness. Methods: An evaluation of a mentoring circle workforce development intervention was undertaken. Thirty-two novice public health nutritionists participated in one of three mentoring circles for 2 h, every 6 weeks, over a 7 -month period. Pre- and post-intervention qualitative (questionnaire, interview, mentor diary) and quantitative (competence, time working in public health nutrition) data were collected. Results: The novice public health nutritionists explained the intervention facilitated sharing of ideas and strategies and promoted reflective practice. They articulated the important attributes of the mentor in the intervention as having experience in and a passion for public health, facilitating a trusting relationship and providing effective feedback. Participants reported a gain in competency and had an overall mean increase in self-reported competence of 15 % (range 3 – 48 % change; P < 0. 05) across a broad range of <b>competency</b> <b>elements.</b> Many participants described re-orienting their practice towards population prevention, with quantifiable increases in work time allocated to preventive workpost-intervention.

This {{study was designed to}} develop a comprehensive framework of competency standards for ophthalmic technicians and optometrists, in Mozambique. This could then inform the evolution of socially responsive curricula for both cadres. Methods A modified Delphi technique was used with a ten member expert panel consisting of optometrists, ophthalmic technicians and ophthalmologists, all with experience of working in a developing country context. The competencies were derived from literature, primary research data and observations from a competency development workshop. The first round involved scoring the relevance of two frameworks, one for each cadre, using a 9 -point Likert scale with a free-text option to modify any competency or suggest additional competencies. The revised frameworks were subjected to a second round of scoring and free-text comment. The final versions of the frameworks agreed were sent out to the relevant stakeholders. Results There was a 100 % response to round 1 and an 89 % response to round 2. The final versions of the competency frameworks contained six <b>competencies,</b> 20 <b>elements</b> and 88 performance criteria for optometry, and six <b>competencies,</b> 17 <b>elements</b> and 61 performance criteria for ophthalmic technicians.

Based on research into the current project management literature, this thesis concludes that three elements - a competent project manager, right project definition and right project organization are the key factors that determine the project success. This study focuses on the first of these three factors: selection of a competent project manager. The research process uses a web formed questionnaire based on the 102 Project Management Institute <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> designed to measure Project Manager Knowledge, Performance and Personal competency. This questionnaire was used to gather data concerning real-world experience of critical project management skills from 16 people who have professional project experiences. Based on this data, a new project management tool was developed to highlight effective project manager selection considerations and effective organizational use of project management analysis and problem solving processes. This new tool attempts to assist the combination of project manager capabilities and organizational capabilities to achieve more effective project success. As a pilot survey, 16 respondents who have project experiences using a project-management approach were invited to complete the study project management questionnaire. The responses concerning the importance of the various elements named in the questionnaire were analyzed. The analysis resulted in a profile representing the critical skills associated with project management from the view of the expert respondents. This thesis proposes this profile as a project manager selection method. It also analyzes organizational project management problems in light of the selection model proposed as a way of helping the project manager, project, and organization move toward more sustainable development. As a part of future research, the effectiveness of this tool in distinguishing between effective and less effective project managers will form the basis of potential future research...|$|R

40|$|Global {{competition}} and specialisation {{have resulted in}} an innovation trend called ‘open innovation’, in which companies develop new products, services or markets collaboratively, by using each others’ know-how, technology, licenses, brands or market channels. A complex form of open innovation is pooled R&D or co-development in strategic partnerships, i. e., open innovation teams. These partnerships embody mutual working relationships between two or more parties aimed at creating and delivering a new product, technology or service. Although inter-organizational collaboration has often {{proved to be a}} prerequisite for successful innovation processes, not each external collaboration results in a success story. It appears that the diversity of organizational backgrounds in open innovation teams can be a source of creativity, but also a source of social and communicative dilemmas resulting in conflicts and project failures. Success factors for (open) innovation projects have been investigated extensively, but most studies undervalue and under-investigate the human side. Therefore, the research presented in this PhD dissertation focussed on individual competence in open innovation teams. The concept of competence is used to describe the range of skills and personal qualities people need for a certain job or task. Competence consists of competencies: integrated capabilities, consisting of knowledge, skills and attitudes, which are necessarily conditional for task performance, and for being able to function effectively in a certain job or situation. The main research question guiding this research was: Which competencies do professionals in an open innovation team need in order to contribute to a successful co-development? A rationalistic multimethod-oriented approach was adopted to tackle the main research question. In line with this approach, five sub-questions were formulated, which addressed (1) the activities that need to be performed in open innovation teams, (2) <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> needed to perform these activities (3) an optimal clustering of the <b>competencies</b> and <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> in a competence profile (4) context variation of the resulting competence profile and (5) the link between open innovation competence and team performance. Multiple sources of evidence were gathered to answer the questions, combining qualitative, quantitative, objective and self-reported data to identify and assess competence. Three studies were conducted: an inter-disciplinary literature study, a qualitative study and a quantitative study. The literature study consisted of an extensive literature review combining literature on learning, (inter-) organizational learning, (open) innovation management, business alliances and networks in organizational, management, Human Resource (HR) and educational studies. The qualitative study consisted of explorative interviews and focus group discussions, which adopted the critical incidents technique and took place with professionals and experts from different organizations and intermediaries who had been working in or with open innovation teams (N= 37). The quantitative study consisted of a cross-sectional online survey and group interviews with professionals from 15 open innovation teams from mainly prospector companies (N= 73). The results showed that there are three main activities to perform in open innovation teams: managing the overall innovation process, managing the collaborative knowledge creation process (consisting of the four stages externalizing and sharing, interpreting and analysing, negotiating and revising, combining and creating), and dealing with the challenges caused by inter-organizational collaboration (consisting of being a good partner, but preventing free-riding; balancing openness and closure and building trust in a non-trusting environment; balancing individual and alliances interests, creating common meanings, goals and work plans; finding a balance between exerting influence and having no influence; fostering optimal dynamics; finding a balance between being in control and having no control; efficiently and effectively organizing teamwork; mobilizing commitment; balancing short- and long-term goals, stability and risk). The first two studies identified various <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> to perform these activities, which were confirmed by the third study. Factor analysis on the data showed that the most optimal clustering of the <b>competency</b> <b>elements</b> resulted in thirteen competencies, which were: being able to ‘involve’, ‘influence’, ‘handle conflicts’, ‘create learning climate’, ‘take on’, ‘prevail’, ‘monitor’, ‘decide mindfully’, ‘communicate clearly’, ‘analyse’, ‘explore’, ‘combine’ and ‘compete’. Multiple regression analysis and one-way ANOVA on the data showed that the competencies ‘take on’, ‘prevail’ and ‘communicate clearly’ were perceived as more important in more complex forms of alliances types. Moreover, it appeared that professionals in charge of project management perceived the competencies ‘involve’, ‘influence’, ‘prevail’, ‘create learning climate’ and ‘monitor’ as more important for their role in the project, compared to professionals in charge of product development or process control. Another finding was that participants perceived the competencies as more important when the team had a good team climate, apart from competencies that dealt with competitive behaviour. However, although slight differences were found across different contexts, the competencies were generally perceived as being important; the competence profile can thus be said to be generic, at least within the research population. Multiple regression analysis on the data showed that the competencies significantly contributed to the success of general innovation processes and specific creation processes and were even stronger predictors of team performance than (some of the) environmental factors. More specifically, the reported application of the competency ‘monitor’ was significantly positively related to the success of general innovation and specific creation processes and the application of ‘compete’ was significantly negatively related to the success of general innovation processes. This study not only found a link between competence and team performance, but also found that the competencies explained much variance in the data. These outcomes suggest that for open innovation professionals in general the application of the competency ‘monitor’ will enhance open innovation team performance. The competency not only entails communicating well enough to do one’s job effectively, but also making results visible and trusting others. The findings contribute to the fields of (open) innovation management and HR in several ways. First, the collaborative knowledge creation model developed adds to the literature by clearly visualizing how knowledge is created at individual and group level, and how the participation and acquisition metaphor and different views on knowledge can be combined into one collaborative knowledge creation model. Second, the outcomes add to HR literature by eliciting information on real problems and challenges, which may occur in complex collaborative knowledge creation processes but were largely overlooked until now. Third, the developed open innovation competence profile adds a new perspective to studies on (open) innovation management that undervalued the human factor in collaborative knowledge creation and innovation processes. Fourth, the results contribute to the fields of (open) innovation and HR, by being one of the first studies that empirically reveals a link between individual competence and team performance controlled for factors at higher aggregation levels. Fifth, the most crucial competency that came out of this study, ‘monitor’, sheds another light on the concept of transparency and trust in inter-organizational alliances. It suggests that the knowledge that needs to be shared specifically concerns the results of one’s own work and that of the team, and sufficient communication to do one’s own work efficiently and effectively. Sixth, the findings confirm earlier suggestions that open innovation teams need strong leadership or a ‘heavyweight’ manager, and the importance of a good team climate in open innovation teams, by revealing a link between team climate and perceived importance of desired competencies. Seventh, the facts that the model contains opposing behaviours and a lack of strong differences across contexts confirm the theory of behavioural complexity. This implies that effective open innovation professionals are those who have, apart from the competencies mentioned in the profile, the capacity to recognize and react to paradox and complexity in their working environment. Finally, the open innovation competence profile covers a broad area of competencies applicable across contexts and describes certain specific behaviours in detail. This result contributes to competency modelling literature by showing that the rationalistic multimethod-oriented approach, results in a profile that contains both information specific to a certain context {{and at the same time}} is applicable across contexts. Future research should focus on comparing open innovation teams, closed innovation teams and other collaboration forms in organizations to reveal areas in which the competence profile can best be applied and the distinctiveness of open innovation competence. Moreover, further research should investigate the robustness of the open innovation competence profile in different situations and the impact of any specific situation in enhancing the use of open innovation competence. Finally, further research should investigate whether HR professionals should support open innovation competence and if so how they should do it. The developed competence profile is highly relevant to practice, since it can be used as a selection, diagnosis, and (self-) evaluation tool in open innovation teams. Organizations are advised to explore the possibility of involving HR professionals in open innovation processes...|$|R

Based on the data of BPJS in late of 2015 also mentions a number of work accidents has 105 182 cases of the victims died as many as 2. 375 people. It is being the trigger of environmental awareness and occupational health and safety from the public, researchers, environmentalists, and government which was made international and national agreements to balance economic growth, social and environmental. The era of globalization and free market World Trade Organization (WTO) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which will take effect in 2020, aspects of the environment, safety and health is part of the terms of the economic relations of trade in goods and services between countries which must be met by all member of the countries, including Indonesia. That condition also reflects the readiness of the competitiveness of Indonesia in the global is still very low. Occupational environmental, health and safety can be implemented in the management system (EHSMS). XYZ Group Company has implemented an occupational environmental health and safety management system based on ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. The audit results show that the last three years operational control element is being the highest finding, the elements allegedly influenced by human resources (HR) competencies.

Changed public demand for information and digital origin of its organization and processing in modern scientific libraries forms a unique, atypical and constantly changing workflow. Librarians must be even more flexible in performance of every day’s tasks. Constantly changing environment forces organizations to plan and anticipate changes to avoid surprises and failures. There is {{a focus on the}} emerging digital society ant its spread in all areas of every day’s life in the scientific literature. Libraries are no exception. New technologies, digital and virtual space challenged librarians to develop competencies atypical for traditional libraries. Modern libraries, regardless of type, constantly forced to adopt their activities and contributions to public needs, and {{this is especially true in}} scientific libraries. They first confronts changes of the information environment that affect the scientific community, institutions and users’ needs and expectations. Modern scientific libraries are non-profit organizations actively involved in the development of technology and knowledge infrastructure, it is analysed how librarians are able to adapt to changing environment. This paper examines what kind of competencies library staff should develop to ensure the successful implementation of changes in modern academic libraries. The first part of thesis deals with the scientific literature on organizational changes and its interaction with competencies. There is overview of changes on public domain and effects on services in recent decades in information environment what related to libraries in this paper section. The second part identifies the occurrence and continuous changes that are taking place in scientific libraries and relates changes to competence. The result of study and analysis is theoretical model that describes how changes and competences interact in academic library. The third section describes the methodology of the model study, which conducted in Lithuanian libraries. The fourth part is an overview, analysis and discussion of the survey results. The findings here are what all competencies groups are necessary for successful change implementation but eliminated some elements.
