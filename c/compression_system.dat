25|$|A {{combustor}} is {{a component}} or {{area of a}} gas turbine, ramjet, or scramjet engine where combustion takes place. It {{is also known as}} a burner, combustion chamber or flame holder. In a gas turbine engine, the combustor or combustion chamber is fed high pressure air by the <b>compression</b> <b>system.</b> The combustor then heats this air at constant pressure. After heating, air passes from the combustor through the nozzle guide vanes to the turbine. In the case of a ramjet or scramjet engines, the air is directly fed to the nozzle.|$|E
25|$|This initial {{version of}} the CF6 has a {{single-stage}} fan with one core booster stage, driven by a 5-stage LP (low pressure) turbine, turbocharging a 16-stage HP (high pressure) axial compressor driven by a 2-stage HP turbine; the combustor is annular; separate exhaust nozzles are used for the fan and core airflows. The 86.4-in (2.19-m) diameter fan generates an airflow of 1,300lb/s (590kg/s), resulting in a relatively high bypass ratio of 5.72. The overall pressure ratio of the <b>compression</b> <b>system</b> is 24.3. At maximum take-off power, the engine develops a static thrust of 41,500lb (185.05kN).|$|E
40|$|Cache {{and memory}} <b>compression</b> <b>systems</b> have been {{developed}} for improving memory system performance of high-performance parallel computers. Cache <b>compression</b> <b>systems</b> can reduce onchip cache miss rate and off-chip memory traffic by storing and transferring cache lines in compressed form, while memory <b>compression</b> <b>systems</b> can expand main memory capacity by storing memory pages in compressed form. However, these systems have not been quantitatively evaluated on an identical condition, making it difficult to understand the performance of a new system relative to the existing systems. In this paper, we provide an identical execution-driven simulation environment for these systems. To the best of our knowledge, none has been evaluated the performance of cache and memory <b>compression</b> <b>systems</b> by using an execution-driven simulator. Experimental results show that cache <b>compression</b> <b>systems</b> reduce cache miss rate by 16 % and memory traffic by 30 %, while it expands memory capacity by less than 160 %. The results also show that memory <b>compression</b> <b>systems</b> significantly expand memory capacity by over 270 %. Based on these experimental analyses, we finally provide future research directions on the <b>compression</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

25|$|Because of {{problems}} with the methanol system earlier in the day, methane clathrate (a flammable ice) had started to accumulate in the gas <b>compression</b> <b>system</b> pipework, causing a blockage. Due to this blockage, condensate (natural gas liquids NGL) Pump B stopped {{and could not be}} restarted. As the entire power supply of the offshore construction work depended on this pump, the manager had only a few minutes to bring the pump back online, otherwise the power supply would fail completely. A search was made through the documents to determine whether Condensate Pump A could be started.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The theory behind <b>compression</b> <b>systems</b> is well established, {{and it is}} {{a common}} {{assumption}} that image <b>compression</b> <b>systems</b> such as DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) perform better in a decorrelated space than with the highly correlated RGB (Red, Green, Blue) components. YUV is therefore the main choice for <b>compression</b> <b>systems</b> instead of the original RGB domain. As a result, several questions arise: (1) Is a DCT-based compression algorithm optimal in a color space with ts? (2) Is inter-color correlation the only criterion for the performan paper we present a new approach to system performance and find a u results than the standard YUV at the same compression rate...|$|R

2500|$|Through {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, new {{standard}} high-speed modes were {{introduced by the}} CCITT. The first of these, v.32, offered 9600bit/s in both directions at the same time, whereas earlier high-speed protocols were high-speed in one direction only. In 1988 Hayes effectively abandoned their Express 96 protocol in favor of v.32, which along with MNP support was built into the $1199 [...] USD Hayes V-series Smartmodem 9600. In 1990 the company introduced the Smartmodem Ultra 96 which offered both v.32 and Express 96 support, and added the new v.42bis error correction and <b>compression</b> <b>system</b> (in addition to MNP). v.32 modems remained fairly rare and expensive, although by 1990 third-party v.32 modems were available for approximately 600 USD.|$|E

The Marlborough—sister ship to the Dunedin – was immediately converted and joined the trade the following year, along with the rival New Zealand Shipping Company vessel Mataurua, while the German Steamer Marsala began carrying frozen New Zealand lamb in December 1882. Within five years, 172 shipments of frozen meat were sent from New Zealand to the United Kingdom, of which only 9 had significant amounts of meat condemned. Refrigerated shipping also led to a broader meat and dairy boom in Australasia and South America.

This paper presents an overview {{and evaluation of}} some compression algorithms suitable for remote sensing applications. Prediction-based <b>compression</b> <b>systems,</b> such as DPCM and JPEG-LS, and transform-based <b>compression</b> <b>systems,</b> such as CCSDS-IDC and JPEG-XR, were tested over twenty multispectral (5 -band) images from CCD optical sensor of the CBERS- 2 B satellite. Performance evaluation of these algorithms was conducted using both quantitative rate-distortion measurements and subjective image quality analysis. The PSNR, MSSIM, and compression ratio results plotted in charts and the SSIM maps are used for comparison of quantitative performance. Broadly speaking, the lossless JPEG-LS outperforms other lossless compression schemes, and, for lossy compression, JPEG-XR can provide lower bit rate and better tradeoff between compression ratio and image quality.
