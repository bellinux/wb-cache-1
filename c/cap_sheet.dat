The underlying magnetic field, which shares the potential alpha with j, is assumed to be dipolar, making the model applicable chiefly to region 2 Birkeland currents.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{method to}} simulate natural exposure of roofing materials {{has been reported}} in a companion article. In the current article, we describe the results of an international, nine-participant interlaboratory study (ILS) conducted in accordance with ASTM Standard E 691 - 09 to establish the precision and reproducibility of this protocol. The accelerated soiling and weathering method was applied four times by each laboratory to replicate coupons of 12 products representing a wide variety of roofing categories (single-ply membrane, factory-applied coating (on metal), bare metal, field-applied coating, asphalt shingle, modified-bitumen <b>cap</b> <b>sheet,</b> clay tile, and concrete tile). Participants reported initial and laboratory-aged values of solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Measured solar reflectances were consistent within and across eight of the nine participating laboratories. Measured thermal emittances reported by six participants exhibited comparable consistency. For solar reflectance, the accelerated aging method is both repeatable and reproducible within an acceptable range of standard deviations: the repeatability standard deviation s r ranged from 0. 008 to 0. 015 (relative standard deviation of 1. 2 - 2. 1 %) and the reproducibility standard deviation s R ranged from 0. 022 to 0. 036 (relative standard deviation of 3. 2 - 5. 8 %). The ILS confirmed that the accelerated aging method can be reproduced by multiple independent laboratories with acceptable precision. This study supports the adoption of the accelerated aging practice to speed the evaluation and performance rating of new cool roofing materials...|$|E

40|$|Platinum group metals are {{the choice}} {{catalysts}} {{for a wide}} variety of catalytic reactions, including oxygen reduction. The focus of this study is to explore the dimensional aspect of both electronic and structure-driven surface properties of Pt monolayers grown via templating on Au. Surface limited redox replacement is used to provide precise layer-by-layer growth of Pt to synthesize well-controlled ‘core-shell’ catalyst architectures. The interaction between core and shell manifests itself through both a structural contribution of epitaxial strain and d-electron orbital mixing. The cumulative effect of the secondary support on the surface Pt and its interaction with adsorbate species is referred to as a ligand effect. The main goal of the research is to investigate how these ligand effects contribute to the structural and electronic properties of Pt monolayer catalysts. One focus of this study is to explore the incorporation of single layer graphene into the core-shell catalyst architecture. Fully wetted 4 - 5 monolayer Pt films can be grown on graphene, maximizing the exposed catalyst surface with high Pt activity and stability. The research also looks to investigate the use of single-layer graphene as an intimate <b>capping</b> <b>sheet</b> to prevent surface dissolution of electrode metals into the electrolyte, without adversely affecting activity.

40|$|Highly {{reflective}} roofs can {{decrease the}} energy required for building air conditioning, help mitigate the urban heat island effect, and slow global warming. However, these benefits are diminished by soiling and weathering processes that reduce the solar reflectance of most roofing materials. Soiling {{results from the}} deposition of atmospheric particulate matter {{and the growth of}} microorganisms, each of which absorb sunlight. Weathering of materials occurs with exposure to water, sunlight, and high temperatures. This study developed an accelerated aging method that incorporates features of soiling and weathering. The method sprays a calibrated aqueous soiling mixture of dust minerals, black carbon, humic acid, and salts onto preconditioned coupons of roofing materials, then subjects the soiled coupons to cycles of ultraviolet radiation, heat and water in a commercial weatherometer. Three soiling mixtures were optimized to reproduce the site-specific solar spectralreflectance features of roofing products exposed for 3 years in a hot and humid climate (Miami, Florida); a hot and dry climate (Phoenix, Arizona); and a polluted atmosphere in a temperate climate (Cleveland, Ohio). A fourth mixture was designed to reproduce the three-site average values of solar reflectance and thermal emittance attained after 3 years of natural exposure, which the Cool Roof Rating Council (CRRC) uses to rate roofing products sold in the US. This accelerated aging method was applied to 25 products?single ply membranes, factory and field applied coatings, tiles, modified bitumen <b>cap</b> <b>sheets,</b> and asphalt shingles?and reproduced in 3 days the CRRC's 3 -year aged values of solar reflectance.

Consequently significantly higher electrical activation of approximately= 84 % and mobility as high as approximately= 3000 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 have been achieved for shallow implantations (30 keV) which are among the best values reported so far with a proximity cap for the InP system.
