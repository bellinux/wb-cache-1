The two middle axles are rigidly attached to the A-Trailer and support the fifth wheel coupling with which the rear trailer is towed. The A-Trailer wheels electronically <b>counter</b> <b>steer</b> with respect to the tractor unit.|$|E

She is too lean in the harping, and too {{full in the}} <b>counter,</b> to <b>steer.</b> Then, she in as wall-sided as a church, and stows too much above the water-line. Besides this, she carries no head-sail, but all the press upon her will be aft, which will jam her into the wind, and, more than likely, throw her aback. The day will come when that ship will go down stern foremost." ...|$|R
5000|$|Drifting Doughnuts - After {{the annual}} lesson {{on how to}} do [...] "drifting doughnuts" [...] is taught, the task must be {{repeated}} inside a confined space in a Ford Mustang GT (with dye in the rear tires to produce red smoke). Shirley tries to finish after slowly driving in a circle, before spinning out of control repeatedly. In one attempt, she is so fixated by the boxes {{on the outside of the}} course (rather than on the road in trying to find the exit), she drives into them and does not stop until after the car is well into the fields. She never manages to do the doughnut. Afiya, described as the best in lessons, often <b>counter</b> <b>steers</b> too early; and in her run, she fails to do the doughnut. Aaron has a tendency to hit the central marker (a maple leaf) due to target fixation, and he too does not manage to do the doughnut. Sly, the self-proclaimed master of doughnuts, manages to repeatedly drive in circles. This prompts Cam Woolley to suggest that Sly [...] "is a lock" [...] for the final three. Like Aaron, he manages to spin the car out, and repeatedly hits the central marker.|$|R
