5|$|<b>Christie</b> (Gary Dourdan), an adept mercenary, is second-in-command of the Betty. After Call is apprehended and {{the crew}} rounded up for execution, <b>Christie</b> uses his hidden pair of pistols to shoot {{them out of their}} situation. When the crew goes underwater, <b>Christie</b> {{harnesses}} Vriess to his back and swims to the opening (which puts them {{in the middle of a}} clutch of Alien eggs). Fleeing from the attacking Aliens, <b>Christie</b> is injured and his foot is snagged by an Alien. He saves Vriess by detaching himself, allowing <b>Christie</b> to fall into the water below, sacrificing himself.|$|E
5|$|<b>Christie</b> was {{promoted}} to rear admiral {{as part of his}} move back to Newport. In January 1943, however, Rear Admiral Robert English, Commander, Submarines, U.S. Pacific Fleet, was killed in a plane crash. <b>Christie</b> hoped to get the position but the job went to Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, commander of submarine operations in Fremantle, and the Bureau of Personnel selected <b>Christie</b> to take over Lockwood's old command. <b>Christie</b> lobbied Vice Admiral Arthur 'Chips' Carpender, Douglas MacArthur's Commander Allied Naval Forces, to allow him to replace Fife as commander of the larger submarine force at Brisbane. Carpender refused, and <b>Christie</b> went on to Fremantle. Nevertheless, <b>Christie</b> continued to try for some time to take the Brisbane force under his control.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Waters married Lady Carolyne <b>Christie,</b> the niece of the 3rd Marquess of Zetland.

50|$|<b>Christie's</b> was {{a public}} company, listed on the London Stock Exchange from 1973 to 1999. In 1974, Jo Floyd was {{appointed}} chairman of <b>Christie's.</b> He {{served as chairman of}} <b>Christie's</b> International plc. from 1976 to 1988, until handing over to Lord Carrington, and later was a non-executive {{member of the board of}} directors until 1992. The auction house's subsidiary <b>Christie's</b> International Inc. held its first sale in the United States in 1977, 13 years later than Sotheby's. <b>Christie's</b> growth was slow but steady since 1989, when it had 42 percent of the auction market.|$|R

5|$|The funeral {{scene at}} the end of the film was also played {{differently}} from what was originally intended. Julie <b>Christie</b> was supposed to wear a veil to hide away her face, but prior to filming Roeg suggested to <b>Christie</b> that she should play it without the veil and smile throughout the scene. <b>Christie</b> was initially sceptical, but Roeg felt it would not make sense for the character to be heartbroken if she believed her husband and daughter were together in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|After Christie's {{return from}} his second combat patrol, Admiral Chester Nimitz {{recommended}} he and Lockwood meet in Brisbane and discuss joint submarine operations. During the visit, Lockwood and <b>Christie</b> discussed technical issues, {{as well as}} the establishment of advanced bases in Mios Woendi and Saipan. However, the meeting also resulted in some kind of personal rift between the two men. They had already clashed over the Mark 6 exploder and the Mark 14 torpedo, and some of Lockwood's staff believed Christie's ride in Harder was a risky and unnecessary stunt. After meeting with Lockwood, <b>Christie</b> met with MacArthur and related the events of Dealey's fifth war patrol to the general. MacArthur then decided to award Dealey a Distinguished Service Cross, and <b>Christie</b> the Silver Star. Additionally at this meeting, <b>Christie</b> found out his earlier recommendation for an army decoration to Griffith had apparently been blocked by Kinkaid. Despite Kinkaid's order regarding army decorations, MacArthur insisted on granting medals to the two men. Although <b>Christie</b> did not request the decorations, he was put on the spot and felt compelled to report the entire affair to Kinkaid. In the end, the general awarded the medals, displeasing Kinkaid.|$|E
5|$|After the war, <b>Christie</b> {{attempted}} to get command {{of operations for}} Atlantic submarines, but that job went to James Fife instead. However, <b>Christie</b> was given command of naval forces in the Philippines. He retired from the Navy on 1 August 1949, with tombstone promotion {{to the rank of}} vice admiral. He sold life insurance and dabbled in other ventures for some time. In his final years, he lived on the west coast of the United States and in Hawaii. <b>Christie</b> died in Honolulu, Hawaii on 19 December 1987 at the age of 94. His wife, LaRene, joined him at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific following her death on 31 May 2002. His papers are in the Library of Congress.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{as soon as}} the war began, {{submarine}} captains indicated {{there were}} problems with the Mark 14 torpedo and the influence feature of the Mark 6 exploder. Torpedoes would fail to explode, or explode prematurely. Despite these reports, <b>Christie</b> was not fully aware {{of the impact of the}} situation, because his S-boats used the older Mark 10 torpedo, with a contact-only pistol. <b>Christie</b> acknowledged Mark 14s were running deeper than set, but attributed the failures to poor maintenance and errors on the part of the captain and crew. He was convinced the Mark 6 was satisfactory, and ordered all fleet boats to continue to use it. In November 1942, <b>Christie</b> was ordered to return to Newport as Inspector of Ordnance at the Torpedo Station. Newport had become a bottleneck for torpedo manufacture, and the Bureau of Ordnance wanted to advance development of the Mark 18 electric torpedo. <b>Christie</b> resisted leaving his command at Brisbane, but was considered of more use to resolve the torpedo issue. He was replaced by Captain James Fife. For his service at Brisbane, <b>Christie</b> was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E
5|$|<b>Christie</b> {{returned}} to the United States, {{and went on to}} command Puget Sound Navy Yard. Now that he was no longer under Kinkaid's command, <b>Christie</b> renewed his push to get Dealey awarded the Medal of Honor, this time by getting the endorsement for the decoration from MacArthur. The general agreed, and Dealey was posthumously awarded the medal.|$|E

5|$|In 1939, <b>Christie</b> {{was given}} command of Submarine Division 15, {{consisting}} of all six Salmon-class submarines. By 1941, Germany and the United Kingdom {{were engaged in}} the Battle of the Atlantic. Although the United States was neutral, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the U.S. Atlantic Fleet to enforce the Neutrality Patrol to assist UK-bound convoys. As part of secret agreements with Britain, the United States agreed to provide the former with submarines under Royal Navy control, should America enter the conflict. Admiral Richard S. Edwards, Commander, Submarines, Atlantic Fleet (ComSubLant), selected the now Captain <b>Christie</b> as tactical commander for the proposed submarine force in British waters. <b>Christie</b> wanted the new Tambor-class submarines to be assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, but was overruled by Admiral Harold R. Stark, who selected the older S and Barracuda classes instead. As war seemed increasingly likely {{toward the end of}} 1941, <b>Christie</b> placed his boats on full war footing.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} for <b>Christie</b> to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations {{to the crew}} on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by Ultra, the reading of coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like <b>Christie,</b> he {{took it upon himself}} to authorize the decorations rather than to go through the standard review procedures. These events compelled Kinkaid to forbid <b>Christie</b> to give pierside awards, and to keep <b>Christie</b> from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. These events would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E
