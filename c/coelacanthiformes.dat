50|$|Because it {{is clear}} that the jaws and skull of Styloichthys share many derived {{features}} with <b>coelacanthiformes</b> it is placed as the oldest coelacanth.|$|E
50|$|Hadronectoridae is an extinct {{family of}} prehistoric {{coelacanth}} fishes which lived during the Carboniferous period. However, according to Actinistia, it could include Laugiidae, Rhabdodermatidae and not extinct <b>Coelacanthiformes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Actinistia is a {{subclass}} {{of mostly}} fossil lobe-finned fishes. This subclass contains the coelacanths (Order <b>Coelacanthiformes),</b> including the two living coelacanths, {{both of the}} genus Latimeria: the West Indian Ocean coelacanth and {{the king of the}} sea.|$|E
50|$|More distantly related {{ortholog}} {{sequences of}} C3orf62 include organisms from classes Reptilia, Sarcopterygii, and Actinopterygii ranging from an E-value of 8e-10 to 3e-59 with similarity of 24-39%. Organisms in this grouping consist of Testudines, <b>Coelacanthiformes,</b> Squamata, and Osteoglossiformes orders.No ortholog sequences of C3orf62 {{were found for}} the following life forms: Bacteria, archaea, protist, plant, fungus, trichoplax, invertebrate, amphibian, or bird.|$|E
50|$|Coelacanthus ("Hollow Spine") is a genus of extinct {{coelacanths}} {{that first}} {{appeared during the}} Permian period. In fact, {{this was the first}} genus of coelacanths ever described, as the order <b>Coelacanthiformes</b> is named after it. They bear a superficial similarity to the living Latimeria, though they were smaller, and had more elongated heads. Individuals grew up to 3 feet in length, and had small lobed fins, suggesting that Coelacanthus were open-water predators.|$|E
50|$|The average species {{turnover}} time, {{meaning the}} time between when a species first is established and when it finally disappears, varies widely among phyla, but averages about 2-3 million years. So a living taxon that had long been thought to be extinct could be called a Lazarus taxon once it was discovered to be still extant. A dramatic example was the order <b>Coelacanthiformes,</b> of which the genus, Latimeria {{was found to be}} extant in 1938. About that there is little debate. However, whether Latimeria resembles early members of its lineage sufficiently closely to be considered a living fossil as well as a Lazarus taxon, has been denied by some authors in recent years.|$|E
40|$|Published data on initial chamber (protoconch) {{diameter}} in 507 species, and embryonic shell (ammonitella) diameter in 231 {{species of}} Ammonoidea, and embryonic shell (nauta) diameters for 132 species of coiled Nautiloidea, {{were used to}} examine evolutionary change in ectocochleate cephalopod reproductive strategies. Palaeotemperatures {{were found to be}} a key factor influencing historical changes in the evolution of egg size in ammonoids and nautiloids. A negative relationship was found between egg size and warming of the Earth’s climate. Factors related to habitat were also important; in general egg size was larger in cold-water cephalopods. Egg size in Lytoceratina and Phylloceratina in the deep waters of the upper continental slope was much larger than in epipelagic Scaphitidae, as in modern fish and squids. Small eggs and high evolutionary rates helped ammonoids to colonise new habitats and develop high biological diversity, but involved them in planktonic food webs making them more vulnerable to abiotic variability (e. g., climatic changes), ultimately leading to their extinction. Large eggs helped nautiloids to persist through geological history, but at the cost of lower biological diversity, lower evolutionary rates and restricted options for colonising new habitats. Large-egged species such as nautiloids are more vulnerable to ecological, biotic disasters such as the appearance of new predators, including modern fishery. Independence from the planktonic food web is likely to be very important for a taxon’s long-term survival over evolutionary history, as demonstrated also by <b>Coelacanthiformes</b> and Elasmobranchia...|$|E
40|$|The order <b>Coelacanthiformes,</b> {{once thought}} extinct, is much studied mainly because it {{contains}} species that share characteristics with lungfishes and tetrapods. Only {{a few years ago}} living specimens were discovered to science, and observations are so rare that the species are considered to be critically endangered. Observations include Latimeria chalumnae in deep waters of the coast of south eastern Africa while Latimeria menadoensis is known from similar habitats in Indonesian waters. Because of the interest around these enigmatic species, Ecological Niche Modelling techniques have been applied to estimate their distribution. The underlying assumption is that the environmental characteristics of the observation points are representative for the species. In this article we evaluate the difference in the output between the niche distributions produced by two expert systems and by two models based on Artificial Neural Networks. We evaluate the predictive behaviour of such models by focusing on L. chalumnae, as more observations are available for this species with respect to L. menadoensis. Finally, we assess the reliability of the maps by numerically evaluating the representativeness of the environmental characteristics in the observation locations, with respect to an area where the models show significant differences. This approach is different from previous ones because one of the expert systems is used to infer pseudo-absence points, that are successively employed to feed a Neural Network. One of the models based on this Neural Network is used to estimate the potential distribution and to produce a more extended map. The method promises to be applicable to other species with few observations, and allows to exploit the power of presence&# 8726;absence based techniques...|$|E
