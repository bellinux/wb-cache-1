Poorly designed work schedules have been linked with mental and physical fatigue of the machine operators, low productivity and low value recovery for some operations.

40|$|The {{harvesting}} {{and use of}} in-forest residues as bioenergy is {{not common}} in New Zealand. However, most of the large wood-processing plants (pulpmills, papermills, and sawmills) have co-generation plants for converting woody residues from wood processing (bark, shavings, and sawdust) into process steam and electricity. In a number of New Zealand's major areas of forestry, changes in harvesting practices have recently taken place, from conventional landing-based stem-to-log processing {{to the use of}} two-stage extraction with full stems being taken to <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>yards</b> or super skids for conversion into logs. These changes have brought about a concentration of stem-to-log processing waste at the <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> sites. This waste is of such a volume as to create a disposal problem (cost). Use of this material as bioenergy fuels at nearby processing plants, or as panel fibre, is economically and environmentally desirable...|$|R
40|$|Possibilities {{for energy}} wood {{procurement}} in the Leningrad region are assessed in this report. As sources for energy production, wood from thinnings, logging residues, non-industrial round wood and residues from sawmilling are considered. The costs for energy wood procurement are also calculated. Available energy wood, {{based on the}} 2004 actual cut, if collected, is approximately 4 million m 3. Nearly 86 % of it is non-industrial round wood and felling residues in cutting areas (56 %) and <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>yards</b> (30 %), the rest (14 %) are by-products from sawmilling. The deciduous tree species (birch and aspen) dominate and are valued at 65 % of {{the total amount of}} felling residiues and non-industrial wood. It is possible to intensify utilisation of forest resources and thereby also to increase the use of wood in energy production. The total amount could be 54 % higher if the allowable cut could be utilised completely and 124 % higher if thinnings could also be utilised completely. There are, however, big differences within the region, as the current rate of utilisation of forest resources varies in the region. Currently, pre-commercial thinning is an economically unfeasible source of energy wood. Despite well developed technologies, the high costs of the pre-commercial thinning make supply of energy wood unprofitable. Commercial thinnings are economically more attractive as sources of energy wood. However, a choice of energy wood procurement chain for the 1 st commercial thinning is limited by cost factors. There are more possibilities for energy wood supply from the 2 nd commercial thinning. The most cost-efficient supply chain based on a harvester and a forwarder allows a profitable energy wood supply from a distance of up to 150 km. Currently, at final felling areas non-industrial wood is an economically feasible resource for energy production. The same applies to the availability of process residues at <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>yards</b> and sawmills, where lump wood and slabs are the most cost-efficient resources for wood chip production and at present these sources of energy wood look very attractive. The issue of how much energy wood may enter the market depends almost entirely on the market situation, i. e. supply and demand, which is influenced by the price of energy wood and competing energy sources...|$|R
40|$|The energy wood {{procurement}} {{possibilities for}} the eight regions making up Northwest Russia were assessed. Wood byproducts from roundwood harvesting and sawmilling were considered for energy production based on actual harvesting, sawmill and plywood production figures for 2006. Of the total calculated potential of 31 million solid m 3 (62 TWh), nearly 70 % (21. 8 million m 3) is from harvesting. The remainder (9 million m 3) is from saw and plywood milling. The approximate available energy wood by region would be: 2. 3 million m 3 from the Republic of Karelia, 2. 7 million m 3 from the Republic of Komi, 5. 4 million m 3 from Arkhangelsk, 4. 6 million m 3 from Vologda, 3. 8 million m 3 from Leningrad, 2. 0 million m 3 from Novgorod, 0. 8 million m 3 from Pskov, and 41, 000 m 3 from the Murmansk regions. There are large differences in the potentials between and within the regions. This {{is due to the}} differences in their forest resources; differences in their utilisation of these resources; the available intrastructures; some limitations on wood harvesting. A part of this calculated potential is already utilised, since some non-industrial roundwood from <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>yards</b> sawmills and plywood mills are currently used in energy production. Nearly 65 % of all the potential energy wood from roundwood harvesting is non-industrial roundwood, 19 % is spruce stumps removed after final felling, 8 % is unused branches and tops, and 8 % is defective wood resulting from logging. About 58 % of the total potential energy wood from roundwood harvesting is coniferous. However, there are large differences between the regions and within the regions in the species proportions. Currently about 40 % of the allowable cut is used. This means that {{it would be possible to}} intensify the utilisation of the forest resources and thereby also to increase the use of wood for energy production. Full implementation of the allowable cut could provide 73. 5 million m 3 of energy wood (147 TWh). In addition, if the technical potential for thinnings was utilised, the total potential energy wood provided by roundwood harvesting, saw and plywood milling could be 104 million m 3 (208 Twh) ...|$|R
30|$|A database, {{containing}} over 120, 000 {{records on}} Pinus radiata D.Don (radiata pine) stems processed during 214 work shifts, was analysed {{in order to}} determine the impact of time of day on value recovery and productivity of log-handling equipment that consisted of a scanning optimiser and two mechanised processors operating in an off-forest <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>yard</b> in New Zealand.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Over {{the next}} quarter century {{there will be}} about an eight-fold {{increase}} in the volume of wood harvested annually from New Zealand's steep terrain radiata pine plantations. With the move to steeper terrain {{it is expected that}} there will be a trend towards considerably smaller landings. With smaller landings final log manufacture could have to take place at alternative locations to the large landings normally used. The locations examined in this thesis were: at the stump, at a landing, and at a <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>yard.</b> Comparisons were made on the basis of value recovery, harvesting productivity and costs, and land taken out of production by landings. A field trial indicated that value recovery at the landing was better than at the stump but the magnitude of difference was dependent on individual log manufacturers. Better value recovery on the landing was generally due to more logs meeting specification and more accurate length measurements. Radiata pine stems are too long to be hauled to a <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>yard</b> without some initial cuts being made at the stump. Initial cuts preempt future log manufacturing decisions. An analysis of fixed long length patterns indicated that about 5 ? of possible value would be foregone by these preemptive cuts. To analyse the effect of alternative log manufacturing locations on harvesting productivity and costs a stump-to-milldoor simulation model was constructed. Tree-length logging to large landings was the most productive and least costly alternative, the stump was the second best alternative, and the <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>yard</b> was the most expensive and least preferred alternative. In an overall economic analysis it was concluded that where possible large landings and yarders should continue to be used. Where it is not possible to use large landings, final log manufacturing should be carried out at the stump, provided log manufacturers have handheld computers to assist them in decision making so that value recovery is kept as high as possible...|$|E

30|$|Traditionally, initial {{assessment}} of logs in New Zealand has occurred at landing {{areas in the}} forest close to felling operations. Another approach used intermittently in New Zealand for over forty years has been to transport logs to a <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>yard</b> (CPY), sometimes called a log-sort yard. Purported advantages of centralised processing include the provision of many wood-marketing and value-capturing services via concentrating, merchandising, processing, and sorting of logs (Dramm et al. [2004]). Additional advantages may include savings in road construction and transportation costs, reduced logging and landing construction costs, reduced environmental impacts resulting from smaller landings, improved utilisation of logging residues, and greater opportunities resulting from artificial lighting to work longer hours in a yard than in a forest (McKerchar & Twaddle [1987]).|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanized}} <b>central</b> <b>processing</b> <b>yard</b> for merchandizing tree length {{material into}} logs {{provides the opportunity}} for higher levels of mechanization {{as well as the}} potential to increase value recovery. Located {{in the middle of a}} large contiguous plantation forest area in the central North Island of New Zealand, the Kaingaroa Processing Plant (KPP) processes over 1 million tonnes of Radiata Pine per year into 70 to 80 different log sorts. The plant is run 24 hours per day, 6 days per week. The stems enter the plant and are scanned for size and shape. Four crews work in 12 hours shifts to control grading and value recovery from the stems. To manage and optimize the process, a comprehensive data collection procedure captures all important data. This database was analyzed to determine the effect of time of day, as well as day of shift on both productivity and value recovery. This paper provides an overview of the KPP operation, discusses shift work implications and presents results from the shift analyses. Example results include a slight but significant increase in productivity in the night time shift compared to daytime, as well a slight but significant decline in value recovery with time into shift...|$|E
