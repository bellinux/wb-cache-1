40|$|Most of {{the early}} {{research}} in inventory theory concentrates purely on demand uncertainty. However, models which aim to capture the dynamics of real-world systems must also take uncertainties in the supply side into consideration. One type of supply uncertainty that has attracted considerable attention {{during the past decade}} is supply disruptions, such as those that arise as a result of <b>customs</b> <b>delays,</b> labor strikes, and natural disasters. Over the past several years, companies have developed many strategies to mitigate the effects of such disruptions. One strategy is to hold more inventory with the additional amount serving as a buffer against disruptions.

This chapter summarizes the studies on EOQ models with supply disruptions...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} {{on the relationship between}} economic diversification and development has grown rapidly in recent years, partly due to the surprising finding that diversification rises with gross domestic product per capita up to a certain point. Export diversification along the extensive margin is inextricable from the introduction of new export products. The authors test the hypothesis that the threat of imitation inhibits the introduction of new exports [...] export discoveries [...] under the assumption that the intensive and extensive margins of exports are correlated within broad country-industry groups. Econometric evidence from panel-data techniques that are appropriate for count data (the number of discoveries) suggests that discoveries within countries and industries rise with the growth of exports along the intensive margin (relative to the growth of non-export gross domestic product) but the magnitude of this partial correlation increases with domestic barriers to entry and with <b>customs</b> <b>delays</b> in exporting. However, the magnification effect of barriers to entry appears to be less significant as a determinant of total within-country export discoveries. This is consistent with inter-industry and within-country spillovers related to export discoveries, implying that barriers to entry enhance the effect of export growth on discoveries within country-industries but total discoveries might be unaffected by barriers to entry.

40|$|Abstract Background: Consumer {{interest}} {{and demand for}} healthy and ecologically produced local food {{has led to a}} high market demand that local production cannot meet. Product attributes of perishability and short life cycles ensure that even local supply chains are challenging to manage. This increases potential for risks occurrence in an Organic Food Supply Chain (OFSC) especially with unreliable supply of products. Small and established food retailers import organic food products from across the world. <b>Custom</b> <b>delays,</b> high transport charges, commodity costs and regulatory requirements are associated with food imports. This renders OFSCs complex and vulnerable to disruptions or breakdowns that require appropriate strategies to identify and mitigate risks. Purpose: To gain an overall insight of risks mitigation in OFSCs. The purpose of this thesis is to assess risks affecting suppliers and retailers of organic food and propose risk mitigation strategies to prevent or minimise supply chain breakdowns. Method: This qualitative study utilizes a case study strategy involving seven case firms and seven research respondents. Data is collected through semi-structured interviews and documentary secondary data. The analysis of the empirical findings is conducted by cross analysing empirical findings of respective case firms and then emerging patterns are formulated into a general framework. Conclusions: Low conversion rates of farms for organic production, high costs of investments and regulatory requirements have contributed to prevailing production risks that partly cause low organic output. Other risks identified that could disrupt the food chain under study include sourcing, warehousing, demand, price, financial and institutional risks. Mitigation strategies proposed include production procedures, CAP, supply chain flexibility, supply chain visibility, certification, diversification of retail channels, brand image building, horizontal & vertical cooperation and buyer-supplier relations...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to clarify some {{important}} links between regional co-operation, (soft) infrastructure and trading costs, and to suggest some hypotheses for further investigation. Khan and Weiss(2006) discuss the issue of both hard and soft infrastructure in this context. This paper is a continuation of Khan and Weiss(2006) but in the specific context of soft infrastructure, and particularly governance, including corporate governance. As Khan and Weiss(2006) point out, conceptually such discussions can be seen as a part of the analysis of the 'New Regionalism' The key idea here is co-operation through preferential trade and investment agreements that aim to strengthen structural economic reform, aid economic transformation, attract foreign investment and generally raise the international competitiveness of participating countries. This paper identifies several crucial areas of future research with potentially large value added. The general hypothesis with significant policy implications which can be elaborated and tested is that trade costs are negatively related to the existence of and improvements in soft infrastructure. A related hypothesis is that cross-border cooperation in building and maintaining both hard and soft infrastructure synergistically will lead to a reduction in trade costs. More specifically it will be useful to know the how high are the barriers to trade created by factors like high freight costs, slow port handling, <b>customs</b> <b>delays,</b> lack of competition in the insurance sector, poor corporate governance, unofficial payments and so forth. Some of these factors may be intrinsically difficult to quantify but the potential pay-off from policy-relevant research of this type is enormous. Optimal policies for regional cooperation in soft infrastructure will be difficult if not impossible to formulate in the absence of this type of research. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} resource {{barriers that}} firms experience influence their capability to export. This in turn influences the export {{performance of the}} country {{and the extent to which}} exports contribute to economic growth. The aim of this paper is to analyse the impact of resource barriers, more specifically firm size, productivity, firm-specific capital and labour market constraints, on South African firms' decision to internationalise. The literature on South African exporting firms presents some interesting glimpses of the exporting behaviour of firms in South Africa. However, these were cross-sectional studies focusing on earlier NES data and the 2003 ICA data. This paper tries to provide another dimension in terms of data, by taking the 2007 ICA data into account and by constructing a unique panel from the World Bank Enterprise Survey data for 2003 and 2007. Using panel data allows for better understanding of South African firms in that it enables one to consider the dynamic nature of firms over time. Also, the earlier South African contributions examined the export behaviour of South African firms, but did not control for unobserved heterogeneity. This paper takes the analysis a step further by estimating a panel data two-step Heckman selection model of the predictors of firms’ export propensities and intensities. From the overall results of the model, it is clear that the unobserved factors that make export more likely tend to be associated with lower levels of exports. The main findings are that firm size, productivity and finance matter for exports. Also, barriers to doing business, such as electricity, <b>customs</b> <b>delays</b> and transportation and the use of imported inputs influence exporting firms’ supply-side capabilities. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{measures}} {{the impact of}} investment climate factors on the total factor productivity (TFP) of firms in China and Brazil. The analysis is conducted in two steps: first, an econometric production function is estimated to produce a measure of TFP at the firm level; in the second step, variation in TFP across firms is statistically related to indicators of the investment climate as well as firm characteristics. The result yields a number of insights on the factors that underlie productivity. In both countries and {{in a variety of}} industry groups, indicators of poor investment climate, especially <b>customs</b> clearance <b>delays</b> and utility services interruptions, have significant negative effects on total factor productivity. Reducing customs clearance time by one day in China could increase TFP by 2 - 6 %. Indicators such as email usage have positive effects on TFP. In the case of China, state-owned firms and firms located in the interior are shown to be much less productive than privately owned firms and firms located in the East. In Brazil, the results present an interesting contrast between the apparel industry and the electronics industry.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} three topics {{relevant}} to humanitarian applications: (i) stable and complete assignment of staff members to field offices, (ii) bottleneck management for transportation networks, and (iii) performance {{measurement of the}} food assistance supply chain. The assignment and reassignment of personnel to jobs is a large-scale problem faced by many organizations including the military and multi-national organizations. Although successful algorithms have been developed that can ensure matchings that are stable (without incentive to deviate), not all practical concerns have been addressed by these algorithms. For example, the gap we study is that when staff members do not provide preference lists covering all jobs, a complete stable matching is not guaranteed. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we model negotiations, which occur in practice, as part of the problem of matching all agents. We introduce algorithms and structural results for when the organization negotiates with specific agents to modify their preference lists and the centralized objective is to minimize the number or cost of negotiations required to achieve complete stable matchings. An uncertain environment with disruptions is a reality faced by many humanitarian operations but not fully addressed in the literature. Transportation delays are often driven by reliability issues (e. g., <b>customs</b> <b>delays,</b> strikes, and the availability of transport), and the length of wait time can be influenced by congestion. In the second part of the thesis, we describe a queuing model with breakdowns to model delays in port and transportation corridors (the overland travel from discharge ports to delivery points). Using the model, we gain insights into where delays are most detrimental to system performance (i. e., the network's "bottleneck") in port and transportation corridors. We then include our delay modeling in a convex cost network flow model that determines optimal routing when several port and corridor options are available. Finally, we examine a resource allocation model for where to invest in improvements to minimize delay. Throughout, we compare solutions using the optimal approach to rules of thumb and identify important factors that might be missing in practical decision making currently. Third, we present a case study on the implementation of supply chain key performance indicators (KPIs) at a large humanitarian organization. We describe (i) the phases necessary for a full implementation of supply chain KPIs at a humanitarian or non-profit organization, (ii) how to address strategy, mindset, and organizational barriers, and (iii) how to adapt commercial supply chain KPI frameworks to the humanitarian sector, factoring in implementation constraints present in the humanitarian sector that may impact KPI development.

Higher membrane protein recovery was always obtained from lyophilized midguts compared to frozen midguts, and similar membrane marker enzyme activities were found in BBMV from either treatment. Comparable equilibrium dissociation constants and binding site concentrations, calculated from binding experiments with labeled (125) I-Cry 1 Ab toxin, were found using BBMV from either method.

40|$|Excerpt] NAFTA {{set forth}} a {{schedule}} for implementing its trucking provisions {{that would have}} opened the border states to cross-border trucking competition in 1995 and all of North America in 2000, but full implementation has been stalled because of concern with the safety of Mexican trucks. Congress first addressed these concerns in the FY 2002 Department of Transportation Appropriations Act (P. L. 107 - 87) which set 22 safety-related preconditions for opening the border to long-haul Mexican trucks. In November 2002, the U. S. Department of Transportation announced that all the preconditions had been met and began processing Mexican applications for U. S. long-haul authority. However, a suit over environmental compliance delayed implementation further. After the suit was resolved, in February 2007, the U. S. and Mexican Secretaries of Transportation announced a demonstration project to implement the NAFTA trucking provisions. The purpose {{of the project was}} to demonstrate the ability of Mexico-based motor carriers to operate safely in the United States beyond the border commercial zones. Up to 100 Mexico-domiciled carriers would be allowed to operate throughout the United States for one year and Mexico would allow the same for up to 100 U. S. -based carriers. With passage of the U. S. Troop Readiness, Veteran’s Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007 (P. L. 110 - 28), Congress mandated additional requirements before the project could begin. After failing to defund the demonstration project in the FY 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P. L. 110 - 161), Congress succeeded in terminating the demonstration project through a provision in the FY 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act (P. L. 111 - 8). Subsequently, Mexico announced it would retaliate by increasing import duties on 90 U. S. products. The Obama Administration has indicated it intends to propose a revamped program that will address the concerns of Congress. The FY 2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P. L. 111 - 117) passed in December 2009 did not preclude funds from being spent on a long-haul Mexican truck pilot program, provided the terms and conditions stipulated in section 350 of P. L. 107 - 87 and section 6901 of P. L. 110 - 28 were satisfied. One truck safety statistic, “out-of-service” rates, indicates that Mexican trucks operating in the United States are now safer than they were a decade ago. The data indicate that Mexican trucks and drivers have a comparable safety record to U. S. truckers. Another study indicates that the truck driver is usually the more critical factor in causing accidents than a safety defect with the truck itself. Service characteristics of long-haul trucking suggest that substandard carriers would likely not succeed in this market. As shipment distance increases, the relative cost of trucking compared to rail increases, and thus shippers utilizing long-haul trucking are willing to pay more because they require premium service, such as precise delivery windows or cargo refrigeration. These exacting service requirements would seem to disqualify truckers with unreliable equipment or incompetent drivers. In contrast, the short-haul “drayage” carriers that Mexican long-haul carriers would displace, typically use older equipment because of the many hours spent idling awaiting customs processing at the border. If Mexican carriers do eventually receive long-haul authority, the short term impact is expected to be gradual as Mexican firms deal with a number of stumbling blocks, including lack of prearranged back hauls and higher insurance and capital costs, in addition to the <b>customs</b> processing <b>delays.</b> In the long run, use of drayage companies is likely to decline as they lose part of their market share to Mexican long-haul carriers. The most common trips for these carriers will probably be from the Mexican interior to warehouse facilities on the U. S. side of the border or to nearby cities in the border states...|$|R
