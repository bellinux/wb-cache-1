25|$|Collins, {{the son of}} a <b>cattle</b> <b>dealer,</b> grew up in {{a middle}} class Irish family in Camlough, a small, staunchly Irish republican town in South Armagh. Despite the {{sentiment}} of the area, the Collins family had no association and little interest in Irish Nationalist politics. Collins' mother was devout Catholic, and he was brought up under her influence with a sense of awe for the martyrs of that religion in Irish history, in its conflicts with Protestantism.After completing his schooling, Collins worked for a time in the Ministry of Defence in a clerical capacity in London before studying Law at Queen's University, where he became influenced by Marxist political ideology.|$|E

2500|$|Dulwich, {{named after}} the {{settlement}} in the London Borough of Southwark, has its origins in Section 263 of the Adelaide region as laid out by South Australia's first chief surveyor, Colonel William Light. It was bought by a Captain of the Royal Navy, Daniel Pring.

After several transactions the land was sold; John Hector, manager of the Savings Bank of South Australia bought much of the land {{with the exception of}} that located around Victoria Park. It was Hector who christened the land as the 'Village of Dulwich', or in the colloquial terms of the time, 'Hector's Paddock'. Hector oversaw the subdivision of the land and its transfer to many new owners. The Adelaide press at the time, {{in the form of the}} Advertiser and the South Australian Gazetter, was exceptionally generous in their words relating to the new village: 'The Suburban Village of Dulwich ... beautifully situated on a gentle rise sufficient to command a view of the sea, with the noble amphitheatre of the hills for a background', 'For building sites convenient to the metropolis, Dulwich has no rival'.|$|E

About 1760, a group of Portuguese, led by Domingos José Vieira, left the first nucleus (today, district of Porto) and formed another, in a high place and surrounded by two streams.|$|R
