Biomass is a well-known waste material that has heterogeneous nature. This complicated nature poses a barrier on the competitiveness of biomass in the energy generation market. One of the methods is through the hydrothermal <b>carbonization</b> <b>process.</b> It is also proven through various experiments that the hydrothermal <b>carbonization</b> <b>process</b> {{has the ability to}} convert different type of biomass into higher carbon products. However, the complexity of biomass in nature shows that various chemical and physical characteristics were reported. Therefore, in this study, a comparison between carbon products from woody and non-woody agricultural waste via hydrothermal carbonization was done. Wood chips (WC) were chosen for the woody type of biomass, while for the non-woody, the oil palm empty fruit bunch (EFB) was chosen. The hydrothermal <b>carbonization</b> <b>process</b> occurs in the excess water with the addition of citric acid as the catalyst. The reaction process occurs in a pressure vessel for temperature, 220 °C at different operating time. The chemical (elemental analysis, proximate analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermagravimetric analysis (TGA),) and physical characteristic (field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) andgas pyconometer) ratio) of the carbon products were verified.
