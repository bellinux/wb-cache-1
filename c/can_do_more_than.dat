25|$|Thirdly, covetousness is {{the third}} worldly evil, which {{is also known as}} lust. Colet calls this a plague that has {{overtaken}} many priests and blinded many. Many take part in the Church only for the hope of riches and promotions. Priests forget that they should be interested in the good they <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the amount of riches that they stand to gain. Paul called covetousness the root of all evils. From it, benefices stack up, including pensions and tithes. Colet states that: “every corruption, all the ruin of the Church, all the scandals of the world, come from the covetousness of priests”.|$|E

The Lower lake had existed during the Colquhouns' ownership, but the island within it, and the Upper lake, were Churchill's own creations. On 1 January 1935, while Lady Churchill {{was on a}} cruise off Sumatra, Churchill described the beginnings of his endeavours {{in one of his}} Chartwell Bulletins; [...] "I have arranged to have one of those great mechanical diggers. In one week he <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 40 men can do. There is no difficulty about bringing him in as he is a caterpillar and can walk over the most sloppy fields". Excavation work proved more challenging than Churchill had anticipated, two weeks later he wrote again, [...] "The mechanical digger has arrived. He moves about on his caterpillars only with the greatest difficulty on this wet ground".|$|E

[...] "Well, after all, one might as well die that way as any other," [...] Lody said, according to Steinhauer; [...] "I shall be rendering the Fatherland a service and no other German <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> that." [...] At a final meeting at the Anhalter Bahnhof in Berlin, Steinhauer repeated his warnings, but Lody [...] "only laughed at me and told me my fears were groundless." [...] Steinhauer regarded Lody's ability to carry out his mission as [...] "practically nil" [...] and warned the Chief of Naval Intelligence not to send him to the UK, but the warning went unheeded. He recalled that [...] "as he had specially volunteered for the task– and I must admit there were very few people in Berlin just then anxious to accompany him– they allowed him to go." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception towards Mulan's {{personality}} and characterization have been generally positive. Time Out hailed Mulan as [...] "A feisty young go-getter [...] {{rises above the}} male-dominated world in which she lives." [...] Ken Fox of TV Guide wrote, [...] "Intelligent and fiercely independent, Mulan... runs afoul of social expectations that a woman will be always obedient and duty-bound to her husband." [...] Bridget Byrne of Boxoffice wrote that [...] "Mulan... has pride, charm, spirit and aesthetic appeal which prevents her from being upstaged by the vigorous and exciting action in which she participates." [...] Varietys Todd McCarthy praised the character for inspiring [...] "a turn of the circle from such age-old Disney classics... in which passive heroines were rescued by blandly noble princes." [...] McCarthy continued, [...] "Here, it's the girl who does the rescuing, saving not only the prince but the emperor himself from oblivion, and this in a distant culture where women were expected to obey strictly prescribed rules." [...] Similarly, Margaret A. McGurk of The Cincinnati Inquirer lauded Mulan for [...] "solv her G.I. Jane dilemma by proving that brains <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> brawn." [...] Hailing the character as [...] "Among the strongest heroines in Walt's cartoon canon," [...] Ian Freer of Empire enthused, [...] "Mulan's engaging mixture of vulnerability and derring-do becomes incredibly easy to root for." [...] Hollis Chacona of The Austin Chronicle dubbed Mulan a [...] "winning protagonist." [...] Likewise, the Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "As a vivacious rebel who has {{to be true to}} herself no matter what, Mulan is an excellent heroine, perfect for the young female demographic the studio is most anxious to attract", additionally calling her a [...] "more likable and resourceful role model than Pocahontas".|$|E
500|$|Following {{his injury}} in 1924, Gilligan {{could no longer}} bowl fast and, as a player, had little {{influence}} on the 1924–25 tour of Australia; his performances were hampered by further injuries. His best bowling figures of four for 12 came in the opening match and his only century came in the second game; he passed fifty just once more on the tour. His leadership proved influential in one main respect. In previous series, Australia had been superior to England in the field, but according to Gibson, Gilligan [...] "revolutionized the English fielding, a department in which they began to compare with Australia, {{for the first time}} since the war and possibly since the early 1900s. This had much effect on the England sides of the next few years". However an Australian newspaper estimated that England dropped 21 catches in the five Tests, which may have impacted on the series result; Australia won 4–1. Other aspects of Gilligan's leadership were less successful; his captaincy lacked tactical sophistication, and the Australian captain Herbie Collins proved superior in this respect. According to Gibson, critics claimed that Gilligan [...] "was too easygoing on the finer points of law". In addition, his inexperience led to defeat in one warm-up match that the MCC could have drawn, and commentators dismissed him as naive and easy-going on the field. However, he was immensely popular with the Australian public and well-liked by his team. Gibson, writing in 1979, noted that Gilligan [...] "was, and is, one of the most popular captains England have sent to Australia". During the tour, Gilligan was the focus of a great deal of publicity. The periodical Cricket described him as [...] "'one of the most jovial personalities imaginable", while former Australian Test captain Monty Noble wrote that Gilligan was the [...] "type of man who, in the most unostentatious way, <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> all the politicians and statesmen to cement the relations between the Homeland and the Dominions". His sportsmanship, including his grace and cheerfulness in defeat, made him, according to Noble, a perfect English gentleman and an [...] "Empire builder".|$|E

2500|$|As {{pavement}} systems primarily fail due to fatigue (in {{a manner}} similar to metals), the damage done to pavement increases with the fourth power of the axle load of the vehicles traveling on it. According to the AASHO Road Test, heavily loaded trucks <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 10,000 times the damage done by a normal passenger car. [...] Tax rates for trucks are higher than those for cars in most countries for this reason, though they are not levied in proportion to the damage done. Passenger cars are considered to have little practical effect on a pavement's service life, from a materials fatigue perspective.|$|E
2500|$|Writing in Rolling Stone, Bud Scoppa {{said that}} in {{combining}} their respective strengths, [...] "each [...] has released the other from the conventions in which they both stagnated. On On the Road to Freedom, we discover that Alvin Lee isn't just a slick blues guitarist and purveyor of boogie, and that LeFevre <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> spew out gospel jive." [...] Scoppa highlighted [...] "Fallen Angel", [...] "Carry My Load" [...] and [...] "On the Road to Freedom" [...] as {{the best of the}} songs written by Lee or LeFevre, and similarly praised the Harrison and Wood compositions. In The Rolling Stone Record Guide (1983), John Swenson described the album as [...] "excellent" [...] while Charley Walters admired the expressivity of LeFevre's voice and the variation in Lee's guitar playing, which, he said, eschewed [...] "the showing-off tendencies of Ten Years After". Walters deemed the mix of musical styles to be [...] "Pleasingly pastoral and rustic".|$|E
2500|$|Oak Ridge was {{developed}} by the federal government as a segregated community as a requirement by the Southern bloc of Democrats in Congress to authorize funding for the project. Due to generally holding lower-ranked jobs, their assigned dwellings were predominantly government-built [...] "hutments" [...] (one-room shacks) located very close to the Y-12 plant, in the one residential area designated as colored. [...] Kenneth Nichols, the MED District Engineer, was told by the main construction contractor for the K-25 plant that the Negro construction labor force had a large turnover rate, so Nichols gave permission to set up a separate black women's camp. When Leslie Groves visited the plant with K. T. Keller of Chrysler, Keller saw twelve Negro women sweeping the thirty-foot wide alley between the production units, and said [...] "Nichols, don't you know there is a machine made to sweep a concrete floor like this?" [...] Nichols replied [...] "Sure I do, but these gals <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one of those machines". The men now had an opportunity to [...] "fracas" [...] on Saturday night, and labor turnover had reduced. During the war, plans were made for a colored neighborhood of houses equal in quality to those provided for whites, but it was not implemented due to limited resources. After the war, all hutments were dismantled, and a colored neighborhood of permanent houses {{was developed}} in the Gamble Valley area of Oak Ridge, which during wartime had been occupied by a white trailer community.|$|E
