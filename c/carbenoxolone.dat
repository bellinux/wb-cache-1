50|$|<b>Carbenoxolone</b> (CBX) is a glycyrrhetinic acid {{derivative}} with a steroid-like structure, {{similar to}} substances {{found in the}} root of the licorice plant. <b>Carbenoxolone</b> is used for the treatment of peptic, esophageal and oral ulceration and inflammation. Electrolyte imbalance is a serious side effect of <b>carbenoxolone</b> when used systemically.|$|E
5000|$|A {{synthetic}} analog, <b>carbenoxolone,</b> {{was developed}} in Britain. [...] Both glycyrrhetinic acid and <b>carbenoxolone</b> have a modulatory effect on neural signaling through gap junction channels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbenoxolone</b> {{has also}} been {{investigated}} for nootropic effects. This research started from an observation that long-term exposure to glucocorticoids may have negative effects on cognition. <b>Carbenoxolone</b> may decrease the amount of active glucocortocoid in the brain, because the drug inhibits 11β-HSD, an enzyme which regenerates cortisol, an active glucocorticoid, from inactive cortisone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbenoxolone</b> is a {{modestly}} potent, reasonably effective, water-soluble blocker of gap junctions.|$|E
50|$|In the {{research}} trial investigating {{this use of}} carbenoloxone, it was shown that the drug improved verbal fluency in elderly healthy men (aged 55-75). In type 2 diabetics aged 52-70, the drug improved verbal memory. However, potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride was co-administered with <b>carbenoxolone,</b> since <b>carbenoxolone</b> used by itself may cause hypertension by increasing cortisol in the kidneys.|$|E
50|$|<b>Carbenoxolone</b> {{reversibly}} inhibits {{the conversion}} of cortisol to the inactive metabolite cortisone by blocking 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD). 11β-HSD also reversibly catalyzes {{the conversion of}} 7-ketocholesterol to 7-beta-hydroxycholesterol.|$|E
5000|$|... 11β-HSD1 is {{inhibited}} by <b>carbenoxolone,</b> a drug {{typically used}} {{in the treatment of}} peptic ulcers. Moreover, 18alpha-glycyrrhizic acid from the root of glycyrrhiza glabra was discovered as an inhibitor.|$|E
5000|$|For example, a gastric cytoprotectant is any {{medication}} that combats ulcers not by reducing gastric acid but by increasing mucosal protection. Examples of gastric cytoprotective agents include prostaglandins which protect the stomach mucosa against injury by increasing gastric mucus secretion. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit {{the synthesis of}} prostaglandins and thereby make the stomach more susceptible to injury. [...] Gastric cytoprotective drugs include <b>carbenoxolone,</b> deglycyrrhizinised liquorice, sucralfate (aluminium hydroxide and sulphated sucrose), misoprostol (a prostaglandin analogue) and bismuth chelate (tri-potassium di-citrato bismuthate).|$|E
5000|$|... 11α-Hydroxyprogesterone (11α-OHP), or 11α-hydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione is an {{endogenous}} steroid and metabolite of progesterone. It is a weak antiandrogen, and is {{devoid of}} androgenic, estrogenic, and progestogenic activity. It was investigated as a topical antiandrogen {{for the treatment}} of androgen-dependent skin conditions in the early 1950s, and was found to produce some benefit. In 1995, 11α-OHP, along with its epimer 11β-hydroxyprogesterone, was identified as a very potent competitive inhibitor of both isoforms (1 and 2) of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD). It is notably not metabolized by 11β-HSD2. 11α-OHP is a more potent inhibitor of 11β-HSD than enoxolone (glycyrrhetinic acid) or <b>carbenoxolone</b> in vitro (IC50 = 0.9 nM; IC50 = 5 nM in transfected cells). The compound {{has been found to be}} highly active in conferring mineralocorticoid sodium-retaining activity of corticosterone in vivo in rat bioassays and in increasing blood pressure, effects that it mediates by preventing the 11β-HSD-mediated inactivation of endogenous corticosteroids. Because of its inhibition of 11β-HSD and consequent potentiation of corticosteroids, 11α-OHP has recently been patented {{for the treatment of}} skin diseases, particularly psoriasis in combination with clobetasol propionate and minoxidil.|$|E
40|$|A {{controlled}} {{trial of}} <b>carbenoxolone</b> sodium positioned-release capsules (Duogastrone) {{was carried out}} on a randomized series of 100 unselected male Service personnel with symptoms of active duodenal ulceration and supporting radiological evidence. Fifty-seven patients completed the trial, 29 in the <b>carbenoxolone</b> group and 28 in the control group. The <b>carbenoxolone</b> group was given capsules containing 50 mg <b>carbenoxolone</b> {{four times a day}} for 12 weeks while the controls received a capsule identical in every respect except that it did not contain <b>carbenoxolone.</b> All patients were assessed at fortnightly intervals and had clinical and radiological reassessments three and six months after commencing treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Carbenoxolone,</b> as an antiulcer medicine, {{has some}} {{pharmacological}} properties such as: the inhibition of gap junctional (GJ) intercellular communication. In vitro studies have shown, <b>carbenoxolone</b> {{to abolish the}} generation of full or partial ectopic spike generation, by 4 -aminopyridine, as well as spontaneous epileptiform activity in CA 3 or CA 1 regions of the rat hippocampal slices via closing GJ channels. Thus, we considered the possible anticonvulsant effects of <b>carbenoxolone</b> in animal seizure models. Results ED 50 values of diazepam and <b>carbenoxolone</b> in the pentylenetetrazole model were 1. 13 mg/kg and 283. 3 mg/kg, respectively. In this model, <b>carbenoxolone</b> in doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg prolonged the onset time of seizure and decreased the duration of seizures. In the maximal electroshock model, <b>carbenoxolone</b> in a dose of 400 mg/kg decreased the duration of seizure producing protection against seizure but failing to protect against mortality in comparison with diazepam. In the potentiation of pentobarbitone sleep test, <b>carbenoxolone</b> significantly increased sleeping time and decreased latency in doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg in mice dose dependently. In the traction test, <b>carbenoxolone</b> (400 mg/kg) showed muscle relaxant activity and in the accelerated rotarod test, <b>carbenoxolone</b> in doses of 200 and 300 mg/kg showed a decline in motor coordination. Conclusion It can be concluded that <b>carbenoxolone</b> possesses anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and hypnotic effects, which could contribute to the control of petit mal and grand mal seizures. </p...|$|E

A similar inhibitory effect of <b>carbenoxolone</b> was observed on contractile responses of the isolated rat colon and guinea-pig ileum to electrical field stimulation and acetylcholine. <b>Carbenoxolone</b> could have inhibitory effects on neuromuscular transmission in the isolated rat colon and guinea-pig ileum and seems this effects unrelated to uncoupling effects of it...|$|E
40|$|The {{absorption}} of <b>carbenoxolone</b> sodium {{has been studied}} in 15 patients with gastric ulcer and eight patients with duodenal ulcer treated for four weeks. Blood levels of <b>carbenoxolone</b> showed a log distribution, varied markedly between patients, and were significantly higher after Biogastrone tablets (300 mg/day) than after Duogastrone capsules (200 mg/day). Serum <b>carbenoxolone</b> levels were similar in patients taking Biogastrone tablets before or after meals, and in patients taking Biogastrone tablets or Duogastrone capsules with or without antacids following chronic administration. Serum <b>carbenoxolone</b> levels were similar in patients whose gastric ulcers had or had not healed after four weeks' treatment. Serum <b>carbenoxolone</b> was significantly higher in patients who developed oedema, and was significantly correlated with age and with fall in plasma potassium. <b>Carbenoxolone</b> may exert its metabolic effects systemically, but its ulcer-healing effects topically; additional {{studies are needed to}} test this hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Carbenoxolone</b> is a {{derivative}} of glycyrrhetinic acid, the active principle of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), a medicinal root. The pharmacological properties attributed to <b>carbenoxolone</b> {{are related to}} its inhibitory actions on the 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and gap junction channels. Recent {{studies have shown that}} <b>carbenoxolone</b> also induces swelling and membrane potential collapse in mitochondria. These effects were related to hydrogen peroxide generation and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) induction, indicating possible toxicological actions of <b>carbenoxolone</b> at the mitochondrial level, which could trigger the apoptotic pathway. The data of these previous reports are pointing, thus, {{in the direction of a}} possible action of <b>carbenoxolone</b> on the bioenergetic functions of mitochondria, which could in turn cause toxic metabolic changes in the liver. For this reason, the present work was planned to investigate the action of <b>carbenoxolone</b> on respiratory and ATPase activity of isolated rat liver mitochondria. Male Wistar rats, weighing 180 to 220 g, fed with a standard laboratory diet were utilized. Mitochondrial respiration was measured polarographically. The mitochondrial ATPase activity was measured in intact (coupled and uncoupled) and in freeze-thawing disrupted mitochondria. In isolated mitochondria, <b>carbenoxolone</b> increased state IV respiration and respiration dependent solely on succinate and β-hydroxybutyrate oxidation. However, it decreased state III respiration and diminished the respiratory control ratio. <b>Carbenoxolone</b> stimulated the ATPase activity of intact mitochondria and inhibited the ATPase activity of uncoupled mitochondria. The ATPase activity of freeze-thawing disrupted mitochondria was not altered. <b>Carbenoxolone</b> impairs energy metabolism probably acting as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation...|$|E

40|$|The {{vascular}} {{actions of}} the lipophilic gap junction inhibitors 18 alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid, 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid and the water-soluble hemisuccinate derivative of 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, <b>carbenoxolone,</b> were investigated in constricted rings of rabbit superior mesenteric artery. EDHF-type relaxations to acetylcholine, observed {{in the presence of}} N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and indomethacin, were attenuated by incubation with 18 alpha-giycyrrhetinic acid, 18 beta-glycyrrhctinic acid or <b>carbenoxolone</b> in a concentration-dependent fashion. By contrast, none of these agents affected responses to sodium nitroprusside, an exogenous source of NO, and relaxations evoked by acetylcholine in the absence of L-NAME were attenuated by approximately 20 %. 18 alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid exerted no direct effect on vessel tone, whereas 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid and <b>carbenoxolone</b> caused relaxations. Relaxations to <b>carbenoxolone</b> were attenuated by endothelial denudation and by incubation with L-NAME, whereas those to 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid were unaffected. In conclusion, all three agents inhibit EDHF-type relaxations evoked by acetylcholine. Unlike 18 alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid, <b>carbenoxolone</b> and 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid possess intrinsic relaxing properties which in the case of <b>carbenoxolone</b> involves functional enhancement of NO activity in addition to direct effects on vascular smooth muscl...|$|E
40|$|Comparison by {{equilibrium}} dialysis of {{plasma protein}} binding sites for <b>carbenoxolone</b> in people under 40 {{years of age}} and in people over 65 years of age showed that the number of binding sites was reduced in the elderly and that this fall was associated with a reduction in plasma albumin levels. Although <b>carbenoxolone</b> has some aldosterone-like effects, these properties could not be shown to be due to displacement of aldosterone from its protein binding sites by competitive protein binding of <b>carbenoxolone.</b> Single doses of <b>carbenoxolone</b> were found to be removed considerably more slowly from the plasma of elderly individuals than from the young. The results of these three series of experiments suggest that the side-effects of <b>carbenoxolone</b> in the elderly may in part be caused by reduced protein binding, leaving more free drug in the active unbound form, and in part by reduced hepatic clearance mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The transmucosal {{electrical}} potential difference (pd) and the sodium and potassium net fluxes were measured in the rectum of subjects taking <b>carbenoxolone.</b> There was a rise in transmucosal pd persisting throughout treatment in all subjects which was accompanied {{by an increase in}} sodium absorption and potassium secretion. Comparison of the pd changes produced by <b>carbenoxolone</b> with those due to the mineralocorticoid 9 -alpha-fluorocortisol showed that <b>carbenoxolone</b> had about 1 / 1000 th the potency on a weight basis and the two drugs appeared to be additive in their effects. Topical instillation of <b>carbenoxolone</b> into the rectum produced an elevation of pd which persisted for three days. Amiloride and bendrofluazide did not interfere with these actions of <b>carbenoxolone</b> but spironolactone abolished them.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{side effects}} of the drug <b>carbenoxolone</b> (Biogastrone; 18 beta-glycyrrhetinic acid sodium hemisuccinate) are sodium retention, hypokalemic alkalosis, suppressed plasma renin, and hypertension. In previous animal studies, <b>carbenoxolone</b> appeared not to have intrinsic mineralocorticoid activity but, rather, to enhance aldosterone action by displacing it from nonspecific binding sites. We here report studies showing that <b>carbenoxolone</b> has demonstrable affinity for rat kidney mineralocorticoid receptors, intrinsic mineralocorticoid activity in the adrenalectomized rat at doses consistent with its receptor affinity, and, in addition, a powerful action of amplifying the electrolyte effects of near-maximal doses of aldosterone...|$|E
40|$|Background: Retinal {{ganglion}} cells {{expressing the}} photopigment melanopsin are intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs). These ganglion cell photoreceptors send axons to several central targets {{involved in a}} variety of functions. Within the retina ipRGCs provide excitatory drive to dopaminergic amacrine cells via glutamatergic signals and ipRGCs are coupled to widefield GABAergic amacrine cells via gap junctions. However, the extent to which ipRGCs are coupled to other retinal neurons in the ganglion cell layer via gap junctions is unclear. <b>Carbenoxolone,</b> a widely employed gap junction inhibitor, greatly reduces the number of retinal neurons exhibiting non-rod, non-cone mediated light-evoked Ca 2 + signals suggesting extensive intercellular coupling between ipRGCs and non-ipRGCs in the ganglion cell layer. However, <b>carbenoxolone</b> may directly inhibit light-evoked Ca 2 + signals in ipRGCs independent of gap junction blockade. Methodology/Principal Findings: To test the possibility that <b>carbenoxolone</b> directly inhibits light-evoked Ca 2 + responses in ipRGCs, the light-evoked rise in intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +] i) was examined using fura- 2 imaging in isolated rat ipRGCs maintained in short-term culture in the absence and presence of <b>carbenoxolone.</b> <b>Carbenoxolone</b> at 50 and 100 mM concentrations completely abolished the light-evoked rise in [Ca 2 +]i in isolated ipRGCs. Recovery from <b>carbenoxolone</b> inhibition was variable. Conclusions/Significance: We demonstrate that the light-evoked rise in [Ca 2 +] i in isolated mammalian ganglion cel...|$|E

40|$|Fifty-four outpatients with endoscopically {{diagnosed}} benign {{gastric ulcer}} were allocated at random to treatment with either cimetidine 800 mg daily {{for six weeks}} or <b>carbenoxolone</b> sodium 300 mg daily for one week then 150 mg daily for five weeks. Ulcers were reassessed by endoscopy {{at the end of}} the trial. The endoscopist was unaware of the treatment and did not take part in the clinical care of the patients. Twenty-one of the 27 patients (78 %) given cimetidine and 14 of the 27 (52 %) given <b>carbenoxolone</b> had healed ulcers. Symptomatic response occurred earlier with cimetidine but was not significantly better. Unwanted effects were more common in the <b>carbenoxolone</b> group: 12 patients developed hypokalaemia, four of whom needed oral potassium supplements. The results suggest that histamine H 2 -receptor blockade is at least as effective as <b>carbenoxolone</b> sodium for benign gastric ulcer and produces fewer side effects...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{putative}} gap junction blocker <b>carbenoxolone</b> on smooth muscle syncytial properties and junction potentials were studied in guinea pig vas deferens (GPVD). Treatment with 50 mu M <b>carbenoxolone</b> reversibly and significantly increased input resistance (R-in) (by 682. 5 +/- 326. 0 %, P < 0. 05) and abolished cable potentials within 6 7 mins of incubation, without disturbing resting membrane potential. <b>Carbenoxolone</b> reversibly and significantly increased the amplitude of spontaneous excitatory junction potentials (sEJPs) by 96. 9 +/- 35. 45 % (P < 0. 05), shifted their amplitude distribution rightwards, and reduced their frequency of occurrence by 58. 17 +/- 17. 7 % (P < 0. 05), without altering their time courses. Similarly, <b>carbenoxolone</b> increased the amplitude of evoked excitatory junction potentials (eEJPs) by 17. 7 +/- 5. 88 % and tau(decay) by 19. 43 +/- 8. 29 % (P < 0. 05). Our results indicate that <b>carbenoxolone</b> alters the electrical properties and junctional potentials of the GPVD by a mechanism consistent with a relatively specific block of gap junctions.

40|$|SUMMARY <b>Carbenoxolone</b> (Biogastrone, Berk) {{has been}} shown to reduce the peptic {{activity}} and total acidity of gastric juice obtained from anaesthetized pylorus-ligated rats without affecting significantly the volume of gastric juice secreted or the K+ concentration. Glycyr-rhetinic acid was less potent in reducing peptic activity and caused no reduction in total acidity. Antipeptic activity of <b>carbenoxolone</b> has also been demonstrated in vitro using the pepsin plate technique and the haemoglobin pepsin assay. It is suggested that these actions of <b>carbenoxolone</b> may contribute to the increased rate of healing of peptic ulcer in patients treated with the drug.

In rat hepatic and mesenteric arteries with endothelium, <b>carbenoxolone</b> (100 or 500 [*]μM) depolarized the smooth muscle but did not modify hyperpolarizations induced by KCl or levcromakalim.

The affinity of both compounds for mineralocorticoid receptors in this human model was also compared with that found in kidney cytosol from adrenalectomized rats. Glycyrrhetinic acid possesses a measurable affinity for mineralocorticoid receptors in mononuclear leukocytes, which is 1 : 3, 000 that of aldosterone itself. <b>Carbenoxolone</b> does not bind to the receptors in mononuclear leukocytes, in contrast with kidney cytosol where the drugs show a parallel affinity. The mean intracellular content of sodium in mononuclear leukocytes from 7 volunteers was 35 % higher (p less than 0. 05) after incubation with 3 mumol glycyrrhetinic acid than after incubation with an equivalent amount of <b>carbenoxolone,</b> or in medium alone. The effect of glycyrrhetinic acid was completely reversed by addition of canrenone for the period of incubation. We conclude that the syndrome of pseudohyperaldosteronism from <b>carbenoxolone</b> is thus probably not related to a direct agonist effect of the drug at the level of mineralocorticoid receptors, but that any action must follow in vivo conversion into glycyrrhetinic acid by hydrolysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>carbenoxolone</b> on {{the synthesis of}} glycoproteins in the surface mucous cells {{and the production of}} new cells in the rat gastric mucosa was studied by means of a vascular perfusion system. The rate of incorporation of tritiated galactose, glucosamine, serine, and sulphate in surface mucous cells, studied by autoradiography, was not affected by the addition of <b>carbenoxolone</b> to the drinking water. The sugar composition (determined by gas-liquid chromatography) of the gastric glycoproteins (isolated by centrifugation in CsCl), was not changed in carbenoxolone-treated rats. Compared with untreated animals, the number of [3 H]-thymidine labelled nuclei per fundic pit increased by 38 % to 76 % in carbenoxolone-treated rats, implying a higher number of mitotically active cells. This results in an increased supply of young mucous cells; if this also proves to be true in human gastric mucosa, it may be relevant to the therapeutic effect of <b>carbenoxolone...</b>|$|E
