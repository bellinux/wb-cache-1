30|$|There {{is a close}} {{relationship}} between human activities and <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> in coastline. Human activities are carrying object of coastline, such as fishing, reclamation, port construction, etc. It is increased with economic development. <b>Carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> refers to natural space of coastline capacity for exploitation. It is limited in specific time and region. When the human activities scale out limited <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> the coastline is overload. Otherwise, the coastline is loaded. In Zhejiang province, the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> that the coastline provided shows regional big difference and varies with marine function zonation. And the intensity of human activities increased and varied in 25 sections in the last 50  years. The aim of coastline management is to prevent increased human activities from exceeding the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> We hope to control human activities through remote sensing images monitoring and <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> assessment before it was overloaded. Moreover, we can view <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> as goal states and aim to achieve them through active monitoring and management. Generally, the higher coastline artificialization, the bigger <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> index in limited coastline <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity.</b> In the future, we recommend that this model should {{be applied to the}} practice of coastline management in China.|$|R

The research on <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of marine resource and environment has aroused the attention of scholars in recent years. William et al. <b>carried</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> research in the Marshall Islands based on the theory of island animal geography balance [15]. Some scholars discussed the relationship between ecological <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and sustainable development in island from perspective of social demographic factors [16 – 18]. Jusup and Klanjseek proposed a simulation interaction model between marine biology culture and natural environment in the evaluation of the marine ecological <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of Cape Bolinao in the Philippines [19]. Cao evaluated resource and environment <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of Hainan island in 2003 – 2009 by means of ecological footprint [20]. Some scholars introduced energy analysis into <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of the uninhabited island [21].

30|$|The {{coastline}} is {{not only}} the boundary line between the sea and the land, but also the transition zone from terrestrial ecosystem to marine ecosystem. It has biodiversity conservation, marine disaster protection, tourist leisure and entertainment, and other ecosystem service functions [1]. Most of the industry of iron and steel, petrochemical engineering, and mechanical manufacture transfer to coastline with global economic integrating in recent decades. This drives large-scale exploitation of the coastline with sea area reclamation, port construction, aquaculture, and other human activities. The exploitation changed coastline landscape and destroyed ecosystem service function of the coastline [2]. The conception of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> in ecology comes from population ecology. The earliest <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> is the maximum number of individuals living in a specified condition [3]. Malthus introduced the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> into human ecology and proposed that the resource and environment restrict the growth of population in the end of eighteenth century. Then, he established the basic framework of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> research based on the logistics model of population <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> [4]. Park and Burgess gave the definition of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> from the viewpoint of “capacity” and analyzed the relationship between the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> and the <b>carrying</b> target in 1921 [5]. Hawden and Palmer transferred the expression of <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> from limited capacity to relative balance capacity based on theory of “balance quantity” and “environmental balance” [6]. The study on the <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> of resource and environment was gradually rising from 1930 s; scholars carried a lot of research on land <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> water resource <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> tourist <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> environmental <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity,</b> etc. in agriculture area, typical watershed, wetland, natural reserve and other ecologically fragile areas, and created evaluation methods of net primary productivity estimation, ecological footprint, supply and demand balance, comprehensive index, and system models [7 – 9]. The <b>carrying</b> <b>capacity</b> research has gradually developed from conception, theoretical analysis to practical application and provided policy guidance for solving problems such as population expansion, resource shortage, environmental pollution, and ecological destruction [10 – 13].|$|R
