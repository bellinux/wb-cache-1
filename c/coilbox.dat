50|$|In December of 2001 Alberto (lead vocals) and Dani (drums), {{coming from}} Only For, next to other components, {{they begin to}} look for people to {{initiate}} a new musical project. Spent a time they know Javi (lead guitar) of Holocausto. In February 2002 After to have shuffled several names to put the group, chooses the one of FreakMind like the definitive one.During {{the second week of}} December of 2002 FreakMind they record his first demo in the Cube studies of Madrid with Luis Tarraga (lead guitar of Hamlet) like producer and Alberto Seara (Sober, Savia, Hamlet, Skunk DF, <b>Coilbox)</b> like sound engineer. The songs that are included in this demo are Empty, Liquid Sand and Madness Threads. The Demo of the formation had a very good recognition between specialized means. To part of specialized means detailed later, numerous forums of Internet and pages also specialized have made a good welcome.In the summer of the 2004, and after going and coming from some bass guitars and some reconstruction of the group, Ivan (bass guitar - The Dandelion) gets up the group. FreakMind bets by the studies M-20 (Madrid) and BigSimon (Mago de Oz, Stravaganzza, <b>Coilbox,</b> Terroristars, Skizoo,…) like producer to record and to mix its first CD “Six Degrees of Separation” in April-May 2005.Ivan decides to leave the formation in the Summer of 2006. At the few weeks Ruben (bass guitar) arrives at FreakMind, coming from Osmio."Six Degrees of Separation” is published in March 2007 by Lengua Armada.|$|E
40|$|Using {{finite element}} method (FEM), the results of bending {{conditions}} of the intermediate plate at the bending rolls of a <b>coilbox</b> between the roughing and finishing stands in a hot strip mill were obtained. The intermediate plate was coiled in a <b>coilbox,</b> which effectively overcame the problem of temperature drop by reducing surface area exposed to radiant heat loss during the waiting period. Different states of the plate in the <b>coilbox</b> were simulated by FEM, and the mathematical model of the bending rolls was established, which was {{in accord with the}} simulation results that the plate was coiled. As the bending shape of {{the front end of the}} intermediate plate is crucial to coiling process, the curvatures of the plate were predicted through FEM. In addition, the roll diameter and arrangement affect the optimum curvature, thus the parameters for bending rolls were determined without many adjustments. The developed bending model has been applied to actual <b>coilbox</b> in plant...|$|E
