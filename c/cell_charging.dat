50|$|The {{satellite}} {{was launched}} into a highly elliptical orbit with an initial local time of apogee of 2100 h. The satellite was spin-stabilized at 2.8 rps, with {{the direction of the}} spin axis having a right ascension of 217 degrees and a declination of 23 degrees. Four solar cell paddles mounted near its equator recharged the storage batteries while in orbit. Each experiment except the television scanner had two outputs, digital and analog. A UHF transmitter was used for the digital telemetry and the TV signal. Two VHF transmitters were used to transmit the analog signal. The VHF transmitters were operated continuously. The UHF transmitter was operated for only a few hours each day. Only three of the solar cell paddles fully erected, and this occurred during spin up rather than prior to spin up as planned. Consequently, initial operation of the payload power supply was 63% nominal, and this decreased with time. The decreased power caused a lower signal-to-noise ratio affecting most of the data, especially near apogee. One VHF transmitter failed on September 11, 1959, and the last contact with the payload was made on October 6, 1959, at which time the solar <b>cell</b> <b>charging</b> current had fallen below that required to maintain the satellite equipment.|$|E
40|$|Capacitive {{deionization}} (CDI) is {{a technology}} in which water is desalinated by ion electrosorption into the electric double layers (EDLs) of charging porous electrodes. In recent years significant advances {{have been made}} in modeling the charge and salt dynamics in a CDI cell, but the possible effect of surface transport within diffuse EDLs on these dynamics has not been investigated. We here present theory which includes surface transport in describing the dynamics of a charging CDI cell. Through our numerical solution to the presented models, the possible effect of surface transport on the CDI process is elucidated.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{model for}} transport and the coupled electric field {{is applied to}} simulate a charging lithium-ion cell and investigate the effects of lithium concentration gradients within electrodes on cell performance. The lithium concentration gradients within electrodes {{are affected by the}} cell geometry. Two different geometries are investigated: extending the length of the electrolyte past the edges of the electrodes and extending the length of the cathode past the edge of the anode. It is found that the electrolyte extension has little impact on the behavior of the electrodes, although it does increase the effective conductivity of the electrolyte in the edge region. However, the extension of the cathode past the edge of the anode, and the possibility for electrochemical reactions on the flooded electrode edges, are both found to impact the concentration gradients of lithium in electrodes and the current distribution within the electrolyte during charging. It is found that concentration gradients of lithium within electrodes may have stronger impacts on electrolytic current distributions, depending on the level of completeness of cell charge. This is because very different gradients of electric potential are expected from similar electrode gradients of lithium concentrations at different levels of cell charge, especially for the LixC 6 cathode investigated in this study. This leads to the prediction of significant electric potential gradients along the electrolyte length during early <b>cell</b> <b>charging,</b> and a reduced risk of lithium deposition on the cathode edge during later <b>cell</b> <b>charging,</b> as seen experimentally by others...|$|E

40|$|The Author(s) 2016. Lithium nitrate (LiNO 2) {{is known}} as an {{important}} electrolyte additive in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. The prevailing understanding is that LiNO 2 reacts with metallic lithium anode to form a passivation layer which suppresses redox shuttles of lithium polysulfides, enabling good rechargeability of Li-S batteries. However, this view is seeing more challenges in the recent studies, and above all, the inability of inhibiting polysulfide reduction on Li anode. A closely related issue is the progressive reduction of LiNO 2 on Li anode which elevates internal resistance of the cell and compromises its cycling stability. Herein, we systematically investigated the function of LiNO 2 in redox-shuttle suppression, and propose the suppression {{as a result of}} catalyzed oxidation of polysulfides to sulfur by nitrate anions on or in the proximity of the electrode surface upon <b>cell</b> <b>charging.</b> This hypothesis is supported by both density functional theory calculations and the nitrate anions-suppressed self-discharge rate in Li-S cells. The catalytic mechanism is further validated by the use of ruthenium oxide (RuO 2, a good oxygen evolution catalyst) on cathode, which equips the LiNO 2 -free cell with higher capacity and improved capacity retention over 400 cycles.

40|$|Abstract — Energy {{storage system}} plays an {{important}} role in electric vehicles. In these energy storage systems, a large number of battery cells are usually connected in series to enhance the output voltage for motor driving. The difference in electrochemical characters will cause state-of-charge (SOC) and terminal voltage imbalance between different cells. In the existing system, a hybrid cascaded multilevel converter which involves both battery energy management and motor drives. Each battery cell can be controlled to be connected into the circuit or to be bypassed by a half-bridge converter. All half bridges are cascaded to output a staircase shape dc voltage. Then, an H-bridge converter is used to change the direction of the dc bus voltages to make up ac voltages. The outputs of the converter are multilevel voltages with less harmonics and lower dv/dt, which is helpful to improve the performance of the motor drives. The imbalance of terminal voltage and SOC can also be avoided, Sso the life of the battery stack will be extended. In the proposed system, the level of the multi-level inverter can be increased to further reduce the total harmonic distortion without change in the circuit topology.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} are emission free due to independence from {{fossil fuels and}} it has great advantage of environmental sustainability. Under the pressure of stringent emissions legislation in the future, electrification of the drive train is an option {{in order to meet}} the emission standards law. Even though the battery technology has advanced greatly during the past decade, it still has some limitations. One limitation is the range, which would make only possible to use an electric vehicle in the urban traffic. An owner of a conventional vehicle is usually not having different vehicles for various applications such as driving to work, shopping, holidays, etc. In the case of the fuel cell range extender concept, as shown in figure 1, is an attractive way, which combine both technologies either permanently or on demand and also promotes the introduction of e-mobility as a sustainable vehicle concept. The on-board fuel <b>cell</b> <b>charging</b> system could also carry the tasks of heat management and the air conditioning, which requires new and innovative concepts, so that the range of the electric vehicle could be increased. In this mentioned range extender vehicle concept, the powertrain is driven mainly by the high performance Li-ion battery. In this project, the variant of lithium iron phosphate Li-FePO 4 battery has been used. The on-board fuel cell range extender in this case serves as an additional source of energy unit, which charge the high-performance battery in a low SOC and therefore extend the range. The design of such a vehicle concept is nowadays trend of technology therefore a simulation tool plays a very important role, which allows the prediction of the design. The role of the battery as opposed to the conventional vehicle acts here as the main energy storage, and therefore a study of the essential behavior of the battery must be done. The modeling of the battery was performed partially map-based, which enables a simpler parameterization. Besides the energetic behavior, the thermal behavior also would be described in the model, which is completed by the measurement of the temperature dependent charge and discharge behavior. A comprehensive survey of the behavior of the battery could be done by the integration to the full vehicle model, which are included an on-board fuel cell range extender, power electronics, electric motor, drive train, chassis, and controller cycles. The simulation results could be used as a tool for optimum design for range extender vehicle concepts as shown in the figure 1.

40|$|The Vanadium bromide (V/Br) {{flow cell}} employs the Br 3 -/Br- {{couple in the}} {{positive}} and the V(II) /V(III) couple in the negative half cell. One major issue of this flow cell is bromine gas formation in the positive half cell during charging which results from the low solubility of bromine in aqueous solutions. Bromine complexing agents previously used in the zinc-bromine fuel cell were evaluated for their applicability in V/Br flow cell electrolytes. Three quaternary ammonium bromides: N-ethyl-N-methyl-morpholinium bromide (MEM), N-ethyl-N-methyl-pyrrolidinium bromide (MEP) and Tetra-butyl ammonium bromide (TBA) were studied. It is known that aqueous bromine reacts with quaternary ammonium bromides to form an immiscible organic phase. Depending {{on the number of}} quaternary ammonium bromides used and the environmental temperature, the second phase formed will either be solid or liquid. As any solid formation would interrupt the flow cell operation, potential formation of such kind has to be eliminated. Stability tests of simulated V/Br electrolyte with added quaternary ammonium bromides were carried out at 11, 25 and 40 oC. In the absence of bromine, the addition of MEM, MEP and TBA were found to be stable in V/Br electrolytes. However, in the presence of bromine, solid formation was observed in the bromine rich organic phase when the V/Br electrolyte contained a single quaternary ammonium bromide (QBr) compound. For V/Br electrolytes with binary or ternary QBr mixtures containing TBA, the presence of bromine caused a viscous polybromide phase to form at room temperature and the release of bromine gas at higher temperature. Only a binary mixture of MEM and MEP formed a stable liquid organic phase between 11 &# 150; 40 oC. In this study it was found that V/Br electrolytes containing a binary QBr mixture (0. 75 M) of MEM and MEP gave the best combination that formed an orange oily layer in the presence of bromine without solidification between 11 &# 150; 40 oC. Furthermore, it was found that samples of V/Br electrolytes containing a ternary QBr mixture, are less effective in bromine capturing if the total QBr concentration was less than 1 M at 40 oC, where bromine gas evolution was observed. From electrochemical studies of V 3 +/V 2 +, {{it was found that the}} addition of MEM and MEP had a minimal effect on the formal potential of the V 3 +/V 2 + couple, the V 2 +/V 3 + transfer coefficient and the diffusion coefficient of V 3 +. Therefore, MEM and MEP can be added to the negative half-cell of a V/Br flow cell without major interference From linear sweep voltammetry, the kinetics of the Br-/Br 3 - redox couple was found to be mass transfer controlled. After the addition of MEM and MEP mixture, the exchange current density was found to decrease from 0. 013 Acm- 2 to 0. 01 Acm- 2. On the other hand the transfer coefficient before and after MEM and MEP addition was found to be 0. 5 and 0. 44 respectively. Since the kinetic parameters were not significantly affected by the addition of MEM and MEP mixture, they can be added to the positive half-cell of the V/Br flow cell as bromine complexing agents. The electrochemical studies of both V 3 +/V 2 + and Br-/Br 3 - showed the addition of MEM and MEP has minimal interference with the redox reactions of the vanadium bromide flow cell. This thesis also investigated the effect of MEM and MEP addition on the cell performance of a lab scale V/Br flow cell using two different membranes (ChiNaf and VF 11). Flow cell performance for 2 M V 3. 7 + + 0. 19 M MEM + 0. 56 M MEP electrolytes utilising ChiNaf membrane at 10 mAcm- 2 produced an energy efficiency of 59 %, and this decreased to 43 % after 15 cycles. For the static cell utilising VF 11 membrane, the addition of MEM and MEP reduced the energy efficiency from 59. 7 % to 43. 4 %. It is believed that this is caused by the mass transfer controlled Br-/Br 3 - couple in the complexed positive half-cell solution. Therefore, uniformity between the organic and aqueous phase is important for flow cells utilising electrolytes with MEM and MEP. Finally, the polarization resistance of a lab scale V/Br flow cell utilising ChiNaf membrane and 2 M V 3. 7 + electrolytes was found to be slightly higher during <b>cell</b> <b>charging</b> (3. 9 &# 61527;&# 61472;cm 2) than during the discharge process (3. 6 &# 61527;&# 61472;cm 2), which is opposed to that in the all-vanadium redox cell...|$|E
