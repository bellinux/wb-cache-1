Each converter station was rated at 200 kV, 200 MW {{and consisted of}} two 6-pulse converter bridges in series. Normal operation was with both bridges in service but the scheme could be operated at 50% of rated voltage and power by bypassing one <b>converter</b> <b>group</b> at each end, to allow maintenance to be carried out.|$|E

Classification focuses on identifying two different ac circuit coupled inductor arrangements of the basic buck-boost dc-to-dc converter. Subsequent dc circuit sequential manipulation yields all 11 known, documented, in theory, in simulation and practically, tapped-inductor dc-to-dc converter topologies. The procedure not only generates sequences of topologies, but also generates the voltage transfer functions without recourse to analysis of the circuit internal operating mechanisms. Consequently, two <b>converter</b> classes <b>group</b> the 11 known tapped-inductor topologies, which {{is at least one}} fewer topology classes than universally accepted.

The 10. 5 kV networks supply the thyristor converters allowing fast control of the DC currents in the AUG poloidal field coils. Two methods for improving the load power factor in the present experimental campaign of AUG have been investigated, namely the control of the phase-to-neutral voltage in thyristor converters fitted with neutral thyristors, such as the new 145 MVA modular thyristor <b>converter</b> system (<b>Group</b> 6), and reactive power control achieved by means of static VAr compensators (SVC).

40|$|The {{electrical}} power <b>converter</b> <b>group</b> at CERN {{is responsible for}} the design of fast-pulsed power converters. These generate a flat-top pulse of the order of a few milliseconds. Control of these power converters is orchestrated by an embedded computer, known as the Function Generator/Controller (FGC). The FGC is the main component in the so-called RegFGC 3 chassis, which also houses a variety of purpose-built cards. Ensuring the generation of the pulse at a precise moment, typically when the beam passes, is paramount to the correct behaviour of the accelerator. To that end, the timing distribution and posterior handling by the FGC must be well defined. Also important is the ability to provide operational feedback, and to configure the FGC, the converter, and the pulse characteristics.

40|$|ObjectiveProximal {{attachment}} failure, often {{leading to}} graft migration, is a severe complication of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). Aortic cuffs {{have been used}} to treat proximal attachment failure with mixed results. The Zenith Renu AAA Ancillary Graft (Cook Inc, Bloomington, Ind) is available in two configurations: converter and main body extension. Both provide proximal extension with active fixation for the treatment of pre-existing endovascular grafts with failed or failing proximal fixation or seal in patients who are not surgical candidates. We prospectively compared the outcomes of patient treatment with these two device configurations. MethodsFrom September 2005 to May 2008, a prospective, nonrandomized, postmarket registry was conducted to collect data from 151 patients treated at 95 institutions for proximal aortic endovascular graft failure using the Renu graft. Treatment indications included inadequate proximal fixation or seal, for example, migration, and type I and III endoleak. A total of 136 patients (90 %) had migration, 111 (74 %) had endoleak, and 94 (62 %) had endoleaks and graft migration. AneuRx grafts were present in 126 patients (83 %), of which 89 (59 %) were treated with a converter and 62 (41 %) with a main body extension. Outcomes using converters vs main body extensions for endoleak rates, changes in aneurysm size, and ruptures were compared. ResultsPreprocedural demographics between the two groups did not differ significantly. Procedural success rates were 98 % for the <b>converter</b> <b>group</b> and 100 % for the main body extension group. At a mean follow-up of 12. 8 ± 7. 5 months, no type III endoleaks (0 %) were identified in the <b>converter</b> <b>group,</b> and five (8 %) were identified in the main body extension group. There were no aneurysm ruptures in patients treated with converters (0 %) and three ruptures (5 %) in patients treated with main body extensions. Each patient with aneurysm rupture had been treated with a Renu main body extension, developed a type III endoleak, and underwent surgical conversion. Two of the three patients died postoperatively. ConclusionsProximal attachment failure and graft migration are potentially lethal complications of EVAR. Proximal graft extension using an aortic cuff is the easiest technique for salvaging an endovascular graft. Unfortunately, it has a predictable failure mode (development of a type III endoleak due to component separation) and is associated with a significantly higher failure rate than {{with the use of a}} converter. EVAR salvage with a converter and a femorofemoral bypass is a more complex but superior option for endovascular graft salvage...|$|E

40|$|The Positron Accumulator Ring (PAR) {{consists}} of 8 dipole magnets connected in series. These magnets are energized via one 12 -pulse dc power supply. The power supply {{consists of}} four phase controlled half-wave wye <b>group</b> <b>converters.</b> Each of the two half-wave converters are connected through an interphase transformer to obtain a full-wave converter with 120 {degrees} conduction. The input voltage for these two half-wave converters are 180 {degrees} apart. The two full-wave converters are connected in parallel through a third interphase transformer. This type of connection of the converters not only provides the required output current, it also improves the input power factor of the power supply. The output of the wye <b>group</b> <b>converters</b> is filtered through a passive L-R-C filter to reduce the ripple content of the output current. At low current values of the power supply the current ripple is high, thus a large filter is needed, which adds {{to the cost of}} the power supply, however at high output current levels, the current ripple is less severe. The large size of the filter can be reduced by adding an anti-parallel rectifier diode(D 1) to the output of the power supply. A freewheeling diode(D 2) is connected before the choke to circulate the current once the power supply is turned off. In order to measure the current in the magnet a high precision, low drift, zero flux current transductor is used. This transductor senses the magnet current which provides a feedback signal to control the gating of the converter`s thyristors. A true 14 bit Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) is programmed by the control computer for the required current value, providing a reference for the current regulator. Fast correction of the line transients is provided by a relatively fast voltage loop controlled by a high gain slow response current loop...|$|R
40|$|Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a {{recognized}} risk condition for clinical dementia. This paper attempted {{to explore the}} applicability of a combined cognitive and clinical approach to identify older Chinese adults at-risk of cognitive decline. Seven hundred forty randomly recruited community dwelling participants (aged 60 or over) were assessed at baseline and 2 years with Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and a cognitive battery. Baseline MCI groups were categorized by CDR-MCI, cognitive function (Cog-MCI), and a combined CDR-Cog approach. The cognitive approach adopted the Mayo clinic criteria. For the combined approach, nonamnestic MCI combined CDR 0. 5 plus nonmemory cognitive deficits. The overall concordance between CDR and Cognitive test ratings were 65. 3 % (χ 2 = 256. 4, P< 0. 001, κ= 0. 44). With a combined approach, 424 (57 %) participants were classified as normal. CDR-MCI group had higher cognitive scores compared with MCI groups by other criteria (1 way analysis of variance or ANOVA). At 2 years, the combined CDR-Cog MCI group identified all dementia (N= 24) <b>converters</b> although <b>group</b> differences were not significant. Cognitive function and CDR identified participants potentially at-risk for furthermore decline, but exhibited some differences in detection profiles.

40|$|AbstractThe early {{diagnostic}} {{value of}} glucose hypometabolism and atrophy as potential neuroimaging biomarkers of {{mild cognitive impairment}} (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been extensively explored using [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The vast majority of previous imaging studies neglected the effects of single factors, such as age, symptom severity or time to conversion in MCI thus limiting generalisability of results across studies. Here, we investigated {{the impact of these}} factors on metabolic and structural differences. FDG-PET and MRI data from AD patients (n= 80), MCI converters (n= 65) and MCI non-converters (n= 64) were compared to data of healthy subjects (n= 79). All patient groups were split into subgroups by age, time to conversion (for MCI), or symptom severity and compared to the control group. AD patients showed a strongly age-dependent pattern, with younger patients showing significantly more extensive reductions in gray matter volume and glucose utilisation. In the MCI <b>converter</b> <b>group,</b> the amount of glucose utilisation reduction was linked to the time to conversion but not to atrophy. Our findings indicate that FDG-PET might be more closely linked to future cognitive decline whilst MRI being more closely related to the current cognitive state reflects potentially irreversible damage...|$|E

All patients with an ischemic stroke were divided into normal cognitive group (NCG) and impaired cognition group (ICG) by using a cutoff score on the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE). Patients were additionally classified into 3 subgroups according to the changes in their K-MMSE scores between 3 and 120 months: Stable group with K-MMSE scores changes ranging from 2 ̆ 2122 to + 2 points (2 ̆ 21222 ̆ 0092 ̆ 2642 ̆ 0092 ̆ 5 b 3 MMSE 2 ̆ 0092 ̆ 2642 ̆ 009 + 2); <b>converter</b> <b>group</b> with increase more than 3 points (32 ̆ 0092 ̆ 2642 ̆ 0092 ̆ 5 b 3 MMSE); and reverter group with decrease more than 3 points (2 ̆ 21232 ̆ 0092 ̆ 2642 ̆ 0092 ̆ 5 b 3 MMSE).

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prognostic value of metabolic alterations in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of patients presenting with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) with special regard to the prediction of conversion to definite MS. Methods: Using a 3 T whole-body MR system, a multisequence conventional MRI protocol and single-voxel proton MR spectroscopy (PRESS, repetition time 2000 ms, echo times 38 ms and 140 ms) of the parietal NAWM were performed in 25 patients presenting with CIS at baseline and in 20 controls. Absolute concentrations of N-acetyl-aspartate (tNAA), myo-inositol (Ins), choline (Cho) and creatine (tCr) as well as metabolite ratios were determined. Follow-up including neurological assessment and conventional MRI was performed 3 - 4 and 6 - 7 months after the initial event. Results: Nine patients converted to definite MS during the follow-up period. Compared to controls, those patients who converted to MS also showed significantly lower tNAA concentrations in the NAWM (- 13. 4 %, P= 0. 002) whereas nonconverters (- 6. 5 %, P= 0. 052) did not. The Ins concentration was 20. 2 % higher in the <b>converter</b> <b>group</b> and 1. 9 % higher in the nonconverter group, but these differences did not reach significance. No significant differences could be observed for tCr and Cho in either patient group. Conclusion: Axonal damage at baseline in patients presenting with CIS was more prominent in those who subsequently converted to definite MS in the short term follow-up, indicating that tNAA might be a sufficient prognostic marker for patients with a higher risk of conversion to early definite MS. © 2007 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{and mild}} {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI), continue to be widely studied. While {{there is no consensus}} on whether MCIs actually "convert" to AD, the more important question is not whether MCIs convert, but what is the best such definition. We focus on automatic prognostication, nominally using only a baseline image brain scan, of whether an MCI individual will convert to AD within a multi-year period following the initial clinical visit. This is in fact not a traditional supervised learning problem since, in ADNI, there are no definitive labeled examples of MCI conversion. Prior works have defined MCI subclasses based on whether or not clinical/cognitive scores such as CDR significantly change from baseline. There are concerns with these definitions, however, since e. g. most MCIs (and ADs) do not change from a baseline CDR= 0. 5, even while physiological changes may be occurring. These works ignore rich phenotypical information in an MCI patient's brain scan and labeled AD and Control examples, in defining conversion. We propose an innovative conversion definition, wherein an MCI patient is declared to be a converter if any of the patient's brain scans (at follow-up visits) are classified "AD" by an (accurately-designed) Control-AD classifier. This novel definition bootstraps the design of a second classifier, specifically trained to predict whether or not MCIs will convert. This second classifier thus predicts whether an AD-Control classifier will predict that a patient has AD. Our results demonstrate this new definition leads not only to much higher prognostic accuracy than by-CDR conversion, but also to subpopulations much more consistent with known AD brain region biomarkers. We also identify key prognostic region biomarkers, essential for accurately discriminating the <b>converter</b> and nonconverter <b>groups...</b>|$|R
40|$|International Conference Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease - CTADInternational audienceBackground. The {{morphology}} of {{the brain}} observed in patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the contribution of different biological processes such as the normal aging and the AD-specific pathological matter loss. Being able to differentiate these complementary biological factors is fundamental in order to isolate and quantify the pathological AD-related structural changes, especially at the earliest phase of the disease, at prodromal and preclinical stages. Methods. We chose the ADNI baseline structural MRIs for 37 healthy subjects positive to the CSF Ab 42 (Ab+), 86 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which subsequently converted to AD, 110 stable MCI, and 134 AD patients. For each subject, a "virtual aging" component {{was defined as the}} closest point with respect to the longitudinal deformation modeled for the healthy aging of a group of 63 normal subjects negative to the CSF Ab 42 [1]. Once removed the aging component, the remaining specific morphological changes were analyzed group-wise, in order to characterize the atrophy patterns at the different clinical stages, and to test their predictive power in encoding the pathological disease progression. Results. Even though the considered groups did not significantly differ for age, the estimated virtual ages increased as the clinical condition get worse, and were significantly higher for the MCI stable, <b>converters,</b> and AD <b>groups</b> when compared to the healthy Aβ- (p< 0. 05, standard two sample t-test). After removing the healthy component, the morphological changes specific for the healthy Aβ+ were mild, while the changes specific for the MCI converters were more pronounced and mapped to frontal lobes, ventricles, temporal poles, entorhinal cortex and hippocampi. The same pattern, although slightly more pronounced, was appreciable for the AD patients. The stable MCIs showed a milder deformation pattern, mapping essentially to the ventricles and temporal poles. The predictive power of the specific component was 91 % sensitivity and 84 % specificity for the discrimination AD vs healthy, and 67 % sensitivity and 63 % specificity for the discrimination MCI stable vs MCI converters. Conclusion. We provided a rich description of the anatomical changes observed across the AD time span: normal aging, normal aging at risk, conversion to MCI and latest AD stages. More advanced AD stages were associated to both "virtually older" brains, and to increased specific morphological changes that were not related to the normal aging. Importantly, the specific changes provided a good identification of the pathological AD atrophy. These results provide new insights that can lead to new understandings of the AD dynamics, and to novel techniques for the modeling and the early detection of the disease...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{electric}} power {{has become a}} backbone of the modern society. Together with the growth in possible applications {{of electric}} power, we also see a {{growth in the number}} of devices and the interest of using electrical energy as an environmentally-friendly alternative to other sources of energy. Electrical equipment and the use of electricity develops towards more energy-efficient and high-technology products, This implies at the same time that the power quality is impacted as well. The accelerated use of power electronics, harmonics (LF harmonics, up to about 2 kHz) became an important subject for both engineers and researchers. This included origin, impact and propagation of harmonics. The existing situation is that HF harmonics (above 2 kHz) are taking over the role of LF harmonics as an area of concern in the power system as well as for end-user equipment. The driving forces behind the increasing levels of HF harmonics are the increased introduction of energy-efficient and high-technology products and, ironically enough, the limitation of LF harmonics among others using active <b>converters.</b> The research <b>group</b> at Luleå University of Technology, to which the author of this thesis belongs, is one of the few groups in the world that has studied different aspects of HF harmonics. A number of reasons have been identified for the lack of research on this subject: the fast development in technology; the lack of suitable measurement equipment; but most importantly the fact that this subject requires input from different engineering disciplines: electronics; electromagnetic compatibility (EMC); and power engineering. The last few years have however seen a fast growth in interest in the area, with several companies and universities contacting our group. The resonance phenomena, one of the main areas of concern for LF harmonics, are also a concern of HF harmonics but obviously at higher frequencies where experience and suitable measurement equipment was missing. Resonance phenomena in this frequency range have been identified by other researchers, but in relation to dc distribution or in relation to the testing of equipment. Common-mode resonance phenomena in the (ac) low-voltage distribution are treated in this thesis, whereas differential-mode resonances are studied in a parallel project. The aim of this thesis is to show the origin, propagation, impact and treatment of HF harmonics when modern equipment is connected to the low-voltage power distribution. The description is based on the existing knowledge on LF harmonics and the ongoing work, globally, on EMC, end-user equipment and power distribution. The title of the thesis "The zone concept - Design of low-voltage installations considering the spread of High- frequency harmonics" has been chosen to emphasize the need for electromagnetic compatibility and high power quality. This can only be achieved through interplay between end-user equipment and the electrical installation. An essential part in the zone concept is the limitation of the spread of HF harmonics through series filters, which may be power transformers, and through shunt elements to prevent high levels of disturbance especially due to resonances. Such shunt elements close the current path by lowering the impedance in the HF harmonic frequency range and can help in preventing resonance phenomena by introducing active losses. It is further shown in this thesis that many of the means to limit HF harmonics, e. g. transformers, can also be used to limit LF harmonics.

Spatial memory functions between aMCI converters and nonconverters are also compared using VRAM results. Methods: We assessed the spatial memory in 20 normal controls, 20 aMCI, and 20 mild AD subjects using VRAM. The Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and other neuropsychological tests {{were given to the}} subjects in conjunction with the VRAM test. Scores in working memory errors and reference memory errors were compared among the three groups using repeated measures analysis of variance. In addition, aMCI patients were followed-up after 5 years and surveyed for AD conversion rate. Results: In AD patients, both spatial working and reference memory were impaired. However, in aMCI subjects, only spatial reference memory was impaired. Significant spatial reference memory impairment was found in the aMCI <b>converter</b> <b>group</b> when compared to the nonconverter group. Conclusion: Spatial working memory is less impaired in aMCI while reference memory is similarly damaged in AD. In aMCI patients, more severe spatial reference memory deficit is a neuropsychological marker for AD conversion.

Sequential HRT images 16 - 21 months apart were obtained for each subject and segmental optic disc parameters were measured to {{determine if}} any change had occurred. From the analysis of sequential HRT images of the 21  normal eyes we established normal limits of interimage variation. Individual discs in each group showing changes above the 95 % limit of normal variability were then sought.  RESULTS—Several segmental and global optic disc parameters were found to show significant change in the <b>converter</b> <b>group</b> before confirmed visual field change, confirming our previously published results. Individual optic disc analysis using the 95 % limit of normal variability data demonstrated glaucomatous change in 13  out of 21  converter eyes. 47  of the 164  OHT eyes with normal visual fields showed change in global and segmental parameters in a "glaucomatous" direction above the level expected for normal variability. The parameters which changed most frequently in the OHT eyes were: global cup volume (6. 7 % of discs), inferonasal cup volume (11 %), inferotemporal cup volume (8. 5 %), and superotemporal cup area (7. 3 %).   CONCLUSIONS—We have identified change in a subset of ocular hypertensive patients which could predate the development of glaucomatous visual field loss. The HRT could be of value in the sequential follow up of those suspected of having glaucoma by identifying eyes at risk of developing glaucoma. However, further refinement of the technique is required to eliminate some of the inherent variability of the analysis method described, and to increase the ability to detect at risk individuals. ...|$|E
