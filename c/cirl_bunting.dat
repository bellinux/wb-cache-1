5|$|It {{was one of}} the texts, {{along with}} Thomas Bewick's {{contemporaneous}} A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804) that made ornithology popular in Britain, and, with the 1676 Ornithologia libri tres of Francis Willughby and John Ray, helped to make it the object of serious study. The book includes a description of the <b>cirl</b> <b>bunting,</b> discovered by Montagu in 1800 near his home in Kingsbridge, Devon.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire body}} {{of the book is}} {{arranged}} as a dictionary from Aberdevine ('Vide Siskin.) on page 58 (the pages are however not numbered in the original) to Yelper ('Vide Avoset.) on page 687. Since the book does not have a continuous narrative to summarise, the account here will use one species as a running example to illustrate the book's approach. The <b>cirl</b> <b>bunting</b> is chosen because it was discovered by Montagu and is associated in Britain with his home town of Kingsbridge, Devon. He also chose the species for the colour frontispiece of the book.|$|E
500|$|The {{entry for}} each species varies in length from half a page, as for BUNTING-GREEN-HEADED (which is {{dismissed}} as [...] "no {{other than an}} accidental variety of the female Yellow Bunting") to three pages (as for BUNTING-CIRL). The <b>cirl</b> <b>bunting</b> entry begins by citing the known authorities on the species, with the names they used for it: ...|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the entry}} is written in {{continuous}} prose, starting with a physical description giving length, weight, and {{a detailed account of}} plumage with differences between the sexes (more than a page in the <b>cirl</b> <b>bunting's</b> case). Montagu then describes the species' distribution, nesting (nest structure, number of eggs, nesting period), differences from similar species, and other observations.|$|R
30|$|The {{more data}} are trawled for {{patterns}}, {{the more likely}} it is that the patterns found will simply reflect chance associations. This might be innocuous as long as we are comparing clearly unrelated variables, such as those shown in Figure  1. But if environmental scientists find a chance correlation between two variables that just happen to have a plausible functional cause and effect relationship, then there is a higher risk of misinterpretation. Where there is a choice, this is why policy-makers will often place more confidence in evidence from scientific studies that have both control groups and treatment groups, and where the individual study units have been allocated to these different groups based on some random allocation process that is not possible to predict. Without a control group (i.e. study units that are dealt with in exactly the same way as study units in the experimental group except for the treatment applied), it is difficult to determine whether a given treatment really had an effect or whether, for example, there was a natural change over time in the outcome of interest that may be unconnected with the treatment. Without random allocation of study units to control and treatment groups, it is difficult to ensure that the groups are balanced at baseline with respect to known and unknown determinants of outcome, and therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether variances in outcomes were caused by the treatment/intervention of interest. An example of an environmental study affected by the lack of random allocation of study units to control and treatment groups is provided by Peach et al. [3], who attempted to assess the effect of Countryside Stewardship Schemes (CSS) on populations of <b>cirl</b> <b>buntings</b> (Emberiza cirlus). This study surveyed the entire geographic range of the species, between 1992 and 1998, and compared changes in the abundance of <b>cirl</b> <b>buntings</b> in tetrads (2 [*]×[*] 2  km squares) over time. There was some evidence, however, that the selection of sites to be managed under the CSS (though not carried out by the investigators) may not have been random and may have been related to the outcome of interest. The authors acknowledge that ‘the relatively high densities of <b>cirl</b> <b>buntings</b> in 1992 on land that subsequently entered CSS agreements probably reflects a tendency for sites already supporting <b>cirl</b> <b>buntings</b> to be more likely to apply for, and be offered, CSS status. Many of the CSS agreements…include Sites of Special Scientific Interest or County Wildlife Sites, and landowners of sites known to support <b>cirl</b> <b>buntings</b> have been encouraged to apply for CSS status’ [3].|$|R
5|$|Females and juveniles, {{especially}} of the pale eastern subspecies, E. c. erythrogenys, may be confused with pine buntings, but they always have a yellow tint to their plumage, a paler rufous rump and more uniform upperparts than that species. Young and female yellowhammers can be distinguished from <b>cirl</b> <b>buntings</b> by the grey-brown rump of the latter species. Male hybrids with pine bunting are typically white-faced and have some yellow on the head, underparts or flight feathers, but females are usually indistinguishable from yellowhammers.|$|R
500|$|The {{entry for}} the <b>cirl</b> <b>bunting</b> {{states that it}} was {{discovered}} by Montagu [...] "in the winter of 1800" [...] {{near his home in}} Kingsbridge, Devon. He records that the species is indigenous to Devon and [...] "confined to the southern parts of that county contiguous to the coast", as it remains in the twentyfirst century.|$|E
500|$|The {{song of the}} cock {{yellowhammer}} is {{a series}} of short notes, gradually increasing in volume and followed by one or two more protracted notes. It is often represented as [...] "A little bit of bread and no cheese", and the full version can be confused with the almost identical song of the pine bunting. If the final notes are omitted, confusion with the <b>cirl</b> <b>bunting</b> is possible. Other vocalisations include a zit contact call, a see alarm, and a trilled tirrr given in flight.|$|E
500|$|From Wembury {{the path}} travels east into the South Hams {{district}} to the Warren Point Ferry, across the River Yealm, near Newton Ferrers. The River Erme near Kingston must be forded at Erme Mouth within {{one hour of}} low tide. The path then goes past Hillsea Point Rock. [...] The view to the southwest is then over Bigbury Bay past Burgh Island and Hope Cove to the promontory known as Bolt Tail. The next 6miles (10km) of cliff top paths from Bolberry Down past Bolt Head and the tidal ria of Kingsbridge Estuary to Prawle Point, belong to the National Trust. The estuary is crossed using the Salcombe Ferry, from Salcombe to East Portlemouth, close to Salcombe Castle and within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The path passes through the Prawle Point and Start Point Site of Special Scientific Interest which is recognised as being an important site for solitary bees and wasps, the rare cuckoo bee Nomada sexfasciata, and the <b>Cirl</b> <b>bunting.</b>|$|E
5|$|The bird family Emberizidae {{contains}} around 300 seed-eating species, {{the majority}} of which {{are found in the}} Americas, although the genus Emberiza, with more than forty members, is confined to the Old World. Within its genus, the yellowhammer is most closely related to the pine bunting, with which it forms a superspecies; they have at times been considered as one species. The white-capped and <b>cirl</b> <b>buntings</b> are also near relatives of the species pair. Where their ranges meet, the yellowhammer and pine bunting interbreed; the yellowhammer is dominant, and the hybrid zone is moving further east.|$|R
40|$|Carotenoids are {{responsible}} for the bright red and yellow plumage of birds. These substances cannot be synthesised by birds and must be obtained from the diet and transported through the blood to the feathers. The carot­ enoid content of blood was measured in <b>Cirl</b> <b>Buntings</b> Emberiza cirlus, a species with sexually dimorphic yellow plumage. Carotenoid concentra­ tion, estimated from the coloration of the plasma, was higher in males than in females and juveniles. These differences were unrelated to the greater in­ cidence of feather moult in males. Although the reasons for the differences are not understood, the results of this and two previous studies suggest that, in species with sexually dichromatic plumage, the quantity of carotenoids transported in the blood is higher in the more brightly coloured sex.

2500|$|How can {{understanding}} of species' natural history aid their effective conservation in human-dominated ecosystems? [...] Humans often conduct activities {{that allow for}} the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or {{as a result of}} a focus on nature. [...] Traditional natural history can only inform how best to do this to a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically. [...] However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated ecosystems, through what is known as focused natural history. [...] Rosenzweig [...] cites four examples: shrikes (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden fence post perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable steel fence posts contributed to their decline. [...] Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes. [...] Additionally, the <b>cirl</b> <b>bunting</b> (Emberiza cirlus) thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant winter grain crops, natterjack toads (Bufo calamatus) declined when reductions in sheep grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of wildfires prevented its return after timbering. [...] Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} that W. E. Henley once took me severely to task {{on account of}} some jeering remarks made about our poet's way of treating the birds and their neglect {{of so many of}} our charming singers. In the course of our correspondence he questioned me about the <b>cirl</b> <b>bunting,</b> that lively singer and pretty first cousin of the yellow hammer; and after I had supplied him with full information, he informed me that it was his intention to write a poem on that bird, and that he would be the first English poet to sing the <b>cirl</b> <b>bunting.</b>|$|E
60|$|Among the rarer fringilline {{birds on}} the common were the <b>cirl</b> <b>bunting,</b> {{bullfinch}} and goldfinch, the last two rarely seen. Linnets, however, were abundant, now gathered in small flocks composed mainly of young birds in plain plumage, with here and there an individual showing the carmine-tinted breast of the adult male. Unhappily, a dreary fate was in store {{for many of these}} blithe twitterers.|$|E
6000|$|The blackbird, {{like the}} thrush, {{sometimes}} borrows a note or a phrase, and, like the thrush again, if reared by hand he {{may become a}} nuisance by mimicking some disagreeable sound, and using it by way of song. I {{heard of such a}} case a short time ago at Sidmouth. The ground floor of the house where I lodged was occupied by a gentleman who had a fondness for bird music, and being an invalid confined to his rooms, he kept a number of birds in cages. He had, besides canaries, the thrush, chaffinch, linnet, goldfinch and <b>cirl</b> <b>bunting.</b> I remarked {{that he did not have}} the best singer of all--the blackbird. He said that he had procured one, or that some friend had sent him one, a very beautiful ou?el cock in the blackest plumage and with the orange-tawniest bill, and he had anticipated great pleasure from hearing its fluting melody. But alas! no blackbird song did this unnatural blackbird sing. He had learnt to bark like a dog, and whenever the singing spirit took him he would bark once or twice or three times, and then, after an interval of silence of the proper length, about fifteen seconds, he would bark again, and so on until he had had his fill of music for the time. The barking got on the invalid's nerves, and he sent the bird away. [...] "It was either that," [...] he said, [...] "or losing my senses altogether." ...|$|E
