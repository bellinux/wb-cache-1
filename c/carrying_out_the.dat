5|$|According to the Polish {{historian}} Tadeusz Mańczuk, Piłsudski – who {{was planning}} a coup d'état in Kaunas – discouraged the local PMO activists from <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Sejny Uprising. Piłsudski reasoned that any hostilities could leave Lithuanians even more {{opposed to the}} proposed union with Poland (see Międzymorze). The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched the uprising. While locally successful, {{it led to the}} failure of the nationwide coup.|$|E

5|$|Although their {{suspected}} {{white supremacist}} affiliations led federal authorities to investigate possible ties {{to a larger}} group, authorities later downplayed the trio as drug addicts who had little chance of actually <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> plot.

The study was expected to provide a short-list of routes, which would then be the subject of further consultation.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the {{uprising}} was doomed by poor communication and the overeagerness {{of some of}} the PMO activists. Piłsudski failed to discourage local PMO activists from <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Sejny Uprising in the Suwałki Region. The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched {{the uprising}}, which while locally successful, led to the failure of the nationwide coup. PMO members in Lithuania stated that the Sejny uprising had damaged their reputation, and many of its former supporters rejected calls by PMO recruiters.|$|E

5|$|As {{the oldest}} parts of Monte Testaccio {{are at the}} bottom of the mound, it is {{difficult}} to say with any certainty when it was first created. Deposits found by excavators have been dated to a period between approximately AD 140 to 250, but it is possible that dumping could have begun on the site as early as the 1st century BC. The mound has a roughly triangular shape comprising two distinct platforms, the eastern side being the oldest. At least four distinct series of terraces were built in a stepped arrangement. Layers of small sherds were laid down in some places, possibly to serve as paths for those <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> waste disposal operations.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} on March 15, 44 BC. The {{assassination}} {{was led by}} Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus. Most of the conspirators were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms {{in favor of the}} landless classes. Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The civil war that followed destroyed {{what was left of the}} Republic.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{service as}} sheriff was unremarkable; biographer Rexford Tugwell {{described}} {{the time in}} office as a waste for Cleveland politically. Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff's office during his tenure and chose not to confront it. A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed, who {{had been convicted of}} murdering his mother. As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task. In spite of reservations about the hanging, Cleveland executed Morrissey himself; he hanged another murderer, John Gaffney, on February 14, 1873.|$|E

5|$|Five crew residencies {{took place}} over the station's lifespan, in late 1977-early 1978, late 1978, mid-1979, mid-1980, and early 1981, {{including}} cosmonauts from Warsaw Pact countries {{as part of the}} Intercosmos programme. These crews were responsible for <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> primary missions of Salyut 6, including astronomy, Earth-resources observations and the study of the effect of spaceflight on the human body. Following the completion of these missions and the launch of its successor, Salyut 7, Salyut 6 was deorbited on 29 July 1982, almost five years after its launch.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Germans {{allowed the}} Judenrat {{to set up}} a {{judicial}} system. Before this, justice was administered solely by Gens and his policemen; after this, Gens' department still retained some judicial functions over injuries to policemen, escapes from the jail, or leaving the ghetto without leave. In June 1942, Gens took the responsibility for <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> death sentence imposed on five men from the ghetto who had been convicted of murder. A sixth man, convicted of committing a murder in another ghetto, was hanged at the same time. Some residents accused the Jewish police force of taking bribes at the gates leading into the ghetto. The police also organized parties which were occasionally attended by Gestapo.|$|E

In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of the Armistice Agreement, the Hungarian authorities then extradited them to Yugoslavia, where they underwent a fourth trial in Novi Sad in October 1946. They were all sentenced to death and executed the following month.|$|E
