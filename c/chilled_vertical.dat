40|$|A furnace {{has been}} built {{for the purpose of}} {{producing}} anisotropic porous metals through solid-gas eutectic solidification. This process allows control of continuously formed anisotropic pores in metals and was discovered at the State Metallurgical Academic' University in Dnepropetrovsk Ukraine. The process incorporates hydrogen gas within the metal as it solidifies from the molten state. Metals which do not form hydrides, including iron, nickel, aluminum, copper and others can be formed in this manner. The furnace is housed within a ~. 64 meter&sup 3; (30 ft&sup 3;) ASME code stamped cylindrical stainless steel vacuum/pressure vessel. The vessel is a water <b>chilled</b> <b>vertical</b> cylinder with removable covers at the top and bottom. It can be evacuated to 20 mTorr or pressurized to 5. 5 MPa (800 psi). A charge of 2700 cc (167 in&sup 3;) of molten metal can be melted in a crucible in the upper portion within a watercooled 30 cm (12 in.) ID induction coil. A 175 kW Inductotherm power source energizes the coil. Vertical actuation of a ceramic stopper rod allows the molten metal to be tapped into a solidification mold beneath the melting crucible. The cylindrical mold rests on a water cooled copper base inducing directional solidification from the bottom. Mixtures of hydrogen and argon gases are introduced during the process. The system is remotely controlled and located in a structure with frangible walls specially designed for possible ambient pressure excursions as a result of equipment failure. This paper includes a general description of the furnace and operating procedure and {{a detailed description of the}} control, monitoring and interlock systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} funded by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE RP- 1462). It is a three years’ research, {{including}} the literature review, labs construction, experiments and data analysis. In this thesis, first of all, we conducted literature review of mechanism motion influence on heat and mass transfer and additive effect in absorption chiller. This part helps us understand the basic idea of how mechanism motion affects the heat and mass transfer of sorption fluids and gives us reference on how to select the experiment instrument and the experiment operation range. In the second part, the instrument selection and lab construction are introduced. A commercial absorption <b>chiller,</b> a <b>vertical</b> vibration table and a statistic water loop system are used in our lab. This test facility has the capability of realizing mechanism motion in real systems with adjustable wide range vibration and long term stabilized auxiliary water supply. A commercial absorption chiller with a capacity of 10 kW is utilized in this project. A water loop system was constructed to maintain a repetitive experimental condition when the outdoor conditions change. We also installed a data acquisition system for in-line measurement of the solution concentration and temperature and flow rate of the solution and water loops. We can use these measurements to calculate the heat and mass transfer capacity in the absorber in steady-state. The enhancement is obtained by comparing the temperature differences, before a vibration and during a vibration. In the third section, we illustrate the methodology of how to analyze the heat and mass transfer in the absorber and the data under different conditions. We separate the experiment into three big groups, including the conditions without additive, with n-octanol additive and with 2 -ethylhexanol(2 EH) additive. Different film thickness (spray amount), vibration frequency, and vibration amplitude comparisons were considered under each condition. And we also cross-compared all these three groups. The results of this project revealed the optimal frequency and amplitude combinations (at 25 Hz 2 ̆ 6 0. 2 mm) for the absorption chiller tested in this study. The results of this project provided information filling the knowledge gap {{about the influence of}} mechanical motion in absorption chiller technology. Advisor: Yuebin Y...|$|R
