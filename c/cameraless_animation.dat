5000|$|Direct {{animation}} can be {{an inexpensive}} way to produce a film; it can even be done on outtakes, or discarded film strips from other projects. It {{is a form of}} animation that is inviting to beginners and accomplished artists alike. Norman McLaren wrote a short illustrated introduction [...] "How to make animated movies without a camera" [...] which was originally published by UNESCO in 1949. Helen Hill published a collection called Recipes for Disaster that includes a wide range of approaches to creating images directly on film. Today, <b>cameraless</b> <b>animation</b> is being produced worldwide.|$|E

Eventually, the thesis research resulted {{in the development of}} an environmental performance that integrates projected light, projection screens and live performance. A variety of materials for screens were examined in order to determine their transparent and light reflecting qualities and to devise a transparent luminous surface. Among those examined were pelon, nylon, silk, fiberglass, plexiglas, vinyl, and aluminum netting. Included in the investigation was a review of projection equipment, lamp housings, projector bulb specifications, filament design and performance data. In an attempt to control sequence and to create movement of colored images, 16 mm film projection, optical printing and <b>cameraless</b> <b>animation</b> techniques were utilized. Manipulation of stained glass and glass dyes resulted in a series of colored glass slides for still projection. Work with black film leader resulted in abandoning the traditional rectangular film frame, making it possible for light images to take on the shapes of various projection surfaces. The development of a multi-layered screen configuration followed, allowing the projected light images to be duplicated in space, by penetrating one transparent screen after another. Further exploration led to the design of a projection device that would become integral with the performance environment. Earlier research included experimentation with prisms and lenses. The final lighting design, consists of cylindrical tubes and small tungsten-halogen filament bulbs in conjunction with lantern slide projection. Finally, the problems of interaction between live performer and stage environment and how to harmonize the three-dimensionality of the human performer with the projectors and inanimate objects in the performance environment became major concerns. A general survey of technical, historical and stylistic developments regarding this issue was helpful in solving these problems. The thesis project is an original design which addresses this issue and demonstrates an original concept for spatial projection and human performance. The human performer interacts with the staged environment by becoming, at times, a prop, and at other times, a projection screen. by Sharon Haggins-Dunn. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)
