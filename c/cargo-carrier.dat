40|$|The {{self-assembly}} {{of objects}} {{with a set}} of desired properties is a major goal of material science and physics. A particularly challenging problem is that of self-assembling structures with a target topology. Here we show by computer simulation that one may design the geometry of string-like rigid patchy templates to promote their efficient and reproducible self-assembly into a selected repertoire of non-planar closed folds including several knots. In particular, by controlling the template geometry, we can direct the assembly process so as to strongly favour the formation of constructs tied in trefoil or pentafoil, or even of more exotic torus knots. Polydisperse and racemic mixtures of helical fragments of variable composition add further tunability in the topological self-assembly we discovered. Our results should be relevant to the design of new ways to synthesize molecular knots, which may prove, for instance, to be efficient <b>cargo-carriers</b> due to their mechanical stability. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited...|$|R

6000|$|Fifty hulls, at least, moulded on {{lines of}} beauty and speed--hulls of wood, of iron, expressing in their forms the highest {{achievement}} of modern ship-building--lay moored all in a row, stem to quay, as if assembled there for an exhibition, not of a great industry, but of a great art. Their colours were gray, black, dark green, with a narrow strip of yellow moulding defining their sheer, or with a row of painted ports decking in warlike decoration their robust flanks of <b>cargo-carriers</b> that would know no triumph but of speed in carrying a burden, no glory other than of a long service, no victory but that of an endless, obscure contest with the sea. The great empty hulls with swept holds, just out of dry-dock, with their paint glistening freshly, sat high-sided with ponderous dignity alongside the wooden jetties, looking more like unmovable buildings than things meant to go afloat; others, half loaded, far {{on the way to}} recover the true sea-physiognomy of a ship brought down to her load-line, looked more accessible. Their less steeply slanting gangways seemed to invite the strolling sailors in search of a berth to walk on board and try [...] "for a chance" [...] with the chief mate, the guardian of a ship's efficiency.

And for a good quarter of a mile, from the dockyard gate to the farthest corner, where the old housed-in hulk, the President (drill-ship, then, of the Naval Reserve), used to lie with her frigate side rubbing against the stone of the quay, above all these hulls, ready and unready, a hundred and fifty lofty masts, more or less, held out the web of their rigging like an immense net, in whose close mesh, black against the sky, the heavy yards seemed to be entangled and suspended.|$|R

50|$|After {{processing}} is complete, mRNA {{needs to}} be transported from the cell nucleus to cytoplasm. This is a three-step process involving the generation of a <b>cargo-carrier</b> complex in the nucleus followed by translocation of the complex through the nuclear pore complex and finally release of the cargo into cytoplasm.

5000|$|In June 2009 at {{the same}} public hearing of the Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee, Shuttle Program Manager John Shannon {{unveiled}} a preliminary concept for a new [...] "side-mount" [...] variant SDV.

[...] This concept would be somewhat similar to the Shuttle-C, but with the Shuttle Orbiter replaced by a keel and boattail structure permanently affixed to the ET (as opposed to the detachable <b>cargo-carrier</b> on Shuttle-C). Three SSMEs would be mounted in the boattail, essentially a simplified Orbiter boattail, and a large expendable fairing would encapsulate the payload. The entire vehicle, including SSMEs, would be discarded after launch. Shannon presented the concept for both cargo-only operation, and crewed missions using the Orion spacecraft and its launch escape system. While requiring far less development than the Ares vehicles, the basic configuration of the vehicle would in a 2-launch lunar architecture be less capable than the currently envisioned Ares I and Ares V mission scenario.|$|E
40|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} eukaryotic cells is the possession of a nuclear envelope. Transport of macromolecules between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments occurs through nuclear pore complexes that span the double membrane of this envelope. The molecular basis for transport has been revealed only within the last few years. The transport mechanism lacks motors and pumps and instead operates by a process of facilitated diffusion of soluble carrier proteins, in which vectoriality is provided by compartment-specific assembly and disassembly of <b>cargo-carrier</b> complexes. The carriers recognize localization signals on the cargo and can bind to pore proteins. They also bind a small GTPase, Ran, whose GTP-bound form is predominantly nuclear. Ran-GTP dissociates import carriers from their cargo and promotes the assembly of export carriers with cargo. The ongoing discovery of numerous carriers, Ran-independent transport mechanisms, and cofactors highlights {{the complexity of the}} nuclear transport process. Multiple regulatory mechanisms are also being identified that control <b>cargo-carrier</b> interactions. Circadian rhythms, cell cycle, transcription, RNA processing, and signal transduction are all regulated at the level of nucleocytoplasmic transport. This review focuses on recent discoveries in the field, with an emphasis on the carriers and cofactors involved in transport and on possible mechanisms for movement through the nuclear pores...|$|E

40|$|DNA nanoconstructs are a {{potential}} drug carrier with high biocompatibility. They are promising particularly when therapeutic nucleic acids are the cargos to be delivered, since both the carrier and the cargo are nucleic acids {{which can be}} designed, synthesized and assembled in a seamless feature without using post-synthetic conjugation chemistry. However, the unwanted base-paring events between the cargo and the carrier may potentially disturb the desired structure of the cargo-loaded carrier. To address this concern, we propose a DNA nanocarrier composed of L-DNA strands having a bioorthogonal base-paring system.

40|$|SUMMARY In this thesis, novel polycationic vectors for {{therapeutic}} gene delivery were introduced with {{the focus on}} structure-function relationship in both physicochemical and biological aspects. First the transfection related differences of classical vectors with high and low branching grade and charge density: PEI and PLL, were examined under pH-alternating tumor tissue conditions. Further structural design for siRNA delivery was proposed on base of PEG-PCL-PEI multifunctional self-assembly ABC-construct, showing the importance of total hydrophilic-lipophilic balance for efficient gene silencing performance. For DNA delivery a new low molecular weight di-block pDMAEMA derivative was synthesized and characterized, proving {{it to be a}} low toxic and efficient vector. The relationship between pHEMA-content and polymer chain flexibility was assessed via molecular dynamics simulation (MD). The thermodynamic polymer-DNA binding characteristics, monitored via ITC, appeared to depend on glass transition temperatue (Tg). The use of both MD and ITC methodologies provided new information on the <b>cargo-carrier</b> self-assembly process in solution, relevant to transfection performance of diblock-copolymers...|$|E
40|$|Since {{a couple}} of years the DLR {{launcher}} systems analysis division is investigating a visionary and extremely fast passenger transportation concept based on rocket propulsion. The fully reusable concept consists of two vertically launched winged stages in parallel arrangement. The space transportation role of the SpaceLiner concept as a TSTO-launcher is now, for the first time, addressed in technical detail. Different mission options to LEO and beyond are traded and necessary modifications of the passenger stage to an unmanned <b>cargo-carrier</b> are investigated and described in this paper. Meanwhile, technical progress of the SpaceLiner ultra-high-speed passenger transport is ongoing at Phase A conceptual design level. Iterative sizings of all major subcomponents in nominal and off-nominal flight conditions have been performed. Potential intercontinental flight routes, taking into account range-safety and sonic boom constraints as well as good reachability from major business centers, are evaluated and flight guidance schemes are established. Alternative passenger cabin and rescue capsule options with innovative morphing shapes were also investigated. The operational and business concept of the SpaceLiner is under definition.

40|$|Restricted until 14 Feb. 2009. Peptides {{characterized}} as protein transduction domain peptides (PTD) or membrane transduction peptides (MTP) have recently attracted attention as {{a novel approach}} for the efficient intracellular delivery of oligopeptides, oligonucleotides and other bioactive macromolecules, primarily into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. However, {{the effect of the}} linkage between cargo and its cationic oligopeptide carrier on the internalization, intracellular processing and biological activity of the cargo has not been fully deliberated. In this thesis, the cellular processing of conjugates of PTDs and the nuclear encoded apoptotic protein cytochrome c prepared with either a disulfide or a thioether linkage is studied and the conjugates used as a tool {{to learn more about the}} intracellular fate of cationic oligopeptides. The results from this work, performed in multiple cell lines, including CHO, U 937 and HeLa, show that the uptake of the conjugates is increased when compared to that of cytochrome c alone. In HeLa cells, apoptotic activity of cytochrome c is observed only in the thioether conjugate, but not in the cytochrome c or the disulfide conjugate. However, apoptosis is restored in the disulfide conjugate with the addition of the proteasome inhibitor, MG 132. Furthermore, the addition of MG 132 resulted in an increase of apoptotic activity in cytochrome c. Conceivably, MG 132 can protect cytochrome c, either in the native form or as a product released from the disulfide conjugate, from degradation by proteasomes. This model is further supported by the finding that treatment with acetaminophen, a glutathione depleting agent, markedly enhances the apoptotic effect of the disulfide conjugate, but not of the cytochrome c or the thioether conjugate. This result suggests that not only does the preservation of the <b>cargo-carrier</b> complex not hinder the cargo's biological activity, it is required for the retention of the conjugate's biological activity...|$|E
