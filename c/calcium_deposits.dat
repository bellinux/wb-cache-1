5|$|The K–Pg {{boundary}} {{represents one}} of the most dramatic turnovers in the fossil record for various calcareous nanoplankton that formed the <b>calcium</b> <b>deposits</b> that gave the Cretaceous its name. The turnover in this group is clearly marked at the species level. Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions, than by a decrease in speciation. The K–Pg boundary record of dinoflagellates is not so well understood, mainly because only microbial cysts provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, thereby, likely causing diversity to be underestimated. Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer.|$|E

40|$|The role {{of calcium}} oxalate {{crystals}} and deposits in UTI pathogenesis {{has not been}} established. The objectives {{of this study were}} to identify bacteria present in pediatric urolithiasis and, using in vitro and in vivo models, to determine the relevance of <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposits</b> during experimental pyelonephritis. Pediatric kidney stones and urine were collected and both cultured and sequenced for bacteria. Bacterial adhesion to calcium oxalate was compared. Murine kidney <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposits</b> were induced by intraperitoneal glyoxalate injection and kidneys were transurethrally inoculated with uropathogenic Escherichia coli to induce pyelonephritis. E. coli of the family Enterobacteriaceae was identified in patients by calcium oxalate stone culture. Additionally Enterobacteriaceae DNA was sequenced from multiple calcium oxalate kidney stones. E. coli selectively aggregated on and around calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. Mice inoculated with glyoxalate and uropathogenic E. coli had higher bacterial burdens, increased kidney <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposits</b> and an increased kidney innate immune response compared to mice with only <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposits</b> or only pyelonephritis. In a murine model, the presence of <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposits</b> increases pyelonephritis risk, likely due to preferential aggregation of bacteria on and around calcium oxalate crystals. When both <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposits</b> and uropathogenic bacteria were present, <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposit</b> number increased along with renal gene transcription of inner stone core matrix proteins increased. Therefore renal <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposits</b> may be a modifiable risk factor for infections of the kidney and urinary tract. Furthermore, bacteria may be present in <b>calcium</b> oxalate <b>deposits</b> and potentially contribute to calcium oxalate renal disease...|$|R

2500|$|Calcification forms among {{vascular}} {{smooth muscle}} {{cells of the}} surrounding muscular layer, specifically in the muscle cells adjacent to atheromas and {{on the surface of}} atheroma plaques and tissue. In time, as cells die, this leads to extracellular <b>calcium</b> <b>deposits</b> between the muscular wall and outer portion of the atheromatous plaques. With the atheromatous plaque interfering with the regulation of the calcium deposition, it accumulates and crystallizes. [...] A similar form of an intramural calcification, presenting the picture of an early phase of arteriosclerosis, appears to be induced by a number of drugs that have an antiproliferative mechanism of action (Rainer Liedtke 2008).|$|E
40|$|AbstractCalcific {{aortic valve}} disease (CAVD) {{is a leading}} {{cardiovascular}} disorder in the elderly. While aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) are the main cells that express osteogenic mediators, the molecular mechanism that mediates AVIC osteogenic responses is incompletely understood. This study aims to identify pro-osteogenic factors in human AVICs affected by CAVD. Methods and resultsMicroarray analysis identified 11 up-regulated genes in AVICs of diseased valves. Among these genes, mRNA levels of neurotrophin 3 (NT 3) increased by 2 fold. Higher levels of NT 3 protein in diseased aortic valves and diseased AVICs were confirmed by immunofluorescent staining and immunoblotting, respectively. An exposure of AVICs of normal valves to recombinant human NT 3 (0. 025 – 0. 10 μg/mL) up-regulated the production of Runx 2, TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2 in a dose-dependent fashion. NT 3 also promotes <b>calcium</b> <b>deposit</b> formation. The pro-osteogenic effect of NT 3 was not affected by neutralization of Toll-like receptor 2 or 4. Interestingly, mRNA encoding neural growth factor receptors (TrkA, TrkB, TrkC and p 75 NTR) was detectable in human AVICs. Inhibition of Trk receptors markedly reduced the effects of NT 3 on Runx 2, TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2 production, <b>calcium</b> <b>deposit</b> formation and Akt phosphorylation. Further, inhibition of Akt also reduced the pro-osteogenic effects of NT 3. ConclusionsAVICs of diseased human aortic valves express higher levels of NT 3. NT 3 up-regulates the production of Runx 2, TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2, and promotes <b>calcium</b> <b>deposit</b> formation in human AVICs via the Trk–Akt pathway. Thus, NT 3 is a novel pro-osteogenic factor in aortic valves and {{may play a role}} in valvular calcification...|$|R

2500|$|Other {{infectious}} agents include cytomegalovirus, the {{herpes simplex}} virus, hyperthermia, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis. [...] Mother exposure to cytomegalovirus can cause microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, blindness, chorioretinitis (which can cause blindness), hepatosplenomegaly, and meningoencephalitis in fetuses. [...] Microcephaly is a disorder {{in which the}} fetus has an atypically small head, cerebral calcifications means {{certain areas of the}} brain have atypical <b>calcium</b> <b>deposits,</b> and meningoencephalitis is the enlargement of the brain.

The amygdala {{is thought to be}} involved in processing biologically relevant stimuli and in emotional long term memory, particularly those associated with fear, and both PET and MRI scans have shown a correlation between amygdala activation and episodic memory for strongly emotional stimuli. [...] Therefore, Urbach–Wiethe disease patients with calcifications and lesions in these regions may suffer impairments in these systems. These calcifications are the result of a buildup of <b>calcium</b> <b>deposits</b> in the blood vessels within this brain region. [...] Over time, these vessels harden and the tissue they are a part of dies, causing lesions. [...] The amount of calcification is often related to disease duration.
