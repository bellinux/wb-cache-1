25|$|Changing <b>cargo-handling</b> methods at the Port of Geelong left woolstores {{in inner}} Geelong unused, {{redevelopment}} {{beginning in the}} 1980s with the expansion of Westfield Geelong towards Corio Bay, and culminating in the Waterfront Geelong development. Gentrification of former working-class inner suburbs such as Geelong West, North Geelong, and South Geelong has also occurred. Today, the major residential growth corridors are north towards Lara, east towards Leopold, and south towards Mount Duneed as the Armstrong Creek Growth Area.|$|E
25|$|Able seamen and {{ordinary}} seamen operate the vessel and its deck equipment under officer supervision {{and keep their}} assigned areas in good order. They watch for other vessels and obstructions in the ship's path, {{as well as for}} navigational aids such as buoys and lighthouses. They also steer the ship, measure water depth in shallow water, and maintain and operate deck equipment such as lifeboats, anchors, and <b>cargo-handling</b> gear. On tankers, mariners designated as pumpmen hook up hoses, operate pumps, and clean tanks. When arriving at or leaving a dock, they handle the mooring lines. Seamen also perform routine maintenance chores, such as repairing lines, chipping rust, and painting and cleaning decks. On larger vessels, a boatswain — or head seaman — will supervise the work.|$|E
25|$|The KC-10 Extender first flew on 12 July 1980, {{but it was}} {{not until}} October the same year that the first aerial refuel sortie was performed. The design for the KC-10 {{involved}} modifications from the DC-10-30CF design. Unnecessary airline features were replaced by an improved <b>cargo-handling</b> system and military avionics. Meanwhile, the KC-10 retains 88% commonality with its commercial counterparts, giving it greater access to the worldwide commercial support system. Other changes from the DC-10-30CF include the removal of most windows and lower cargo doors. Early aircraft featured a distinctive light gray, white and blue paint scheme, but a gray-green camouflage scheme was used on later tankers. The paint scheme was switched to a medium gray color by the late 1990s.|$|E
25|$|The company first begun {{carrying}} {{passengers in}} 1962, {{when the car}} ferry MS Hansa Express opened a new service linking Hanko, Finland to Travemünde, Germany via Visby in Sweden. The ship {{was found to be}} too small from the start, and Hanko a poor choice for the Finnish terminus of the line. The route was altered to Helsinki–Kalmar–Travemünde in 1963, and two large new ferries were delivered for the route in 1966. MS Finnhansa was the larger of the two sister ships, surpassing MS Finnpartner by ten centimeters; it was the largest ferry in the Baltic Sea at the time. Having two ferries year-round proved to be unprofitable and the Finnpartner was sold in 1969. In the late 60s Finnlines developed the Finnflow <b>cargo-handling</b> system, which resulted in the building of the company's first RORO freighters MS Finncarrier, MS Hans Gutzeit and MS Finnfellow.|$|E
25|$|The Air Cargo Complex at the Chennai {{airport was}} {{established}} in 1978, when all regulatory and facilitating agencies were brought under one roof for faster processing/clearance of international cargo, to cater for air cargo movement in the southern region. At the cargo terminal, AAI functions as ground handling agency for airlines for handling or processing their cargo on ground and acts as custodian on behalf of customs import/export cargo under the customs act of 1962. Spread over an area of 19.5 acres, the complex uses <b>cargo-handling</b> equipments such as elevated transfer vehicle, forklifts, high-mast stackers, and power hydraulic pallet trucks for handling cargo. The covered area of the export wing of the complex is 20,595sqm while that of the import wing is 20,090sqm. The existing covered area of cargo terminal in occupation of AAI is 37,085sqm. There are three ETV build-up/working stations and 18 manual build-up ETV loading positions at the complex.|$|E

Airbus said on 12 May 2015, [...] "It is too early to know what impact [...] decision will have on the supply chain." [...] A400M MSN4 will be used to complete the development of new capabilities through the Standard Operating Clearances process; SOC1.5 will finalise aerial delivery, <b>cargo-handling</b> systems, self-defense systems, and air-to-air refueling using wing-mounted pods.|$|E
2500|$|On April 2, 1982, a PAL Boeing 747-200B {{arriving}} from San Francisco via Honolulu {{became the first}} aircraft to dock at the new 800-million peso Terminal 1 of Manila International Airport. PAL would later strengthen its <b>cargo-handling</b> capability by building a dedicated cargo terminal building adjacent to the MIA passenger terminal and installing cargo-refrigeration equipment in 1983. The new facilities, which catered mainly to international cargo services, enabled PAL to become a fully equipped cargo handler. Services to Paris and Zürich began in November 1982.|$|E
