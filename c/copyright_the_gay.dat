40|$|<b>The</b> <b>gay</b> gene {{was first}} {{identified}} in 1993 as {{a correlation between}} the genetic marker Xq 28 and <b>gay</b> male sexuality. <b>The</b> results of this original study were never replicated, and the biological reality of such an entity remains hypothetical. However, despite such tenuous provenance, <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> gene has persisted as a reference in science news, popular science writings, and in press releases and editorials about biomedical research. An examination {{of the life of}} <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> gene in U.

This article draws on an analysis of the U.

The consequent unmooring of <b>the</b> <b>gay</b> gene from accountability and accuracy demonstrates that the organization of biomedical databases could benefit from greater cross-disciplinary attention...|$|R
