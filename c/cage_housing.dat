The study concluded that [...] "the best evidence {{from a variety of}} sources suggests that (non-organic) non-cage systems incur costs of production that are at least 20 percent higher than the common <b>cage</b> <b>housing</b> systems". This is due to higher feed costs, higher hen laying mortality, higher direct housing costs, and higher labor costs. The study also estimated that almost the entire California egg industry would relocate to other states during the 5-year adjustment period. The study does not analyze implications for animal welfare. By demonstrating that most egg producers would leave the state, the report estimates that the initiative would not affect how eggs are produced, only where eggs are produced.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of metabolic <b>cage</b> <b>housing</b> on the Wistar rat physiological state and to analyze the correlation between the minerals in blood and urine. Thirty male rats were used in the experiment. Fifteen rats (control group) were housed individually in standard polycarbonate cages and fifteen rats (experimental group) in metabolic cages (Techniplast, Italy) for two weeks. Body weight, respiration rate, water and food consumptions were recorded for each animal at the beginning of the experiment. The same parameters, as well as blood and urine parameters of control and experimental animals were recorded during the experiment after 72 h, 168 h and 336 h of housing in standard cages and metabolic cages. Urine collection was measured only in the experimental group. Rats weight decreased from 3. 84 % to 18. 59 % (P< 0. 05), respiration rate from 18. 65 % to 24. 59 % (P< 0. 05) when rats were housed in metabolic cages. Consumption of food and water by the rat depended on how long the animal was kept in metabolic cage. Glucose concentration increased on average by 15. 37 %, WBC count decreased by 5. 83 % in the blood of rats housed in metabolic cages compared to the animals housed in standard cages. We did not observe significant changes of triglycerides concentration, red blood cells count and total protein between all rats. The positive moderate correlation of rat housing in a metabolic cage was between K blood and K urine, P blood and P urine, Na blood and K blood, between Na urine and P urine and significant negative moderate correlation was determined between K urine and P urine.

Forced swim tests were conducted {{to determine whether the}} animals experienced behavioral despair and the serotonergic integrity was tested using an 8 -OH-DPAT challenge. The metabolism <b>cage</b> <b>housed</b> mice excreted approximately tenfold higher amounts of corticosterone metabolites in feces throughout the study when compared to controls. Urinary biomarkers confirmed that these mice suffered from elevated levels of oxidative stress, and increased creatinine excretions indicated increased muscle catabolism. Changes in the core body temperature (stress-induced hyperthermia) and the fur state of the mice also indicated impaired well-being in the metabolism <b>cage</b> <b>housed</b> mice. However, monitoring body weight and feed intake was found misleading in assessing the wellbeing of mice over a longer time course, and the forced swim test was found poorly suited for studying chronic stress in mice in the present setup.

40|$|To {{comprehensively}} assess conventional vs. some alternative laying-hen housing systems under U. S. production conditions, a multi-institute and multi-disciplinary project, {{known as}} the Coalition for Sustainable Egg Supply (CSES) study, was carried out at a commercial egg production farm in the Midwestern United States over two single-cycle production flocks. The housing systems studied include a conventional <b>cage</b> <b>house</b> (200, 000 hen capacity), an aviary house (50, 000 hen capacity), and an enriched colony house (50, 000 hen capacity). As {{an integral part of}} the CSES project, continual environmental monitoring over a 27 -month period described in this paper quantifies indoor gaseous and particulate matter concentrations, thermal environment, and building ventilation rate of each house. Results showed that similar indoor thermal environments in all three houses were maintained through ventilation management and environmental control. Gaseous and particulate matter concentrations of the enriched colony house were comparable with those of the conventional <b>cage</b> <b>house.</b> In comparison, the aviary house had poorer indoor air quality, especially in wintertime, resulting from the presence of floor litter (higher ammonia levels) and hens’ activities (higher particulate matter levels) in it. Specifically, daily mean indoor ammonia concentrations had the 95 % confidence interval values of 3. 8 to 4. 2 (overall mean of 4. 0) ppm for the conventional cage house; 6. 2 to 7. 2 (overall mean of 6. 7) ppm for the aviary house; and 2. 7 to 3. 0 (overall mean of 2. 8) ppm for the enriched colony house. The 95 % confidence interval (overall mean) values of daily mean indoor carbon dioxide concentrations were 1997 to 2170 (2083) ppm for the conventional <b>cage</b> <b>house,</b> 2367 to 2582 (2475) ppm for the aviary house, and 2124 to 2309 (2216) ppm for the enriched colony house. Daily mean indoor methane concentrations were similar for all three houses, with 95 % confidence interval values of 11. 1 to 11. 9 (overall mean of 11. 5) ppm. The 95 % confidence interval values (overall mean) of daily mean PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations, in mg/m 3, were, respectively, 0. 57 to 0. 61 (0. 59) and 0. 033 to 0. 037 (0. 035) for the conventional <b>cage</b> <b>house,</b> 3. 61 to 4. 29 (3. 95) and 0. 374 to 0. 446 (0. 410) for the aviary house, and 0. 42 to 0. 46 (0. 44) and 0. 054 to 0. 059 (0. 056) for the enriched colony house.

In all housing systems, does had free access to an elevated platform. In the semi-group housing pens, four does were housed communally during 21 days of the reproduction cycle (to allow more space for locomotion and to increase opportunities for social contact), and individually during the other 21 days of the cycle (to minimize doe-doe and doe-kit aggression that peaks around kindling). In all, 24 Hycole does were included per system. The does entered the experiment at 203 days of age (after their first parity). The experiment consisted of four reproductive cycles, ending at 369 days of age. Pododermatitis was scored in cycles 1, 2 and 4. At {{the end of the}} 4 th cycle the does were euthanized and X-rays were taken to assess spinal deformation. Tibia and femur length, width and cortical thickness were determined and bone strength was assessed using a shear test, as a measure of bone quality. Although severe pododermatitis was absent, the prevalence of plantar hyperkeratosis (hair loss and callus formation) {{at the end of the}} 4 th cycle was much greater on the wire floor (65 % and 68 % for semi-group housing and individual cages, respectively) than on the plastic floor (5 %, P 0. 10), but in line with our expectations bone quality was affected favourably by semi-group housing.

40|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} {{are influenced by}} both environmental and genetic factors. A well-known example for gene x environment interactions in psychiatry is the low activity (s) allelic variant of the serotonin transporter (5 -HTT) promoter polymorphism (5 -HTTLPR) that {{in the context of}} stress increases risk for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Previously, we observed robust anxiety-related phenotypes, such as an impairment in fear extinction, in 5 -HTT knockout (5 -HTT 2 / 2) versus wild-type (5 -HTT+/+) rats housed in open cages. Recently, housing conditions were changed from open cages to individually ventilated cages (IVC), which are associated with a high ventilation fold and noise.

40|$|This study {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that hens that are reared in aviaries but produce in furnished cages experience poorer welfare in production than hens reared in caged systems. This hypothesis {{is based on the}} suggestion that the spatial restriction associated with the transfer from aviaries to cages results in frustration or stress for the aviary reared birds. To assess the difference in welfare between aviary and cage reared hens in production, non-beak trimmed white leghorn birds from both rearing backgrounds were filmed at a commercial farm that used furnished <b>cage</b> <b>housing.</b> The videos were taken at 19 and 21 weeks of age, following the birds ’ transition to the production environment at 16 weeks. Videos were analysed in terms of the performance of aversion-related behaviour in undisturbed birds, comfort behaviour in undisturbed birds, and alert behaviour directed to a novel object in the home cage. A decrease in the performance of the former behaviour and increase in the performance of the latter two behaviours indicates improved welfare. The results showed that aviary reared birds performed more alert behaviour near to the object than did cage reared birds at 19 but not at 21 weeks of age (P = 0. 03). Blood glucose concentrations did not differ between the treatments (P. 0. 10). There was a significant difference in mortality between treatments (P = 0. 000), with more death in aviary reared birds (5. 52 %) compared to cage birds (2. 48 %). The higher mortality of aviary-reared birds indicates a negative effect of aviary rearing on bird welfare, whereas the highe...|$|E

Average density normally lies between 15 and 18 rabbits/m 2. Increased interest in safeguarding animal welfare in livestock farming and the need to reduce intensive rabbit production costs have led in recent years to studying alternative housing to the classic cage. In this context, {{rabbit breeding}} in colonies could represent an interesting alternative to the classic cage. Colonial breeding and greater space availability appear to better satisfy the behavioural needs of rabbits and their welfare (Ferrante et al., 1997). In terms of production, however, the results appear discordant [...] ...|$|R
