500|$|The {{theme song}} for Homicide: Life on the Street was {{composed}} by Lynn F. Kowal, who submitted {{one of several}} tapes sent to the producers for consideration. Homicide producers initially had trouble finding the right song, and Levinson ultimately chose Kowal's themes because, {{while most of the}} candidates too closely resembled typical television theme songs, Levinson felt Kowal's song [...] "had that odd quality to it, drums or whatever, and it was very unusual". Music is presented in various ways throughout the first season of Homicide. Some songs are played on radios that play in the homicide squad room, like [...] "Lay Down My Life" [...] by Carole King, [...] "Texas Slide" [...] by Jean-Jacques Milteau, [...] "N.Y.C (<b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Believe</b> <b>This</b> City?)" [...] by Charles & Eddie, [...] "Little Boy Blues" [...] and [...] "Break Up" [...] by , and [...] "Tropic Call" [...] by Mitchell Coodley and Andrew Snitzer, all of which are featured in [...] "Night of the Dead Living". Other songs are more integrated into the show itself, like [...] "Hazy Shade of Blue", a Tor Hyams song that plays while the police raid several neighborhood homes in search of clues during [...] "Ghost of a Chance", and the hymn [...] "The Sweet By and By", which is sung at a church during Adena Watson's funeral in that same episode.

500|$|Producer and screenwriter David L. Paterson is the novel's author's son, and {{his name}} was {{featured}} on its dedication page. The story was based on his real life best friend, Lisa Hill, who was struck by lightning and killed {{when they were both}} eight years old. Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he could write a screenplay of the novel, and she agreed [...] "not only because he's [...] son, but also because he's a very good playwright". Paterson had difficulty marketing the screenplay, mostly because of Leslie's death; [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this,</b> I did meet with some companies that asked if I could just 'hurt' Leslie a little bit—put her in a light coma and then bring her out".|$|R
5000|$|In {{a review}} for Horror News, Jay Alan offered mild praise to the film, but concluded, [...] "If you’ve already seen the classic films of this slasher genre, you've {{laid eyes on}} the best there are to witness. This, nor does its {{original}} live up to them". While Digital Retribution's Devon Bertsch admitted that Bloody Murder 2 was better than its predecessor, he still referred to the film as [...] "lackluster" [...] and worthy of only a 2/5. Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict was {{highly critical of the}} film, writing, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> it, <b>this</b> tepid sequel is even worse—filled with stock horror characters, bad dialogue and even worse special effects, Bloody Murder 2 plays like a student film project gone horribly awry".|$|R

Seven years later, the now famous Hendrix would ask O'Day backstage at an arena concert in Texas, [...] "Pat, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>this</b> is happening?"
