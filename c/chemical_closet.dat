50|$|To {{enable the}} ROC {{to operate in}} a nuclear environment, changes were {{necessary}} to both centres and posts {{in order to provide}} protection against blast effects and radiation from nuclear bursts. It would also now be necessary for control centres and observation posts to be occupied for a period of between seven and twenty one days following any nuclear event. Between 1958 and 1968 a countrywide building programme resulted in a network of 1,563 underground monitoring posts, approximately eight miles apart, distributed throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, at an estimated cost of almost £5,000 each. The posts were excavated to a depth of twenty five feet, a monocoque reinforced concrete building was cast and bitumen tanked (or waterproofed), before the whole structure was covered by a compacted soil mound. Entry was facilitated by a steel ladder in a vertical shaft leading to a single room, providing accommodation for three observers to live and work, with a separate toilet compartment with <b>chemical</b> <b>closet.</b> Air was circulated from grilled ventilators {{at both ends of the}} post and electricity was provided by a crated 12 volt lead-acid battery, charged occasionally by a portable petrol electric generator. New instrumentation detected the peak overpressure from any nuclear burst, together with photographic indications of the burst location and size, plus resulting levels of radiation. Conditions in these spartan posts were cramped, cold, and in some cases damp. ROC centres were renamed as Controls and provided with bomb proof nuclear protected buildings. A small number of these were converted from suitable pre-existing Second World War anti-aircraft operations rooms (AAORs), with the remainder specially constructed as above ground or semi-sunk blockhouse buildings. These were constructed to a standard layout, dependent upon the subsoil composition at the construction site. Controls provided living and operational accommodation for up to a hundred observers and UKWMO warning teams. Included in the centre layout were male and female dormitories, kitchen and canteen provision, life support systems and decontamination facilities, a communications centre and a split level central operations room with balcony positions.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{to test the}} efficiency of <b>chemical</b> <b>closets</b> in treating excreta from typhoid carriers is described. The use of these closets kept a stream, which {{had in the past}} frequently contained Salmonella typhi, typhoid free for 24 months. Selenite broth as made in this laboratory, containing a final concentration of 0 · 8 % sodium hydrogen selenite when inoculated with the water sample, was significantly better than commercial selenite brilliant green enrichment broth for the recovery of S. typhi...|$|R
