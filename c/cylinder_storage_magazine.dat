40|$|The K- 25 Site UF{sub 6 } <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> yards {{are used}} for the {{temporary}} storage of UF{sub 6 } normal assay <b>cylinders</b> and long-term <b>storage</b> of other UF{sub 6 } cylinders. The K- 25 Site UF{sub 6 } <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> yards consist of six on-site areas: K- 1066 -B, K- 1066 -E, K- 1066 -F, K- 1066 -J, K- 1066 -K and K- 1066 -L. There are no permanent structures erected on the cylinder yards, except for five portable buildings. The operating contractor for the K- 25 Site is preparing a Safety Analysis Report (SAR) to examine the safety related aspects of the K- 25 Site UF{sub 6 } <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> yards. The SAR preparation encompasses many tasks terminating in consequence analysis {{for the release of}} gaseous and liquid UF{sub 6 }, one of which is the evaluation of natural phenomena threats, such as earthquakes, floods, and winds. In support of the SAR, the six active <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> yards were evaluated for vulnerabilities to natural phenomena, earthquakes, high winds and tornados, tornado-generated missiles, floods (local and regional), and lightning.

40|$|The Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS) is leased {{from the}} US Department of Energy (DOE) by the United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC), a {{government}} corporation formed in 1993. PORTS is in transition from regulation by DOE to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). One regulation is 10 CFR Part 76. 89, which requires that criticality alarm systems {{be provided for}} the site. PORTS originally installed criticality accident alarm systems in all building for which nuclear criticality accidents were credible. Currently, however, alarm systems are not installed in the enriched uranium hexafluoride (UF{sub 6 }) <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> lots. This report analyzes and documents {{the extent to which}} enriched UF{sub 6 } <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> lots at PORTS are covered by criticality detectors and alarms currently installed in adjacent buildings. Monte Carlo calculations are performed on simplified models of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> lots and adjacent buildings. The storage lots modelled are X- 745 B, X- 745 C, X 745 D, X- 745 E, and X- 745 F. The criticality detectors modelled are located in building X- 343, the building X- 344 A/X- 342 A complex, and portions of building X- 330. These criticality detectors are those located closest to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> lots. Results of this analysis indicate that the existing criticality detectors currently installed at PORTS are largely ineffective in detecting neutron radiation from criticality accidents in most of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> lots at PORTS, except sometimes along portions of their peripheries...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} Boyle's machine {{was invented by}} the British anaesthetist Henry Boyle (18751941) in 1917. Prior to this time, anaesthetists often carried all their equipment with them, but the development of heavy, bulky <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> and increasingly elaborate airway equipment meant that this was no longer practical for most circumstances. The anaesthetic machine is usually mounted on anti-static wheels for convenient transportation.|$|R
50|$|Compressors used to fill scuba {{cylinders}} {{have a high}} {{delivery pressure}} and may have a low delivery volume. They are used to fill diving <b>cylinders</b> and <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> or banks of <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders.</b> These compressors may be smaller and less powerful because the volume of gas they deliver is not so critical as it is not directly used by the diver; a lower volume compressor {{can be used to}} fill large <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> during the periods when demand is low. This stored compressed air can be decanted into diving cylinders when needed. Common scuba diving cylinder pressures are 200 bar (2940 psi), 3000 psi (207 bar), 232 bar (3400 psi) and 300 bar (4500 psi).|$|R
40|$|The tank {{capacity}} chart calibration problem of two oil tanks with deflection was studied, {{one of which}} is an elliptical <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> tank with two truncated ends and another is a <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> tank with two spherical crowns. Firstly, the function relation between oil reserve and oil height based on the integral method was precisely deduced, when the storage tank has longitudinal inclination but has no deflection. Secondly, the nonlinear optimization model which has both longitudinal inclination parameter α and lateral deflection parameter β was constructed, using cut-complement method and approximate treatment method. Then the deflection {{tank capacity}} chart calibration with a 10 [*]cm oil level height interval was worked out. Lastly, the tank capacity chart was corrected by BP neural network algorithm and got proportional error of theoretical and experimental measurements ranges from 0 % to 0. 00015 %. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method has better performance in terms of tank capacity chart calibration accuracy compared with other existing approaches and has a strongly practical significance...|$|R

50|$|As {{it is not}} {{possible}} to decant to a diving <b>cylinder</b> from a <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder</b> that holds gas at a lower pressure than the diving cylinder, the expensive gas in low pressure <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> is not easily consumed and may go to waste when the <b>storage</b> <b>cylinder</b> is returned to the supplier. The cascade system may be used with a bank of <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> to economically consume these high cost gases so that the economically maximum gas is used from the bank. This involves filling a diving cylinder by first decanting from the bank cylinder with the lowest pressure that is higher than the diving cylinder's pressure and then from the next higher-pressure bank cylinder in succession until the diving cylinder is full. The system maximizes the use of low-pressure bank gas and minimizes the use of high-pressure bank gas.|$|R
50|$|A cascade {{filling system}} is a high {{pressure}} gas <b>cylinder</b> <b>storage</b> system which {{is used for the}} refilling of smaller compressed gas cylinders. In some applications, each of the large cylinders is filled by a compressor, otherwise they may be filled remotely and replaced when the pressure is too low for effective transfer. The cascade system allows small cylinders to be filled without a compressor. In addition, a cascade system is useful as a reservoir to allow a low-capacity compressor to meet the demand of filling several small cylinders in close succession, with longer intermediate periods during which the <b>storage</b> <b>cylinders</b> can be recharged.|$|R
