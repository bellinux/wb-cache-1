40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the degree of <b>cervical</b> lengthening after <b>cerclage</b> and whether serial follow-up measurements of <b>cervical</b> length after <b>cerclage</b> are predictive of pregnancy outcome. Methods: Eighty women whose primary physician determined that a prophylactic (n = 50) or urgent cerclage (n = 30) was indicated had transvaginal ultrasonographic evaluation before and after cerclage. Thereafter, most women had three additional transvaginal ultrasound examinations until 32 weeks' gestation. At each examination, the mean of three measurements was calculated. Statistical analyses were done by t test, analysis of variance, and logistic regression, with significance set at P <. 05. Results: The mean +/- standard deviation precerclage cervical length was 27. 2 +/- 10. 3 mm and after cerclage was 34. 1 +/- 9. 9 mm (n = 80, P <. 001, paired t test). No significant association was found (r = - 0. 26) between the difference in cervical length (postcerclage - precerclage lengths) and pregnancy outcome. Patients with a prophylactic cerclage had a mean cervical length that was consistently longer in patients delivering at term compared with those who delivered preterm at 20 to 32 weeks' gestation. In the urgent cerclage group {{a significant difference in}} cervical length between those who delivered at term compared with preterm was evident only at 28 to 32 weeks. Conclusion: The increase in <b>cervical</b> length after <b>cerclage</b> is not predictive of term delivery. Serial cervical length measurements in the late second or early third trimester predict preterm birth but could provide earlier warning in patients with a prophylactic cerclage than in patients with urgent cerclage.

30|$|The {{prevention}} of preterm delivery {{rests on the}} recognition of the predisposing factors and the diagnosis of a preclinical stage. Transvaginal ultrasonography of the cervix may have a role in the prediction of the risk of early preterm delivery in both high- and low-risk women and deserves further rigorous testing to prove its value in clinical practice. A study in 2006 [18] showed that transvaginal ultrasonography in high-risk women could, independently, demonstrate shorter cervical lengths than in low-risk controls and similar lengths to women with previous spontaneous preterm birth and could predict preterm birth in women who have had LEEP. A cervical length of < 3.0  cm, further cervical shortening or opening of the cervix with uterine fundal pressure have all been suggested as predictive of preterm delivery or <b>cervical</b> incompetence requiring <b>cerclage</b> [19, 20]. A shortened cervical length in the mid-trimester may preferentially predict early, as opposed to later, spontaneous preterm birth in high-risk women [21]. Paradoxically, funnelling, as an independent finding, may not add appreciably to the risk of early gestational age at delivery associated with a shortened cervical length [19, 22]. A population-based prospective multi-centre study [23] provides a model that can give an accurate patient-specific risk of preterm delivery. It showed that the detection rate of screening by a combination of maternal factors and the measurement of cervical length was substantially higher than that of screening by each method alone.|$|R

Materials and methods: In a cohort of 2, 358 women with a second trimester miscarriage/delivery in first pregnancy and a subsequent delivery during 1997 – 2012, we reviewed {{a representative sample of}} 682 medical records. We searched for clinically important information and calculated positive predictive values of the registry diagnoses stratified by type of registry, as well as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and kappa coefficients of risk factors, pregnancy complications, and cerclage. Results: Miscarriage/spontaneous delivery in the second trimester was confirmed in 621 / 682 patients (91. 1 %). Pregnancy complications in second trimester miscarriages were underreported, resulting in low sensitivities and poor to moderate agreements between records and registries. There was a good agreement (kappa > 0. 6) between medical records and the registries regarding risk factors and cerclage. The diagnosis of cervical insufficiency had “moderate” kappa values for both miscarriages and deliveries (0. 55 and 0. 57). Conclusion: Spontaneous second trimester deliveries and miscarriages recorded in the registers were confirmed by medical records in 91 %, but register-based information on pregnancy complications need to be improved.

40|$|Preterm {{birth is}} {{a leading cause of}} {{neonatal}} morbidity and mortality. It is a major goal in obstetrics to lower the incidence of spontaneous preterm birth (SPB) and related neonatal morbidity and mortality. One of the principal objectives is to discover early markers that would allow us to identify subgroups of patients at high risk of SPB and, secondly, to manage those patients with an appropriate and effective strategy. The purpose of this thesis was to provide data on prediction of spontaneous preterm birth. The studies described in this thesis aim to evaluate (1) which predictive tests are appropriate to use to identify women at risk for SPB; (2) what factors influence the predictive value of a diagnostic test in general and of cervical length assessment in particular; and (3) what strategies are used regarding threatened SPB in the specific Dutch obstetric care. In chapter 2 we described the mechanisms contributing to SPB, which - mainly - have been identified during the past decade. SPB may result from one of the four primary pathogenic mechanisms, or from a combination: (1) activation of the maternal or fetal HPA axis; (2) inflammation (of ascending genital tract, systemic or chorion/decidual); (3) decidual hemorrhage and (4) pathologic distention of the uterus. The review {{in the second part of}} chapter 2 describes the usefulness of new biochemical fluid markers to identify women at risk for SPB. There are no current data to support the use of salivary estriol, home uterine monitoring and for other biochemical markers (e. g., corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), maternal serum ?-fetoprotein (MSAFP), interleukine- 6 (Il- 6) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)) larger studies are needed. In the general population no other risk factors than the obstetric history has proven to be effective. In the population at risk transvaginal ultrasonography to determine cervical length and fetal fibronectin testing, or a combination of both is likely to be useful in determining women at high risk for preterm labor. However, their clinical usefulness may rest primarily with their high negative predictive value, thereby avoiding unnecessary intervention. Only treatment with oral antibiotics of women with BV who are at risk for SPB has resulted in a reduction of SPB. Prophylactic treatment in women at risk for SPB, but without BV is not indicated. In chapter 3 we described a study regarding the usefulness of possible novel markers matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 1 and MMP- 9 in the prediction of SPB. MMP- 1 levels in cervicovaginal secretions were low and did not change during either preterm or term labor. MMP- 9 levels increased during term and preterm labor, with highest values in laboring patients with ruptured membranes, MMP- 9 is not a useful predictor of preterm birth, but does play an important role in membrane rupture. In chapter 4 and 5 we described the association of socio-demographic factors on the change of cervical length All women had a slight decrease of cervical length across gestation. Women who were African-American, under stress, or working as skilled manual laborers demonstrated significant shortening of the cervix during gestation. African-Americans delivered on average earlier (38. 4 weeks) than the other race groups. All pregnancies displayed progressive cervical shortening except Asians. African-American women had shorter cervices across all 3 gestational age intervals even after controlling for preterm delivery. It suggests that shortening of the cervix is particularly a risk indicator for preterm birth in African-American women, since they already have shorter cervices to begin with. Measuring cervical length before 25 weeks gestation might not be of substantial contribution to the prediction of preterm birth in other ethnical groups. In chapter 6 we evaluated the role of transvaginal ultrasonographic cervical length measurements for women with cervical incompetence. We determined that there was an increase in <b>cervical</b> length after <b>cerclage.</b> However, the degree of lengthening after cerclage was not predictive of term delivery. We alsoshowed that serial cervical length measurement in the late second or early third trimester predicted preterm birth. Since we were interested how predictors of SPB are implemented in the Dutch obstetric care. We developed a questionnaire to study opinions and management regarding threatened preterm birth, mutual co-operation and the VIL between first line obstetrical practitioners (midwives and general practitioners practicing obstetrics) and gynecologists (Chapter 7). There appeared to be consensus among the three professional groups about the way that risk selection takes place. In chapter 8 we assessed the use of modern diagnostic methods such as transvaginal sonographic measurements of cervical length, examination of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and fetal fibronectin (FFN) by Dutch gynecologists. Cervical length measurements are used by most of the Dutch gynecologists, even as testing and treating for BV. Fetal fibronectin testing - according to literature the best marker available now - is seldomly been used. Gynecologists in general hospitals without residency programs prescribe tocolytics and repeat corticosteroid treatment more often compared to the gynecologists in hospitals with residency programs. They prescribe less antibiotics for women with threatened preterm birth. Apparently 40 % of Dutch gynecologists treat preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) with tocolytics while there are no contractions. On some points the disciplines involved in obstetric care should adopt their guidelines to use the evidence from the literature. Use of FFN in the Dutch setting should be evaluated in the future...|$|R

30|$|<b>Cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> {{might be}} {{associated}} with reduced preterm labour and improved perinatal outcome in women with cervical changes detected by ultrasonography [24] and in certain high-risk group of women with recurrent late miscarriages [25]; however, other interventions might be contributory to the improved outcomes [26]. Early <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> {{does not appear to}} offer significant benefit over early transvaginal ultrasonography in women with unclear history of incompetent cervix [27]. There is uncertainty about the role of <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> for women who have a short cervix on ultrasound [24, 28, 29]; nonetheless, 62 % of the respondents would offer <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> to women with previous pregnancy loss, PROM, SROM or cervical length of less than 2  cm. It is noteworthy that some of those who disagree with the evidence still assess the cervix by ultrasonography and would offer cervical or transabdominal <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage.</b> More than half (56 %) of the respondents would offer <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> between 13 and 16  weeks gestation and 16 % extend the offer to 26  weeks. The end of the second trimester heralds the end of the natural foetal wastage; hence, choosing 13  weeks as the earliest time for the insertion of transvaginal cerclage is logical while the selection of 26  weeks as the latest cutoff time is probably influenced by advances in neonatal medicine and better neonatal survival rates achieved by many units in infants delivered at or beyond 26  weeks gestation. Although transabdominal <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> carries potentially higher morbidity [30], it may offer improved neonatal survival with lesser morbidity in carefully selected women [31 – 35] and performing the procedure preconceptionally might be a safer alternative [36]. Almost half of the respondents (48 %) agree with this assumption and would offer it to women who had excisional treatment, repeated treatments, second trimester loss, preterm labour or PROM, and this could be an over-representation of those who would actively intervene.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Data {{published}} {{from the}} United States {{have demonstrated that}} the use of <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> has fallen in the period 1998 – 2013. This is in contrast to recommendations in Australia. We examined this trend using data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). Study design: Retrospective population-based study. Methods: Data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare procedural database were used to determine the total number of <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> sutures inserted during the period 2004 to 2013. Population datasets were used to calculate age-stratified incidence rates of cerclage. Findings: There was {{a significant increase in the}} rate of <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> in women aged 25 to 34 years and in the 35 years and older age group. The incidence of preterm birth was stable for gestations of 32 to 36 weeks, but slightly increased in the 20 to 27 week and 28 to 31 week gestational age groups. Further research into <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> and the use of vaginal progesterone for the prevention of preterm birth would be valuable...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> is {{commonly}} {{performed by the}} obstetricians in cervical insufficiency. It can either be performed transvaginally or transabdominally. The laparoscopic approach needs more careful evaluation. In modern obstetric practice cerclage placement is indicated in three common conditions in singleton pregnancies. So far there is paucity of clinical trials, which can unquestionably demonstrate the advantages of <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> in comparison with a 'wait and see ' aptitude. Recent evidences suggest that vaginal progesterone or cerclage are equally efficacious {{in the prevention of}} preterm birth in women with a sonographic short cervix in the mid trimester, singleton gestation, and previous preterm birth. Selection of the optimal treatment needs to consider adverse events, cost and patient/clinician preferences. Key words: <b>Cervical</b> <b>cerclage,</b> McDonald cerclage, Shirodkar cerclag...|$|E
40|$|<b>Cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> {{remains a}} proven method for the {{prevention}} of preterm birth caused by a ‘weak cervix’. However, there is controversy as regards the precise diagnosis and definition of ‘cervical incompetence’, the actual surgical technique, choice of suture material and number of sutures and ties to be made during the procedure. There is now emerging evidence that other alternatives to <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> such as the cervicalpessary and progesterone therapy may have a role in the prevention of preterm birth. These could eliminate the exposure of patients to risks associated with surgical interventions. This short commentary presents an update on the role of <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> in the prevention of preterm birth and explores the available evidence on the alternatives to the procedure...|$|E
30|$|Introduction: The {{numerous}} {{methods are}} presently {{used for the}} surgical treatment of cervical incompetence. For many years the traditional treatment of this condition has been the transvaginal <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage.</b> But this procedure is ineffective {{in the number of}} cases due to the technical difficulties of putting stitches on the uterine cervix, the development of the ascending infection etc. Here we describe our first case of the laparoscopic <b>cervical</b> <b>cerclage</b> in a patient with recurrent miscarriage.|$|E
