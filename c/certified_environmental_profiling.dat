40|$|The {{focus of}} our {{empirical}} {{study was to determine}} whether a short laboratory-based intervention manipulating the self-nature relation through a new construct of environmental problem salience is capable of causing a situational change in implicit and explicit attitudes towards nature. We were interested in how the self would connect itself to the state of nature portrayed as a threatening problem for which the self is possibly responsible. The participants were divided into two groups based on their <b>environmental</b> <b>profiles</b> and exposed to a video clip which implied a global environmental problem. The study treatment was designed to make the environmental problem salient. We have observed a clear effect of the field of study, yet the sample size (N= 77) was not sufficient for the treatment effect to be statistically significant. Our study brings mainly preliminary result and further and more robust research is needed. We observed a slight change in attitudes. The attitudes had divergent directions according to the <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> of the recipient. The results suggest that the participants with a low <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> more deeply perceived the problem as someone else’s problem and dissociated themselves from the nature framed by the treatment, while the participants with a high <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> accepted the problem and associated themselves with the nature framed by the treatment. Our findings are in agreement with the critique of the apocalyptical discursive pattern, which considers planned change of environmental policy with apocalyptical discursive pattern to be ineffective...|$|R
40|$|Thin film {{technologies}} undergo rapid developments {{for increasing}} the module efficiencies and improving production technologies or recycling processes which affect the <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> of PV power generation and Energy Payback Time (EPBT). Therefore, especially for the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of product systems with short development cycles, the <b>environmental</b> <b>profiles</b> need to be frequently updated to ensure the representativeness {{and validity of the}} environmental assessment. The update of LCA results in this paper demonstrates that considerable improvements were reached in the <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> of CdTe PV power and EPBT over the last four years. Depending on the location of installation in Europe, the corresponding Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of PV power for ground mounted power plants are between 19 and 30 ?g CO 2 -equiv. /kWh and between 0. 7 and 1. 1 years in terms of EBPT.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the {{construction}} sector has focused strongly on reducing operational energy consumption. Other types of environmental impact that occur {{during the life}} span of construction works, however, have {{to be taken into account}} as well. This case study focuses on developing scenarios to improve the <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> of new buildings in the Flemish/Belgian context. The study takes into account current energy regulation and investigates the influence of energy scenarios and building type on the <b>environmental</b> <b>profile.</b> A life cycle energy assessment (LCEA) and a life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) were carried out for all scenarios, supplemented by a screening life cycle costing (LCC). The results indicate the importance of the compactness of a building, with the best results identified for the terraced scenario. The results are due to the reduced use of materials and, to a smaller extent, a reduction in energy consumption (smaller exposed surface). The results of the energy scenarios show a discrepancy between the LCEA and LCIA. According to the LCEA, passive scenarios are always preferable, but the LCIA results suggest two ways to reach a similar <b>environmental</b> <b>profile.</b> Firstly, by providing a level of insulation based on current regulations complemented with advanced technical services, and, alternatively, by increasing the level of insulation along with standard services. The results of the LCC show a similar trend to those of the LCIA. The results therefore suggest that there are multiple ways to improve the <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> of new buildings. Nevertheless, the choice of impact assessment method can have a strong influence on the results...|$|R
40|$|Potato sprout inhibitors are {{generally}} applied to suppress sprouting during winter storage. This study presents the compared <b>environmental</b> <b>profiles</b> {{of the two}} sprout inhibitors available on the Dutch market: A traditional chemical product with isopropyl- 3 -chlorophenylcarbamate (CIPC) and isopropyl-phenylcarbamate (IPC) and a new agrification product with S-(+) -carvone derived from caraway seed (Carum carvi), examining the common idea that natural products are less harmful to the environment than chemical products. Nine environmental effect scores are evaluated based on emissions and energy use during the entire life cycle (life cycle analysis, LCA). A substantial difference {{is found in the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>profiles</b> of the two sprout inhibitors. In seven environmental effects (C) IPC scores better than carvone. Carvone only scores better with regard to human toxicity and ozone depletion. This study has also produced a clear insight into the relevant factors in the life cycles determining the <b>environmental</b> <b>profiles.</b> Regarding carvone, the essential factors are the use of fertilizer in the cultivation of caraway and the relatively high amount of carvone used per ton of potatoes as compared to (C) IPC. It is recommended that environmental LCA's be performed for other agrification products. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} much {{attention}} has been paid to firms’ <b>environmental</b> <b>profile.</b> Implementing and improving firm’s <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> are twofold. First, launching the environmental governance is a foundation for firm’s <b>environmental</b> <b>profile.</b> Second, the characteristics of board of directors directly affect the decisions made by board on all firm’s performance. Drawing on the resource-dependence theory and agency theory, board characteristics represent board resource-provision role and board monitoring role. This paper aims to understand how the board monitoring and board resource-provision roles influence firm’s environmental governance for 267 US firms from 2010 to 2012. The findings confirm that effective boards increase their monitoring of management when there are more independent directors on the board, higher CEO–chairman duality, higher share ownership for insiders and the CEO and finally lower share ownership for outsider–directors. Boards with strong social network connections, larger board size and lower board tenure are classified as resource-rich boards. The results also confirm that resource-rich boards with effective monitoring roles tend to have a board, or a committee appointed by the board that is responsible for environmental initiatives, paying incentives for the management of climate change issues, publishing information in annual reports, voluntary communications and other regulatory filings...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} corporate greening in general, {{and specifically}} the environmental technology (ET) sector as a green sector. The thesis has also particular focus on production and products related aspects {{and the influence}} of the <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> of the ET sector on the environmental engagement of companies in the sector. The study is based on a questionnaire-based survey, online surveys and on semi-structured open-ended interviews. The organizations within the ET sector were identified using existing platforms within this sector: Sustainability Sweden and Swentec. The results show that not all companies and industry associations in the ET sector clearly distinguish between product and production related environmental aspects. Furthermore, the product related <b>environmental</b> <b>profile,</b> which constitutes the legitimacy for the sector, can influence companies’ environmental strategy, not only positively but also negatively. The results from the survey on Global Supersector Leaders 2009 / 2010 in Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI) show that all companies are aware of production and product related environmental issues. Based on results from this survey a model of corporate <b>environmental</b> <b>profile</b> consisting of product and production oriented activities as well as initiatives that go beyond the core business operations is proposed. These initiatives can be divided into two groups: environmental education and environmental projects and sponsorship. This thesis proposes products and production related impacts and environmental activities as bases for defining corporate <b>environmental</b> <b>profiles,</b> corporate greening, and for defining ‘green’ and ‘green-green’ business as well as environmental leaders. The distinction between product and production related environmental initiatives {{as well as the other}} dimensions of the proposed model in this thesis can support companies in their communication of environmental performance and environmental activities.  Furthermore, ‘competitive advantage’, ‘environmental responsibility’ and ‘environmental leadership’ should motivate companies within the ET sector to be ‘vocal’ green-green firms...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{a unique}} firm level data {{set of the}} German {{manufacturing}} sector, this paper provides new empirical evidence regarding the determinants {{of different types of}} environmental technological innovations. We examine particularly the effects of environmental organizational measures such as <b>certified</b> <b>environmental</b> management systems. The econometric analysis is based on binary and multinomial discrete choice models. The latter are considered because they allow for the examination of the determinants of specific types of environmental innovations compared with the absence of such innovations as basic alternative. The most important result is that single measures such as product design with life cycle analysis and take back systems for products have a significantly strong positive effect on environmental product and process innovations. In contrast, the effects of <b>certified</b> <b>environmental</b> management systems are statistically less reliable. While the world-wide ISO 14001 standard has a significantly weak positive influence, the European EMAS standard has no significant effect on environmental innovations at all. A certification with {{at least one of these}} standards has a significantly positive effect on both the realization of an environmental product and a process innovation, indeed only compared with the realization of no environmental innovation.
