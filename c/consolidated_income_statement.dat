Focusing on relatively small businesses, this study finds that income-statement conservatism, measured as timely loss recognition, is increasing in a firm's bank dependence. This study also finds that the value relevance of the <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> is increasing in a firm's bank dependence. The findings of this paper suggest that the usefulness of the <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> varies with a firm's bank dependence, indicating that the value relevance of the <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> is a function of a firm's debt financing decision. The findings further suggest that bank relationships affect the value relevance of the <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> through their influence on income-statement conservatism.

40|$|The {{vertical}} <b>income</b> <b>statement,</b> {{which is}} one of the main <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> of accounting, is accepted all across the world. Nevertheless, this vertical form is not compatible with the principles of the double-entry accounting system. The first usage of the vertical <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> came about in the second half of the 19 th century. The emergence of managerial accounting occurred at the same period. In the years of the First World War (1914 - 1918), banks were not only examining the balance sheets of risky customers before lending credits, they were also bringing to the fore, the relationship between profits and sales. As a result of this, vertical <b>income</b> <b>statements</b> started to be applied. In the beginning, the vertical <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> was based on an arrangement of sales to gross margin from the top to the bottom. This system developed during the 20 th century to give us its current form today. During this development period, the vertical <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> advanced alongside managerial accounting. This was because the vertical <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> system was compatible with financial analysis techniques. It was the 20 th century in which both managerial accounting and the vertical <b>income</b> <b>statement</b> finished their globalization of the world. Unfortunately, there has not been any discussion on the side-effects of this process to the principles of the double-entry accounting system...|$|R
