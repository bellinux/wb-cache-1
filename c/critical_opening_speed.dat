40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{aimed to}} investigate, {{by means of}} finite element analysis, {{the effect of a}} drill hole {{at the end of a}} {{horizontal}} osteotomy to reduce the risk of lateral cortex fracture while performing an opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO). The question was whether drilling a hole relieves stress and increases the maximum correction angle without fracture of the lateral cortex depending on the ductility of the cortical bone. METHODS: Two different types of osteotomy cuts were considered; one with a drill hole (diameter 5 mm) and the other without the hole. The drill holes were located about 20 mm distally to the tibial plateau and 6 mm medially to the lateral cortex, such that the minimal thickness of the contralateral cortical bone was 5 mm. Based on finite element calculations, two approaches were used to compare the two types of osteotomy cuts considered: (1) Assessing the static strength using local stresses following the idea of the FKM-guideline, subsequently referred to as the "FKM approach" and (2) limiting the total strain during the opening of the osteotomy wedge, subsequently referred to as "strain approach". A <b>critical</b> <b>opening</b> angle leading to crack initiation in the opposite lateral cortex was determined for each approach and was defined as comparative parameter. The relation to bone aging was investigated by considering the material parameters of cortical bones from young and old subjects. RESULTS: The maximum equivalent (von-Mises) stress was smaller for the cases with a drill hole at the end of the osteotomy cut. The critical angle was approximately 1. 5 times higher for the specimens with a drill hole compared to those without. This corresponds to an average increase of 50 %. The calculated critical angle for all approaches is below 5 °. The critical angle depends on the used approach, on patient's age and assumed ductility of the cortical bone. CONCLUSIONS: Drilling a hole at the end of the osteotomy reduces the stresses in the lateral cortex and increases the <b>critical</b> <b>opening</b> angle prior to cracking of the opposite cortex in specimen with small correction angles. But the difference from having a drill hole or not is not so significant, especially for older patients. The ductility of the cortical bone is the decisive parameter for the <b>critical</b> <b>opening</b> angle...|$|R

With this interrupting principle it is possible, during high-current interruptions, to increase by about 30% the tripping energy delivered by the operating mechanism and to maintain the <b>opening</b> <b>speed</b> independently of the current.

40|$|Lung {{recruitment}} and derecruitment {{contribute significantly to}} variations in the elastance of the respiratory system during mechanical ventilation. However, the decreases in elastance that occur with deep inflation are transient, especially in acute lung injury. Bates and Irvin (8) proposed {{a model of the}} lung that recreates time-varying changes in elastance as a result of progressive {{recruitment and}} derecruitment of lung units. The model is characterized by distributions of <b>critical</b> <b>opening</b> and closing pressures throughout the lung and by distributions of speeds with which the processes of opening and closing take place once the critical pressures have been achieved. In the present study, we adapted this model to represent a mechanically ventilated mouse. We fit the model to data collected in a previous study from control mice and mice in various stages of acid-induced acute lung injury (3). Excellent fits to the data were obtained when the normally distributed <b>critical</b> <b>opening</b> pressures were about 5 cmH 2 O above the closing pressures and when the hyperbolically distributed opening velocities were about an order of magnitude greater than the closing velocities. We also found that, compared with controls, the injured mice had markedly increased opening and closing pressures but no change in the velocities, suggesting that the key biophysical change wrought by acid injury is dysfunction of surface tension at the air-liquid interface. Our computational model of lung recruitment and derecruitment dynamics is thus capable of accurately mimicking data from mice with acute lung injury and may provide insight into the altered biophysics of the injured lung...|$|R
