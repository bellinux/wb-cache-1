40|$|Focusing on the Swedish {{census of}} 1900, the <b>child-woman</b> <b>ratio</b> and own-children method {{have been applied}} to assess {{socioeconomic}} differences in fertility. These indirect estimates of fertility have been compared to the vital statistics {{at the national level}} to assess their reliability. This comparison demonstrated that the estimated results suffered from few errors. Even if these indirect estimates of fertility could be affected by possible socioeconomic differences in mortality, the tests show that at least in the Swedish case, the impact of mortality on the indirect measures is limited. As infant mortality differences by socioeconomic status are relatively small, indirect fertility estimates are mainly affected by differences in reproductive behavior...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{comparative}} demographic {{study used}} household-level manuscript census data to explore ethnic, occupational, and rural-urban differences in fertili-ty. The study region comprised two western Massachusetts counties which ex-perienced industrialization, urbanization, and immigration throughout the nine-teenth century. We collected one-in-ten samples of households {{from the federal}} manuscript censuses of fifteen communities. We sampled the same communities in 1850 and 1880, and coded detailed characteristics of over 2, 400 households. In addition to {{counting the number of}} preteenage children in each household, we used information on the ages of women and children to estimate the length of the childbearing span. In so doing, we could refine the <b>child-woman</b> <b>ratio</b> by stan-dardizing it according to the number of years a currently married woman had been at risk of bearing a child-since age 25 or since the birth of her first child. We then employed age standardization and multiple classification analysis in an attempt to rule out competing explanations of native-immigrant differences.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{systematic}} micro demographic {{study with}} {{special emphasis on}} sex-ratio (Female- Male ratio or FMR) patterns among the Santals in nineteen villages of the bordering districts of the states of West Bengal and Jharkhand comprises 2257 male and 2135 female individuals. Sex-ratio patterns among the Santals exhibit low FMR (946), compared to the all-India FMRST, 972 (Census of India, 1991). However, the average FMR (946) of the Santals in this area, {{has been found to}} be little higher than the average FMRST (941 in Census of India, 1991) of these two neighbouring states. Santals of Jharkhand also show higher FMR (964) in comparison with those of West Bengal (935). FMR of all age goups among the Santals in Jharkhand exceed the FMR of the Santals in West Bengal, except that in the age-group of 10 - 14 years. In both the states, a decline of FMR 59 from FMR 04 indicates a trend of excess girl-child mortality among the Santals. However, a decadal increment of FMR among the Santals in this region is observed from the higher value of FMR 0 - 9 than FMR 10 - 19. Substantial female labour participation (FLP) is reflected from FMR 15 - 44 and FMR 15 - 64 among the Santals, especially those of Jharkhand. Further, percentage of persons (0 - 4 years and 0 - 14 years), work-participation rate and age-dependency ratio are found to be higher among the Santals of Jharkhand. In contrast, <b>child-woman</b> <b>ratio</b> and percentage of old-age population among the Santals of West Bengal are recorded as higher than the Santals of Jharkhand...|$|E
40|$|Background Many African {{countries}} {{experience a}} protracted epidemiologic transition, {{different from the}} classical transition in western societies. The factors driving this protracted transition are largely unknown. In northeast Ghana, we studied an ongoing epidemiologic transition and investigated the effects of socioeconomic status and drinking water source on the transition. Methods During a 9 -year period, we followed a cohort of almost 30 000 individuals and collected information on mortality and fertility rates. In addition, using the standards set out by the WHO, we obtained the causes of death by verbal autopsy. Individuals were stratified according to their socioeconomic status and the households' use of an improved or unimproved drinking water source. Results Mortality rates decreased by − 5. 0 % annually (p< 0. 001) and {{the main cause of}} death shifted from infectious to non-infectious diseases (p= 0. 014). General fertility rates and <b>child-women</b> <b>ratios</b> decreased annually by − 12. 7 % (p< 0. 001) and − 11. 9 % (p< 0. 001), respectively. There was no difference in the decline of mortality and fertility depending on socioeconomic status or drinking water source...|$|R
40|$|Fertility {{across and}} within {{countries}} {{is influenced by}} a number of socio-economic and cultural factors, including ethnicity and potentially religion. However, apart from census data, little information is available, at least in the UK, to estimate fertility rates and thus fertility trends by ethnic and religious groups between censuses. Previously, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) has been exploited to produce national total fertility rates (TFR) by ethnic groups up to 2001 using the reverse-survival Own-Children Method (OCM). Here the LFS-OCM is assessed and refined to improve accuracy and tested against official statistics. The LFS-OCM is compared with results obtained using more straightforward techniques based on <b>Child-Women</b> <b>Ratios</b> using the same LFS data, and differences are discussed. The refined method is applied to produced recent fertility profiles by ethnic groups, including trends in the TFR and age-specific fertility rates, showing significant and decreasing differences between groups. Furthermore, the method allows us to reliably investigate TFR within one ethnic group by other criteria, as illustrated by differences in the TFR by religious affiliation of Indian women.

40|$|Background : Although demographers {{have long}} been {{interested}} in studying the historical fertility transition, {{there is still a}} lack of knowledge about disaggregated patterns. Identifying these patterns could help us to better understand the mechanisms behind the transition. Objective : The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore social class differentials in fertility before, during, and after the fertility decline, in order to test hypotheses regarding a reversal of class differences during the transition. Methods : We use micro-level census data for Sweden 1880, 1890, 1900, 1960, and 1970 with individual-level information on occupation, which is used to measure class. Poisson regressions with parish-level fixed effects enable us to carefully control spatial heterogeneity in measuring class differences in net fertility (<b>child-woman</b> <b>ratios).</b> Results : The relative differences were about as large in the early phases of the transition as they were in the 1960 s. The fertility levels of the high-fertility classes were about 40 Š higher than those of the low-fertility classes. In the early phases of the decline, the upper and middle classes had much lower net fertility than lower skilled workers, who had the highest fertility levels. However, there was no clear gradient from the highest to the lowest socioeconomic status. Instead, it appears that the upper and middle classes had low fertility levels, while the fertility levels of the remaining groups were unchanged, and therefore remained relatively high. In the 1960 s, members of the middle class had the lowest fertility levels, while farmers and rural laborers had the highest fertility levels. Conclusions : The results only partly confirm the assumption that there was a reversal in class differences in the demographic transition. Class was found to be important, but the pattern was not characterized by a simple gradient. Moreover, spatial heterogeneity was shown to explain about half of the observed differences between classes. The observed pattern suggests that the fertility transition can be attributed to both innovation-diffusion and the adjustment to new socioeconomic conditions...|$|R
40|$|This article covers {{contemporary}} {{issues of}} Russia’s population reproduction, their causes {{and the state}} policy aimed to overcome the same. The urgency to fulfill the task related to assessment of the most probable future dynamics of Russia’s population birth rate {{in the context of}} a low <b>child-woman</b> <b>ratio,</b> and subject to an impact of pronatalist policies implemented by the state, is justified. In order to fulfill the task based on the crude birth rate behavior probability distribution function, a probabilistic assessment of future dynamics of Russia’s population reproduction has been carried out. Based on a modernized method suggested by Hurst, the following two forecasting paths of the crude birth rate dynamics have been built: the first path conforms to the scenario where a value of the crude birth rate is to tend to values between 8 – 10. 5 births/ 1, 000 people (probability is 0. 182), in particular, through a negative external impact, the second path is to tend to values between 13 – 16. 5 births/ 1, 000 people (probability — 0. 618), in particular, through a positive external impact. Notwithstanding that these scenarios significantly differ from each other, the paths of the crude birth rate dynamics for 2015 – 2041, corresponding to the reliable prediction time, forecasted according to the abovementioned scenarios, are virtually identical. The analysis of the findings allowed for the conclusion that the state demographic policy is not capable of having a significant impact on the future dynamics of the birth rate, substantially determined by the current situation and conjuncture shifts. These conclusions confirm the view prevailing in academic circles and suggesting that the state regulation of Russia’s demographic situation should be primarily focused on the improvement in health and a rise in the life expectancy of the population. The research has been prepared with the support of the Russian Science Foundation grant (Project No. 14 - 18 - 00574 “Information and analytic systems “Anticrisis”: diagnostics of the regions, threat evaluation and scenario forecasting to preserve and reinforce the welfare of Russia”) ...|$|E
