A gesture that I appreciate and I’ll try to give back narrating some facts of the first century of our independence. The story starts a few decades before 1810, especially with {{the institution of the}} Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, and ends at 1880, when indigenous peoples are submited, traditional estate, the gaucho gerrillas and the last caudillos (the pattern and the National Guards pawns) are extinguished, agriculture and industry develops, the railroad replaces the wagons, is mass immigration and techniques of exploitation of natural resources strengthens social and economic structure, policy that starts the National Organization bequeathed to us Eighty generation. Two figures are presented as conclusion and synthesis of this period and serve as a bridge that starts from 1880 : Francisco Javier Muñiz and Manuel Augusto Montes de Oca. The first such example of a surgeon in the wars of independence, internal frontier garrisons, the vicissitudes of the early university studies and creative work in the solitude of the peoples of campaign not only providing a commendable assistance but researching and discovering the first indigenous smallpox vaccine, rectifying errors jennerianos concept of <b>cows</b> <b>pox</b> disease of horses were infected, combating epidemics and initiating scientific research, natural sciences and producing valued communications throughout the world, {{as in the case of}} Darwin himself, who makes the research Muñiz as one of the foundations of his theory of evolution of species.

He gather in his person a more advanced knowledge and understanding of their subject, son of exile and disagreements before the national organization, contact to Europe, but attached to the reality of their land, teaches its students to follow their own observations and experiences at the patient bedside.

40|$|Abstract Leather plays a {{vital role}} in earning the foreign {{currency}} for Bangladesh. Export of finished leather and leather products have an important impact on the economy of Bangladesh. Mainly cow goat sheep and buffalo leathers are produced in this country. Different defects of leather due to numerous numbers of diseases of animals of poor management of people deteriorate the quality of leather which has negative impact in this sector. This paper analyses the magnitude and category of major defects in case of cow goat and buffalo of Bangladesh. We have studied in sixteen tanneries of Hazaribagh Dhaka where 95 tanneries of the whole country are situated. This study found that in case of cow skin hair slip parasitic skin diseases wound and pox are mainly responsible for the defects in leather in raw condition. Again in case of the wet blue leather of <b>cow</b> flay cut <b>pox</b> mark parasitic diseases growth mark wound sun burn scratch dark mole are responsible for the defects. Further for crust leather of cow flay cut parasitic diseases pox looseness for bating scratch wrinkle grain damage are found as the reason of defects. In case of goat parasitic diseases pox growth mark mole scratch flay cut hair slip were found responsible mostly for the defects in Bangladesh. Moreover parasite pox wound branding growth mark wrinkle jam wrinkle mole scratch flay cut curing have been detected for the defects of buffalo in this country. Again in this study it is found that average leather grade A-D is 15 E-F is 25 G-H is 30 HH is 12. 5 and again the rejection is 18. 43. It is observed that most of the defects occur during animal life period. The rest of the defects happen during slaughter flaying preservation and processing period of hides and skins into leather. By proper caring of the farm level and at the point of slaughter and flaying desired quality of hides and skins could be obtained...|$|R

5000|$|With {{the support}} of his older brothers, John Dix Fisher entered Brown University, graduating in 1820. After {{receiving}} his M.D. degree in 1825 from what was then called Massachusetts Medical College of Harvard University, he immediately accompanied his brother, the artist Alvan Fisher, on a trip to Europe. In Paris, he pursued his professional studies with such eminent physicians of the period as René Laennec, inventor of the stethoscope; Gabriel Andral, distinguished pathologist; and Alfred Velpeau, renowned for his knowledge of surgical anatomy. In medical school, Dr. Fisher had studied with Dr. James Jackson, Harvard's first professor of clinical medicine and one of the [...] "fathers" [...] of Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Jackson had touched on the difficulties of distinguishing smallpox from other eruptive diseases and the need for a series of colored pictures which would illustrate the progress of the disease. Dr. Fisher undertook such a project while in Paris and wrote Description of the Distinct, Confluent, and Inoculated Small Pox, Varioloid Disease, <b>Cow</b> <b>Pox,</b> and Chicken Pox (1829) which included thirteen colored plates. The paintings from which the plates were made were executed under Dr. Fisher's direction by a French artist working at the bedside of the patients during 1825 and 1826 when smallpox was an epidemic in Paris.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the population at the time accepted the up and coming vaccination. However, there were still opposition from individuals who were reluctant to change from the inoculations. In addition, there became a growing concern from parties who were worried about the unknown repercussions of infecting a human with an animal disease. One way individuals expressed their discontent was to draw comics that sometimes depicted small cows growing from the sites of vaccination. Others publicly advocated for the continuance of the inoculations; however this was not because of their discontent for the vaccinations. Some of their reluctance had to do with an apprehensiveness for change. They had become so familiar with the process, outcome, positives, and negatives of inoculations that {{they did not want to}} be surprised by the outcome or effects of the vaccinations. Jenner soon eased their minds after extensive trials. However, others advocated against vaccinations for different reason. Because of the high price of inoculation, Jenner experienced very few common folk who were not willing to accept the vaccination. Due to this, Jenner found many subjects for his tests. He was able to publish his results in a pamphlet in 1798: An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of Variolae Vaccinae, a Disease, Discovered in some of the Western Counties of England particularly Gloucestershire, and known by the Name of <b>Cow</b> <b>Pox.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Diseases {{caused by}} pox viruses, {{especially}} smallpox, {{have been known}} about for centuries. One of the earliest suspected cases is that of Egyptian pharaoh Ramses V who {{is thought to have}} died from smallpox circa 1150 years BCE. [...] Smallpox was thought to have been transferred to Europe around the early 8th century and then to the Americas in the early 16th century. It is widely accepted that the main defeat of the Aztecs was due to a smallpox epidemic and within two years over 3.2 million Aztecs died. This death toll {{can be attributed to the}} American population's complete lack of exposure to the virus over millennia. A century after Edward Jenner showed that the less potent <b>cow</b> <b>pox</b> could be used to effectively vaccinate against the more deadly smallpox, a worldwide effort to vaccinate everyone against smallpox began with the ultimate goal to rid the world of the plague-like epidemic. The last case of endemic smallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977. Extensive searches over two years detected no further cases, and in 1979 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease officially eradicated. In 1986, all virus samples were destroyed or transferred to two approved WHO reference labs: at the headquarters of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the C.D.C.) in Atlanta, Georgia (the United States) and at the Institute of Virus Preparations in Moscow. Post September 11, 2001 the American and UK governments have had increased concern over the use of smallpox, or a smallpox like disease, in bio-terrorism.|$|E

It is important to recall that people were still being bled at the time, to relieve the presence of evil humors.

40|$|Project (M. S. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Emphasis in American History, 2005. To {{inoculate}} or vaccinate: {{that has}} been the question regarding the threat of smallpox. The scourge of smallpox has plagued mankind for centuries. Its effects, upon arrival in the New World, if anything, were magnified, especially among the native populations. Yet, even among the flood of northern European pioneers, pilgrims, and paupers, periodic smallpox epidemics decimated the population. The introduction of the inoculation from the Middle East in the early eighteenth century offered a respite, if not a solution, to the terror. However, while the inoculation proceedure resulted in a yet-unexplained less virulent form of smallpox and granted life-long immunity, it also killed about one per cent of its patients and could still transmit the disease to others. Because of its danger and required quarantine period, smallpox continued its rampage. During the American Revolution, the impact of a North American pandemic created a crises for both Rebels and Loyalists. Washington, a smallpox survivor himself, struggled to create an army while the pox snuffed his ranks. Indeed, smallpox and winter combined to stop an American drive on Quebec. African-American slaves who answered the call of Virginia???s governor to win their freedom were cut as if by grape shot by the smallpox virus. Edward Jenner???s discovery in 1796 that a <b>cow</b> <b>pox</b> vaccination proved pivotal in the battle against smallpox, although it did not provide lifetime immunity as he initially claimed. Because it too was not risk free, the debate over its use raged on until the scourge was declared eradicated in 1980. 5 This study will trace the inoculation and vaccination controversy from the eighteenth century through the present, examining the risks versus rewards each has presented in turn to the populations involved. The contentious debates that swirled around the religious, social, economic, and medical reasons to inoculate and later, vaccinate, in eighteenth through the twentieth century, will be addressed and viewed in the light of recent events involving the threatened use of bioterror weapons like smallpox in a country once again virtually defenseless against such a scourge. Within the classroom, students will read and examine historical documents, maps, letters, photographs, drawings, and charts to: 1. Understand that some things change in the course of history and some things do not. 2. Understand the impact of smallpox as well as its cure in America history. 3. Understand that smallpox is also an issue today with potential consequences as grave as those in colonial times...|$|E
