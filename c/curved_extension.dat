40|$|Abstract. In {{implementation}} of elliptic curve cryptography, {{three kinds of}} finite fields have been widely studied, i. e. prime field, binary field and optimal extension field. In pairing-based cryptography, however, pairingfriendly curves are usually chosen among ordinary curves over prime fields and supersingular <b>curves</b> over <b>extension</b> fields with small characteristics. In this paper, we study pairings on elliptic <b>curves</b> over <b>extension</b> fields {{from the point of}} view of accelerating the Miller’s algorithm to present further advantage of pairing-friendly <b>curves</b> over <b>extension</b> fields, not relying on the much faster field arithmetic. We propose new pairings on elliptic <b>curves</b> over <b>extension</b> fields can make better use of the multi-pairing technique for the efficient implementation. By using some implementation skills, our new pairings could be implemented much more efficiently than the optimal ate pairing and the optimal twisted ate pairing on elliptic <b>curves</b> over <b>extension</b> fields. At last, we use the similar method to give more efficient pairings on Estibals’s supersingular <b>curves</b> over composite <b>extension</b> fields in parallel implementation...|$|R

5000|$|As happens {{generally}} to inlets on the Florida east coast, the predominantly southward longshore drift caused sand to accumulate against the north jetty of the inlet, and eventually {{spill over into}} the inlet and into the Lake Worth Lagoon. The same process also caused erosion of the beach south of the inlet. The height of the inlet jetties was raised, and, in 1937, a sand transfer plant (the first such plant anywhere) was installed on the north jetty to pump sand past the inlet. The transfer plant pumped an average [...] of sand past the inlet {{in the next five}} years. The transfer plant was shut down during World War II due to fuel shortages, and sand again accumulated in the inlet and the lagoon. Following World War II, sand transfer was resumed, and dredging of the accumulated shoals in the inlet and the lagoon began. In 1967 the south jetty was extended 65 ft and a 410 ft <b>curved</b> <b>extension</b> was added to the north jetty.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{determining}} the elastodynamic stress fields associated with the propagation of anti-plane branched cracks is presented. The exact dependence of the stress intensity factor just after branching is given {{as a function of}} the stress intensity factor just before branching, the branching angle and the instantaneous velocity of the crack tip. The jump in the dynamic energy release rate due to the branching process is also computed. Applying a growth criterion for a branched crack, it is shown that the minimum speed of the initial single crack that allows branching is equal to 0. 39 c, where c is the shear wave speed. At the branching threshold, the corresponding bifurcated cracks start their propagation at a vanishing speed with a branching angle of approximately 40 degrees. Using these exact results, the branching of a single propagating crack under mode I loading is also considered and the critical velocity for branching is computed. Moreover, using the asymptotic expansion of the stress field ahead a <b>curved</b> <b>extension</b> of a crack, the experimentally observed shape of the branches is recovered without introducing any additional parameter. It is shown that the length scale introduced by the <b>curved</b> <b>extension</b> of the branches is the geometrical length scale of the experiment. The quantitative comparison with the experimental results agrees with the theoretical findings. The present study confirms that the continuum theory of brittle fracture mechanics provides the minimal ingredients for predicting the branching instability threshold, the branching angle and the subsequent paths of the branches. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{maintenance}} of concrete structures, {{the depth of}} a surface crack {{is an important factor}} to be estimated in inspection. As the nondestructive testing (NDT), the impact-echo method has been extensively applied to the concrete structures. Wave motions resulting from a shortduration mechanical impact are recorded, and peak frequencies of their spectra are identified. However, frequency spectra cannot always be interpreted successfully as many peaks are often observed. Thus, an imaging procedure is developed, which is named as SIBIE (Stack Imaging of spectral amplitudes Based on Impact Echo). The procedure provides twodimensional (2 -D) image of a specimen cross-section. In the present paper, SIBIE procedure is applied to estimating a surface-crack depth of actual cracks generated by a bending test. An accelerometer was employed for the detection. Because the cracks were created in a zigzag manner, a scanning procedure was applied in addition to the conventional one-point detection. It is demonstrated that <b>curved</b> <b>extension</b> of the surface crack is reasonably estimated by a scanning procedure. Thus, it is confirmed that the SIBIE analysis is a promising technique for the crack-depth evaluation in concrete...|$|E
40|$|Stress {{intensity}} {{factors are}} analyzed for a non-collinear crack {{by using a}} second order perturbation method. The method is extended to obtain an approximate representation of stress intensity factors {{at the tip of}} a straight crack with a slightly branched and <b>curved</b> <b>extension.</b> Having examined the near tip asymptotic stress field, the effects of far field boundary conditions are taken into account {{in the sense of a}} matched asymptotic expansion. An energy release rate due to non-collinear crack growth can be calculated by using Irwin's formula. As far as homogeneous materials are concerned, the crack path criterion by which the maximum energy release rate is attained is equivalent to the local symmetry criterion within the second order approximation. Considerations are also made for branched crack extension in materials with inhomogeneous fracture toughness. Paths of brittle cracks propagating along a welded joint are predicted as a practical application of the present method, where the effects of applied stresses, residual stresses, and material deterioration due to welding are taken into considerations...|$|E

Specifically, {{we consider the}} {{case in which the}} representation factors through a false Tate <b>curve</b> <b>extension</b> of Q. First, we consider a semistable elliptic curve E; we construct an integral-valued p-adic measure which interpolates the values the L-values of an Artin twist of E, at a family of finite-order character twists. To do this, we exploit the fact that such an L-value may be written as the Rankin convolution of two Hilbert modular forms, when the representation factors through the false Tate <b>curve</b> <b>extension.</b> Recent developments in non-abelian Iwasawa theory predict certain strong congruences between these p-adic L-functions, and we shall establish weakened versions of these congruences. Next, we prove analogous results for an elliptic curve with complex multiplication; we do this using work of Hida and Tilouine on the p-adic interpolation of Hecke L-functions over a CM-field. We go on to investigate the ratio of the automorphic and motivic periods associated to E in this setting. We describe how the p-valuation of this ratio may be explicitly calculated, and use the computer package MAGMA to produce some numerical examples. We end by proving a formula for the growth of this quantity in terms of the Iwasawa invariants associated to the two-variable extension of the CM-field...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{algorithm}} is proposed to give a global approximation to an implicit real plane algebraic curve with rational quadratic B-splines. The algorithm consists of three steps: curve segmentation, segment approximation and curve tracing. The curve is first divided into so-called triangle convex segments. Then each segment is approximated with several rational quadratic Bézier curves. At last, the curve segments are connected into several maximal branches and each branch is represented by a Bspline curve resulting in a C 1 global parameterization for the curve branch. Due to the detailed geometric analysis, high accuracy of approximation may be achieved with {{a small number of}} quadratic segments. The final approximation based on quadratic spline curves keeps many important geometry features and gives a refined topological structure of the original <b>curve.</b> <b>Extension</b> of the method to spatial curves is also illustrated...|$|R
