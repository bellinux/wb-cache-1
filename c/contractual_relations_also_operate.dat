These reforms have included contracting by public purchasing agencies of external providers. This paper seeks to propose an analytical framework to support {{decision making and}} orient future search for evidences. It was built upon a literature review and four illustrations from Costa Rica Guatemala, Nicaragua and Salvador which focus on primary care providers. A preliminary literature review helped in proposing an initial framework with basic dimensions.

40|$|The {{contract}} of insurance of crops and yields against drought {{is based on}} the risk of decrease of precipitation in comparison with an earlier relevant period. The authors analysed the specificities of the case of draught risk, but also other regulations characteristic of this contractual relationship, both from the economic and the legal point of view. The paper also treats the position of contractual parties in this contractual relationship, partly arising from the monopolising position of the insuring organisation. That part also analyses the contract freedom that is endangered due to unequal positions of contractual parties. Special attention is paid to legal sources, especially the general and special conditions of insurance organisations, seeing as they are the main source of law, as {{there is a lack of}} legal regulation of this field. The number of Serbian insurance organisations that offer this type of insurance is extremely low, as well as the percentage of insurance against this risk. The authors analyse the reasons for which this type of insurance is underdeveloped in Serbia, as well as the consequences of such a state to a safe agricultural production. The paper also covers the topic of the role of legislators and the state in general, in terms of regulation of certain elements of this <b>contractual</b> <b>relation,</b> but <b>also</b> in terms of state incentives that would contribute to a higher percentage of insured agricultural areas. This would reduce the uncertainty and the damage suffered by agricultural producers due to increasing weather fluctuations. Taking into account the inadequate legal and economic tradition, education in this field would represent a significant contribution to the development of this kind of insurance. The authors analyse the difference between the contracts of insurance of crops and yields against drought and the weather derivative contracts, which can be traded on the stock market...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is, through a {{comparative}} analysis of the legal state {{in a number of}} different legal systems, namely the Common law, French law, German law, and the laws of the Nordic countries, to see how these systems differ in their approaches towards interference with <b>contractual</b> <b>relations.</b> Do the different systems find the phenomenon of interference with <b>contractual</b> <b>relations</b> a problem and, if so, in what way and which methods or techniques are used to handle the matter? The purpose is, therefore, also to examine whether different legal systems can, through different approaches, find different solutions to a problem such as interference with <b>contractual</b> <b>relations,</b> and if these solutions have the same effect regarding legal protection. Furthermore, the purpose is to study why and how come the different legal systems have chosen to deal with the matter in different ways.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain the extralegal <b>contractual</b> <b>relations</b> {{governing}} Hawala and other related informal financial transfer systems (IFTS). Hawala, and other IFTF’s, have faced a regulatory onslaught {{in the aftermath of}} the terrorist attacks of September 11, as well as competitive pressures from traditional money transfer systems. Despite these competitive pressures, IFTS’s still occupy a major market position in the money transfer market place, in particular amongst Asian and African immigrant communities in the Western world. Two recent academic papers have theorized what governs the extralegal <b>contractual</b> <b>relations</b> of Hawala, but no literature has been developed based on a case study to confirm these theories. This paper seeks to outline what governs the <b>contractual</b> <b>relations</b> of cross-border Hawaladars by interviewing IFTS brokers in the greater Philadelphia area.

The reason for my research {{is an increasing}} amount {{of consulting}} firms arising in Czech business enviroment as well as non-existence of precise and explicit regulation of these relations in Czech legal system. The thesis is composed of two main chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of management consulting. Chapter One is subdivided into three parts. Part One is introductory and defines basic terminology of management consulting, its history and typology. Part Two deals with subjects of <b>contractual</b> <b>relations</b> between consulting firm and client. Finally part Three explains when these relations will be regulated by Czech commercial contract law. Chapter Two examines relevant Czech legislation in combination with practical examples from valid agreements. The chapter consists of two parts. Part One focuses on particularities of Czech contract law. Part Two investigates what {{should be included in}} consulting agreement. Conclusions are drawn partially in Chapter Two, part One and partially in the epilogue. The main aim of the thesis is to find out what is the economic cause of these relations, and what [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to study the situation of unexpected events which render the performance under the contract much more difficult than originally planned or totally impossible to perform. The research includes the comparative study of different international instruments dealing with the unexpected change of circumstances, also the English and U. S. common law and the relevant case law. The study of the case law showed that though the preference by courts and arbitral tribunals is given to the principle that contracts should be kept, there have been numerous cases where the party has been exempted from contractual obligations under the change of circumstances and this should be regarded as a way to assure the fairness principle in <b>contractual</b> <b>relations.</b> The paper <b>also</b> examines the requirements which are necessary for exclusion of the performance under unexpected change of the circumstances. As a general principle, the occurrence of the unexpected event itself will not be sufficient for exempting a party from contractual obligations. Number of things need to be determined and taken into account when assessing whether the party can be excused for non-performance. Furthermore, as regards to the effects of such events the balance of interests is followed by giving the affected party the right to choose the relevant remedy. Taking into account the complexity of modern contractual relationships, it is preferable that parties follow the principles of good faith and cooperation which lies in the centre of renegotiations. However, in the case of failure to negotiate the parties can “pass” to courts the right to determine whether adjustment or termination will conclude the contractual relationships...|$|R
