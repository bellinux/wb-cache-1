25|$|According to polls {{conducted}} in 2016, Zeman is the front-runner and {{his chances of}} re-election are considered high, although it was speculated that Zeman's candidacy would be determined by his health. Zeman announced his candidacy on 9 March 2017. His bid may receive support from the <b>Czech</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (ČSSD) and ANO 2011. Some commentators have speculated that Zeman could be elected in the first round.|$|E

25|$|In December 2014, the Czech {{government}} {{approved a}} joint recommendation from the Czech National Bank and Ministry of Finance, against setting a formal target date for euro adoption or joining ERM-II {{during the course}} of 2015. In March 2015, the ruling <b>Czech</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> decided at its annual congress to adopt the policy of striving hard to gather political support for the state to adopt the euro by 2020, as one of their four top priorities. In April 2015, the coalition government announced it had agreed not to set a euro adoption target and not to enter ERM-2 before after the next legislative election scheduled for 2017, making it unlikely that the Czech Republic will adopt the euro before 2020. In addition, the coalition government agreed that if it wins re-election it would set a deadline of 2020 to agree on a specific euro adoption roadmap.|$|E

2500|$|The Czech {{word for}} comrade is soudruh (m.) and soudružka (f.). In 19th century Czech, {{it was a}} poetic word, meaning [...] "fellow". As {{elsewhere}} in Europe, the term was originally introduced by the Czech Social Democrats and subsequently carried over to Czech Communists as well when these split off from the Social Democrats. After the Communist Party gained power in 1948, the word displaced all prior titles like pan, paní ("Mister", [...] "Madam") and became the title used generally for everyone. Nowadays, it is used only in (actual or, more often, ironic) Communist context. After the Velvet Revolution, {{an attempt was made}} in the <b>Czech</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> to replace soudruh with přítel ("friend") as a form of an address, but it didn't catch on. A cognate to English word [...] "comrade", kamarád, means [...] "friend" [...] in Czech. It is a very commonly used word and it has no political connotations. A cognate (now obsolete) to the Russian word tovarishch, tovaryš, means [...] "journeyman" [...] in Czech and has no political connotations (cf. Tovaryšstvo Ježíšovo, lit. [...] "Jesus' Journeymen").|$|E
2500|$|Following the 2003 and 2008 elections, {{which both}} {{required}} multiple ballots, {{some in the}} Czech political community expressed dissatisfaction with this method of election. In 2008, Martin Bursík, leader of the Czech Green Party, said of the 2008 vote, [...] "We are sitting {{here in front of}} the public somewhat muddied by backstage horse-trading, poorly concealed meetings with lobbyists and intrigue." [...] There were calls to adopt a system with a direct election, in which the public would be involved in the voting. However, opponents of this plan pointed out that the presidency had always been determined by indirect vote, going back through several predecessor states to the presidency of Tomáš Masaryk. Charles University political scientist Zdeněk Zbořil suggested that direct voting could result in a president and prime minister who were hostile to each other's goals, leading to deadlock. A system of direct elections was supported by figures including Jiří Čunek (Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party) and Jiří Paroubek (<b>Czech</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party),</b> whereas the ruling Civic Democratic Party, under both President Václav Klaus and Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, was more skeptical. Topolánek commented that it was an advantage that [...] "our presidential elections are not preceded by some campaign, that is unavoidable in a direct election and causes rifts among citizens". Using Poland as an unfavourable example, he said that [...] "when someone talks about how our method of selecting the head of state is undignified, he should first weigh the consequences of a direct vote".|$|E
