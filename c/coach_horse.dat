5|$|Postier Bretons were {{developed}} {{as a result of}} crossbreeding with the Norfolk Trotter and the Hackney during the 19th century. This type is bred mainly in central Brittany, has a very attractive gait, is a good <b>coach</b> <b>horse,</b> and capable of light farming work. Its name originates from its use in pulling mail coaches. The Postier was used extensively by the French Horse Artillery, and it {{has been described as a}} lighter version of the Suffolk Punch draft breed from Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{century and}} 19th century, more Arab blood was added by stallions who were {{turned out in}} the Welsh hills. Other breeds have also been added, {{including}} the Thoroughbred, Hackney, Norfolk Roadster, and the Yorkshire <b>Coach</b> <b>Horse.</b> Before the car was developed, the quickest mode of transport in Wales was the Welsh Cob. Tradesmen, doctors, and other businessmen often selected ponies by trotting them the 35 uphill miles from Cardiff to Dowlais. The best ponies could complete this feat in under three hours, never breaking gait. Formal breeding stock licensing was introduced in 1918, but before this, breeding stock was selected by such trotting tests.|$|E
5|$|Before the First World War, {{having seen}} the cavalry feats of mounted Boers during the Second Boer War, Britain {{increased}} its cavalry reserves. Smaller Cleveland Bays were used to carry British troopers, and larger members of the breed pulled artillery; the British War Office offered premiums on Cleveland Bay stallions. Although the First World War was not the cavalry war the British expected, large numbers of horses were used to pull artillery and losses were high. Because the war caused a depletion in stock, in 1920 and 1921, the British society opened a special register for previously unregistered mares of Cleveland Bay type, including some already registered with the Yorkshire <b>Coach</b> <b>Horse</b> (a Cleveland/Thoroughbred cross) registry, after they had passed an inspection that certified them to be of proper breed type. The subsequent foals of these mares were eligible for registration into the main British Cleveland Bay stud book, and were also eligible to compete in competitions reserved for breed members. Some of this progeny was bred and owned by King George V.|$|E

5|$|The Cleveland Bay {{generally}} {{stands between}} , and is always bay in colour. Bright bay horses (bays {{with a more}} reddish tint than normal) are the most preferred by breeders, followed by ordinary bay, dark bay and then light bay. This preference for brighter shades of bay was originally stated in the official breed standard, although this stipulation has since been removed. In some bloodlines of the breed, light, grayish hairs in the mane and tail are known as a characteristic of pure blood. White markings, except for a small star on the forehead, render the horse inadmissible to the stud book. Horses {{are expected to have}} complete black points, including completely black lower legs. Legs that are red below the knees and hocks are considered faulty in colour, although they do not disqualify a horse from registry. The occasional red legs that appear in the breed are thought to come from chestnut Thoroughbred stallions that were crossed into Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire <b>Coach</b> <b>Horse</b> bloodlines at some points in the history of both breeds. The uniformity in colour is encouraged as it makes creating matching driving teams and pairs very easy. When the breed was first developed, the horses almost always had a countershaded dorsal stripe, but these disappeared with the outcrossings of the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|By 1847, {{less than}} {{a fifth of the}} Redefin stallions were without at least one Thoroughbred grandparent, a trait that began to affect the {{soundness}} and longevity of their offspring. In an effort to correct this, draft horse stallions were put to use, but the result was merely a loss of the identifiable type. To regain the utilitarian warmblood type, which differed from the older <b>coach</b> <b>horse</b> type due to the advent of the steam locomotive, suitable horses were purchased from Hannover. As a result of the regular exchange of breeding stock, Mecklenburgers and Hanoverians remained similar to one another, and distinctly different from the heavier Oldenburgers and Holsteiners.|$|E

500|$|The Cleveland Bay {{was used}} in the {{creation}} of the Oldenburg breed, because of its stamina, strength, and jumping ability. The breed was also used to create and improve the Holstein and Hanoverian breeds. In the late 18th century, the Cleveland Bay was used to create the short-lived Yorkshire <b>Coach</b> <b>Horse</b> through crosses with Thoroughbreds. These Yorkshires were used mainly to pull mail and passenger coaches, hence their name. Called by some the [...] "New Cleveland Bay", foreigners often could not distinguish between the two breeds, and many horses registered as Cleveland Bays in European <b>coach</b> <b>horse</b> studbooks were actually Yorkshire Coach Horses. In the 19th century, the Cleveland Bay was crossed with French and Belgian draft horses to create the Vladimir Heavy Draft, a Russian breed developed to fill that country's need for a heavy draft breed.|$|E
500|$|The Frederiksborg horse, another Danish breed, {{influenced}} the Jutland during the 18thcentury. The Frederiksborg {{had a significant}} amount of Spanish influence, and was used to give the Jutland more active gaits. Selection for the modern-day Jutland appears to have begun around 1850, when Suffolk Punch and Ardennes blood was crossbred on native bloodstock. Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire <b>Coach</b> <b>Horse</b> (a Cleveland Bay/Thoroughbred cross) horses were also added during the 19thcentury. The development of the breed was significantly influenced by a stallion named Oppenheim LXII, imported into Denmark in 1862. Sources disagree as to whether Oppenheim was a purebred Suffolk Punch or a Suffolk/Shire cross. Six generations from Oppenheim, his descendant, Aldrup Menkedal (spelled Oldrup Munkedal in some sources), was foaled. Aldrup Munkedal is considered the founding stallion of the modern breed. [...] Most Jutlands alive today descend from two of his sons, Hovding and Prins af Jylland.|$|E
500|$|Horses {{arrived in}} Australia with the First Fleet in 1788 {{along with the}} {{earliest}} colonists. [...] Although horses of part-Thoroughbred blood were imported into Australia during the late 18th century, {{it is thought that}} the first pureblood Thoroughbred was a stallion named Northumberland who was imported from England in 1802 as a <b>coach</b> <b>horse</b> sire. [...] By 1810, the first formal race meets were organized in Sydney, and by 1825 the first mare of proven Thoroughbred bloodlines arrived to join the Thoroughbred stallions already there. [...] In 1825, the Sydney Turf Club, the first true racing club in Australia, was formed. Throughout the 1830s, the Australian colonies began to import Thoroughbreds, almost exclusively for racing purposes, and to improve the local stock. Each colony formed its own racing clubs and held its own races. [...] Gradually, the individual clubs were integrated into one overarching organization, now known as the Australian Racing Board. Thoroughbreds from Australia were imported into New Zealand in the 1840s and 1850s, with the first direct importation from England occurring in 1862.|$|E

500|$|The Clydesdale {{takes its}} name from Clydesdale, the old name for Lanarkshire, noted for the River Clyde. In the mid-18th century, Flemish stallions were {{imported}} to Scotland and bred to local mares, resulting in foals that were larger than the existing local stock. These included a black unnamed stallion imported from England by a John Paterson of Lochlyloch and an unnamed dark-brown stallion owned by the Duke of Hamilton. Another prominent stallion was a [...] <b>coach</b> <b>horse</b> stallion of unknown lineage named Blaze. Written pedigrees were kept of these foals beginning in the early 19th century, and in 1806 a filly, later known as [...] "Lampits mare" [...] after the farm name of her owner, was born that traced her lineage to the black stallion. This mare is listed in the ancestry of almost every Clydesdale living today. One of her foals was Thompson's Black Horse (known as Glancer), who was to have a significant influence on the Clydesdale breed. The first recorded use of the name [...] "Clydesdale" [...] in reference to the breed was in 1826 at an exhibition in Glasgow. Another theory of their origin, that of them descending from Flemish horses brought to Scotland as early as the 15th century, was also promulgated in the late 18th century. However, even the author of that theory admitted that the common story of their ancestry is more likely.|$|E
500|$|Arabian stallions {{were made}} {{available}} to Percheron breeders for use in breeding army mounts, beginning in 1760 at the royal stud at Le Pin. Between 1789 and the early 1800s, the Percheron {{was in danger of}} becoming extinct as horse breeding was suppressed during the French Revolution and its aftermath. Early histories of the breed point to two gray Arabian stallions from Le Pin, Godolphin and Gallipoly, as the blood that helped to restart Percheron breeding. However, later research found that Godolphin was a chestnut Arabian of ordinary conformation and no special worth, while Gallipoly was a gray saddle horse of unknown breeding. Modern breed historians contest that there was enough breeding stock left after the early 19th century to restart the breed without further Arabian influence, and state that it is unlikely that two horses of unremarkable breeding and conformation had a significant influence on the breed. Jean le Blanc, a [...] founding stallion of the Percheron breed, was foaled in 1823. Today, all Percherons trace their ancestry to this stallion. At this time the breed also became larger, with horses from other French districts being imported to Perche to change the Percheron from a <b>coach</b> <b>horse</b> averaging [...] to a draft horse averaging [...] In 1893, the first Percheron stud book was created in France. By 1910, French registrations had risen to almost 32,000 horses. Between 1880 and 1920, Percheron breeders in France exported horses all over the world, including South Africa, South America, Australia and North America.|$|E

From his youth, the black, like all of his race, had been a hard rider; but, bending {{under the weight of}} sixty winters, his African blood had lost some of its native heat. The night was dark, and the wind whistled through the vale with the dreariness of November. When Caesar reached the graveyard, he uncovered his grizzled head with superstitious awe, and threw around him many a fearful glance, in momentary expectation of seeing something superhuman. There was sufficient light to discern a being of earthly mold stealing from among the graves, apparently with a design to enter the highway. It is in vain that philosophy and reason contend with early impressions, and poor Caesar was even without the support of either of these frail allies. He was, however, well mounted on a <b>coach</b> <b>horse</b> of Mr. Wharton's and, clinging {{to the back of the}} animal with instinctive skill, he abandoned the rein to the beast.

The sight of a cheerful fire first told the negro that he had reached the habitation of man, and with it came all his dread of the bloody Virginians; his duty must, however, be done, and, dismounting, he fastened the foaming animal to a fence, and approached the window with cautious steps, to reconnoiter.|$|E
