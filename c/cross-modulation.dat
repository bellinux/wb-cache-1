40|$|Feeding {{and sleep}} are {{fundamental}} behaviours with significant interconnections and <b>cross-modulations.</b> The circadian system and peptidergic signals are important components of this modulation, but still {{little is known}} about the mechanisms and networks by which they interact to regulate feeding and sleep. We show that specific thermogenetic activation of peptidergic Allatostatin A (AstA) -expressing PLP neurons and enteroendocrine cells reduces feeding and promotes sleep in the fruit fly Drosophila. The effects of AstA cell activation are mediated by AstA peptides with receptors homolog to galanin receptors subserving similar and apparently conserved functions in vertebrates. We further identify the PLP neurons as a downstream target of the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF), an output factor of the circadian clock. PLP neurons are contacted by PDF-expressing clock neurons, and express a functional PDF receptor demonstrated by cAMP imaging. Silencing of AstA signalling and continuous input to AstA cells by tethered PDF changes the sleep/activity ratio in opposite directions but does not affect rhythmicity. Taken together, our results suggest that pleiotropic AstA signalling by a distinct neuronal and enteroendocrine AstA cell subset adapts the fly to a digestive energy-saving state which can be modulated by PDF...|$|R

Here, we used SS-EPs to frequency tag the cortical activity elicited by concurrently presented nociceptive, tactile and visual stimuli such as to examine whether this gives rise to additional <b>cross-modulation</b> SS-EPs, indexing the activity of neurons involved in multisensory integration. Indeed, when two distinct neuronal populations oscillate at two distinct frequencies, <b>cross-modulation</b> frequencies, corresponding to the sum or difference of the two main frequencies, may emerge if the signals conveyed by each of the two oscillating populations converge onto another population integrating these inputs. Ten subjects took part in the experiment. The EEG was recorded continuously. Using distinct frequencies, trains of nociceptive stimuli were delivered concurrently to trains of tactile stimuli or visual stimuli stimuli. Participants were asked to detect the occurrence of brief interruptions occurring in one of the two concurrent trains of stimuli. All three stimuli elicited consistent SS-EPs, appearing as separate peaks in the EEG frequency spectrum, with distinct scalp topographies. The nociceptive SS-EP was maximal over the scalp vertex, whereas the tactile SS-EP was maximal over the parietal region contralateral to the stimulated side and the visual SS-EP was maximal over occipital regions, thus indicating that all three responses originate from distinct neuronal populations.
