40|$|This paper {{examines}} empirically {{the current}} practice {{with regard to}} integrated reporting according to the IR Framework among the 104 original participants (companies) of the IIRC Pilot program. We made a selection with respect to these 104 participants based on organization’s stipulation that they issue an integrated report and/or that they made use of the IR Framework for their report in a journey towards integrated reporting. In general we can conclude that the 38 companies in our sample are well ahead on the journey of integrated reporting. These 38 companies comply {{to a certain extent}} with the requirements with respect to the fundamental concepts, guiding principles and content elements of the IR Framework. Also the majority of the annual integrated reports have an assurance opinion. The main Welds of improvements are the connection of the content elements with the capitals and the value creation process. Furthermore, companies should {{pay more attention to the}} <b>content</b> <b>element</b> ‘opportunities’ and not only display their ‘risks’. Also, companies should treat the <b>content</b> <b>element</b> ‘governance’ as a means to create value and have this element connected with the capitals. Currently the governance information is rather traditional and in line with the legal requirements. Moreover there is room for improvement with respect to the <b>content</b> <b>element</b> ‘strategy in relation with resource allocation’ (use of capitals). The <b>content</b> <b>element</b> ‘basis of preparation and presentation’ is often not present in the annual integrated report...|$|E

Indexing is performed in three steps: (i) choosing content elements i. e. those which refer to the semantic content of the documents, (ii) associating a vector to each terminal <b>content</b> <b>element</b> whose components are the weights associated to each indexing term, (iii) propagating these vectors bottom up along the ancestors of the terminal content elements. Querying is performed with XQuery extended by adding to it a vscore function which returns the similarity degree between a query vector and a <b>content</b> <b>element</b> vector and by integrating into it the NEXI language which is a subset of XPath, defined {{in the framework of}} the INEX initiative that we have equipped with a fuzzy semantics...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Most {{document}} structures define layout structures which implicitly define semantic {{relationships between}} content elements. While document structures for text are well established (books, reports, papers etc.), models for time based documents such as multimedia and hypermedia are relatively new and lack established document structures. Traditional document description languages convey domain-dependent semantic relationships implicitly, using domain-independent mark-up for expressing layout. This {{works well for}} textual documents a,s for example, CSS and HTML demonstrate. True device independence, however, sometimes requires a change of document model to maintain the content semantics. To achieve this we need explicit information about the discourse role of the <b>content</b> <b>element.</b> We propose a model in which content is marked-up with the discourse role it plays in the document. This way the formatter has knowledge about the function of a <b>content</b> <b>element</b> so it can make appropriate lay out choices. ...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and problem}} – As {{a result of}} {{financial}} crises and the realization of a broader stakeholder network, recent decades have seen an increase in stakeholder demand for non- financial information in corporate reporting. This {{has led to a}} situation of information overload where separate financial and sustainability reports have developed in length and complexity interdependent of each other. Integrated reporting has been presented as a solution to this problematic situation. The question is whether the corporate world believe this to be the solution and if the development of corporate reporting is heading in this direction. Purpose - This thesis aims to examine and assess to what extent companies listed on the OMX Stockholm 30 (OMXS 30), as per 2016 - 02 - 28, comply with the Strategic <b>content</b> <b>element</b> of the Framework and how this disclosure has developed since the framework’s pilot project and official release by using a self-constructed disclosure index based on its specific items. Methodology – The purpose was fulfilled through an analysis of 104 annual reports comprising 26 companies during the period of 2011 - 2014. The annual reports were assessed using a self-constructed disclosure index based on the Framework <b>content</b> <b>element</b> Strategy and Resource Allocation, where one point was given for each disclosed item. Analysis and conclusions – The study found that the OMXS 30 -listed companies to a large extent complies with the strategic <b>content</b> <b>element</b> of the Framework and that this compliance has seen a steady growth throughout the researched time span. There is still room for improvement however with a total average framework compliance of 84 % for 2014. Although many items are being reported on, there are indications that companies generally miss out on the core values of Integrated reporting. ...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and problem}} - Integrated {{reporting}} {{is a hot}} topic today and is predicted to be the future of companies’ external reporting. In December 2013 a new framework on integrated reporting was released and {{one part of the}} framework concerns governance and how it supports the organization’s value creation. A recent study on integrated reporting in Sweden showed the area of governance to be poorly reported. However, no previous study in Sweden has examined the current state of governance disclosures compared to the framework in depth. This is important in order to find good examples of reporting to further enhance the development of integrated reporting. Purpose - This thesis aims to assess the extent to which Swedish listed companies comply with the guidelines in the framework’s <b>content</b> <b>element</b> governance using a self-constructed scoring system. Furthermore, the aim is to analyze the possible relationship between the results {{and the size of the}} company. Methodology - The purpose was fulfilled through an analysis of 21 annual reports of Swedish listed companies, seven from each segment on the OMX Nordic Stockholm, i. e. large, mid, and small cap. The annual reports were assessed using a self-constructed scoring system primarily based on the framework’s <b>content</b> <b>element</b> governance. Analysis and conclusions - The study found that the majority of the companies at least mention most of the aspects included in the framework. However, the average annual report needs large improvements before it can be claimed to be in line with the framework regarding the area of governance. Furthermore, the study found a relationship between the result of the study and the size of the company, meaning larger firms were more in line with the framework’s <b>content</b> <b>element</b> governance...|$|E

40|$|This thesis posits a 4 th grade foreign {{language}} curriculum emphasizing cultural content {{in a parallel}} structure to social studies content {{as a means of}} addressing the interdisciplinary literacy stressed in the new Common Core State Standards (CCSS). Both the cultural <b>content</b> <b>element</b> and the parallel curriculum structure are compared to viable alternative emphases or structures prevalent in contemporary pedagogical material and practice. Standards of comparison for content foci are derived from the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) World Readiness Standards for Learning Languages aligned with the CCSS and standards of comparison for curriculum structure are derived from various integrated curriculum theories. Conclusions drawn from these comparisons indicate that a language curriculum with equal value on cultural and linguistic content designed in a parallel structure satisfies literacy outcomes of the CCSS, but a different emphasis in {{foreign language}} content may benefit from a different level of integration in curriculum structure...|$|E

30|$|Rety et al. (2008) {{present a}} {{framework}} for interactive narrative authoring {{in the domain of}} virtual storytelling where a user is provided with navigation choices in an interactive narrative. The framework is based on a generalised concept of a section, which is close to a subject in our description. A subject consists of hierarchically structured fragments (a statement in our description). A statement is defined as an atomic <b>content</b> <b>element</b> containing simple text and possibly other media. A statement may also be composed recursively and consist of a set of statements, a behaviour and a termination property. Behaviour can be set by an author as either deterministic to indicate that a user reads in the order of subjects or as non-deterministic to indicate that a user reads with no predefined order. A termination property is a condition that an author sets to determine when a subject terminates. A user then moves on to a following subject. A user reads an interactive narrative created in this framework by successively accessing statements in a subject.|$|E
40|$|The {{probe of}} this {{instrument}} can be {{inserted into the}} flue directly for testing the specific resistivity of fly ash. It adopts the ceramic filtration catcher and iso-speed sampling based on static pressure balance technique with parallel short-tube. The collection efficiency of ceramic filtration catcher (h) can reach even exceed 99. 9 %, and the error of sampling in different velocities is {{less than or equal}} to 5 %. All these make the sameness between samples and the actual fly ash in many facets, including size distribution, carbon <b>content,</b> <b>element</b> compositions, etc. The coefficient of optimizing ringed electrode for concentric cirques k is 14. 6, which can adapt all kinds of fly ash whose specific resistivity is in the range from 104 to 1013 cm×W. In addition, the ceramic filtration catcher made of white corundum powder can endure high temperature, high voltage, and acid cauterization. So this test instrument can work well under the conditions in which the flue temperature is from room temperature to 300 oC and in the caustic gas. Ceramic filtration catcher also has many excellences, such as avoiding disassembly, cleaning ash easily, repeating use for long time. This instrument has obtained the invention patent in China and applied widely in the domestic range. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} {{template}} to promote brief but high-quality communication between paediatric primary care clinicians and consulting specialists. METHODS: Through an iterative process with academic and community-based paediatric primary care providers and specialists, the authors identified what content elements {{would be of}} value when communicating around referrals. The authors then developed a one-page template to encourage both primary care and specialty clinicians to include these elements when communicating about referrals. Trained clinician reviewers examined a sample of 206 referrals from community primary care providers (PCPs) to specialists in five paediatric specialties at an academic medical centre, coding communication content and rating the overall value of the referral communication. The relationship between the value ratings and each <b>content</b> <b>element</b> was examined to determine which content elements contributed to perceived value. RESULTS: Almost all content elements were associated with increased value as rated by clinician reviewers. The most valuable communications from PCP to specialist contained specific questions for the specialist and/or physical exam features, and the most valuable from specialist to PCP contained brief education for the PCP about the condition; all three elements were found in a minority of communications reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: A limited set of communication elements is suitable for a brief communication template in communication from paediatric PCPs to specialists. The use of such a template may add value to interphysician communication...|$|E

Admittance of such Web pages on Small Screen Devices (SSDs) like mobile phones, palmtops, tablets, PDA etc., is increasing {{with the support of}} the current wireless technologies. However, SSDs have limited screen size, memory capacity and bandwidth, which makes accessing the Website on SSDs extremely difficult. There are many approaches have been proposed in literature to regenerate HTML Web pages suitable for browsing on SSDs. These proposed methods involve segment the Web page based on its semantic structure, followed by noise removal based on block features and to utilize the hierarchy of the <b>content</b> <b>element</b> to regenerate a page suitable for Small Screen Devices. But World Wide Web consortium stated that, HTML does not provide a better description of semantic structure of the web page contents. To overcome this draw backs, Web developers started to develop Web pages using new technologies like XML, Flash etc. It makes a way for new research methods. Therefore, we require an approach to reconstruct these Web pages suitable for SSDs. However, existing approaches in literature do not perform well for Web pages erected using XML and Flash. In this paper, we have emphasized a few issues of the existing approaches on XML, Flash Datasets and propose an approach that performs better on data set comprising of Flash Web pages...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to present the {{development}} of sections and features in newspapers published in Osijek from mid- 19 th to mid- 20 th century. The paper focuses on the establishment, development and shaping of sections, i. e. their setting, headings, name changes, change patterns, graphic and typographical solutions, etc. The research was conducted in the Newspaper Collection of the Museum of Slavonia. It was based on two criteria: years of publication and cultural importance, and included the following newspapers: Die Drau, Slavonische Presse, Narodna (Hrvatska) obrana and Hrvatski list. The research results prove that newspaper sections and features are only in the initial stage of development as a concept of newspaper content organization. Their names are mostly highlighted graphically as sub-headings on a page, often not systematically. The more important news is often not embedded in feature sections - features are a <b>content</b> <b>element</b> and not an organizational category. They often gather related information and occur only when there’s a sufficient amount of particular type of information. The paper takes {{a fresh look at}} investigating the history of Croatian newspapers, showing not only the development of sections and features, but also how research of this type can help reconstruct social change and the way it is reflected in daily newspapers, as we can assume that a new section or feature is introduced only when there is increased interest or sufficient attention of the public to a particular topic...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand of}} {{browsing}} information from general Web pages using a mobile phone is increasing. However, since {{the majority of}} Web pages on the Internet are optimized for browsing from PCs, {{it is difficult for}} mobile phone users to obtain sufficient information from the Web. Therefore, a method to reconstruct PCoptimized Web pages for mobile phone users is essential. An example approach is to segment the Web page based on its structure, and utilize the hierarchy of the <b>content</b> <b>element</b> to regenerate a page suitable for mobile phone browsing. In our previous work, we have examined a robust automatic Web page segmentation scheme which uses the distance between content elements based on the relative HTML tag hierarchy, i. e., the number and depth of HTML tags in Web pages. However, this scheme has a problem that the content-distance based on the order of HTML tags does not always correspond to the intuitional distance between content elements on the actual layout of a Web page. In this paper, we propose a hybrid segmentation method which segments Web pages based on both the content-distance calculated by the previous scheme, and a novel approach which utilizes Web page layout information. Experiments conducted to evaluate the accuracy of Web page segmentation results prove that the proposed method can segment Web pages more accurately than conventional methods. Furthermore, implementation and evaluation of our system on the mobile phone prove that our method can realize superior usability compared to commercial Web browsers...|$|E

Using a faceted classification scheme to categorize site content, the researchers explore {{the extent to which}} consistency has developed in the scope and content of Web sites for authors in the canon of American literature. The goal is to identify both the full range of unique content on these Web sites and, within that range, the core <b>content</b> <b>elements</b> that comprise the “American Author Web Site ” genre. The authors also gathered biographical details on each author, to consider the question of whether Web site content varies by an author’s gender or racial background. Ultimately, the goal is to identify a set of common and/or “best ” practices for content and organization of author Web sites that will assist both undergraduate students and advanced researchers looking for author information on the Web, as well as site designers hoping to create quality resources for these users.
