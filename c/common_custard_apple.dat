40|$|Now a day’s {{increasing}} in prices and depletion of fossil fuels, creates very necessary {{to find out}} an alternative fuel (biodiesel) from non-edible oil seeds. This paper deals with the transesterification of <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> seed oil by means of methanol in presence of Potassium hydroxide catalyst at less than 65 ˚C. The viscosity of biodiesel produced from <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> seed oil is nearer {{to that of the}} commercially available diesel. The <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> seed oil is characterized by GC (gas chromatography) analysis and the important properties of biodiesel such as density, flash point, cloud point, pour point and kinematic viscosity, ash content, carbon residue are found out and compared with that of ASTM-biodiesel standards and commercially available diesel.

40|$|Recently, {{researchers}} {{have taken a}} shift to utilize the <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> for wine preparation besides its major use in ice cream, confectionary and milk products. In the present study, an attempt {{has been made to}} study the effect of maturation on physico-chemical and sensory quality characteristics of <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> wine. <b>Custard</b> <b>apple</b> wine was prepared as per the earlier standardized method. The wine so prepared was matured for six months. The physico-chemical analysis was conducted at every three months interval for six months and sensory evaluation was performed after six months of storage. With the maturation, a decrease in total soluble solids, total sugars, titratable acidity, ethanol, total phenols and tannins was observed, whereas, an increase in reducing sugars and pH was observed. All the sensory quality characteristics of <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> wine increased with advancement of the maturation period except astringency. Cluster analysis of the data obtained from physico-chemical analysis revealed that {{there was no difference between}} three months and six months of storage. Physico-chemical characteristics of <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> wine were reduced to two principal components using principal component analysis which accounted for 100 % variation.

40|$|Climate {{affects the}} <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> {{industry}} {{in a range}} of ways through impacts on growth, disease risk, fruit set and industry location. Climates in Australia are influenced by surrounding oceans, and are very variable from year to year. However, amidst this variability there are significant trends, with Australian annual mean temperatures increasing since 1910, and particularly since 1950, with night-time temperatures increasing faster (0. 11 oC/decade) than daytime temperatures (0. 06 oC/decade). These temperature increases and other climate changes are expected to continue as a result of greenhouse gas emissions, with ongoing impacts on the <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> industry. Five sites were chosen to assess possible future climate changes : Mareeba, Yeppoon, Bundaberg, Nambour and Lismore, these sites representing the extent of the majority of <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> production in eastern Australia. A fifth site (Coffs Harbour) was selected as it is south of the current production regions. A mean warming of 0. 8 to 1. 2 oC is anticipated over most of these sites by the year 2030, relative to 1990.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the production cost and economic indicators associated with the production and sales of fruits from 20 <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> progenies during the initial five harvests, in order to identify the harvest season from which <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> exploitation becomes profitable, as well as the most promising progenies from an economic point of view. The fruit yield data upon which the present work was based were obtained during the period from 2001 to 2005, in an experiment that evaluated 20 <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> half-sibling progenies, under sprinkler irrigation.

40|$|The <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> (Annona {{squamosa}} L.), {{also known}} as the sugar apple, is a fruit species native to Brazil that has been poorly studied, especially in relation to the effect of humic substances on its fruit quality and yield. An experiment was conducted from December 2010 to November 2011 to evaluate the fruit quality and yield of the <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> as a function of nitrogen fertilising and the use of humic substances. The experimental design consisted of randomised blocks, with treatments distributed in a factorial arrangement (4 x 2), using four nitrogen doses (0, 100, 175 and 250 g of N plant- 1) and two humic substance applications (with and without humic substances), with four replications. The fruit yield and fruit characteristics, such as fruit mass, titratable acidity (TA), soluble solids (SS), pulp pH and SS/TA ratio, were recorded. The humic substances and the nitrogen levels significantly affected the soluble solids, titratable acidity and SS/TA ratio, while the pH pulp was only influenced by the humic substances. The humic substances promoted a quantitative increase in the fruit yield of 0. 63 ton ha- 1. The fruit quality and yield of the <b>custard</b> <b>apple</b> depend on the nitrogen fertiliser and the interaction of the humic substances. Nitrogen fertilising of 100 g per plant, associated with humic substances, could be recommended for use in the production of <b>custard</b> <b>apples.</b> ...|$|R
