5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> trails behind the steering axis ground <b>contact</b> <b>point.</b> The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{final section}} of the motorway, the northernmost section between the Umag {{interchange}} and the Slovenian border at Kaštel and Dragonja border crossing, is currently spanned by a two-lane connector road via a roundabout located at the provisional northern terminus of the A9. Since the Kaštel and Dragonja border crossing is the agreed <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> for the motorway link between Croatia and Slovenia, the section {{is expected to be}} built when Slovenia completes its H5 expressway; connecting the border crossing to Koper and its motorway system. The Slovenian motorway development company DARS made plans in 2010 to build the expressway.|$|E
5|$|The trail follows forest tracks, {{mountain}} paths, boreens {{and quiet}} country roads. Mountains, upland lakes and steep-sided glacial valleys {{make up the}} terrain of the initial northern sections of the Way before giving way to gentler rolling foothills in the latter southern sections. Much of the route follows the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> between the igneous granite of {{the western side of}} Wicklow and the metamorphic schists and slates of the eastern side. The principal habitat of the upland sections is a mixture of broadleaf and coniferous woodland, heath and blanket bog while in the lowland sections the hedgerows marking the boundaries between fields support a variety of wildlife. The Way also passes the Monastic City at Glendalough, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E

The latter may be bodiless or winded onto a coil body and subsequently {{be transferred to}} a T-segment or directly to the stator laminations, depending on the application. Contingent on the expected <b>contact</b> <b>points,</b> there are three different options {{for the production of}} T-segments.For one, there is the classic single T-segment with the disadvantage of having a high number of <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> In addition, there is the phase winded T-segment with a reduced number of <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> Finally, there is also the winding of so-called pole chains with a drastically reduced number of <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract:In this paper, {{we discuss}} {{grasping}} and manipulation {{of an object}} by two-fingered robot hand, {{each of which has}} six de-grees of freedom. The contact motion between the object and each fingertip is assumed to be the pure rolling. In addition to the grasping and manipulation, we discuss the regulation of the <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> between the fingers and the object. First, we pro-vide a general formulation of a linearizing compensator for the motion of the object, the grasping force and some of the <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> Second, we propose a control method which regulates all of the <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> by utilizing a single closed path of the some of the <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> Numerical examples are shown to prove the efficiency...|$|R

5|$|Food {{impaction}} {{occurs when}} food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is {{pushed into the}} gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the <b>contact</b> <b>point.</b> Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain {{and a feeling of}} pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{has survived}} {{for so long}} due to {{vegetative}} cloning. The visible tree is relatively young, but {{it is part of}} an older root system that dates back thousands of years. The trunk of the tree may die and regrow multiple times, but the tree's root system remains intact and in turn sprouts another trunk. The trunk may only live for about 600 years, and when one trunk dies another eventually grows back in its place. Also, each winter, heavy snow may push the tree's low-lying branches to ground level, where they take root and survive to grow again the next year in a process known as layering. Layering occurs when a tree's branch comes in contact with the earth, and new roots sprout from the <b>contact</b> <b>point.</b> Other trees, such as coast redwoods and western redcedars are known to reproduce by layering. The tree's age was determined by carbon-14 dating of the root system, which found roots dating back to 375, 5,660, 9,000, and 9,550 years. Carbon dating is not accurate enough to pin down the exact year the tree sprouted from seed; but, given the estimated age, the tree is supposed to have sprouted around 7550 BC. For comparison, the invention of writing (and thus, the beginning of recorded history) did not occur until around 4000 BC. Researchers have found a cluster of around 20 spruce trees in the same area, all over 8,000 years old.|$|E

25|$|A {{difficult}} shot {{in tennis}} is {{the return of}} an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player. When the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> {{is higher than the}} reach of a two-handed backhand, most players will try to execute a high slice (under the ball or sideways). Fewer players attempt the backhand sky-hook or smash. Rarely, a player will go for a high topspin backhand, while themselves in the air. A successful execution of any of these alternatives requires balance and timing, with less margin of error than the lower <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> backhands, since this shot is a break in the regular pattern of play.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{friction}} and wear behaviour of a brass-steel and a copper-steel pairing is investigated and compared. For this purpose, an adapted ball-on-prism test configuration is used. With the proposed test setup, {{the evolution of}} the coefficient of friction and the surface temperature, as well as, the linear wear rate and the weight loss are obtained. The influence of the normal load, the sliding velocity, and the number of <b>contact</b> <b>points</b> are examined. The results for the brass-steel pairing reveal no dependency of the coefficient of friction on the normal load and the number of <b>contact</b> <b>points,</b> whereas for higher sliding velocities, a slight increase of the coefficient of friction can be observed. The linear wear rate increases with the normal load, the sliding velocity, and the number of <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> The coefficient of friction for the copper-steel pairing decreases with an increase of the normal load, increases for higher sliding velocities, and shows no obvious dependency on the number of <b>contact</b> <b>points.</b> The linear wear rate decreases with increasing sliding velocity and increases with the number of <b>contact</b> <b>points...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the neural system provides feedback to the vascular system of its need for more glucose is partly the release of glutamate as part of neuron firing. This glutamate affects nearby supporting cells, astrocytes, causing a change in calcium ion concentration. This, in turn, releases nitric oxide at the <b>contact</b> <b>point</b> of astrocytes and intermediate-sized blood vessels, the arterioles. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator causing arterioles to expand and draw in more blood.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} new control scheme of {{decentralized}} multi-legged robot based on Follow-the-Contact-Point (FCP) gait control. In this control scheme, the first legs <b>contact</b> the <b>points</b> allocated on the terrain {{and the following}} legs touch the foot on the point which the fore leg is contacting. By creating adequate <b>contacting</b> <b>points</b> on the environ-ment, the robot can be navigated successfully. Since the position information of the <b>contacting</b> <b>points</b> is relayed based on physical information of the legs, each leg does not need the global position of the <b>contacting</b> <b>point.</b> As a result, the pro-posed control scheme realizes decentralized architecture.
