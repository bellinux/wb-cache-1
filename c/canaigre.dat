5000|$|During 1912-1913, the Highline and Western canals {{were built}} to supply {{water from the}} Salt River to the South Mountain area, which led to further {{agricultural}} development. In addition to raising cattle, the land was used for raising alfalfa, cotton, oranges and other citrus trees, <b>canaigre</b> (a plant that produces tannin used for tanning leather), and even Louis Janssens' Belgian-American Ostrich Farm, which operated on 230 acre of Bartlett-Heard subdivided land until World War I. (Two other families, the Petersons and Pickrells, also operated ostrich farms in South Phoenix; all of these ostrich farms were between 16th St. and 40th St., south of Southern Ave.) ...|$|E
30|$|In our study, the {{reducing}} agent comes from extracts of Rumex hymenosepalus, {{which is a}} plant rich in polyphenols. In the literature, there is no report on the synthesis of nanoparticles using extracts from this plant. It is a vegetal species abundantly present in North Mexico and {{in the south of}} the USA. In Mexico, it is collected, dried, cut, and packed for selling to the public. This plant, also known as <b>canaigre</b> dock or wild rhubarb, can be of interest for green synthesis because it contains a large amount of natural antioxidants. Among the antioxidant molecules this plant contains, polyphenolic compounds, like flavan- 3 -ols (tannins) and stilbenes, are found in large quantities. These molecules are potentially strong {{reducing agent}}s due to their numerous OH groups that promote their antioxidant activity[50, 51].|$|E
