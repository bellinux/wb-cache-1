5|$|The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<b>CITES)</b> first {{listed the}} two known species of slow loris under Appendix II on 7January1975. All newly {{identified}} species {{were covered by}} Appendix II on 2April1977 when all primates were given either Appendix I or Appendix II protection. Appendix II only requires an export permit for international trade, as long as trade will not negatively impact the survival of wild populations. Most of the trade in slow lorises, however, is illegal and usually involves smuggling to Japan. The lack of legal trade reported to the <b>CITES</b> Secretariat {{is shown in the}} <b>CITES</b> trade database, where minimal trade by <b>CITES</b> Parties has been reported up until 2007. Regardless, slow lorises remained vulnerable to international trade under Appendix II, and the rampant Southeast Asian pet trade was another reason for concern. As a result, Cambodia proposed that slow lorises be elevated to Appendix I, which prohibits species from being traded internationally for commercial purposes and requires both import and export permits for certain types of non-commercial trade, such as scientific research. The proposal covered all three species recognized at the time—the Sunda slow loris, Bengal slow loris, and pygmy slow loris—because they have traditionally been managed collectively owing to a lack of knowledge as to how to distinguish them.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{extent to}} which {{articles}} are <b>cited</b> is a surrogate of the impact and importance of the research conducted; poorly <b>cited</b> articles may identify research of limited use and potential wasted investments. We assessed trends in the rates of poorly <b>cited</b> articles and journals in the cardiovascular literature from 1997 to 2007. Methods and Results: We identified original articles published in cardiovascular journals and indexed in the Scopus citation database from 1997 to 2007. We defined poorly <b>cited</b> articles as those with ≤ 5 citations in the 5 years following publication and poorly <b>cited</b> journals as those with > 75 % of journal content poorly <b>cited.</b> We identified 164 [*] 377 articles in 222 cardiovascular journals from 1997 to 2007. From 1997 to 2007, the number of cardiovascular articles and journals increased by 56. 9 % and 75. 2 %, respectively. Of all the articles, 75 [*] 550 (46. 0 %) were poorly <b>cited,</b> of which 25 [*] 650 (15. 6 % overall) had no citations. From 1997 to 2007, the proportion of poorly <b>cited</b> articles declined slightly (52. 1 %- 46. 2 %, trend P< 0. 001), although the absolute number of poorly <b>cited</b> articles increased by 2595 (trend P< 0. 001). At a journal level, 44 % of cardiovascular journals had more than three-fourths of the journal's content poorly <b>cited</b> at 5 years. Conclusion: Nearly half of all peer-reviewed articles published in cardiovascular journals are poorly <b>cited</b> 5 years after publication, and many are not <b>cited</b> at all. The cardiovascular literature {{and the number of}} poorly <b>cited</b> articles both increased substantially from 1997 to 2007. The high proportion of poorly <b>cited</b> articles and journals suggests inefficiencies in the cardiovascular research enterprise.
