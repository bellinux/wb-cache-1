40|$|Worldwide declines of {{fish stocks}} raise {{concerns}} about deleterious consequences of harvesting for stock abundances and individual life histories, {{and call for}} appropriate recovery strategies. Fishes in exploited stocks mature earlier at either larger or smaller sizes due to both genetic and plastic responses. The latter occur commonly when reduced competition for food leads to faster growth. Using a size-structured consumer¿resource model, which accounts for both genetic and plastic responses, we show that fisheries induced evolutionary changes in individual life history and stock properties can easily become irreversible. As a result of annual spawning, early maturation at small sizes and late maturation at large sizes can become alternative, evolutionarily and ecologically stable states under otherwise identical environmental conditions. Exploitation of late-maturing populations can then induce an evolutionary regime shift to smaller maturation sizes associated with stepwise, 1 -year decreases in age at first reproduction. Complete and early fishing moratoria slowly reverse this process, but belated or partial <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>fisheries</b> may accelerate or even instigate further evolution to smaller sizes at maturation. We suggest that stepwise decreases in maturation age {{can be used as}} early warnings of upcoming evolutionary changes, and should inspire timely restrictions of fisheries...|$|E

40|$|Small {{pelagic fish}} are termed “wasp-waist” species as they {{dominate}} mid trophic levels and comprise relatively few species but attain large abundances that can vary drastically in size. They {{have been found}} to exert top-down control on their prey species and bottom-up control on their predators and, in this way, appear to induce unsuspected ecosystem dynamics. Largely based on model results, this chapter explores these effects and associated dynamics, not only illustrating the importance of small pelagic fish in structuring marine ecosystems, but also revealing the consistency of the role of small pelagic fish across various upwelling systems in which they play key roles. The Northern and Southern Benguela, Southern Humboldt, South Catalan Sea and North and Central Adriatic Sea ecosystems are compared in terms of the importance and role of small pelagic fish using information gained from landings and ecological models. Trophic level of the catch, the Fishing-in-Balance (FiB) index and the ratio of pelagic:demersal fish are calculated from reported landings. Sums of all flows to detritus are compared across modelled ecosystems. Models of the Southern Benguela, Southern Humboldt and South Catalan Sea are used to perform two simulations: (1) <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>fisheries</b> on small pelagic fish and (2) collapse of small pelagic fish stocks, to further explore the roles of small pelagic fish in the dynamics of these ecosystems.

40|$|The penaeidean Litopenaeus schmitti, {{popularly known}} as white shrimp, is a species of great {{economic}} importance, being a target of fishing fleets in the southeast region of Brazil. It is distributed through the western Atlantic, from Cuba to Brazil, until Rio Grande do Sul. Adults are found from shallow depths up to 30 m and {{have been found to}} depths of 47 m in the state of Rio de Janeiro, while juveniles are located in bays and estuaries. The studied species is seasonally distributed in the region of Ubatuba. The objectives of this study are to analyze the abundance and ecological distribution of L. schmitti and to assess if and when juveniles use the Indaia estuary during their life cycle. Furthermore, the hypothesis was tested that the main period of recruitment in the bay coincides with the period of <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>fisheries</b> defined by the Instruction of IBAMA. To that end, samples were taken monthly from July 2005 through June 2007, both in Ubatuba Bay and in the estuary formed by the Rio Indaia. At each sampling station, salinity, temperature (bottom), depth, organic matter content (%), and grain size of sediments were measured. We found that the largest catches in the estuary were in late spring and early summer. In Ubatuba Bay, peak catches occurred during winter and early spring, whereas in the second year, already in May, there was a high peak capture. The variation in the number of individuals was correlated with some environmental factors both in the estuary and in the inlet (p < 0. 05). In the estuary, abundance was positively correlated with temperature (p = 0. 008) and organic matter (p = 0. 025) and negatively with depth (p = 0. 009). Regarding the Ubatuba Bay, only temperature (p = 0. 034) and depth (p = 0. 013) were significantly associated with the distribution of the shrimp, both being negative relations. The shrimp L. schmitti uses both the estuarine as well the shore environment, particularly the Ubatuba estuary and its adjacent bay, to complete its life cycle. The proposed period of fisheries closure (between March to May in the state of Sao Paulo) for this and other shrimps coincides with individuals capable of reproduction entering the inlet and thus are being protected.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{research}} in this Ph. D. dissertation focuses {{on the relationship between}} fishery-dependent catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and abundance and how its use when assessing and managing fisheries may be affected by some of its shortcomings. CPUE data are often used to provide information on the historical and current stock size, but changes in CPUE may not be proportional to abundance. Hyperstability is when CPUE declines slower than abundance and can result in optimistic estimates of abundance and risk of overfishing. Hyperdepletion is when CPUE declines faster than abundance and using these data in an assessment can produce pessimistic estimates of abundance. Assuming a proportional relationship between CPUE and abundance when CPUE actually has a nonlinear relationship with abundance can misinform management and result in overfishing or lost yield. Instead, the nonlinear relationship can be modeled and estimated. Three stand-alone chapters are presented in this dissertation with methods and results from analyses estimating the amount of nonlinearity in the relationship between CPUE and abundance and its implications on fisheries management. The first chapter investigated the nonlinearity between empirical CPUE data and abundance from orange roughy fisheries in Australia and New Zealand. Data from four orange roughy stocks were integrated using a Bayesian hierarchical state-space model to estimate the hyperparameters of a distribution for a nonlinearity parameter in the relationship between CPUE and abundance. Hyperdepletion was more probable than hyperstability and a prior distribution for an unknown stock showed a 83 % probability of hyperdepletion. This study is unique because it used data from the beginning of a fishery and created a prior distribution that may be used in future assessments. The second chapter used simulation to look at the ability to estimate nonlinearity in CPUE data using different models, assumptions, and types of data. A deterministic delay-difference model, a deterministic age-structured model, and a state-space delay-difference model were used to estimate the nonlinearity parameter of simulated CPUE data with a hyperstable, proportional, or hyperdepleted relationship to abundance. Estimates of the nonlinearity parameter were mostly unbiased, but highly variable. Using an informative prior distribution resulted in lower variance, but higher bias when the prior was not congruent with the true level of nonlinearity. Overall, the state-space model showed the best performance, and an informative prior distribution was useful {{as long as it is}} appropriate, justifiable, and wide enough to support all possible values of the nonlinearity parameter. The final chapter performed a management strategy evaluation to determine the consequences of managing a fish stock with and without estimating a nonlinearity parameter between CPUE and abundance. An age-structured operating model was used to simulate a true population from which CPUE and survey data were generated, where CPUE data were either hyperstable, proportional, or hyperdepleted. Estimation models with the nonlinearity parameter estimated or fixed at proportionality were used to estimate population trajectories from the simulated data. Two-area age-structured operating models with movement dependent on fishing effort and density-dependence were also investigated. The benefits to estimates of stock status and yield objectives when estimating a nonlinearity parameter were dependent on the true underlying relationship between CPUE and abundance. Hyperstable scenarios were especially risky, and should always be accounted for, or at least acknowledged, in a management strategy. Hyperdepletion scenarios, on the other hand, may seem to be less of a concern due to reduced conservation risk, but the negative consequences of reduced yield, at least in the short term, and a pessimistic view of the stock, and thus the management system, make it worthwhile to at least acknowledge the potential for hyperdepletion and that not accounting for it is a chosen management strategy. In the long-term, yield was similar whether or not nonlinearity was estimated, but if when estimating nonlinearity, risk to the stock was reduced when CPUE were hyperstable and although risk increased when CPUE showed hyperdepletion, stock status was typically always higher than the hyperstable scenarios. Nonlinearity in CPUE is common in many fisheries and it was seen that CPUE declined faster than abundance during the initial development of orange roughy fisheries. The presence of hyperdepletion can result in pessimistic views of stock status which may result in lost yield, the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>fisheries,</b> and conflict amongst user groups. Estimating a nonlinearity parameter in assessments and acknowledging that nonlinearity exists can improve management by bringing catches and stock depletion closer to target levels...|$|E

Today {{the design}} and {{construction}} business has implanted a demand for a new market, returning altered waterways to a more natural condition; undoing the harm and damage that have accumulated with years of over and misuse to our rivers and streams. During the seventies, a different paradigm managed our waterways, the building of stream banks made of cement and rock, the altering of structure in the channels was meant to control the flow and sediment levels, with little regret to the damage the eco-system received. These new changes in techniques are due to the high demand of the economic returns that our water resources are gaining for our communities. According to the National River Restoration Science Synthesis over one billion dollars is the annual cost to restore our eco-systems, however the damage often is so extensive, there is no restoring the eco-system back to its original condition. This gives to the process being more of a rehabilitation practice, moving it closer to its natural movement (Landers, 2010). At the Federal level, the NRCS is continually working towards channel stabilization and wetland restoration. It provides funding and technical design assistance for private properties. It has produced manuals such as ‘Stream Restoration Design Handbook’, Stream Restoration Planning and Design: Fluvial System Stabilization and Restoration: Field Guide. Other agencies engaged in efforts are the U. S. Forest Service, which oversees 193 million acres covering 200, 000 miles of streams and rivers (Landers, 2010). Wetlands should be preserved and recognized, as a valuable resource assuring a balance in the environment. These wet sponge areas function in multiple ways {{for a variety of}} creatures, man included. They are home to many fish and wildlife, while improving and protecting our water quality, functioning as storage for floodwaters, and maintaining the surface water, especially during dry periods. Rivers and streams flow naturally and along them are mini ecosystems, in which many plants and animals rely upon. However, these natural flow regimes are being altered, destroyed, and polluted, thereby changing the use of the rivers, streams and creeks that are responsible for the transportation of waste disposal, hydroelectricity, intensive agriculture demand, flood-control projects, and so many other human activities. Only two percent of our rivers remain in a natural state here in the U. S. The natural functions have almost disappeared, largely due to man’s need to control flooding. As a result, many species have disappeared, or relocated, causing the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> <b>fisheries,</b> depletion of ground water sources and declines in the quality of the water and its availability (E. P. Agency, (2001). Natural disturbances to the eco-system occur regularly, with little room for adaptability, some of these natural causes are fires, floods, droughts, storms, herbivore and disease outbreaks. However, these disturbances are vital to the maintenance of a healthy and productive ecosystem i. e. many plants and animals contribute to producing clean air and water by allowing nutrient cycling to occur(Davis, 2001). These wondrous areas, once thought as waste lands, are only now being appreciated; almost too late, as they are disappearing, leaving our surface water and groundwater sources to evaporate. Groundwater withdrawals have increased by 46 %, while forty-two percent of the nation’s stream length are found in poor biological condition, leaving 40 % of the freshwater fish to become vulnerable, threatened or endangered (U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2011). The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there were approximately 39. 8 million acres of wetlands found within the coastal watersheds in 2004; this measures a net loss of 361, 000 acres lost between 1998 and 2004 that equals an average loss of approximately 59, 000 acres over that 6 -year period. Those exhibiting the greatest loss are found in the Gulf of Mexico, which is six times higher than the rate of fresh-water wetland loss along the Atlantic coast, while there was a net gain of 24, 650 acres in the Great Lakes coastal watershed. (Stedman, 2008). These magnificent places are home {{to a wide variety of}} bird species, who live within the area year-round, while others use the wetland areas along their migration route, when traveling between their winter and summer grounds.

40|$|Seasonal area <b>closures</b> <b>of</b> <b>fisheries</b> are {{primarily}} {{used to reduce}} fishing mortality on target species. In the absence of effort controls, fishing vessels displaced from a closed area will impact fish populations and the environment elsewhere. Based on the observed response of the North Sea beam trawl fleet to the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the "cod box" and an existing size-based model of the impacts of beam trawling, we predict the effects <b>of</b> seasonal area <b>closures</b> on benthic communities in the central North Sea.

The increased homogeneity, coupled with the displacement of trawling activity to previously unfished areas, is predicted to have slightly greater cumulative impacts on total benthic invertebrate production and lead to localized reductions in benthic biomass for several years. To ensure the effective integration <b>of</b> <b>fisheries</b> and environmental management, the wider consequences <b>of</b> <b>fishery</b> management actions should be considered a priori. Thus, when seasonal closures increase the homogeneity of overall disturbance or lead to the redistribution of trawling activity to environmentally sensitive or previously unfished areas, then effort reductions or permanent area closures should be considered as a management option. The latter would lead to a single but permanent redistribution of fishing disturbance, with lower cumulative impacts on benthic communities in the long run...|$|R

40|$|Fish in many {{exploited}} stocks {{grow faster}} and mature earlier at either larger or smaller sizes {{in comparison to}} pre-exploitation periods. These changes can be driven by both genetic and phenotypic responses. We have shown recently that their interplay can lead to irreversible evolutionary regime shifts in individual life histories and stock properties. Our results {{were based on a}} model which assumed annual spawning and size- and density-dependent individual growth in a deterministic environment. We now extend the analysis to cover stochasticity in recruitment, survival after recruitment and harvesting pressure, including the possibility of bycatch and illegal fishing after fishing moratoria or reduced harvest rates are imposed. We show that under low and moderate stochasticity, early maturation at small sizes and late maturation at large sizes can still persist as alternative, evolutionary and ecologically stable states under otherwise identical environmental conditions. Typically, maturation sizes of the late-maturing phenotypes decrease with increasing stochasticity, while those of the early-maturing phenotypes remain nearly constant. Consequently, we confirm that even in stochastic environments, exploitation of late-maturing populations can induce rapid evolution to smaller maturation sizes associated with stepwise decreases in mean age at first reproduction. These changes can be reversed by fishing moratoria; more stochastic environments and/or harvesting pressure require faster <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fishery.</b> Unless stochasticity is too strong, incomplete <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fishery</b> may also lead to the counterintuitive, accelerated evolution towards smaller sizes at maturation which we reported for the deterministic system...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMarine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) are now {{viewed as an}} efficient tool {{to fight against the}} global deterioration of habitats and fish populations. However their efficiency and effects on the whole trophic network are little known. Based on the Bolong de Bamboung (Senegal) case study, the objective {{of this study is to}} assess the impact of a MPA on the entire trophic network using trophodynamic models. This estuarine small MPA is scientifically surveyed since 2003, one year before the <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fishery.</b> Using the resulting dataset, we calculated time series of abundance indices and constructed two Ecopath mass-balanced models for the year 2003 (fished) and the 2006 - 2008 period (unfished). Using EcoTroph, an ecosystem trophic-level based model, we compared the two periods and simulated a <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fishery</b> starting from 2003 to assess the effect of the MPA. We observed a rather constant total biomass, but a biomass increase by a 2. 5 factor in predators and a decrease by a 1. 7 factor in their preys. Simulations showed that the increase in predators was too important to only being a direct consequence of the removal of the fishing mortality and a local production. This highlighted the role of the MPA as a refuge or a foraging arena for some predator species. What's more, the decrease of the preys, corresponding to pelagic species, was very important and couldn't be explained only by an increase of the predation plus a release of the fishing pressure. This indicated other possible effects as environmental and behavioural ones, in addition of a direct MPA effect. Sensitivity testing and a comparison with another nearby similar but fished area, the Bolong de Sangako, validated the same global conclusion. We concluded that the fishing closure had direct effects but also indirect ones likely due to fish behaviour and environment, and that trophodynamic models are useful tools to analyse MPA effects on the whole trophic networ...|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{subsequently}} re-branded International Stores and {{was acquired by}} BAT Industries in 1972. In 1973, the Price Rite chain was purchased, adding stores to the International brand. This was further increased by the purchase of Wallis Supermarkets in 1977, which added a further 100 stores. After acquiring the large footprint Mac Food Centres from Unilever's <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> Mac <b>Fisheries,</b> in 1979, the chain created a new brand, Mainstop, to develop the new superstore division in 1980. However, BAT decided to sell any business that failed to progress and so the company was sold off in chunks. Former Price Rite stores {{in the south of}} England were sold off in 1980 to Fine Fare, with the remaining 67 branches sold to Argyll Foods in 1982. 15 of the Mainstop stores were sold to various chains, with the remaining eight being integrated into International Stores.|$|R
5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch {{was smaller than}} usual in the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government intervention, to which the states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> an Alaska <b>fishery.</b> In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US border. In the winter of 1994, the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations, which was attributed {{in part to the}} fishing ban.|$|R
5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fishery.</b> Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|R
40|$|Markov Decision Processes arise as {{a natural}} model for many {{renewable}} resources allocation problems. In many such problems, high stakes decisions with potentially catastrophic outcomes (such as the collapse of an entire ecosystem) {{need to be taken}} by carefully balancing social, economic, and ecologic goals. We introduce a broad class of such MDP models with a risk averse attitude of the decision maker, in order to obtain policies that are more balanced with respect to the welfare of future generations. We prove that they admit a closed form solution that can be efficiently computed. We show an application of the proposed framework to the Pacific Halibut marine fishery, obtaining new and more cautious policies. Our results strengthen findings of related policies from the literature by providing new evidence that a policy based on periodic <b>closures</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fishery</b> should be employed, in place of the one traditionally used that harvests a constant proportion of the stock every year. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay targeting the rRNA {{internal transcribed spacer}} region of the hard clam pathogen QPX. The qPCR assay was more sensitive than was histology in detecting clams with light QPX infections. QPX was detected in 4 of 43 sediment samples but in none of 40 seawater samples. The thraustochytrid called QPX (for quahog parasite un-known) has caused high mortalities in hatchery-reared and wild hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria, also known as quahogs) from Prince Edward Island (Canada) to Virginia (United States) since the late 1950 s (17, 22, 25, 29). In the summer of 2002, QPX infections appeared in the previously healthy Raritan Bay (off the coast of Staten Island in New York) M. mercenaria popu-lation, causing significant clam mortality and <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fishery</b> (6). Management <b>of</b> hard clam populations affected by QPX disease is hampered by an incomplete understanding of factors controlling the occurrence and severity of QPX infec...|$|R
40|$|The South Georgia {{population}} of mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) is exploited by both a fishery and predators, including gentoo penguins (Pygoscelis papua). Because considerable uncertainty surrounds recent estimates of stock size, {{there is a}} need to consider novel approaches that may give insight into the population dynamics of this species. We derive two indices of recruitment based on the occurrence of mackerel icefish in gentoo penguin diets, one of which is scaled by a survey estimate of the density of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), an alternative prey species for gentoo penguins. The <b>closure</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fishery</b> for much <b>of</b> the 1990 s allowed the relationship between environmental conditions and recruitment to be studied without the confounding effects of fishing mortality. The recruitment indices were positively correlated with sea surface temperature with a lag time equal to the age of the fish. These results suggest strong links between mesoscale environmental processes and the smaller scale interaction between gentoo penguins and their mackerel icefish prey...|$|R
