The effects of some important process factors on the FeO <b>electrolytic</b> <b>reduction</b> with the controlled oxygen flow were discussed.

The reduction for Fe 2 + ions mainly appears on new iron dendrites of the iron crucible cathode, and a very small amount of iron are also formed on the MSZ (2. 18 % MgO partially stabilized zirconia) tube/slag interface due to electronic conductance of MSZ tube.
