5|$|Third Reich {{authorities}} {{disapproved of}} his <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Catholic marriage ceremony, performed by Klawitter. Klawitter had been barred from {{membership in the}} Reichskulturkammer (Reich Culture Chamber) and was considered politically unreliable after a 1936 breach of the Pulpit Law, a remnant of the 1870s Kulturkampf that among other religions barred Catholics from criticizing the state from the pulpit.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of Elizabeth's reign, it was {{expected}} that she would marry and the question arose to whom. Although she received many offers for her hand, she never married and was childless; the reasons for this are not clear. Historians have speculated that Thomas Seymour had put her off sexual relationships, or that she knew herself to be infertile. She considered several suitors until she was about fifty. Her last courtship was with Francis, Duke of Anjou, 22 years her junior. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan {{disagreed}} {{several times}} over the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subject. After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.|$|E
5|$|He {{enlisted in}} the {{military}} and fought in World War I for the 43rd Regiment (Duke of Cornwall’s Own Rifles) as a lieutenant in the 21st Infantry Battalion, starting in May 1915. That December he suffered a knee injury, and was sent to England to recover. He was given the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> posting in Le Havre away from the action, but chose to return to his battalion at the front. He returned to the 21st Battalion in August 1916 for the Battle of the Somme and was killed in action on September 16, 1916 near Courcelette, France. His body was never recovered. His brother Charles died in action in May 1915.|$|E

The <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high muzzle velocity with a relatively lighter shell was taken from the German practice; it ran counter to previous British guns such as the BL 15-inch Mark I gun of 42-calibre length which were lower-muzzle-velocity weapons firing heavy shells.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, {{discussion}} {{started with}} the plans to connect Meland, Flatøy and Lindøy with bridges. This {{was passed by the}} Parliament of Norway in May 1975, and consisted of the Krossnessundet Bridge between Flatøy and Meland, which opened in November 1978. The Hagelsund Bridge opened on 1 April 1982 and connected Flatøy to Lindås and Knarvik, thus also connecting Meland and Lindås. Both bridges were partially financed with tolls. The plans for a pontoon bridge were presented to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications on 31 March 1981. They supported the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pontoon bridge. The decision to construct the bridge was taken by parliament on 9 December 1987, but they demanded that a larger ship channel be constructed.|$|E
5|$|It portrayed Hall as a humourless moralist {{who had a}} {{great deal}} in common with the opponents of her novel.

The game consists of twenty-one levels with objectives which the player must complete before being {{able to continue to}} the next level. There are weapons available in each level and after level three, the player has the use of a lightsaber, along with the Force. In addition to being an effective weapon, the lightsaber is also a useful tool for the player, providing light in dark areas, deflecting incoming blaster fire and cutting through some obstacles.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{previous}} two presidential elections, no candidates were put forward for voters to choose between in 1796. The Constitution provided for the selection of electors who would then elect a president. In seven states voters chose the presidential electors. In the remaining nine states, they were chosen by the state's legislature. The clear favorite of Democratic–Republicans was Jefferson, although he was very reluctant to run. There was little doubt that Adams would be the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{great majority of the}} Federalists. Even so, Hamilton also had hoped to lead the party.|$|E

The Barra 220 V8 engine was available as an option.

In advance of the convention, New York's Republican political boss, Senator Thomas C. Platt, saw an opportunity to politically sideline his state's governor, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, by pushing for his nomination as vice president. Roosevelt accepted the nomination and was elected on McKinley's ticket.|$|E

Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive {{and it makes a}} poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> four-man {{team for}} the {{southern}} journey to the South Pole was largely determined {{by the number of}} surviving ponies. Influenced by his experiences on the Discovery Expedition, he had put his confidence in ponies rather than dogs for the long polar march. The motor car, which ran well on flat ice, could not cope with Barrier surfaces and was not considered for the polar journey. The men chosen by Shackleton to accompany him were Marshall, Adams and Wild. Joyce, whose Antarctic experience exceeded all save Wild's, was excluded from the party after Marshall's medical examination raised doubts about his fitness.|$|E

A now defunct town called Brush Point was the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Dr. Henry Madden and Rufus Colton would have preferred Coltonville, where he made his home.|$|E

As Damien Bol, Jean-Benoit Pilet and Pedro Riera write, {{there is often}} an assumption that the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electoral system {{is closely related to}} the calculations of dominant political parties who select systems that are likely to benefit them in elections. However based on <b>a</b> study <b>of</b> European countries between 1945 and 2011, they illustrate that the <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electoral system can be shaped significantly by the <b>choices</b> <b>of</b> neighbouring/similar states...|$|R

5|$|The {{first and}} second acts deal with the {{attempts}} of the central character, Harry Luckless, to woo his landlady's daughter, and his efforts to make money by writing plays. In the second act, he finishes a puppet theatre play titled The Pleasures of the Town, about the Goddess Nonsense's <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> husband from allegorical representatives of theatre and other literary genres. After its rejection by one theatre, Luckless's play is staged at another. The third act becomes a play within a play, in which {{the characters in the}} puppet play are portrayed by humans. The Author's Farce ends with a merging of the play's and the puppet show's realities.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} many gameplay {{elements of}} the original Final Fantasy VII, including a three-member party structure and adaptations of the game's subsystems. The items, spells and equipment available to the player are based upon those in the original game, and although a large number have been omitted along with optional characters and some side quests, the original story was reproduced in very minute detail. The game was received with mixed reception, cited as an impressive achievement {{but at the same}} time criticized for its difficulty and <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> target console.|$|E
5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, which {{describes how the}} size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient <b>choice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> coordinate system to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E
