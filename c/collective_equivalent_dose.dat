Results of {{systematic}} measurements of radiocaesium activities in milk after the Chernobyl nuclear accident are summarized. 137 Cs fallout activity affects milk activity, {{the coefficient of}} corre-lation being 0. 89. The 137 Cs activities in milk in Croatia are log-normally distributed, reflecting the exponential decrease of activity. After the Chernobyl nuclear accident the 134 Cs: 137 Cs activity ratio in milk was 0. 5, and {{did not differ from}} that for other environmental samples. The dose due to radiocaesium ingestion by milk consumption was estimated for the Croatian population, the annual <b>collective</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> being approximately 205 manSv in 1986 and 1. 5 manSv in 1994.

40|$|Berkeley Lab {{operates}} facilities where radionuclides are produced, handled, stored, {{and potentially}} emitted. These facilities {{are subject to}} the EPA radioactive air emission regulations in 40 CFR 61, Subpart H (EPA 1989 a). Radionuclides may be emitted from stacks or vents on buildings where radionuclide production or use is authorized or they may be emitted as diffuse sources. In 2010, all Berkeley Lab sources were minor sources of radionuclides (sources resulting in a potential dose of less than 0. 1 mrem/yr [0. 001 mSv/yr]). These minor sources included more than 100 stack sources and one source of diffuse emissions. There were no unplanned emissions from the Berkeley Lab site. Emissions from minor sources (stacks and diffuse emissions) were measured by sampling or monitoring or were calculated based on quantities used, received for use, or produced during the year. Using measured and calculated emissions, and building-specific and common parameters, Laboratory personnel applied the EPA-approved computer codes, CAP 88 -PC and COMPLY, to calculate the effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> to the maximally exposed individual (MEI). The effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> from all sources at the Berkeley Lab main site in 2010 was 7. 3 E- 3 mrem/yr (7. 3 E- 5 mSv/yr) to the MEI, well below the 10 mrem/yr (0. 1 mSv/yr) dose standard. The location of this MEI is at the University of California (UC) Lawrence Hall of Science, a public science museum about 1500 ft (460 m) east of Berkeley Lab?s Building 56. The estimated <b>collective</b> effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> to persons living within 50 mi (80 km) of the Berkeley Lab main site was 1. 5 E- 1 person-rem (1. 5 E- 3 person-Sv) attributable to the Lab?s airborne emissions in 2010. The effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> from all sources at Berkeley Lab operations at the Berkeley West Biocenter (Building 977 at 717 Potter Street, Berkeley) in 2010 was 2. 3 E- 4 mrem/yr (2. 3 E- 6 mSv/yr) to the MEI, well below the 10 mrem/yr (0. 1 mSv/yr) dose standard. The location of this MEI is in the Berkeley West Biocenter?s Potter Street building, about 98 ft (30 m) from the point where emissions from Berkeley Lab operations are released. The estimated <b>collective</b> effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> to persons living within 50 mi (80 km) was 9. 8 E- 6 person-rem (9. 8 E- 8 person-Sv) attributable to the Lab?s airborne emissions from Building 977 in 2010. The effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> from all sources at Berkeley Lab operations at the Joint BioEnergy Institute (Building 978 at 5885 Hollis Street, Emeryville) in 2010 was 1. 7 E- 5 mrem/yr (1. 7 E- 7 mSv/yr) to the MEI, well below the 10 mrem/yr (0. 1 mSv/yr) dose standard. The location of this MEI is in the Joint BioEnergy Institute?s Hollis Street building, about 62 ft (19 m) from the point where emissions from Berkeley Lab operations are released. The estimated <b>collective</b> effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> to persons living within 50 mi (80 km) was 6. 4 E- 8 person-rem (6. 4 E- 10 person-Sv) attributable to the Lab?s airborne emissions from Building 978 in 2010...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing an analytical model to calculate leakage neutron <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> in a treatment planning system. Passive scattering proton treatment plans were created for a water phantom and for a patient. For both the phantom and patient, the neutron <b>equivalent</b> <b>doses</b> were small but non-negligible and extended far beyond the therapeutic field. The time required for neutron <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> calculation was 1. 6 times longer than that required for proton dose calculation, with a total calculation time of less than 1 h on one processor for both treatment plans. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to predict neutron <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> distributions using an analytical dose algorithm for individual patients with irregular surfaces and internal tissue heterogeneities. Eventually, personalized estimates of neutron <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> to organs far from the treatment field may guide clinicians to create treatment plans that reduce the risk of late effects...|$|R
