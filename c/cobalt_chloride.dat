40|$|Sodium metal {{chloride}} batteries {{have certain}} distinct advantages over sodium sulfur batteries such as increased safety, inherent overcharge capability and lower operation temperatures. Two systems, i. e., Na/FeCl 2 and Na/NiCl 2 were developed extensively elsewhere and evaluated for various applications including electric vehicles and space. Their performance {{has been very}} encouraging and prompted a detailed fundamental study of these cathodes here at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A brief review of our studies on these new cathode materials is presented here. The initial efforts focussed on the methods of fabrication of the electrodes and their electrochemical characterization. Subsequent studies were aimed at establishing the reaction mechanism, determining the kinetics and identifying the rate limiting processes in the reduction of metal chloride cathodes. Nickel chloride emerged from these studies as the most promising candidate material and was taken up for further detailed study on its passivation - a rate limiting process - under different experimental conditions. Also, the feasibility of using copper chloride, {{which is expected to}} have higher energy density, has been assessed. Based on the criteria established from the voltammetric response of FeCl 2, NiCl 2, and CuCl 2, several other transition metal chlorides were screened.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{preparation}} {{and performance of}} palladium cobalt binary doped silica (PdCoSi) membranes. In view that palladium nitrates precipitate under typical silica 501 -gel synthesis conditions, membranes were prepared via the acid catalysis of tetraethylorthosilane (TEOS) with ethanol, palladium and <b>cobalt</b> <b>chlorides.</b> The largest H- 2 fluxes reached 0. 6 x 10 - 6 mol m(- 2) s(- 1) Pa- 1 at 500 degrees C for H- 2 permeation for the reduced membranes, whilst the best He/N- 2 permselectivies of 70 were observed for the oxidised membranes. The redox effect resulted in membranes with different performance as the reduction increased the total pore volumes of xerogels. However, XPS analysis revealed that palladium monoxide preferentially reduced to metal palladium, whilst reduction was not significant for cobalt oxide. Hence, the reduction to metallic palladium tailored molecular sieving domains through the loss of oxygen. As a result, the permeance of the larger molecular gases CO 2 and N- 2 increased, whilst only a small increase was observed for the smaller molecular gas He. Interestingly, the membranes essentially remained as molecular sieves as evidenced by temperature dependent activated transport and high permselectivities. The molecular sieving domains created preferential pathways for CO 2 and N- 2 permeance, though the silica matrix integrity remained generally intact. Hence, binary and multi doping of metal oxides in silica matrices {{can be used as}} a strategy to attain further functionalities not previously attained by pure silica or single metal oxide doped silica membranes using TEOS as a precursor (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Nanoparticle and nanoparticulate {{films have}} been grown by a unique {{approach}} combining a microwave and nebulized droplets where the concentration {{and thus the}} resulting particle size can be controlled. The goal of such a scalable approach was to achieve it with the least number of steps, and without using expensive high purity chemicals or the precautions necessary to work with such chemicals. This approach was developed {{as a result of}} first using a laser unsuccessfully to achieve the desired films and particles. Some problems with the laser approach for growing desired films were solved by substituting the higher energy microwave for the laser. Additionally, several materials were first attempted to be grown with the laser and the microwave, and what was learned as result of failures was implemented to successfully demonstrate the technique. The microwave system was characterized by using direct temperature measurements and models. Where possible, the temperature of deposition was determined using thermocouples. In the region of the waveguide, the elemental spectral lines were measured, and the temperature was calculated from measured spectral peaks. From the determined temperature, a diffusion calculation modeled the rate of heat transfer to the nebulized droplets. The result of the diffusion calculations explained the reason for the failure of the laser technique, and success for the microwave technique for simple chemistries. The microwave assisted spray pyrolysis (MPAS) technique was used to grow ZnO nanoparticles of varying size. The properties of the different size particles was measured by optical spectroscopy and magnetic measurements and was correlated to the defects created. The MPAS technique was used to grow films of Ca 3 Co 4 O 9 containing varying sizes of nanoparticulates.
