40|$|The {{elevator}} control system {{is one of}} the important aspects in electronics control module in automotive application. Here {{elevator control}} system is designed with different levels. First the elevator control system is implemented for multi-storage building. This implementation is based on FPGA based Fuzzy logic controller for intelligent control of elevator group system. This proposed approach is based on algorithm which is developed {{to reduce the amount of}} computation required by focusing only on relevant rules and ignoring those which are irrelevant to the condition for better performance of the group of elevator system. Here only two inputs are considered i. e. <b>elevator</b> <b>car</b> distance and number of stops. Based on these data the fuzzy controller can calculate the Performance Index (PI) of each <b>elevator</b> <b>car,</b> the car which has maximum PI gives the answer to the hall calls. This would facilitate reducing the Average Waiting Time (AWT) of the passenger. In the second level, the dispatching algorithm is implemented for multi-storage building. Here six types of dispatching algorithms are considered. Based on the traffic situation and condition, one algorithm out of six is operated, that should reduce the Average Waiting Time of passenger and reduce the power consumption of elevator system. The hardware part of the work consists of a simple D. C. Motor, which can control the up and down movement of the <b>elevator</b> <b>car.</b> This D. C. Motor is controlled through the MC 9 S 12 DP 256 B microcontroller. Here four floor elevator systems have been considered and every floor has two switches, one switch is used for up movement and another switch is used for down movement. Based on the switch pressed, the <b>elevator</b> <b>car</b> can move either in upward or downward direction. Here two sensors are used in every floor. One sensor is used for detecting the <b>elevator</b> <b>car</b> when <b>elevator</b> <b>car</b> reached to its destination floor. This sensor detects the car and stops the D. C. Motor. At the same time, another sensor is used for opening and closing the door. Finally, a novel fuzzy based PID controller algorithm is implemented in the MC 9 S 12 dp 256 B microcontroller. This algorithm is mainly used for maintaining the constant speed of D. C. Motor with different load conditions. ...|$|R

50|$|In the atmosphere, {{the risk}} factors of wind and {{lightning}} come into play. The basic mitigation is location. As long as the tether's anchor remains within two degrees of the equator, it {{will remain in the}} quiet zone between the Earth's Hadley cells, where there is relatively little violent weather. Remaining storms could be avoided by moving a floating anchor platform. The lightning risk can be minimized by using a nonconductive fiber with a water-resistant coating to help prevent a conductive buildup from forming. The wind risk can be minimized by use of a fiber with a small cross-sectional area that can rotate with the wind to reduce resistance. Ice forming on the cable also presents a potential problem. It could add significantly to the cable's weight and affect the passage of <b>elevator</b> <b>cars.</b> Also, ice falling from the cable could damage <b>elevator</b> <b>cars</b> or the cable itself. To get rid of ice, special <b>elevator</b> <b>cars</b> could scrape the ice off.|$|R
