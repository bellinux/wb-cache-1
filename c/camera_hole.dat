500|$|Mendes {{encouraged}} some improvisation; for example, when Lester masturbates in {{bed beside}} Carolyn, the director asked Spacey to improvise several euphemisms for the act in each take. Mendes said, [...] "I wanted that {{not just because}} it was funny but because I didn't want it to seem rehearsed. I wanted it to seem like he was blurting it out of his mouth without thinking.

[...] Spacey obliged, eventually coming up with 35 phrases, but Bening could not always keep a straight face, which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times. The production used small amounts of computer-generated imagery. Most of the rose petals in Lester's fantasies were added in post-production, although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed. When Lester fantasizes about Angela in a rose-petal bath, the steam was real, save for in the overhead shot. To position the <b>camera,</b> a <b>hole</b> had to be cut in the ceiling, through which the steam escaped; it was instead added digitally.|$|R

30|$|To {{create the}} normal database, 123 {{subjects}} from the ENC-DAT project {{were used in}} this work [6]. Data was omitted {{if it was not}} acquired on a gamma <b>camera</b> with parallel <b>hole</b> collimators, had no scatter energy windows or had other technical issues. This involved data from 11 different sites and gamma cameras. To assess the diagnostic ability of the normal databases, 77 subjects from two sites (London and Southampton) who had 3 -year follow-up information were used, with their working clinical diagnosis acting as our standard of truth. Of the 77 subjects, 16 subjects were referred for an AD/DLB differential diagnosis, 14 were referred for atypical parkinsonian syndromes while the rest (47) were referred for helping to establish whether the patient had Parkinson’s disease. All patients were scanned according to the protocol defined in [6].|$|R
30|$|CZT cameras possess small {{fields of}} view that are quite {{sensitive}} to heart position [13]. Smaller patients' hearts are more ideally positioned {{in the field of}} view. Additionally, closer proximity to the detector should improve image resolution and count rate for both cameras. Because only CZT cameras scan in direct chest contact, the improved heart-detector proximity due to decreased chest size in smaller patients is proportionately much more significant for CZT than A-SPECT cameras. For the D-SPECT, the center of the circle likely allows all nine DCs to view the heart from the closest average distance. Although D-SPECT uses a parallel hole collimator and Anger <b>camera</b> parallel <b>hole</b> collimator efficiency does not change with distance, D-SPECT sensitivity should decrease with increased distance from the heart. This is because of the size difference between A-SPECT and D-SPECT collimators. The Anger cameras have large detectors where the sensitivity lost per individual collimator-hole is offset by an equal {{increase in the number of}} collimator holes viewing an object as it recedes. Since the D-SPECT's 4 -cm wide DCs do not span the average internal end systolic LV diameter [14], the number of collimator holes exposed to the heart does not increase in step with the decrease in individual collimator hole sensitivity as the object recedes. For the D 530 c, the crosshairs location presumably minimizes average myocardial displacement from the 19 pinhole apertures, since pinhole sensitivity falls with increasing angle and distance [15].|$|R
30|$|For the macro-scale PIV case, various {{models have}} been {{proposed}} to correct the distortions from such changes of optical media. Wieneke proposed a self-calibration scheme where {{the location of the}} laser light sheet was inferred without a calibration target using the disparity map from de-warped images from two stereoscopic cameras [4]. He showed that the Tsai pin <b>hole</b> <b>camera</b> model [5] could accurately model the distortion induced by the planar interface, although the parameters of the model no longer took on physical values. For his proposed self-calibration scheme when the camera system was initially calibrated in air and then self-calibrated in water, he proposed the three interface model of Maas [6] and was able to accurately self-calibrate as long as the distance and misalignment between the window and the light sheet could otherwise be accurately inferred. He also verified that using Tsai’s model along with Maas’ three interface model allowed the Tsai intrinsic parameters to assume physically realistic values.|$|R
40|$|In this response, we {{will weigh}} two dierent {{approaches}} to shape recognition. On {{the one hand}} we have the use of restricted camera models as advocated in the paper of Pizlo et. al. to give a closer approximation to real calibrated cameras. The alternative approach {{is to use a}} full projective camera model and take advantage of the machinery of projective geometry. 1 About the perspective projection Before discussing the usefulness of projective geometry, we revisit perspective projection. A pin <b>hole</b> <b>camera</b> can be modeled as a linear mapping in homogeneous coordinates from the 3 D space onto a plane. Usually this mapping is represented by the product of a rigid motion in space with matrix D, followed by a standard perspective projection expressed as a 3 4 matrix P 0, and nally a rescaling in the image due to the camera parameters represented by a 3 3 matrix K. So the nal projection is represented by a 3 4 matrix P. P = KP...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{by-products}} {{of being}} 3D was {{the importance of}} the camera-handling. Even though most of the levels didn't need complex camera setups, some levels could only be solved if the player was skilled enough to move the camera in the correct way - or by using the Virtual Lemming mode. For example, one level featured a massive indestructible block of wall with the lemmings arriving on top; the only way the player was able to deliver the lemmings to the bottom floor was by digging through a certain part of the block which was left destructible, {{and the only way to}} handle that was to use the VL mode, because the player was unable to fit the <b>camera</b> through the <b>hole.</b> Some levels included rooms or halls where the camera couldn't go into (or come out from) and the player had to peek in through windows or use VL mode.|$|R
50|$|From {{the front}} of the <b>camera,</b> the small <b>hole</b> (the {{aperture}}), would be seen. The virtual image of the aperture as seen from the world is known as the lens's entrance pupil; ideally, all rays of light leaving a point on the object that enter the entrance pupil will be focused to the same point on the image sensor/film (provided the object point is in the field of view). If one were inside the camera, one would see the lens acting as a projector. The virtual image of the aperture from inside the camera is the lens's exit pupil. In this simple case, the aperture, entrance pupil, and exit pupil are all in the same place because the only optical element is in the plane of the aperture, but in general these three will be in different places. Practical photographic lenses include more lens elements. The additional elements allow lens designers to reduce various aberrations, but the principle of operation remains the same: pencils of rays are collected at the entrance pupil and focused down from the exit pupil onto the image plane.|$|R
40|$|People {{tracking}} is {{one major}} part of visual surveillance systems. A number of different people trackers exist nowadays. One of those multi-people trackers is the Reading People Tracker. It consists of four individual co-operating tracking modules. Weaknesses of one module are thereby compensated by the strengths of another one. The Motion Detector performs background-foreground segmentation to extract moving regions. The Region Tracker tracks the regions from the Motion Detector over time. Region merging and splitting helps to overcome problems during motion detection. The Human Feature Detector detects possible head positions in moving regions. But the fundamental tracking module of the Reading People Tracker is the Active Shape Tracker. It uses a 2 D appearance model of human beings, the Active Shape Model. A person’s outlines are represented by an Active Shape which is actually a closed parameterized B-spline curve. An additional feature of the Reading People Tracker is its use of camera calibration to perform image measurements. This diploma thesis evaluates qualitatively and quantitatively the Reading People Tracker. In order to perform the evaluation, a large set of test video sequences is captured. A capturing and calibration environment is implemented to rapidly capture video sequences. Camera calibration is accomplished using Tsai’s perspective pin <b>hole</b> <b>camera</b> model.

40|$|Unsharpness in {{the image}} may reduce the {{visibility}} of details. Magnification is often required to achieve a spatial resolution similar to film technique, when using digital systems. A part of the unsharpness results from the focal spot size. To determine the effective focal spot size, thousands of images with different tubes, energies, magnifications and IQIs from different EN and ASTM standards were taken to evaluate {{the influence of the}} unsharpness in the digital image due to the focal spot. This leads to reference values for the effective focal spot size of the different tubes. These reference values were compared with the values of the pin <b>hole</b> <b>camera</b> images according to EN 12543 - 2 and they deviated significantly. Several modifications of the evaluation method were proposed and a method with Integrated Line Profiles which produces results like an edge profile method was developed and tested providing similar results as the reference values. A second more simple method for end-users was introduced based on the evaluation of Penetrameter hole edges. A proposed update of the standards for focal spot measurements in ASTM and ISO is introduced. New classes will help the users to identify more simple and reliable the X-ray tube for their application...|$|R

Mice in each of four groups were injected with 99 mTc-HYNIC-RGD and imaged 3 or 7 days after FA ligation: WT without diabetes (n = 14), WT with diabetes (n = 14), RAGE-/- without diabetes (n = 16), RAGE-/- with diabetes (n = 14), and five WT without diabetes were injected with control peptide. All mice were injected through the jugular vein catheter with 1 ± 0.2 mCi of 99 mTc-HYNIC-RGD in 0.05 to 0.1 ml (corresponding to 1 μg of peptide) or control peptide. Blood pool clearance was measured in five mice injected with 99 mTc-HYNIC-RGD. By 60 to 75 min after injection, residual blood pool activity was below 10 % of peak.

Popular downstream dirt and dirt and scratch removal systems are PF Clean and Digital ICE.|$|R
40|$|Defects {{associated}} with drilling of Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (CFRPs) are of major economic and safety concerns for aerospace manufacturers. One {{of the most}} critical defects {{associated with}} drilling of CFRP laminates is delamination of layers which can be avoided by keeping the drilling forces below some threshold levels. Orbital Drilling (OD) is an emerging drilling process that exhibits lower cutting forces and temperatures, easier chip removal, higher produced surface quality, longer tool life, and a high possibility for dry machining. The OD process is featured by cyclic engagement and disengagement between the tool and the workpiece whereby a considerable part of the work done by the tool is directed towards the tangential direction while the work done in the axial direction is reduced. This reduces the risk of delamination at the exit. The objective of this research work is to investigate the effect of the OD process key parameters with respect to the produced hole attributes (surface roughness, delamination, and hole accuracy), as well as the cutting forces and temperatures. All the OD tests were performed under dry conditions using a four-flute 6. 35 mm end-mill. The cutting forces were recorded using a 3 -component dynamometer Kistler 9255 B and cutting temperatures were measured using a FLIR ThermoVision A 20 M Infrared <b>camera</b> at the <b>holes</b> exit. A full factorial design of the experiment was used whereby the feeds varied from 60 to 360 mm/min and the speeds from 6, 000 to 16, 000 rpm. The test material used was a quasi-isotropic laminate comprising woven graphite epoxy prepreg. Analysis of the results showed 45 % reduction in the axial force component in orbital drilling (OD), compared to conventional drilling. None of the holes produced by the entire set of experiments has experienced any entry or exit delamination. ANOVA was used to identify the significance of the controllable variables on the experimental outputs. To overcome the challenge of optimizing the competing parameters of the hole quality attributes while maximizing the productivity, an algorithm was applied by hybridizing Kriging as a meta-modeling technique with evolutionary multi-objective optimization to optimize the cutting parameters.

5000|$|Veera {{was born}} in Hyderabad, Southern India. Her father Anjan Babu, is an illustrator, cartoonist, graphic {{designer}} and photo-journalist. Her mother Usha Rani, is a journalist turned banker. At {{the age of three}} Veera started learning sketching from her father, who was an illustrator. She did her schooling from Nasr School, Hyderabad, and was the only child to parents who were both working and much of her early childhood was spent sketching, reading, watching movies and printing photographs with her father in their small private photo studio. Veera's father introduced her to a range of cameras in their studio and she dabbled in making pin <b>hole</b> <b>cameras</b> and other scientific devices, which fascinated her as a child. This would later on influence her distinct visual style. An introvert, shy kid in her childhood, she was raised as a very special and individualistic child by her parents. Both parents loved watching World Cinema, Hollywood classics and Indian Art House. Veera was often taken to watch movies by her father in the local cinemas playing Hollywood films, this was a significant influence in her childhood. David Lean's Doctor Zhivago and the grand epic narratives and adventure films like [...] "Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid" [...] coupled with detective stories and science fiction, which she read avidly, fascinated her immensely. In high school Veera was introduced to the Indian master Satyajit Ray - his films and short stories, which would affect her strongly in her cinematic development. She started watching lot of the World Cinema directors specially French New Wave directors - François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Bresson and Hollywood directors - Alfred Hitchcock, Sidney Pollack, by renting videos and going to small theatres and film clubs in Hyderabad while graduating from college, and was enamored by directors like Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Tarkovsky and Luis Buñuel. She graduated in Science (St. Ann's College Hyderabad) and was a bright student, however she decided to discontinue her education in science and pursue her ultimate passion for cinema. After a brief stint in M.A Theatre Arts, Central University Hyderabad (1999) and acting in plays she joined the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune, the prestigious national film institute in India. She graduated in Film Direction.|$|R
