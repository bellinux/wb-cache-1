5000|$|In July 2011 Missouri lawmakers {{passed the}} Amy Hestir Student Protection Act which {{included}} a provision that barred K-12 teachers from using websites that allow [...] "exclusive access" [...] in communications with <b>current</b> students <b>or</b> <b>former</b> students who are 18 or younger, such as occurs with private messages on sites such as Facebook. A circuit court order issued before the law went into effect blocked the provision because [...] "the breadth of the prohibition is staggering" [...] and the law [...] "would have a chilling effect" [...] on free-speech rights guaranteed under the US Constitution. In September the legislature replaced the controversial provision with a requirement that local school districts develop their own policies {{on the use of}} electronic communication between employees and students.|$|R

5|$|In {{the late}} spring of 1971, she began dating Bill Clinton, {{who was also a}} law student at Yale. During the summer, she interned at the Oakland, California, law firm of Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein. The firm was well known for its support of {{constitutional}} rights, civil liberties and radical causes (two of its four partners were <b>current</b> <b>or</b> <b>former</b> Communist Party members); Rodham worked on child custody and other cases. Clinton canceled his original summer plans in order to live with her in California; the couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school. The following summer, Rodham and Clinton campaigned in Texas for unsuccessful 1972 Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern. She received a Juris Doctor degree from Yale in 1973, having stayed on an extra year to be with Clinton. He first proposed marriage to her following graduation but she declined, uncertain if she wanted to tie her future to his.|$|E

5000|$|In {{parallel}} to the Staatsministerium, Stein planned {{the creation of a}} Staatsrat or Privy Council. However, he had had no opportunity to set up a correctly functioning one by 1808 and it was Hardenberg who set it up in 1810. The text of the relevant law stated: [...] The members of the Council of State had to be <b>current</b> ministers <b>or</b> <b>former</b> ministers, high-level civil servants, princes of the royal house or figures nominated by the king. A commission was also formed to function as a kind of parliament, with major legislative rights. As a bastion of the bureaucracy, the Council of State had to prevent any return to absolutism or any moves to reinforce the interests of the Ancien Régime. The Council of State also had to subroge all laws and administrative and constitutional procedures.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the relationship between school performance, smoking, and quitting attempts among teenagers. METHODS: A logistic regression model was used to predict the probability of being a <b>current</b> smoker <b>or</b> a <b>former</b> smoker. Data were derived from the 1990 California Youth Tobacco Survey. RESULTS: Students' school performance was a key factor in predicting smoking and quitting attempts when other sociodemographic and family income factors were controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Developing academic or remedial classes designed to improve students' school performance may lead to a reduction in smoking rates among teenagers while simultaneously providing a human capital investment in their futures...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that an early mega-impact event might explain the fumdamental crustal dichotomy on Mars. Detailed morphological mapping of the structures which characterize the boundary between the cratered highlands and northern plains does not support this idea: the distribution of these features along and especially away from the boundary is more consistent with a larger number of smaller but overlapping impacts. A data base was assembled {{for the study of the}} highland boundary through quantitative mapping (including crater counts) based on the 1 : 2 M controlled photomosaics. Whole and partial craters larger than 10 km in diameter, knobby terrain, detached plateaus and intervening plains-forming units have been identified wherever they occur on Mars between + 65 and - 45 deg latitude. There is evidence for occurrences of possible old cratered terrain (or its remanents) at high latitudes well north of the <b>current</b> <b>or</b> likely <b>former</b> location of the proposed Borealis Basin rim which are difficult to reconcile with an impact structure of the proposed size and location...|$|R
