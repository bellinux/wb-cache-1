Ever {{since the}} Clementine and Lunar Prospector mission {{instrument}} data indicated {{the possibility of}} significant concentrations of hydrogen at the lunar poles, speculation on the form and concentration of the hydrogen has been debated.

40|$|The Space Exploration Policy {{enacted by}} the US Congress in 2005 calls for the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to {{implement}} a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore {{the solar system and}} beyond; Extend human presence across the solar system, starting with a human return to the Moon by the year 2020, in preparation for human exploration of Mars and other destinations; Develop the innovative technologies, knowledge, and infrastructures both to explore and to support decisions about the destinations for human exploration; and Promote international and commercial participation in exploration to further U. S. scientific, security, and economic interests. In 2006, NASA released the Lunar Architecture Study, which proposed establishing a lunar Outpost on the Moon with international participation to extend human presence beyond Earth's orbit, pursue scientific activities, use the Moon to prepare for future human missions to Mars, and expand Earth s economic sphere. The establishment of sustained human presence on the Moon for science and exploration combines the design, integration, and operation challenges experienced from both the short Apollo lunar missions and the build-up and sustained crew operations of the International Space Station (ISS). Apollo experience reminds developers and mission planners that hardware must operate under extremely harsh environmental and abrasive conditions and every kilogram of mass and payload must be critical to achieve the mission s objectives due to the difficulty and cost of reaching the lunar surface. Experience from the ISS reminds developers and mission planners that integration of all hardware must be designed and planned {{from the start of the}} program, operations and evolution of capabilities on a continuous basis are important, and long-term life-cycle costs and logistical needs are equally or more important than minimizing early development and test costs. Overarching all of this is the need to implement efforts that are sustainable and affordable. One area NASA is developing that can significantly change how systems required for sustained human presence are designed and integrated, as well as potentially break our reliance on Earth supplied logistics, is In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). ISRU, also known living off the land, involves the extraction and processing of local resources into useful products. In particular, the ability to make propellants, life support <b>consumables,</b> <b>fuel</b> cell reagents, and radiation shielding can significantly reduce the cost, mass, and risk of sustained human activities beyond Earth. Also, the ability to modify the lunar landscape for safer landing, transfer of payloads from the lander an outpost, dust generation mitigation, and infrastructure placement and buildup are also extremely important for long-term lunar operations. While extra-terrestrial excavation, material handling and processing, and site preparation and construction may be new to NASA and other space agencies, there is extensive terrestrial hardware and commercial experience that can be leveraged. This paper will provide an overview of current NASA activities in lunar ISRU mining and construction and how terrestrial experience in these areas are important to achieving the goal of affordable and sustainable human exploration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Naval Battle Group Supply (NBGS) {{model is}} a dynamic and {{stochastic}} representation of the supply of U. S. Navy battle groups (BGs) worldwide by its combat logistics forces. The model measures the Navy‟s capability to provide logistics support for critical <b>consumables</b> (ship <b>fuel,</b> aviation fuel, dry goods, and ammunition). Execution of the model provides key system performance measures such as total distances traveled and various service levels, e. g. time combat forces operate below a critical supply level. Information from the model is used to more effectively design supply ships, in terms of sizing and capabilities, and to test and evaluate alternative operating policies. The model considers the supply and resupply of consumables as BGs and supply ships (SSs) carry out operations worldwide. Consumption by BGs, which depends on distances traveled and type of activity, is considered both within theaters of operation and in transit between theater and homeport. Once a BG indicates {{a need for a}} consumable, an SS is dispatched to rendezvous with the BG and transfers the material at a model-determined location. Force needs and demand for materials within theaters change based on stochastic actions, e. g. combat, show of force, humanitarian assistance. In order to meet changing force needs, BGs may be pulled from other theaters or from homeport. The model also considers the resupply of supply ships at friendly ports. All combat group and supply ship operational parameter values are populated in the model through a linked database.

The extraction and processing of space resources into useful products, known as In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), can have a substantial impact on mission and architecture concepts. In particular, the ability to make propellants, life support <b>consumables,</b> and <b>fuel</b> cell reagents can significantly reduce the cost, mass, and risk of sustained human activities beyond Earth. Potential lunar resources include solar wind implanted volatiles, vast quantities of metal and mineral oxides, possible water/ice at the poles, abundant solar energy, regions of permanent light and darkness, the vacuum of space itself, and even scavenging leftover descent propellants and/or trash and waste from human crew activities. Suitable processing can transform these raw resources into useful materials and products. The establishment of a human lunar Outpost, as proposed by NASA at the 2 nd Space Exploration Conference in Houston in December 2006, opens up the possibility for the first time of breaking our reliance on Earth supplied consumables and learn to "live off the land".

40|$|The {{utilization}} of CO 2 to produce life support consumables, such as O 2 and H 2 O, via the Sabatier reaction {{is an important}} aspect of NASA s cabin Atmosphere Revitalization System and In-Situ Resource Utilization architectures for both low-earth orbit and long-term manned space missions. In the current International Space Station (ISS) and other low orbit missions, metabolically-generated CO 2 is removed from the cabin air and vented into space, resulting in a net loss of O 2. This requires a continuous resupply of O 2 via water electrolysis, and thus highlights the need for large water storage capacity. For long-duration space missions, the amount of life support consumables is limited and resupply options are practically nonexistent, thus atmosphere resource management and recycle becomes crucial to significantly reduce necessary O 2 and H 2 O storage. Additionally, the potential use of the Martian CO 2 -rich atmosphere and Lunar regolith to generate life support <b>consumables</b> and propellant <b>fuels</b> is of interest to NASA. Precision Combustion, Inc.

40|$|Today, humans explore deep-space {{locations}} such as Mars, asteroids, and beyond, vicariously here on Earth, with noteworthy success. However, {{to achieve}} the revolutionary breakthroughs that have punctuated {{the history of science}} since the dawn of the Space Age has always required humans as "the discoverers," as Daniel Boorstin contends in this book of the same name. During Apollo 17, human explorers on the lunar surface discovered the "genesis rock," orange glass, and humans in space revamped the optically crippled Hubble Space Telescope to enable some of the greatest astronomical discoveries of all time. Science-driven human exploration is about developing the opportunities for such events, perhaps associated with challenging problems such as whether we can identify life beyond Earth within the universe. At issue, however, is how to safely insert humans and the spaceflight systems required to allow humans to operate as they do best in the hostile environment of deep space. The first issue is minimizing the problems associated with human adaptation to the most challenging aspects of deep space space radiation and microgravity (or non-Earth gravity). One solution path is to develop technologies that allow for minimization of the exposure time of people to deep space, as was accomplished in Apollo. For a mission to the planet Mars, this might entail new technological solutions for in-space propulsion that would make possible time-minimized transfers to and from Mars. The problem of rapid, reliable in-space transportation is challenged by the celestial mechanics of moving in space and the so-called "rocket equation. " To travel to Mars from Earth in less than the time fuel-minimizing trajectories allow (i. e., Hohmann transfers) requires an exponential increase in the amount of fuel. Thus, month-long transits would require a mass of fuel as large as the dry mass of the ISS, assuming the existence of continuous acceleration engines. This raises the largest technological stumbling block to moving humans on site as deep-space explorers, delivering the masses required for human spaceflight systems to LEO or other Earth orbital vantage points using the existing or projected fleet of Earth-to-orbit (ETO) launch vehicles. Without a return to Saturn V-class boosters or an alternate path, one cannot imagine emplacing the masses that would be required for any deep-space voyage without a prohibitive number of Shuttle-class launches. One futurist solution might involve mass launch systems {{that could be used to}} move the <b>consumables,</b> including <b>fuel,</b> water, food, and building materials, to LEO in pieces rather than launching integrated systems.

One area that opens up the possibility {{for the first time}} of breaking our reliance on Earth supplied consumables and learn to live off the land is In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). ISRU, which involves the extraction and processing of space resources into useful products, can have a substantial impact on mission and architecture concepts. In particular, the ability to make propellants, life support <b>consumables,</b> and <b>fuel</b> cell reagents can significantly reduce the cost, mass, and risk of sustained human activities beyond Earth. However, ISRU is an unproven capability for human lunar exploration and can not be put in the critical path of lunar Outpost success until it has been proven. Therefore, ISRU development and deployment needs to take incremental steps toward the desired end state. To ensure ISRU capabilities are available for pre-Outpost and Outpost deployment by 2020, and mission and architecture planners are confident that ISRU can meet initial and long term mission requirements, the ISRU Project is developing technologies and systems in three critical areas: (1) Regolith Excavation, Handling and Material Transportation; (2) Oxygen Extraction from Regolith; and (3) Volatile Extraction and Resource Prospecting, and in four development stages: (I) Demonstrate feasibility; (II) Evolve system w/ improved technologies; (III) Develop one or more systems to TRL 6 before start of flight development; and (IV) Flight development for Outpost. To minimize cost and ensure that ISRU technologies, systems, and functions are integrated properly into the Outpost, technology development efforts are being coordinated with other development areas such as Surface Mobility, Surface Power, Life Support, EVA, and Propulsion. Lastly, laboratory and field system-level tests and demonstrations will be performed as often as possible to demonstrate improvements in: Capabilities (ex. digging deeper); Performance (ex. lower power); and Duration (ex. more autonomy or more robustness). This presentation will provide the status of work performed to date within the NASA ISRU project with respect to technology and system development and field demonstration activities, as well as the current strategy to implement ISRU in future robotic and human lunar exploration missions...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} inert C-H bond {{activation}} of hydrocarbons {{has been gaining}} interest. As these hydrocarbons {{are used in the}} production of many <b>consumables</b> such as <b>fuel,</b> plastics, and detergents, it is necessary to efficiently utilize the finite quantity of petroleum feedstocks. Transition metal complexes are incorporated as catalysts into synthetic routes to create new C-X (X = C, N, O) bonds in order to increase the chemical value of organic molecules. The complex [Ru(η 6 -p-cymene) {P(OCH 2 CF 3) 3 }(Ph) (OTf) ] (1) (P{OCH 2 CF 3 } 3 = tris(2, 2, 2 -trifluoroethyl) phosphite, Ph = phenyl, OTf = trifluoromethanesulfonate) was prepared and tested for functionality as a catalyst in olefin hydroarylation. Catalytic reactions were attempted with 5 mol % of 1 in ethylene (15 psi) and benzene-d 6 at a varying temperatures, which resulted in the decomposition of 1 and no formation of an organic product. With the observed decomposition of the complex in catalytic attempts, three different directions were pursued: the coordination of ligands 1, 4, 7 -trimethyl- 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane (9 N 3 Me) and 1, 4, 7 -trithiacyclononane (9 S 3) to complex 1 to replace η 6 -p-cymene as the ancillary ligand, the synthesis of a Ru(η 6 -p-cymene) complex that had the caged phosphite ligand trimethylolpropane phosphite {P(OCH 2) 3 CEt} coordinated, and the synthesis of Ru complexes containing the anionic ancillary ligand pentamethylcyclopentadiene (Cp*). The ligands 9 S 3 and 9 N 3 Me did not coordinate to complex 1. The new complex [Ru(η 6 -p-cymene) {P(OCH 2) 3 CEt}{Ph) (Cl) ] (2) was synthesized. The new complex [Ru(Cp*) {P(OCH 2 CF 3) 3 } 2 (Cl) 3 was synthesized, characterized, and reactivity with AgOTf, AgOAc, PhMgBr, PhLi, and MeLi have been tested (AgOAc = silver acetate) ...|$|R
