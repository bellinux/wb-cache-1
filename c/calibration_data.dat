40|$|The Soumi NPP VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) {{nighttime}} imagery {{quality is}} affected by stray light contamination. In this study, we {{examined the relationship between}} the Earth scene stray light and the signals in VIIRS’s calibrators to better understand stray light characteristics and to improve upon the current correction method. Our analyses showed the calibrator signal to be highly predictive of Earth scene stray light and can provide additional stray light characteristics that are difficult to obtain from Earth scene data alone. In the current stray light correction regions (mid-to-high latitude), the stray light onset angles can be tracked by <b>calibration</b> view <b>data</b> to reduce correction biases. In the southern hemisphere, it is possible to identify the angular extent of the additional stray light feature in the <b>calibration</b> view <b>data</b> and develop a revised correction method to remove the additional stray light occurring during the southern hemisphere springtime. Outside of current stray light correction region, the analysis of <b>calibration</b> view <b>data</b> indicated occasional stray light contamination at low latitude and possible background biases caused by Moon illumination. As stray light affects a significant portion of nighttime scenes, further refinement in characterization and correction is important to ensure VIIRS DNB imagery quality for Soumi NPP and future missions...|$|R

50|$|Following launch on January 7, 1998 UT (6 January EST) {{aboard a}} four-stage Athena II rocket, Lunar Prospector had a 105-hour cruise to the Moon. During the cruise, the three {{instrument}} booms were deployed. The MAG and APS collected <b>calibration</b> <b>data,</b> while the GRS, NS, and ER outgassed for one day, {{after which they}} also collected <b>calibration</b> <b>data</b> in cis-lunar space. The craft was inserted into an 11.6-hour period capture orbit about the Moon {{at the end of}} the cruise phase. After 24 hours Lunar Prospector was inserted into a 3.5-hour period intermediate orbit, followed 24 hours later (on January 13, 1998) by transfer into a 92 x 153 km preliminary mapping orbit, and then on 16 January by insertion into the near-circular 100 km altitude nominal lunar polar mapping orbit with an inclination of 90 degrees and a period of 118 minutes. Lunar <b>calibration</b> <b>data</b> was collected during the 11.6- and 3.5-hour orbits. Lunar mapping data collection started shortly after the 118 minute orbit was achieved. The data collection was periodically interrupted during the mission as planned for orbital maintenance burns, which took place to recircularize the orbit whenever the periselene or aposelene was more than 20 km to 25 km from the 100 km nominal orbit; this occurred about once a month. On December 19, 1998, a maneuver lowered the orbit to 40 km to perform higher resolution studies. The orbit was altered again on 28 January to a 15 x 45 km orbit, ending the one year primary mission and beginning the extended mission.|$|E
