40|$|This project {{deals with}} the use of twisted GI wires as passive heat {{transfer}} augmentation device. Effect of twisted GI wires without <b>baffles</b> and <b>with</b> <b>baffles,</b> <b>with</b> varying <b>baffle</b> spacing, was studied experimentally in a double pipe heat exchanger. Effect of insert <b>with</b> three different <b>baffle</b> spacing (24 cm, 12 cm, 6 cm) were studied. The effect of turbulence created by twisted wires & baffles on Nusselt number was compared with that of smooth tube. Based on constant flow rate, the nusselt numbers were found to be 1. 23 - 1. 42, 1. 32 - 1. 5 & 1. 49 - 1. 65 times the smooth tube values for baffle spacing of 24 cm, 12 cm and 6 cm respectively. Based on increase in nusselt number and performance evaluation of inserts <b>with</b> different <b>baffle</b> spacing, it was concluded that insert <b>with</b> <b>baffle</b> spacing 6 cm performs much better than the inserts <b>with</b> <b>baffle</b> spacing 12 cm or 24 cm or without baffles. Continuous research is going on to improve its effectiveness by increasing fluid turbulence, generating secondary flow patterns, reducing the thermal resistance and increasing the heat transfer surface area...|$|R

Heat exchange process which is daily used in industries in which energy takes one form to other. This project deals {{with the introduction of}} Circular [MS] rods as inserts as passive augmentation device, in the flow path of inner tube side of liquid flow. The impact of turbulence on heat Transfer was compared with the values for smooth tube. The impact of baffles was also taken into account and again a comparative study was {{made on the basis of}} varying the baffle spacing. All the outcomes and readings were contrasted and the standard information from the smooth tube. Two Circular Rods (di = 8 mm, 10 mm) were used for the experimental purpose.
