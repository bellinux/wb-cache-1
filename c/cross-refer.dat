30|$|Epistemic {{governance}} and epistemic innovation policy formulate a critique against too-narrowly defined approaches to governance, where governance follows one-sidedly bureaucratic or technocratic considerations. Instead, epistemic governance (also quality management and quality enhancement) and epistemic innovation {{policy should be}} regarded as a plea for a more comprehensive understanding, where the explicit-making, comprehension and reflection of knowledge, knowledge production, and knowledge application are keys for a successful governing and governance. For the further progress of advanced knowledge society, advanced knowledge economy, and advanced knowledge democracy, universities and the higher education sectors are crucial for driving development. How should the governance of higher education, the quality enhancement of universities, and the careers of academic faculty (the academic profession) be organized? Epistemic governance introduces here a novel approach and understanding. Epistemic governance emphasizes that the underlying epistemic structure, the underlying epistemic base, or the underlying epistemic paradigms (knowledge paradigms) of those organizations, institutions, or systems (sectors), which should be governed, are being addressed. This defines a benchmark and set of criteria for internal and external governance in higher education that is interested in applying a good, effective, and sustainable governance. Quality assurance, quality enhancement, and quality management of higher education, from the perspective of epistemic governance, should also orient themselves to quality and quality dimensions that <b>cross-refer</b> to the underlying epistemic structure of higher education. In a traditional understanding, the academic career patterns of the academic core faculty at universities follow a tenure-track logic. Cross-employment (multi-employment), on the contrary, refers to academic faculty (the academic profession) with simultaneous employment contracts to more than one organization only within or both inside and outside of higher education. Epistemic governance, in combination with crossemployment, should add to the organizational flexibility and creativity of universities and other higher education institutions, supporting the integration of a pluralism and diversity of knowledge production (basic research in the context of knowledge application and innovation), the formation of nonlinear innovation networks, and providing a rationale for a new type of academic career model.|$|E

Results: By utilizing literature cross-reference information provided by NCBI Entrez Gene database, {{we found that the}} coverage of gene/protein databases with respect to gene/protein names found in text is around 94 %. The upper bound of the recall in retrieving MEDLINE citations by gene/protein names is around 70 - 80 % when citations crossreferred by many genes are overlooked and flexible matching of names are used. Of genes/proteins failed to be retrieved by names, over 30 % are caused by citations not discussing <b>cross-referred</b> genes/proteins in the abstracts and around 60 % are caused by the gene/protein name tagging system trained on the BioCreAtIvE II gene mention corpus. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that existing gene/protein databases have a decent coverage of gene/protein names used in MEDLINE abstracts. Approaches and data resources for gene/protein tagging and mapping need to be selected appropriately for individual practical tasks. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Kitzur became {{immensely popular}} after its {{publication}} {{due to its}} simplicity, and is still popular within Orthodox Judaism, {{as a framework for}} study. Many other works - Ben Ish Hai, Chayei Adam and others - are also concise, and suitable for laypersons or summaries of the Shulchan Aruch but did not reach the level of the Kitzur's popularity. [...] "The Kitzur" [...] is not a basis for making Halakhic decisions; rather, Rabbis will use the Shulchan Aruch (including the various commentaries), or later works such as Kaf HaChaim or the Mishnah Berurah. Because of this popularity it is often printed with cross-references to other works of halakha, especially the Shulchan Aruch HaRav or the Mishnah Berurah; one popular edition also contains notes by former Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu entitled Darkhe Halakhah <b>cross-referring</b> to leading Sephardi authorities.

A recent commentary is Shearim Metzuyanim be-Halakhah, by Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Braun, which examines contemporary problems {{in the light of the}} work. Ganzfried himself, however, stated that there should be no commentaries on his work, since its point, as indicated by its title, was that it should remain short - and that such commentaries should be appended to the Shulchan Aruch itself, rather than to the Kitzur.

Kinetic studies resulting in a plot of paraoxon versus diazoxon hydrolysis rates may be used to accurately predict PON 1192 geno-type. In this study, paraoxonase and diazoxonase activities in plasma were measured spec-trophotometrically using plasma while PCR-based PON 1192 genotyping was performed us-ing polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction digestion. The two-substrate assay-derived genotypes were <b>cross-referred</b> with those determined by PCR-based genotyping. When results did not concur, sequencing of the 99 -bp region spanning codon 192 of PON 1 was performed to verify the genotype. Concordant samples with high or low activities were sequenced for comparison. In addition, the rare PON 1194 WX polymorphism was examined as a source of discordance. The frequency of the PON 1192 Q allele in a Malaysian population comprising three ethnic groups (Malays, Chinese and Indians) was estimated to be 0. 46, and that of the PON 1192 R allele, 0. 54. Discordance between the genotype and phenotype was ob-served for two samples. One of the two subjects genotyped as PON 1192 QR and phenotyped as PON 1192 QQ. The sample showed low paraoxonase and diazoxonase activities. Sequencing confirmed that the genotype was PON 1192 QR. The other subject was genotyped as PON 1192 RR but phenotyped as PON 1192 QR.

This material and information drawn from caste genealogists, is <b>cross-referred</b> to the historical records of the district, combining to offer insight into a regional trade that archaeologists suggest goes back about four thousand years. Cloth and Community offers a micro-history of local trade in a primary textile-producing area. Uniquely, the voices of contemporary makers and their clients are set in historical perspective through the use of oral history and archival records. This contrasts with the existing literature which preferences the export trade (Irwin and Hall 1971; Gittinger 1982). “Cloth and community” draws on interviews over sixteen years with dyers and printers, and with their customers in Kachchh district. Analysis of field notes and interviews has been combined with archival research in India and the UK. Abstract The Khatris are an hereditary caste of dyers and block-printers in Kachchh district, Gujarat. This article reviews the traditional market for the Khatris' textiles, discussing in detail items made for specific client castes, chiefly the farmers and herders of Kachchh. It analyzes factors that have affected this traditional market in the post-colonial period, such as the wholesale industrialization of manufacture and changing patterns of agriculture.

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{discipline of}} the study is the sociolinguistics of law in which the analytical methods of discourse, genre and narrative analysis are brought together in the enterprise of describing language in its social context. The issues addressed in this study relate to communication processes {{in a court of law}} in Gaborone, Botswana. These have been identified as issues relating to the various stages of the trial process that some writers have labelled sub-genres of the courtroom genre and some have simply labelled discourses. The process typical to the Botswana courtroom are the administrative processes of Mentions Reading of Charge Sheets and Readings of Facts and the substantive processes of Direct and Cross Examinations, Submissions and Judgements. The study also includes the description of the bilingual nature of the Botswana courtroom including code switching and courtroom interpreting. The views and awareness of the legal practitioners - police prosecutors and lawyers - on and of the uses of language in the courtroom were sought and tested by a short questionnaire. These are <b>cross-referred</b> with observations and recordings of the court's proceedings with the aim of revealing the nature of bilingualism in this court. Many studies have described and critique different aspects of the trial such as courtroom questioning and jury summations, but few have attempted to describe the trial as a whole as this study has done. This broad focus has enabled the perception of the trial as a site for interlocking discourses, which together bring about the outcomes of trials. It has found out, for example, that while some processes are, ordinarily, unacceptably coercive of witness, like cross examinations, some are empowering, for instance, direct examinations. In which witnesses are allowed longer turns at talk where they give narrative accounts.
