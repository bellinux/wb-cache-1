40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the efficacy <b>of</b> radon <b>remedial</b> <b>action</b> in a school on the Ischia island, South Italy, affected by indoor radon concentration higher than the value of 500 Bq/m 3. This value is the limit imposed by the Italian legislation, to above which corrective actions in schools are necessary. Before the application <b>of</b> <b>remedial</b> <b>action,</b> indoor radon concentrations were measured in 9 rooms of the school. The measurements were performed with LR- 115 passive alpha detectors (SSNTDs) and E-Perm. The <b>remedial</b> <b>action</b> was conducted in one of the office affected by high radon concentration using a Radonstop paint applied after the construction of a concrete slab under the floor. The effect <b>of</b> <b>remedial</b> <b>action</b> was the reduction of the concentration of radon of 41 % and moreover it has demonstrated to be durable over time. The chosen method is cheap and easy to apply and it could be designed for various types of building. This method can be applied to new and existing buildings that show high dose values...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Faults in {{automated}} processes will often cause undesired reactions and shut-down of a controlled plant, {{and the consequences}} could be damage to the plant, to personnel or the environment. Fault-tolerant control is the synonym {{for a set of}} recent techniques that were developed to increase plant availability and reduce the risk of safety hazards. Its aim is to prevent that simple faults develop into serious failure. Fault-tolerant control merges several disciplines to achieve this goal, including on-line fault diagnosis, automatic condition assessment and calculation <b>of</b> <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> when a fault is detected. The envelope <b>of</b> the possible <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> is wide.
