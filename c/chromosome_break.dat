A gene contains a code for a protein and if the gene is mutated (different from normal) the protein that is made from it may not function properly - if at all. Unfortunately, genetic abnormalities could still exist despite having normal chromosomes. The only way to determine genetically inherited mutations in the infant is to perform a genetic analysis of the mother, father, affected infant and any unaffected siblings of the affected fetus. These analyses will reveal what genetic mutations are present in the affected infant, and by comparing these results to the surviving siblings and parents, it can be determined which mutations were inherited or were not.|$|E
5000|$|Gene {{amplification}} is {{the increase}} in copy number of a region of a chromosome. Such events occur frequently in solid tumors, and can contribute to tumor evolution through altered gene expression. Initiation of gene amplification occurs {{on the basis of}} genome instability. Research on Chinese hamster cells showed that amplifications in the DHFR gene (involved in DNA synthesis) began with <b>chromosome</b> <b>break</b> in distal areas to the gene, and subsequent cycles of bridge-breakage-fusion formations result in large intrachromosomal repeats. The over amplification of oncogenes can occur in response to drug administration, and this is thought to be the underlying mechanism in several classes of resistance. For example, DHFR amplification occurs in response to methotrexate, TYMS (involved in DNA synthesis) amplification occurs in response to 5-fluorouracil, and BCR-ABL amplification occurs in response to imatinib mesylate. Determining areas of gene amplification in patients using sequencing techniques has huge clinical implications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere are {{two types}} of {{chromosome}} instability, structural and numerical, and these are important in cancer. Many structural abnormalities are likely to involve double-strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks. Nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination are the major pathways for repairing dsDNA breaks. NHEJ is the primary pathway for repairing dsDNA breaks throughout the G 0, G 1 and early S phases of the cell cycle [1]. Ku 86 and DNA ligase IV are two major proteins in the NHEJ pathway. We examined primary dermal fibroblasts from mice (wild type, Ku 86 +/−, Ku 86 −/−, and DNA ligase IV+/−) for <b>chromosome</b> <b>breaks.</b> Fibroblasts from Ku 86 +/− or DNA ligase IV+/− mice have elevated frequencies of <b>chromosome</b> <b>breaks</b> compared with those from wild-type mice.

50|$|The ETV6 gene (also {{known as}} translocation-Ets-leukemia) {{is a member}} of the ETS {{transcription}} factor family. The gene codes for a transcription factor protein, ETV6, which acts to inhibit the expression of various genes which in mice appear to be required for normal hematopoiesis and the development and maintenance of the vascular network. The gene is located on human chromosome 12 at position p13.2 and is well-known to be involved in a large number of chromosomal rearrangements associated with leukemia and congenital fibrosarcoma. Heterozygous ETV6 germline mutations have been identified in several families with inherited thrombocytopenia, variable red blood cell macrocytosis, and hematologic malignancies, primarily B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The ACSL6 gene encodes a protein, CSL6 acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 6 (or ACSL6 protein). This protein is a Long-chain-fatty-acid—CoA ligase that plays a major role in fatty acid metabolism (particularly in the brain) by charging fatty acids with Coenzyme A to form acyl-CoA. This function can not only alter fatty acid metabolism but also modulate the function of protein kinase Cs and nuclear thyroid hormone receptor. The gene is located on human chromosome 5 at position q31.1. Chromosome translocations between ETV6 and ACSL6 at different <b>chromosome</b> <b>break</b> points create various t(5:12)(q31;p13) ETV6-ACSL6 fusion genes encoding ETV6-ACSL6 fusion proteins. The functionality of ETV6-ACSL6 fusion proteins and the mechanism by which they promote clonal hypereosinophil may, based on indirect evidence in 5 case studies, relate to a lose or gain in function of the ETV6 portion of the fusion protein. However, these issues have not been fully investigated or defined. Two cases involving ETV6-ACSL6 fusion genes were associated with the ectopic and uncontrolled expression of Interleukin 3. The gene for interleukin 3 is close to the ACSL6 gene at position 5q31 and could also be mutated during at least some ETV6-ACSL6 translocation events. Interleukin 3 stimulates the activation, growth, and survival of eosinophils and therefore its mutation could be involved in the clonal hypereosinophilia occurring in ETV6-ACSL6-related disease.|$|E

The region close to the breakpoint (i. e., cry 1) is unusually active in recombination. About 20 % of the intact homologues remaining after chromosome loss were gene-converted for cry 1. In addition, the broken end participated in reciprocal recombination events that joined the chromosome to the distal portion of the intact homologous chromosome. ——The unstable diploids may also become stable and no longer give rise to mitotic segregants. We have found two distinct ways in which stabilization occurs.

In one of 9 cases so far analyzed, the stable diploid was still hemizygous for MATα and for other markers distal to MAT.

50|$|Chiasma {{formation}} {{is common in}} meiosis, where two homologous <b>chromosomes</b> <b>break</b> and rejoin, leading to chromosomes that are hybrids of the parental types. It can also occur during mitosis but {{at a much lower}} frequency because the chromosomes do not pair in a regular arrangement. Nevertheless, the result will be the same when it does occur—the recombination of genes.|$|R
