5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{accession}} to the throne, Sviatoslav began campaigning to expand Rus' {{control over the}} Volga valley and the Pontic steppe region. His greatest success was the conquest of Khazaria, which for centuries {{had been one of}} the strongest states of Eastern Europe. The sources are not <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> roots of the conflict between Khazaria and Rus', so several possibilities have been suggested. The Rus' had an interest in removing the Khazar hold on the Volga trade route because the Khazars collected duties from the goods transported by the Volga. Historians have suggested that the Byzantine Empire may have incited the Rus' against the Khazars, who fell out with the Byzantines after the persecutions of the Jews in the reign of Romanus I Lecapenus.|$|E

25|$|No {{national}} club championship existed then in Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia and Bolivia. As for Ecuador, Emelec, the Guayaquil League {{champion of}} 1946 (no league was held there in 1947) was given preference over the Quito League Champion as the 1947 South American Championship matches were held all at Emelec's stadium (Estadio George Capwell) and having Emelec's as {{the cornerstone of}} Ecuador's national team squad. As for Brazil, the champion of Rio de Janeiro state, Vasco da Gama represented Brazil. They were given preference over Palmeiras, the São Paulo state champion, since Rio won the 1946 Championship of State Teams and thus was considered the champion of the stronger league. As for Bolivia, the country was represented by the current champion of capital city La Paz. No organised club championship existed then in Colombia (that would eventually be commenced still in 1948, but later that year, in August, whereas the South American Club Championship was held in Feb-Mar 1948). Venezuela would become a party to Conmebol only in 1952, 4 years after the South American Club Championship. No reason is <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> absence of a Paraguayan, though the 1947 Paraguayan Civil War may possibly have been the reason.

The Rus' {{had an interest in}} removing the Khazar hold on the Volga trade route because the Khazars collected duties from the goods transported by the Volga. Byzantine incitement also apparently played a role. Khazars were the allies of the Byzantines until the reign of Romanus I Lecapenus, who persecuted the Jews of his empire. According to the Schechter Letter, the Khazar ruler Joseph responded to the persecution of Jews by [...] "doing away with many Christians" [...] and Romanus retaliated by inciting Oleg of Novgorod (called Helgu in the letter) against Khazaria.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey Meyers {{writes that}} Hemingway was very <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> husband's role, {{because in this}} story he was writing about a {{familiar}} subject—the experiences of his boyhood in Michigan.

The father's suicide serves as a symbolic rejection of the white doctor whose skill is necessary, but who brings with him destruction. In her paper [...] "Screaming Through Silence: The Violence of Race in 'Indian Camp'", Amy Strong writes [...] "Indian Camp" [...] is about domination; the husband kills himself at the moment his wife is cut open by a white doctor. She thinks the theme of domination exists on more than one level: Nick is dominated by his father; the white outsiders dominate in the Indian camp; and the white doctor [...] "has cut into the woman, like the early settlers leaving a gash in the tree." ...|$|E

500|$|On the Turkish side, by {{that night}} the 2nd Battalion 57th Infantry were on Baby 700, the 3rd Battalion, reduced to only ninety men, were at The Nek, and the 1st Battalion on Mortar Ridge. Just south {{of them was the}} 77th Infantry, next was the 27th Infantry {{opposite}} 400 Plateau. The last regiment, the 72nd Infantry, were on Battleship Hill. As for manpower, the Turks were in a similar situation to the ANZACs. Of the two regiments most heavily involved, the 57th had been destroyed, and the 27th were exhausted with heavy casualties. Large numbers of the 77th had deserted, and the regiment was in no condition to fight. The 72nd was largely intact, but they were a poorly trained force of Arab conscripts. The III Corps, having to deal with both landings, could not assist as they had no reserves available. It was not until 27 April that the 33rd and 64th Infantry Regiments arrived to reinforce the Turkish forces. The ANZACs, however, had been unable to achieve their obectives, and therefore dug in. Gallipoli, like the Western Front, turned into a war of attrition. The German commander, Liman von Saunders, was <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reasons for the outcome. He wrote that, [...] "on the Turkish side the situation was saved by the immediate and independent action of the 19th Division." [...] The division commander, Kemal, became noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the campaign. As a commander he was able {{to get the most out}} of his troops, typified by his order to the 57th Infantry Regiment; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders can come and take our place." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under social {{pressure}} from the climbing community Odell varied his opinion on several occasions as to the very spot where {{he had seen the}} two black dots. Most climbers believe he must have seen them climbing the far easier First Step. In the expedition report he wrote that the climbers were on the second-to-last step below the summit pyramid, indicating the famous and more difficult Second Step. [...] Odell's account of the weather situation also varied. At first, he described that he could see the whole ridge and the summit. Later, he said that only a part of the ridge was free of mist. After viewing photographs of the 1933 expedition, Odell again said that he might have seen the two climbers at the Second Step. Shortly before his death in 1987, he admitted that since 1924 he had never been <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> exact location along the northeast ridge where he had seen the black dots.|$|E

2500|$|Julius Caesar {{describes}} Gaul at {{the time}} of his conquests (58–51 BC) as divided into three parts, inhabited by the Aquitani in the southwest, the Gauls of the biggest central part, who in their own language were called Celtae, and the Belgae in the north. Each of these three parts was different in terms of customs, laws, and language. He noted that the Belgae, were [...] "the bravest of the three peoples, being farthest removed from the highly developed civilization of the Roman Province, least often visited by merchants with enervating luxuries for sale, and nearest to the Germans across the Rhine, with whom they are continually at war". Ancient sources such as Caesar are not always <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> things used to define ethnicity today. While Caesar or his sources described the Belgae as distinctly different from the Gauls, Strabo stated that the differences between the Celts (Gauls) and Belgae, in countenance, language, politics, and way of life was a small one, unlike the difference between the Aquitanians and Celts. The fact that the Belgae were living in Gaul means that in one sense they were Gauls. This may be Caesar's meaning when he says [...] "The Belgae have the same method of attacking a fortress as the rest of the Gauls." ...|$|E

The proposition was made {{with a view to}} safeguarding the national self-respect of Dravidians threatened by Indo-Aryan culture, language, political leadership, and business interests. A separatist conference was held in June 1940 at Kanchipuram when Periyar released the map of the proposed Dravida Nadu.

They then decided to convene a movement to resist the Congress. By the 1940s, E.V.Ramasamy supported Muslim League's claim for a separate Pakistan, and expected its support in return. In an interview with the Governor of Madras, Jinnah, the main leader of Muslim League, said that India should be divided into four regions: Dravidistan, Hindustan, Bengalistan and Pakistan; Dravidistan would approximately consist of the area under the Madras Presidency. Jinnah stated [...] "I have every sympathy and shall do all to help, and you establish Dravidistan where the 7 per cent Muslim population will stretch its hands of friendship and live with you on lines of security, justice and fairplay." ...|$|E
