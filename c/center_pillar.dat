25|$|The five-storey pagoda, {{located in}} Sai-in area, stands at 32.45 meters in height (122feet) and is {{approximately}} 20X20 in width {{and is one}} of the oldest wooden buildings in the world. The wood used in the <b>center</b> <b>pillar</b> of the pagoda is estimated through a dendrochronological analysis to have been felled in 594. The central pillar rests three meters below the surface of the massive foundation stone, stretching into the ground. At its base is enshrined what is believed to be a fragment of one of Buddha's bones. Around it, four sculpted scenes from the life of the Buddha face north, east, south and west. Although the pagoda is five-storied, there is no access to the interior; it is rather designed to inspire people with its external view.|$|E
2500|$|Z02 - Spyder {{appearance}} : Black highlights on front, {{side and}} rear of body headlight openings, parking light openings, windshield, rear window and side window moldings, body sill, door and <b>center</b> <b>pillar</b> louvers, {{rear end panel}} - (bright window moldings with black exterior), black or gold rear accents (taillight blackouts and rear end panel decals), body color front air dam and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems (front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel horn button insert), body side stripes with Spyder lettering in red, white or gold depending on body color, black painted styled-steel wheels with trim rings and center caps, black sport mirrors, special hood decal and rear spoiler decal. For the 1980 model year, Chevrolet combined the Spyder equipment and appearance packages into one Spyder equipment package with an RPO code of Z29 and included newly re-designed bold Spyder side decals and a new front air dam that blends into the front fender wheel openings. [...] Spyder decal color choices (five) were based primarily upon the interior color specified rather than the body color as in previous years.|$|E

5000|$|In 1973, the Cutlass Supreme, {{like other}} GM {{mid-size}} cars, was redesigned. Hardtop models {{were replaced by}} new [...] "Colonnade" [...] styling with fixed <b>center</b> <b>pillars.</b> Concerns over proposed rollover standards caused many automakers to phase out their pillarless hardtops and convertibles throughout the 1970s, and the Cutlass was no exception. Despite some initial controversy over the disappearance of hardtop models, the new 1973 GM mid-sized line proved highly successful. Cutlass Supreme coupes had a unique roofline with vertical opera windows not shared with other Cutlass coupes, as well as unique front end styling.|$|R
2500|$|A highly trimmed, two-door coupe, {{the first}} Regal shared its {{front and rear}} styling with its Century parent with distinctions amounting to differing grilles and {{taillight}} lenses. The Regal shared the same [...] "Colonnade" [...] pillared hardtop roofline (a hardtop with B-pillars (<b>center</b> <b>pillars)</b> but frameless doors unlike a sedan body) and greenhouse (window area) with the Grand Prix, Monte Carlo, and Cutlass Supreme {{as well as the}} lower-priced Buick Century Luxus coupe. Like its corporate cousins, the Regal (and Luxus) featured the newly fashionable opera windows, which were small fixed rear-side windows surrounded by sheetmetal, instead of the traditional roll-down windows.|$|R
5000|$|The 1973 Chevelle Laguna [...] "Colonnade" [...] hardtop {{featured}} a semi-fastback roofline with styled [...] "B" [...] pillars, frameless door glass and distinctive rear quarter glass on two-door coupes. New side windows with styled <b>center</b> <b>pillars</b> were featured on four-door sedan models. The new-design B pillars were structurally {{strong enough to}} contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. GM had anticipated federal roll-over safety standards for January 1974 that did not materialize. The unusually thin windshield pillars contributed to the much improved visibility over the previous generation Chevelles. Two Laguna station wagons were introduced, including a Laguna Estate. The wagons, available in six or nine passenger seating, {{featured a}} counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easy entry and loading up to [...]|$|R

5000|$|For 1973, the Marquis {{received}} a minor restyling with a boxier look, giving it new protruding energy-absorbing [...] "5-mph" [...] bumpers {{and a new}} roofline. [...] Two- and four-door hardtops (as well as four-door pillared hardtops that had frameless door glass and slim fixed <b>center</b> <b>pillars)</b> were available as the Marquis or Marquis Brougham. The 1975 models were slightly revised to look longer than the boxier 1973-1974 range. The Grand Marquis was introduced as a luxury trim line in 1975 when the Monterey series was dropped and all full-size Mercurys took the Marquis name. [...] Unlike the related Crown Victoria, which was an option package on the LTD Landau, the Grand Marquis was a trim level in its own right.It was also available prior to 1975 on Marquis Brougham which consisted of leather seats and trim.. Base-trim and upscale Colony Park station wagons were available.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of the B (or <b>center)</b> <b>pillar</b> on four-door sedans, the pillar is {{typically}} a closed steel structure welded at the bottom to the car's rocker panel and floorpan, {{as well as on the}} top to the roof rail or panel. This pillar provides structural support for the vehicle's roof panel and is designed for latching the front door and mounting the hinges for the rear doors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{automotive}} {{usage of}} the term [...] "hardtop" [...] is most often applied for a fixed roof body style without a [...] "b" [...] or <b>center</b> <b>pillar.</b> They were sometimes called a [...] "hardtop convertible" [...] because {{they were designed to}} look like a convertible with the top raised. While some early models retained side window frames and B-pillars, by the 1950s, most were [...] "pillarless hardtops." [...] The designs omitted the B-pillar (the structural roof support behind the front doors) and configuring the window frames, if any, to retract with the glass when lowered.|$|E
50|$|A padded {{roof was}} {{standard}} equipment on all Town Cars, with its design determined by trim level. On standard-trim Town Cars, a leather-grained vinyl full-length covering with <b>center</b> <b>pillar</b> coach lamps was fitted. For Signature Series and Cartier trims, a padded vinyl coach roof (covering the rear {{half of the}} roof) with a frenched (smaller) rear window opening was fitted; the coach roof was also an option on standard-trim Town Cars. On non-Cartier Town Cars, a full-length cloth (canvas) roof was an option; imitating {{the look of a}} convertible, the design deleted the C-pillar quarter windows.|$|E

5000|$|From 1973 to 1977, the Le Mans {{and other}} GM {{intermediates}} were much larger in size than previous models due to evolutionary changes {{that resulted in}} larger cars year after year and federally mandated 5 mph crash bumpers that added weight and length. During this period, Pontiac's intermediate lineup included the base Le Mans, Le Mans Sport Coupe, GTO (1973 only), Luxury Le Mans (became the Grand Le Mans in 1975), the Euro-styled Grand Am from 1973 to 1975, and the 1977 Can Am. Body styles were all based on GM's Colonnade design for both sedans and coupes (no convertibles or hardtops offered after 1972) that included <b>center</b> <b>pillars</b> for improved rollover safety standards but eliminated true hardtop design, along with frameless windows similar to a hardtop. Two-door coupes featured triangular [...] "fixed" [...] rear side windows that did not open, which were covered with louvers on the Le Mans and GTO sport coupes, and the new Grand Am coupe.|$|R

It has a shape of a disc with a straight edge, with a vertical pillar with a dipole acting as the driven element in roughly the middle and a conductive disc at the top acting as a sub-reflector. The bottom disc has the diameter of two wavelengths, and its collar (edge) is quarter the wavelength tall. The <b>center</b> <b>pillar</b> consists of two coaxial tubes (their diameter has to be carefully chosen to give the desired impedance), with a quarter-wavelength slot cut into the outer tube ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the idea grew {{to try to}} revive the center, and Apostel asked Aerts to look into it. As a result, in the {{aftermath}} of a major international and interdisciplinary conference entitled 'Einstein meets Magritte', in 1995, the Center Leo Apostel was re-founded, with Diederik Aerts as its director. Senior researcher Francis Heylighen, and his PhD student Johan Bollen, as well as Aerts's group of PhD students joined the center. Funding was obtained for new postdocs, Jan Broekaert and Alex Riegler, and for a new PhD student, Ernest Mathijs. At the same time, funding was secured for a FWO-research community entitled 'Research on the Construction of Integrating World Views', which still is one of the <b>center's</b> <b>pillars.</b> Also Aerts's acceptance to become Editor-in-Chief of the journal 'Foundations of Science' was part of the broadening of his research interest and focus to cover a more interdisciplinary realm. The Worldviews group continues gathering on a regular basis and its publications contain the fruits of the discussions during these meetings.|$|R

The artists carved fourteen complex miniature figures on the central panel of the right <b>center</b> porch <b>pillar,</b> while working in dim light in a cramped cave space. The medallion reliefs in Cave 24 similarly show loving couples and anthropomorphic arts, rather than flowers of earlier construction. Cave 24's sanctum has a seated Buddha in pralamba-padasana.|$|R

Shorter vertical grille guards appeared {{in about the}} same position as before. Rear fendersides were flatter without the elliptical bulge. The thin beltline molding was positioned lower by several inches. The rear end had vertical bumper ends with the taillight built in. Both bumpers, especially the rear, protruded further from the body. Coupes were no longer hardtops, instead sporting large wide [...] "coach" [...] windows giving a thick <b>center</b> <b>pillar</b> look. A new curved instrument panel housed a digital clock.

40|$|We observe {{condensation}} of exciton polaritons {{in quantum}} states composed of concentric rings when exciting cylindrical pillar GaAs/AlGaAs microcavities non-resonantly by a {{focused laser beam}} normally incident at the <b>center</b> of the <b>pillar.</b> The number of rings depends on the pumping intensity and the pillar size, and may achieve 5 in the pillar of 40 mkm diameter. Breaking the axial symmetry when moving the excitation spot away from the <b>pillar</b> <b>center</b> leads to transformation of the rings {{into a number of}} bright lobes corresponding to quantum states with nonzero angular momenta. The number of lobes, their shape and location are dependent on the spot position. We describe the out-of-equilibrium condensation of polaritons in the states with different principal quantum numbers and angular momenta with a formalism based on Boltzmann-Gross-Pitaevskii equations accounting for repulsion of polaritons from the exciton reservoir formed at the excitation spot and their spatial confinement by the pillar boundary.
