The most common type of funnel is the ProSlide Tornado which is installed at almost 60 locations around the world dating back to 2003.

25|$|Adobe {{acquired}} Aldus Corp. in 1994, {{a software}} vendor that sold FreeHand, a <b>competing</b> <b>product.</b> Freehand was direct competition to Adobe Illustrator, Adobe's flagship vector-graphics editor. The Federal Trade Commission intervened and forced Adobe to sell FreeHand back to Altsys, and also banned Adobe from buying back FreeHand or any similar {{program for the}} next 10 years (1994-2004). Altsys was then bought by Macromedia, which released versions 5 to 11. When Adobe acquired Macromedia in December 2005, it stalled development of Freehand in 2007, effectively rendering it obsolete. With FreeHand and Illustrator, Adobe controlled the only two products that compete in the professional illustration program market for Macintosh operating systems.|$|E

25|$|From his {{responsibility}} for documentation and testing, Raskin had great influence on early engineering projects. Because the Apple II only displayed uppercase characters on a 40-column screen, his department used the Polymorphic Systems 8813 (an Intel-8080-based machine running a proprietary operating system called Exec) to write documentation; this spurred {{the development of}} an 80-column display card and a suitable text editor for the Apple II. His experiences testing Applesoft BASIC inspired him to design a <b>competing</b> <b>product,</b> called Notzo BASIC, which was never implemented. When Steve Wozniak developed the first disk drives for the Apple II, Raskin went back to his contacts at UCSD and encouraged them to port the UCSD P-System operating system (incorporating a version of the Pascal programming language) to it, which Apple later licensed and shipped as Apple Pascal.|$|E

However, Wilson criticized the software license that only permits installation on three PCs, contrasting it with Iolo System Mechanic 10, a <b>competing</b> <b>product</b> that allows an unlimited number of installations in the same household.|$|E
2500|$|... 1994: {{acquired}} Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got {{the communication}} systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr and Professor Gerd Ascheid. COSSAP was a <b>competing</b> <b>product</b> to SPW from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware). Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.|$|E

2500|$|On April 18, 2005, Adobe Systems {{announced}} {{an agreement to}} acquire Macromedia in a stock swap valued at about $3.4 billion. The Department of Justice regulated the transaction that came 10 years after the Federal Trade Commission’s 1994 ruling which barred Adobe from acquiring FreeHand. The acquisition took place on December 3, 2005, and Adobe integrated the companies' operations, networks, and customer-care organizations shortly thereafter. Adobe acquired FreeHand along with the entire Macromedia product line that included Flash, Dreamweaver, and Fireworks but not including Fontographer, which FontLab Ltd. licensed with an option to buy all rights to. Adobe's acquisition of Macromedia {{cast doubt on the}} future of FreeHand, primarily because of Adobe's <b>competing</b> <b>product,</b> Illustrator. Adobe announced in May 2006 that it planned to continue to support FreeHand and develop it [...] "based on [...] customers' needs". One year later on May 15, 2007, Adobe said that it would discontinue development and updates to the program and the company would provide tools and support to ease the transition to Illustrator. In a 2008 interview with Senior Product Manager of Illustrator, Terry Hemphill, he told FreeHand users: “FreeHand {{is not going to be}} revived; time to move on, really. The Illustrator team is making a determined effort to bring the best of FreeHand into Illustrator, which should be evident from some of the new features in CS4.” ...|$|E
