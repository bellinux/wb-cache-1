On the basis of an objective classification of monthly mean sea level pressure (SLP) grids reconstructed back to 1780 and monthly historical station data for the same period, temperature and precipitation changes in Central Europe since 1780 are decomposed into two parts; one part due to frequency changes of large-scale <b>circulation</b> <b>types,</b> and the other part caused by (dynamic and climatic) changes within these <b>circulation</b> <b>types.</b> This is achieved by applying a particular decomposition scheme for moving 31 -year time windows during the 1780 – 1995 period. Results indicate that large parts of the long-term variations in Central European climate cannot be explained sufficiently by frequency changes of <b>circulation</b> <b>types.</b> Roughly one half of these variations—even up to 80 % during July—can be ascribed to varying internal properties of some major <b>circulation</b> <b>types.</b> Percentages of frequency-related and within-type-related climate changes are seen to vary on decadal to multidecadal time scales, thus implying that relationships between large-scale circulation patterns and regional climates are characterised by distinct instationarities. Furthermore, regional climate variations, being attributable to within-type changes of major <b>circulation</b> <b>types,</b> can only partly be explained by corresponding variations in dynamic properties (vorticity, intensity) of these <b>circulation</b> <b>types.</b> This points to {{the importance of}} further sources for within-type variability, including subgrid-scale processes, synoptic-scale variations, and modifications of the climatic boundary conditions.

The field study revealed two dominant circulation types, denoted "anticlockwise" and "clockwise". The anticlockwise <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> was characterized by longshore currents flowing {{from the back of}} the bay to the northern headland where a rip current was located. The clockwise <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> was characterized by longshore currents flowing from the northern headland to the back of the bay where a rip current was situated. Anticlockwise circulation types were primarily found to occur during periods of low waves, the clockwise circulation during periods of high waves. Winds and coastal currents were found not to have a major influence on the circulation within the bay. The theoretical study was based on a model of longshore currents in a semi-circular bay (O'Rourke and Le Blond, 1972). This study showed that a change of the height of the wave could lead to a change in the direction of flow of the longshore current. In agreement with the field study, a low wave height was found to result in an anticlockwise <b>circulation</b> <b>type,</b> a high wave height resulting in a clockwise <b>circulation</b> <b>type.</b> The change from one <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> to the other depended on the relative strength of two opposing mechanisms. One mechanism arose from the obliquity of the wave approach to the shore. This mechanism generated longshore currents towards the back of the bay and was dominant during high waves. The other mechanism resulted from the non-uniformity of the wave height around the bay and generated longshore currents flowing {{from the back of the}} bay. Coastal currents were measured as part of the field study. A fair correlation was-observed between the direction of the coastal current and that of the wind, particularly if the winds were moderate to strong. Temperature and salinity measurements were also made. These properties showed seasonal variations in accord with the principles of upwelling. Surface water was found to have a salinity similar to that found at a depth of 400 to 600 metres in the South Atlantic Ocean.

The atmospheric <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> classification offers a unique opportunity for validating the GCM-based circulations. Six GCMs used in the last IPCC report are analysed here. A correlation-based classification is constructed for each model using daily geopotential height at 500 hPa over Greenland. It is applied to a dataset combining the GCM-based outputs (20 C 3 M scenario) for the current climate and the NCEP-NCAR 1 reanalysis data over the period 1961 - 1990 allowing a direct comparison for each <b>circulation</b> <b>type.</b> Most of the analysed models are able to reproduce the main circulation types, but they fail to reproduce their frequencies because they underestimate the climate variability. In addition, some biases in the mean geopotential height remain. However, we use our atmospheric <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> classification for analysing future projections made by GCMs. As for the 20 th century climate, a combined classification is made integrating reanalysis data over 1971 - 1990, GCM-based outputs over 1971 - 1990 (using 20 C 3 M scenario) and GCM-based outputs over 2046 - 2065 and 2081 - 2100 (using A 1 B scenario). No new circulation types are individualised knowing that the main changes are just a general increase of the geopotential height. Furthermore, the changes in frequency observed between the 20 th century climate and the first future period (2046 - 2065) are of the same order than the uncertainties of the models for simulating the current climate by comparison with the reanalysis data.

Finally, an impact index was calculated to estimate the incidence of the African dust outbreaks produced during each circulation pattern, in the areas of study. Four circulation types were obtained (I-IV) and three main potential source areas of African dust were identified (Western Sahara and Morocco; Algeria; northeastern Algeria and Tunisia). The circulation pattern I (24 % {{of the total number of}} episodic days) produced the transport of dust mainly in summer from Western Sahara, southern Morocco and Tunisia.

40|$|Future {{projections}} of the Greenland ice sheet melt are based on General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations. In particular, the reliability of downscaling methods forced by these simulations depends {{on the quality of}} the atmospheric circulation simulated by GCMs. Therefore, it is essential to analyse and evaluate the GCMs modelled general circulation for current climate (1961 - 1990). Atmospheric <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> classifications offer a very interesting approach for evaluating the GCM-based circulation at a daily time scale compared to the most used methods based only on monthly means. Indeed, the <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> classification allows a precise and detailed analysis of each <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> and so, it gives much more information on the ability of GCMs to simulate the different circulation types and consequently the climatic variability of a region. In fact, exceptional circulation events over Greenland, which cannot be taken into account by the monthly mean approach, have much more impact on the melt than the mean atmospheric state. Thus, an automated correlation-based atmospheric <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> classification (CTC) is used for evaluating the new GCM outputs (available on [URL] computed for the upcoming IPCC report (AR 5). The daily geopotential height at 500 hPa simulations of the GCMs for current climate are compared to the NCEP-NCAR 1 and the ECMWF reanalysis data for the summer months (JJA), when melt is the most important. To achieve this, the classification is first done for the reanalysis data over 1961 - 1990 and afterwards, the types of the reanalysis based CTC are imposed for classifying the GCM datasets over 1961 - 1990 (from the historical experiment) to allow a direct type per type comparison based on the frequency distribution of each dataset. This approach also gives the opportunity to study the intraclass repartition differences between the reanalysis and the GCMs. After the evaluation of the GCM simulations for current climate, the future projections driven by RCP concentrations or emissions (2011 - 2040, 2041 - 2070 and 2071 - 2100) from the best matching GCMs are analysed in the same way. For current climate, it clearly appears that only a few GCMs are able to reproduce reliably the variability of the atmospheric circulation over Greenland during summer. The differences of frequency between the GCMs and the reanalysis are mainly due to biases of the geopotential height which is systematically over or underestimated by most GCMs and to the underestimation of the variability of the circulation by most GCMs. For future projections, no new circulation types are detected, but rather a general increase of the mean geopotential height regardless of the <b>circulation</b> <b>type.</b> It is also important to note that for many GCMs, the uncertainty of the current climate simulations (given by the differences of the classification results between the GCM simulations for current climate and the reanalysis data for the same time) are of the same order than the projected changes for future climate. Therefore, these projections may be questionable. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Some {{studies show}} that most General Circulation Models (GCMs) have {{difficulties}} to simulate the main observed circulation patterns and their frequencies. However, this does not only impact the GCM based projections for future climate, but also the results of downscaling methods using the circulation simulated by GCMs as forcing. Indeed, the downscaling methods {{are not able to}} correct the biases introduced by the GCM simulations in the free atmosphere. Here, we focus on the anticyclonic blocking situations over western Europe for summer (June, July and August). Indeed, these blocking situations, which are often related to droughts and heat waves, could become more frequent due to global warming. Moreover, their frequency and persistence depend on the variability of the circulation, which is known to be difficult to reproduce by the GCMs. In order to evaluate the ability of the GCMs to reproduce the observed frequency and persistence of blocking situations, we compare them with two reanalysis datasets (NCEP-NCAR 1 and ECMWF ERA- 40) by using an automatic <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> classification. The daily geopotential height at 500 hPa over the last 30 years of the current climate simulation (Historical experiment, 1976 - 2005) of all available CMIP 5 GCMs prepared for the upcoming IPCC report AR 5 is used here. The <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> classification groups similar daily circulation situations together on basis of a leader-algorithm to obtain a few homogeneous circulation types describing the general circulation of the region. Thus, the frequency and the persistence of each <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> can be analysed on a daily timescale. We show that the ability of the GCMs to reproduce the observed frequency and persistence of blocking situations is influenced by the anomalies in their <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> frequency repartition. So, the GCMs which underestimate the frequency of the anticyclonic types tend to simulate less and shorter blocking situations. The contrary is observed for GCMs that overestimate the frequency of these circulation types. This rises questions about the reliability of the future projections for events related to blocking situations. Indeed, when applying the same approach as for the current climate to the future projections (experiments RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5), it seems that the blocking situations become more frequent and persistent. However, when considering only the circulation patterns by removing the mean geopotential height increase due to global warming, there is no significant circulation change till 2100. This means that the GCMs conserve their circulation biases in spite of climate change and so, the frequency and the persistence of the blocking situations are projected to remain almost the same as those simulated for the current climate.

The study is focused on the area of Poland and covers the 1981 – 2010 period, for which the WRF model has been run using three nested domains with spatial resolution of 45 km × 45 km, 15 km × 15 km and 5 km × 5 km. For the model evaluation, we have used the data from the innermost domain, and data from the second domain were used for circulation typology. According to the <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> analysis, the anticyclonic types (AAD and AAW) are the most frequent. The WRF model is able to reproduce the daily air temperatures and the error statistics are better, compared with the interpolation-based gridded dataset. The high-resolution WRF model shows a higher spatial variability of both air temperature and rainfall, compared with the E-OBS dataset. For the rainfall, the WRF model, in general, overestimates the measured values.

40|$|The classifications of {{atmospheric}} circulation patterns are a specific research area within synoptic climatology. In general, {{there are three}} main groups of classifications: subjective, mixed and objective. In methodological aspect, the recent tendencies are presented in full objectification of classification procedure by mathematical-statistical methods. The classifications {{of atmospheric}} circulation are very useful tools in climate change research; for reconstruction of the past climate, analysis of variability of the present climate and in the estimates of future climate. The practical application is to produce weather forecasts in meteorology and for more specific purpose e. g. analysis of air quality, wind atlas, the studies of human health. There are many scientific and operational applications of classifications <b>circulation</b> <b>types,</b> {{but there is a}} lack of researches who deal with this issue in scientific literature in Serbia. Only in recent years, there are a few papers that explore the correlation between the climate variability in Serbia and the features of <b>circulation</b> <b>types.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A b s t r a c t The {{parameters}} of the birch pollen seasons in Cracow in 1991 - 2008 were analysed in relation to some meteorological elements and synoptic situations (<b>circulation</b> <b>types,</b> air masses and atmospheric fronts). Two types of the pollen seasons were distinguished – highly dense and less dense. The first type of the season started on the 15 th of April (on average), lasted 11 - 20 days and the maximum daily concentration exceeded 500 pgm- 3. The less dense type started generally earlier (the first decade of April), lasted more than 20 days and the peak days were unsta-ble. In this type of the pollen season, two peak days were often observed. The relationship between the type {{of the season and}} the meteorological conditions before the season was pointed out. Additionally, the influence of <b>circulation</b> <b>types,</b> types of air masses and atmospheric fronts over south-eastern Poland on a given day on the number of days with a daily concentration> 80 pgm- 3 was analysed. The relationship between the pollen sea-son type and meteorological conditions before the season was found, among others, the influence of types of synoptic situa-tions and air masses on the number of days with a concentration of over 80 pgm- 3 was established...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} between the occurrence of thunderstorms with heavy pre-cipitation (> 30 mm) and atmospheric <b>circulation</b> <b>types.</b> The study covers the period 1951 – 1998 and is based on a matching span of records of thunderstorm occurrence and daily precipitation totals at 47 weather stations in Poland. A catalogue of <b>circulation</b> <b>types</b> by Osuchowska-Klein, data on frequency of fronts over south-eastern Poland by Niedźwiedź and weather maps were used. In Poland, days with a thunderstorm and more than 30 mm of precipitation are extremely rare and occur mainly in summer. Their recurrence period amounts to about two to four years, with the exception of mountain areas (southern Poland) where they occur nearly every year. The heaviest precipitation on a day with thunderstorm, 166. 1 mm, was recorded at a high-mountain station on Mt. Kasprowy Wierch. Apart from this station the highest precipitation was 141. 0 mm and only eight stations had at least one record of more than 100 mm. Four regions characterised by different <b>circulation</b> <b>types</b> most favourable for the occurrence of thunderstorms with heavy precipitation were identified. In all of them southerly advection was most favourable for the occurrence of the phenomena studied (Sc, SEc, Sa/c), but that effect was especially prominent in the south-western region. Most of the days with thunderstorm and heavy precipitation coincided with the passing of an atmospheric front over Poland (53. 8 – 81. 9 % days depending on the station). Days with air-mass thunderstorm and heavy precipitation were rare and mostly occurred in areas of variable topography...|$|R

40|$|The Greenland {{ice sheet}} is {{projected}} to be strongly affected by global warming. These projections are either issued from downscaling methods (such as Regional Climate Models) or they come directly from General Circulation Models (GCMs). In this context, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the accuracy of the daily atmospheric circulation simulated by the GCMs, since it is used as forcing for downscaling methods. Thus, we use an automatic <b>circulation</b> <b>type</b> classification based on two indices (Euclidean distance and Spearman rank correlation using the daily 500 hPa geopotential height) to evaluate the ability of the GCMs from both CMIP 3 and CMIP 5 databases to simulate the main circulation types over Greenland during summer. For each <b>circulation</b> <b>type,</b> the GCMs are compared to three reanalysis datasets {{on the basis of their}} frequency and persistence differences. For the current climate (1961 – 1990), we show that most of the GCMs do not reproduce the expected frequency and the persistence of the circulation types and that they simulate poorly the observed daily variability of the general circulation. Only a few GCMs can be used as reliable forcings for downscaling methods over Greenland. Finally, when applying the same approach to the future projections of the GCMs, no significant change in the atmospheric circulation over Greenland is detected, besides a generalised increase of the geopotential height due to a uniform warming of the atmosphere.

40|$|Changes in {{atmospheric}} circulation over Europe since 1958 were examined using both objective (modes of low-frequency variability and objective classification of <b>circulation</b> <b>types)</b> and subjective (Hess-Brezowsky classi-fication of weather types) methods. The {{analysis was performed}} {{with an emphasis on}} the differences between the winter (DJF) and summer (JJA) seasons, and between objectively and subjectively based results. Majority of the most important changes in {{atmospheric circulation}} are same or similar for the objective and subjective methods: they include the strengthening of the zonal flow in winter since the 1960 s to the early 1990 s; the increase (decrease) in frequency of anticyclonic (cyclonic) types in winter from the late 1960 s to the early 1990 s, with a subsequent decline (rise); and the sharp increase in the persistence (measured by the mean residence time) of all groups of <b>circulation</b> <b>types</b> in winter around 1990 and of anticyclonic types in summer during the 1990 s. Differences between the findings obtained using the objective and subjective methods may result from the intrinsically different approach to the classification (e. g. the Hess-Brezowsky weather types have a typical duration of at least 3 days while objective types typically last 1 – 3 days). Generally, changes in atmospheric circulation which have taken place since the 1960 s were more pronounced in winter than in summer. The most conspicuous change seems to be the considerable increase in the persistence of <b>circulation</b> <b>types</b> during the 1990 s, which may be also reflected in the increase in the occurrence of climatic extremes observed in Europe during recent years. 1...|$|R

40|$|Sosnowiec {{is located}} in the Katowice Region, which is the most {{urbanized}} and industrialized region in Poland. Urban areas of such character favor enhancement of pollution concentration in the atmosphere and the consequent emergence of smog. Local meteorological and circulation conditions significantly influence not only on the air pollution level but also change air temperature considerably in their centers and immediate vicinities. The synoptic situation also plays the major role in dispersal and concentration of air pollutants and changes in temperature profile. One of the most important are the near-ground (100 m) inversions of temperature revealed their highest values on clear winter days and sometimes stay still for the whole day and night. Air temperature inversions in Sosnowiec occur mainly during anticyclone stagnation (Ca-anticyclone centre and Ka-anticyclonic ridge) and in anticyclones with air advection from the south and southwest (Sa and SWa) which cause significantly increase of air pollution values. The detailed evaluation of the influence of <b>circulation</b> <b>types</b> on the appearance of a particular concentration of pollutants carried out in this work has confirmed the predominant influence of individual <b>circulation</b> <b>types</b> on the development of air pollution levels at the Katowice region.
