2500|$|The Sixteenth Edition (October 1905) was {{edited by}} J. C. DaCosta, and the Seventeenth (September 1908) by DaCosta and E. A. Spitzka. Spitzka edited the Eighteenth (Oct. 1910) and Nineteenth (July 1913) editions, and in October 1913, R. Howden edited the New American from the Eighteenth English Edition. [...] The [...] "American" [...] editions then {{continued}} with <b>consecutive</b> <b>numbering</b> from the Twentieth onwards, with W. H.

50|$|The first {{system used}} by Victorian Railways of {{identifying}} the locomotives was <b>consecutive</b> <b>numbering</b> from 1 onwards for both passenger and goods locomotives; so the goods engines were numbered 1-4 and the passenger engine No.1. This was soon changed to <b>consecutive</b> <b>numbering</b> from 1-5 allotted with the goods locos adding 1 to their numbers. This numbering was later superseded by {{the introduction of}} the system of allotting odd numbers starting from 1 for goods locomotives, and even numbers starting from 2 for passenger locos. This system remained in use until 1912. It was expedient to begin the odds and evens series with the J Class with the goods locos numbered 11-17 (Odds only) and passenger loco numbered 12.|$|E
50|$|It was {{the third}} <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> one single from Spirits Having Flown, which {{followed}} three <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> one singles from their previous album Saturday Night Fever.

40|$|Four rats responded under {{a simple}} fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> {{schedule}} in which eight or more consecutive {{responses on the}} run lever, followed by a single response on the reinforcement lever, produced the food reinforcer. Under this simple schedule, dose-response curves were determined for diazepam, morphine, pentobarbital, and phencyclidine. The rats were then trained to respond under a multiple fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> schedule in which a discriminative stimulus signaled when the response requirement on the run lever had been completed {{in one of the}} two fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> component schedules. Under control conditions, the percentage of reinforced runs under the multiple-schedule component with the discriminative stimulus added was much higher than the percentage of reinforced runs under the multiple-schedule component without the discriminative stimulus. All of the drugs decreased the percentage of reinforced runs under each of the fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> schedules by increasing the conditional probability of short run lengths. This effect was most consistently produced by morphine. The drugs produced few differences in responding between the multiple fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> components. Responding under the simple fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> schedule, however, was affected at lower doses of the drugs than was responding under the same fixed <b>consecutive</b> <b>number</b> schedule when it was a component of the multiple schedule. This result {{may be due to the}} difference in schedule context or, perhaps, to the order of the experiments...|$|R
50|$|The {{product of}} any four <b>consecutive</b> <b>numbers</b> is {{divisible}} by 24. This is because among any four <b>consecutive</b> <b>numbers</b> {{there must be}} two even numbers, {{one of which is}} a multiple of four, and there must be a multiple of three.|$|R

This is unlike the Interstates in Georgia, which have used reference post numbering since 2000. This means that exit numbers on SR 400 start at 1 and use consecutive numbers (2, 3, 4, etc.) regardless of the nearest mile marker.|$|E

50|$|Bates {{numbering}} (also {{known as}} Bates stamping, Bates branding, Bates coding or Bates labeling) {{is used in}} the legal, medical, and business fields to place identifying numbers and/or date/time-marks on images and documents as they are scanned or processed, for example, during the discovery stage of preparations for trial or identifying business receipts. Bates stamping can be used to mark and identify images with copyrights by putting a company name, logo and/or legal copyright on them. This process provides identification, protection, and automatic <b>consecutive</b> <b>numbering</b> of the images.|$|E

50|$|These {{lightweight}} trailers {{were the}} purchased {{for the opening}} to Groudle Glen in 1893 but only No. 49 remains in semi-regular service today. Of note also, is number 51 which was restored to original condition in 1989 including detailing of original fleet name on the end dash panels and lightweight roof. At this time the car was numbered 13 as it would originally have been; in 1893 when it arrived there were no power cars numbered past 3, and so the trailers took <b>consecutive</b> <b>numbering</b> sequence but owing to a subsequent re-think by the operators, trailers were re-numbered commencing after the last power car (33). So {{it was that the}} original number 13 was displayed until it reverted to its latter number 51 during management and policy changes in 2001. This trailer is also serviceable but the remaining class members are in storage, with 52 serving as a flatbed wagon. Traditionally this car was stripped of its seating and roofing each winter for use by permanent way crews, but this practice ceased in 1954 after which time the item has been a dedicating flatbed runner. It survives today and had a distinctive yellow-painted dash panel with standard painted fleet number, based at Laxey Car Sheds.|$|E
