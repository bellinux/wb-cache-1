50|$|The largest sizes {{would be}} carried in {{holsters}} across a horse's back {{just ahead of}} the saddle. In-between sizes included the <b>coat</b> pocket <b>pistol,</b> or <b>coat</b> <b>pistol,</b> which would fit into a large pocket, the coach pistol, meant to be carried on or under the seat of a coach in a bag or box, and belt pistols, sometimes equipped with a hook designed to slip over a belt or waistband. Larger pistols were called horse pistols. Arguably the most elegant of the pistol designs was the Queen Anne pistol, which was made in all sizes.|$|R
50|$|The pocket pistol {{originated}} in the mid-17th century as a small, concealable flintlock known as the Queen Anne <b>pistol,</b> the <b>coat</b> <b>pistol,</b> or the pocket pistol. This was used throughout the 18th century, evolving from a weapon reserved for the wealthy to a common sidearm in broader use {{as more and more}} manufacturers made them by the start of the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Queen Anne pistols are {{a type of}} flintlock pistol {{distinguished}} by the lockplate being forged in one piece with the breech and the trigger plate. They are usually a breech-loading design known as a turn-off pistol. Possibly first made in England, they came in fashion in England {{during the reign of}} Anne, Queen of Great Britain, hence the name. Though made in all sizes up to carbine, they were usually made in the size range known as <b>coat</b> pocket <b>pistols</b> or <b>coat</b> <b>pistols,</b> easy to conceal on one's person. A small version, known as a Toby or muff pistol, was able to be concealed in a smaller pocket or a ladies' hand warmer muff.|$|R
50|$|Treat and {{the party}} bought the {{property}} on the Passaic River from the Hackensack Indians by exchanging gunpowder, one hundred bars of lead, twenty axes, twenty <b>coats,</b> guns, <b>pistols,</b> swords, kettles, blankets, knives, beer, and ten pairs of breeches.|$|R
60|$|It was. But the brawling creek he had swam a {{few hours}} before had risen, more than doubled its volume, and now rolled a swift and resistless river between him and Rattlesnake Hill. For the first time that night Richard's heart sank within him. The river, the mountain, the {{quickening}} east, swam before his eyes. He shut them to recover his self-control. In that brief interval, by some fantastic mental process, the little room at Simpson's Bar and the figures of the sleeping father and son rose upon him. He opened his eyes wildly, cast off his <b>coat,</b> <b>pistol,</b> boots, and saddle, bound his precious pack tightly to his shoulders, grasped the bare flanks of Jovita with his bared knees, and with a shout dashed into the yellow water. A cry rose from the opposite bank as the head of a man and horse struggled for a few moments against the battling current, and then were swept away amidst uprooted trees and whirling drift-wood.|$|R
50|$|During the melee, Heney {{broke away}} from Handy and removed from his <b>coat</b> pocket a <b>pistol</b> he carried for protection. Handy tried to take the weapon from Heney, and during the struggle, the gun discharged. A bullet lodged in the doctor’s abdomen, and hours later, while {{well-known}} Dr. George Goodfellow operated, Handy died. Immediately following the shooting, Heney surrendered to authorities. Bail was set at $6,000, which three friends promptly paid. On September 26, a hearing was held. Cameron among others testified that Handy had repeatedly threatened to kill Heney. Witnesses testified that {{on more than one}} occasion, as the lawyer walked along the street, Handy had intentionally attempted to run Heney over with his buggy. The court determined that Heney had acted in self-defense and he was exonerated.|$|R
5000|$|Three weeks later, having skillfully inveighled General Fairside into {{inviting}} him {{for dinner at}} the Hambone, Calder slips [...] "into the special pocket of his <b>coat</b> an automatic <b>pistol.</b> It had—like its owner—a short, stout body," [...] the only characteristic of Calder mentioned in the story. During the course of [...] "an excellent dinner" [...] Calder and Barlow, [...] "the doyen of Hambone staff", agree on the excellence of the Corton from Burgundy that both men have had with their dinners. After dinner, Fairside and Calder settle themselves into the [...] "large leather armchairs which make the coffee room of the Hambone {{one of the best}} sitting-out places in London, where they are eventually joined by the two other men who have attracted Calder's interest, Sir George Gould and Sir Frederick Lake.|$|R
500|$|Outside {{the court}} house where Ike was being fined, Wyatt almost walked into 28 year-old Tom McLaury {{as the two}} men were brought up short nose-to-nose. Tom, who had arrived in town the day before, was {{required}} by the well-known city ordinance to deposit his pistol when he first arrived in town. When Wyatt demanded, [...] "Are you heeled or not?", McLaury said he was not armed. Wyatt testified that he saw a revolver in plain sight on the right hip of Tom's pants. As an unpaid deputy marshal for Virgil, Wyatt habitually carried a pistol in his waistband, as was the custom of that time. Witnesses reported that Wyatt drew his revolver from his <b>coat</b> pocket and <b>pistol</b> whipped Tom McLaury with it twice, leaving him prostrate and bleeding on the street. Saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan testified at the Spicer hearing afterward that he saw McLaury deposit a revolver at the Capital Saloon sometime between 1–2:00 pm, after the confrontation with Wyatt, which Mehan also witnessed.|$|R
5000|$|He also {{robbed the}} Brownstone & Swartz store at Grangeville in 1878. He put his knife to the stomach {{of the store}} manager, Henry Jerusalem, and {{reportedly}} said, [...] "You, do not know me—no? I am Procopio—the Red-Handed Dick. You will open the safe for me, amigo." [...] Procopio tied up Jerusalem and another worker, Emil Seligman, leaving them to lie on the store's floor overnight with their small dog for company. [...] Loaded with clothing and supplies, Procopio fled on horseback for Arroyo Poso de Chane, several {{miles east of the}} present Coalinga. [...] Procopio's horse drowned as he attempted to cross a slough near Summit Lake. Traveling by foot, he encountered the posse sent to capture him at the sheep camp of Frank Woods and Theodore Draper. According to a first-person account by posse member Joel Whiteside, posse members encountered Procopio carrying a saddle on a trail, and Procopio asked in Spanish if they knew the way to Libertad, a nearby Mexican settlement. One of the posse members attempted to question him, but Procopio reportedly fled into the fog. [...] The next day, the posse received a tip that Procopio was staying at a cabin owned by the Higuera brothers. According to Whiteside, they found Procopio asleep in the cabin and took him into custody. [...] Procopio asked permission to dress himself and, when he put on his <b>coat,</b> drew two <b>pistols</b> from his breast pocket and opened fire. [...] In the ensuing firefight, posse member Sol Gladden, who was to have been married the following week, was shot twice (once in the mouth) and killed as he entered the cabin. [...] According to one press report: [...] "Procopio made good his escape after the possemen had emptied their weapons vainly trying to shoot him in the smoke-filled cabin." ...|$|R
