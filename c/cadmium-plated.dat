50|$|Sheet {{assembly}} of light aircraft is accomplished predominantly with rivets of alloys 2017-T4, 2117-T4, or 2024-T4. Self-tapping sheet metal screws {{are available in}} aluminum alloys, but <b>cadmium-plated</b> steel screws are employed more commonly to obtain higher shear strength and driveability. Alloy 2024-T4 with an anodic coating is standard for aluminum screws, bolts, and nuts made to military specifications. Alloy 6262-T9, however, is superior for nuts, because of its virtual immunity to stress-corrosion cracking.|$|E

50|$|Zinc {{coatings}} prevent oxidation of {{the protected}} metal by forming a barrier and by {{acting as a}} sacrificial anode if this barrier is damaged. Zinc oxide is a fine white dust that (in contrast to iron oxide) does not cause {{a breakdown of the}} substrate's surface integrity as it is formed. Indeed, the zinc oxide, if undisturbed, can act as a barrier to further oxidation, in a way similar to the protection afforded to aluminum and stainless steels by their oxide layers. The majority of hardware parts are zinc-plated, rather than <b>cadmium-plated.</b>|$|E
50|$|On most aircraft, use of {{titanium}} {{was limited}} by the costs involved; it was generally used only in components exposed to the highest temperatures, such as exhaust fairings and the leading edges of wings. On the SR-71, titanium was used for 85% of the structure, {{with much of the}} rest polymer composite materials. To control costs, Lockheed used a more easily worked titanium alloy which softened at a lower temperature. The challenges posed led Lockheed to develop new fabrication methods, which have since been used in the manufacture of other aircraft. Lockheed found that washing welded titanium requires distilled water, as the chlorine present in tap water is corrosive; <b>cadmium-plated</b> tools could not be used as they also caused corrosion. Metallurgical contamination was another problem; at one point 80% of the delivered titanium for manufacture was rejected on these grounds.|$|E

40|$|A Fe-I 3 Co-llNi- 3 Cr-lMo- 0. 2 C steel alloy, {{processed}} for ultra-high {{strength and}} fracture toughness, exhibits three distinct hydrogen trap {{states in a}} complex precipitation hardened martensitic microstructure and is susceptible to severe hydrogen embrittlement (HE) at threshold stress intensity levels as low as 20 MPa'lm. The causes of HE susceptibility include very high crack-tip tensile stresses and a reservoir of diffusible hydrogen that is trapped reversibly with a binding energy, Eb, of 11. 5 _+ 0. 5 kJ/mol at (Fe,Cr,Mo) 2 C precipitates. This reversibly trapped hydrogen repartitions to interstitial sites proximate to the highly stressed crack tip and, subsequently, may retrap at martensitic lath interfaces to produce substantial local hydrogen concentrations and transgranular embrittlement. These results are pertinent to the control of HE in this modem ultra-high strength steel with a <b>cadmium-plated</b> coating and co-deposited hydrogen (H). Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy demonstrates that 190 °C baking removes the detrimental hydrogen associated with (Fe,CrMo) 2 C traps in both precharged but unplated steel {{as well as in}} thin porous, <b>cadmium-plated</b> steel. Restoration of a high fracture toughness and a ductile fracture mode correlates directly with the removal of hydrogen from (Fe,CrMo) 2 C traps as well as other low energy trap states. However, the internal H concentration at such traps is at first intensified upon baking of <b>cadmium-plated</b> steel. Later H egress is retarded by the slow H diffusivity in steel and the barrier action of th...|$|E

40|$|De-icing {{chemicals}} are {{spread on the}} runways to prevent the formation of ice and snow. Formerly used urea, which causes environmental concerns, {{has been replaced by}} mainly potassium formate and potassium acetate based de-icing chemicals. Also betaine based products, developed in Finland, are used as de-icers. The introduction of these new alkali metal based de-icers was followed by an increase in the occurrence of corrosion in different parts of aircrafts, such as <b>cadmium-plated</b> steel parts. The aim of this thesis was to study the corrosive effect of several new de-icing chemicals on cadmium coat-ings and to compare results obtained using various test methods. 	This thesis consists of theoretical and experimental parts. In the literature review, the corrosion mechanisms of cadmium are presented, the de-icing chemicals as a corrosive environment are evaluated, and different corrosion tests for examining the in-fluence of de-icing chemicals on cadmium coatings are described. In the experimental part, the results from different corrosion tests are compared and the corrosive effect of de-icers is researched. Also the effect of de-icing chemical concentration and the cad-mium coating quality on corrosion are examined. The chemicals used in the tests were commercial potassium formate and acetate, pure potassium formate and acetate as well as betaine based commercial de-icing chemical. In this thesis, four different test pro-grams were used, from which two are immersion tests and two cyclic exposure tests, in which the specimens are in turns immersed in the de-icing chemical and in turns in en-vironmental exposure in a heating chamber. The specimens contained four different types of cadmium coatings deposited in three different coating plants. The corrosive ef-fect of each de-icer on cadmium coatings were evaluated after the corrosion tests by weight change measurements and scanning electron microscope. 	According to the results, potassium formates were more corrosive than potassium acetates based on the higher measured weight losses. Betaine based Betafrost B did not cause significant weight changes, thus being the least corrosive of the studied chemicals. In the one month long cyclic exposure test, Boeing 2004, corrosion inhibitors included in commercial potassium formate and commercial potassium acetate decreased the corrosion rate of cadmium, whereas according to the two weeks long cyclic exposure test, AMS G- 12 (2009), the corrosion inhibitors did not decrease the corrosion rate. Undiluted chemicals caused significantly more corrosion on the cadmium coatings than chemicals diluted to 50 % and 25 % by their weight. According to the one month long cyclic exposure test, dull finished specimens lost less weight than bright finished, but otherwise the quality of the cadmium coatings did not influence substantially the results. 	Immersion tests did not produce very reliable results because of the large devia-tions caused by the small weight changes. One day long standardized immersion test ASTM F 1111 was insufficient for evaluating the corrosive effect of de-icers on cad-mium coatings, and {{there is a need to}} develop a new better standard test procedure. Test results were very sensitive to the variation of test parameters, for example temperature and humidity, and therefore the test parameters should be defined precisely when devel-oping a new test method. /Kir 1...|$|E
