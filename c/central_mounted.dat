50|$|Stuart {{originally}} {{named the}} peak <b>Central</b> <b>Mount</b> Sturt, after his former expedition leader Charles Sturt.

50|$|The biplane {{was based}} on the Curtiss Carrier Pigeon, a {{purpose-built}} aircraft for airmail operations. The Lark also had a longer-span lower wing, similar to the Carrier Pigeon.

50|$|While {{making an}} {{important}} statement for CNG technology, the Charger R/T was equally {{appealing to the}} design community. It had functional side scoops, as does the Dodge Viper, and the chrome plated, <b>central</b> <b>mounted</b> exhaust was somewhat reminiscent of the Viper. It even has functional air exhausters sculpted into its rear fascia.|$|E
50|$|Air intakes were sited {{on either}} side of the cockpit in the leading edges of the wings. Due to the {{increasing}} shortages of fuel by the latter stages of the war, it was proposed to use coal (or paraffin-coated lignite dust) as a fuel. A <b>central</b> <b>mounted</b> round or hexagonal shaped combustion chamber constructed from ceramic materials was to be mounted in the wing's interior, designed to be refuellable from above. The aircraft was accelerated to ramjet speeds by rockets attached to the wings and speeds of 1200+km/h were attainable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Central</b> <b>Mount</b> Stuart is a {{mountain}} peak {{situated in the}} southern Northern Territory, Australia.

50|$|Carlsen was homeschooled by his parents. His {{mother taught}} him {{academic}} subjects {{and his father}} instructed him in art. Consequently, his paintings bear a marked resemblance to his father's work. He began exhibiting with the prestigious National Academy of Design in 1915 and he won the Julius Hallgarten Prize twice, in 1919 and 1923. He became an Associate of the National Academy in 1922 and a full member of the National Academy of Design in 1942. Dines Carlsen divided his time between his family's New York home and studio and their home in Falls Village, Connecticut until his father's death in 1933. Thereafter, he lived in Falls River and wintered in Summerville, South Carolina. Carlsen taught students privately in his home. He exhibited his work with the artist's cooperative Grand Central Art Galleries and had solo exhibitions in 1946, 1950 and 1954. Following his death in 1966, Grand <b>Central</b> <b>mounted</b> a dual exhibition of his and his father's work.|$|E
50|$|The Avigo model {{launched}} in 2004 {{is the most}} radical revision of the venerated Ambassador, {{a part of a}} brand revitalisation kicked off in the middle of 2003. The change of name, a break from the Ambassador marque, indicated a different marketing strategy. The Avigo was {{launched in}} the summer of 2004. The revitalized lineup consisted of the Ambassador Classic of mid-2003, the Ambassador Grand of late-2003, and the aforementioned Avigo, with the exterior designed by Manvindra Singh. However, the most overpowering influence on the front bonnet has been that of the original Landmaster series (also based on Morris Oxford). The main panels at the rear remained the same but the tail lamp and name plate bezels were redesigned. In interior the Avigo, however, has much more classic-touch internals. The entire dashboard console was redesigned with a classic retro theme reminiscent of the early models with <b>central</b> <b>mounted</b> meter new clusters (like the Mark IV models). Seats were specially built for this model with dual tonne beige coloured scheme and wood-grain interiors. A factory fitted 6CD Kenwood audio system and new air-conditioning system was installed. The car was priced higher than the existing models.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{contains}} some experimental and numerical simulation test results on cylindrical blunt body drag reduction using thin spikes or shell mounted {{in front of}} a body against a supersonic flow. Experimental tests were conducted using the Aeromechanics and Gas Dynamics Laboratory facilities at the Institute of Mechanics of Moscow State University (IMMSU). Numerical simulations utilizing NASA and IM/MSU codes were conducted at the Hampton University Fluid Mechanics and Acoustics Laboratory. The main purpose of this research is to examine the efficiency of application of multiple spikes for drag reduction and flow stability at the front of a blunt body in different flight conditions, i. e. Mach number, angle of attack, etc. The principal conclusions of these test results are: multiple spike/needle application leads to decrease of drag reduction benefits by comparison with the case of one <b>central</b> <b>mounted</b> needle at the front of a blunt body, but increase lift benefits...|$|E

The building was modeled with the intent {{to meet the needs of}} urban design Partisans Square and intention to build low facility in the north of the complex in order to make the connection with a green background in the surrounding hills. In the basement there is a depot for the needs of the library, on the ground floor of the library reading room, while the upstairs offices are organized around a <b>central</b> <b>mounted</b> corridor.
