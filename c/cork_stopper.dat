40|$|A {{possible}} butyltin contamination {{source in}} wine was studied in this paper. Agglomerated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers,</b> which were produced in Portugal, Spain, and Italy, used in wine bottles were examined. The domestic cork products, cork granules, and mucus used for cork products were also analyzed. The levels of mono- and dibutyltin compounds in corks {{were found in}} the range from < 0. 0024 to 3. 3 and from < 0. 0029 to 6. 7 mug of Sn/g, respectively. A low level of tributyltin contamination was also found in 2 of 31 tested samples. The presence of butyltin compounds in agglomerated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> was confirmed by GC-MS. Experimental results indicated that all overseas agglomerated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> studied contained mono- and/or dibutyltins. Butyltins were not detected in cork granules, mucus, most of the natural <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers,</b> and domestic agglomerated cork products. The concentrations of mono- and dibutyltins increased with the time in a 30 -day experiment, showing that butyltin compounds can leach from agglomerated cork to the wine. When the butyltin concentrations in wine samples were compared with their levels in the corresponding agglomerated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers,</b> a correlation was found. The potential harm of such food contamination was evaluated by the toxic research of butyltin compounds using Daphnia sp. as the experimental model...|$|R

40|$|Polyurethane based {{polymers}} {{are used}} as adhesives in agglomerated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers.</b> These <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> improve wine quality when comparing to screw caps or foam. Agglomerated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> are currently used for still wines, semi-sparkle and gaseous wines, beer and cider. Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) is presently the isocyanate used {{in the production of}} polyurethane based adhesive due to its lowest toxicity comparing with toluene diisocyanate (TDI) previously employed. However, free monomeric MDI (fm-MDI) can migrate from agglomerated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> to beverages. Therefore it needs to be under control. The presence of these compounds are usually investigated by HPLC with Fluorescence or UV-Vis detector depending on the derivatising agent. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detector (UPLC-DAD) method is replacing HPLC with the advantage of decreasing time and solvent consumption. Although optimization is necessary because column and solvent conditions are not the same in both systems. Agglomerated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> glued with MDI based polyurethane were produced and put in contact with food simulant, ethanol:water 50 : 50, with different times after production. Samples were taken, from each contact time after production, after 15, 60, 120, 360 min, 1 day and 1 month contact period. The same proceeding was also performed using dichloromethane as extraction solvent with agglomerated <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> with two days after production. The samples in contact with food simulant (EtOH:H 2 O) was dried with rotary evaporator, dissolved in the appropriated solvent and fm-MDI determined with the analytical method that was optimized. Secondly key parameters of the migration process are expected to be calculated according to a mathematical model based on the second Fick’s equation. Regarding that MDI reacts rapidly very low concentrations of fm-MDI are expected...|$|R

40|$|With the {{availability}} of new techniques to close wine bottles avoiding the risk of ?corky? taste the tradition of closing wine bottles with <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> is on the retreat. As a consequence the Mediterranea cork oak forests with their rich biodiversity are endangered since their cultivation is not profitable anymore. This paper explores the viability of a market approach {{to the preservation of}} these ecologically valuable landscapes. In an internet-based Contingent Valuation survey we assess wine consumers' willingness to pay a higher price for wine bottles closed with high-quality <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> instead of buying wine with alternative stoppers in order to preserve the cork oak landscapes. We find that though many wine consumers have experience with tainted wine they are, nevertheless, willing to buy wine with (highquality) <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> at higher prices. Their average WTP is, however, not sufficient to cover the additional costs of these stoppers. Thus, we propose a financing mix of market returns and government subsidies for preserving the cork oaks. As a precondition for this market approach to be successful bottles with high-quality <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> must be clearly identifiable in the shops, and consumers must be informed about the ecological consequences of supporting the cork production...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the potential of visible and near infrared spectroscopy (VIS+NIRS) combined with multivariate analysis for identifying the geographical origin of cork. The study was carried out on cork planks and natural <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> from the most representative cork-producing areas in the world. Two training sets of international and national cork planks were studied. The first set comprised a total of 479 samples from Morocco, Portugal, and Spain, while the second set comprised a total of 179 samples from the Spanish regions of Andalusia, Catalonia, and Extremadura. A training set of 90 <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> from Andalusia and Catalonia was also studied. Original spectroscopic data were obtained for the transverse sections of the cork planks and for the body and top of the <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> by means of a 6500 Foss-NIRSystems SY II spectrophotometer using a fiber optic probe. Remote reflectance was employed in the wavelength range of 400 to 2500 nm. After analyzing the spectroscopic data, discriminant models were obtained by means of partial least square (PLS) with 70 % of the samples. The best models were then validated using 30 % of the remaining samples. At least 98 % of the international cork plank samples and 95 % of the national samples were correctly classified in the calibration and validation stage. The best model for the <b>cork</b> <b>stoppers</b> was obtained for the top of the stoppers, with at least 90 % of the samples being correctly classified.

50|$|By 1816 Porter {{was living}} in New Haven, Connecticut, where he had a dancing school and began {{painting}} portraits. In 1818-1819 he made a trading voyage to the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii, and in 1819 Porter had returned to painting. He traveled by coach and on foot, painting portraits throughout New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia. He became a prolific muralist between 1825 and 1845, decorating some 160 houses and inns in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and {{as far south as}} Virginia. From simple silhouettes to scenes of entire towns or harbors, Porter spread his art throughout New England. His murals were generally executed in a large scale on dry plaster walls by a combination of freehand painting and stenciling. Some murals were in full color, others in monochrome, with the foliage sometimes stamped in with a <b>cork</b> <b>stopper</b> instead of being painted with a brush. Often he would do portraits of the principal household members where he was doing the murals.|$|E
