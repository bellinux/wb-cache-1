The ultimate aim is to replace petroleum based products or high energy demanding process and this has pushed the researchers to investigate the potential of natural fibers like flax as reinforcement material for composites. However, the uses of cellulosic composites are limited in applications requiring fire resistance due to their flammability and their low thermal resistance. This present research investigated environmentally friendly approaches for improving fire resistance of <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fiber</b> composites, by coating cellulose fibers with layered structure nanoparticles which are low cost and non-toxic or using layered structure based nanocomposites as a matrix.

30|$|The latest {{development}} in nonwoven barrier fabrics is the siliconized thermally bonded highloft barrier material. The siliconized highloft is {{a blend of}} three different types of siliconized fibers (e.g., Basofil®, Tencel® and Protex®) held together with a low-melt polyester ([Hendermann & Bridges 2006]). Each component of the blend provides a specific and necessary functionality to the barrier material. The siliconized melamine fibers provide a non-shrinking form of carbon, whereas the regenerated <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fiber</b> improves the softness and water repellency of the blend. The regenerated <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fiber</b> is very cost effective and can be used to increase the bulk of the product. Siliconized modacrylic fiber, when used in an appropriate blend ratio, can reduce the local oxygen content within the barrier during a fire, thereby prolonging char oxidation. The low melt polyester provides resiliency to the barrier, and its strong thermoplastic character helps to maintain the structural integrity of the char formed.|$|E

It was found that with smaller organic cations, the ion-exchange behavior followed the Donnan model, but larger molecules did not; likely due to Van der Waals forces.

The parameters that were varied during the twin-screw extrusion process were screw configuration, revolutions per minute (rpm), extrusion temperature, and flow rate. The effect of the feeding zone location of <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fiber</b> was also considered. This study investigates the effect of the formulation, <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fiber</b> content, the presence of a coupling agent, and of a reactive additive on composite performance. The composites were characterized in terms of morphology and microstructure, fiber length, rheological, thermal, and mechanical properties. Sensibility to humidity and recyclability were also considered. When compared with as-received PP, the tensile strength of injection-molded parts increased with cellulosic content by up to 40 vol %, and the tensile modulus increased 3. 5 times when a combination of coupling and reactive agents was used. Exposed to controlled humidity of 50 % during 1 year, these composites exhibited a very low level of humidity uptake around 0. 85 wt %. The processability of these materials using a cast film line and the mechanical properties of extruded sheets are also presented.
