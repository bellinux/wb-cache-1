40|$|There is {{relatively}} little Canadian military history which looks specifically at {{the questions and}} themes surrounding senior command (commanders of large formations of troops—normally generals or lieutenant–generals). Current interpretations call for a trilogy of abilities: the ability to defend national interests in the highest military (and often political) circles; the ability to organize and manage forces both before and during combat; {{and the ability to}} lead both directly and indirectly those who have to implement the plans. Were Canadians then, and are historians today, right to apply this multiple standard? This article looks at the three officers who commanded First Canadian Army during the Second World War: Generals A. G. L. McNaughton, H. D. G. Crerar and G. G. Simonds. Where these <b>comanders</b> might well possess one or two of these abilities they could as easily have little competence in the third. Overall Crerar comes out the best of the three...|$|R

50|$|In 1523 Johannes Dorfmann or <b>Comander</b> was {{appointed}} parish priest of St. Martin's Church and began preaching the new {{faith of the}} Protestant Reformation. It spread rapidly and by 1524-25 the bishop had fled the city and Protestant services were {{taking place in the}} churches of St. Martin and St. Regula. The Ilanz articles of 1524 and 1526 allowed each resident of the Three Leagues to choose their religion, and sharply reduced the political and secular power of the Bishop of Chur and all monasteries in League territory. By 1527 all of Chur, except the bishop's estates, had adopted the Reformation. On 1 January 1529 Abbot Theodore Schlegel was publicly beheaded. Bishop Thomas Planta, a friend of St. Charles Borromeo, tried, but without success, to suppress Protestantism. He died, probably poisoned, 5 May 1565.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} method of {{bidirectional}} interaction between a human and a humanoid robot in terms of emotional expressions. The robot is able to detect continuous transitions of human emotions that ranges from very sad to very happy using Active Appearance Models (AAMs) and Neural Evolution Algorithm to determinate the face shape and gestures. As a response of the human emotions, the robot performs postural reactions that dynamically adapt to the human expressions, performing a body language which changes in terms of intensity as the human emotions vary. Our method is implemented in the HOAP- 3 humanoid robot.

40|$|A diversidade de {{cultivar}}es de morangueiro exige estudos quanto à adaptação {{no local}} de cultivo. Por sua vez, a maior exigência do consumidor por produtos mais saudáveis requer informações a respeito das características nutracêuticas dos produtos. Este trabalho objetivou determinar as cultivares com maior adaptação ao cultivo protegido na região do Planalto Médio do Rio Grande do Sul, os teores de antocianinas, bem como a época de plantio que proporcionam maior produtividade. O experimento foi conduzido em um ambiente protegido de 280 m², coberto com filme de polietileno de baixa densidade (PEBD), de 150 µm, com aditivo anti UV. O delineamento foi em blocos ao acaso, com três repetições, e os tratamentos em parcelas subdivididas, sendo as épocas de plantio das mudas (28 de abril e 13 de maio) as parcelas principais, e as cultivares (Dover, Tudla, <b>Comander,</b> Oso Grande, Campinas, Chandler, Serrano e Camarosa), as subparcelas. Foram avaliadas características fenológicas e componentes do rendimento. Os teores de antocianinas foram determinados por espectrofotometria, com comprimento de onda de 528 nm. Não houve interação entre cultivares e épocas de plantio sobre as características avaliadas. A maior produtividade foi do morangueiro cultivado precocemente, em abril. As cultivares Camarosa, Dover, Oso Grande e Tudla são as mais indicadas, pelo maior rendimento e escalonamento da produção, e a cultivar Serrano, pelo maior teor de antocianinas. The diversification of strawberry cultivars demands studies about their adaptation in the cultivation place and, {{the increase of}} the consumer's requirement for healthier products require studies about the products nutraceutica characteristics. In such a way, this work aimed to determine the cultivars with higher adaptation under protected environment in Rio Grande do Sul, Planalto Médio region, the contents of anthocyanins, {{as well as the}} period that provides more productivity. The experiment was conduced in an inside structure of 280 m²covered with PEBD film, with 150 µm and anti UV additive. The designs were arranged in split plots with 3 repetitions, the treatments in subdivided portions, and the period for planting seedlings (April 28 th and May 13 th) the main plots, and the cultivars (Dover, Tudla, <b>Comander,</b> Oso Grande, Campinas, Chandler, Serrano e Camarosa), the sub-plots. Phenological characteristics and yield components were evaluated. The content of anthocyanins was determinated by using a specterphotometer with wave length of 528 nm. There was no interaction between cultivars and planting periods about the evaluated characteristics. The higher productivity was the earlier planting strawberry crop in April. The cultivars Camarosa, Dover, Oso Grande and Tudla are the most recommended for their greater productivities and range of production periods, and "Serrano" cultivar for higher antocianin levels...|$|E

Darling, will you also include in your letters the date when you received my letters? I presume {{you are doing}} this. It seems that my getting on the “Red Ball Express” and then reverting back to the outfit confused you and I can’t see as I blame you. No doubt the air mail will be beating the V-mail since you used the “Red Ball” address on the V-mail {{and it will take}} time to catch up. Today was a beautiful day as far as weather was concerned. I might add it was a good day even for our military activity. The temperature was in the 70 s and I went outside merely in a jacket. I can laugh when I think of you back in Shaker Hts., Ohio with that wonderful weather, and I hope, bubsie, you don’t have car trouble again. I’ve still to receive your cablegram. You know my address is “Ammody. ” Do you want me to send you cablegrams? This morning I went on a little trip to get some information for my Division Artillery <b>Comander.</b> I hob-knobbed with Col’s of different outfit[s] and even spoke with an English Brigadier (Brig-Gen.). By Joe, he was a pleasant chap with a good-sized pot belly. Sweetheart, I’m very muched [sic] surprised at the division in general. It’s a darn good outfit in spite of itself. You know that our infantry consists primarily of A. S. T. P. college boys which remind[s] me I’ve got to run down Nate Morris and see how he’s getting along. I know that my finances account was all “screwed up” but I’ve gotten it straighten[ed] out finally. The allotment[s] have been straightened out once and for all. You see, I hadn’t been paid for close to 2 months which added to the general confusion. I hope now things will run more smoothly[;] however, if by the next payment things don’t straighten out with you, let me know, darling. ETO stands for European Theatre of Operations, O. K. ? Sweetheart, I’m making a request for film No. 127 for my camera. Get me as much as you can. (My new camera hasn’t shown up yet.). I’ve given up all ideas of promotion and honestly I don’t care one way or another. My main concern is getting this over with and coming back to you to raise little ones. I know you agree. P. S. I took another swell shower. War is hell (?). Knocking myself out. Mucha Love, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E
