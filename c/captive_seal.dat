40|$|Compound-specific isotope (CSI) {{analysis}} is rapidly growing {{tool in the}} field of ecology to assess the trophic position and foraging behavior of an animal. Only a handful of studies have examined the values and patterns of carbon and nitrogen amino acid isotopes (δ 13 C-AA and δ 15 N-AA), and have primarily been done on plankton and other low trophic position organisms. Since AA data separate into unique biochemical groupings, much more detailed information is revealed than the widely used bulk isotope technique - such as source of diet (offshore vs. coastal), base of the food web, trophic positions, and an animals physiology. To examine the usefulness and power of the CSI method, we tested how  δ 13 C-AA and  δ 15 N-AA patterns and values appear in several populations of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) off the California coast, primarily comparing seals from San Francisco Bay (SFB) and the Channel Islands (CI). In Chapter 1, we compared bulk isotopes in <b>captive</b> <b>seals</b> from The Marine Mammal Center to wild seal populations. Our results indicated similar trophic transfer δ 15 N values between predator and prey compared to other organisms. It concluded that weaner seals (< 1 year) from SFB and CI had recently weaned from their mother's milk, and were transitioning to a diet offish and invertebrates. Chapter 2 was the very first CSI study δ 15 N-AA on marine mammals, where we examined the 'trophic' and 'source' AA grouping differences in <b>captive</b> <b>seals.</b> A smaller trophic enrichment factor (TEF) was shown compared to past studies on plankton. We hypothesize this is attributed to an animal's main form of nitrogen excretion (ammonia vs. urea), where urea-excreting animals exhibit this lower TEF value. Thus, we propose using a new multi-TEF trophic position equation to estimate the foraging ecology of wild harbor seals (Chapter 3). This equation provides more accurate predictions, suggesting they consume prey around 2. 5 to 3 trophic positions. The coupled δ 13 C-AA and δ 15 N-AA data suggest SFB yearlings (1 – 2 years) are nutritionally stressed, as they show higher than expected trophic position estimations. While seals in CI are consuming different types of prey (offshore vs. nearshore), but at expected trophic positions...|$|R

There {{was no significant difference}} in seasonal changes in reproductive hormone levels between six <b>captive</b> individuals and <b>seals</b> caught from the wild (n = 80). Based on results from both the captive and the wild individuals, the plasma progesterone concentration was elevated in late gestation, whereas it declined at the equivalent time in nonpregnant females. The progesterone concentration was also elevated during the phase of delayed implantation, but there was no difference between pregnant and nonpregnant <b>seals.</b> In <b>captive</b> <b>seals</b> given exogenous GnRH, the LH concentration peaked 10 - 20 min after injection of GnRH, and the magnitude of the LH response depended upon the dose up to ~ 120 ng·kg- 1.

Seasonal changes in pituitary sensitivity were apparent in both adults and juveniles. There was evidence that three of the four juvenile seals attained puberty during the study.

Preliminary results indicate that within PWS, harbor seals fall at the top of food chains based on locally derived productivity. Isotope ratios along whiskers grown over the past year indicate, however, that some individuals migrate into areas (presumably in the Gulf of Alaska) wherein the food web structure has different carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios.

Dyadic nosing rates increased in the breeding season, while solo rates declined. Distinct individual differences were evident for most types of nosing, and seasonal patterns among males emerged for some types; for example, nose-to-nose and nose-to-body acts were more frequent during the breeding season, while nose-to-object acts were less frequent during this season.

These DTH responses correlated well with in vitro tests of T-lymphocyte function, implicating this cell type in the reaction. Aryl-hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor-dependent toxic equivalent (TEQ) profiles in blubber biopsies taken from the seals implicated polychlorinated biphenyls rather than dioxins or furans in the observed immunosuppression.

These findings, together with the results of the Great Lakes piscivorous bird studies and one in which <b>captive</b> common <b>seals</b> were fed "environmentally contaminated " fish, suggest that the "environmental " PHAH mixtures accumulated in fish represent a significant threat t...|$|R
50|$|Leopard seals {{are very}} vocal {{underwater}} during the austral summer.The male seals produce loud calls (153 to 177 dB re 1 μPa at 1 m) for many hours each day. While singing the seal hangs {{upside down and}} rocks {{from side to side}} under the water. Their back is bent, the neck and cranial thoracic region (the chest) is inflated and as they call their chest pulses. Adult male leopard seals have only a few stylized calls, some are like bird or cricket-like trills yet others are low haunting moans. The leopard seals have age-related differences in their calling patterns, just like birds. Where the younger male seals have many different types of variable calls - the adult male seals have only a few, highly stylized calls. Each male seal produces individually distinctive songs. They arrange their few call types into individually distinctive sequences (or songs). The acoustic behavior of the leopard seal is believed to be linked to their breeding behaviour. In male seals, vocalizing coincides with the timing of their breeding season, which falls between November and the first week of January; <b>captive</b> female <b>seals</b> vocalize when they have elevated reproductive hormones.|$|R
40|$|Growth {{rates of}} vibrissae (whiskers), which {{act as a}} {{temporal}} record of feeding in harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), were estimated using 13 C- and 15 N-labeled glycine followed by stable-isotope analysis. The labeled glycine was incorporated into keratin {{and served as a}} temporal marker for growth-rate calculation. One <b>captive</b> harbor <b>seal</b> received two doses 147 days apart, while a second seal received one dose; vibrissae were analyzed after 86 and 154 days. The peak positions indicated that growth began in the fall, continued into spring, but ceased in June, with active growth rates of 0. 33 mm/day. Two adult captive Steller sea lions each received two labeled doses during a 308 -day period. After 427 days vibrissae in both sea lions showed two peaks corresponding to the markers; growth rates were calculated as 0. 05 – 0. 07 mm/day. Growth rates in captive juvenile and wild adult Steller sea lions, 0. 10 – 0. 17 mm/day, supported the assumption that major isotopic oscillations in vibrissae of wild sea lions were annual. The multiyear records imply that Steller sea lions retain their vibrissae; harbor seal vibrissae, in contrast, have periods of rapid growth and appear to be shed, at least in part, annually...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the role of the}} marine mammals as components in foodwebs, {{it is important to know}} the composition frequency and size of their meals. Marine mammals have a core body temperature of about 37 °C, and feed mainly on poikilothennic animals. Food intake will therefor lead to a coating of the stomach, followed by an increased metabolism. Up till now there has been no direct method for measuring the amount of food ingested by free ranging animals. Here we describe the use of a method for remote registration of changes in stomach temperature to quantify meal sizes in <b>captive</b> harbour <b>seals</b> (Phoca vitulina). This might serve as a calibration of technology that may also be applied to free ranging seals. The animals were fed a range of meal sizes at various temperatures and individual fish sizes. The time taken to regain initial stomach temperature from minimum temperature (recovery time) was significantly related to both meal size and meal temperature. The time taken from initial temperature to initial temperature again was regained (total time) was also significantly related to both meal size and meal temperature. Recovery time is in this experiment considered the best available indicator of meal size when meal temperature is known...|$|R
