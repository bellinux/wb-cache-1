40|$|This article {{examines}} the incentives for Cournot oligopolists to share information about a <b>common</b> <b>parameter</b> or about firm-specific parameters. We assume that the private information that firms receive has equal accuracy and obeys a linear conditional expectation property. We find that when the uncertainty is about a firm-specific parameter, perfect revelation is the unique equilibrium. When the uncertainty is about a <b>common</b> <b>parameter,</b> no information sharing is the unique equilibrium. But the nonpooling equilibrium converges to the situation where the pooling strategies are adopted as {{the total amount of}} information increases. Hence, the efficiency is achieved in the competitive equilibrium as the number of firms becomes large. ...|$|R

40|$|Often, {{tasks are}} {{collected}} for multi-task learning (MTL) because they share similar feature structures. Based on this observation, in this paper, we present novel algorithm-dependent generalization bounds for MTL by exploiting {{the notion of}} algorithmic stability. We focus {{on the performance of}} one particular task and the average performance over multiple tasks by analyzing the generalization 1 ability of a <b>common</b> <b>parameter</b> that is shared in MTL. When focusing on one particular task, {{with the help of a}} mild assumption on the feature structures, we interpret the function of the other tasks as a regularizer that produces a specific inductive bias. The algorithm for learning the <b>common</b> <b>parameter,</b> as well as the predictor, is thereby uniformly stable with respect to the domain of the particular task and has a generalization bound with a fast convergence rate of order O(1 =n), where n is the sample size of the particular task. When focusing on the average performance over multiple tasks, we prove that a similar inductive bias exists under certain conditions on the feature structures. Thus, the corresponding algorithm for learning the <b>common</b> <b>parameter</b> is also uniformly stable with respect to the domains of the multiple tasks, and its generalization bound is of the order O(1 =T), where T is the number of tasks. These theoretical analyses naturally show that the similarity of feature structures in MTL will lead to specific regularizations for predicting, which enables the learning algorithms to generalize fast and correctly from a few examples...|$|R

50|$|Most {{commonly}} {{contour lines}} are drawn in plan view, {{or as an}} observer in space would view the Earth's surface: ordinary map form.

In actuality, both plan and profile view contour maps are used in air pollution and noise pollution studies.|$|E
