40|$|M. B. A. A {{share buyback}} scheme is a {{situation}} where a company buys back its shares from shareholders and then cancels them or creates treasury shares. The Companies Act, 1973 (Act 61 of 1973), previously limited the {{reduction in the number of}} shares to preference shares which could only be redeemed by a transfer of the equal amount to the <b>capital</b> <b>redemption</b> reserve fund, a non-distributable reserve in order to maintain the capital levels. Section 85 of the Companies Act now allows a company to buy back its ordinary shares and cancel them without replacing them with a <b>capital</b> <b>redemption</b> reserve fund. The only requirement is that the company must prove that they will be liquid and solvent after undertaking such a share buyback. This has far-reaching consequences for the creditors who rely on the capital maintenance rule as the only protection afforded to them should the company go bankrupt. The reduction in the number of shares after the share buyback also creates problems. Firstly, the company's operating capabilities can be reduced, damaging the remaining and future shareholders and secondly, the company's earnings per share (EPS) can improve without any improvement in the actual performance. This tends to make the Annual Financial Statements (AFS) unreliable as the users still rely on the EPS for an indication of whether the company is growing or not. Companies use a share buyback for various other reasons, the most important of which being that they want to distribute excess cash back to shareholders. Some of these companies, however, go back to the lending houses to borrow money to finance their current operations immediately after the share buyback. It is imperative to investigate the real reason why companies undertake a share buyback and what effect this has on the profitability and the earnings per share of listed companies in South Africa...|$|R

5000|$|A key goal of {{the capital}} {{structure}} changes was to stop {{large amounts of money}} washing in and out of Fonterra’s balance sheet each year as milk production fluctuates. Under the previous structure, farmers matched their shareholding with their milk production by owning one co-operative share for each kilogram of milksolids (kgMS) produced annually. [...] If their milk production dropped in any season, they could redeem shares back to the co-operative, which was required to buy the shares back off them. Consequently, Fonterra faced the risk of losing large amounts of share <b>capital</b> through <b>redemptions</b> during times of declining milk production. [...] For instance, after milk production fell during the 2007/08 drought, Fonterra had to pay out $742 million of share capital to farmers via redemptions.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Providing {{basic access}} to water and {{sanitation}} is critical for poverty alleviation and stimulating economic growth, {{but at the same}} time it is putting a huge strain on South Africa’s existing economic infrastructure. Local governments allow their existing wastewater infrastructure to deteriorate to the extent that it no longer functions according to its design, and then apply for capital funding for refurbishment. Capital investment alone will not provide a sustainable solution to meet the increased demand on the ageing wastewater infrastructure, since local governments do not have the financial means and technical capacity to adequately maintain and operate their infrastructure. A paradigm shift is required to develop alternative and innovative business models to ensure a sustainable solution providing continued and consistent capacity as a basis for further expansion. Public-private partnerships (PPP) could provide a feasible solution towards building a sustainable technical capacity at local governments. Engaging the private sector must however not be aimed towards access to private sector finance, but rather the improvement in operational efficiency and increased level in service. Obtaining private sector finances will be the wrong focus for engaging in PPP undertakings in South Africa. Private operation must be combined with public financing. The design-build-operate (DBO) model with public financing would be highly viable. Such an arrangement will hold no financial risk to the private sector entity with revenue collection strictly remaining a local government function. The DBO method of delivery (with public funding) will be an effective way to realize cost savings, achieve efficiencies in construction and operation, utilize expertise, and most importantly, for skills transfers and capacity building at local government level. Ultimate sustainability will only be achieved once local government is able to raise the majority of its own funds for operation and maintenance through tariffs and other instruments, including some towards <b>capital</b> <b>redemption.</b> Grant funding must make provision for maintenance and operation of all capital funded projects. All shareholders must join forces in lobbying this concept at the highest political echelons because in terms of Section 154 of the Bill of Rights, national and provincial governments have a duty towards local governments to support and strengthen their capacity, to effectively perform their functions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Some investors {{may not be}} able to use {{leverage}} at all or {{they face}} different margin requirements. Investing in securities with high-embedded leverage enables those investors to obtain desired level of market exposure without violating their margin constraints. Investors in hedge funds can gain access to this high-embedded leverage by investing in hedge fund share classes that have leverage multipliers higher than one. Hedge funds characteristically exploit different arbitrage and speculative investment strategies. These strategies typically entail illiquid assets, and to obtain the flexibility hedge funds often restrict investors’ ability for <b>capital</b> <b>redemptions.</b> This is done by applying different share restrictions. Illiquid investments can also yield to serially correlated returns. This study employs extensive hedge fund database, which is constructed by merging five individual databases. The use of this database contributes to previous academic studies, since such thorough database has not been employed in studies concerning hedge funds. Furthermore, this study contributes to the recent academic studies by investigating the return differences between unleveraged and leveraged hedge fund share classes. Additionally, this study considers, whether the return spread is larger for hedge funds that invest in illiquid assets. Finally, this study investigates whether some predefined macroeconomic and risk factors are able to explain those returns differences. This study finds two specific implications that contribute to the previous academic literature. First, there exists a return difference between unleveraged and leveraged share classes, and that difference is statistically and economically significant. Second, return difference can be partly explained by some macroeconomic and risk variables. Aggregate hedge fund flow has a positive relationship with the return difference and it acts as a key variable in explaining those return differences. Additionally, this study finds that overall movements in financial markets affect the returns of leveraged hedge fund share classes. Increases in different risk variables cause leveraged share classes to reduce their exposures and their leverage is not constantly at the promised level. This makes them to resemble more their unleveraged pairs and induces return difference to decrease. As a conclusion, returns of leveraged share classes, scaled with their respective leverage, are lower than the returns of unleveraged share classes. This finding brings important implications for hedge fund investors. Ability of some macro and risk variables to explain the return difference helps investors to understand the factors affecting the return spread and help them to time leveraged hedge fund investments properly...|$|R
50|$|The levelling-off of {{the growth}} of the debt in the years before 1740, and again after 1750, caused a curious dilemma for the Dutch rentiers: they kept accumulating <b>capital</b> from bond <b>redemptions</b> and {{retained}} bond earnings, due to an undiminished high average propensity to save (though their wealth allowed them to wallow in luxury at the same time). However, there were few attractive investment opportunities for this new capital in the domestic Dutch economy: as explained in the article on the economic history of the Netherlands, structural problems militated against expansion of the private sector, and the public debt hardly expanded (even decreased after 1750). This development gave undeniable discomfort to Dutch investors. It presented them with two unenviable alternatives: hoarding (which apparently happened on an appreciable scale, leading to a large increase in the amount of money in circulation, while the velocity of circulation dropped), or investing abroad.|$|R
50|$|Sir George Lowthian Trevelyan 4th Baronet (5 November 1906 - 9 February 1996) was a British {{educational}} pioneer and {{a founding}} {{father of the}} New Age movement. After listening to a lecture by Dr Walter Stein, a student of Rudolf Steiner in 1942, he turned from being agnostic to new age spiritual thinker, and even studied anthroposophy in the coming years. He first became a History teacher at Gordonstoun School, pioneering radical education methods. After World War II, he became the Warden at Attingham Park, a pioneering adult education college in Shropshire in 1948, from where he retired in 1971, to found the Wrekin Trust, an educational charity. He was subsequently associated with the Soil Association, the Findhorn Foundation, the Teilhard de Chardin Society and the Essene Network. In the last 15 {{years of his life}} he was the focus of many lecture tours and meetings. He also wrote numerous books, including A Vision of the Aquarian Age (1977), <b>Operation</b> <b>Redemption</b> (1981), Summons to a High Crusade (1985) and finally Exploration into God (1991). He was awarded the Right Livelihood Award, in 1982.|$|R
30|$|The {{period from}} 1881 to 1905 can be {{characterized}} as a period of strictly limited banking freedom: a system with now legally prescribed currency denomination for banknotes and a heavily regulated and harmonized note issue business, but still without a centralized government monopoly in note issue. Banks were severely constrained with regard to their liquidity reserves, their equity <b>capital,</b> their banknote <b>redemption,</b> and their issuing policies. The regulatory standardization and mutual acceptance of notes issued by different banks improved the efficiency of the money and payments system. These conditions, however, undermined competition as it introduced an externality creating incentive to an over-issue of banknotes leading to a tendency towards monetary and currency weakness 4 —a state of affairs which would ultimately lead to full nationalization of banknote issue and the foundation of the Swiss National Bank. In 1891, a revision of the constitution was accepted by the voters which introduced the exclusive right of the confederation to issue banknotes. Conflicts about the legal form of the central bank and the location of its headquarter implied that the Federal Act on the Swiss National Bank came into effect only 14  years later in October 1905. The SNB started its operation in June 1907.|$|R
