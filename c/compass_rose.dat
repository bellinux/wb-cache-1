5|$|To {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a <b>compass</b> <b>rose.</b> His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a sling suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the sling, and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E

25|$|Like {{traditional}} western maps, the Fairylogue and Radio-Play map {{showed the}} west on the left, {{and the east}} on the right. However, the first map of Oz to appear in an Oz book had those directions reversed, and the <b>compass</b> <b>rose</b> adjusted accordingly. It is believed {{that this is a}} result of Baum copying the map from {{the wrong side of the}} glass slide, effectively getting a mirror image of his intended map. When he realized he was copying the slide backward, he reversed the <b>compass</b> <b>rose</b> to make the directions correct. However, an editor at Reilly and Lee reversed the <b>compass</b> <b>rose,</b> thinking he was fixing an error, and resulting in further confusion. Most notably, this confused Ruth Plumly Thompson, who frequently reversed directions in her own Oz books as a result.|$|E

She completed the work by July 30, 1926, when she wrote to enquire where she should send the designs for endorsement by the Commission of Fine Arts. [...] This body since 1921 had been tasked with advising the Secretary of the Treasury on coinage design. [...] She sent photographs of her models to the commission's offices. [...] On August 5, 1926, commission chairman Charles Moore responded enthusiastically, informing her that not only had the commission endorsed the designs, but they were having the prints framed for their meeting room. [...] To save time, the hubs from which coinage dies could be prepared {{were made by the}} Medallic Art Company of New York, which had made reductions from plaster models to hubs for several commemorative issues. [...] The resulting hubs were sent to the Philadelphia Mint, where working dies for the issue were made.

500|$|As {{described}} in the Book of the Later Han, {{the frame of the}} seismometer was a domed bronze vessel {{in the shape of a}} wine jar, although it was [...] in diameter and decorated with scenes of mountains and animals. The trigger mechanism was an inverted pendulum (which the Book of the Later Han calls the [...] "central column") that, if disturbed by the ground tremors of earthquakes located near or far away, would swing and strike one of eight mobile arms (representing the eight directions), each with a crank and catch mechanism. The crank and a right angle lever would raise one of eight metal dragon heads located on the exterior, dislodging a metal ball from its mouth that dropped into the mouth of one of eight metal toads below arranged like the points on a <b>compass</b> <b>rose,</b> thus indicating the direction of the earthquake. The Book of the Later Han states that when the ball fell into any one of eight toad mouths, it produced a loud noise which gained the attention of those observing the device. While Wang Zhenduo (王振铎) accepted the idea that Zhang's seismometer had cranks and levers which were disturbed by the inverted pendulum, his contemporary Akitsune Imamura (1870–1948) argued that the inverted pendulum could have had a pin at the top which, upon moving by force of the ground vibrations, would enter one of eight slots and expel the ball by pushing a slider. Since the Book of the Later Han states that the other seven dragon heads would not subsequently release the balls lodged up into their jaws after the first one had dropped, Imamura asserted that the pin of the pendulum would have been locked into the slot it had entered and thus immobilized the instrument until it was reset.|$|E
