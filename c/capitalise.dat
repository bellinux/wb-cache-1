5|$|A pilot episode for a Battletoads TV {{series was}} also {{produced}} by Canadian DIC Entertainment, {{in an attempt}} to <b>capitalise</b> on the popularity of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The pilot originally aired in syndication in the United States on the weekend of Thanksgiving 1992, but it was never picked up as a full series.|$|E
5|$|A {{grandson}} of the philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, Felix Mendelssohn {{was born into}} a prominent Jewish family. He was brought up without religion until the age of seven, when he was baptised as a Reformed Christian. Mendelssohn was recognised early as a musical prodigy, but his parents were cautious and did not seek to <b>capitalise</b> on his talent.|$|E
5|$|Going into {{production}} in summer 1984 – with studio recordings in September and October – the first series of As Seen On TV {{was intended for}} broadcast late that year. As a theatre tie-in, Wood arranged a short stand-up tour with the same name as the show, to <b>capitalise</b> on her television appearances around the same time. This backfired when the BBC put back the opening broadcast to early the following year.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} bizarre {{software}} products for the ZX81 came about {{as a result of}} music companies attempting to <b>capitalise</b> on the popularity of Sinclair's computers. In 1983, EMI released a single by Chris Sievey that had a ZX81 program recorded on the B-side. Island Records responded with XL1 by Buzzcocks frontman Pete Shelley, packaged with a program for the ZX Spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Ingres sought to <b>capitalise</b> {{on the success}} of his Bertin portrait. He showed his ambitious history painting The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian at the 1834 Salon, but it was harshly criticised; even Ingres' admirers offered only faint praise. Offended and frustrated, Ingres declared he would disown the Salon, abandon his residence in Paris for Rome, and relinquish all current positions, ending his role in public life. This petulance was not to last.|$|E
5|$|To <b>capitalise</b> on the {{benefits}} of cloud computing, Eagle Boys shifted its ordering system to Microsoft Azure in 2015. Through providing improved website performance and uptime and providing more sophisticated performance metrics, the new hosting system should support more online orders, which the Eagle Boys IT chief says are worth 1.5 times the orders which are made in-store or by telephone.|$|E
2500|$|Except in all caps, {{the letter}} {{immediately}} following a word-initial apostrophe is not <b>capitalised.</b> If necessary, the second word is <b>capitalised</b> instead: [...] "'s Avonds is zij nooit thuis." [...] (She is never {{at home in}} the evening.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that when}} the letter is the initial of a <b>capitalised</b> word (like Džungla or Džemper, or {{personal}} names like Džemal or Džamonja), the ž is not uppercase. Only when the whole word is written in uppercase, is the Ž <b>capitalised.</b>|$|R

5|$|A tag team {{match for}} the Unified Tag Team Championship followed, between the champions The Hart Dynasty (Tyson Kidd and David Hart Smith), who were {{accompanied}} by their manager Natalya, and the team of Chris Jericho and The Miz. The Hart Dynasty took the early advantage, but Jericho and The Miz were able to isolate both Smith and Kidd in the ring {{at different points in}} the match, wearing them down. Natalya interfered by tripping up Jericho while The Miz had the referee distracted. The Hart Dynasty were able to <b>capitalise,</b> and performed the Hart Attack on The Miz for the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{continued}} his good form {{at the start}} of the 195455 season, scoring 90 and 9 in the opening match against New South Wales. He then made 49 and 9 against the touring England cricket team of Len Hutton. In the Christmas match against South Australia, Harvey failed to <b>capitalise</b> on his starts, making 31 and 35 as Queensland won by 34 runs. The following week, he made only 0 and 3 not out in the New Year’s match against New South Wales. He finished the truncated season with only 16 in the following match against Victoria, ending the summer with 242 runs at 30.25.|$|E
5|$|In {{the return}} match against Queensland, Harvey made 17 as Victoria took a convincing innings win. In the next match against New South Wales, Harvey played with Neil {{for the first}} time at {{first-class}} level, and pair played together for their state’s two remaining matches of the season, although they never batted together as Merv was always out before Neil came in, usually at No. 6. Merv made 30 and 44, failing to <b>capitalise</b> on his starts to make a big score with a Test vacancy beckoning; incumbent opener Sid Barnes was injured and unavailable for the Fourth Test.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{computer}} programming languages offer facilities for converting text {{to a form}} in which all words are <b>capitalised.</b> Visual Basic calls this [...] "proper case"; Python calls it [...] "title case". This differs from usual title casing conventions, such as the English convention in which minor words are not <b>capitalised.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When sorting noble - {{as well as}} non-noble - {{names in}} {{alphabetic}} sequence, any prepositions or (former) title are ignored. [...] Name elements which have developed from honorary functions, such as Schenk (short for Mundschenk, i.e., [...] "cup-bearer"), are also overlooked. Nobiliary particles are not <b>capitalised</b> unless they begin a sentence, and then they are usually skipped, unless this creates confusion. In this, the German language practice differs from Dutch in the Netherlands, where the particle van is usually <b>capitalised</b> when mentioned without preceding given names or initials, or from Dutch in Belgium, where the name particle Van is always <b>capitalised.</b>|$|R
5|$|Merritt {{brought the}} score to 59–35 with her seventh scoring shot. As the game {{drew to a}} close, there were several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Hill, but Mexico was unable to <b>capitalise</b> on the opportunities, {{continuing}} to miss shots and turn over the ball. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Hill took a two-point shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, her team lost to Australia 62–37.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June, the division's {{defensive}} {{positions at}} Minqar Qaim were encircled by the 21st Panzer Division. The battalion {{was the lead}} unit {{of one of the}} columns, numbering 900 vehicles and guns, of the division, in the subsequent breakout that night. In the course of this movement, Gray's column ran into an encampment of tanks of the 21st Panzer Division. However, the Germans failed to <b>capitalise</b> on the opportunity and the train of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it did not come to a stop, was able to skirt the panzers with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the final}} {{decision}} on {{the location of the}} new capital territory, the local landowners and residents of Queanbeyan looked favourably on the possibility of having the territory located nearby. Such a result, it was hoped, would bring improvements to local infrastructure, increase the demand for local goods and services, and raise land values. It was assumed that the existing freehold arrangements would remain, and that those whose land was not required for the city itself would {{be in a position to}} <b>capitalise</b> on the new circumstances.|$|E

5000|$|As in English, an {{apostrophe}} {{is used to}} mark {{omission of}} a part of word or several words:Except in all caps, the letter immediately following a word-initial apostrophe is not <b>capitalised.</b> If necessary, the second word is <b>capitalised</b> instead: [...] "'s Avonds is zij nooit thuis." [...] (She is never {{at home in the}} evening.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The quick brown fox {{jumps over}} the lazy dog." [...] The {{standard}} case used in English prose.

5|$|The former RAAF Fairbairn, {{adjacent}} to the Canberra Airport was sold to the operators of the airport, but the base continues {{to be used for}} RAAF VIP flights. A growing number of software vendors have based themselves in Canberra, to <b>capitalise</b> on the concentration of government customers; these include Tower Software and RuleBurst. A consortium of private and government investors is currently making plans for a billion-dollar data hub, with the aim of making Canberra a leading centre of such activity in the Asia-Pacific region.|$|E
5|$|To {{reinforce}} {{the connection with}} Love's Last Shift and <b>capitalise</b> on its unexpected success, Vanbrugh designed the central roles of Loveless, Amanda, and Sir Novelty for the same actors: John Verbruggen, Jane Rogers, and Colley Cibber. Keeping Rogers as Amanda was not a problem, since she was not an actress that the companies fought over, but holding on to John Verbruggen and Colley Cibber posed challenges, to which Rich rose with energetic campaigns of bribery and re-seduction. Filling {{the rest of the}} large Relapse cast presented a varied palette of problems, which forced some unconventional emergency casting.|$|E
5|$|Toshack had a {{moderately}} successful Third Test, in which England elected to bat first. England lost two early wickets, and when Toshack came on, Jack Crapp repeatedly defended {{a sequence of}} deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point. As the hosts were in trouble, they played cautiously and Toshack's first five overs were all maidens. Crapp then hit Toshack to Sid Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not <b>capitalise</b> as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs.|$|E

5|$|Venables brought Gary Lineker {{back from}} Barcelona, and Stewart was {{selected}} to be Lineker's striker partner for the 1989–90 season, leaving Walsh on the bench. An injury to Stewart gave Walsh the chance to win back his first team place, and he marked {{his return to the}} first team with the winning goal in a 2–1 victory over rivals Arsenal, though failed to <b>capitalise</b> on this performance and again was dropped. Later in the season he had to be taken off at half-time against Wimbledon as he had a long night of drinking with George Best the previous night. He ended the campaign with three goals from 13 starts and 18 substitute appearances.|$|E
5|$|West Ham {{kicked the}} match off, as both teams {{lined up in}} a 4–4–2 formation. West Ham {{committed}} the first foul of the match in the first minute as Paul Konchesky brought down Steven Gerrard, but Liverpool were unable to <b>capitalise</b> on the resulting free kick. A few minutes later, West Ham midfielder Yossi Benayoun advanced down the right hand side of the pitch and passed {{the ball into the}} penalty area, but Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä was able to intercept the ball before Ashton or Harewood received it. Harewood had the first shot on goal for West Ham in the 12th minute, but it was deflected out for a corner.|$|E
5|$|After being {{handed the}} number 10 shirt and Italy's playmaking duties, much was {{expected}} of Totti in his debut World Cup under manager Giovanni Trapattoni. Despite a promising start at the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and Korea, as he set-up Christian Vieri's first goal in Italy's 2–0 opening win over Ecuador, disappointment followed, with Totti failing to score or make a significant impact throughout the tournament. Despite helping to set up Vieri's goal in a disappointing and controversial 2–1 defeat to Croatia in Italy's second group match, his lacklustre performances throughout the tournament were later criticised by the Italian media, in particular his failure to <b>capitalise</b> on several scoring chances in Italy's 1–1 draw against Mexico in their final group match, as Italy only narrowly qualified for the knockout stage.|$|E

50|$|Many {{previous}} {{systems of}} Tibetan transliteration included internal capitalisation schemes—essentially, <b>capitalising</b> the root letter {{rather than the}} first letter of a word, when the first letter is a prefix consonant. Tibetan dictionaries are organized by root letter, and prefixes are often silent, so knowing the root letter gives {{a better idea of}} pronunciation. However, these schemes were often applied inconsistently, and usually only when the word would normally be <b>capitalised</b> according to the norms of Latin text (i.e. {{at the beginning of a}} sentence). On the grounds that internal capitalisation was overly cumbersome, of limited usefulness in determining pronunciation, and probably superfluous to a reader able to use a Tibetan dictionary, Wylie specified that if a word was to be <b>capitalised,</b> the first letter should be capital, in conformity with Western capitalisation practices. Thus a particular Tibetan Buddhist sect (Kagyu) is <b>capitalised</b> Bka' brgyud and not bKa' brgyud.|$|R
