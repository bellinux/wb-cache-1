5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus <b>congestus</b> or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus <b>congestus</b> clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, as they can be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterspout}} is {{an intense}} columnar vortex (usually appearing as a funnel-shaped cloud) that occurs over {{a body of}} water. Some are connected to a cumulus <b>congestus</b> cloud, some to a cumuliform cloud and some to a cumulonimbus cloud. In the common form, it is a non-supercell tornado over water.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus clouds come in four {{distinct}} species, cumulis humilis, mediocris, <b>congestus,</b> and fractus. These {{species may}} be arranged into the variety, cumulus radiatus; {{and may be}} accompanied by up to seven supplementary features, cumulus pileus, velum, virga, praecipitatio, arcus, pannus, and tuba.|$|E
5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus <b>congestus).</b> It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain {{area for a}} relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species <b>congestus.</b> Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus {{over the top of}} the cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing <b>congestus</b> or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and cirrocumulus. (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many of the}} Senecio genus S. <b>congestus</b> can be {{an annual}} or {{biennial}} and perhaps rarely perennial, depending on the conditions.|$|E
25|$|Cape Churchill Region and La Pérouse Bay, Manitoba {{where the}} {{expanding}} population of lesser snow geese {{has resulted in}} substantial changes to all intertidal habitats. In {{the vicinity of the}} coast extensive moss carpets are present and Senecio <b>congestus</b> and Salicornia borealis are widespread.|$|E
25|$|With highly {{unstable}} atmospheric conditions, large cumulus {{may continue}} to grow into cumulonimbus calvus (essentially a very tall <b>congestus</b> cloud that produces thunder), then ultimately into the species capillatus when supercooled water droplets {{at the top of}} the cloud turn into ice crystals giving it a cirriform appearance.|$|E
25|$|Karrak Lake, Nunavut where {{growth in}} populations of Ross's geese (Chen rossii) and lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens) {{has led to}} a decline in {{vegetative}} cover and areas with a 10-year or longer history of goose nesting than in areas with less than 10 years of nesting had more instance of exposed mineral substrate, exposed peat, and Senecio <b>congestus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Seeds: Typical of the Senecio genus, S. <b>congestus</b> {{produces}} strongly accrescent one-seeded, one-celled, 1.5 to 2.5 millimetres long dry achenes on {{very fine}} & numerous, white or dirty white, fluffy, pappus bristles. The seeds {{have been shown}} to survive in the soil {{for more than a year}} but less than 5 years, the maximum longevity unknown.|$|E
25|$|Senecio <b>congestus,</b> {{also known}} by its common names swamp ragwort, {{northern}} swamp groundsel, marsh fleabane, marsh fleawort, clustered marsh ragwort and mastodon flower, a herbaceous member of the Asteraceae family and the Senecio genus, can be seen most easily when its bright yellow umbel flowers appear from May to early July standing 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) along marshes, stream banks and slough areas where it likes to grow.|$|E
25|$|More general airmass {{instability}} in the troposphere tends to produce clouds of the more freely convective cumulus genus type, whose species are mainly indicators of degrees of atmospheric instability and resultant vertical development of the clouds. A cumulus cloud initially forms in {{the low level of}} the troposphere as a cloudlet of the species humilis that shows only slight vertical development. If the air becomes more unstable, the cloud tends to grow vertically into the species mediocris, then <b>congestus,</b> the tallest cumulus species which is the same type that the International Civil Aviation Organization refers to as 'towering cumulus'.|$|E
25|$|Frontal and {{cyclonic}} lift {{occur when}} stable air is forced aloft at weather fronts and around centers of low pressure. Warm fronts associated with extratropical cyclones tend to generate mostly cirriform and stratiform clouds {{over a wide}} area unless the approaching warm airmass is unstable, in which case cumulus <b>congestus</b> or cumulonimbus clouds will usually be embedded in the main precipitating cloud layer. Cold fronts are usually faster moving and generate a narrower line of clouds which are mostly stratocumuliform, cumuliform, or cumulonimbiform depending on {{the stability of the}} warm air mass just ahead of the front.|$|E
25|$|When the {{precipitation}} {{reaches the}} ground without completely evaporating, it is {{designated as the}} feature praecipitatio. This normally occurs with altostratus opacus, which can produce widespread but usually light precipitation, and with thicker clouds that show significant vertical development. Of the latter, upward-growing cumulus mediocris produces only isolated light showers, while downward growing nimbostratus is capable of heavier, more extensive precipitation. Towering vertical clouds have the greatest ability to produce intense precipitation events, but these tend to be localized unless organized along fast-moving cold fronts. Showers of moderate to heavy intensity can fall from cumulus <b>congestus</b> clouds. Cumulonimbus, the largest of all cloud genera, {{has the capacity to}} produce very heavy showers. Low stratus clouds usually produce only light precipitation, but this always occurs as the feature praecipitatio due to the fact this cloud genus lies too close to the ground to allow for the formation of virga.|$|E
500|$|Due to reflectivity, clouds {{cool the}} earth by around , an effect largely caused by {{stratocumulus}} clouds. However, {{at the same}} time, they heat the earth by around [...] by reflecting emitted radiation, an effect largely caused by cirrus clouds. This averages out to {{a net loss of}} [...] Cumulus clouds, on the other hand, have a variable effect on heating the earth's surface. The more vertical cumulus <b>congestus</b> species and cumulonimbus genus of clouds grow high into the atmosphere, carrying moisture with them, which can lead to the formation of cirrus clouds. The researchers speculated that this might even produce a positive feedback, where the increasing upper atmospheric moisture further warms the earth, resulting in an increasing number of cumulus <b>congestus</b> clouds carrying more moisture into the upper atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|Cumulonimbus {{clouds are}} the final form of growing cumulus clouds. They form when cumulus <b>congestus</b> clouds develop a strong updraft that propels their tops {{higher and higher}} into the {{atmosphere}} until they reach the tropopause at [...] in altitude. Cumulonimbus clouds, commonly called thunderheads, can produce high winds, torrential rain, lightning, gust fronts, waterspouts, funnel clouds, and tornadoes. They commonly have anvil clouds.|$|E
500|$|Cumulo- means [...] "heap" [...] or [...] "pile" [...] in Latin. Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{described}} as [...] "puffy", [...] "cotton-like" [...] or [...] "fluffy" [...] in appearance, and have flat bases. Cumulus clouds, being low-level clouds, are generally less than 2,000m (6,600ft) in altitude unless they are the more vertical cumulus <b>congestus</b> form. Cumulus clouds may appear by themselves, in lines, or in clusters.|$|E
500|$|The species Cumulus fractus is ragged in {{appearance}} and can form in clear air as {{a precursor to}} cumulus humilis and larger cumulus species-types; or it can form in precipitation as the supplementary feature pannus (also called scud) which can also include stratus fractus of bad weather. Cumulus humilis clouds look like puffy, flattened shapes. Cumulus mediocris clouds look similar, except that they have some vertical development. Cumulus <b>congestus</b> clouds have a cauliflower-like structure and tower high into the atmosphere, hence their alternate name [...] "towering cumulus". The variety Cumulus radiatus forms in radial bands called cloud streets and can comprise {{any of the four}} species of cumulus.|$|E
500|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} a genus of free-convective low-étage cloud {{along with the}} related limited-convective {{cumuliform}} or stratocumuliform cloud stratocumulus. These clouds form from ground level to [...] at all latitudes. Stratus clouds are also low-étage. In the middle étage are the alto clouds, which consist of the limiited-convective cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud altocumulus and the stratiform cloud altostratus. Middle-étage clouds form from [...] to [...] in polar areas, [...] in temperate areas, and [...] in tropical areas. The high-étage clouds are all cirriform, one of which, cirrocumulus, is also cumuliform of limited convection or stratocumuliform. The other clouds in this étage are cirrus and cirrostratus. High-étage clouds form [...] in high latitudes, [...] in temperate latitudes, and [...] in low, tropical latitudes. Cumulonimbus clouds, like cumulus <b>congestus,</b> extend vertically rather than remaining confined to one étage.|$|E
500|$|A {{waterspout}} {{is defined}} by the National Weather Service as a tornado over water. However, researchers typically distinguish [...] "fair weather" [...] waterspouts from tornadic waterspouts. Fair weather waterspouts are less severe but far more common, and are similar to dust devils and landspouts. They form at the bases of cumulus <b>congestus</b> clouds over tropical and subtropical waters. They have relatively weak winds, smooth laminar walls, and typically travel very slowly. They occur most commonly in the Florida Keys and in the northern Adriatic Sea. In contrast, tornadic waterspouts are stronger tornadoes over water. They form over water similarly to mesocyclonic tornadoes, or are stronger tornadoes which cross over water. Since they form from severe thunderstorms and can be far more intense, faster, and longer-lived than fair weather waterspouts, they are more dangerous. In official tornado statistics, waterspouts are generally not counted unless they affect land, though some European weather agencies count waterspouts and tornadoes together.|$|E

The leaves all basically similar in shape, oblong with the lower ones often spatulate, 1.6 to 8inches (4 to 20cm) long, 0.2 to 2.5 in (0.5 to 6cm) wide, with the basal leaves occasionally larger, glabrous or villous in patches, rounded at the tips, toothed, often deciduous with clasping bases.|$|E
2500|$|The genitus and mutatus {{categories}} {{have been}} {{expanded to include}} certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds. The term flammagenitus (Latin for 'fire-made') applies to cumulus <b>congestus</b> or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions. Smaller low-level [...] "pyrocumulus" [...] or [...] "fumulus" [...] clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus homogenitus (Latin for 'man-made'). Contrails formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling any of the high cloud genus-types and are now officially designated as cirrus, cirrostratus, or cirrocumulus homogenitus. If a homogenitus cloud of one genus changes to another genus type, it is then termed a homomutatus cloud. Stratus cataractagenitus (Latin for 'cataract-made') are generated by the spray from waterfalls. [...] Silvagenitus (Latin for 'forest-made') is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor {{is added to the}} air above a forest canopy.|$|E
2500|$|These clouds {{have low}} to middle level bases that form {{anywhere}} from near surface to about [...] and tops that can extend {{into the high}} altitude range. [...] Nimbostratus and some cumulus in this group usually achieve moderate or deep vertical extent, but without towering structure. [...] However, with sufficient airmass instability, upward-growing cumuliform clouds can grow to high towering proportions. [...] Although genus types with vertical extent are often informally considered a single group, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) distinguishes towering vertical clouds more formally as a separate group or sub-group. [...] It is specified that these very large cumuliform and cumulonimbiform types must be identified by their standard names or abbreviations in all aviation observations (METARS) and forecasts (TAFS) to warn pilots of possible severe weather and turbulence. [...] Multi-level clouds are of even larger structure than low clouds, and are therefore identifiable by their forms and genera, (and even species {{in the case of}} cumulus <b>congestus)</b> using satellite photography.|$|E
