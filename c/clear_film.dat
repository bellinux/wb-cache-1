500|$|L.A. Woman was {{released}} on April 19, 1971. It reached number nine on the Billboard 200, remaining on the charts for 36 weeks, and reached number 28 in the UK, spending four weeks on the UK Albums Charts. The first cover pressing had a burgundy-colored, curved-corner cardboard cutout sleeve, framing a clear embossed cellophane insert, glued in from behind. Photography was credited to Wendell Hamick. According to Jac Holzman, {{chief executive officer of}} Elektra Records: [...] "I wasn't sure there would be another album ever, so I had Bill Harvey create a collector's cover. The Doors' faces were printed on <b>clear</b> <b>film.</b> The backing color of the inner sleeve could be changed and would affect the mood of the package. This is the first album in which Jim is bearded [...] His photo is on the right, no bigger, no smaller than the others, just another guy in the band." ...|$|E

40|$|Plasma {{polymerized}} vinyltrimethoxy silane {{films were}} deposited on transparent polycarbonate substrates. The adherent, <b>clear</b> <b>films</b> protected the substrates from abrasion and {{also served as}} antireflection coatings. Posttreatment of the vinyltrimethoxy silane films in an oxygen glow discharge further improved the abrasion resistance. ESCA (electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis) and IR transmission spectra of some films were recorded, and an elemental analysis of the films was obtained...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the type of}} photoinitiator, type of polymerizable reactive diluent and added amine synergist on the yellowing which occurs during the curing of <b>clear</b> <b>films</b> is examined. Type I photoinitiators based on acetophenone give rise to the least yellowing. The presence of amines, such as N-methyldiethanolamine, increases yellowing to a noticeable extent. Amino groups present in the initiator or the reactive diluent lead to marked yellowing. The chemistry responsible for the yellowing is explored...|$|R
50|$|Protection from UV {{light can}} be {{accomplished}} by film that addresses only the UV spectrum. As UV {{is one of the main}} sources of fading, it can prolong the life of fixtures and fittings. Basic colorless <b>clear</b> <b>films</b> reject (absorbs) some UV radiation up to 380 nm, and depending on the manufacturer, UV inhibitors are added to the polyester, with specialist films offering protection to 400 nm. Tinted films are necessary for protection to 500 nm.|$|R

40|$|Phenolphthalein {{polycarbonate}} {{was successfully}} plasticized with polychlorinated biphenyls (e. g., Aroclor 1231) or tricresyl phosphate and cast from tetrahydrofuran to give <b>clear</b> <b>films</b> without loss of fire resistance. At loadings of 20 to 30 percent plasticizer the Tg was lowered to approximately 100 C which would render phenolphthalein polycarbonate easily moldable. Although these materials had some mechanical integrity {{as shown by}} their film forming ability, the room temperature toughness of the plasticized polymer was not significantly improved over unmodified polymer...|$|R

40|$|A {{new family}} of high performance, {{miscible}} polymer blends based on aromatic polybenzimidazoles and aromatic polyimides has been discovered. Preliminary evidence, obtained with commercially available, soluble poly­mers suggests that polymers of these generic types may be miscible {{over a wide}} range of compositions and structural variations. Blend miscibility was evidenced in the form of single Tg 2 ̆ 7 s and well-defined single tan 6 relaxations intermediate to those of the component polymers, the formation of <b>clear</b> <b>films</b> and, in one case, enhanced solvent resistance...|$|R
5000|$|The Garden of Earthly Delights, like Brakhage's earlier Mothlight, is {{considered}} a [...] "collage film." [...] It was created {{without the use of}} a camera, by pasting montane zone vegetation, such as petals, grasses and leaves, onto strips of <b>clear</b> <b>film</b> leader. Brakhage intended the film as [...] "an homage to (but also argument with) Hieronymous Bosch." ...|$|E
5000|$|Silicone greases {{are used}} for many purposes, such as bicycle chains, airsoft gun parts, and {{a wide range of}} other mechanisms. Typically, a dry-set {{lubricant}} is delivered with a solvent carrier to penetrate the mechanism. The solvent then evaporates, leaving a <b>clear</b> <b>film</b> that lubricates but does not attract dirt and grit as much as an oil-based or other traditional [...] "wet" [...] lubricant.|$|E
50|$|The {{membrane}} is the <b>clear</b> <b>film</b> {{lining the}} eggshell, visible when one peels a boiled egg. Eggshell membrane is primarily composed of fibrous proteins such as collagen type I. However, eggshell membranes {{have also been}} shown to contain glycosaminoglycans, such as dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate and sulfated glycoproteins including hexosamines, such as glucosamine. Other components identified in eggshell membranes are hyaluronic acid, sialic acid, desmosine and isodesmosine, ovotransferrin, lysyl oxidase, lysozyme, and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase.|$|E
50|$|P. mirabilis can use urea. It {{can produce}} {{hydrogen}} sulfide gas, and forms <b>clear</b> <b>films</b> on growth media. It is motile, possessing peritrichous flagella, {{and is known}} for its swarming ability. It is commonly found in the intestinal tracts of humans. P. mirabilis is not pathogenic in guinea pigs or chickens. Noteworthy is the ability of this species to inhibit growth of unrelated strains, resulting in a macroscopically visible line of reduced bacterial growth where two swarming strains intersect. This line is named the Dienes line after its discoverer Louis Dienes.|$|R

Specifically, feasibility {{for the development}} of <b>clear</b> <b>films</b> for new decorative laminates, compression moldings, injection molded parts, thermoformed plastic parts, and flexible foams were given primary considerations. Preliminary data on the flame resistant characteristics of the materials were obtained. Preliminary toxicity data were generated from samples of materials submitted from the contractor.

50|$|Paint Protection Film (PPF) is a {{thermoplastic}} urethane film {{applied to}} painted surfaces {{of a new}} or used car {{in order to protect}} the paint from stone chips, bug splatters, and minor abrasions. This film is also used on airplanes, RVs, cell phones, electronics, screens, motorcycles and many other areas. Paint Protection Film is OEM approved by virtually all car manufacturers. Paint protection film is commonly referred to as clear bra, <b>clear</b> <b>film,</b> clear paint film, PPF and other names.|$|E
5000|$|... ‘On Space Time Foam’, an {{installation}} by Saraceno and curated by Andrea Lissoni, {{was inspired by}} the cubic shape of the exhibition space at HangarBicocca, Milan, appearing there in 2013. The structure was composed of three levels of thin, <b>clear</b> <b>film</b> fixed to the walls and floating at a height of 14 to 20 metres, covering an area of 400 square metres. Visitors were granted access to three levels of the artwork, finding themselves in mid-air, encouraging the loss of spatial coordination. HangarBicocca has a cubic form.|$|E
5000|$|Stockbooks {{consist of}} a number of stiff pages, made up with {{horizontal}} pockets of manilla paper, glassine paper or <b>clear</b> <b>film,</b> into which stamps are placed. Collectors can insert stamps side by side in a row or can overlap stamps when individual viewing is not necessary. The pages, usually double-sided, are bound into book form. The most popular sizes comprise between 4 and 32 double-sided pages with each page interleaved with a glassine, or clear, sheet to prevent stamps on adjacent pages from touching.|$|E

40|$|Amorphous {{diamond-like}} carbon (DLC) films were deposited using both single and dual ion beam techniques utilizing filament and hollow cathode ion sources. Continuous DLC films up to 3000 A thick were deposited on fused quartz plates. Ion beam process parameters were varied {{in an effort}} to create hard, <b>clear</b> <b>films.</b> Total DLC film absorption over visible wavelengths was obtained using a Perkin-Elmer spectrophotometer. An ellipsometer, with an Ar-He laser (wavelength 6328 A) was used to determine index of refraction for the DLC films. Scratch resistance, frictional, and adherence properties were determined for select films. Applications for these films range from military to the ophthalmic industries...|$|R
