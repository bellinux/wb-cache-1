40|$|AbstractMonitoring drill wear {{is a major}} {{topic in}} {{automated}} manufacturing operations. This paper presents an effective drill wear feature identification scheme based on robust clustering techniques. Three types of drill wear (namely; chisel wear, <b>chipped</b> <b>edge</b> and flank wear) are artificially induced on the drill point. The drill cutting edge wear related features are extracted experimentally by processing the force signals from a three-axis piezoelectric load cell in both the time and frequency domains. Techniques based on the short time Fourier transform (STFT), wavelet transform (WT) and statistical parameters are utilized for feature extraction. The sensitivity of the proposed method is tested under different cutting feed and speed conditions. The computational study is conducted using the features extracted from three dimensional vibration and cutting force signals. The type of drill wear and related variations in the cutting forces are identified using robust clustering methods. The objective is to isolate regions in the feature space, each region corresponding {{to one of the}} drill wear types. Results show that power spectral density data clusters better than data obtained using wavelet coefficients. The clustering results can be used to design classifiers for real time monitoring of wear conditions while drilling...|$|E
40|$|The {{personnel}} at Prestressed Systems Incorporated (PSI) suspected {{that use of}} the zero slump test cylinders to measure the compressive strength of hollowcore concrete was not reliable. If a test cylinder failed only by a <b>chipped</b> <b>edge</b> while being tested for compressive strength, it was not useful for determining the time at which the prestressing force in the tendons can be transferred into the bed of hollowcore. A more reliable method was sought to quantify the compressive strength of zero slump concrete {{at the time of}} tendon release. The method should also provide real-time information on the progress of concrete strength development and result in savings associated with the mix design, labour and accelerated curing energy optimization. A non-destructive Maturity Method has been proven effective in other studies focused on determining compressive strength of concrete. This research describes the implementation of the Maturity Method in the precast hollowcore plant at PSI. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

40|$|Getting {{output of}} {{multiple}} chips within {{the volume of}} a single chip {{is the driving force}} behind development of this novel 3 D integration technology, which has a broad range of industrial and medical electronic applications. This goal is achieved in a two-step approach. At first thinned dies are embedded in a polyimide interposer with a fine-pitch metal fan-out resulting Ultra-Thin Chip Packages (UTCP), next these UTCPs are stacked by lamination. Step height at the <b>chip</b> <b>edge</b> of these UTCPs is the major reason of die cracking during the lamination. This paper contains an approach to solve this issue by introduction of an additional layer of interposer which makes it flat at the <b>chip</b> <b>edge</b> and thus the whole packages is named as “Flat-UTCP”. In addition to that, randomness in non-functional package positions per panel reduces the overall yield of the whole process up to certain extent. A detailed analysis on these two issues to improve the process yield is presented in this paper. 3 D-stacked memory module composed of 4 EEPROM dies was processed and tested to demonstrate this new concept for enhancing the fabrication yield...|$|R
40|$|Chip {{design in}} {{submicron}} processes will present new challenges and problems {{which were not}} present in designs with larger dimension processes. One effect in the newer processes is the field oxide thickness variation due to interconnect density variations. This effect becomes much more extreme for the smaller dimension processes. Large density discontinuities can cause lower yield and will also result in capacitor value mismatch over substantial distances from the edges of a large array when using poly/metal capacitors. If good matching {{in this type of}} large area capacitor array is required, the only way to achieve this is to guarantee nearly constant metal/ poly density for at least 1500 microns (this distance will likely depend on the process) {{around the edges of the}} array. If the array boundary is close to the <b>chip</b> <b>edge,</b> then dummy capacitors should be placed up to the <b>chip</b> <b>edge,</b> and another layout with similar density must be placed as close as possible to the relevant <b>edges</b> of the <b>chip</b> in the reticle. When using a standard MOSIS reticle size, this may entail placing dummy chip layouts around the chips of interest in order to guarantee that identical density exists for the required distance outside of any chip�s borders...|$|R

In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) model is developed to study the effects of three parameters (cutting depth, support length, and pretightening load) on the maximum normal stress and von Mises stress in the region where the <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> initiates. Two failure criteria (the maximum normal stress criterion and von Mises stress criterion) were used to predict the relation between the <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> thickness and the support length. Furthermore, a solution to reduce the <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> is proposed based upon the FEA simulations and verified by experiments...|$|R

To minimize <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> of the machined glass, which is common when cutting materials harder than 50 HRC, adopting right parameters is required followed by additional effort and cost.

Hole machining is the most frequently employed operation of secondary machining for fiber-reinforced composites.
