50|$|Chapters 4-12 {{are devoted}} to Aristotle’s own theory that essence is the <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> <b>substantiality.</b> The essence of {{something}} is what is included in a secundum se ('according to itself') account of a thing, i.e. which tells what a thing is by its very nature. You are not musical by your very nature. But you are a human by your very nature. Your essence is what is mentioned {{in the definition of}} you.|$|E

50|$|The term 'original' also {{involves}} a test <b>of</b> <b>substantiality</b> - literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works {{will not be}} original if {{there has not been}} sufficient skill and labour expended in their creation.

50|$|The Court of Appeal erred in its {{understanding}} of the visual comparison. The question <b>of</b> <b>substantiality</b> addresses whether the copied feature is {{a substantial part of}} the copyrighted work. It may not be a substantial part of the defendant's work. Therefore, even if the defendant's design looked different from Ixia, {{it does not mean that}} the copyright was not infringed.|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the Kiev’s period of {{creative}} work of V. V. Zenkovsky, re-markable Christian philosopher, psychologist and pedagogue. The main point of interest of the thinker of that time was a philosophical psychology, i. e. a branch of science direct-ed to the source of psychics and seeking to make clear the nature and basis of mental re-ality. Zenkovsky’s defense of the idea <b>of</b> <b>substantiality</b> <b>of</b> soul and original interpretation of the problem of psychophysical interaction brought him to the deep reform of meta-physical background of psychology. This also became the conceptual basis for his latest investigations in the spheres of pedagogy, theology and pure philosoph...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new {{perspective}} on knowledge metaphorical analysis: knowledge as a field. The concept of field is taken from physics, where it is defined as an intangible continuum of forces generated by a specific tangible object. This perspective overcomes the limits of the previous interpretations of knowledge as stuff or flow, especially the limits <b>of</b> <b>substantiality</b> and linearity. In the new perspective knowledge is conceived as a nonsubstantial entity, nonuniform, nonhomogeneous and nonlinear. Thus, we open new opportunities for understanding knowledge and its organizational dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Now that Australia has {{its long}} awaited {{legislation}} protecting the moral rights of authors, {{a new phase}} {{in the development of}} the rights begins. It must be asked how the incorporation of the rights into the existing copyright legislation, and their subjection to existing doctrines, will affect their operation. And how will existing doctrines be challenged and extended by the existence of the rights? Ultimately these questions will be worked out in the courts. The present article offers a consideration of one area where the legislature has purported to integrate moral rights into the existing scheme but where the practicalities oftheir integration are still unclear. It examines the interplay of moral rights with the doctrine <b>of</b> <b>substantiality,</b> suggesting that any clarification <b>of</b> what <b>substantiality</b> means in the moral rights context will be contingent upon the emergence of more precise definitions of what moral rights are and what interests they are intended to protect. <br /...|$|R

Melbury seldom saw Winterborne now, but he believed him to be occupying a lonely hut just beyond the boundary of Mrs. Charmond's estate, though still within the circuit of the woodland.

40|$|The {{definition}} of a unitary business has figured prominently in several recent decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court on the constitutionality of state corporate income taxes. This paper employs economic analysis to frame a three part test of whether a unitary business exists. Underlying the tests {{is the notion that}} a unitary business exists when separate accounting can not satisfactorily isolate the profits of individual firms. The first test is common control. The second is whether transfer prices on transactions within the group could be manipulated or are diificult to verify or substantial vertical integration, shared costs,economies of scale or scope, or other forms of economic interdependence make isolation of profits of affiliated firms impossible. The third test is one <b>of</b> <b>substantiality.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the meaning and}} application of the concept <b>of</b> <b>substantiality</b> for consumer market segmentation and target selection {{with a focus on}} ethnicity and minority ethnic groups. In contrast with interpretations of segment substance anchoring on some sufficient potential size to justify time and effort involved in planning, the objective is to consider key group dimensions to ascertain potential substantiality. Common criteria proposed to assess substance are essentially an exhortation to assess the value of the segmenting opportunity. An increase in producer surplus meets this requirement but this consideration is done post hoc. The challenge for market segmentation is to assess substantiality a priori. This paper presents a screening approach based on appraising minority ethnic group resources that enables such an assessment and has potential applicability to other consumer subcultures.

40|$|The first {{element of}} private {{nuisance}} is an “interference substantial in nature. ” This {{leads to the}} question: what is substantial? Whether interference is substantial depends largely on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. The determination <b>of</b> <b>substantiality</b> is generally a question of fact for a jury {{as opposed to a}} question of law for the judge to decide. Substantiality, involves a review of the totality of the circumstances based on a balancing of the rights of the Respondent to use his or her property against the rights of the Petitioner to enjoy their property. The balancing basically amounts to a risk-utility analysis weighing the social value of the conduct involved against the harm to the private interest. Therefore, in order to be successful in your private nuisance action you must prove that the social value of the nuisance is outweighed the harm to you...|$|R

40|$|Globalization {{challenges}} {{the effectiveness of}} market segmentation, requiring action to reinvigorate segmentation approaches to selecting targetable segments. A particular issue is the identification of homogeneous, substantial segments. This paper argues that an approach for identifying ethnic minority markets can be more widely applied to subcultural groups in general. The meaning and application of the concept <b>of</b> <b>substantiality</b> for consumer market segmentation and target selection is analysed. In contrast with subjective interpretations of segment substance anchored on some sufficient potential size to justify time and effort involved in planning, {{the objective is to}} ascertain potential substantiality by considering key group dimensions indicative of its potential. Common tests of substance are shown to be essentially an exhortation to evaluate the value of the segmenting opportunity and the need to be consistent with achieving these objectives. While an increase in producer surplus meets this requirement, it is a post hoc consideration or, at least, greatly dependent on the quality of forecasting. The greater challenge for market segmentation is to assess substantiality a priori. The screening approach developed in this paper based on appraising group resources enables such an assessment and has potential applicability to other subcultures...|$|R

I argue that the criterion fails to meet four of the conditions of adequacy for a <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> empirical signiﬁcance that follow from Sober’s position or are presumed in his arguments. I suggest to deﬁne empirical signiﬁcance as empirical non-equivalence to a tautology, because this deﬁnition does meet the conditions of adequacy. Speciﬁcally, it {{is equivalent to the}} standard Bayesian <b>criterion</b> <b>of</b> empirical signiﬁcance whenever all probabilities are deﬁned and contains falsiﬁability as a special case. This latter feature is important because those conditions of adequacy that apply to <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> deductive empirical signiﬁcance single out falsiﬁability...|$|R
