40|$|A two-year {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Michigan highbush blueberries to determine the complex of parasitoids attacking <b>cranberry</b> <b>fruitworm,</b> Acrobasis vaccinii. Eight parasitoid species and one fungal pathogen were collected. Parasitism of collected hosts ranged from 6. 6 % to 28. 1 %. The more common larval parasitoid encountered was Campoletis patsuiketorum (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). The more common parasitoid recovered from fruitworm hibernacula was Villa lateralis (Diptera: Bombyliidae). This study documented six unreported natural enemies of <b>cranberry</b> <b>fruitworm,</b> including C. patsuiketorum; V. lateralis; Diadegma compressum (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae); Compsilura concinnata (Diptera: Tachinidae); Memorilla pyste (Diptera: Tachinidae); an undescribed Microtypus species (Hymenoptera: Braconidae); and a fungal pathogen, Paecilomyces near farinosus. This is the first known host association for the undescribed Microtypus species, and increases the known parasitoid complex of <b>cranberry</b> <b>fruitworm</b> to 17 species...|$|E
40|$|Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) {{has been}} commercially {{developed}} {{since the late}} 1990 ’s in Newfoundland and Labrador. At that time, the insect fauna of the extensive stands of native, wild cranberry was not known, although these might provide a reservoir for pests to move to commercial sites. The occurrence and distribution of cranberry-feeding insects were assessed in wild stands to help cranberry growers prepare for the insect pests {{they might have to}} manage. Adults of the <b>cranberry</b> <b>fruitworm,</b> Acrobasis vaccinii were recovered in pheromone traps and larvae found in berries. The fruitworm was common and widespread. Moths of the cran-berry girdler, Chrysoteuchia topiaria were caught in pheromone traps, but larvae were not recovered from plant or soil samples. There was no evi-dence of the black-headed fireworm, Rhopobota naevana, the cranberry weevil, Anthonomus musculus, the red-headed flea beetle, Systena fron-talis, or the cranberry tipworm, Dasineura oxycoccana, serious cranberry pests in other areas.

40|$|Two {{levels of}} commercially-reared Trichogramma pretiosum were {{released}} during the oviposition {{period of the}} <b>cranberry</b> <b>fruitworm</b> (Aerobasis vaccinii) in eight Massachusetts (U. S. A.) cranberry bog sites. Release levels of 4. 8 X 105 T. pretiosum per ha or 1. 9 X 106 T. pretiosum per ha were made at 3 - 5 day intervals, {{with a total of}} nine releases. Parasitism was estimated by collecting cranberry fruits and examining them for the presence of A. vaccinii eggs and T. pretiosum. Eggs were classified as unhatched, hatched, parasitized or emegent parasite. Collections of cranberries from four 2 ̆ 7 neglected 2 ̆ 7 bog sites (not currently under cultivation) were examined and classified similarly, but T. pretiosum were not released, to determine the level of parasitism from endemic populations. Cumulative parasitism from the neglected sites was consistently higher than levels recorded from the release sites throughout the season. Parasitism in the neglected sites was determined to be from natural populations of T. pretiosum. Comparisons of cranberries damaged by A. vaccinii showed that damage was greatest in the neglected sites, but was not significantly different from fruit damage within either the low release or high release level. Collections of cranberries were also made within bog sites managed under current Massachusetts Cooperative Extension IPM guidelines. Damage to cranberries was lowest in the IPM-managed sites; although this value was less than the other bog sites, it did not differ significantly...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cranberry</b> <b>fruitworm</b> (Acrobasis vaccinii Riley), sparganothis fruitworm (Sparganothis sulfureana Clemens), and blackheaded fireworm (Rhopobota naevana Hübner) are {{historically}} significant pests of cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton) in the Upper Midwest (Wisconsin), USA. Their respective natural histories {{are well}} documented but correlations between developmental benchmarks (e. g., larval eclosion) and degree-day accruals {{are not yet}} known. Treatment timings are critical to the optimization of any given control tactic, and degree-day accrual facilitates optimization by quantifying the developmental status of pest populations. When key developmental benchmarks in the pest life cycle are linked to degree-days, real-time weather data {{can be used to}} predict precise treatment timings. Here, we provide the degree-day accumulations associated with discrete biological events (i. e., initiation of flight and peak flight) for the three most consistent moth pests of cranberries in Wisconsin. Moths were trapped each spring and summer from 2003 to 2011. To characterize flight dynamics and average timing of flight initiation, pheromone-baited trap-catch data were tallied for all three pest species within each of seven growing seasons. These flight dynamics were then associated with the corresponding degree-day accumulations generated using the cranberry plant’s developmental thresholds. Finally, models were fit to the data {{in order to determine the}} peak flight of each species. The initiation of the spring flight among all three moth species was highly synchronous, aiding in the timing of control tactics; however, there were substantial differences in the timing of peak flight among the moth species. Characterization of the relationship between temperature and pest development allows pest management professionals to target specific life stages, improving the efficacy of any given pest control tactic...|$|E
40|$|The <b>cranberry</b> <b>fruitworm,</b> Acrobasis vaccinii (Riley) (Pyralidae), is {{the most}} {{important}} insect pest of Massachusetts cranberries. The female lays her eggs individually in the calyxes of developing fruits. Upon hatching, the larva cats its way into the fruit and consumes it, whereupon it moves to another. Because the immatures are protected inside fruits, insecticides target the adult and egg stages. Growers wishing to practice integrated pest management (IPM) engage scouts to collect and check berries for eggs to determine whether spraying is warranted. However, their protocol was devised with limited knowledge of egg distribution or the relationship between eggs found and yield loss. Better understanding of the oviposition behavior of the female and of egg distributions is essential for effective monitoring. ^ The quest to optimize scouting efficiency led me to explore the physical properties of cranberries and their immediate environment in order to identify factors influencing oviposition. Mechanosensory stimuli, including surface texture, conformation, size, geoörientation, and moisture content of the oviposition substrate, are important determinants in insect oviposition site selection, comprehensively reviewed in Chapter 1. In laboratory choice experiments described in Chapter 2, I manipulated the surface texture, conformation and geöorientation of cranberries and showed that physical contact with a natural calyx is important in eliciting oviposition. In field choice experiments, I showed that females are more likely to oviposit on the uppermost berries and on berries growing in abundant foliage. ^ The balance of my research was designed to characterize the egg spatial distribution in commercial cranberry bogs and to develop an empirically-based IPM scouting protocol. Six bogs were intensively sampled and their egg distributions were modeled in Chapter 3 using Taylor 2 ̆ 7 s Power Law (Taylor, 1961), variance = a*meanb. However, exponential and logarithmic versions of the model produced different regressions. Comparisons of their performance demonstrated that exponential models usually produced more satisfactory descriptions of the variance to mean relationship. Analyses of the published data sets Taylor employed, presented in Chapter 4, obtained comparable results. In Chapter 5, I developed and tested a new scouting protocol based on the exponential model, which outperformed the original protocol in field trials. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>{{cranberry}}</b> <b>fruitworm,</b> Acrobasis vaccinii Riley (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), is {{a serious}} pest of cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.). Reported hosts also include highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), lowbush sweet blueberry (Vaccinium augustifolium Ait.), and black huckleberry [(Gaylussacia baccata (Wang.) K. Koch], all of which grow in the woodlands (called uplands) surrounding Massachusetts bogs. Since {{a thorough understanding of}} movement patterns of a pest species within and between host habitats is crucial for the implementation of a successful management program, moth movement was studied in time and space through trapping of wild and mark-released moths. The results, reported in Chapters I and II, demonstrate that the moth is very mobile and that large flights occur in both cultivated bogs and their surrounding uplands. Trap studies also showed a significant effect of trap height on the number of moths captured. Moths were active later at night in the upland, and males, in particular, were active in the trees, which suggested adoption of a “hilltopping” strategy to enhance their chances of mate finding. In field and lab studies reported in Chapter III, the periodicities of emergence, mating, and oviposition were recorded, and the data suggest that it is advantageous for females to delay mating when conditions are favorable for oviposition. Females were polyandrous, and assessment of spermatophore age in females suggested that mating may occur more frequently in the upland compared to the bog. Studies reported in Chapter IV showed that moth activity and infestation occurred earlier in both blueberry plantings and in the uplands than cranberry. The large numbers of moths captured in the uplands did not appear to originate from larvae developing in the uplands, since infestation of wild berries could not be corroborated. A study of host preference and performance in four different hosts (cultivated cranberry and blueberry, wild blueberry and huckleberry) is reported in Chapter V. Huckleberry was the least preferred for oviposition, and both of the cultivated berries were more suitable for larval development when compared to the wild hosts. The relationship between preference ranking and performance was positive. Implications of these findings are discussed. ...|$|E
