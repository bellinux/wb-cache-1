5|$|An average meal of 40-50mmol {{presents}} {{the body with}} more potassium than is present in all plasma (20-25mmol). However, this surge <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> plasma potassium to rise only 10% at most {{as a result of}} prompt and efficient clearance by both renal and extra-renal mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{nearly half}} the {{hydrogen}} at the core has been consumed, with {{the remainder of the}} atoms consisting primarily of helium. As the number of hydrogen atoms per unit mass decreases, so too does their energy output provided through nuclear fusion. This results in a decrease in pressure support, which <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> core to contract until the increased density and temperature bring the core pressure into equilibrium with the layers above. The higher temperature <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> remaining hydrogen to undergo fusion at a more rapid rate, thereby generating the energy needed to maintain the equilibrium.|$|E
50|$|Toppling {{will occur}} when the {{overturning}} moment due to the side force (centrifugal acceleration) is sufficient to <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> inner wheel to begin to lift off the rail. This may result in loss of adhesion - <b>causing</b> <b>the</b> train to slow, preventing toppling. Alternatively, the inertia may be sufficient to <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> train to continue to move at speed <b>causing</b> <b>the</b> vehicle to topple completely.|$|R

5000|$|According to Swami Sivananda, in his {{comments}} on the [...] 2.1.9, Adi Shankara describes this as follows: Despite <b>the</b> non-difference of <b>cause</b> and effect, <b>the</b> effect has its self in <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> but not <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> in <b>the</b> effect.The effect is {{of the nature of}} <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> and not <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>the</b> nature of the effect.Therefore the qualities of the effect cannot touch <b>the</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> rest of the sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects {{and there is an}} additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered {{in and out of the}} line-of-sight.|$|E
5|$|In some rare cases, {{a single}} amino acid {{change in a}} serpin's RCL alters its {{specificity}} to target the wrong protease. For example, the Antitrypsin-Pittsburgh mutation (M358R) <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> α1-antitrypsin serpin to inhibit thrombin, causing a bleeding disorder.|$|E

5|$|September 19, 2000- The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Gordon produce heavy rainfall {{for a few}} hours, resulting in rainfall totals of up to 1.82inches (46mm) in Newark.

5|$|The game is {{displayed}} on a black-and-white television screen, and the tanks are controlled by two joysticks each.

5|$|The game {{takes place}} after Raiden, Earthrealm's god of thunder, and Superman, Metropolis' defender, repel invasions from both their worlds. An attack by both Raiden and Superman {{simultaneously}} in their separate universes <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> merging of the Mortal Kombat and DC villains, Shao Kahn and Darkseid, {{resulting in the}} creation of Dark Kahn, whose mere existence <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> two universes to begin merging; if allowed to continue, it would result in the destruction of both.

50|$|The final NTSB {{report was}} issued on October 28, 2014. It states that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> was broken {{compromise}} joint bars (used to join two different sizes of rail). The joint bars, in this case, {{were found to}} have fractured and broken <b>causing</b> <b>the</b> rail joint to break completely and <b>causing</b> <b>the</b> derailment. It was also discovered that inspections of the area had noticed {{in the days before the}} accident that there was insufficient ballast under <b>the</b> joint area <b>causing</b> <b>the</b> joint to flex repeatedly as well as an excessive mismatch in railhead height. This combination <b>caused</b> <b>the</b> failure from fatigue cracking.|$|R

5|$|A less {{invasive}} {{approach is}} thoracoscopy, {{usually in the}} form of a procedure called video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). The results from VATS-based pleural abrasion are slightly worse than those achieved using thoracotomy in the short term, but produce smaller scars in the skin. Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS offers a shorter in-hospital stays, less need for postoperative pain control, and a reduced risk of lung problems after surgery. VATS may also be used to achieve chemical pleurodesis; this involves insufflation of talc, which activates an inflammatory reaction that <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> lung to adhere to the chest wall.|$|E

5|$|A local {{department}} store announces {{the formation of}} a new August holiday called Love Day intended to boost sales. The Simpsons celebrate it, but the vast amount of packaging it produces <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> garbage to build up. When Homer takes it out, he fails {{to make it to the}} curb in time. As the garbage men drive away without collecting his trash, Homer angrily shouts insults at them, causing a fight that leads to the family's garbage service being cut off. Garbage gradually piles up on their front lawn and despite Marge's pleas, Homer refuses to apologize to the garbage men.|$|E
5|$|A {{nematode}} (Myrmeconema neotropicum) that infects canopy ants (Cephalotes atratus) <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> black-coloured gasters {{of workers}} to turn red. The parasite also alters the behaviour of the ant, {{causing them to}} carry their gasters high. The conspicuous red gasters are mistaken by birds for ripe fruits, such as Hyeronima alchorneoides, and eaten. The droppings of the bird are collected by other ants and fed to their young, leading to further spread of the nematode.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure <b>causes</b> <b>the</b> water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of the ground as a spring.|$|E
