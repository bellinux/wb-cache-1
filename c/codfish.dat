5|$|In 1989, a Kakapo Recovery {{programme}} {{was developed}} and a Kakapo Recovery Group established to implement it. The New Zealand Department of Conservation replaced the Wildlife Service for this task. The first action of {{the plan was to}} relocate all the remaining kakapo to suitable islands for them to breed. None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish kakapo without rehabilitation by extensive re-vegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors. Four islands were finally chosen: Maud, Hauturu/Little Barrier, <b>Codfish</b> and Mana. Sixty-five kakapo (43 males, 22 females) were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations. Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats, stoats and weka kept appearing. Little Barrier Island was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape, the thick forest and the continued presence of rats, and its birds were evacuated in 1998. Along with Mana Island, it was replaced with two new kakapo sanctuaries, Chalky Island (Te Kakahu) and Anchor Island. The entire kakapo population of <b>Codfish</b> Island was temporarily relocated in 1999 to Pearl Island in Port Pegasus while rats were being eliminated from <b>Codfish.</b> All kakapo on Pearl and Chalky Islands were moved to Anchor Island in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Arriving at Port Townsend, Washington, on 30 April, Yorktown put to sea on 13 May, {{arriving}} at Iliuliuk, Unalaska, one week later. Coaling there, the gunboat skirted the ice floes near the seal rookeries of the Pribilof Islands, reconnoitering the vicinity for sealers. Assisted by a revenue cutter, Yorktown guarded the passes to the Bering Sea. The crews of the patrolling American ships lacked fresh provisions but carried on {{in spite of}} the hardships imposed by both diet and climate. Fresh fish, however, proved abundant. <b>Codfish</b> was the staple with an occasional gourmet treat of salmon.|$|E
5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and <b>codfish</b> too often and they were even used as pig fodder. The highest quality cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E

5|$|The SA node {{is found}} in all amniotes but not in more {{primitive}} vertebrates. In these animals, {{the muscles of the}} heart are relatively continuous and the sinus venosus coordinates the beat which passes in a wave through the remaining chambers. Indeed, since the sinus venosus is incorporated into the right atrium in amniotes, it is likely homologous with the SA node. In teleosts, with their vestigial sinus venosus, the main centre of coordination is, instead, in the atrium. The rate of heartbeat varies enormously between different species, ranging from around 20 beats per minute in <b>codfish</b> to around 600 in hummingbirds and up to 1200 bpm in the ruby-throated hummingbird.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Puerto Rico in 1859, Betances established {{a very successful}} surgery and ophthalmology practice in Mayagüez. Even fierce political enemies such as Spanish pro-monarchy journalist José Pérez Morís regarded Betances as the best surgeon in Puerto Rico at the time. His good reputation in Puerto Rico would survive his stay in the island nation for many years. In 1895, while Betances was living in Paris, the manufacturers of the Emulsión de Scott (a <b>codfish</b> liver oil product that is still sold today, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline in modern times), paid an endorsement fee to Betances to have him appear on advertisements on Spanish language magazines and newspapers all over New York City and the Caribbean, based on his solid reputation as a doctor.|$|E
5|$|Because the kakapo is long-lived, with {{an average}} life {{expectancy}} of 58years and the maximum at about 90 years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding. Males start booming at about 5years of age. It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs. Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old. The kakapo does not breed every year and {{has one of the}} lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. Rimu mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on <b>Codfish</b> Island, kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.|$|E

40|$|<b>Codfishes,</b> of {{the order}} Gadiformes (Anacanthini), puborder Gadoidei, are {{moderate}} to deep water fishes which have a worldwide distribution. The group is best represented in temperate and cold waters, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, where it contains {{some of the most}} valuable commercial species found anywhere in the world. Predominantly bottom-dwelling omnivores, these fishes characteristically have moderately elongate bodies covered with small scales, a tail fin free from dorsal and anal fins, a dorsal fin divided into two, or three parts, pelvic fins jugular in position, all fins being without true spines. The mouth is large and terminal, the chin often has a sensory barbel. In New Zealand waters, <b>codfishes</b> are represented by six families, twelve genera, and fifteen species. Many of these are little known deep water species. Unexploited and seldom seen by New Zealand fishermen, their occurrence in our waters in any quantity has only recently become known through the reports of foreign fishing fleets. The best known of New Zealand's <b>codfishes</b> is the red cod Pseudophycis bacchus (Forster in Bloch and Schneider, 1801). Of all the cods, this species most closely resembles its northern hemisphere counterparts. Elongate with a stout body, it is distinguished from other southern species by its red-grey colour, square-cut tail, body proportions, the number of rays in its fins (first dorsal 9 - 12, second dorsal 39 - 48, anal 40 - 50, caudal 32 - 36, pectorals 22 - 26, pelvics 5 - 6), and by a black spot {{on the side of the}} body near the pectoral fins. Averaging 2 kg (to 6. 3 kg) in weight and 55 cm (to 120 cm) in length, the red cod is an active wandering marine fish with a range which extends from the shore into depths of over 750 metres (Shuntov, pers. comm.). Fast growing and of relatively short lifespan, this primarily ground-dwelling predator moves throughout the levels of the sea at times, feeding on a wide range of marine animals...|$|R

His short stocky figure was dumped stolidly as if he meant never to move again; on his thick legs and feet he wore mufflings of cloth boot, into which his patched and stained grey-blue trousers were tucked.

40|$|Worldwide {{increases}} of jellyfish has {{occurred during the}} last several decades. A dense population of a large scyphozoan jellyfish, Periphylla periphylla, has established itself as top predator in the Trondheimsfjord in Norway, impacting traditional fisheries. On this background we discuss the adaptive capacity of artisanal fishers and stakeholder involvement in environmental management. A serendipitous discovery was that fishers report that their capacity {{to adapt to the}} presence of jellyfish in fact was sufficient. What they could not adapt to, within the context of jellyfish proliferation, was top–down decisions from the national government allowing purse seiners into the fjord to harvest Sprat Sprattus sprattus and Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus rest quotas and thereby also large bycatches of the local <b>codfishes.</b> This harvest was perceived more detrimental to their fishery than was the jellyfish invasion. Relative to fisheries management’s choice of regulatory mechanisms during times of climatic change, we argue that by involving stakeholders intimately, the resulting policy advice will be experienced bottom–up and, thus, more legitimate and serendipitous results of a critical nature are more likely to surface...|$|R
40|$|Introduction <b>Codfishes</b> in the {{subfamily}} Gadinae {{are probably}} the most studied of all fishes owing to their great importanc tocJW erckj fisheries (Cohen et al. 1990). However, only two phylogenetic analyses of these fishes have been published. Dunn (1989) presented an analysis based on 28 morphologic lc harac 99 J of 11 genera (all gadine genera excra Drjagin, 1932), represented by 11 spec ies. Carr et al.

There is general agreement that the 12 genera in Gadinae (sensu Svetovidov 1948) form a monophyletic group, representing the most derived subfamily of cW]k hes. This group has been raised to family rank by several authors (e. g. Cohen 1984; Dunn 1989; Markle 1989). The assumed monophyly of the group is based on several apomorphic cph achi states...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} article {{outlines of}} {{an assessment of}} the adaptive capacity of stakeholder groups in the Trondheimsfjord region to the impacts related to local changes in Periphylla periphylla (jellyfish) concentrations. This paper addresses the interaction between the socio-ecological system and the marine ecosystem and the management challenges inherent therein by focusing on a serious management problem that is occurring in several Norwegian fjords. This is the recent superabundance of the lower trophic level jellyfish species P. periphylla, which competes with commercial Norwegian fish species {{for a wide variety of}} pelagic organisms including redfeed (Calanus finmarchicus), a key species in the coastal ecosystem and a particularly important food item for all <b>codfishes</b> in coastal waters. P. periphylla has, however, also some properties that might make it a valuable new resource in Norwegian waters, namely its potential for being a new and abundant source of collagen. The question addressed here is how to manage this jellyfish species in a manner that is rational from both socio-political and ecological perspectives, exploring stakeholder perceptions concerning their adaptation options and capacity to implement these options to this new resource and management mitigation options based on a set of stakeholder driven future scenarios.
