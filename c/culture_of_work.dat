40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} business education in producing and legitimating gendered <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in the City of London. By combining research on the gendered nature <b>of</b> service <b>work</b> with Bourdieu's identification of multiple forms of capital {{and the role of}} education credentials within this, the analysis shows how business education reproduces classed and gendered understandings of appropriate and desirable workplace personas in financial services. The analysis is based on original empirical research undertaken in London's investment banking sector comprising 90 semi-structured interviews and content analysis of business education courses offered to investment bankers. Empirically, the paper focuses attention on the comparatively neglected role of business education undertaken in the workplace in shaping the <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> in financial centers such as London. Theoretically, the analysis shows how work on the cultural capital associated with education credentials and their role in shaping workplace identities can be used to better understand the role of education in legitimating, reproducing and sustaining gendered <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> more generally...|$|R

40|$|The {{geographical}} {{strategies of}} transnational corporations have received extensive attention from economic geographers. A particularly important line of study has focused upon the diverse national institutions that create geographically heterogeneous <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Yet none <b>of</b> these studies place {{questions about how}} global firms act as ‘cultural entrepreneurs’ at the centre of their analysis. This paper, therefore, uses the case of transnational law firms to extend theoretical debates about the geographies of learning and best practice through new micro-scale consideration of the way managers in TNCs act as cultural entrepreneurs, driving change in institutionalised <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> through strategies that alter the cognitive frames of workers. Drawing primarily on data from interviews, the paper reveals how the strategies used by influential partners in transnational law firms to drive changes in <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> do not lead to forms of global strong convergence in practice but converging divergences as cultures change in subtle, often unpredicted ways. It is argued that economic geographers need {{to pay more attention}} to the mechanisms of such changes in culture, and the processes of change in national business systems more widely, so as to contribute to debates about corporate culture but also the varieties of capitalism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{promotion}} of patient safety and drug safety through {{promotion of}} pharmacist’s drug safety practice {{was among the}} most important aims of China’s health delivery system reform, but regional inequity in pharmacist’s drug safety practice was still serious in China. Methods The 2011 national patient safety and medication error baseline survey was carried {{out for the first time}} in China, and through analyzing dataset from the survey, this study was set up to test both China’s regional inequity in pharmacist’s drug safety practice and major influencing factors for pharmacist’s drug safety practice among different districts of China. Results Pharmacist’s drug safety practice in regions with higher per capita GDP and more abundant medical resources was still better than that in regions with lower per capita GDP and less abundant medical resources. In all districts of China, pharmacist’s drug safety knowledge, drug safety attitude, self-perceived pressure and fatigue, hospital management quality, and hospital regulation were major influencing factors for pharmacist’s drug safety practice, while only in regions with higher per capita GDP and more abundant medical resources, hospital drug safety culture, supervisor’s work team management, cooperation atmosphere of work team, and drug safety <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> team were major influencing factors for pharmacist’s drug safety practice. Conclusion Regional inequity in pharmacist’s drug safety practice still existed in China. In all districts of China, promoting pharmacist’s drug safety knowledge, drug safety attitude, self-perceived pressure and fatigue, hospital management quality, and hospital regulation could help promote pharmacist’s drug safety practice, while only in regions with higher per capita GDP and more abundant medical resources, promoting hospital drug safety culture, supervisor’s work team management, cooperation atmosphere of work team, and drug safety <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> team could help promote pharmacist’s drug safety practice. And in regions with lower per capita GDP and less abundant medical resources, the link between pharmacist’s drug safety practice and hospital drug safety culture/supervisor’s work team management/cooperation atmosphere of work team/drug safety <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> team should also be gradually established. </p...|$|E

40|$|Just as {{technology}} corporations in the San Francisco Bay Area use {{the rhetoric of}} progress and diversity in their hiring practices and mission statement, so have the global art museums who {{are a part of}} a history of development that displaces communities of color. Hiring practices, community involvement, and the <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> show that these initiatives affirm particular gendered racialized subjects in order to continue accruing power and capital. The artists Mail Order Brides/M. O. B. show the relationship between the creation of a <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and the sanitization of community by neoliberal corporations in the Bay Area. Their mixed- media performance series Manananggoogle uses the visual devices of camp and the grotesque to simultaneously recuperate female sexuality and transgress neoliberal capitalist structures. I focus on “Divide//Conquer,” a performance event of the series. By using the manananggal, the Filipino folkloric witch, M. O. B. shows that the true monstrosities of these corporations are the structures of oppression. As a result, M. O. B. shows that representation of artists of color in museums affirms the neoliberal structure. As a performance that utilizes visitor participation, M. O. B. calls upon the audience/participants to enact the inverted gendered lines of corporations. In doing so, the visitors perform the possibilities of a visual complex not implicated in these past and current violences...|$|E
