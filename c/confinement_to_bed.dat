For these reasons, calcitonin remains a first-line therapy in bone loss related to a hyper-resorptive state. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to microgravity results in cardiovascular deconditioning which {{is marked by}} orthostatic intolerance in the returning astronauts and recovering bed-ridden patients.

60|$|The young Boer leader, Scheepers, {{had long}} been a thorn {{in the side of}} the British. He had infested the {{southern}} districts for some months, and he had distinguished himself both by the activity of his movements and by the ruthless vigour of some of his actions. Early in October a serious illness and consequent <b>confinement</b> <b>to</b> his <b>bed</b> brought him at last within the range of British mobility. On his recovery he was tried for repeated breaches of the laws of war, including the murder of several natives. He was condemned to death, and was executed in December. Much sympathy was excited by his gallantry and his youth--he was only twenty-three. On the other hand, our word was pledged to protect the natives, and if he whose hand had been so heavy upon them escaped, all confidence would have been lost in our promises and our justice. That British vengeance was not indiscriminate was shown soon afterwards in the case of a more important commander, Kritzinger, who was the chief leader of the Boers within Cape Colony. Kritzinger was wounded and captured while endeavouring to cross the line near Hanover Road upon December 15th. He was put upon his trial, and his fate turned upon how far he was responsible for the misdeeds of some of his subordinates. It was clearly shown that he had endeavoured to hold them within the bounds of civilised warfare, and with congratulations and handshakings he was acquitted by the military court.|$|R

Polyethylene glycol 4000 was administered orally for 14 days and the dosage was adjusted according to the Bristol stool types. Demographic characteristics, disease status, treatment period and factors affecting clinical outcome, especially the concomitant medications, were recorded. ResultsAfter administration of polyethylene glycol 4000, 194 cases (96. 52 %) showed remission of constipation, including 153 (76. 12 %) persistent remission. The average defecation frequency increased significantly after treatment {{and the percentage of}} patients with stools of normal types (Bristol types 3 – 5) increased as well. Genders, ages and concomitant medications showed no significant influence on the persistent remission rate. After consecutive treatment for two weeks, patients with slight movement showed a significantly higher remission rate than those without movement (95 % vs 80 %). At the end of treatment, most accompanying symptoms were relieved obviously. Patients with a medical history of constipation or ever taking laxatives showed a lower remission rate. Sixty cases (29. 85 %) developed diarrhea during the observational period, among whom 6 (10 %) withdrew from the clinical observation voluntarily at the first onset of diarrhea. Two cases suffered from abdominal pain. ConclusionsPolyethylene glycol 4000 (Forlax®) has efficacy on functional constipation in posttraumatic bedridden patients.

40|$|Reduction of {{exercise}} capacity with <b>confinement</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> rest is well recognized. Underlying physiological mechanisms include dramatic reductions in maximal stroke volume, cardiac output, and oxygen uptake. However, bed rest by {{itself does not}} appear to contribute to cardiac dysfunction. Increased muscle fatigue is associated with reduced muscle blood flow, red cell volume, capillarization and oxidative enzymes. Loss of muscle mass and bone density may be reflected by reduced muscle strength and higher risk for injury to bones and joints. The resultant deconditioning caused by bed rest can be independent of the primary disease and physically debilitating in patients who attempt to reambulate to normal active living and working. A challenge to clinicians and health care specialists has been the identification of appropriate and effective methods to restore physical capacity of patients during or after restricted physical activity associated with prolonged bed rest. The examination of physiological responses to bed rest deconditioning and exercise training in healthy subjects has provided significant information to develop effective rehabilitation treatments. The successful application of acute exercise to enhance orthostatic stability, daily endurance exercise to maintain aerobic capacity, or specific resistance exercises to maintain musculoskeletal integrity rather than the use of surgical, pharmacological, and other medical treatments for clinical conditions has been enhanced by investigation and understanding of underlying mechanisms that distinguish physical deconditioning from the disease. This symposium presents an overview of cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning associated with reduced physical work capacity following prolonged bed rest and exercise training regimens that have proven successful in ameliorating or reversing these adverse effects...|$|E

40|$|Background: Inadequate {{nutrition}} during hospitalization {{is strongly}} associated with poor patient outcome, but ensuring adequate food intake is not a priority in clinical routine worldwide. This lack of priority results in inadequate and unbalanced food intake in patients and huge amounts of wasted food. Objectives: We evaluate the main factors {{that are associated with}} reduced meal intake in hospitalized patients and the differences between geographical regions. Design: We conducted a descriptive analysis of data from 9 consecutive, annual, and cross-sectional nutritionDay samples (2006 - 2014) in a total of 91, 245 adult patients in 6668 wards in 2584 hospitals in 56 countries. A general estimation equation methodology was used to develop a model for meal intake, and P-value thresholding was used for model selection. Results: The proportion of patients who ate a full meal varied widely (24. 7 - 61. 5 %) across world regions. The factors that were most {{strongly associated with}} reduced food intake on nutritionDay were reduced intake during the previous week (OR: 0. 20; 95 % CI: 0. 17, 0. 22), <b>confinement</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> (OR: 0. 49; 95 % CI: 0. 44, 0. 55), female sex (OR: 0. 53; 95 % CI: 0. 5, 0. 56), younger age (OR: 0. 74; 95 % CI: 0. 64, 0. 85) and older age (OR: 0. 80; 95 % CI: 0. 74; 0. 88), and low body mass index (OR: 0. 84; 95 % CI: 0. 79, 0. 90). The pattern of associated factors was homogenous across world regions. Conclusions: A set of factors that are associated with full meal intake was identified and is applicable to patients hospitalized in any region of the world. Thus, the likelihood for reduced food intake is easily estimated through access to patient characteristics, independent of world regions, and enables the easy personalization of food provision...|$|E
40|$|Maximal {{oxygen uptake}} (VO 2 max) is reduced in healthy {{individuals}} {{confined to bed}} rest, suggesting it is independent of any disease state. The magnitude of reduction in VO 2 max is dependent on duration of bed rest and the initial level of aerobic fitness (VO 2 max), but {{it appears to be}} independent of age or gender. Bed rest induces an elevated maximal heart rate which, in turn, is associated with decreased cardiac vagal tone, increased sympathetic catecholamine secretion, and greater cardiac beta-receptor sensitivity. Despite the elevation in heart rate, VO 2 max is reduced primarily from decreased maximal stroke volume and cardiac output. An elevated ejection fraction during exercise following bed rest suggests that the lower stroke volume is not caused by ventricular dysfunction but is primarily the result of decreased venous return associated with lower circulating blood volume, reduced central venous pressure, and higher venous compliance in the lower extremities. VO 2 max, stroke volume, and cardiac output are further compromised by exercise in the upright posture. The contribution of hypovolemia to reduced cardiac output during exercise following bed rest is supported by the close relationship between the relative magnitude (% delta) and time course of change in blood volume and VO 2 max during bed rest, and also by the fact that retention of plasma volume is associated with maintenance of VO 2 max after bed rest. Arteriovenous oxygen difference during maximal exercise is not altered by bed rest, suggesting that peripheral mechanisms may not contribute significantly to the decreased VO 2 max. However reduction in baseline and maximal muscle blood flow, red blood cell volume, and capillarization in working muscles represent peripheral mechanisms that may contribute to limited oxygen delivery and, subsequently, lowered VO 2 max. Thus, alterations in cardiac and vascular functions induced by prolonged <b>confinement</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> rest contribute to diminution of maximal oxygen uptake and reserve capacity to perform physical work...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions {{are prone}} to {{reactivation}} and recurrence in response to various local or systemic triggering factors. OBJECTIVE: To study the characteristics of five bedridden geriatric patients who presented with herpetic recurrences on the buttocks, gluteal cleft, and perianal region during hospitalization. METHODS: Data were gathered regarding age, gender, reason for hospitalization, localization of lesions, clinical presentation, previous clinical diagnosis and topical treatments, immune status and immunosuppressant drug intake, as well as prior history of labial or genital herpes. A skin biopsy was taken for histologic examination and immunohistochemical viral identification. Viral culture and viral serology were performed and data regarding antiviral therapy were recorded. RESULTS: The five patients (three women, two men) were aged > 80 years and hospitalized for either severe drug-induced renal insufficiency (one case), severe pneumonia (two cases), or stroke causing restricted mobility (two cases). Numerous well demarcated, painful ulcerations developed in the perianal region of these patients, and one patient also presented with some vesicular lesions. The lesions had been confused with mycotic and/or bacterial infections for 10 - 14 days. No inguinal lymphadenopathies were present {{and there was no}} fever. None of the patients had a previous history of recurrent labial or genital HSV infections or HIV infection. Histology was suggestive of HSV infection in two of five patients. Immunohistochemistry identified HSV type I (three patients) and HSV type II (two patients) infections. Viral culture with immunofluorescence viral identification revealed HSV type I in one of the four patients in whom a swab for viral culture was taken. Serology revealed past HSV infection. All lesions cured gradually after 10 - 14 days of intravenous acyclovir (aciclovir) treatment. CONCLUSION: Herpetic lesions of the perineal region represent a rare complication in bedridden geriatric patients {{in the absence of a}} previous history of HSV infections at the same site. Common traits of patients with this condition were the presence of numerous ulcerated lesions, prolonged time course, and <b>confinement</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> The latter probably modifies the skin condition, which triggers viral reactivation and favors cutaneous extension of the infection. Complementary diagnostic methods for viral detection and identification are mandatory. Peer reviewe...|$|E
