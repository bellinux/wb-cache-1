40|$|A {{qualitative}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the perceptions of preservice teachers on how <b>computers</b> <b>will</b> be used in schools in the future. Undergraduate students (n= 40) were given a 60 -minute multimedia presentation on how computer and multimedia technologies are used in schools, followed by group discussions on the ways in which <b>computers</b> <b>will</b> be used in schools in 10 years, and an assigned one-page essay addressing the topic. The study revealed that preservice teachers have high expectations for using computers in their classrooms, some of which are unrealistic for the next 10 years. Many students felt that assignments and materials will be accessed via electronic mail or the Internet (n= 37); software will be personalized, self-paced, and written by students (n= 32); virtual reality, CD-ROMs, and holograms will be commonplace (n= 31); and <b>computers</b> <b>will</b> be voice-activated and have touch-screens (n= 30).

This can be very beneficial to the diver, but if the dive computer fails the diver can no longer monitor his or her gas reserves. Most divers using a gas-integrated <b>computer</b> <b>will</b> also have a standard air pressure gauge. The computer is either connected to the first stage by a high pressure hose, or has two parts - the pressure transducer on the first stage and the display at the wrist or console, which communicate by wireless data transmission link; the signals are encoded to eliminate the risk of one diver's computer picking up a signal from another diver's transducer or radio interference from other sources.|$|E
25|$|Computers {{can perform}} both {{sequential}} control and feedback control, and typically a single <b>computer</b> <b>will</b> do both {{in an industrial}} application. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are a type of special purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in relay logic type systems. General purpose process control computers have increasingly replaced stand alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. Process control computers can process data from a network of PLCs, instruments and controllers in order to implement typical (such as PID) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control algorithms using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers and management.|$|E

[...] In the English press, the album garnered favourable reviews in NME, Melody Maker, The Guardian, and Q. Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that [...] "Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years time I'm betting OK <b>Computer</b> <b>will</b> be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era."
