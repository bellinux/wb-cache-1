40|$|The coolant outlet {{temperature}} for the Modular Helium Reactor (MHR) was increased {{to improve the}} overall efficiency of nuclear hydrogen production using either thermochemical or high temperature electrolysis (HTE) processes. The inlet temperature was also increased to keep about the same _T across the reactor core. Thermal hydraulic analyses of the current MHR design were performed with these updated temperatures to determine {{the impact of these}} highter temperatures on pressure drops, coolant flow rates and temperature profiles within the vessel and core regions. Due to these increased operating temperatures, the overall efficiency of hydrogen production processes increases but the steady state reactor vessel temperature is found to be well above the ASME code limits for current vessel materials.

40|$|The cooling {{performance}} of the stack radiator of a fuel cell electric vehicle was evaluated under various actual road driving conditions, such as highway and uphill travel. The thermal stability was then optimized, thereby ensuring stable operation of the stack thermal management system. The <b>coolant</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature of the radiator in the highway mode was lower than that associated with the uphill mode because the corresponding frontal air velocity was higher than obtained in the uphill mode. In both the highway and uphill modes, the coolant temperatures of the radiator, operated under actual road driving conditions, were lower than the allowable limit (80 °C); this is the maximum temperature at which stable operation of the stack thermal management system of the fuel cell electric vehicle could be maintained. Furthermore, under actual road driving conditions in uphill mode, the initial temperature difference (ITD) between the coolant temperature and air temperature of the system was higher than that associated with the highway mode; this higher ITD occurred even though the thermal load of the system in uphill mode was greater than that corresponding to the highway mode. Since the <b>coolant</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature is expected to exceed the allowable limit (80 °C) in uphill mode under higher ambient temperature with air conditioning system operation, the FEM design layout should be modified to improve the heat capacity.

40|$|Abstract: Temperature (thermal) cycling is a {{major cause}} of {{failures}} of electronic systems. This paper discusses the effect of the steady-state operating temperature, as controlled by parameters such as the <b>coolant</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature, on the fatigue life of electronic assemblies subjected to thermal cycling resulting from off-on power cycling. The power cycling fatigue life depends on the steady-state operating temperature Ts, {{as well as on the}} temperature range ΔT in the thermal cycle. The power cycling durability of copper plated through holes in circuit boards is very sensitive to the steady-state PTH operating temperature, because the strain ranges are in the portion of the copper S-Nf (strain vs. number of cycles to failure) curve that is nearly horizontal. If the power is turned on at the same time the coolant flow is started, reducing the steady-state operating temperature can improve the durability. If the coolant is turned on for a substantial period before the power is turned on, reducing the <b>coolant</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature may degrade the durability for operation on hot days...|$|E

40|$|A {{steam line}} break {{accident}} {{is one of}} the possible severe abnormal transients in a pressurized water reactor. It is required to present an analysis of a steam line break accident in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) of a nuclear power reactor. Only simple one-dimensional core simulations are currently applied to such accident analysis. However, the asymmetric characteristics of a steam break accident may require more detailed local information {{in order to determine the}} potential fuel damage resulting from the transient. TITAN, a coupled (neutronics and thermal-hydraulics) code with state-of-the-art neutronics and thermal-hydraulics models, is therefore modified and applied to steam line break accident simulations. The capabilities that are added to the code for a steam line break analysis include multiregion core inlet temperature forcing function, total <b>inlet</b> <b>coolant</b> flow rate boundary condition, total <b>inlet</b> <b>coolant</b> flow rate transient simulation capability, boron tracking equations, flow/coolant temperature transient plus control rod transient option, and one-dimensional, fully implicit numerical scheme. for thermal-hydraulics calculations. The modifications to TITAN are tested with a ten-channel PWR model. For <b>inlet</b> <b>coolant</b> temperature transients (one of the transients involved in a steam line break accident) test calculations lead to the conclusion that there is no significant difference between the results of closed- and open-channel calculations until boiling occurs. A ten-channel model with two partially inserted control rods is employed for the transient simulations. Steady state conditions are obtained first by both open- and closed-channel calculations. Results show that cross flow between channels is insignificant. Thus, the onedimensional, fully implicit numerical scheme for the thermal-hydraulics equations is useful to speed up the calculations. More than half of the computational effort is saved by using this scheme compared to the semi-implicit numerical scheme. Two extreme situations relevant to a steam line break accident are investigated: (1) Significant boiling due to severe depressurization when no return to power exists. (2) Return to power with no boiling because of high coolant temperature feedback coefficients. It is concluded that even after boiling occurs, the global parameters, such as total power and assembly power, still show no significant difference between the closed- and open-channel calcualtions. However, the local parameters, such as nodal power, void fraction and MDNBR, reveal differences between the two calculations. Results show that the open-channel calculation predicts lower MDNBR values as compared with the results of closed-channel calculation in a vapor generation process, since the coolant is driven away from of the hot spots. On the other hand, during a vapor condensation process, closed-channel calculations predict lower MDNBR results, since no cross flow is allowed to accelerated the condensation process. A closed-channel, uniform <b>inlet</b> <b>coolant</b> temperature transient calculation is performed. The results verify the necessity for a three-dimensional calculation of the accident simulations, since no boiling was predicted by-the one-dimensional calculation throughout the simulation period...|$|R
