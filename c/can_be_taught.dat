5|$|In {{addition}} to entertainment and artistic merit, LARP events may be designed for educational or political purposes. For example, the Danish secondary school Østerskov Efterskole uses LARP to teach {{most of its}} classes. Language classes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> by immersing students in a role-playing scenario {{in which they are}} forced to improvise speech or writing in the language they are learning. Politically themed LARP events may attempt to awaken or shape political thinking within a culture.|$|E
5|$|Human anatomy, {{physiology}} and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical {{students in their}} first year at medical school. Human anatomy <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods. A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology.|$|E
5|$|The intelligence, domesticability and {{versatility}} of {{the elephant}} gave it considerable advantages over other wild {{animals such as}} lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners {{in a variety of}} ways, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.|$|E

5|$|There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, {{both teams}} must send out three Pokémon {{in a row}} at once; Pokémon on {{the left or right}} side can only attack the opponent's Pokémon on the same side or in the center. Changing {{position}} takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pokémon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pokémon <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> one of three moves, and using them together in Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pokémon rather than only Single Battles as usual.|$|E

GCED <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> from a critical and transformative perspective, whereby students are thinking, feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally transformative. Teachers provide social issues in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, and do something about.|$|E

25|$|Elementary {{set theory}} {{can be studied}} informally and {{intuitive}}ly, and so <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> in primary schools using Venn diagrams. The intuitive approach tacitly assumes that a set may be formed from the class of all objects satisfying any particular defining condition. This assumption gives rise to paradoxes, the simplest and best known of which are Russell's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox. Axiomatic set theory was originally devised to rid set theory of such paradoxes.|$|E
25|$|Specially bred rats {{have been}} kept as pets {{at least since the}} late 19th century. Pet rats are {{typically}} variants of the species brown rat, but black rats and giant pouched rats are also known to be kept. Pet rats behave differently from their wild counterparts depending on how many generations they {{have been kept}} as pets. Pet rats do not pose any more of a health risk than pets such as cats or dogs. Tamed rats are generally friendly and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> to perform selected behaviors.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, but {{especially}} London, during the 1970s and the 1980s {{the teaching and}} playing of cricket was dying in schools funded by the state, for many complex reasons and by 1990 only 20 {{out of more than}} 800 such schools in London were playing the game. The teaching of cricket has declined throughout England in recent years, but the issue is compounded in London as there are few local teams with their own grounds on which children <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught.</b> To counter this lack of interest, CKC was set up by two Yorkshiremen William Greaves and Hayden Turner, who have a passion for cricket, and were concerned at its decline.|$|E

25|$|One such {{dialogue}} of Plato's that utilized the Socratic Method was the Meno. The participants were Socrates, Meno, Anytus, {{and one of}} Meno's slave boys. The dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates whether virtue <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught.</b> Socrates responds by stating {{that he does not}} know the definition of virtue. Meno replies by stating the characteristics of a virtuous man, to which Socrates responds that the characteristics of a virtuous man may be the by-products of virtuousness but they by no means define virtue. Meno is obliged to agree; to wit, he tries to modify his explanation of virtue. Socrates counters each attempt by pointing to inconsistencies and circular arguments.|$|E
25|$|Amusia has {{recently}} been classified as a learning disability that affects musical abilities. Research suggests that in congenital amusia, younger subjects <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> tone differentiation techniques. This finding leads researchers to believe that amusia is related to dyslexia and other similar disorders. Research {{has been shown that}} amusia may be related to an increase in size of the cerebral cortex, which may be a result of a malformation in cortical development. Diseases such as dyslexia and epilepsy are due to a malformation in cortical development and also lead to an increase in cortical thickness, which leads researchers to believe that congenital amusia may be caused by the identical phenomenon in a different area of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Baxter {{is a new}} robot {{introduced}} in 2012 which learns by guidance. A worker could teach Baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having Baxter memorize them. Extra dials, buttons, and controls are available on Baxter's arm for more precision and features. Any regular worker could program Baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes, unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding {{in order to be}} used. This means Baxter needs no programming in order to operate. No software engineers are needed. This also means Baxter <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> to perform multiple, more complicated tasks. Sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller, more precise tasks.|$|E

25|$|The fox trot is {{most often}} {{associated}} with the Missouri Fox Trotter breed, but is also seen in other breeds. The fox trot is a four-beat broken diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind, eliminating the moment of suspension and giving a smooth ride said to also be sure-footed. The gait is sometimes described as having the horse walk with the front feet and trot with the back. In a fox trot, the horse must keep one front foot {{on the ground at}} all times and display a sliding motion with the hind legs. Other gaited breeds are able to perform the fox trot and {{it is one of the}} only ambling gaits that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> to horses that are not naturally gaited. The gait creates an optical illusion that a horse is walking in front and trotting behind.|$|E

25|$|A study {{dedicated}} to investigating the thin ideal internalization {{as a factor}} of bulimia nervosa is Thompson's and Stice's research. The aim of their {{study was to investigate}} how and to what degree does media affect the thin ideal internalization. Thompson and Stice used randomized experiments (more specifically programs) {{dedicated to}} teaching young women how to be more critical when it comes to media, in order to reduce thin ideal internalization. The results showed that by creating more awareness of the media's control of the societal ideal of attractiveness, the thin ideal internalization significantly dropped. In other words, less thin ideal images portrayed by the media resulted in less thin ideal internalization. Therefore, Thompson and Stice concluded that media affected greatly the thin ideal internalization. Papies showed {{that it is not the}} thin ideal itself, but rather the self-association with other persons of a certain weight that decide how someone with bulimia nervosa feels. People that associate themselves with thin models get in a positive attitude when they see thin models and people that associate with overweight get in a negative attitude when they see thin models. Moreover, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> to associate with thinner people.|$|E
