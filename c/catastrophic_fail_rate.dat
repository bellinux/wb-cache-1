In the past, the computing speed of such systems has been constantly improved. However, for various technological reasons this trends is expected to stop, and alternative ways of computing are under investigation. The computational power of chemical systems has been investigated for quite some time. However, {{it is not clear}} what the computing capacity of such systems is. It has been studied how to construct a Turing complete chemical computer in the well-mixed chemical reactor setup. Liekens and Fernando (“Turing complete catalytic computers”, in: Advances in Artificial life, Springer, 2007, pp. 1202 - 1211) have suggested a systematic way to investigate the chemical completeness issue. Their main finding was that chemical {{computers are}} Turing complete in principle. However, spontaneous errors in computation can occur.

40|$|Semiconductor {{manufacturing}} companies aim to achieve shortest test times for products {{while maintaining the}} product quality. Achieving shortest test times for devices requires multiple updates to the test flow and test content. Test cost varies {{in direct proportion to}} production test time required to test chips and detect fails. This thesis presents a method to achieve shortest test times by determining when the updates are needed and what are the changes to the test flow and test content. This thesis introduces a new Adaptive Test Scheme (ATS). ATS estimates individual test <b>fail</b> <b>rates</b> dynamically, per die, and makes real-time modifications to test order and test contents. ATS computes data-driven test <b>fail</b> <b>rate</b> estimates and uses the estimates to identify the required changes and trigger updates to test flow and test content. ATS uses Bayesian statistics to model the per test <b>fail</b> <b>rates</b> and update the test orders. ATS achieves test time reductions by employing per wafer elimination. ATS also incorporates a simple quality monitor, by resetting the test content at the start of next wafer. This thesis evaluates the performance of ATS with synthetic data generated by a Monte Carlo method and with production wafer sort data for two manufactured products. The product data results show ATS reduced by 20 % the total test-time for one product and by 40 % for a second product, with changes in product quality level below industry targets...|$|R

A transversal competence is one which can be re-used when shifting to another context. Our goal is to contribute to improve Computer Science 1 (CS 1) course’s results by the systematic incorporation of activities based on transversal competencies. We designed a set of activities to enhance the development of transversal competencies, specially planning and time management, team work and communication skills. Hypothetically, we propose that including this kind of activities helps to obtain better results in the course. An initial experimentation was done in 2010.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{multitude}} of factors contributing to high <b>fail</b> <b>rates</b> among students studying first year engineering Mechanics, where <b>fail</b> <b>rates</b> {{in the order of}} 20 - 40 % are common and persist across cohorts. Previous studies in the field of engineering Mechanics education have tended to focus on particular issues in the teaching and learning experience, or learning specific topic areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a more holistic understanding of first year engineering Mechanics education than has been conducted to date. The research examined learning and teaching in first year engineering Mechanics courses at the University of Wollongong, The University of Tasmania, the University of Technology, Sydney, and the Australian Maritime College at UTAS. Multiple research methods were used to explore teaching and learning in Mechanics, separated into five lines of investigation. These lines of investigation were informed by five research subquestions: • What are students expected to learn in first year engineering Mechanics? • What are the key topic areas students have difficulty with? • What is the relationship between students’ academic history and their achievement in Mechanics? • What are the views of students and academics on first year engineering Mechanics education? • How do students engage with new and different options for learning Mechanics? Each of these lines of investigation offered different perspectives on the issue of high <b>fail</b> <b>rates</b> in Mechanics. The research was underpinned by Biggs’ 3 P (Presage, Process, Product) model of teaching and learning. The 3 P model provided a framework for identifying possible relationships between the various issues identified in each of the five areas of investigation. Research findings were mapped to the 3 P model to create a holistic understanding of the many factors contributing to high <b>fail</b> <b>rates</b> in first year Mechanics courses. Mapping of research findings to the 3 P model identified significant weaknesses in engineering Mechanics education in terms of its ability to support a wide array of student learning needs, and in the management of students and educators expectations of the teaching and learning process. This mapping process also identified a number of limitations in the 3 P model itself. This thesis proposes a revised 3 P model that takes into account the complexities and contextual influences that are evident in Mechanics education. The revised 3 P-student responsive model, abbreviated to 3 P-sr, provides a framework for designing engineering Mechanics education that is based on evidence drawn directly from Mechanics education. The 3 P-sr model creates a clearer representation of the influences and possible interactions between student and teacher-controlled aspects of the educational process. It emphasises the cyclic nature of teaching and learning in Mechanics, and reflects the need for a more purposeful and flexible interaction between student and teacher. The model provides a guide for the future development of engineering Mechanics courses that are more flexible, and responsive to the wide ranging learning needs of students studying Mechanics that were identified in this research. Whilst the 3 P-sr model is not tested in this research, its development from the wide range of evidence presented in this mixedmethods research represents a novel contribution to addressing the problem of high <b>fail</b> <b>rates</b> in engineering Mechanics courses...|$|R
30|$|Of {{the four}} methods scaled up in stage 2, gDNA {{extracted}} by N 96 gave {{the best results}} with no inconsistent genotypes, 6.5 % of loci showing significant departure from HWE and an overall <b>fail</b> <b>rate</b> of 8.3 %. The N 96 method has also performed well in other plant species and genotyping systems (Llongueras, et al., 2012). Comparable <b>fail</b> <b>rates</b> were also achieved with methods CQ and SQ, but the percentage of assays departing from HWE was nearly doubled. Method D showed the highest proportion of missing genotypes, and tended to give the lowest DNA yields of the four methods trialled in stage 2. These results demonstrate that improvements {{in the quality of}} gDNA extracted using the standard method (S) could be achieved with additional purification (e.g. CQ). A similar version of method CQ was recently used to extract P. radiata gDNA samples which were successfully genotyped using both the iPLEX® Gold MassARRAY® and an alternative high-throughput platform, the GoldenGate universal bead arrays (Illumina San Diego, CA, USA) (Dillon, et al., 2010). Taking into account assay performance, cost, and ease of use, method N 96 has been chosen as our method of choice for future genotyping studies.|$|R

40|$|Background: In the European Union the placing of {{pesticides}} {{on the market}} requires as a prerequisite that a risk assessment demonstrates low risks to {{human health and the}} environment, among which includes pollinators. Currently risks are evaluated for honey bees and for non-target arthropods (NTA) of cultivated ecosystems. The actual protection of pollinators other than the honey bees, as for example for non-Apis bees, in relation to these risk assessments has recently been questioned and requires further investigation. We present the findings from a comparison of Hazard Quotient (HQ) value calculations to assess the risk to honey bees, non-target arthropods and to non-Apis bees (with the application of an additional safety factor of 10). Calculations were based on publicly available ecotoxicological data. Results: The risk to NTA, honey bees and non-Apis bees, as depicted by HQ values, indicated a higher <b>fail</b> <b>rate</b> for NTA than for bees, but a similar pass / <b>fail</b> <b>rate</b> for non-Apis bees when compared to the NTA scheme.

40|$|Conventional {{threading}} operations involve {{two distinct}} machining processes: drilling and threading. Therefore, {{it is time}} consuming for the tools must be changed and the workpiece has to be moved to another machine. This paper presents {{an analysis of the}} combined process (drilling followed by threading) using a single tool for both operations: the tap-milling tool. Before presenting the methodology used to evaluate this hybrid tool, the ODS (operating deflection shapes) basics is shortly described. ODS and finite element modeling (FEM) were used during this research to optimize the process aiming to achieve higher stable machining conditions and increasing the tool life. Both methods allowed the determination of the natural frequencies and displacements of the machining center and optimize the workpiece fixture system. The results showed that there is an excellent correlation between the dynamic stability of the machining center-tool holder and the tool life, avoiding a tool premature catastrophic failure. Nevertheless, evidence showed that the tool is very sensitive to work conditions. Undoubtedly, the use of ODS and FEM eliminate empiric decisions concerning the optimization of machining conditions and increase drastically the tool life. After the ODS and FEM studies, it was possible to optimize the process and work material fixture system and machine more than 30, 000 threaded holes without reaching the tool life limit and <b>catastrophic</b> <b>fail...</b>|$|R
