40|$|In {{the master}} thesis, which {{discusses}} the suitability analysis and possible utilization of valuation methods of environmental goods, the contingent valuation method {{is used on}} {{the example of the}} groundwater quality valuation in Krško polje. This method was valuated as the most suitable for groundwater quality valuation as it is flexible enough {{and at the same time}} enables the valuation of both used and non-used values. The result of the research is monetary valuation of improving the quality of groundwater, which is valuated on the basis of “willingness to pay” for the <b>programmes</b> of <b>measures</b> for two scenarios, which provide variously ambitious measures of improving the quality of groundwater, acquired from the survey among the inhabitants. On the basis of statistical analysis it was proven that “willingness to pay” is above all the factor of interest, location and income of inhabitants, and trust in the <b>programmes</b> of <b>measures.</b> The valuated benefits of quality were considered in the framework cost benefit analysis, on the basis of which establishment of less stringent environmental objectives for achieving good water status may be grounded. In the case of <b>programme</b> of <b>measures,</b> which goal is to reach the nitrate concentration value in groundwater below the limit value of 50 mg per l, which is the minimum requirement for drinking water (in accordance to the Rules on Drinking Water), the determination of the exemptions to the environmental objectives, according to the presumption that the costs are disproportionately high when they exceed anticipated benefits twice, is not grounded. Regarding two more ambitious <b>programmes</b> of <b>measures,</b> which provide measures to reduce the concentration of nitrates in groundwater to 22, 5 g per ml and 10 g per ml, the distinctive disproportion between costs required to achieve the objective set and anticipated benefits, was found in the cost benefit analysis.

Transfer time of diffuse pollutants from soils to aquifer may be quite long (several years), an early detection of groundwater quality decrease is therefore {{necessary in order to}} set up protection measures in due time.
