25|$|The current electoral scene {{could be}} the end of the bipartite scheme as the anti-Sandinista forces split into two major {{political}} alliances: the Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance (ALN) and the <b>Constitutionalist</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party</b> (PLC). The Sandinista forces are also running divided, as the dissident Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) is pulling a significant amount of the moderated Sandinista and independent votes.|$|E

25|$|The FSLN {{remains one}} of Nicaragua's two leading parties. The FSLN often polls in {{opposition}} to the <b>Constitutionalist</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party,</b> or PLC. In the 2006 Nicaraguan general election, former FSLN President Daniel Ortega was re-elected President of Nicaragua with 38.7% of the vote compared to 29% for his leading rival, bringing in the country's second Sandinista government after 16 years of the opposition winning elections. Ortega and the FSLN were re-elected again in the presidential elections of November 2011 and of November 2016.|$|E
25|$|The FSLN {{also won}} 38 {{seats in the}} congressional elections, {{becoming}} the party with the largest representation in parliament. The split in the <b>Constitutionalist</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party</b> helped to allow the FSLN to become the largest party in Congress, however the Sandinista vote had a minuscule split between the FSLN and MRS, and the liberal party combined {{is larger than the}} Frente Faction. In 2010, several liberal congressmen raised accusations about the FSLN presumably attempting to buy votes in order to pass constitutional reforms that would allow Ortega to run for office for the 6th time since 1984. In 2011, Ortega was re-elected as President.|$|E

Alemán defeated Ortega with 51% of the vote, and Alemán and Bolaños were sworn in as president and vice president, respectively, on January 10, 1997.

50|$|Enrique Bolaños {{was born}} in Masaya on May 13, 1928 to Nicolás Bolaños Cortés (1890-1963) and wife Amanda del Rosario Geyer Abaunza, and {{paternal}} grandson of Alejandro Bolaños Cuadra (1858-1914) and wife and cousin Cándida Cortés Bolaños (1854-1918). His father, a wealthy businessman, was poisoned by an employee. He was also a maternal relative of Justo Abaunza, 25th and 27th President of Nicaragua. The Bolaños family has played a minor role in Nicaraguan politics, traditionally associated with the deep-rooted <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party</b> that brought Somoza dynasty to power in 1939. Bolaños, however, carefully aligned himself with the anti-Somoza <b>Liberal</b> <b>Constitutionalist</b> <b>Party</b> founded by Ramiro Sacasa Guerrero in 1968. The Bolaños family has usually maintained a hands-off approach to Nicaraguan politics, focusing rather on business endeavors.|$|R

These results hint at a continuing and still fluid change in the correlation of political forces in the country.|$|R
