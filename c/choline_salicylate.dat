40|$|We report here a {{combined}} experimental and theoretical {{study on the}} bio-compatible <b>salicylate</b> <b>choline</b> ionic liquid. The liquid structure has been investigated by X-ray diffraction and vibrational (IR and Raman) spectroscopy. Local structure has been obtained from ab initio calculations on static ion pairs and from dynamic simulations of {{a small portion of}} the liquid. The theoretical models indicate that salicylate is connected by hydrogen bonding to choline mainly through the carboxylate group and forms stable ion pairs. A strong intramolecular interaction hinders internal rotations of the OH group of salicylate and competes with the hydrogen bonding with choline. When the liquid has been simulated by classical force fields we found a good agreement with the X-ray experimental features, comparable to that obtained from AIMD simulations. Important insights on hydrogen bonding between carboxylate and choline have been also derived from the analysis of the CO stretching modes of carboxylate measured in the Raman and IR spectra and calculated from VDOS-Wannier centers procedures. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|Claims that twice-daily dosage of choline {{magnesium}} trisalicylate (CMT) may alter salicylate disposal kinetics {{and result}} in sustained plasma levels were examined. Plasma levels, urine excretion and pharmacokinetics of salicylate were estimated in six men following the recommended twice-daily dose of CMT and a smaller dose of soluble aspirin. The plasma salicylate levels achieved with CMT were lower than those seen in previous studies but this probably reflected differences of methodology. Salicylate levels were not sustained between doses and elimination rates and half-life were similar for both preparations. No major alteration of disposal kinetics could be demonstrated for CMT with the dose {{used in the present}} study. KEY WORDS: Choline magnesium trisalicylate, Aspirin, Disposal kinetics. THERE now exists a very wide range of anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of rheumatic diseases. Few are more effective than aspirin which remains the yardstick by which new drugs are still judged. Many new preparations are better tolerated than salicylates and some have prolonged half-lives which allow once- or twice-daily dosage. This latter feature has obvious advantages for patients and is likely to improve compliance. A relatively new <b>salicylate,</b> <b>choline</b> magnesium trisalicylate (CMT), is also said to provide sustained anti-inflammatory plasma levels when prescribed twice daily (1). This character-istic has not been claimed for other salicylate preparations and, therefore, warrants substantiation. One or more of the metabolic pathways by which salicylate is metabolized are capable of saturation (2). It has been suggested that this saturable effect is evident with the recommended dose of CMT, thus slowing elimination and leading to prolonged presence of salicylate in the blood (1). We have compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of CMT and a smaller dose of soluble aspirin, each being given twice daily. It was our intention to determine whether CMT metabolism differed fundamentally from soluble aspirin and whether, at the dose commonly used, CMT was associated with significant alteration of salicylate disposal kinetics...|$|R

5000|$|In {{cases where}} the infant is in obvious pain, some doctors {{recommend}} the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or child-safe pain-relief treatments containing benzocaine, lidocaine, or <b>choline</b> <b>salicylate.</b> Benzocaine must be used cautiously because it can cause methemoglobinemia; <b>choline</b> <b>salicylate</b> is related to aspirin and [...] "may cause Reye's syndrome in susceptible children, especially those with or recovering from viral infections, or when used {{in combination with other}} NSAIDs". 5% lidocaine gel produces anaesthesia (numbing) within 2-5 minutes, lasting for 10-20 minutes. However, one author concludes that, [...] "Overall, the risks and adverse effects from inappropriate or prolonged use of pharmacological agents outweigh their potential benefits." [...] She points out that [...] "the psychological trauma involved in administering medications or applying topical preparations to infants must be considered", and argues that [...] "the placebo effect must not be overlooked. For example, applying a gel of 20% benzocaine in polyethylene glycol may give only a modest benefit over applying the placebo, which gives an efficacy of 60% compared with 90% for the active preparation." ...|$|E

40|$|The ongoing {{control of}} virulent {{bacteria}} strains {{is a challenge}} for today’s medicine. An example of this, is one widely used drug employed in treating less serious external oral and ocular bacterial infections. This is a gel containing both cetalkonium chloride and <b>choline</b> <b>salicylate.</b> However, whether {{in the era of}} expanding bacterial resistance this gel is still effective, is not clear. Hence, in our work, its antibacterial effect was studied against 13 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 strains of Staphylococcus spp. and 6 strains of Streptococcus spp. drawn from the collection of the Department of Microbiology, Virology and Immunology, Kazakh National Medical University, as well as against 30 strains of Staphylococcus spp. recently isolated from Kazakh medical students. This work demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was insensitive to this preparation in all samples, while the sensitivity of Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. was almost halved, compared to untreated samples. An interesting discovery was the greater resistance of strains obtained from student volunteers than from the collection. However, despite the evident resistance of some strains to the combined cetalkonium chloride and <b>choline</b> <b>salicylate</b> gel, we put forward that it can still be used in less serious external bacterial infections...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{our study}} was to examine the {{irritation}} potential of new eye drops containing 2 % <b>choline</b> <b>salicylate</b> (CS) as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and various polymers increasing eye drop viscosity (hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone). The standard method for assessing the potential of irritating substances has been the Draize rabbit eye test. However the European Centre for Validation of Alternative Methods and the Coordinating Committee for Validation of Alternative Methods recommend, short time exposure (STE) in vitro tests as an alternative method for assessing eye irritation. The eye irritation potential was determined using cytotoxicity test methods for rabbit corneal cell line (SIRC) after 5 min exposure. The viability of cells was determined using two cytotoxicity assays: MTT and Neutral Red Uptake. According to the irritation rankings for the short time exposure test, all tested eye drops are classified as non-irritating (cell viability > 70 %) ...|$|E
