40|$|The {{extent to}} which cities can develop and market a brand has become a key {{strategy}} for maintaining competitiveness in the post-industrial economy in attracting tourism, investment, and job and population growth. In this context, ethnic populations in many Western cities have operationalized notions of culture in order to transform or reappropriate urban places, and improve the local quality of life. However, as cities become increasingly ethnically and culturally diverse, rather than a singular cultural identity occupying one neighborhood {{it is likely that}} multiple ethnic communities overlap in shared urban spaces. This dissertation offers an in-depth study of a highly diverse area of Los Angeles in order to examine the ways in which multi-ethnic communities operationalize culture, negotiate boundaries, and define their community and neighborhood. In doing so, it scrutinizes strategies of <b>cultural</b> urban <b>revitalization</b> that rely on static and singular notions of a spatial identity, and argues that planning scholars and community development practitioners support the cultural spaces of everyday life for which residents feel a strong sense of place attachment...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 149 - 165) The Kumeyaay Indians (also 'Iipay [...] Tiipay, Ipai [...] Tipai, or Diegue??o in the United States, or Kumiai in Mexico) have {{inhabited the}} landscapes of northern Baja California, Mexico, and southern California since long before European contact, originally {{making a living}} as mobile hunting, gathering, and fishing peoples in the region's varied environments. The division of Kumeyaay territory in 1848 by two distinct nation states imposed on the region an international boundary as well as separate political and economic structures, cultures, and languages. Historical processes have reduced Kumeyaay territory and population, and transformed indigenous lifeways, yet a few elder Kumeyaay still speak their native language and maintain cultural knowledge of the environment. In this thesis, I explore the questions of how contemporary ethnobotanical knowledge of Baja California's Kumeyaay Indians can make new contributions to scientific research of diachronic human-plant interactions in the study area, and how this knowledge can inform Kumeyaay <b>cultural</b> and linguistic <b>revitalization</b> through its incorporation in interpretive exhibits. I synthesize information from interviews conducted with 16 Kumeyaay plant specialists, documenting Kumeyaay knowledge of traditional uses for 47 native plants as food, medicine, tools, construction materials, and ritual resources, covering indigenous nomenclature, plant scheduling, harvesting, processing, and consumption, as well as cultural meanings associated with plants. I review archaeological, historical, ethnographic, linguistic, and botanical literature to situate the Kumeyaay ethnobotanical data in a regional and diachronic context. I discuss how this study contributes new information on the Kumeyaay and their interactions with the vegetative environment, and provide examples of how I have applied this information to support efforts toward Kumeyaay <b>cultural</b> and linguistic <b>revitalization...</b>|$|R

40|$|Historically, under resourced {{and poor}} {{performing}} school districts hampered policy efforts to revitalize urban working class neighborhoods. The housing market works {{in tandem with}} the education “market,” with schools influencing and being influenced by their surrounding neighborhoods. This study analyzes the possible link between gentrification, or the rehabilitation of working class neighborhoods, and the rise of charter school schools. Charter schools, publically funded but privately operated, are growing exponentially under current local and national school reform policies and provide alternatives to traditional neighborhood schools. Through content analysis of newspaper articles and case studies on two New York City charter schools and their neighborhoods, this study gains perspective on the relationship between charter school creation and the changing socio-economic and cultural demographics of a neighborhood. While the media analysis suggests that the perceived link is not widespread or heavily reported, the case studies indicate that some community members perceive that the charter school is related to the ongoing gentrification of the neighborhood. Those who perceive the link are divided- while many view the charter school as increasing the racial and cultural divide in the gentrified community, others view an emerging charter school as a sign for urban <b>cultural,</b> economic <b>revitalization</b> and increased opportunities for historically underserved communities.
