5|$|Cytotoxic drugs {{inhibit the}} immune {{response}} by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected, which causes toxic side effects. Immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} <b>cyclosporin</b> prevent T cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin is the INN and British Approved Name (BAN) while {{cyclosporine}} is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and <b>cyclosporin</b> is {{a former}} BAN.|$|E
25|$|The use of many {{immunosuppressive}} medications {{increases the}} risk of skin cancer. <b>Cyclosporin</b> A, a calcineurin inhibitor for example {{increases the risk}} approximately 200 times, and azathioprine about 60 times.|$|E
25|$|Kidney {{transplant}} {{recipients are}} discouraged from consuming grapefruit, pomegranate and green tea products. These food products {{are known to}} interact with the transplant medications, specifically tacrolimus, <b>cyclosporin</b> and sirolimus; the blood levels of these drugs may be increased, potentially leading to an overdose.|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin, also spelled {{cyclosporine}} and <b>cyclosporin,</b> is an immunosuppressant {{medication and}} natural product. It {{is used by}} mouth and injection into a vein for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, nephrotic syndrome, and in organ transplants to prevent rejection. It is also used as eye drops for keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes).|$|E
25|$|Ciclosporin {{is highly}} metabolized in {{humans and animals}} after ingestion. The {{resulting}} metabolites include <b>cyclosporin</b> B, C, D, E, H, L, and others. Ciclosporin metabolites {{have been found to}} have lower immunosuppressant activity than CsA (approximately <10%), and are associated with higher nephrotoxicity. Individual ciclosporin metabolites have been isolated and characterized but {{do not appear to be}} extensively studied.|$|E
25|$|Reassurance {{that the}} {{condition}} is benign, elimination of precipitating factors and improving oral hygiene are considered initial management for symptomatic OLP, and these measures are reported to be useful. Treatment usually involves topical corticosteroids (such as betamethasone, clobetasol, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone) and analgesics, or if these are ineffective and {{the condition is}} severe, the systemic corticosteroids may be used. Calcineurin inhibitors (such as pimecrolimus, tacrolimus or <b>cyclosporin)</b> are sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|Initially, rapamycin was {{developed}} as an antifungal drug against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans. Few years later its immunosuppressive properties were detected. Later studies {{led to the}} establishment of rapamycin as a major immunosuppressant against transplant rejection, along with cyclosporine A. By using rapamycin in combination with <b>cyclosporin</b> A, it enhanced the rejection prevention in renal transplantation. Therefore, it was possible to use lower doses of cyclosporine which minimized toxicity of the drug.|$|E
500|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} to prepare {{bioactive}} molecules such as Streptokinase from the bacterium Streptococcus, <b>Cyclosporin</b> A from the ascomycete fungus Tolypocladium inflatum, and [...] statins produced by the yeast Monascus purpureus.|$|E
500|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} for many {{commercial}} and industrial purposes, including the production of chemicals, enzymes and other bioactive molecules, often through protein engineering. For example, acetic acid is produced by the [...] bacterium Acetobacter aceti, while citric acid is produced by the fungus Aspergillus niger. Microorganisms are used to prepare a widening range of bioactive molecules and enzymes. For example, Streptokinase produced by the bacterium Streptococcus and modified by genetic engineering is used to remove clots from the blood vessels of patients who have suffered a heart attack. <b>Cyclosporin</b> A is an immunosuppressive agent in organ transplantation, while statins produced by the yeast Monascus purpureus serve as blood cholesterol lowering agents, competitively inhibiting the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cyclosporin</b> is {{synthesized}} by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, <b>cyclosporin</b> synthetase. The enzyme {{contains an}} adenylation domain, a thiolation domain, a condensation domain, and an N-methyltransferase domain. The adenylation domain {{is responsible for}} substrate recognition and activation, whereas the thiolation domain covalently binds the adenylated amino acids to phosphopantetheine, and the condensation domain elongates the peptide chain. <b>Cyclosporin</b> synthetase substrates include L-valine, L-leucine, L-alanine, glycine, 2-aminobutyric acid, 4-methylthreonine, and D-alanine, which is the starting amino acid in the biosynthetic process. With the adenylation domain, <b>cyclosporin</b> synthetase generates the acyl-adenylated amino acids, then covalently binds the amino acid to phosphopantetheine through a thioester linkage. Some of the amino acid substrates become N-methylated by S-adenosyl methionine. The cyclization step releases <b>cyclosporin</b> from the enzyme. Amino acids such as D-Ala and butenyl-methyl-L-threonine indicate <b>cyclosporin</b> synthetase requires the action of other enzymes such as a D-alanine racemase. The racemization of L-Ala to D-Ala is pyridoxal phosphate-dependent. The formation of butenyl-methyl-L-threonine is performed by a butenyl-methyl-L-threonine polyketide synthase that uses acetate/malonate as its starting material.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immunosuppressive}} {{effect of the}} natural product <b>cyclosporin</b> was discovered in December 1971 in a screening test on immune suppression designed and implemented by Hartmann F. St√§helin at Sandoz. [...] The chemical structure of <b>cyclosporin</b> was determined in 1976, also at Sandoz. The success of the drug candidate ciclosporin in preventing organ rejection was shown in kidney transplants by R.Y. Calne and colleagues at the University of Cambridge, and in liver transplants performed by Thomas Starzl at the University of Pittsburgh Hospital. The first patient, on 9 March 1980, was a 28-year-old woman. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ciclosporin for clinical use in 1983.|$|E
2500|$|The {{natural product}} was named <b>cyclosporin</b> by the German {{speaking}} scientists who first isolated it and cyclosporine when translated into English. Per International Nonproprietary Name (INN) guidelines for drugs, the [...] "y" [...] {{was replaced with}} [...] "i" [...] so that the INN for the drug is spelled ciclosporin.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{commonly}} used agent is methotrexate with other frequently used agents including sulfasalazine and leflunomide. Sodium aurothiomalate (gold) and <b>cyclosporin</b> are less commonly used due to more common adverse effects. Agents {{may be used in}} combinations. [...] Methotrexate is the most important and useful DMARD and is usually the first treatment. [...] Adverse effects should be monitored regularly with toxicity including gastrointestinal, hematologic, pulmonary, and hepatic. Side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain can be reduced by taking folic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most other}} allografts, a liver {{transplant}} will be rejected by the recipient unless immunosuppressive drugs are used. [...] The immunosuppressive regimens for all solid organ transplants are fairly similar, {{and a variety of}} agents are now available. [...] Most liver transplant recipients receive corticosteroids plus a calcineurin inhibitor such as tacrolimus or ciclosporin, (also spelled cyclosporine and <b>cyclosporin)</b> plus a purine antagonist such as mycophenolate mofetil. Clinical outcome is better with tacrolimus than with ciclosporin {{during the first year of}} liver transplantation. If the patient has a co-morbidity such as active hepatitis B, high doses of hepatitis B immunoglubins are administrated in liver transplant patients.|$|E
2500|$|In DIGO, {{improved}} {{oral hygiene}} and plaque control is still important {{to help reduce}} any inflammatory component that may be contributing to the overgrowth. Reversing and preventing gingival enlargement caused by drugs {{is as easy as}} ceasing drug therapy or substituting to another drug. [...] However, this is not always an option; in such a situation, alternative drug therapy may be employed, if possible, to avoid this deleterious side effect. [...] In the case of immunosuppression, tacrolimus is an available alternative which results in much less severe gingival overgrowth than <b>cyclosporin,</b> but is similarly as nephrotoxic. [...] The dihydropyridine derivative isradipidine can replace nifedipine for some uses of calcium channel blocking and does not induce gingival overgrowth.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{peptides}} are synthesized by ribosomes, but <b>cyclosporin</b> is a cyclic nonribosomal peptide of 11 {{amino acids}} and contains a single D-amino acid, which is rarely encountered in nature.Some sources list the fungus under an alternative species name Hypocladium inflatum gams such as Pritchard and Sneader in 2005:* [...] * [...] However, the name, [...] "Beauveria nivea", also appears {{in several other}} articles including in a 2001 online publication by Harriet Upton entitled [...] " [...] " [...] (retrieved June 19, 2005). Mark Plotkin states in his book Medicine Quest, Penguin Books 2001, pages 46-47, that in 1996 mycology researcher Kathie Hodge [...] {{that it is in}} fact a species of Cordyceps.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{anti-infective}} medications {{have been}} derived from fungi including penicillin and the cephalosporins (antibacterial drugs from Penicillium chrysogenum and Cephalosporium acremonium, respectively) and griseofulvin (an antifungal drug from Penicillium griseofulvum). [...] Other medicinally useful fungal metabolites include lovastatin (from Pleurotus ostreatus), {{which became a}} lead {{for a series of}} drugs that lower cholesterol levels, <b>cyclosporin</b> (from Tolypocladium inflatum), which is used to suppress the immune response after organ transplant operations, and ergometrine (from Claviceps spp.), which acts as a vasoconstrictor, and is used to prevent bleeding after childbirth. Asperlicin (from Aspergillus alliaceus) is another example. [...] Asperlicin is a novel antagonist of cholecystokinin, a neurotransmitter thought to be involved in panic attacks, and could potentially be used to treat anxiety.|$|E
50|$|The {{immunosuppressant}} drug <b>cyclosporin</b> A blocks a calcium-dependent {{signal from the}} T-cell receptor (TCR) that normally leads to T-cell activation. When bound to cyclophilin B, <b>cyclosporin</b> A binds and inactivates the key signaling intermediate calcineurin. The protein encoded by this gene functions similarly to <b>cyclosporin</b> A, binding to cyclophilin B and acting downstream of the TCR and upstream of calcineurin by causing an influx of calcium. This integral membrane protein {{appears to be a}} new participant in the calcium signal transduction pathway, implicating cyclophilin B in calcium signaling, {{even in the absence of}} <b>cyclosporin.</b>|$|E
