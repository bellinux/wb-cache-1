40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to give a {{comprehensive}} view of the legal regulation of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> and limitation of the ownership right to land. This thesis is divided into eight chapters, where the introductory part is followed by six chapters and the conclusion. The first chapter briefly explains the basic institutes {{with an emphasis on}} the uniqueness of the land. The second chapter discusses the conditions of expropriation. The third chapter focuses on <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> land expropriation. The fourth chapter deals with the limitation of the ownership right to land. The fifth chapter analyzes <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> the limitation of the ownership right to land. The sixth chapter describes selected Acts of environmental law in the perspective of fourth and fifth chapter. In conclusion, this diploma thesis summarizes the main findings. As regards <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> expropriation, the legislation is not stable and allows unjustified differences between landowners. As for the limitation of the ownership right to land, the situation regarding the provision of compensation is not always clear and there are some gaps in the legislation. However, these can be overcome by case-law...|$|R

Much to the delight of the then president, Rev C. W.

In other words, the capital sum invested would have to provide an annual return comparable (at least) to the previous annual grant in order to safeguard the financial running of the college, of which the trustees, the only legally constituted religious corporation in Ireland, were now the legal proprietors...|$|R
50|$|The most {{intensive}} - {{and less}} well-known - use of Scud missiles {{occurred during the}} civil war in Afghanistan between 1989 and 1992. As <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> the <b>withdrawal</b> of Soviet troops in 1989, the USSR agreed to deliver sophisticated weapons to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA), among which were large quantities of Scud-Bs, and possibly some Scud-Cs as well. The first 500 were transferred during the early months of 1989, and soon proved to be a critical strategic asset for the DRA. Every Scud battery was composed of three TELs, three reloading vehicles, a mobile meteorological unit, one tanker and several command and control trucks. During the mujahideen attack against Jalalabad, between March and June 1989, three firing batteries manned by Afghan crews advised by Soviets fired approximately 438 missiles in defense of the embattled garrison. Soon all the heavily contested areas of Afghanistan, such as the Salang Pass and the city of Kandahar, were under attack by Scud missiles.|$|R
50|$|As <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> the <b>withdrawal</b> of Soviet {{troops in}} 1989, the USSR agreed to deliver {{sophisticated}} {{weapons to the}} regime, among which were large quantities of Scud surface-to-surface missiles. The first 500 were transferred during {{the early months of}} 1989, and soon proved to be a critical strategic asset. During the mujahideen attack against Jalalabad, between March and June 1989, three firing batteries manned by Afghan crews advised by Soviets fired approximately 438 missiles. Soon Scuds were in use in all the heavily contested areas of Afghanistan. After January 1992, the Soviet advisors were withdrawn, reducing the Afghan Army's ability to use their ballistic missiles. On April 24, 1992, the mujahideen forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud captured the main Scud stockpile at Afshur. As the communist government collapsed, the few remaining Scuds and their TELs were divided among the rival factions fighting for power. However, the lack of trained personnel prevented a sustained use of such weapons, and, between April 1992 and 1996, only 44 Scuds were fired in Afghanistan.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper first {{introduces}} the fisheries management dilemma faced by many Asian developing countries including Thailand {{and the key}} elements of a transition policy towards responsible fisheries. It then analyses current fisheries management costs in Thai marine fisheries. Major cost items include fisheries research (especially stock assessment), monitoring, control and surveillance, the placement of artificial reefs to rehabilitate inshore resources and to act as barrier against bottom trawling, and management administration. It then examines the required adjustments needed for improved management {{in order to increase}} the flow of net economic benefits and to reduce conflicts among fishermen using different types of fishing gear. The authors argue that in the Thai situation characterized by significant over-capacities large up-front adjustment costs arise in the transition to an effective fisheries management regime. These include <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> the <b>withdrawal</b> of excessive fleet capacity, costs of facilitating the shift to alternative employment, and other incremental fisheries management costs. On the example of the Thai demersal fisheries in the Gulf of Thailand, it is shown that these large up-front adjustment costs could be recuperated in the long run through increased fishing licence fees but that the immediate financial needs may pose a heavy burden on the government budget that may justify external financial assistance...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is a cell {{messenger}} {{with multiple}} actions in different biological systems, {{implicated in the}} control of follicle and oocyte function. NO is formed from L-arginine by isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) via N-G-hydroxy-L-arginine, with L-citrulline as a byproduct. This study aimed to show how modulation of NO by manipulating NOS substrates would affect mouse follicle growth and ovulation in vitro, where vascular effects of NO are attenuated. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry [endothelial (eNOS) and inducible (iNOS) ] and in situ hybridization (iNOS) were applied on mouse ovaries. Cultured follicles were also stained for iNOS by immunohistochemistry. For follicles cultured in {{the presence or absence}} of L-arginine, the ability of L-citrulline or N-G-hydroxy-L-arginine to substitute for L-arginine was assessed in terms of follicle growth and ovulation. RESULTS: iNOS and eNOS were localized in oocytes and theca, with some staining in granulosa. iNOS mRNA occurred predominantly in granulosa and oocyte. Omission Of L-arginine significantly reduced follicle survival and ovulation. Partial <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> L-arginine <b>withdrawal</b> was achieved with L-citrulline and N-G-hydroxy-L-arginine. Specific abnormalities of follicle growth were noted. CONCLUSIONS: NOS is present in mouse follicles, and its action is necessary at a local level for normal follicle development in vitro. Reduced growth, persistent basement membranes and reduced ovulation were associated with in vitro disruption of NO...|$|R

40|$|Summary We test {{a causal}} model of entrepreneurs' role {{stressors}} [...] role conflict, role ambiguity, and role overload [...] and {{their relationships with}} exhaustion and reduced perceptions of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> one's efforts which over time {{lead to the development}} of a proclivity <b>for</b> venture <b>withdrawal.</b> Using structural equation modelling and a 2 -year longitudinal data set, we find empirical support for the proposed causal model. Overall, the empirical results support the indirect influence of role stressors and highlight the direct effects of enhanced exhaustion and reduced perceptions of <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> one's efforts on a proclivity for a new venture withdrawal. The paper concludes by proposing implications for theory and further research. Entrepreneur role stressors Role conflict Role ambiguity Role overload Withdrawal...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) affects 0. 5 - 1 % {{of population}} {{all over the}} world. As the duration of treatment is more in RA, patient′s adherence to treatment is less. Controlling {{the number of patients}} lost to follow-up is essential for the successful completion of randomized clinical trials. Also, patient adherence is critical in clinical trial setting as it has impact on validity of clinical data and also it remains an issue of utmost importance to pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as scientific and regulatory community. The studies which show reasons <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from clinical trials are done for diseases like tuberculosis (TB). None of the study is available to find reasons <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from clinical trials in RA. Hence, this study is planned. Aims and Objectives: Find reasons and effect of age, sex, duration of therapy, and distance from home on withdrawal from clinical trial. Materials and Methods: This study is a retrospective observational data analysis. Primary outcome are to find reasons <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from trial. Results: Withdrawal from clinical trial in patients of RA is more in female. In this study, reasons <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from study are change in location, loss to follow-up, failure of therapy, concomitant illness, patient withdrew consent, and adverse effects is the common reason <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from clinical trial in both patient and investigator-related reason <b>for</b> <b>withdrawal...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} whether <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation in fricative–vowel syllables is phonologically mediated or {{a consequence of}} auditory processes. Smits (2001 a) had shown that <b>compensation</b> occurs <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in a fricative caused by a following rounded vowel in Dutch. In a first experiment, the possibility that compensation is due to general auditory processing was investigated using nonspeech sounds. These did not cause context effects akin to <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation, although nonspeech sounds influenced speech sound identification in an integrative fashion. In a second experiment, a possible phonological basis <b>for</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> coarticulation was assessed by using audiovisual speech. Visual displays, which induced the perception of a rounded vowel, also influenced <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in the fricative. These results indicate that <b>compensation</b> <b>for</b> anticipatory lip rounding in fricative–vowel syllables is phonologically mediated. This result is discussed {{in the light of}} other compensation-for-coarticulation findings and general theories of speech perception...|$|R
