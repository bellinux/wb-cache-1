25|$|At present, most {{trousers}} {{are held}} {{up through the}} assistance of a belt which is passed through the belt loops on the waistband of the trousers. However, this was traditionally a style acceptable only for casual trousers and work trousers; suit trousers and formal trousers were suspended by the use of braces (suspenders in American English) attached to buttons located on the interior or exterior of the waistband. Today, this remains the preferred method of trouser support amongst adherents of classical British tailoring. Many men claim this method is more effective and more comfortable because it requires no <b>cinching</b> of the waist or periodic adjustment.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} came the Tour's first summit finish, and Velits and Martin both struggled. Velits lost four minutes and 15 seconds by {{finishing}} 31st, having been {{caught up in}} a crash at one point. Martin lost just over nine minutes by finishing 48th. Velits remained the team's highest-placed overall rider after the stage, but he fell to 14th place. The next two mountain stages were no kinder, as Velits fell to 16th after stage 14 and Martin well out of any possible contention in 35th. Stage 15 was the last stage branded as flat before the traditional flat final stage on the Champs-Élysées. Cavendish and the leadout train did not disappoint, as he took another dominant win, this time over Farrar in second. Stages 18 and 19 could have been problematic for Cavendish. Both were difficult mountain stages with summit finishes, meaning the disqualification time cut was a concern. He did in fact finish outside the time cut on stage 18, but since more than half the peloton did likewise, the group was not disqualified from the Tour. They were each individually assessed a 25-point penalty in the points classification instead. This narrowed Cavendish's lead over José Joaquín Rojas to only 15 points. A similar result happened the next day on Alpe d'Huez, with Cavendish again finishing in the last group on the road and outside the time cut. Again close to half the peloton was in the group, so they were not removed from the Tour, and since Rojas also fell in the group this time, he too was assessed the 25-point penalty. This meant the true effect was essentially nil, effectively <b>cinching</b> the green jersey for Cavendish.|$|E
2500|$|During Ancient Egyptian times, {{the perfect}} woman {{was said to}} have a slender figure, with narrow shoulders, and a tall waist. Yet, females were emboldened in their beauty habits and general independence. Standards were {{reformed}} in Ancient Greece, when society began worshipping the male figure instead. As men faced greater pressures on beauty and perfection, women sported a fuller and plump figure, with fair skin tones becoming more popular. The pale skin craze was soon adopted in the Han Dynasty, but waist sizes narrowed. Overall figures shrunk, as the Chinese associated petite with femininity. With the need to reflect her husband’s status, the behaviours and outward appearances of the wife grew incredible crucial during the Italian Renaissance. Since size was linked to wealth, women maintained bodies with full hips and an ample bosom. The Victorian Era witnessed a similar movement, but the popularity of the corset <b>cinching</b> the waist, led to the desirable hourglass figure. The era also introduced the Gibson Girl, which was the first sign of influence by the fashion and media industries. Created by Charles Gibson, he envisioned femininity as slim and tall, with large busts and wide hips, but a narrow waist. These girls were also often shown in magazines such as Harper’s Bazaar and LIFE, which resulted in a link between trendy fashions and styles, and the maintenance of active lifestyles and healthy well-beings ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{traditional}} western <b>cinch</b> {{was made}} of multiple strands of heavy cords, usually made of mohair, or, in cheaper designs, cotton. Modern designs are also made of synthetic fiber or a synthetic-mohair blend. The number of cords used varies with width and design, but the standard range is from 17 to 30 strands, creating an end product that is 4 to 7 inches wide at the widest point {{in the center of}} the <b>cinch.</b> This design is sometimes known as a [...] "string", [...] "strand," [...] "cord" [...] or [...] "rope" [...] <b>cinch.</b> Each cord is knotted around a large ring, called a <b>cinch</b> ring, placed at either end. In the center, additional cording or very heavy thread is used to gather all the cords into a set width and make the <b>cinch</b> lie flat. Wider <b>cinches</b> are narrowed to fit the <b>cinch</b> ring by allowing two layers of cord to form at the ring, sometimes aided by decorative weaving that stabilizes the cords.|$|R
50|$|When used, a back <b>cinch,</b> made {{of several}} {{thicknesses}} of leather, is held on {{by a simple}} heavy leather billet {{on each side of}} the saddle that buckles just tight enough to touch the underside of the horse, but not tight enough to provoke discomfort or bucking. At the belly midline, the front and back <b>cinches</b> are joined by a light belly strap, called a <b>cinch</b> hobble, that prevents the back <b>cinch</b> from moving too far back.|$|R
40|$|The {{modified}} O'Connor <b>cinch</b> {{operation is}} a useful, but little used, adjustable resection operation. For increased {{understanding of its}} shortening and adjustment characteristics, a standard <b>cinch</b> was performed in animals and patients with strabismus. Animal studies showed that, as each strand of the <b>cinch</b> was removed, a small, relatively equal release of the <b>cinch</b> effect occurred. Measurement of the shortening obtained in patients with strabismus showed a consistent resection effect of about 4 mm. Review of 17 {{cases in which the}} <b>cinch</b> was used as part of the surgical treatment showed the technique to be adjustable by reducing the overcorrection in 6 cases. Ten to 20 prism dioptres of reduction in the deviation was obtained with adjustment of the <b>cinch</b> on the first postoperative day. All 17 cases had satisfactory adjustment. The largest residual deviation was 12 prism dioptres...|$|R

60|$|A bearskin-coated {{policeman}} stepped prominently to the fore, {{watch in}} hand. Men hurried among the dogs, rousing {{them to their}} feet, untangling their traces, straightening them out. The entries came to the mark, firmly gripping stakes and notices. They had gone over {{the boundaries of the}} claim so often that they could now have done it blindfolded. The policeman raised his hand. Casting off their superfluous furs and blankets, and with a final <b>cinching</b> of belts, they came to attention.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cinch</b> {{attaches}} to the saddle {{by means of a}} latigo on either side. The latigo is a wide, flexible strap, usually of leather, though nylon webbing is also seen. The latigo is attached to the off (right) side of the saddle at the saddle's <b>cinch</b> ring or [...] "dee ring", doubled in thickness and knotted or buckled to the <b>cinch,</b> usually kept attached to both <b>cinch</b> and saddle at all times, except to make fitting adjustments. The latigo on the near (left) side is attached to the saddle at all times, but the loose end is used to secure the saddle for riding by running it through the left <b>cinch</b> ring one or more times, back through the saddle's dee ring, and then finally buckled or knotted when tight. It is loosened and removed from the <b>cinch</b> to take off the saddle.|$|R
50|$|A saddle {{that has}} only a <b>cinch</b> in the front is “single rigged”. A saddle that has both a front <b>cinch</b> and a back <b>cinch</b> (sometimes called a flank <b>cinch,</b> even though it should never go around the horse's flanks) is “double rigged”. The rear rigging is meant to {{stabilize}} the saddle. The back <b>cinch</b> is always located just below the cantle and held in place with a <b>cinch</b> hobble {{to prevent it from}} slipping back; however, the position of the front rigging varies. The rig positions are named by how far they are from the cantle to the fork. Placement of the front rigging is a critical component of western saddle design. The closer the rigging is {{to the center of the}} saddle, the more the rider will be balanced over the horse's center of balance, allowing freer movement and agility of horse and rider. On the other hand, the more forward the rigging is set, especially when combined with a back <b>cinch,</b> the more the saddle will set down on the horse, placing the rider a bit behind the horse's center of balance, but creating greater security.|$|R
5000|$|The front <b>cinch</b> is {{secured to}} the saddle {{by means of}} a latigo on the left, and on the right, by either a latigo or a billet. Latigos are not removed until worn out or broken. They run through the ring or buckle of the <b>cinch</b> (also called a <b>cinch</b> ring), and back to the rigging, {{sometimes}} multiple times for extra security. Modern latigos have several holes at the end so that a <b>cinch</b> can be buckled at a set tension, though the <b>cinch</b> may also be secured by a knot called a [...] "latigo knot," [...] which is a type of half-hitch. The off-side billet is a shorter, doubled piece of leather with holes along its length, somewhat heavier and less flexible than latigo leather. It runs through the rigging <b>cinch</b> ring and both ends buckle onto the <b>cinch.</b> Older saddles may use a latigo on the off side, but this is less common. Once adjusted to the horse, an off-side latigo or billet is seldom disconnected from the <b>cinch,</b> which remains attached to the saddle until it needs to be replaced, unlike the girth of an English saddle, which is to be removed on both sides when not in use. While leather is preferred for latigos, nylon web is sometimes used, particularly on cheaper saddles, though it is prone to slip when knotted and the holes may tear more easily.|$|R

And Bob, beyond spirited restlessness and a few playful attempts, gave no trouble. Nor in the hour's ride that followed, save for some permissible curveting and prancing, did he misbehave. Daylight was delighted; the purchase was immediately made; and Bob, with riding gear and personal equipment, was despatched across the bay forthwith to take up his quarters in the stables of the Oakland Riding Academy.|$|E

Bate Wood, however, touched his sombrero and said: [...] "Mornin', miss." [...] Joan {{wondered}} if her memory of the preceding night were only a bad dream. There was a different atmosphere by daylight, and it was dominated by Kells. Presently she returned to camp refreshed and hungry. Gulden was throwing a pack, which action he performed with ease and dexterity. Pearce was <b>cinching</b> her saddle. Kells was talking, more like his old self than at any time since his injury.|$|E

50|$|The Goodnight western sidesaddle {{that was}} {{developed}} in the 1870s by Charles Goodnight for his wife was a double rigged design. Goodnight developed this sidesaddle because there was a need to produce a woman's saddle for daily riding and work on the range. The saddle also had to fit a variety of horses on a day-to-day basis. it required two <b>cinches.</b> The <b>cinches</b> have a connecting strap, called a <b>cinch</b> hobble, to keep the rear girth from slipping back, which would cause the horse to buck. The girthing system still produced a shimmy in the rear, even though the rear <b>cinch</b> was brought up snugly against the horse. The double girthing system was not as secure as the balance strap seen on many modern sidesaddles.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Cinching</b> (girthing): The {{method of}} {{securing}} the saddle to the horse. Rather than buckling on {{as does the}} English girth, the Western girth, known as a cinch, is anchored with a flat strap of leather or nylon called a latigo that may be secured with a flat knot, or via holes added so that a buckle can be used, either {{in place of the}} knot or in addition to one.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, women's fashion was highly ornate and {{dependent}} on a precise fit, so ready-to-wear garments for women did not become widely available {{until the beginning of}} the 20th century. Before, women would alter their previously styled clothing in order to stay up to date with fashion trends. Women with larger incomes purchased new, fully tailored clothing in current styles while middle-class and lower-class women adjusted their clothing to fit changes in fashion by adding new neck collars, shortening skirts, or <b>cinching</b> shirt waists.|$|E
