5|$|To ease her heartbreak and the {{rejection}} from her family, Silk turns to alcohol and chain smoking. She gains weight, <b>causing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> {{her status as}} a sex symbol. Silk approaches Silva Ganesh with an offer to produce a film together. Ultimately, the audience and industry has lost interest in her, and the film fails. On the other hand, Abraham directs a film {{which turns out to}} be a huge hit, and he feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that his films do not need any sexualisation to be successful. Having lost her fame and fortune, Silk has accumulated so much debt that she approaches a small-time filmmaker, willing to take on any role. She is shocked to find that he wants her to do a pornographic film, and she refuses. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming, without her permission. The place is raided by the police but Silk manages to escape.|$|E

Soon after, Maxine's site is merged with a larger company that uses Susan's image to advertise the website on billboards across the country. Susan pays the company $9,000 to have the billboards removed. As a result, she begins working for the website's video chatting services to earn back the money. Paul discovers her secret and threatens to expose it unless she sells him her home, in which he now lives with his second wife, Beth (Emily Bergl). Hoping to derail Paul's blackmail scheme, Susan tells Mike about her job on the website.

25|$|Suddenly {{there was}} a series of ear-splitting explosions, as Fame dropped a pattern of 10 depth charges. The lights in U-353 went out and water entered forward and aft through the {{hydrophone}} shafts. The electric motors stopped working, {{all but one of the}} depth gauges broke, and the aft hydroplanes were put out of action. U-353 went deeper, almost out of control as water poured in through the stern torpedo tube <b>causing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> trim. The U-boat blew her tanks and surfaced, and the captain ordered the crew to prepare to abandon ship.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of ChickFight, Dave Prazak and Allison Danger set up Shimmer Women Athletes, a {{promotion}} with ties to Prazak's Ring of Honor intending to raise the credibility of women's wrestling on an international scale. Her first match with the promotion was on November 6, 2005, for Volume 1 in a losing effort to MsChif, starting a wild feud between the two. The loss saw Anderson demand a special attraction rematch—the match would be Shimmer's first hardcore match, fought under Falls Count Anywhere rules and helped Anderson gain the victory after nearly thirty minutes of wrestling on February 12, 2006, at Volume 4. MsChif took her revenge at Volume 5 by distracting Anderson during a match with Allison Danger, <b>causing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> the match. Naturally the rivalry was not abated and their next match, main eventing Volume 6 on 21 May, was declared a Last Woman Standing match with MsChif eventually coming out on top. Further interferences took an interesting turn at Volume 7 when Anderson came out during MsChif's match against Rain. However, before she could interfere, Rain's partner Lacey pushed {{her to the ground}} while trying to distract the referee in order to allow Rain to use an illegal weapon; an incensed Anderson fought back against Lacey in time for the referee to see the foreign object in the ring and declare MsChif the winner via disqualification. After Anderson had won her main event match, Lacey and Rain (The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew), ambushed her with a beat down until MsChif ran out, saving her nemesis before leaving her to celebrate the victory. The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew had threatened Anderson for involving herself in their plans against MsChif and similarly threatened MsChif for being in the way of ambushing Melissa and, after declaring themselves the best tag team in the world, demanded a match with the two for Volume 8 which became the penultimate bout of the evening. The Home Wrecking Crew's experience won out over MsChif and Anderson when a double team maneuver led to MsChif being pinned; after the match Anderson and MsChif shook hands as a sign of respect. The two soon showed they could work as a team though when they beat veterans The Experience (Lexie Fyfe and Malia Hosaka), with MsChif pinning Hosaka.|$|E

[...] Tracer, known as Cadet Oxton during this time in the narrative, is also heard as the narrator of the video, where she details that [...] sent her in {{as a part of a}} strike team to stop an attack from Null Sector, an Omnic extremist group. In July, Blizzard released another animated origin story video, this time focusing on the character Doomfist. The video features Tracer, along with Genji and Winston, battling Doomfist; at one point, Doomfist is seen disabling Tracer's chronal accelerator, <b>causing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> her synchronization with the flow of time.|$|E
500|$|What {{is certain}} though is that Adventure turned her {{guns on the}} two ships and fired. [...] The {{broadside}} was devastating; in an instant, Maynard had lost {{as much as a}} third of his forces. [...] About 20on Jane were either wounded or killed and 9on Ranger. [...] Hyde was dead and his second and third officers either dead or seriously injured. [...] His sloop was so badly damaged that it played no further role in the attack. [...] Again, contemporary accounts of what happened next are confused, but small-arms fire from Jane may have cut Adventures jib sheet, <b>causing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> control and run onto the sandbar. [...] In the aftermath of Teach's overwhelming attack, Jane and Ranger may also have been grounded; the battle would have become a race to see who could float their ship first.|$|E
500|$|Howe {{first came}} upon USS Cabot, whose captain was Esek Hopkins' son John. Glasgow hailed Cabot for identification, {{to which the}} younger Hopkins replied, [...] "The USS Columbus and USS Alfred, a 22-gun frigate." [...] An overzealous seaman on his ship then tossed a grenade onto Glasgows deck and the battle was engaged. Cabot, a lightly armed brig, fired one {{ineffective}} broadside of six-pound cannon shot. Glasgow countered with two broadsides from its heavier weaponry, killing Cabot master, wounding Hopkins, and disabling the ship's steering. As Cabot drifted away, USS Alfred came up to engage Glasgow and the two commenced a broadside duel. A shot from Glasgow early in the action broke the lines to Alfred tiller, <b>causing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> steering and exposing her to raking fire. Her drift also {{made it difficult for}} Biddle's Andrew Doria to join the action, because the ship also had to maneuver to avoid the drifting Cabot. USS Providence held back; USS Columbus was able to join the action late, but her fire was so wild that little to no damage was done to Glasgow.|$|E

500|$|When in 995 Michinaga's two {{brothers}} Fujiwara no Michitaka and Fujiwara no Michikane died leaving the regency vacant, Michinaga quickly won {{a power struggle}} against his nephew Fujiwara no Korechika (brother to Teishi, Emperor Ichijō's wife), and, aided by his sister Senshi, he assumed power. Teishi had supported her brother Korechika, who was later discredited and banished from court, <b>causing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> power. Four years later Michinaga sent Shōshi, his eldest daughter, to Emperor Ichijō's harem {{when she was about}} 12. A year after placing Shōshi in the imperial harem, in an effort to undermine Teishi's influence and increase Shōshi's standing, Michinaga had her named Empress although Teishi already held the title. As historian Donald Shively explains, [...] "Michinaga shocked even his admirers by arranging for the unprecedented appointment of Teishi (or Sadako) and Shōshi as concurrent empresses of the same emperor, Teishi holding the usual title of [...] "Lustrous Heir-bearer" [...] kōgō and Shōshi that of [...] "Inner Palatine" [...] (chūgū), a toponymically derived equivalent coined for the occasion". About five years later, Michinaga brought Murasaki to Shōshi's court, in a position that Bowring describes as a companion-tutor.|$|E

At Royal Rumble, Chyna (kayfabe) injured her neck during a match with Ivory, <b>causing</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> the match {{and fail to}} capture the Women's Championship. In order for Chyna to again challenge for the title, Ivory required the match contract to include a [...] "hold harmless" [...] clause, stating that if Ivory injures Chyna's neck again, {{there could be no}} legal recourse against Ivory. In doing so, the contract also included a provision to ban Ivory's Right To Censor stablemates from ringside. After an early bit of offense from Ivory, Chyna performed a Chynabomb and looked to have the pinfall, but picked Ivory up after the 2 count. Chyna then performed a gorilla press drop and nonchalantly pinned Ivory to win the Women's Championship.|$|E

Both her older brothers, Rohan and Sunny, are often seen using Nikki for their own benefit, although Rohan shows that he cares about her deeply. Sunny seems to dislike Nikki the most although, in some episodes, he is seen being quite fond of her. Himani thinks of Nikki as the perfect baby. It was revealed in [...] "Nikki is 1!"

Bobby was born on her birthday; she responded to this by [...] "I like this present."
