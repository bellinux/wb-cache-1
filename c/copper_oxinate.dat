40|$|The {{distribution}} equilibria of oxine or <b>copper</b> <b>oxinate</b> between naphthalene 	and {{aqueous phase}} were studied by {{the method of}} liquid-liquid extraction 	followed by solid-liquid separation using naphthalene as the solvent, and 	compared with the result obtained by the conventional method of liquid-liquid 	extraction using chloroform as the solvent. In a previous paper, Fujinaga, 	Kuwamoto, Nakayama and the author showed that the <b>copper</b> <b>oxinate</b> was 	extracted quantitatively into naphthalene at 90 °C in the pH range larger than 	 4. This extraction behavior is quite identical to that into chloroform at room 	temperature, {{in spite of the}} difference in the experimental temperature and 	of the solvent used. The present investgation was performed to elucidate the 	reason of this similarity of both method in the extraction of <b>copper</b> <b>oxinate</b> 	and to determine the equilibrium data of oxine and <b>copper</b> <b>oxinate</b> at 90 °C...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{liquid-liquid}} extraction of <b>copper</b> <b>oxinate</b> with melted 	naphthalene followed by solid-liquid separation {{has been proposed}} by Fujinaga 	et al for the trace analysis of copper. In this experiment, the pH of sample 	solution was adjusted to 3. 5 - 12 after oxine solution was added. The solution 	was then heated on a water bath at about 90 °C, shaken vigorously after the 	addition of naphthalene as the solvent to extract <b>copper</b> <b>oxinate,</b> and stood 	still at room temperature. The solidified naphthalene phase was washed with 	distilled water by decantation, dissolved and diluted to a definite volume with 	benzene. The optical absorbancy at 420 nm was measured to determine the 	amount of copper. Beer's law was obeyed {{with the amount of}} copper up to 100 	μg in 10 ml of benzene...|$|E
