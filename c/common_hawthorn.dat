5|$|The green rosella is {{predominantly}} herbivorous, with {{the seeds of}} grasses and trees—especially eucalypts—forming the bulk of its diet; other items eaten include the seed of the soft tree fern (Dicksonia antarctica), cranberry heath (Astroloma humifusum), myrtle beech (Lophozonia cunninghamii), Australian blackwood (Acacia melanoxylon), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) and buttercups (Ranunculus), berries, nuts and fruit, as well as flowers and new buds of southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), shining tea-tree (Leptospermum nitidum), swamp honey-myrtle (Melaleuca squamea), Tasmanian bluegum (Eucalyptus globulus), Smithton peppermint (Eucalyptus nitida), messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua), snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora), manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), small-fruit hakea (Hakea microcarpa) and native plum (Cenarrhenes nitida). The green rosella has at times partaken of the berries of the <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn</b> (Crataegus monogyna), as well as Coprosma and Cyathodes, and even leaf buds of the common osier (Salix viminalis). It may eat insect larvae and insects such as psyllids of the genus Schedotrioza, which they extract from leaf galls on the black peppermint (Eucalyptus amygdalina).|$|E
500|$|Trees held an {{important}} place in Gaelic culture {{from the earliest}} times. Particularly large trees were venerated, and the most valuable such as oak, Common Hazel and Apple were classed as [...] "nobles". The less important Common Alder, <b>Common</b> <b>Hawthorn</b> and [...] Gean were classed as [...] "commoners", and there were [...] "lower orders" [...] and [...] "slaves" [...] such as Eurasian Aspen and Juniper. The alphabet was learned as a mnemonic using tree names. Rowan was regularly planted close to Highland houses as a protection from witchcraft.|$|E
500|$|A {{specimen}} of <b>Common</b> <b>Hawthorn</b> found at Glastonbury, first mentioned {{in an early}} sixteenth century anonymous metrical Lyfe of Joseph of Arimathea, was unusual in that it flowered twice in a year, once as normal on [...] "old wood" [...] in spring, and once on [...] "new wood" [...] (the current season's matured new growth) in the winter. This tree has been widely propagated by grafting or cuttings, with the cultivar name 'Biflora' or 'Praecox'. The custom of sending a budded branch of the Glastonbury thorn to the Queen at Christmas was initiated by James Montague, Bishop of Bath and Wells during James I's reign, who sent a branch to Queen Anne, King James I's consort. Trees survive from earlier grafts to perpetuate the Glastonbury legend, among them two other Holy Thorns in the grounds of St John’s Church in Glastonbury. The blossom sent to the Queen now comes from one of these.|$|E

The Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) predominates over great expanses of the rocky heights and sheltered slopes. On moist shady slopes, normally facing north, or in sheltered places, the common oak (Quercus robur) is widespread.

50|$|Linnaeus {{introduced}} the name Crataegus oxyacantha for {{a species of}} Northern European Hawthorn and the name gradually became used for several similar species which were assumed to be the same, particularly the Midland Hawthorn C. laevigata and the <b>Common</b> <b>Hawthorn</b> C. monogyna. In 1946 Dandy showed that Linnaeus had actually observed and described a single-styled species similar to the <b>Common</b> <b>Hawthorn,</b> and the Midland Hawthorn was effectively a later discovery. However, Byatt showed that confusion over the true identity of C. oxyacantha remained, and the name was formally rejected as ambiguous by the International Botanical Congress. More recently, Christensen concluded that the species studied by Linnaeus matches C. rhipidophylla Gand., a relatively rare species.|$|E

50|$|In the past, midland {{hawthorn}} {{was widely}} but incorrectly {{known by the}} name C oxyacantha, a name that has now been rejected as being of uncertain application. In 1753 Linnaeus introduced the name C oxyacantha for the single species {{of which he was}} aware, but described {{it in such a way}} that the name became used for various species, including both the midland and the <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn.</b> In 1775 Jacquin formally separated the <b>common</b> <b>hawthorn,</b> naming it C monogyna, and in 1946 Dandy showed that Linnaeus had actually observed a different plant, and this would be C. oxyacantha. However, by this time confusion over the true identity of C oxyacantha was so great that Byatt proposed that the name should be formally rejected as ambiguous, and this proposal was accepted by the International Botanical Congress, although the name continues to be used informally.|$|E
