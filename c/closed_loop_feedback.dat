50|$|There is no {{mechanical}} linkage between the accelerator pedal and the throttle valve with electronic throttle control. Instead, {{the position of}} the throttle valve (i.e., the amount of air in the engine) is fully controlled by the ETC software via the electric motor. But just opening or closing the throttle valve by sending a new signal to the electric motor is an open loop condition and leads to inaccurate control. Thus, most if not all current ETC systems use <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>feedback</b> systems, such as PID control, whereby the ECU tells the throttle to open or close a certain amount. The throttle position sensor(s) are continually read and then the software makes appropriate adjustments to reach the desired amount of engine power.|$|E

50|$|Commercial CNC {{metalworking}} machines use <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>feedback</b> {{controls for}} axis movement. In a closed loop system, the control {{is aware of}} the actual position of the axis at all times. With proper control programming, this will reduce the possibility of a crash, but it is still up to the operator and programmer to ensure that the machine is operated in a safe manner. However, during the 2000s and 2010s, the software for machining simulation has been maturing rapidly, and it is no longer uncommon for the entire machine tool envelope (including all axes, spindles, chucks, turrets, tool holders, tailstocks, fixtures, clamps, and stock) to be modeled accurately with 3D solid models, which allows the simulation software to predict fairly accurately whether a cycle will involve a crash. Although such simulation is not new, its accuracy and market penetration are changing considerably because of computing advancements.|$|E
50|$|Adaptive {{collaborative}} {{control is}} most accurately modeled as a <b>closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>feedback</b> control system. <b>Closed</b> <b>loop</b> <b>feedback</b> control describes the event where the outputs {{of a system}} from an input are used to influence the present or future behavior of the system. The feedback control model is governed {{by a set of}} equations that are used to predict the future state of the simuland and regulate its behavior. These equations - in conjunction with principles of control theory - are used to evolve physical operations of the simuland to include, but not limited to: dialogue, path planning, motion, monitoring, and lifting objects over time. Many times, these equations are modeled as nonlinear partial differential equations over a continuous time domain. Due to their complexity, powerful computers are necessary to implement these models. A consequence of using computers to simulate these models is that continuous systems cannot be fully calculated. Instead, numerical solutions, such as the Runge-Kutta methods, are utilized to approximate these continuous models. These equations are initialized from the response of one or more sources and rates of changes and outputs are calculated. These rates of changes predict the states of the simuland a short time in the future. The time increment for this prediction is called a time step. These new states are applied to the model to determine the new rates of changes and observational data. This behavior is continued until the desired number of iterations is completed. In the event a future state violates or comes within a tolerance of the violation the simuland will confer with its human counterpart seeking advice on how to proceed from that point. The outputs, or observational data, are used by the human operators to determine what they believe is the best course of action for the simuland. Their commands are fed with the input into the control system and assessed regarding its effectiveness in resolving the issues. If the human commands are determined to be valuable, the simuland will adjust its control input to what the human suggested. If the human’s commands are determined to be unbeneficial, malicious, or non-existent, the model will seek its own correction approach.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new {{configuration}} of smart structures {{which could be}} automatically adjusted according to changes of forcing frequencies is proposed for vibration suppression. The new configuration is a laminated beam-plate or wide beam composed of layers of piezoelectric sensors and actuators and Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires embedded in the middle plane of the laminated structure. The structural natural frequencies can be adjusted closely to the forcing frequencies by adjusting electric heating for controlling temperature of SMA. In each layer, the piezoelectric sensors and actuators whose electrode are trimmed to modal shapes in conjunction with proper control algorithm, to achieve expected control effects. The sensors and actuators are connected with each other {{if they have the}} same shapes and they are linked together by a controller to form a <b>close</b> <b>loop</b> <b>feedback</b> control.
