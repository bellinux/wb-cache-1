50|$|Yield mapping or yield {{monitoring}} is {{a technique}} in agriculture of using GPS data to analyze variables such as crop yield and moisture content in a given field. It {{was developed in the}} 1990s and uses a combination of GPS technology and physical sensors, such as speedometers, to track <b>crop</b> yields, grain <b>elevator</b> speed, and combine speed.|$|R
2500|$|The Š-3's upright inline {{engine was}} {{completely}} enclosed within a cowling, with its top {{just below the}} pilot's eye line. It drove a two-blade propeller with a domed spinner. [...] The BMW was cooled with Lamblin cylindrical radiators placed between the undercarriage legs, though a diagram shows it with narrow, fuselage-hugging (cheek) radiators. The oval cross-section fuselage tapered rearwards behind the cockpit to a straight tapered tailplane and divided elevators with a cutout for rudder movement; the latter was mounted on a circular-edged fin and had its bottom <b>cropped</b> for <b>elevator</b> clearance. [...] The Š-3 had a fixed, single-axle conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on cross-braced V-struts.|$|R
25|$|Its {{fuselage}} was {{a simple}} rectangular cross section wooden structure skinned with plywood. The single seat, open, unscreened cockpit was immediately below the leading edge. The landing skid was mounted {{on the front end}} of a curved, deep, covered frame on the fuselage underside, separating from it aft and rubber sprung well clear towards its end. The fuselage tapered rearwards, where there was a small tail bumper. The tail was {{different from that of the}} BS.16; although the same triangular tailplane and parallel chord, <b>cropped</b> tipped <b>elevators</b> were used, they were mounted on top of a low, straight edged fin. A new, large, balanced, angular rudder, hinged at the extreme tail extended down to the keel, operated in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|R
50|$|For the 1920 <b>crop</b> year, Eastern <b>Elevator</b> was {{determined}} to have a surplus of 1,107,330 pounds, found in its elevator at Port Arthur, Ontario. The Board commenced an action in the Exchequer Court of Canada to recover the value of such grain, which was calculated to be $43,431. Eastern Elevator, in its defence, pleaded there was no surplus, and that s. 95(7), as well as The Canada Grain Act itself, always were and are now ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.|$|R
50|$|The {{tail unit}} was conventional, with {{trapezoidal}} {{horizontal and vertical}} surfaces. The tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage and was braced to the fin by a single strut on each side. The control surfaces were unbalanced and {{the bottom of the}} rudder was <b>cropped</b> to allow <b>elevator</b> movement. The JG.40 had fixed landing gear, with split axles and drag struts hinged from the central fuselage underside and with vertical Messier oleo-legs from the forward wing spars. The mainwheels had hydraulic brakes. The castoring tailwheel was also on an oleo strut.|$|R
2500|$|Like some Zöglings, the Hols der Teufel had a light nacelle, ending {{under the}} wing at a forward leaning {{vertical}} knife edge around the aft central wing strut, enclosing both the pilot's seat {{and the other}} supporting struts. [...] Aft, the cross braced girder had a horizontal upper beam onto which the tailplane was mounted, strut braced from below. Its leading edge was straight and strongly swept; the <b>cropped,</b> parallel chord <b>elevators</b> had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames. Its upright, near rectangular rudder was hinged on the extended, final vertical frame member. The Hols der Teufel landed on a rubber sprung skid which ran from the nose to a little beyond the aft lift struts.|$|R
50|$|The Poppenhausen had a light nacelle {{fuselage}} extending {{well behind}} the wing trailing edge and ending at a forward leaning vertical knife edge.The forward cockpit was largely {{ahead of the}} leading edge and the rear one under the wing. Behind the wing the fuselage had the same flat, cross braced girder form as the Hols der Teufel, with a horizontal upper beam, its first diagonal brace within the nacelle. The tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} horizontal beam, its leading edge straight and strongly swept. <b>Cropped,</b> parallel chord <b>elevators</b> had a central cut out for rudder movement. The fin was under the tailplane, formed by fabric covering between the last two vertical fuselage fames. Its upright, balanced, near rectangular rudder was hinged on the extended, final vertical frame member. The Poppenhausen landed on a rubber sprung skid which ran from the nose to a little beyond the aft lift struts.|$|R
50|$|The BS.17's wings were, {{like those}} of the BS.16, {{rectangular}} in plan apart from clipped aileron tips. Mounted without dihedral, the two separate wings were built around a pair of spars, one close to the leading edge with plywood covering forward from it around the edge forming a torsion-resistant D-box. Behind it the wing was fabric covered. Centrally, the wings were supported over the fuselage on the same cross braced trapezoidal structure used originally on the BS.16 and later on several other Bonomi gliders. The wings were braced with an asymmetric, faired wooden V strut on each side, attached to the lower fuselage and running to the wing spars at about mid-span. Its fuselage was a simple rectangular cross section wooden structure skinned with plywood. The single seat, open, unscreened cockpit was immediately below the leading edge. The landing skid was mounted on the front end of a curved, deep, covered frame on the fuselage underside, separating from it aft and rubber sprung well clear towards its end. The fuselage tapered rearwards, where there was a small tail bumper. The tail was {{different from that of the}} BS.16; although the same triangular tailplane and parallel chord, <b>cropped</b> tipped <b>elevators</b> were used, they were mounted on top of a low, straight edged fin. A new, large, balanced, angular rudder, hinged at the extreme tail extended down to the keel, operated in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|R
50|$|The usual claim {{involves}} patent infringement due to intentionally replanting patented seed. Such {{activity was}} unanimously {{found by the}} United States Supreme Court to constitute patent infringement in Bowman v. Monsanto Co. (2013). The case began in 2007, when Monsanto sued Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman who in 1999 bought seed for his second planting from a grain elevator - the same elevator that he and others sold their transgenic <b>crops.</b> The <b>elevator</b> sold the soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. Bowman tested the new seeds, and found that as he had expected, some were resistant to glyphosate. He intentionally replanted his harvest of GM seeds in subsequent years, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities. Monsanto stated that he was infringing their patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were new products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman stated {{that he had not}} infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of seed to whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. In 2009 the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto; on appeal, the Federal Circuit upheld the verdict. Bowman appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which granted review, then unanimously affirmed the Federal Circuit on May 13, 2013.|$|R

40|$|President Obama has {{exhibited}} a steadfast determination {{to respond with}} conciliation to intemperate and relentless demands by his political opponents that he dismantle regulation because it is undermining the nation’s economy. Viewed {{from the perspective of}} winning either political support or the basis for compromise with Republican legislative leaders, his concessions seem not only to have failed, but have also made matters significantly worse because, as negotiation experts would remind us, responding to highly competitive negotiation tactics with conciliation incites escalating confrontations and even more extreme demands. The Article uses the Administration’s decision to kill a proposed rule updating “hazardous orders” under the Fair Labor Standards Act for children as young as twelve who work in agriculture. The proposal was issued {{in the context of a}} series of gruesome incidents involving teenagers as young as fourteen who were smothered in grain elevators or lost legs to giant augers used to remove <b>crops</b> from <b>elevators</b> and silos. The Department of Labor terminated the rulemaking without even reading the thousands of comments it had received, in part because the American Farm Bureau Federation and its congressional allies grossly distorted the substance of the rule. The long-term implications of this and similar decisions to subject rulemaking to short-term political calculations will be remembered long after the President leaves office. In the maddening, heavily politicized scrum where regulatory decisions are up for grabs these days, the long-standing tradition of expertise-driven administrative decision making is hanging by a thread, dooming Executive Branch agencies to shy away from controversial rulemaking regarding public health, worker and consumer safety, and the environment in the absence of a statutory mandate, no matter how pressing the problem. Or, as Professor Thomas McGarity rightly warns us, the era of “blood sport rulemaking” is now upon us, with the inevitable result that even the resolution of business-on-business disputes will become far more expensive and unpredictable...|$|R
