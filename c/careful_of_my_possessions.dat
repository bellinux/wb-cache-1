6000|$|The Chair. [...] "Order! Sit down, if you please--both of you. Neither of {{the notes}} {{has been out}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possession</b> at any moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't understand," [...] Katharine faltered at last. [...] "That packet has {{not been}} out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possession,</b> and I saw the notes put into it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you refer}} to the {{contents}} of that letter, it was written and handed to me about three hours ago. It has not been out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possession</b> since then." ...|$|R
60|$|ACRES But my honour, David, my honour! I {{must be very}} <b>careful</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> honour.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{arrived at}} six o'clock, and went {{straight}} into the inner pocket <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat; {{it has not been}} out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possession</b> for a single second. Even while I talk to you I can feel it." ...|$|R
60|$|And I am <b>careful</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> work, too. Why, some of {{the work}} that I have by me now has been in <b>my</b> <b>possession</b> for years and years, and there isn’t a {{finger-mark}} on it. I take a great pride in my work; I take it down now and then and dust it. No man keeps his work in a better state of preservation than I do.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I've sacrificed {{the best}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> and {{destroyed}} {{the confidence of}} folks who, to serve their ends, would have helped me on. Isn't that a serious thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That whoever made {{it had a}} {{good eye}} for the most {{valuable}} locations in this district," [...] I answered, thoughtfully. [...] "He has also shaded with the same tint part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> in Crane Valley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he continued, [...] "I've sacrificed {{the best}} half <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> and have {{destroyed}} {{the confidence of}} the people who, to serve their ends, would have helped me on. Isn't that a serious thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{arrived at}} six o'clock," [...] the {{ambassador}} declared. [...] "It went {{straight into the}} inner pocket <b>of</b> <b>my</b> coat; {{it has not been}} out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possession</b> for a single second. Even whilst I talk to you I can feel it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--no--'tis impossible! This lady {{never had}} a child. Powis, you have been deceived by some fancied, or some real resemblance. This picture is mine, {{and has not been}} out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possession</b> these five and twenty years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cortes is in Spain, {{pleading}} his suit. He has wed a {{new wife}} there, Teule. Many {{years ago he}} put me away, giving me in marriage to Don Juan Xaramillo, who took me because <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possessions,</b> for Cortes dealt liberally with me, his discarded mistress.' And she began to weep.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your Highness," [...] he cried, [...] "none deny your power. Let it be {{mingled with}} mercy. It is excellent, as an English poet will {{say in a}} few hundred years, to have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant. Take the half <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possessions,</b> but spare <b>my</b> son-in-law." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{might have}} been {{anticipated}} from the state <b>of</b> <b>my</b> companion’s edible supplies, I found my own in a deplorable condition, and diminished to a quantity {{that would not have}} formed half a dozen mouthfuls for a hungry man who was partial enough to tobacco not to mind swallowing it. A few morsels of bread, with a fathom or two of white cotton cloth, and several pounds of choice pigtail, composed the extent <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possessions.</b>|$|R
60|$|I had as I before observed, one private pocket, which escaped their search, wherein {{there was}} a pair of {{spectacles}} (which I sometimes use for the weakness of mine eyes,) a pocket perspective, and some other little conveniences; which, being of no consequence to the emperor, I did not think myself bound in honour to discover, and I apprehended they might be lost or spoiled if I ventured them out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possession.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah,' he said, 'that is the {{bag that}} was offered {{me this morning}} for three hundred sequins. Those must be the women who caused Izif and Izouf to dance, and took from them the two talismans of the daughters of Siroco. They only can break the spell that has been cast on us. Let them be found and I will gladly give them the half <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possessions.</b> Idiot that I was to send them away!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. H. I {{think you}} have said it once or twice before. You're growing very <b>careful</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> feelings. My God, Pip, I was a good woman once! You said I was. You've made me what I am. What {{are you going to}} do with me? What {{are you going to do}} with me? Won't you say that you are sorry? (Helps herself to iced asparagus.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} {{convince}} her {{that there was no}} reason to suppose that the man who had assisted her could not be living at this day. He need only be about one hundred years old, and that age was not uncommon. I affirmed most earnestly that the ring had never been out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possession,</b> and that I should not have come to her if I had not believed that she would remember my services, and be at least willing to make good the considerable sums I had expended in her behalf.|$|R
6000|$|... "That list," [...] Norgate went on, [...] "is in my pocket. I may {{add that}} {{although}} I {{was careful to}} keep up the fiction of not understanding German, and although I informed Herr Selingman that I had seen the paper in question blow out of the window, he nevertheless gave me that night a drugged whisky and soda, and during the time I slept he must have been through every one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possessions.</b> I found <b>my</b> few letters and papers turned upside down, and even my pockets had been ransacked." ...|$|R
60|$|Leon. When love did <b>of</b> <b>my</b> heart <b>possession</b> take, I was so young, my {{soul was}} scarce awake: I cannot tell when first I thought you fair; But sucked in love, insensibly as air.|$|R
6000|$|Be <b>careful</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> guest--his {{safety is}} most {{precious}} to me. [...] Should aught happen to him, {{or if he}} be missed, spare nothing [...] to find him and ensure his safety. He is English and therefore [...] adventurous. There are often dangers from snow and wolves and [...] night. Lose not a moment if you suspect harm to him. I answer [...] your zeal with my fortune.--Dracula.|$|R
60|$|She {{smiled at}} me a little curiously. All the time I felt somehow that she was taking very <b>careful</b> note <b>of</b> <b>my</b> answers.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{creature}} of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. I must be <b>careful</b> <b>of</b> you, <b>my</b> treasure: nerves like yours {{were not made}} for rough handling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could have}} shared {{just a little}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> good fortune with him," [...] I said to Zulime, who really was as stately as a queen. But the best <b>of</b> all <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> I would not, could not, share with any one--I mean the adoration <b>of</b> <b>my</b> little daughters to whom I possessed the majesty of an emperor.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am curious," [...] I said, {{leaning against}} the table and facing him, [...] "I am curious to know which <b>of</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>possessions</b> can {{possibly}} be of interest or value to the Prince of Malors." ...|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after passing}} the spring, Sureflint led {{me out to}} a cleared spot on the eminence, which {{commanded}} an extensive view of most of that part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possessions</b> which was under lease and occupied. Here we halted, seating ourselves on a fallen tree, for which one could never go amiss in that region, and at that day; and I examined the view with the interest which ownership is apt to create in us all. The earth is very beautiful in itself; but it is most beautiful {{in the eye of}} those who have the largest stake in it, I fear.|$|R
60|$|MALET (aside to HAROLD). Be <b>careful</b> <b>of</b> thine answer, <b>my</b> good friend.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Captain," [...] said Singleton, [...] "I'll {{accept the}} latter duty, the more willingly that I {{wish to have}} a <b>careful</b> {{examination}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> botanical specimens." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{document}} {{has never}} been out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possession,</b> sir," [...] he said. [...] "It has not even left my person. My friend Mr. Jones {{does not believe in}} too much secrecy in matters of this sort. I have had a good deal of experience now and am inclined to agree with him. A letter in a double-ended envelope, stuck all over with sealing wax, is pretty certain to be opened in case of any accident to the bearer. This one, as you may not have noticed, is written in the same handwriting and addressed {{in the same manner as}} the remainder <b>of</b> <b>my</b> letters <b>of</b> introduction to various London and Paris houses of business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Be <b>careful</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> gifts, good man; {{see that}} you do not lose the ring or forget to water the pinks. As for your daughter, I promise you that she shall be more {{beautiful}} than anyone you ever saw in your life; call her Felicia, and when she grows up give her the ring and the pot of pinks to console her for her poverty.' Take them both, then, my dear child," [...] he added, [...] "and your brother shall have everything else." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cherbonnier {{received}} {{praise for}} his efforts early in his career. In 1952, Reinhold Niebuhr expressed gratitude to Cherbonnier in his Preface to The Irony Of American History [...] "for <b>careful</b> reading <b>of</b> <b>my</b> manuscript and for many suggestions for its improvement".|$|R
6000|$|CENCI: The third <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possessions!</b> I {{must use}} Close husbandry, or gold, the old man's sword, Falls from my {{withered}} hand. But yesterday There came {{an order from}} the Pope to make Fourfold provision for my cursed sons; [...] 130 Whom I had sent from Rome to Salamanca, Hoping some accident might cut them off; And meaning if I could to starve them there. I pray thee, God, send some quick death upon them! Bernardo and my wife could not be worse [...] 135 If dead and damned:--then, as to Beatrice-- [LOOKING AROUND HIM SUSPICIOUSLY.] I think they cannot hear me at that door; What if they should? And yet I need not speak Though the heart triumphs with itself in words. O, thou most silent air, that shalt not hear [...] 140 What now I think! Thou, pavement, which I tread Towards her chamber,--let your echoes talk <b>Of</b> <b>my</b> imperious step scorning surprise, But not <b>of</b> <b>my</b> intent!--Andrea! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O thou great Emmanuel, Lord {{of all the}} world, I know thee that {{thou art}} the Son of the great Shaddai! Wherefore art thou come to torment me, and to cast me out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>possession?</b> This town <b>of</b> Mansoul, as thou very well knowest, is mine, and that by twofold right. 1. It is mine by right of conquest, I won it in the open field. And shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive be delivered? 2. This town of Mansoul is mine also by their subjection. They have opened the gates of their town unto me, they have sworn {{fidelity}} to me, and have openly chosen me to be their king. They have also given their castle into my hands; yea, they have put the whole strength of Mansoul under me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} think that after you had eaten this food it would turn to stones again and make you sick," [...] she remarked; [...] "but that would be impossible. Nothing I {{transform}} ever gets back to its former shape again, so these fish-balls can never more be pebbles. That is why I have to be <b>careful</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> transformations," [...] she added, busily eating while she talked, [...] "for while I can change forms at will I can never change them back again--which proves that even the powers of a clever Yookoohoo are limited. When I have transformed you three people, you must always wear the shapes that I have given you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This carriage," [...] said he, [...] "is at your disposal; collect your baggage {{as rapidly}} as {{you can make it}} convenient, and my {{servants}} will conduct you to a villa in the neighbourhood of Paris where you can wait in some degree of comfort until I have had time to arrange your situation. You will find there a pleasant garden, a library of good authors, a cook, a cellar, and some good cigars, which I recommend to your attention. Jerome," [...] he added, turning to one of the servants, [...] "you have heard what I say; I leave Mr. Scrymgeour in your charge; you will, I know, be <b>careful</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friend." ...|$|R
60|$|I summoned Syddall to the library. He came, {{but came}} {{attended}} by the eternal Andrew, who, dreaming of great things in consequence <b>of</b> <b>my</b> taking <b>possession</b> <b>of</b> the Hall and the annexed estates, was resolved to lose nothing {{for want of}} keeping himself in view; and, as often happens to men who entertain selfish objects, overshot his mark, and rendered his attentions tedious and inconvenient.|$|R
