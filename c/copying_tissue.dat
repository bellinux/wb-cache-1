40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} blood and <b>tissue</b> <b>copy</b> number distribution during Mycoplasma haemofelis infection and determine if sequestration of organisms in body tissues could explain blood copy number cycling in infected cats. Thirteen domestic-shorthaired cats were used. Blood samples were regularly collected, and at a differing time point post-infection for each cat, tissue samples also collected, for quantitative PCR (qPCR). Absolute haemoplasma copy numbers were calculated for all blood and tissue samples, as well as an estimation of the ratio of <b>tissue</b> haemoplasma <b>copy</b> number to that expected in the tissue if a positive qPCR result arose due to tissue blood supply alone. Cats with high or moderate M. haemofelis blood copy numbers at the time of tissue collection had fewer M. haemofelis <b>copies</b> in most <b>tissues</b> than expected due to the tissue blood supply alone; only splenic and lung tissues consistently contained more M. haemofelis. However tissues collected from cats at a time of very low M. haemofelis blood copy numbers, when putative copy number cycling nadirs were occurring, were usually qPCR negative. Hence no evidence of significant tissue M. haemofelis sequestration was found in this study to explain the copy number cycling reported with this feline haemoplasma species...|$|R

40|$|Theories {{predict that}} the {{long-term}} survival of duplicated genes requires their functional diversification, which {{can be accomplished by}} either subfunctionalization (the partitioning of ancestral functions among duplicates) or neofunctionalization (the acquisition of novel function). Here, we characterize the CDY-related mammalian gene family, focusing on three aspects of its evolution: gene <b>copy</b> number, <b>tissue</b> expression profile and amino acid sequence. We show that the progenitor of this gene family arose de novo in the mammalian ancestor via domain accretion. This progenitor later duplicated to generate CDYL and CDYL 2, two autosomal genes found in all extant mammals. Prior to human-mouse divergence (and perhaps preceding the eutherian radiation), a processed CDYL transcript retroposed onto the Y chromosome to create CDY, the Y-linked member of the family. In the simian lineage, CDY was retained and subsequently amplified on the Y. In non-simian mammals, however, CDY appears to have been lost. The retention of the Y-linked CDY genes in simians spurred the process of subfunctionalization and possibly neofunctionalization. Subfunctionalization is evidenced by the observation that simian CDYL and CDYL 2 retained their somatic housekeeping transcripts but lost the spermatogenic transcripts to the newly arisen CDY. Neo-functionalization is suggested by the rapid evolution of the CDY protein sequence. Thus, the CDY-related family offers an instructive example of how duplicated genes undergo functional diversification in both expression profile and protein sequence. It also supports the previously postulated notion that there is a tendency for spermatogenic functions to transfer from autosomes to the Y chromosome...|$|R

Peak hFIX expression following the highest dose of vector (2 × 1012 pcr-vector genomes (vg) /kg) was 21 ± 3  µg/ml (~ 420 % of normal). Fluorescent in-situ hybridization demonstrated scAAV provirus in almost 100 % of hepatocytes at that dose.

These traits are not characteristic of the progenitor strains (C 57 BL/ 6 J and C 3 H/HeJ) or of 11 other BXH recombinant inbred strains. Since B-tropic virus expression may be causally related to the high incidence of lymphoma in this strain, we have analyzed the ecotropic MuLV DNA content of both normal and lymphomatous tissues of BXH- 2 mice. Southern analysis and hybridization with an ecotropic MuLV DNA-specific probe showed that DNA of normal BXH- 2 tissues contained both parental N-tropic MuLV proviruses but lacked endogenous B-tropic MuLV DNA sequences. In addition, none of 116 F 1 hybrid mice derived from male BXH- 2 mice spontaneously produced ecotropic MuLV early in life. These results suggest that the B-tropic virus is horizontally transmitted in BXH- 2 mice. Southern analysis of DNA from tumor tissues of 12 BXH- 2 mice showed that amplification of ecotropic-specific DNA sequences had occurred in lymphomatous tissues of 3 mice and suggested that these tumors were monoclonal. The number of newly acquired proviruses, which appeared to be structurally nondefective and integrated at different sites, varied from one to three <b>copies.</b> Since lymphomatous <b>tissues</b> from only 3 of 12 mice examined carried additional detectable ecotropic proviruses, these results suggest that amplification of ecotropic MuLV DNA sequences is not required for maintenance of transformation in BXH- 2 lymphomas...|$|R

These results were correlated to anatomopathological alterations in the heart and gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Of the 23 patients studied, 18 presented the cardiac form and five presented the cardiodigestive form of Chagas disease. DNA samples were randomly isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of heart and GIT tissue of 23 necropsies and were analyzed through NPCR amplification. T. cruzi DNA was detected by NPCR in 48 / 56 (85. 7 %) heart and 35 / 42 (83. 3 %) GIT samples from patients with the cardiac form.

40|$|Despite {{remarkable}} {{progress in}} understanding biology and disease {{at the level}} of nucleic acids, insights into the relevant biochemical processes frequently remain preliminary, since much regulation and activity occurs at the protein level through control of gene expression and variations of protein conformation. In particular, the effect of such variations on protein interactions is critical for a better description of biology and disease. Protein microarray technology provides a means to such ends and is a growing field of proteomics, with a high potential for analytical and functional applications in biology and medicine. On the basis of sequence information from individuals, it is possible to characterize disease-specific protein isoforms that result from mutations, polymorphisms, and splice variants with personalized protein microarrays. During my thesis, I developed such a technique. As a first step, solid-phase PCR is applied to <b>copy</b> a particular <b>tissue’s</b> RNA/cDNA onto the microarray surface, using for each gene a specific primer pair that is attached to the chip surface. The generated DNA templates are firmly attached to and specifically oriented on the array surface. The solid-phase PCR successfully amplified DNA of up to 3 kb, also allowing multiplex amplification of DNA. The arrayed DNA copies then act as templates for an in situ cell-free expression, yielding a protein microarray that presents the protein content of a particular tissue of an individual person. Expression control was conducted by a multiple spotting technique (MIST). C-terminus detection showed that translation was complete, yielding full-length proteins. During the process of setting up the technique of producing individualized protein microarrays, the MIST technology was optimized concomitantly. The various steps involved were analyzed to determine optimal conditions for template preparation, protein expression and interaction detection.

Our in vivo study showed that the virus FAdV- 94, lacking six open reading frames (ORFs) at the left end of its genome, replicates less efficiently than wild-type FAdV- 9 (wtFAdV- 9) in chickens that were infected intramus-cularly. However, the fecal-oral route is the natural route of FAdV infection, and the oral administration of a vaccine confers some advantages compared to administration through other routes, especially when developing an adenovirus as a vaccine vec-tor. Therefore, we sought to investigate the effects of FAdV- 9 in orally inoculated chickens. In the present study, we orally inocu-lated specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens with FAdV- 9 and FAdV- 94 and assessed virus shedding, antibody response, and viral genome copy number and cytokine gene expression in tissues.

These {{are central to the}} efficacy of certain immunotherapies and while they have been shown to have prognostic power in breast and colorectal cancer, they have been investigated less in ovarian cancer. Five <b>copies</b> of a <b>tissue</b> microarray representing 339 cases of ovarian cancer which presented to Derby City General Hospital between 1982 and 1997 were made. The array was stained for CK 7, CK 20, CA 125, CEA, p 53 and Bcl- 2 following a standard immunohistochemical protocol. A linked clinical database was adapted and assessed for data consistency and subsequently used to analyse the prognostic and clinicopathological associations of the expression data. The array was then stained for HLA class I, B 2 microglobulin and CD 59 using commercial antibodies and for CD 55 and CD 46 using in-house antibodies. Retained expression of HLA class I molecules independently predicted improved prognosis. High expression of CD 55 and CD 59 were associated with worse prognosis, though not independently of other factors. CD 55 expression was more widespread than previously appreciated. This thesis describes the discovery of a new independent marker of prognosis which suggests that immunoediting occurs in ovarian cancer, describes the distribution of markers known to {{have a negative impact on}} immunotherapy in ovarian cancer in a large series for the first time and documents the production of a valuable resource for future studies.

40|$|Dengue is a mosquito-borne {{disease that}} has been an {{epidemic}} in China for many years. Aedes albopictus is the dominant Aedes mosquito species and the main vector of dengue in China. Epidemiologically, dengue mainly occurs in Guangdong Province; it does not occur or rarely occurs {{in other areas of}} mainland China. This distribution may be associated with climate, mosquito density, and other factors in different regions; however, the effect of temperature on the vector competence of Ae. albopictus for dengue viruses (DENV) remains unclear. In this study, Ae. albopictus was orally infected with dengue virus 2 (DENV- 2) and reared at constant temperatures (18, 23, 28, and 32 °C) and a fluctuating temperature (28 – 23 – 18 °C). The infection status of the midguts, ovaries, and salivary glands of each mosquito was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at 0, 5, 10, and 15 days post-infection (dpi). DENV- 2 RNA <b>copies</b> from positive <b>tissues</b> were quantified by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). At 18 °C, DENV- 2 proliferated slowly in the midgut of Ae. albopictus, and the virus could not spread to the salivary glands. At 23 and 28 °C, DENV- 2 was detected in the ovaries and salivary glands at 10 dpi. The rates of infection, dissemination, population transmission, and DENV- 2 copies at 28 °C were higher than those at 23 °C at any time point. At 32 °C, the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) for DENV- 2 in Ae. albopictus was only 5 dpi, and the vector competence was the highest among all the temperatures. Compared with 28 °C, at 28 – 23 – 18 °C, the positive rate and the amount of DENV- 2 in the salivary glands were significantly lower. Therefore, temperature is an important factor affecting the vector competence of Ae. albopictus for DENV- 2. Within the suitable temperature range, the replication of DENV- 2 in Ae. albopictus accelerated, and the EIP was shorter with a higher temperature. Our results provide a guide for vector control and an experimental basis for differences in the spatial distribution of dengue cases...|$|R
