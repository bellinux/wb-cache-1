Clutter in TWI is due to many reasons like wall coupling, antenna coupling, multiple reflections etc. To analyze the clutter reduction techniques, firstly we indigenously assembled a TWI system (i. e., step frequency continuous wave radar (SFCW)) in UWB range (freq. 3. 95 GHz to 5. 85 GHz), and different observations have been taken. We have considered metallic plate and one more material with low dielectric constant (Teflon) as a target and kept them behind the plywood wall. A-scan and B-scan observations have been carried out. The observed data are preprocessed for imaging and then different types of clutter reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Factor Analysis (FA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) have been applied, and results were analyzed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extension {{in our previous}} research on Ultra Wide Band (UWB) radar using Virtual reference tags (VRTs). VRTs are virtual tags that are mapped over a particular surveillance area. Each tag has its own stored information which is used by radar as a reference point to track the target. In multistatic radar scenario with one transmitter and three receivers UWB pulses are used to locate and track the intruder. These pulses when reflected by intruder are received at three receivers. A hybrid of Time Of Arrival (TOA) and Received Signal Strength (RSS) techniques are used to process the received signal. VRTs not only provide solution to synchronization problems in TOA and RSS techniques but also provide a platform where clutters can be easily removed. In UWB radar for localization of intruder VRTs provide a promising solution of <b>clutter</b> <b>removal</b> by adding information in specific tags. These specific tags can indicate themselves as clutters, which can be identified by the radar.

Typically, however, solutions are still limited to narrow domains or regular formats such as books, forms, articles or letters and operate best on clean documents scanned in a controlled environment. More general collections of heterogeneous documents challenge the basic assumptions of state-of-the-art technology regarding quality, script, content and layout. Our work explores the use of adaptive algorithms for the automated analysis of noisy and complex document collections. We first propose, implement and evaluate an adaptive <b>clutter</b> detection and <b>removal</b> technique for complex binary documents. Our distance transform based technique aims to remove irregular and independent unwanted foreground content while leaving text content untouched. The novelty {{of this approach is}} in its determination of best approximation to clutter-content boundary with text like structures. Second, we describe a page segmentation technique called Voronoi++ for complex layouts which builds upon the state-of-the-art method proposed by Kise [Kise 1999]. Our approach does not assume structured text zones and is designed to handle multi-lingual text in both handwritten and printed form. Voronoi++ is a dynamically adaptive and contextually aware approach that considers components' separation features combined with Docstrum [O'Gorman 1993] based angular and neighborhood features to form provisional zone hypotheses. These provisional zones are then verified based on the context built from local separation and high-level content features. Finally, our research proposes a generic model to segment and to recognize characters for any complex syllabic or non-syllabic script, using font-models.

40|$|Abstract — In space-based {{infrared}} {{ballistic missile}} defense sensor systems, cluttered backgrounds are typically much more intense than the equivalent sensor noise or the targets being detected. Therefore, the development of efficient <b>clutter</b> <b>removal</b> and target preservation/enhancement algorithms is of crucial importance. To meet customer requirements, the advanced clutter rejection algorithms should provide more than 20 dB improvement in detection sensitivity. We propose an adaptive parametric spatial-temporal filtering technique together with the jitter compensation (scene stabilization). The results of simulations and processing of real data show that the developed adaptive spatialtemporal clutter suppression algorithms allow for efficient clutter rejection in all tested situations. Proposed algorithms completely remove heavy clutter {{in the presence of}} substantial jitter and do not require expensive sub-pixel jitter stabilizers. In contrast, spatial-only filters and temporal differencing methods can be used only for weak and relatively correlated clutter. A stand-alone simulator was developed to demonstrate capabilities and performance of various algorithmic approaches. Simulations model various geometries, resolutions, illuminations and meteorological conditions for space-based IR staring sensor systems.

Ground-penetrating radars (GPRs) are key sensors for landmine detection as they are capable of detecting landmines with low metal contents.
