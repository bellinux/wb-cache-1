50|$|A long-bolt or {{through-bolt}} {{engine is}} an internal combustion piston engine where, following usual practice, the cylinder head is held down by bolts or studs. Conventionally the cylinder head is {{bolted to the}} cylinder block and the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> bearings are in turn bolted to the crankcase by separate bolts. In the long-bolt engine however, a single set of long bolts is used, spanning from the cylinder head right through to the crankshaft bearing caps.|$|R

It also houses the main coolant pump which is driven through the same gear-train as the oil pumps.|$|R
50|$|Coolant {{passages}} {{were located}} between the cylinders. The gerotor-type oil pump was {{located at the}} bottom rear of the engine, and provided oil to both the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> bearings and the cylinder heads (via the lifters and pushrods, {{as opposed to a}} drilled passage on LA engines). Chrysler's engineers also redesigned the oil seals on the crankshaft to improve anti-leak seal performance. The oil pan was also made from thicker steel, and was installed with a more leak-resistant silicone-rubber gasket.|$|R

50|$|A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing, {{usually a}} <b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> bearing of a piston engine. Most bearing caps are {{retained}} by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the bearing journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single through bolt passing through the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two blind bolts threaded into the bearing cap from each side.|$|R
50|$|Accommodating {{the longer}} {{swingarm}} {{was another reason}} the CBR1000RR power plant shared nothing with the 954. Shortening the engine compared to the 954 meant rejecting the conventional in-line layout. Instead, engineers positioned the CBR1000RR's <b>crankshaft,</b> <b>main</b> shaft and countershaft in a triangulated configuration, with the countershaft located below the main shaft, dramatically shortening the engine front to back, and moving the swingarm pivot closer to the crankshaft. This configuration was first successfully introduced by Yamaha with the YZF-R1 model in 1998 and inspired superbike design in the following years.|$|R

50|$|The major {{differences}} of the Buick 350 {{in comparison to}} other GM V8s are Buick's deep-skirt engine block construction, the use of cast iron with increased nickel content, {{the use of an}} external oil pump, a forward-mounted distributor, under-square cylinder bore sizing, 3 in <b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> journals, and 6.385 in connecting rods. The Buick 350 also shares an integrated aluminum timing cover, which incorporates the oil pump mechanisms as well, leaving the oil filter exposed to oncoming air for added cooling. The engine garnered a reputation as a rugged and durable engine , and some of the design characteristics of the Buick 350 are found in other Buick-designed GM engines such as the 231 CID L V6 and its 3800 descendants.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Vibration {{behaviour}} of {{an internal}} combustion engine depends on rigid body inertial dynamics, structural modal characteristics of its elasticmembers, tribological behaviour of load-bearing contacts, andpiston-cylinder interactions. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} use amulti-physics approach that addresses all these physical properties in a single integrative model as presented in this paper. This approach can be regarded as holistic and a good aid for detailed design. Part-icular attention is paid to the critical elements in the system, such as load-bearing conjunctions (<b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> bearings) and piston-cylinder wall interactions. Another important feature is the integrated analysis across the physics of motion from microscale fluid film formation to submillimetre structural deformations and onto large displacements of inertial members. In order to succeed in predictions within sensible industrial time scales, analytical methods have been used as far as possible rather than numerical approaches. Model predictions show good agreement with fired engine test data...|$|R
50|$|The Chrysler Slant-6 engines {{used in the}} Plymouth Valiant and Dodge Dart A-body {{models of}} the 1960s and 1970s {{featured}} a 30° inclined design to achieve a lower overall height. Originally designed to be built of aluminum, but after encountering problems in manufacturing the engines in aluminum, they were built in cast iron without changing the design {{to compensate for the}} stronger metal. Although it only had four <b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> bearings instead of the seven used by its competitors, they were the same size as those on the 426 CID L Hemi V8. The Slant-6 achieved some success in racing when engineers utilized the slant of the engine for very long intake ports to boost horsepower by tuning the intake system. After 30 years of production, it was discontinued in favor of V6 engines because it was too long to mount transversely in front-wheel-drive cars.|$|R
50|$|Ring oilers {{were used}} for speeds up to around 1,000 rpm. Above this, the oil tended to be thrown {{centrifugally}} from the ring, rather than carried by it (although it is still currently applied on steam turbines with speeds around 3200 rpm). The bearing must also remain horizontal and stable, so although suitable for <b>crankshaft</b> <b>main</b> bearings, {{they could not be}} used on connecting rod big end bearings. They were not used on vehicles for similar reasons, although the engines concerned at this time were anyway too large and heavy for practical mobile use. Automatic ring oilers were particularly useful for large engines with multiple horizontally opposed cylinders, where it was otherwise difficult to access the central main bearings. Ring oilers were most suited where bearing side-loads were relatively light, but the bearing capacity required more lubrication than could be supplied by a drip feed oiler. For this reason they were widely used on larger electric motors and generators.|$|R

40|$|Torsional {{vibrations}} of reciprocating engines arise due to {{the application}} of periodic combustion forces in the cylinder and the associated inertial forces of rotating Abstract: This paper presents a detailed multi-body numerical nonlinear dynamic model of a single cylinder internal combustion engine. The model comprises all rigid body inertial members, support bearings, joints, couplers, and connections between the various engine components, as well as means of vibration damping. The detailed model is parameterized, thus enabling virtual prototype testing of various engine designs, as well as allowing the engine designer {{to carry out a}} comprehensive noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) investigation of engine performance. This new approach in engine design reduces the conceptual design-to-development cycle time and removes the need for extensive engine testing, which accounts for a considerable cost in engine design and development process. The model incorporates the simultaneous solution of large displacement dynamics of engine components, infinitesimal vibrations of support bearings, and the trapped air-fuel cylinder transient pressures.
