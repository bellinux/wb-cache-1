40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins ""Enhanced 911 " (E 911) service refers to the capability of public safety answering points to automatically receive an emergency caller's location information. An industry association estimates that nearly 82 million 911 calls are placed each year by callers using mobile phones. Wireless E 911 technology provides emergency responders with the location and callback number of a person calling 911 from a mobile phone. The ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 called for GAO to study state and local use of funds collected {{for the purpose of}} wireless E 911 implementation. We are reporting on (1) the progress made in implementing wireless E 911 services throughout the country, (2) the states and localities that have established taxes, fees, or <b>charges</b> <b>for</b> <b>wireless</b> E 911 implementation, and (3) the states or localities that have used funds collected for the purposes of <b>wireless</b> E 911 <b>for</b> unrelated purposes. To address these issues, we surveyed state-level E 911 contacts on the collection and use of E 911 funds. Of the 51 state E 911 contacts (including the District of Columbia) who were asked to participate in our survey, we received 44 responses. We provided the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with a draft of this report and FCC provided technical comments that we incorporated. ...|$|R
