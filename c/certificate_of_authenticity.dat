A four coin set with face values of $30, $75, $150, and $300 respectively were complemented by the high quality artwork that adorned these luxury items. Famed artists such as Robert Bateman and Glen Loates contributed to these collections with polar bear and bird designs.

25|$|The RCM {{created a}} {{medallion}} to honour Elvis Presley. The medal features the word Graceland (above {{an image of}} the mansion and its gates) and an actual denomination of $10. The reverse of the medal features an engraving of Elvis, along with the words The Man/The Music/The Legend. The medallion itself is undated, but as the medal is 10 ounces, one would assume that it was made for the 10th anniversary of the singer's death. Additional information {{can be found in the}} <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> which states that this Elvis Presley medal was authorized by Legendary Coins and struck by the Royal Canadian Mint. The packaging bears a copyright date of 1987, and states that the medal is for commemorative purposes only and is not legal tender.|$|E
25|$|Several {{complaints}} {{were made to}} the guardian of Bradman's name, reputation and copyright, the Bradman Museum, by a number of concerned collectors who knew the items to be highly questionable but no action appeared to be taken until a well-known memorabilia collector, John Alvarez, challenged Reeve and exposed him to the media. At the time of writing, Reeve has decided to cease his lucrative but unethical practice via eBay. Reeve believed that by issuing a <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Authenticity</b> to buyers (confirming his opinion that the signature was genuine) meant that his status as a former International cricketer would add extra credibility to the scam. Several well-known authenticators throughout the world issued press releases to collectors informing them of Reeve's activities in the Bradman memorabilia market.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1994, [...] "Jan van den Bergen" [...] came to {{the auction}} house Karl & Faber in Munich. He claimed to be an art dealer from Orléans and {{presented}} his business card.

2500|$|In 2001 New York {{artist and}} con-artist Alfredo Martinez was {{charged by the}} Federal Bureau of Investigation with {{attempting}} to deceive two art dealers by selling them $185,000 worth of fake drawings put forth as being the work of Basquiat.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s AMT {{released}} brand new kits with new tooling {{for some of}} their old favorites, such as the 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air, 1966 Ford Fairlane GT, 1958 Edsel Pacer, 1960 Ford Starliner and 1957 Chrysler 300. These kits sold fairly well and can still be found on auction sites such as eBay at reasonable prices. The details in these kits far exceeded any from the 1960s. In the late 1990s AMT did something new in releasing pre-assembled and painted versions of these kits. These assembled models were sold as the Masterpiece Series and were nicely packaged in foam, similar to heavier diecast metal Franklin Mint or Danbury Mint models. Each had a <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Authenticity</b> enclosed. These models were beautifully finished and featured whitewall tires along with very detailed and authentically painted engines, suspensions and interiors, much more detailed than any promotional ever was, although these seem to be oriented to the adult collector and not the possible customer. Selections included a 1957 Chrysler 300C, 1960 Ford Starliner, 1962 Chevrolet Impala SS convertible, 1962 Pontiac Catalina SD421, 1966 Buick Riviera {{and a few others}} (Doty 2002b, p87). These ultra detailed models can still be had for less than $30.00 today on eBay and are one of the best bargains around. As assembled kits they were factory-glued together, but the glue used appears to be of high quality and when cared for properly they can be kept in good condition for years.|$|E
500|$|Gardner and Doyle {{sought a}} {{second expert opinion}} from the {{photographic}} company Kodak. Several of the company's technicians examined the enhanced prints, and although they agreed with Snelling that the pictures [...] "showed no signs of being faked", they concluded that [...] "this could not be taken as conclusive evidence... that they were authentic photographs of fairies". Kodak declined to issue a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> Gardner believed that the Kodak technicians might not have examined the photographs entirely objectively, observing that one had commented [...] "after all, as fairies couldn't be true, the photographs must have been faked somehow". The prints were also examined by another photographic company, Ilford, who reported unequivocally that there was [...] "some evidence of faking". Gardner and Doyle, perhaps rather optimistically, interpreted {{the results of the}} three expert evaluations as two in favour of the photographs' authenticity and one against.|$|E
500|$|Fantasia has {{received}} three home video releases. The first, featuring the 1990 restored theatrical version, {{was released on}} VHS, Betamax and LaserDisc on November 1, 1991, {{as part of the}} [...] "Walt Disney Classics" [...] line. The 50-day release prompted 9.25 million advance orders for cassettes and a record 200,000 for discs, doubling the figure of the previous record. The [...] "Deluxe Edition" [...] package included the film, a [...] "making of" [...] feature, a commemorative lithograph, a 16-page booklet, a two-disc soundtrack of the Stokowski score and a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> signed by Roy E. Disney, the nephew of Walt. Fantasia became the biggest-selling sell-through cassette of all time with 14.2 million copies being purchased. The record was surpassed by Beauty and the Beast in December 1992.

50|$|Drewe {{did not try}} to sell {{paintings}} in a vacuum but created false backgrounds for them. He forged <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>authenticity</b> and even invoices of previous sales to establish false provenance and paper trails for the paintings.

He tricked a small Catholic religious order in a village to sign a contract which would verify some of the paintings.|$|R
50|$|In September 1995, Scotland Yard quietly arrested Myatt. He {{had fallen}} out with Drewe and agreed to cooperate.

Police also found evidence that another artist in addition to Myatt might have supplied some of the forgeries.|$|R

500|$|The two-disc DVD release which {{followed}} in October 22, 2002 contained the original theatrical and 20th Anniversary extended {{versions of the}} film. Spielberg personally demanded the release feature both versions. The features on disc one included an introduction with Steven Spielberg, a 20th Anniversary premiere featurette, John Williams' performance at the 2002 premiere and a Space Exploration game. Disc two included a 24-minute documentary about the 20th Anniversary edition changes, a [...] "Reunion" [...] featurette, a trailer, cast and filmmaker bios, production notes, and the still galleries ported from the 1996 LaserDisc set. The two-disc edition, {{as well as a}} three-disc collector's edition containing a [...] "making of" [...] book, a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>authenticity,</b> a film cell, and special features that were unavailable on the two-disc edition, were placed in moratorium on December 31, 2002.

500|$|The Lion King {{was first}} {{released}} on VHS and laserdisc in the United States on March 3, 1995, under Disney's [...] "Masterpiece Collection" [...] video series. The VHS tape contained a special preview for Walt Disney Pictures' then-upcoming animated film Pocahontas, {{in which the}} title character (voiced by Judy Kuhn) sings the musical number [...] "Colors of the Wind". In addition, Deluxe Editions of both formats were released. The VHS Deluxe Edition included the film, an exclusive lithograph of Rafiki and Simba (in some editions), a commemorative [...] "Circle of Life" [...] epigraph, six concept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV show The Making of The Lion King, and a <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>authenticity.</b> The CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs and The Making of The Lion King, and added storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, and a directors' commentary that the VHS edition did not have, on {{a total of four}} double sided discs. The VHS tape quickly became the best-selling videotape of all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold on the first day and ultimately sales totaled more than 30 million before these home video versions went into moratorium in 1997.|$|E
