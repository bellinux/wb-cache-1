They cannot bind to other sugars such as mannose because this sugar will not fit inside the carbohydrate recognition domain without steric hindrance.

50|$|Galectins {{essentially}} bind to glycans featuring galactose and its derivatives. However, physiologically, {{they are}} likely to require lactose or N-aceyllactosamine for significantly strong binding. Generally, the longer the sugar the stronger the interactions. For example, galectin-9 binds to polylactosamine chains with stronger affinity than to an N-acetyllactosamine monomer. This is because more Van der Waals interactions can occur between sugar and binding pocket. Carbohydrate binding is calcium independent, unlike C-type lectins. The strength of ligand binding is determined by a number of factors: The multivalency of both of ligand and the galectin, the length of the carbohydrate and the mode of presentation of ligand to carbohydrate recognition domain. Different galectins have distinct binding specificities for binding oligosaccharides depending on the tissue in which they are expressed and the function that they possess. However, in each case, galactose is essential for binding. <b>Crystallisation</b> <b>experiments</b> of galectins in complex with N-acetyllactosamine show that binding arises due to hydrogen bonding interactions from the carbon-4 and carbon-6 hydroxyl groups of galactose and carbon-3 of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to the side chains of amino acids in the protein.

Moreover, the conventional cubic phase may interfere with the hydrophilic domains of membrane proteins due to the limited size of the aqueous pores.

This phase facilitates a considerable increase in the allowed size of aqueous domains of membrane proteins, and is easily generalised to a conventional vapour diffusion <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiment,</b> including the use of nanoliter drop crystallization robots. The appearance of the sponge phase was confirmed by visual inspection, small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR spectroscopy. Crystals of the reaction centre from Rhodobacter sphaeroides were obtained by a conventional hanging-drop experiment, were harvested directly without the addition of lipase or cryoprotectant, and the structure was refined to 2. 2 Angstroms resolution. In contrast to our earlier lipidic cubic phase reaction centre structure, the mobile ubiquinone could be built and refined.

40|$|The {{temporal}} and spatial growth behaviour of protein crystals, subject to different cooling strategies in protein crystallisation was investigated. Although the impact of temperature and cooling rate on crystal growth of small molecules was well documented, much less has been reported on {{their impact on the}} crystallisation of proteins. In this paper, an experimental set-up is configured to carry out such a study which involves an automatic temperature controlled hot-stage crystalliser fitted with a real-time imaging system. Linbro parallel <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiments</b> (24 -well plate) were also conducted to find the suitable initial conditions {{to be used in the}} hot-stage <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiments,</b> including the initial concentration of HEW lysozyme solutions, precipitate concentration and pH value. It was observed that fast cooling rates at the early stage led to precipitates while slow cooling rates produced crystal nuclei, and very slow cooling rates, much smaller than for small molecules are critical to the growth of the nuclei and the crystals to a desired shape. The interesting results provide valuable insight as well as experimental proof of the feasibility and effectiveness of cooling as a means for achieving controlled protein crystallisation, compared with the evaporation approach which was widely used to grow single large crystals for X-ray diffraction study. Since cooling rate control can be easily achieved and has good repeatability, it suggests that large-scale production of protein crystals can be effectively achieved by manipulating cooling rates...|$|E
40|$|Protein <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiments</b> in reduced gravity environments {{have been}} {{conducted}} {{in a variety of}} set-ups. Here we are summarising the results of assays that were conducted with the Advanced Protein Crystallisation Facility (APCF) during six space missions that took place over more than a decade. We recall that the design of this facility is such that control experiments within APCF crystallisation cells can be run in parallel on earth. At first, we will shortly present the contribution of the APCF investigations to the physics of protein crystal growtha. The main goal, however, will be the critical analysis of the data from the viewpoint of crystal quality and structural biology. Doing so, we aim to bring an answer to the two following questions. (i) Is the quality of the crystals grown in reduced gravity superior to that of controls prepared on earth under otherwise identical conditions? (ii) Can more accurate three-dimensional structures be derived from the crystallographic analysis of space-grown crystals? Statistic analysis of the data strongly support the fact that microgravity has a positive effect on crystallisation and on crystal quality (about 52 % of the crystals prepared in space diffracted X-rays to a higher resolution than any ground control crystal). Attempts to correlate the effect of microgravity with other physical chemical parameters remained unsuccessful. For instance, no apparent correlation could be established between the probability of success for microgravity and any system-dependent property such as the isoelectric point of the protein or the solvent content of the crystal. On the contrary, an anti-correlation was found with the protein molecular size. So far, the structure of 12 proteins crystallised in APCF has been determined at previously unachieved resolution. Practical implications for structural determination are emphasised and physical chemical theories explaining the effect of microgravity will be presented. Finally, recommendations are given for improving the performance of protein <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiments</b> in microgravity and on earth.

40|$|A new {{cause of}} {{molecular}} dissymmetry {{was discovered in}} 1934 by Lesslie and Turner who showed that 10 -methylphenox-arsine- 2 -carboxylic acid (I) could exist in stable dextro and laevo forms. The dissymmetry was ascribed to the folding of the molecule about the oxygen-arsenic axis, but an alternative explanation was that compound (I) contained the first known example of an asymmetric tervalent arsenic atom. If {{the cause of the}} activity in (I) is due to the folding of the molecule, {{it should be possible to}} detect similar activity in a number of other types.

The optical properties of the cinchonidiner 1 - and d-a-phenylethylamine and brucine salts were examined and the latter gave some indication that the acid is a racemate.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{thermograms}} of many 66 nylon samples contain two million endotherms. White originally reported this phenomenom for drawn fibres. It has now been observed with precipitated and annealed 66 nylon and with other suitably annealed crystalline polymers. The new endotherm always appeared at a lower temperature than the original single melting endotherm of the untreated ploymer. On annealing, the development of the new endotherm was usually dependent on both the time and temperature of annealing. With 66 nylon, as the annealing time at a given temperature increased, the area of the new endotherm increased slightly. Prolonged annealing at 242 degrees C resulted in a single melting endotherm at a temperature lower than that of the unnaealed polymer. Subsequent quantative annealing experiments confirmed these observations. The crystallisation of molten 66 nylon at 242 degrees C produced polymer with two melting endotherms. These were shown to have resulted from an annealing process, rather than the primary <b>crystallisation.</b> Further <b>experiments</b> on annealed 66 nylon, including quantitative and X-ray diffraction measurements showed that changes in the polymer occurred during annealing.

In the presence of polymerised silica, less dense aggregates of finer mean particle size are formed, which has negative implications for dewatering.

40|$|AbstractFsrC is the membrane-bound {{histidine}} kinase {{component of}} the Fsr two-component signal transduction system involved in quorum sensing in the hospital-acquired infection agent Enterococcus faecalis. Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy was used here to study the intact purified protein solubilised in detergent micelles. Conditions required for FsrC stability in detergent were firstly determined and tested by prolonged exposure of stabilised protein to far-ultraviolet radiation. Using stabilised purified protein, far-ultraviolet synchrotron radiation circular dichroism revealed that FsrC is 61 % α-helical {{and that it is}} relatively thermostable, retaining at least 57 % secondary structural integrity at 90 °C in {{the presence or absence of}} gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone (GBAP). Whilst binding of the quorum pheromone ligand GBAP did not significantly affect FsrC secondary structure, near-ultraviolet spectra revealed that the tertiary structure in the regions of the Tyr and Trp residues was significantly affected. Titration experiments revealed a calculated kd value of 2 μM indicative of relatively loose binding of gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone to FsrC. Although use of synchrotron radiation circular dichroism has been applied to membrane proteins previously, to our knowledge this is the first report of its use to determine a kd value for an intact membrane protein. Based on our findings, we suggest that synchrotron radiation circular dichroism will be a valuable technique for characterising ligand binding by other membrane sensor kinases and indeed other membrane proteins in general.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis was carried out {{as part of the}} EPSRC National Centre in Continuous Manufacturing and Crystallisation (CMAC), whose vision is to accelerate the adoption of continuous manufacturing processes for the production of high-value chemical products. Results focus upon the crystallisation of multi-component molecular complexes (MMCs), in particular co-crystals, an important class of potential functional molecular materials. MMCs are commonly discovered through small scale batch solvent evaporation, a method that provides little control over the crystallisation process, often yields only small quantities of crystalline material which may not be phase pure and is not generally scalable. Methods have been developed to help translate traditional small scale batch co-crystallisation of MMCs to selective continuous co-crystallisation processes. The co-crystal system urea-barbituric acid (UBA) has three polymorphs, previously identified in the literature and was selected as a candidate for transfer to continuous crystallisation as its polymorphism offers a development challenge in being able to achieve selectivity of solid products through by various crystallisation processes. Chapter 4 describes small scale crystallisation studies of UBA using evaporation, cooling and mechano-crystallisation techniques, demonstrating that UBAI is the more prevalent polymorph. Solid state and solubility analysis of the isolated UBA polymorphs are detailed; these data provide information on the energetic relationship between the polymorphs highlighting the similarity in energy of UBAI and UBAIII, and the metastable nature of elusive UBAII. In addition the polymorphic nature of the barbituric acid starting material has been investigated with samples from different suppliers proving to consist of different polymorphs. As well as being important in designing subsequent crystallisation processes, results from these studies corroborate work previously reported in the literature Chapter 5 describes how these results have been used in development of continuous <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiments</b> using Mixed-Suspension Mixed-Product Removal (MSMPR) with a cascade of three stirred tank reactors, while Chapter 6 investigates flow crystallisation of UBA using the Continuous Oscillatory Baffled Crystalliser (COBC) and the Kinetically Regulated Automated Input tubular flow Crystalliser (KRAIC).

Here we present three novel applications of this approach. In double labelled de novo synthesized peptides the distance and relative orientation of the spin-labels was determined. Analysis of the orientation was possible by using spin-labels fixed to the protein backbone. Thereby the secondary structure could be determined, especially different helix types (alpha-, 3 10 -, pi-helix) could be distinguished, which are formed depending on the solvent environment. 5 '-Nucleotidase is an enzyme with two subunits which are supposed to rotate against each other in the catalytic process. From x-ray crystallography the structure of the individual subunits is known, their relative orientation however depends on the <b>crystallisation</b> conditions. EPR <b>experiments</b> revealed the conformation of the enzyme in solution without and with substrate and could demonstrate conformational changes upon binding of the substrate. By pulsed ELDOR experiments the dipolar coupling between a [3 Fe- 4 S] + cluster and a [NiFe] center was determined. The experimental dipolar spin-spin interaction deviates from the value expected for two point-dipoles located at the centers of the metal clusters which distance is known from x-ray crystallography. An extended spin-coupling model accounting for the spin coupling within the [3 Fe- 4 S] + cluster yields the observed coupling under the assumption of a particular magnetic coupling scheme for the three Fe ions. These results demonstrate that pulsed ELDOR can be used to gain insight into the inner structure of a multi-nuclear metal cluster...|$|R

In the dacite- H 2 O system at 1000 MPa, magnetite and either clinopyroxene or amphibole are the liquidus phases. No garnet is observed at this pressure. Dacite-mantle interaction at 920 MPa produces massive orthopyroxene crystallisation, in addition to amphibole ± phologopite. Amphibole crystallising in dacite at 1000 MPa faithfully reproduces aluminium-rich hornblende preserved in the cores of amphibole phenocrysts of the 1991 dacite, suggesting a high pressure stage of dacite crystallisation under high melt H 2 O contents (> 10 wt%) and low temperatures (< 950 C). Altogether, plagioclase, amphibole and melt inclusion compositions suggest that the Pinatubo dacite was water-rich, oxidized and not much hotter than 900 C, when emplaced in the shallow reservoir, in which most phenocrysts precipitated until {{the onset of the}} 1991 eruptions. The strongly fractionated REE pattern demands garnet somewhere during dacite genesis, which in turn requires high pressure derivation. Partial melting of subducted oceanic crust gives melts unlike the Pinatubo dacite. Interaction of these slab melts with sub-arc peridotite is unable to produce such type of dacite, nor is a direct mantle origin conceivable on the basis of mantle-dacite interaction experimental results. Dehydration melting of underplated basalts requires temperatures too high to match with petrological constraints and does not allow production of dacite melts having the low FeO/MgO, high H 2 O, Ni and Cr contents typical of Pinatubo-like magmas. On the face of chemical and phase equilibrium constraints, the most plausible origin of the Pinatubo dacite is via high pressure fractionation in the upper mantle of an hydrous, oxidised, primitive basalt that crystallises amphibole and garnet upon cooling, as shown by recent phase equilibrium work. Dacite melts so produced are directly expelled from the uppermost mantle or lower crust to shallow level storage reservoirs from which they erupt occasionally, following injection of H 2 O-poor mantle-derived basalts that can ascent without massive crystallisation unlike their hydrous counterparts, parental to dacite magmas, that rest at mantle depths. Dacites such as the Pinatubo one may thus witness particular H 2 O-rich conditions of the sub-arc mantle rather than the melting of a young and hot subducting oceanic plate...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research presented in this thesis were: (1) optimise the processing conditions {{for the production of}} water-in-cocoa butter emulsions; (2) understand the role of water droplets on the large deformation behaviour and crystallisation properties of emulsified systems. Results showed that a scraped surface heat exchanger could be used to produce tempered emulsions with a small average droplet size (3 µm). In all systems stability was provided by the emulsifier and fat crystals forming a network both in the bulk and at the interface of the water droplets. Characterisation of the large deformation properties of emulsions showed that the elastic behaviour remained constant at low aqueous phase percentages while the strength at fracture decreased. This result suggests that water droplets act as stress-concentrator elements, which is probably due to their partial sintering with the bulk network. Results of <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiments</b> have shown that the effect of droplets on kinetics of crystallisation depends on the degree of supercooling: only at relatively high temperatures (15, 20 °C) the dispersed droplets increased the kinetics of crystallisation compared to bulk cocoa butter (CB).

The morphology {{and extent of}} dispersion of ibuprofen and layered silicate was studied {{using a combination of}} wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Exhaustive examination across the length scales revealed the composite to have both an intercalated and exfoliated morphology. The ibuprofen was well dispersed and distributed throughout the PCL matrix. Most significantly, the static tensile and dynamic mechanical properties of PCL can be manipulated as a function of nanoclay loading and is dependent on the aspect ratio of clay platelets. The glass transition of PCL increased by up to 16 A degrees C on addition of nanoclay, as determined from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). This behaviour was attributed to the constrained mobility of PCL chains intercalated between clay platelets and to the tethering of PCL chains by hydrogen bonding with platelet edges. As a consequence, PCL crystallisation was inhibited and confirmed from non-isothermal <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiments</b> using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The fraction of PCL that was crystalline (X-c) decreased by 15 % on addition of ibuprofen and nanoclay, although the temperature of crystallisation (T-c) did not change significantly.

40|$|This {{study of}} Ferrar magmatic rocks from {{northern}} Victorialand and George V Land, Antarctica, is directed towards {{a better understanding}} of the petrogenesis of the two compositionally distinct magma series present within the Mid-Jurassic Ferrar Large Igneous Province: a low-Ti series (LTS: TiO 2 ~ 0. 4 – 1. 2 wt%) and a high-Ti series (HTS: TiO 2 ~ 1. 7 – 2. 1 wt%). On the basis of their mineral and whole-rock chemical compositions (including rare earth elements and platinum-group elements) the differentiation history, the melt generation and magma source characteristics are evaluated. For both magma series, an identical primary magma is deduced that has been generated by high-degree partial melting of a single, refractory subcontinental lithospheric magma source. A polybaric differentiation model is developed suggesting that the two magma series experienced pre-emplacement differentiation within independent temporary magma reservoirs at different crustal depths and hence under different prevailing conditions. Based on this model, the influence of changing redox conditions and water activities on the Ferrar magma evolution is examined by equilibrium <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiments</b> performed in internally heated pressure vessels.

40|$|Scale {{formation}} {{is one of}} the persistent problems in mineral processing and related industries. One of the main components of the scale is frequently gypsum or calcium sulphate dihydrate (= CaS 04. 2 H 20). Gypsum is formed through the process of crystallisation, and {{it is well known that}} crystallisation process is significantly affected by the presence of admixtures. Industrially, scale formation occurs in an environment which is very rarely free from the presence of admixtures. In a typical mineral processing industry, certain types of admixtures are present, which may include metallic ions (e. g. originated from corrosion products) and certain types of the flotation agents used. The effect of admixtures on crystallisation kinetics and cyclical morphology can be very significant, even if they are present in trace amounts. It is important to emphasise that the effects are generally specific, that there is no unified theory that applies to all and every situation. The present study has investigated the effect of certain admixtures on gypsum crystallisation, and was accomplished in three phases of experiments: (1) seeded batch crystallisation; (2) seeded continuous crystallisation, and (3) once through flow system under isothermal condition. The three phases of the work used equimolar solutions of CaC 12 and Na 2 SO 4 to produce CaS 04 which is the precipitating species. The seeded batch <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiment</b> explored the effect of two flotation agents commonly used in mineral processing plants: (1) sodium isopropyl xanthate (= SIPX) and, (2) isopropyl thionocarbamate. The experiments were performed at 25, 35, and 45 °C, respectively. The initial concentration of the crystallising solution was 2, 000 ppm of Ca 21 and it reached the equilibrium concentration values of between 1, 000 and 8, 00 ppm of Ca 2 + in 90 minutes. The effect of the two selected admixtures on crystallisation was measured by continuous monitoring of the desupersaturation of the crystallising solution with time, which subsequently resulted in the determination of the crystallisation rate constant. The results arc as follows. Firstly, the admixtures selected (either individually or in combination) were able to retard the growth rate of gypsum. In the absence of any admixture, the second order rate constant was between 1, 405 x 10 - 6 and 1, 561 x 10 - 6 ppm- 1 min- 1. Addition of SIPX at a typical plant dosing level 0. 200 g/L) reduced the rate constant to 475 x 10 - 6 PPM- 1 min', while isopropyl thionocarbamate at a typical plant dosing level (= 0. 070 g/L) decreased the rate constant to 254 x 10 - 6 ppm- 1 min-'. However, addition of a combination of the two admixtures, each at a typical plant concentration level, reduced the rate constant to 244 x 10 - 6 ppm- 1 min- 1, which was only slightly below that in the presence of isopropyl thionocarbamate. Thus, in these batch crystallisation studies, isopropyl thionocarbamate seemed to be dominant over SIPX. Secondly, the batch crystallisation system in the current work did not show any induction time. It was concluded that the seeds added into the batch system could be capable of eliminating the induction time. Thirdly, the reduced growth rate of the gypsum crystals as affected by the admixtures was probably caused by the adsorption of admixtures onto the crystal surface. The second phase of the project involved a seeded continuous (MSMPR) crystalliser. Some parameters used in this experiment (mean residence time, agitation speed and type of one admixture) were taken from the batch experiment carried out in the first phase of the project. Three admixtures were chosen for the seeded continuous crystallisation: (1) SIPX, (2) Fe 3 +, (3) Zn 2 -, and they were used either individually on in combination with each other. SIPX was chosen as it {{is one of the}} most common flotation agents used in mineral processing. Metallic ions: Fe 3 + and Zn 2 + were selected, since they were found in substantial amounts in both scale samples and process water in certain minerals processing industries. In general, the admixtures tested were found to be able to inhibit the crystal growth rates, but to enhance the nucleation rates. In addition, the growth rate was found to be dependent on crystal size, and hence, a correlation between these two parameters and the admixture concentration was formulated. For a fixed level of concentration (f 700 ppm of Ca z+ at steady state) and crystal surface area, it was proved that for each crystallisation temperature: 25 and 40 °C, the correlation function can be represented as G = k Lα (1 +C) β where: G = linear growth rate, micron/hour; k, α, and β = dimensionless constants; L = (sphere equivalent) crystal size, micron; C = concentration of the admixtures used, ppm. For both the crystallisation temperatures used, the correlation function shows that the growth rate is significantly dependent on crystal size, but a weak function of admixture concentrations. The mechanism of crystal growth inhibition was assumed to be that of adsorption of admixtures onto the active growth sites, thereby decreasing or stopping the growth. Similar to the first phase of the present study, this seeded continuous crystallisation also showed no induction time. The third phase of the project investigated the gypsum scale formation in a oncethrough pipe flow system under isothermal condition and in the presence of admixtures. Four types of pipe materials were tested: PVC, brass, copper and stainless steel. Two admixtures were selected: SIPX and Fe 3 +. The behaviour of the gypsum scale formation was measured as the mass of the gypsum scale deposited on the substrate per unit area of the pipe surface. Within the range of the experimental conditions applied in this scale formation study, the following results were obtained. Firstly, the mass of the gypsum scale increased with concentration (in the range: 2, 000 to 6, 000 ppm of Ca t+) and that the correlation between the mass and the concentration can be represented by quadratic functions. Secondly, the mass of the gypsum scale decreased with increasing concentration of the admixtures used. Thirdly, the flow rate of the scaling solutions (in the range: 0. 4 to 1. 3 cm/sec) did not significantly affect the mass of the gypsum scale. PVC produced the highest mass of gypsum scale, followed by brass, copper, and stainless steel, respectively. Fourthly, the presence of admixtures caused the surface of the scale deposit to become rougher than was the case in a pure system, and longer scaling experimental times resulted in denser scale deposits. In this scale formation project, the induction time was investigated. In contrast with the first and the second phase of the projects, the induction time in the scale gypsum formation experiment was significant. At a concentration of 2, 000 ppm of Ca 2 +' pure gypsum solutions had induction times of about 105 minutes at 18. 3 °C and 97 minutes at 20. 3 °C. In the presence of 10 ppm of SIPX, the scaling solution at 2, 000 ppm of Ca 2 + and 19. 2 °C had an induction time of 1, 400 minutes. The present study produced three important findings. Firstly, the presence of Fe 3 + or sodium isopropyl xanthate (SIPX) reduced the growth rate of gypsum crystallised either in a vessel (= a continuous crystalliser) or in a pipe flow system. Secondly, the rate of growth of gypsum crystals was found to be consistently higher in the vessel than in the pipe flow system. The rate of growth of the pure gypsum in the crystalliser at 25 °C was 0. 0389 kg/ m 2 hour while those in the pipe flow system were between 0. 0289 and 0. 0202 kg/m 2 hour, depending on the pipe material and the scaling solution flow rate. Thirdly, with respect to gypsum scaling, PVC was the least favourable material, followed by brass and copper, while the most favourable was stainless steel. It is believed that the present study has significantly contributed to the understanding of the effect of admixtures on crystallisation of gypsum, especially in relation to the scale formation...|$|R
40|$|Polymorphism {{presents}} {{complex issues}} for the pharmaceutical industry from processing, regulatory, patenting and stability perspectives. It can be further challenging to control the same form throughout processing and development when it {{has the capacity to}} form a hydrate. Incorporation of water into the crystal lattice contributes to significant differences in solubility, stability and bioavailability of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). During processing and formulating steps, water is used in many procedures such as, recrystallisation, wet granulation, aqueous coating lyophilisation etc. This can trigger anhydrous to hydrate conversion and could be detrimental for bioavailability and stability of the product. The factors responsible for this type of transition such as, role of solvent, activity of solvent, thermodynamic stability of different forms, equilibrium conditions, processing induced transformations are investigated. Theophylline, a channel hydrate, is chosen as a model compound which exhibits both polymorphs and solvates. The value of water activity at which the theophylline monohydrate is thermodynamically stable form was investigated using solubility, cooling <b>crystallisation</b> and slurry <b>experiments</b> and found to be aw 2 : 0. 70 at 25 QC. Full characterisation of the solid state chemistry of theophylline has resulted in the discovery of a new, previously unreported, anhydrous form of theophylline, called Form IV. Using solubility, crystallisation, slurrying and thermal experiments, Form IV was found to be thermodynamically more stable than the currently known stable form, Form H. The crystal structure of Form IV and Form I was determined by single crystal :X-Ray diffraction technique. The crystal structures for Form IV and Form I are deposited in Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) with reference code BAPLOT 03 and BAPLOT 04 respectively. The experimentally observed stability behaviour was correlated with the structural features of solid forms and also with the energy calculations. The kinetic ally stable Form H serves as the intermediate for polymorphic and hydrate-anhydrate transformations as the catemer motif observed in Form II can easily propagate by forming a strong and directional hydrogen bonds. In contrast, the dimer of theophylline molecules as observed in Form IV needs the presence of solvent to link through other dimers only by weak interactions. This results in the generation of Form IV only via solvent mediated transformations. Solid state chemistry of hydrate forming compounds Theophylline has also been used here as a model compound to study eo crystallisation with various saturated, dicarboxylic acids. A new, eo crystal of theophylline with adipic acid was generated and using thermal methods and PXRD, the stoichiometry (1 : 2, adipic acid: theophylline) is confirmed. The complex hydration-dehydration behaviour of theophylline was investigated. The samples subjected to different pharmaceutical processing conditions for hydration-dehydration, generated various. intermediate phases suggesting multiple dehydration mechanisms and the potential of phase transformations during processing of such kind of hydrate forming compounds. The sensitivity of thermal methods over other bulk methods such as PXRD, in detecting a small amount of phase impurity, has been highlighted.

The GE characteristics indicate that the components are derived from the masonry itself and not from the atmosphere. The GE genesis and mechanism, and specifically the gypsum crystallisation behaviour in porous materials, are poorly understood. We have designed and executed a series of <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiments,</b> to compare gypsum behaviour with common efflorescing salts: NaCl and Na 2 SO 4. Our experimental wick test setup consists of a brick sample mounted in a cell. The salt solution is supplied to the bottom sample side while the drying process exclusively occurs at the top. The experiments are carried out under three drying regimes: ‘accelerated’ (35 °C, 19 % RH), ‘laboratory’ (24 °C, 58 % RH) and ‘cold’ (12 °C, 80 % RH). The first simulates accelerated efflorescence formation, the second is comparable to common wick tests while the third and last imitates early spring conditions. The experiments demonstrated that gypsum accumulates below the surface, unlike natural GE occurrences. Since the basic wick test does not simulate frequent masonry wetting, we have implemented wetting cycles which resulted in a considerable GE formation. We conclude that gypsum intrinsically has a subflorescing tendency, but frequent surface wetting progressively leads to GE formation. status: publishe...|$|E

The precise physics involved in this phenomenon still remains unclear, and various mechanisms involving the action of inertial cavitation bubbles have been proposed. In this paper, two of these mechanisms, pressure and segregation effects, are examined. The first one concerns the variations of supersaturation induced by the high pressures appearing in the neighbourhood of a collapsing bubble, and the second one results from the modification of clusters distribution {{in the vicinity of}} bubble. <b>Crystallisation</b> <b>experiments</b> were performed on zinc sulphate heptahydrate ZnSO 4 center dot 7 H(2) O, which has been chosen for its pressure‐independent solubility, so that pressure variations have no effect on supersaturation.

The interfacial energy between the solid and the solution was estimated from induction times obtained in silent conditions, and, using classical nucleation theory, the steady‐state distribution of the clusters was calculated. Segregation theory was then applied to calculate the over‐concentrations of n‐sized clusters {{at the end of the}} collapse of a 41 mu m bubble driven at 20 kHz by different acoustic pressures.

Folate is a dietary requirement for man and animals. However bacteria, parasites and plants can synthesize folate de novo using enzymes of the folate biosynthesis pathway. Thus folate biosynthesis remains a key target for antimicrobial therapy as exemplified by the sulfa drugs that {{date back to the}} 1940 s, acting on the enzyme DHPS. HPPK, like other enzymes of the folate biosynthesis pathway, is absent in man and therefore is a potential drug target for the development of antimicrobial agents. Increasing rates of drug resistance to current antibiotics is a serious problem, due to the rapid adaptation of microorganisms to our chemical interventions. Because HPPK is not the target of any existing antibiotic, it is attractive for the development of new antibiotics against resistant strains. The dearth of substrate-site inhibitors for HPPK observed in the literature reflects a combination of difficult pterin-like chemistry and a paucity of commercially available pterin-like molecules, compounded by a highly specific substrate site.

Several putative members of this family were selected as potential targets for research {{with the intent of}} removing difficult targets as problems arose. Of particular interest was the smallest target, MmCDF 3, from Maricaulis maris, due to having no apparent C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, yet seemingly maintaining the tetrahedral zinc-coordinating active site and six transmembrane helices found in all known CDFs. This study focused on the expression, purification, characterisation and crystallisation of members of the CDF family, specifically targets from M. maris. High level expression (6 - 7 mg/L) and purity has been obtained for the MmCDF 1 and MmCDF 3 proteins, although both could only be obtained in a heavily aggregated state when purified in DDM. Acquiring CDF proteins in a non-aggregated stable form was necessary for repeatable <b>crystallisation</b> <b>experiments</b> and was accomplished by means of a detergent exchange in the presence of high salt concentrations. MmCDF 3 was determined to be stable after an exchange with the detergent FC 12, but only into a mixed micelle consisting of both FC 12 and DDM. Investigations into the exact nature of the micelle containing stable MmCDF 3 were performed by constructing mixed micelles of specific detergent ratios. Determination of function was performed by isothermal titration calorimetry, which showed that MmCDF 3 was capable of binding zinc and cadmium ions, although in a much reduced fashion to the larger CDF proteins. This study did highlight a potential mechanism through which MmCDF 3 and other smaller CDFs might bind their substrate ions in the cytoplasm.
