This <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> surprise to the Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E

But her mother, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, was only 17; three years later she did bear Frederick a son, the future Christian IV of Denmark.|$|E
5|$|August 28, 1991 — Hurricane Bob comes {{within a}} short {{distance}} of making landfall on the eastern tip of Long Island as a category2 hurricane. Heavy rainfall up to 7inches (175mm) and high wind gusts causes two deaths and $75million (1991USD, $117million 2007USD), as well as severe beach erosion which <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of storm surge up to 6feet (2m) above average.|$|E

5|$|By November 1944, Strong was {{reporting}} {{that there was}} a possibility of a German counteroffensive in the Ardennes or the Vosges. Smith sent Strong to personally warn Bradley, who was preparing an offensive of his own.

5|$|One of {{the most}} visible Hispanic {{legacies}} is the prevalence of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos; a Spanish name and surname, however, does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry.

5|$|Although born in England, Boucaud qualifies to {{play for}} Trinidad and Tobago through his parents, with his father born in Port of Spain and his mother born in Princes Town. Aged 19, his {{international}} debut <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 61st-minute substitute in a 2–0 friendly victory over Iraq at the Hawthorns on 23 May 2004. A week later, he played in a 4–1 away defeat against Scotland on 30 May 2004, in which he forced goalkeeper Craig Gordon into making a save from a powerful shot. His first start for Trinidad was in a 3–0 home defeat to Northern Ireland on 6 June 2004. He played in three 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers for Trinidad, playing against Saint Kitts and Nevis once and Mexico twice.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} {{problem to}} face the empire <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the involvement of Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) in Persian politics when he intervened in a succession dispute.

In 628 the empire secured a peace treaty and recovered all of its lost territories.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{declared}} victory. On {{a tactical}} level, the battle went in Israel's favor, and {{the aim of}} destroying the Karameh camp was achieved. On the other hand, the relatively high casualties sustained <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> considerable surprise for the Israelis. Israel failed to retrieve three dead soldiers, who were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks—later paraded in Amman by the Jordanians. The engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian fighters. Although the Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties, King Hussein allowed them to take credit.|$|E

5|$|By the 16th century, the priory was in decline, but its closure <b>came</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{result of}} the {{dissolution}} of the monasteries in England and Wales under Henry VIII. To help speed the process of closing the institution, Ralf Hartley was appointed as the prior of Wetheral by Henry's minister, Thomas Cromwell; royal commissioners visited in 1536, and the priory was finally surrendered to the Crown in 1538. The priory's belongings were sold off or taken by Henry, depending on their value, but the lands were given to Carlisle Cathedral. Although the rest of the priory soon fell into disrepair, the gatehouse became the local vicarage; it was still intact and in use by the minister in 1687.|$|E
