5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} his return from Italy, Etty had a very limited social life. In a typical day he would wake at 7am, paint from around 9 or 10am until 4pm, after which {{he would have a}} meal. Following the meal he would take a walk, and attend life classes between 6 and 8pm. On returning home he would drink two <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea,</b> and go to bed at midnight.|$|E
5|$|A free buffet for {{servicemen}} {{was provided}} {{at the station}} during both World Wars. The Preston Station Free Buffet Association served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 {{hours a day for}} the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3million men between 1915 and 1919. 12million <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> were served between 1939 and 1945. It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north-south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet in the waiting room on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of the televised Preston Passion of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).|$|E

5000|$|When {{cardinal}} utility is used, {{the magnitude}} of utility differences is treated as an ethically or behaviorally significant quantity. For example, suppose a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> orange juice has utility of 120 utils, a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> has a utility of 80 utils, and a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> water has a utility of 40 utils. With cardinal utility, {{it can be concluded}} that the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> orange juice is better than the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> by exactly the same amount by which the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> is better than the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> water. One cannot conclude, however, that the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> is two thirds as good as the <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> juice, because this conclusion would depend not only on magnitudes of utility differences, but also on the [...] "zero" [...] of utility. For example, if the [...] "zero" [...] of utility was located at -40, then a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> orange juice would be 160 utils more than zero, a <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> 120 utils more than zero.|$|R

25|$|A {{diet that}} {{includes}} {{large amounts of}} carotene, fiber, and vitamins with low amounts of fat—specifically, a diet with non-starchy vegetables (e.g. broccoli and onions)—may be protective, though research is still ongoing in this area. Higher caffeine intake and consumption {{of more than two}} <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> a day have both been associated with lower ovarian cancer risk. Smoking tobacco is protective for sex cord-stromal tumors.|$|E

25|$|Daily {{consumption}} of green tea is {{significantly correlated with}} a lower risk of death from any cause; an increase of one cup of green tea per day is linked with a 4% lower risk of death from any cause. A separate analysis found that an increase of three <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> or green tea per day {{was associated with a}} lower risk of total mortality in Asians and women.|$|E
25|$|Doses of {{caffeine}} {{equivalent to the}} amount normally found in standard servings of tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks appear to have no diuretic action. However, acute ingestion {{of caffeine}} in large doses (at least 250–300mg, equivalent to the amount found in 2–3 cups of coffee or 5–8 <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea)</b> results in a short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals who have been deprived of caffeine {{for a period of}} days or weeks. This increase is due to both a diuresis (increase in water excretion) and a natriuresis (increase in saline excretion); it is mediated via proximal tubular adenosine receptor blockade. The acute increase in urinary output may increase the risk of dehydration. However, chronic users of caffeine develop a tolerance to this effect, and experience no increase in urinary output.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 2012, John McAreavey {{said he was}} handcuffed {{by police}} {{officers}} and they examined his body for marks. He also {{saw one of the}} accused (Avinash Treebhoowoon) on two occasions within a number of minutes the day his wife died. McAreavey said that he had gone back to the hotel room looking for his wife when she failed to return to the restaurant after leaving him to get some biscuits from their room to eat with their <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea.</b> He found her unconscious in the bath, with the tap running and laid her on the floor and then tried to revive her. The DNA test made by a forensic expert from England revealed that no DNA traces of the two men accused and the other two original suspects were found on Michaela McAreavey body and at the crime scene except the DNA of John McAreavey.|$|E

25|$|An {{interesting}} park-like popular {{location is}} Eynali, a mountain at the north-east extremity of the city. Eynali was a barren mountain {{on top of}} which {{there was a huge}} white rectangular antenna facing Tabriz city. The old building was claimed to be a shrine that housed the burial site of an Imamzadeh (a descendant of the profit of Islam). In recent years trees have been planted on mountain slopes and the place has the appearance of a vast park. Every Friday morning many walk the site to enjoy the relatively cleaner breezes and watch the ever-growing jungle of high-rise buildings on the flat, arid plateau. Generally, the brief picnic ends with drinking a few <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> that has been brewed on a smoking fire. Making fire is a challenge as the scanty vegetation consists of trees that have been planted in recent years and are jealously guarded behind barbed wires. However, the crowds enjoy the challenge as a pleasant part of the weekly ritual. In older times, only groups of young men would climb near the shrine. In more recent years the presence of women is noticeable.|$|E

They used to be right sods for the first few days, until they realised that everything was going to go smoothly and they could get into the routine of recording. ... Then I would find time between numerous <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea</b> and salad sandwiches and baked beans on toast to listen to the recording in the control room." ...|$|E

500|$|When the Royal Air Force {{was formed}} on 1 April 1918, {{following}} {{the merger of}} the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service, the Uxbridge site came {{under the control of}} the new service, becoming known as the RAF Central Depot, Uxbridge. The site was then split to form administratively two RAF stations: the area east of the River Pinn including Hillingdon House became RAF Hillingdon and the remainder RAF Uxbridge. Among the aircraftmen trained at Hillingdon was T. E. Lawrence ('Lawrence of Arabia'), whose book The Mint, initially censored for its frank use of four-letter words, describes his time there: [...] "Hillingdon House looked forlorn, because of its black windows, behind whose wideness the clerks lounged with their first <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea.</b> 'Jammy ,' sneered Sailor enviously." ...|$|E
500|$|With little {{practical}} {{support from}} CEMA, Imogen's organisational talents, {{according to her}} friend Ursula Vaughan Williams, [...] "developed brilliantly". According to Imogen's account, her duties included conducting local brass bands, leading hymn-singing practice ("fourteen very old women in hats sitting round {{the edge of a}} dark, empty hideous tin hut"), and organising sing-songs for evacuee children. She arranged [...] performances by professional groups, and what she termed [...] "drop-in-and-sing" [...] festivals in which anyone could join. [...] Imogen also writes of [...] "idyllic days" [...] spent over <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea,</b> discussing the hopes and dreams of would-be music makers. Her compositional activity in these years was limited by time and pressures of work, but she produced two recorder trios—the Offley and Deddington suites—and made numerous arrangements for female voices of carols and traditional songs. By the summer of 1942 the workload and concomitant bureaucracy was such that she was exhausted, and in need of a lengthy rest.|$|E

2500|$|Pinter's {{writing in}} The Dumb Waiter {{combines}} [...] "the staccato rhythms of music-hall cross-talk {{and the urban}} thriller". The dialogue between Ben and Gus, while seemingly concerned only with trivial newspaper stories, football matches and <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> <b>tea,</b> reveals their characters.

2500|$|In November 1979 The Go-Betweens {{relocated}} to London, they re-released their early material and followed with another single, [...] "I Need Two Heads", also written by Forster. It peaked at No.6 on the United Kingdom Independent Charts. The group remained in UK {{for almost a}} year but ran out of money and needed a drummer, so they returned to Brisbane. By November 1980 Lindy Morrison (ex-Xero) had joined the group on drums and backing vocals. By 1981 Forster and Morrison were also lovers, she later remembered [...] "Robert never took part in any group discussions ...

[...] In the aftermath of the 60 Minutes broadcast, Kathy Marks noted in The Independent, [...] "Visitors to her large villa in the prosperous Chapel Hill area of Brisbane invariably find her refrigerator generously stocked with food, all of it destined, she insists, for the stomach of her second husband, Jeff Ferguson, a convicted fraudster".|$|E
