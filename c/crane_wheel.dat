The wheel hub was a ductile cast iron component that had been subjected to cyclic loading during a ten-year service period.

40|$|Abstract: The risk {{of fatigue}} failure of {{elements}} working in rolling contact conditions (such as railway wheels, rolling bearings, etc.) {{is a significant}} issue with respect to safety and economy. In this case the complex and non-proportional stress state with pulsating three dimensional compression occurs. Therefore, the analysis of fatigue life of structures working in rolling contact conditions can be performed using recently proposed multiaxial high-cycle fatigue criteria. However, there is no hypothesis that could be universally accepted for calculations of fatigue strength. Furthermore, not all criteria proposed in literature for rolling contact fatigue (RCF) analysis can predict it. In the paper, the most popular criteria based on different theories are investigated in the application to RCF problem. Moreover, modification of the popular Dang Van hypothesis is proposed. The problem of free and tractive rolling contact fatigue is analysed on {{the example of a}} cylindrical <b>crane</b> <b>wheel</b> and spherical thrust roller bearing...|$|E

In order to model such phenomena, a time-history dynamic analysis with a multi-scale approach is performed. The high frequency aspect of the impacts between wheels and rails is taken into account by an explicit temporal scheme, modified to resolve impacts. An implicit temporal scheme {{is used for the}} rest of the structure. The numerical coupling between the implicit and the explicit schemes is achieved with a heterogeneous asynchronous time-integrator.

40|$|Purpose. The {{value of}} drive {{resistance}} to its movement {{is the main}} parameter at calculating the drive power of bridge crane. The value of the wheel rolling friction on the rails {{is one of the}} important parts of the resistance to movement. It is necessary to determine the dependence of static (dynamic) quantities of resistance to the bridge crane movement on a straight section of the track from the position of the bogie in the span, and explore the influence of the wheel flanges resistance for wear. Methodology. Using the analytical dependences for determining the rolling friction coefficient, that depends {{on the size of the}} half-width of the contact between the wheel and rail, the improved method for calculating the required drive power of the crane was proposed. Findings. With the proposed method of power calculation the characteristic curve of the <b>crane</b> <b>wheel</b> loads, the coefficient of rolling friction of the wheels and the crane resistance to movement from the position of the bogie on span were built. In the result of graphs analysis it was found that the engine power, obtained by the proposed method is higher than the recommended by the existing standards. The more precise formula for determining the total coefficient of sliding friction that takes into account the friction of wheel flanges on the rail is given. The characteristic curves of such coefficient of friction and the total resistance to movement of the position of the crane bogie were built. Originality. The scientists proposed an improved method of determining the required engine power of bridge crane, which takes into account the effect of rolling friction of the wheels on the rails and the bogie in the span. The improved formula for determining the coefficient of friction that takes into account the friction wheel flanges of the rail was given. The characteristic curve of this coefficient of friction and the total resistance movement of crane from the position of the crane bogie were built. Practical value. The application of the proposed method of determining the driving power of the crane allows determining its value more precisely, taking into account the impedance of the rolling friction of the wheels on the rails with a flanged on the rails. This approach enables better selection of elements of the mechanism of the bridge crane movement...|$|E

40|$|Crane {{operation}} {{results in}} {{wear and tear}} of rails and <b>crane</b> <b>wheels.</b> Renovation and efficiency of these details is therefore relevant. Modern technologies of wheels and rails restoration use surfacing or high-frequency currents treatment. Surface treatment with highly concentrated streams of energy- with a laser beam, plasma jet- is a promising direction [...] It is proposed {{to increase the efficiency}} of crane rails by means of surface plasma treatment. The modes of treatment have been chosen [...] Modelling of plasma jet thermal impact on a solid body of complex shape has been made. Plasma hardening regimes that meet the requirements of production have been defined. Structural transformation of the material in the crane rails on plasma treatment has been investigated. It has been concluded that for carbon and low alloy crane steels the plasma exposure zone is characterized by a high degree of hardened structure dispersion and higher hardness as compared to the hardness after high-frequency quenching. As this takes place phase transformations are both shift (in the upper zone of plasma influence) and fluctuation (in the lower zone of the plasma). With high-speed plasma heating granular or lamellar pearlite mainly transforms into austenite. The level of service characteristics of hardened steel, which is achieved in this case is determined by the kinetics and completeness of pearlite → austenite transformation. For carbon and low alloy rail steels plasma hardening can replace bulk hardening, hardening by high-frequency currents, or surfacing. The modes for plasma treatment which make it possible to obtain a surface layer with a certain service characteristics have been define...|$|R
40|$|<b>Crane</b> <b>wheels</b> and rails are {{subjected}} to intensive wear {{in the process of}} operation. Therefore, improvement of these components’ performance can be considered a task of high importance. A promising direction in this regard is surface treatment by highly concentrated energy flows such as laser beams or plasma jets. This thesis suggests that the use of gradient plasma surface treatment can improve the performance of crane rails. A research was conducted, according to which hardened zones were deposited on crane rails under different treatment modes. Microhardness was measured both at the surface and in depth using custom-made microsections. The article includes the results of study of plasma surface hardening effects on wear resistance of crane rails. Change of plasma surface treatment parameters (current, plasma torch movement speed, argon gas flow rate) allows for desired steel hardness and structure, while the choice of optimal location for hardened zones makes it possible to significantly improve wear resistance and crack resistance. As a result of plasma surface hardening, the fine-grained martensite structure is obtained with mainly lamellar morphology and higher hardness rate compared toinduction hardening or overlaying. Wear test of carbon steels revealed that plasma surfacing reduces abrasive wear rate compared to the irinitial state by 2 to 3 times. Enough sharp boundary between hardened and non-hardened portions has a positive effect on the performance of parts under dynamic loads, contributing to the inhibition of cracks during the transition from solid to a soft metal. For carbon and low alloy rail steels, the properties achieved by plasma surface hardening can effectively replace induction hardening or overlaying. The mode range for plasma surface treatment that allow sobtaining a surface layer with certain operating properties has been determined. </p...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. In {{structural}} engineering practice the actions imposed by {{overhead travelling cranes}} onto the supporting structure are defined as static forces amplified by dynamic coefficients and applied as pseudo-static forces without taking the interaction between crane and supporting structure into account. To investigate the validity of this approach, the forces generated at the wheels of an experimental crane are measured, as the crane traverses on the supporting structure. The interaction at the <b>wheels</b> of the <b>crane</b> is also visually recorded. These wheel load results will also be used by other researchers, to calibrate a numerical model of the experimental system. A full-scale 5 ton electric overhead travelling crane (EOTC) running on top of rails and a supporting structure, was designed and erected for research purposes. The crane has a span of 8. 3 m and wheel spacing of 4 m, which can be modified. The supporting structure consists of three simply supported mono-symmetric plate girders on each side, with a total length of 13. 8 m. This is supported by columns with a height of about 3. 5 m. This paper describes the calibration of this system for measurement purposes. A data acquisition system was implemented to capture forces, strains, deflections and accelerations at various points on the crane and the supporting structure {{as well as to}} measure the velocity of the crane. The forces at the <b>crane</b> <b>wheels</b> are measured through strain gauges on the end carriage load measuring system. The calibrated facility is used to investigate the behaviour of the crane and the supporting structure under regular and exceptional wheel loads, which are classified as follows: - Regular wheel loads occur during normal payload hoisting and lowering, longitudinal crane travel with payload and lateral crab travel with payload. - Exceptional wheel loads occur during eccentric payload hoisting (payload outside normal operational area), impact forces on end-stops, maximum hoisting of the payload, failure of a longitudinal drive mechanism of the crane, misalignment of the supporting structure and skewing of the crane. The maximum values of these experimentally determined wheel loads and the dynamic response of the system is used to help describe the behaviour of the electric overhead travelling crane and its supporting structure...|$|R

5000|$|During the Victorian era {{a number}} of factors led to large demand for cranes, {{particularly}} the number of major construction projects being undertaken and the large volumes of goods to lift in factories, railways and canals.Railways, docks, canals and construction sites used large numbers of small steam cranes, either mounted on quays or on railway wheels so they could be moved around site, usually four wheels but occasionally more for larger cranes. A number of local firms in Leeds produced quite similar designs with the jib and boiler counterbalanced around a tall column pivot. These very stable machines are often refared to as 'Leeds Type' cranes.Significant construction sites to use Booths cranes include the Tower Bridge, as this {{had a great deal of}} metal framework many cranes were required in its construction. The steam cranes used in the Tower Bridge construction have been included in scenes from the 2009 Sherlock Holmes film. One less successful project to employ Booths cranes was the Wembley Park Tower project. The Wembley Park Tower was meant to be London's rival to the Eiffel Tower in Paris but was however dogged by financial problems. In 1902 the Railway Magazine commented [...] "If the Wembley Tower Company could have raised the money as quickly as these cranes raised the girders, the growth of the tower would not have ceased so abruptly." [...] A less glamorous project was the Northern Outfall Sewer in London however company advertising of the time mentioned that their cranes could be seen at work here.Some larger rail mounted cranes were produced for the railways for use as breakdown cranes and in the Civil Engineering departments. A particularly well known examples of these being the ten 8 <b>wheel</b> <b>cranes</b> supplied to BR's Western Region in 1958/59 as these became well known to many railway modellers as a result of the kit that was available from Airfix, Booths helped Airfix produce this model by supplying various plans to the firm. Other railway civil engineering cranes include those used to build the Lower Zambezi BridgeFrom 1898 Booths were producing electrically powered cranes. Producing the motors in house the components were also put to use in other products. Booths produced battery locomotives for mines and industry under the 'Union' brandname. and battery trucks and tractors for factories.As well as complete cranes the company produced winches and hoists which found many uses in the factories of the timeFrom 1875 onwards Booths made large numbers of overhead cranes for use in factories. The Sultan of Morocco had a Booths crane and this was put to use lifting the stills used for the production of perfumes for the palace harem. In later years as the railways declined overhead cranes became the bulk of the business and sales of rail mounted cranes declined.|$|R
