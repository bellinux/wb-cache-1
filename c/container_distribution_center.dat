The purpose of this project was to create a new system and procedure for the Patterson <b>Distribution</b> <b>Center</b> to audit shipped out <b>container</b> totes. The <b>distribution</b> <b>center’s</b> original method was slow, inefficient, and involved paper waste, considerable travel time, and several manual procedures.

40|$|Large, multi-national {{retailers}} have massive, worldwide supply chain networks which move product from a supplier {{to the end}} consumer. During the product's transit from a factory to a regional <b>distribution</b> <b>center,</b> customers may change or cancel their order, or the planned arrival date of the product at the <b>distribution</b> <b>center</b> may change. These products are packed in containers and arrive at the <b>distribution</b> <b>center</b> daily. Each day, humans may make decisions of which containers will be received at a <b>distribution</b> <b>center</b> and there are opportunity costs associated with selecting the wrong container to receive, namely, that the <b>distribution</b> <b>center</b> will become filled with product which is not immediately needed to meet outbound demand. This thesis analyzes one method of receiving <b>containers</b> at a <b>distribution</b> <b>center</b> and the impacts it has on satisfying customers' orders. A model for a lean inventory management system and a container selection optimization model are described in it. Representative data is presented and the model is used to solve which containers should be received. Finally, {{the efficacy of the}} model and a comparison to a heuristic are discussed. by Russell G. Forthuber. Thesis: M. B.

The research concludes that rail freight can be competitive compared to road transport if a holistic approach which tackles all weaknesses of the existing services is applied.|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of what constitutes media has received little attention in Marxism and where it does, the concept is an empty abstraction. While Marxists have extensively theorized the concentration of mass media ownership, and analyzed mass media content as ideology or propaganda, critical discussions of what a medium is in the capitalist mode of production have been mostly lacking. That is to say, Marxism {{does not have a}} media ontology. Media is therefore a critical gap in Marx’s political economy. This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by asking what is a medium in the capitalist mode of production?, answering it with a valueform theory of media and a concept of “capital’s media” that takes the circulation of capital as its starting point. The dissertation goes beyond Marxism’s mass media myopia and moves the concept of media towards logistics and infrastructure. The contributions this dissertation makes are to (1) develop a theory and category of capital’s media as a phenomenon of the circulation process of capital; (2) stake out an approach to investigate media phenomenon outside of pure political economy and cultural studies approaches; and in the process (3) contribute towards a rehabilitation of Marx’s analysis of circulation. To make these contributions this dissertation relies on a theoretical framework that is primarily based on Marx’s value theory, but enriched with concepts from Canadian- German media theory (Harold A. Innis, Marshall McLuhan, Friedrich Kittler, Wolfgang Ernst, and Hartmut Winkler) and Paul Virilio’s dromology. This dissertation has two components to its methodology: an original “circulationist” reading of Marx’s political economy that is developed from the heterodox Neue Marx-Lektüre (New Marx Reading), and a set of empirical case studies that includes the shipping container and intermodal transportation, <b>distribution</b> <b>centers,</b> and point-of-sale and payment systems Positing a category of capital’s media, this dissertation concludes that nothing by its very nature is a medium but instead that things function as media when they appear in that category. More specifically, a thing, such as a <b>container</b> ship or <b>distribution</b> <b>center,</b> appears in the category of capital’s media when they function within and for the circulation process...|$|R
