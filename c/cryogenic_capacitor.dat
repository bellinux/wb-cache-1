40|$|The Electron Counting Capacitance Standard {{currently}} pursued at PTB aims {{to close}} the Quantum Metrological Triangle with a final precision of a few parts in 10 ^ 7. This paper reports the considerable progress recently achieved with {{a new generation of}} single-electron tunnelling devices. A five-junction R-pump was operated with a relative charge transfer error of five electrons in 10 ^ 7, and was used to successfully perform single-electron charging of a <b>cryogenic</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The preliminary result for the single-electron charge quantum has an uncertainty of less than two parts in 10 ^ 6 and is consistent with the value of the elementary charge.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the final results}} of the electron counting capacitance standard experiment at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) achieved {{since the publication of}} a preliminary result in 2012. All systematic uncertainty contributions were experimentally quantified and are discussed. Frequency-dependent measurements on the 1 pF <b>cryogenic</b> <b>capacitor</b> were performed using a high-precision transformer-based capacitance bridge with a relative uncertainty of 0. 03 microF/F. The results revealed a crucial problem related to the capacitor, which hampered realizing the quantum metrology triangle with an accuracy corresponding to a combined total uncertainty of better than a few parts per million and eventually caused the discontinuation of the experiment at PTB. This paper provides a conclusion on the implications for future quantum metrology triangle experiments from the latest CODATA adjustment of fundamental constants, and summarizes perspectives and outlooks on future quantum metrology triangle experiments based on topical developments in small-current metrology.

40|$|Electronics {{operated}} at cryogenic temperature {{are often}} {{developed for the}} biasing, the front-end readout and the multiplexing of cryogenic sensors. For these <b>cryogenic</b> circuits, <b>capacitors</b> are needed for AC biasing, filtering and AC coupling. Commercially available capacitors are not specified for operation at 77 K or 4 K, and some devices showed a dramatic decrease of capacitance at cryogenic temperature. Furthermore, for voltage biasing of low impedance superconducting sensors (like Transition Edge Sensors â€“ TES), {{it is very important}} to know the parasitic resistance of an AC-biasing circuit. In this case, the parasitic Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) of the capacitor used for the AC-biasing is a bottleneck of the voltage biasing. Involved in TES development and SQUID multiplexing [1], we have characterized the capacitance and the ESR values of some commercially available capacitors at 77 K and 4 K. 2...|$|R
40|$|A {{capacitance}} standard {{based on}} the definition of capacitance C = Ne/U is realized when a capacitor is charged with a known number N of electrons (e is the elementary charge) and the voltage U across the capacitor is measured. If U is measured {{by means of a}} Josephson voltage standard, C is solely determined by quantum numbers and fundamental constants. Presently, PTB is setting up this experiment using a special type of single-electron pump, the so-called r-pump, for transferring electrons one by one onto a <b>cryogenic</b> vacuum <b>capacitor</b> with the decadic capacitance C = 1 pF. We report on the progress in the setup with emphasis on the characterization of the single-electron tunneling elements. We describe the modifications of the single-electron circuit that are necessary to implement the capacitor charging experiment by using a four- or five-junction r-pump.

40|$|The POLARBEAR- 2 CosmicMicrowave Background (CMB) {{experiment}} aims {{to observe}} B-mode polarization with high sensitivity to explore gravitational lensing of CMB and inflationary gravitational waves. POLARBEAR- 2 is an upgraded experiment based on POLARBEAR- 1, which had first light in January 2012. For POLARBEAR- 2, we {{will build a}} receiver that has 7, 588 Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers coupled to two-band (95 and 150 GHz) polarization-sensitive antennas. For the large array's readout, we employ digital frequency-domain multiplexing and multiplex 32 bolometers through a single {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID). An 8 -bolometer frequency-domain multiplexing readout has been deployed on POLARBEAR- 1 experiment. Extending that architecture to 32 bolometers requires an increase in the bandwidth of the SQUID electronics to 3 MHz. To achieve this increase in bandwidth, we use Digital Active Nulling (DAN) on the digital frequency multiplexing platform. In this paper, we present requirements and improvements on parasitic inductance and resistance of <b>cryogenic</b> wiring and <b>capacitors</b> used for modulating bolometers. These components are problematic above 1 MHz. We also show that our system is able to bias a bolometer in its superconducting transition at 3 MHz...|$|R
