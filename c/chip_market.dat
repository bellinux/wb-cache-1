Intel faced a fine of up to 10% of its annual revenue, if found guilty of stifling competition. AMD subsequently launched a website promoting these allegations. In June 2008, the EU filed new charges against Intel. In May 2009, the EU found that Intel had engaged in anti-competitive practices and subsequently fined Intel €1.06billion (US$1.44billion), a record amount. Intel {{was found to have}} paid companies, including Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and NEC, to exclusively use Intel chips in their products, and therefore harmed other companies including AMD. [...] The European Commission said that Intel had deliberately acted to keep competitors out of the computer <b>chip</b> <b>market</b> and in doing so had made a [...] "serious and sustained violation of the EU's antitrust rules". [...] In addition to the fine, Intel was ordered by the Commission to immediately cease all illegal practices. [...] Intel has stated that they will appeal against the Commission's verdict. In June 2014, the General Court, which sits below the European Court of Justice, rejected the appeal.|$|E
