In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 54 foot bones referred to Gorgosaurus were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.|$|E
5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a <b>callus</b> infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of genetically modified crops.|$|E
5|$|Shell colour is variable, from golden {{yellow to}} light yellowish-brown to grey. The {{underside}} of the shell is rarely dark; more frequently it is paler than the top, or totally white. In all cases, the shell aperture is white. Mature specimens sometimes have a metallic-grey or golden-brown gloss on {{the margin of the}} outer lip and the <b>callus.</b> A zigzag network of darker lines is sometimes present {{on the outside of the}} shell. The periostracum, a layer of protein (conchiolin) that is the outermost part of the shell surface, is yellowish-brown. It is usually thick, reticulated (net-like) and fimbriated (fringed) over the suture. The corneous operculum is dark brown, and its shape is fairly typical of the family Strombidae: a slightly bent sickle, with seven to eight weak lateral serrations.|$|E
50|$|Corns and <b>calluses</b> are chunky tough {{layers of}} skin that develop {{on the foot}} to protect {{underlying}} skin from pressure and friction. Corns and <b>calluses</b> are very common and do not look pleasant. Corns and <b>calluses</b> generally need treatment only if they cause problems. For most people, the best treatment of corns and <b>calluses</b> is to eliminate the source of friction or pressure.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{ethylene}} {{and hydrogen}} peroxide (H 2 O 2) in the induction {{of the alternative}} respiratory pathway (AP) in <b>calluses</b> from wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis and ethylene-insensitive mutant etr 1 - 3 under salt stress was investigated. The capacity and {{the contribution of the}} AP to the total respiration were signifi cantly induced by 100 mM sodium chloride (NaCl) in WT <b>calluses</b> but only slightly induced in etr 1 - 3 <b>calluses.</b> Ethylene emission was enhanced in WT <b>calluses</b> under salt stress. Application of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (an ethylene precursor) further increased the AP capacity in WT <b>calluses</b> but not in etr 1 - 3 <b>calluses</b> under salt stress. Reduction of ethylene production by aminooxyacetic acid (AOA, an ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor) in WT <b>calluses</b> eliminated the NaCl-induced increase of ethylene emission and inhibited AP induction under salt stress, suggesting that ethylene is required for AP induction. H 2 O 2 enhanced ethylene production while ethylene reduced H 2 O 2 generation in WT <b>calluses</b> under salt stress. In addition, ethylene and H 2 O 2 modulated NaCl-induced alternative oxidase gene (AOX 1 a) expression and the increase in pyruvate content in WT <b>calluses.</b> Inhibition of the AP by salicylhydroxamic acid in WT <b>calluses</b> under salt stress resulted in severe cellular damage as indicated by the high content of H 2 O 2, malondialdehyde and more electrolyte leakage. Taken together, ethylene and H 2 O 2 are involved in the salt-induced increase of the AP, which {{plays an important role in}} salt tolerance in WT <b>calluses,</b> and ethylene may be acting downstream of H 2 O 2...|$|R
40|$|Yellow friable <b>calluses</b> {{of banana}} (Musa sp.) ‘Gros Michel’, AAA group were {{initiated}} from in vitro shoot buds cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) solid medium supplemented with 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) and coconut water (CW). Small spherical, compact <b>calluses</b> were formed after friable <b>calluses</b> {{were transferred to}} half-MS liquid media supplemented with 1. 5 mg/l 2, 4 -D or 1. 5 mg/l 2, 4 -D in combination with 5 % CW or without 2, 4 -D and CW. However, no shoots were produced from these media. Embryogenic <b>calluses</b> were induced followed by subculture the spherical, compact <b>calluses</b> to half-MS solid medium {{in the presence of}} thidiazuron (TDZ). These embryogenic <b>calluses</b> gave rise to shoots on MS germination medium containing 2. 0 mg/l α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and 1. 0 mg/l 6 -benzyladenine (BA).

5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a <b>callus</b> on his third finger, which he used to impart spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his finger {{would not be able to}} handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger.|$|E
5|$|Continuous zonal {{patterns}} {{can take}} the form of whitish subsutural bands (A. similis), heavy subperipheral pigmentation (A. perversus var. infraviridis), subsutural color lines (A. columellaris), broad spiral color bands (A. metabletus, A. webbi), or narrow spiral bands (A. laevus). Interrupted zonation can consist of the interruption of bands into spots in (A. maculatus); highly irregular splitting of zones (A. perversus vars. sultanus and interruptus); formation of oblique radial streaks which run parallel to (in A. inversus) or cross (in A. latestrigatus) the incremental growth lines; or almost every conceivable combination and variation of these factors. Often the pattern will change radically from the apex to the body whorl (in A. quadrasi vars.). The aperture, parietal <b>callus,</b> columella, lip, and umbilical region are variously marked with pink, brown, purple, white, or black. Haniel (1921) includes several color plates which clearly demonstrate the extent of color variation within two species of the Syndromus type. A. perversus and A. maculiferus of the subgenus Amphidromus are equally variable, whereas species such as A. inversus and A. similis are almost uniform in coloration.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the tour}} matches was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), which fielded a team {{composed}} almost entirely of Test players. In what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests, Australia fielded their full-strength team and won by an innings. The difference in Australia's team for the First Test was the omission of leg spinner Colin McCool, who had been struggling from a torn <b>callus</b> on his spinning finger, which prevented him from bowling long spells. It was thought that Bradman would play another leg spinnerDoug Ringin McCool's place, but the Australian captain changed his mind on the first morning when rain was forecast. Bill Johnston was played {{in the hope of}} exploiting a wet wicket. In previous rain-affected matches on the tour, Johnston had been highly effective, taking match figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively. Bill Brown, the reserve opener, played out of position in the middle-order, as he had against Worcestershire and the MCC. Aside from Brown and Johnston's inclusion, Australia's team was the same as that which started the previous Ashes series in 1946–47, which they won 3–0.|$|E
40|$|A {{simplified}} freezing {{process was}} developed and successfully applied to embryogenic <b>calluses</b> of three sugarcane commercial hybrids (#Saccharum$ sp. cv. CP 5243, C 91 - 301 and C 1051 - 73). To obtain optimal survival, the <b>calluses</b> were pretreated with a cryoprotective solution containing 10 % DMSO and 0. 3 to 0. 75 M sucrose. For freezing, the samples were immersed in an alcohol bath placed in a - 40 °C freezer, thus allowing a freezing rate comprised between 0. 4 and 0. 6 °C/min. Samples were held at that temperature for 2 h before immersion in liquid nitrogen. The highest survival rates of cryopreserved <b>calluses</b> ranged between 20 and 94 % depending on the variety, and fully developed plantlets could be obtained from regenerating <b>calluses.</b> Embryogenic <b>calluses</b> of one variety were stored for 14 months in liquid nitrogen without any effect on their survival rate and plantlet production.

5|$|The {{root system}} and the shoot system are interdependent – the usually non{{photosynthetic}} root system depends on the shoot system for food, and the usually photosynthetic shoot system depends on water and minerals from the root system. Cells in each system are capable of creating cells of the other and producing adventitious shoots or roots. Stolons and tubers are examples of shoots that can grow roots. Roots that spread out close to the surface, {{such as those of}} willows, can produce shoots and ultimately new plants. In the event that one of the systems is lost, the other can often regrow it. In fact it is possible to grow an entire plant from a single leaf, {{as is the case with}} Saintpaulia, or even a single cell – which can dedifferentiate into a <b>callus</b> (a mass of unspecialised cells) that can grow into a new plant.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{shape of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis {{is similar to}} that of Theodoxus transversalis. The shell shape of Theodoxus danubialis is more spherical. The shape of the {{aperture}} of Theodoxus prevostianus is usually descending. However, all of these species display a large morphological plasticity, which makes them difficult to differentiate. The overall outline of the shell is still used for species identification in recent malacological literature. Though the coloration and patterns of the shells cannot be relied upon to identify specimens, opercular characters can be used for a proper identification of Theodoxus fluviatilis. The calcified operculum of T. fluviatilis is D-shaped, light reddish with a red margin, bearing a broad rib (also called a ridge) on its inner surface. The columellar muscle is attached to the rib. The rib is long and thin, attenuated at the base, while the <b>callus</b> is thin; a peg is lacking. The characteristic features of the operculum are already visible in juveniles. There is sexual dimorphism on the border of the rib shield of the operculum, which is straight in females, but curved in males.|$|E
5|$|With Klim {{recently}} {{returning from}} a two-year injury layoff, and <b>Callus</b> ill, Thorpe could only anchor Australia to sixth in the 4×100m freestyle relay. The 200m began with van den Hoogenband again attacking immediately, reaching the 100m mark more than a second under the world record split, with Thorpe half a body length behind. Thorpe gradually reduced the lead before passing van den Hoogenband in the last 50m to win The Race of the Century by half a body length, in a new Olympic record of 1min 44.71s. Having achieved what had eluded him four years earlier, Thorpe reacted emotionally, immediately tearing off his cap, punching the air and screaming. The next day saw six years of Australian victory in the 4×200m freestyle relay ended when Hackett, Klim and Sprenger had put Thorpe into the final leg 1.48s behind Keller. Thorpe gradually reduced the margin {{but was unable to}} pass Keller in the last lap, the United States touching 0.13s earlier. Thorpe found himself {{on the other side of}} a close result when he qualified last for the 100m freestyle by 0.01s. He capitalised in the final by coming from sixth at the 50m mark to win bronze medal in a personal best of 48.56s, making him the only person to medal in the 100–200–400 combination in Olympic history. After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a break from competitive swimming, skipping the 2005 World Aquatics Championships.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe {{arrived in}} Fukuoka having been chosen by {{broadcaster}} TV Asahi as the marketing drawcard of the event. With the 4×100m freestyle relay being held after the 400m freestyle {{on the first}} night, Thorpe appeared to be conserving energy {{when he reached the}} 200m mark two seconds outside his world record. Although he was 0.93s behind at the final turn, a final 50m burst in 24.36s saw him cut a further 0.42s from his world record. The relay saw him dive in fractionally ahead of American Jason Lezak after Klim, <b>Callus</b> and Pearson had completed the first three legs. Thorpe fell behind in the early half of the leg before kicking away in the closing stages, to seal gold with his fastest-ever relay split of 47.87s. In the 800m final, he shadowed Hackett for the first 750m, staying within a body length. He then broke clear to win by a body length, lowering his world record by over two seconds. The 200m freestyle rematch with van den Hoogenband provided Thorpe with a chance to rectify his strategy from the Olympics; this time he allowed the Dutchman to lead through the first 100m. Thorpe pulled even at the 150m mark and then broke away towards the finishing wall two body lengths clear. He lowered his world record to 1min 44.06s in the process, prompting van den Hoogenband to raise his arm aloft. Thorpe's winning streak was interrupted in the 100m freestyle when his personal best of 48.81s placed him fourth, but he returned to form in the 4×200m freestyle relay. Anchoring the team of Klim, Hackett and Kirby, the Australians lowered their world record time by more than two seconds, leaving the Italians more than six seconds in arrears. Having overtaken Klim as Australia's leading 100m freestyle swimmer, Thorpe was entrusted with anchoring the 4×100m medley relay team on 28 July. After Matt Welsh, Regan Harrison and Geoff Huegill had finished their legs, Thorpe's change left him half a body length behind the new 100m world champion Anthony Ervin of the United States. The Americans were expected to win, and with his typically slow start, Thorpe turned a body length behind with 50m remaining. With an American victory seeming inevitable, Thorpe managed to accelerate and deprive Ervin of the lead in the last 5m. This made Thorpe the only swimmer to have won six gold medals at a World Championships, and the first since Shaw in 1974 to win the 200–400–800 treble. His performances formed the basis for Australia's gold medal win over the United States 13–9. It was also {{the first time since the}} 1956 Summer Olympics that Australia had topped the medal tally at a global meet. Thorpe's achievements led to predictions that he could match Mark Spitz's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics, which he played down.|$|E
