5000|$|Nissan {{introduced}} its Variable Valve Event and Lift (VVEL) in 2007 as the world's second CVVL system. The first application {{was on the}} VQ37VHR V6 engine of Skyline Coupe (Infiniti G37). Nissan's system is more compact than BMWâ€™s, involving fewer parts and less energy loss, and is therefore more adaptable to high-performance engines. [...] The VVEL does not use a conventional intake camshaft. Each valve is actuated by a cam which is pivoted on - but not fixed to - the camshaft. While conventional camshafts feature fixed rotating lobes, the cam in VVEL swings up and down; {{this is why it}} does not need a symmetric profile. Its movement is driven by the camshaft via a series of components. VVEL varies valve lift by the eccentric <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> inside the rocker arm. By rotating the eccentric <b>control</b> <b>shaft,</b> the position of rocker arm is shifted, changing the swing angle of cam. The swing angle of cam determines the degree of valve lift.|$|E

However, if shaft unbalance rises appreciably above the design value (e. g., due to a turbine blade loss), a conventional squeeze film becomes overloaded, {{and is no longer}} effective in controlling vibration amplitudes and bearing forces. A damper concept characterized by two oil films is described. Under normal conditions, only one low-clearance film is active, allowing precise location of the shaft centerline.

50|$|A {{rocker arm}} and {{two types of}} links open the intake-valves by {{transferring}} the rotational movement of a drive shaft with an eccentric cam to the output cam.The movement of the output cam is varied by rotating the <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> with a DC stepper motor and changing the fulcrums of the links. This makes the continuous adjustment {{of the amount of}} the valve's lift (e.g., the amount of intake opening), during the intake valve event in the four-stroke cycle, possible.CVTC and VVEL together control the valve phases and its valve events, allowing free-control of the valve timing and lift. This results in more efficient airflow to the cylinder, significantly improved responsiveness, optimizing the balance between power and environmental performance.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the chain}} {{is not being}} used for a high wear {{application}} (for instance if it is just transmitting motion from a hand operated lever to a <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> on a machine, or a sliding door on an oven), {{then one of the}} simpler types of chain may still be used. Conversely, where extra strength but the smooth drive of a smaller pitch is required, the chain may be [...] "siamesed"; instead of just two rows of plates on the outer sides of the chain, there may be three ("duplex"), four ("triplex"), or more rows of plates running parallel, with bushings and rollers between each adjacent pair, and the same number of rows of teeth running in parallel on the sprockets to match. Timing chains on automotive engines, for example, typically have multiple rows of plates called strands.|$|E
5000|$|The lever {{extends to}} the right from a {{vertical}} <b>control</b> <b>shaft.</b> The lever has a neutral position with the lever extended directly {{to the right of}} the pivot. Braking is applied by progressively rotating the lever clockwise, which, due to the position of the level relative to the pivot, is actuated by the operator moving their hand closer to the body - to the [...] "rear". Forward traction is added by rotating the lever counter-clockwise, or [...] "forward". As the lever translates linear motion by the operator into rotary motion of the lever, the level is normally topped with a rotating knob at the right end. This allows the operator to slide the lever without twisting their wrist. The controller often also incorporates a fail-safe device (or dead man's switch) that requires constant downward pressure once the lever is rotated forward from the neutral position. Releasing the lever causes it to pop up on a spring, activating emergency braking.|$|E

40|$|Aggressive engine downsizing, {{variable}} {{compression ratio}} {{and use of the}} Atkinson cycle are being combined to improve fuel economy by up to 40 percent relative to port fuel injected gasoline engines, while maintaining full engine power. Approach Engine downsizing is viewed by US and foreign automobile manufacturers {{as one of the best}} options for improving fuel economy. While this strategy has already demonstrated a degree of success, downsizing and fuel economy gains are currently limited. With new {{variable compression ratio}} technology however, the degree of engine downsizing and fuel economy improvement can be greatly increased. A small variable compression ratio (VCR) engine has the potential to return significantly higher vehicle fuel economy while also providing high power. Affordability and potential for near term commercialization are key attributes of the Envera VCR engine. VCR Technology To meet torque and power requirements, a smaller engine needs to do more work per stroke. This is typically accomplished by boosting the incoming charge with either a turbo or supercharger so that more energy is present in the cylinder per stroke to do the work. With current production engines the degree of engine boosting (which correlates to downsizing) is limited by detonation (combustion knock) at high boost levels. Additionally, the turbo or supercharger needs to be responsive and efficient while providing the needed boost. VCR technology eliminates the limitation of engine knock at high load levels by reducing compression ratio to {approx} 9 : 1 (or whatever level is appropriate) when high boost pressures are needed. By reducing the compression ratio during high load demand periods there is increased volume in the cylinder at top dead center (TDC) which allows more charge (or energy) to be present in the cylinder without increasing the peak pressure. Cylinder pressure is thus kept below the level at which the engine would begin to knock. When loads on the engine are low the compression ratio can be raised (to as much as 18 : 1) providing high engine efficiency. It is important to recognize that for a well designed VCR engine cylinder pressure does not need to be higher than found in current production turbocharged engines. As such, there is no need for a stronger crankcase, bearings and other load bearing parts within the VCR engine. The Envera VCR mechanism uses an eccentric carrier approach to adjust engine compression ratio. The crankshaft main bearings are mounted in this eccentric carrier or 'crankshaft cradle' and pivoting the eccentric carrier 30 degrees adjusts compression ratio from 9 : 1 to 18 : 1. The eccentric carrier is made up of a casting that provides rigid support for the main bearings, and removable upper bearing caps. Oil feed to the main bearings transits through the bearing cap fastener sockets. The eccentric carrier design was chosen for its low cost and rigid support of the main bearings. A <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> and connecting links are used to pivot the eccentric carrier. The <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> mechanism features compression ratio lock-up at minimum and maximum compression ratio settings. The <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> method of pivoting the eccentric carrier was selected due to its lock-up capability. The <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> can be rotated by a hydraulic actuator or an electric motor. The engine shown in Figures 3 and 4 has a hydraulic actuator that was developed under the current program. In-line 4 -cylinder engines are significantly less expensive than V engines because an entire cylinder head can be eliminated. The cost savings from eliminating cylinders and an entire cylinder head will notably offset the added cost of the VCR and supercharging. Replacing V 6 and V 8 engines with in-line VCR 4 -cylinder engines will provide high fuel economy at low cost. Numerous enabling technologies exist which have the potential to increase engine efficiency. The greatest efficiency gains are realized when the right combination of advanced and new technologies are packaged together to provide the greatest gains at the least cost. Aggressive engine downsizing with variable compression ratio and use of the extended Atkinson cycle can provide large fuel economy gains that are exceptionally cost effective. Analysis indicates that a 2. 2 L supercharged Envera VCR engine can match the torque of a larger V 8 engine at 2000 rpm. The VCR engine's high torque value at low engine speed is beneficial for maintaining the driving feel and responsiveness of the larger V 8 engine. The Envera VCR engine will attain high efficiency at {approx} 100 Nm primarily due to the combination of engine down-sizing and use of the Atkinson cycle. Qualitatively the fuel economy gain realized from down-sizing from a V 8 to an Atkinson-cycle I- 4 is about twice as large as the benefits from down-sizing from a V 8 to a Turbo V 6 when evaluated at 100 Nm 2000 rpm...|$|E
40|$|A {{technological}} {{break through}} for supporting rotating shafts is the {{active magnetic bearing}} (AMB). Active magnetic bearings offer some important advantages over conventional ball, roller or journal bearings such as reduced frictional drag, no physical contact in the bearing, no need for lubricants, compatibility with high vacuum and ultra-clean environments, and ability to <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> position within the bearing. The disadvantages of the AMB system are the increased cost and complexity, reduced bearing stiffness {{and the need for}} a controller. Still, there are certain applications, such as high speed machining, biomedical devices, and gyroscopes, where the additional cost of an AMB system can be justified. The inherent actuator capabilities of the AMB offer the potential for active balancing of spindles and micro-shaping capabilities for machine tools, The work presented in this paper concentrates on an AMB test program that utilizes the actuator capability to dynamically balance a spindle. In this study, an unbalanced AMB spindle system was enhanced with an LMS (Least Mean Squares) algorithm combined with an existing PID (proportional, integral, differential) control. This enhanced controller significantly improved the concentricity of an intentionally unbalanced shaft. The study included dynamic system analysis, test validation, control design and simulation, as well as experimental implementation using a digital LMS controller...|$|E

40|$|A circuit generates {{an analog}} voltage {{proportional}} to an angle, {{in response to}} two sinusoidal input voltages having magnitudes proportional to the sine and cosine of the angle, respectively. That is to say, given input voltages proportional to sin(Omega(t)) sin(Theta) and sin(Omega(t)) cos(Theta) [where Theta denotes the angle, mega denotes 2 (pi) x a carrier frequency, and t denotes time], the circuit generates a steady voltage proportional to Theta.

40|$|Drilled shafts are {{cylindrical}} deep foundations {{constructed by}} casting fluid concrete into an excavated hole. These elements rely largely on side shear resistance generated by their substantial diameters and lengths to effectively transfer loads. Therefore, an exceptional concrete to soil interface {{is essential for}} proper performance of these structures. The FDOT preferred stabilization fluid, bentonite slurry, has been proven to degrade this interface with increased exposure time due to filter cake formation. For this reason, slurry exposure time has been limited to 36 hours by FDOT. Alternately, polymer slurries do not form a filter cake but rather stabilize excavations through continuous soil infiltration and the associated cohesion that accompanies the slurry presence. As polymer slurry use is relatively new {{to the state of}} Florida, FDOT does not presently have clear specifications regarding polymer exposure time limits. Hence, this thesis presents the results of pullout tests performed on 1 / 10 th scale drilled shafts constructed with both polymer and bentonite slurries and with varying exposure times. To explore the effect of exposure time on side shear resistance, 24 - 4 in diameter 8 ft long shafts were constructed: 6 with bentonite and 18 with three different polymer products (6 each). After being exposed to the respective slurry for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 or 24 hours, each excavated hole was concreted and tested after 7 days of curing. Pullout tests served as a direct measure of side shear resistance due to the absence of base resistance associated with compression testing. After testing, shafts were exhumed and sectioned for filter cake measurement. As expected, shafts constructed using bentonite slurries immediately exhibited a decrease in capacity with increased exposure time. Between 0 and 24 hours a 34 % reduction in capacity was witnessed. These reductions were attributed to filter cake thickness which increased with exposure time along with the reduction in effective shaft. After 4 hours of exposure, side shear resistance for the bentonite shafts approached an asymptote, likely defined by the strength of the filter cake formed. The side shear resistance of all polymer shafts exceeded that of the 24 hr bentonite <b>control</b> <b>shaft</b> by 20 - 50 percent depending on the polymer product used. For a given polymer product no capacity reduction was noted with respect to time. Inspection of exhumed shafts revealed the formation of a soil cake (region of stabilized soil stuck to the shaft) {{around the perimeter of the}} polymer shafts. Therefore, the side shear resistance of the polymer shafts was defined by the soil-to-soil interface surrounding the shaft and not by an intermediate filter cake. The study resulted in the following findings: (1) open excavations using polymer slurry stabilization are not adversely affected by extended exposure time, (2) the effect of filter cake formation in bentonite supported excavations slows with time whereby no significant degradation in capacity was noted after 8 hours, (3) shafts constructed with polymer slurry performed better than those constructed with bentonite, and (4) as polymer slurry flow into the surrounding soil does not slow with time, more slurry volume is required (compared with bentonite) and slurry level must be continuously maintained...|$|E
