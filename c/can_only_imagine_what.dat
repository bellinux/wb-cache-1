He also criticized the lack of extra content, but complimented the DVD's sound. Jacobson gave the release's image, sound and extras ratings of D+, A-, D, respectively. Aaron Beriele from DVD Talk website shared Jacobson's views, saying that it was [...] "a wonderful show from Madonna and I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> it was like to actually be there. As for the DVD, it offers outstanding audio quality, but only so-so image quality. Still, it's a terrific show and the DVD still certainly gets a recommendation." ...|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} itself {{agreed that the}} private sector contributes about 90 per cent to the nation's Gross Domestic Product. With SMEs forming about 65 per cent of the private sector operations, one <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> the effects of the new move by the bank will be on the economy." [...] Banks in the country, for along time, {{had been part of the}} problem of the real sector, saying they would rather get involved in round-tripping and short-term lending for commercial activities, than to lend to businesses with manufacturing operations. It is in this light that the new twist is commendable of emulation by other banks. First, through its current GMD, has shown an unusual disposition to the plight of small scale industrialists. I think he deserves all the kudos." ...|$|E

About the ending she states that the final exchange [...] "manages to take this episode from an [...] "eh" [...] to an [...] "OH SNAP."" [...] and she comments: [...] "Did you see that coming? I must say I was thoroughly delighted by this new development. We’ve seen vampire shows where the vampire world is either very much out there (a la True Blood), or very underground. I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what’s</b> in store for this series if some sort of witch hunt goes down. A show is always more interesting when there’s more than one threat for the characters to deal with." ...|$|R

2500|$|At times, various vice Rectors of the Josephinum (the apostolic {{delegate}} to the United States was the nominal rector) would feel under the gun {{to clamp down on}} the student's access to [...] "worldly literature." [...] One such episode occurred after a visit of Bishop Joseph Mark McShea of Allentown, PA that led to a new vice Rector, Ralph Thompson, and some strict new rules, among them a [...] "book policy" [...] that limited what students could read. [...] Beyond spiritual and classroom books, students had to have a permission slip signed by a professor for any book in their college rooms. [...] One college student went to see Fick and asked him to sign a slip for John Dos Passos' trilogy [...] "USA" [...] and with great sadness Fick told him that while he was greatly pleased that this student wanted to read such a great work of American literature in three volumes, he didn't want his signature on a permission slip for such an author given the repressive atmosphere then in place at the Josephinum. [...] Fick sadly told the student to wait until summer, buy the book and read it during the vacation period. [...] Former Fick students who appreciated Fick's love of literature <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> it took out of him to thus deny a student who wanted to read a good book. [...] This experience in censorship and mild repression had a profound influence on some students who never forgot what a powerful institution can do to an individual's spirit and went on to fight various institutions throughout their lives remembering Fick's resignation to powers over which a young English teacher had little influence.|$|E

5000|$|A {{writer for}} the gay blog and news website AfterElton.com {{expressed}} his shock at the scene featuring Brendan hitting Ste and also called the story [...] "compelling". He said, [...] "I must say that even though I've been following this storyline since it began, and I knew what was coming, seeing Brendan hit Ste was quite shocking… and the storyline is just beginning. The show has said it's {{going to be a}} dark, long-running story arc so I <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what's</b> ahead. I admit that I find the storyline quite compelling, and I've been drawn into it. While some people have seen this as a romance, it's never played that way to me. Ste and Brendan's scenes do have an element of sexual allure since the actors have chemistry, but there's too much darkness and manipulation on the edges of every scene to make real romance even possible. He also gave credit to the show for its slow build up over a few months.|$|R
2500|$|Whether Nicola Pisano {{learned his}} {{appreciation}} of neo-classicism in Frederick II’s workshop {{or whether he}} picked up inspiration from the ruins of Roman sculpture that were strewn about Pisa during that time period one <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>imagine,</b> but <b>what</b> is known is that Nicola mastered the combination of Christian traditions such as the Narrative of Christ {{with the use of}} Roman and Late Antique style. With the similar pulpit in Pisa being finished in 1260 and this Siena pulpit being completed in 1268 {{it can be seen that}} Nicola embraced the Classic revival before any of those deemed “Renaissance Artists” ...|$|R
5000|$|Panel {{painting}} is very old; {{it was a}} very prestigious medium in Greece and Rome, but only very few examples of ancient panel paintings have survived. A series of 6th century BC painted tablets from Pitsa (Greece) represent the oldest surviving Greek panel paintings. Most classical Greek paintings that were famous in their day seem to have been of a size comparable to smaller modern works - perhaps up to a half-length portrait size. However, for a generation {{in the second quarter of}} the fifth-century BC there was a movement, called the [...] "new painting" [...] and led by Polygnotus, for very large painted friezes, apparently painted on wood, decorating the interiors of public buildings with very large and complicated subjects containing numerous figures at at least half life-size, and including battle scenes. We <b>can</b> <b>only</b> attempt to <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> these looked like from some detailed literary descriptions and vase-paintings that appear to echo their compositions. [...] The first century BC to third century AD Fayum mummy portraits, preserved in the exceptionally dry conditions of Egypt, provide the bulk of surviving panel painting from the Imperial Roman period - about 900 face or bust portraits survive. The Severan Tondo, also from Egypt (about 200AD) is one of the handful of non-funerary Graeco-Roman specimens to survive. Wood has always been the normal support for the Icons of Byzantine art and the later Orthodox traditions, the earliest of which (all in Saint Catherine's Monastery) date from the 5th or 6th centuries, and are the oldest panel paintings which seem to be of the highest contemporary quality. Encaustic and tempera are the two techniques used in antiquity. Encaustic largely ceased to be used after the early Byzantine icons.|$|R

The album features performances by Taylor with Archie Shepp, Buell Neidlinger, Denis Charles and Sunny Murray on alternate takes of material released on The World of Cecil Taylor (1960). The Allmusic review by Brian Olewnick states [...] "One <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>what</b> {{the reaction of}} the average jazz fan was in 1960 when this session was recorded. This is a wonderful document from early in Taylor's career, when he was midway between modernist approaches to standard material and his own radical experiments that would come to full fruition a few years hence...
