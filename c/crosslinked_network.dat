25|$|Peroxide {{crosslinking}} (PE-Xa): The crosslinking of polyethylene using peroxides (e. g. dicumyl or di-tert-butyl peroxide) {{is still}} of major importance. In the so-called Engel process, {{a mixture of}} HDPE and 2 % peroxide is at first mixed at low temperatures in an extruder and then crosslinked at high temperatures (between 200 and 250°C). The peroxide decomposes to peroxide radicals (RO•), which abstract (remove) hydrogen atoms from the polymer chain, leading to radicals. When these combine, a <b>crosslinked</b> <b>network</b> is formed. The resulting polymer network is uniform, of low tension and high flexibility, whereby it is softer and tougher than (the irradiated) PE-Xc.|$|E

The construction of free energy functionals for homogeneous weakly crosslinked IPNs and pseudo-IPNs and their spinodal curves and critical points of unmixing is described.

50|$|Invoking {{the theory}} of rubber elasticity, one {{considers}} a polymer chain in a <b>crosslinked</b> <b>network</b> as an entropic spring. When the chain is stretched, the entropy is reduced by a large margin because there are fewer conformations available. Therefore, there is a restoring force, which causes the polymer chain to return to its equilibrium or unstretched state, such as a high entropy random coil configuration, once the external force is removed. This {{is the reason why}} rubber bands return to their original state. Two common models for rubber elasticity are the freely-jointed chain model and the worm-like chain model.|$|E

Typical properties (curing behavior and mechanism, thermal stability, mechanical and dielectric properties) of the composites were systematically investigated, and their origins were discussed.

Compared with cured DBA/BDM resin, composites with suitable content of MPSA show obviously improved flexural strength and modulus as well as impact strength; in addition, all composites not only have lower dielectric constant and similar frequency dependence, more interestingly, they also exhibit better stability of frequency on dielectric loss. For thermal stability, the addition of MPSA to DBA/BDM resin significantly decreases the coefficient of thermal expansion, and improves the char yield at high temperature with a slightly reduced glass transition temperature.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the applicability of different constitutive models for silicone networks using comprehensive multiaxial experimental tests, including non-equibiaxial mechanical tests which introduce differential constraints on the networks in the two orthogonal directions, on samples prepared using various crosslinking densities. Uniaxial stress-strain experiments show that a decrease in crosslinker amounts used in the preparation of silicone networks lead to more compliant material response as compared to that obtained using higher amounts of crosslinker. Biaxial data were used to obtain fits to the neo- Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, Arruda-Boyce and the Edward-Vilgis slip-link constitutive models.

PLA and LDPE were compounded with 5 - 20 parts per hundred resins (phr) of kenaf respectively to enhance mechanical properties. The compounded kenaf added PLA/LDPE samples were electron beam irradiated from 15 to 60 kGy. The physical properties of kenaf added PLA/LDPE samples were characterized using gel content, X-Ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analysis. The {{results showed that the}} increasing of irradiation dosages in PLA/LDPE have gradually increased the gel content and tensile strength due to the formation of <b>crosslinking</b> <b>networks</b> in polymer matrix. However, the higher loading level of kenaf and irradiation dosages could decrease the elongation at break of PLA/LDPE samples.
