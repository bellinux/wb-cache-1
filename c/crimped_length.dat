This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the evaluation of the parameters of plain weave textile from Kevlar 49 fibers. They were determined following the basic parameters of the textiles e. g. <b>crimp</b> <b>length,</b> <b>crimp</b> amplitude, thickness of the woven fabric, dimensions of the cross-sectional tow (tow width, tow height) and crimp angle. The number of fibers in the warp and tow strands was also determined. The work is also concerned with the analysis of microcracks in the material, that is, microcracks that appeared after the tensile test. Microscopic observation of cracks occurred on the test specimen strip according to DIN EN ISO 14129 for tensile testing. Strips of the material were cut,the metallurgical methods used being kept perpendicular to the thickness of the test specimen. Microcracks occurred in the individual planes located in the chosen reference axis. Microcracks were detected in the entire width of the specimen. The types of microcracks were determined by the length and traits of the microcracks...|$|R
40|$|Sterilization of allografts for {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has become an important prerequisite to prevent disease transmission. However, current sterilization techniques impair the biological or mechanical properties of such treated grafts. Peracetic acid (PAA) has been successfully used to sterilize bone allografts without these disadvantages and does not impair the mechanical properties of soft tissue grafts in vitro. We asked whether PAA sterilization would influence recellularization, restoration of <b>crimp</b> <b>length</b> and pattern, and revascularization of ACL grafts during early healing. We used an in vivo sheep model for open ACL reconstruction. We also correlated the histologic findings with the restoration of anteroposterior stability and structural properties during load-to-failure testing. PAA slowed remodeling activity at 6 and 12  weeks compared to nonsterilized allografts and autografts. The mechanical properties of PAA grafts were also reduced compared to these control groups at both time points. We conclude PAA sterilization currently {{should not be used}} to sterilize soft tissue grafts typically used in ACL reconstruction...|$|R

40|$|Degenerative {{disorders}} of the {{rotator cuff}} tendons {{account for nearly}} 75 % of all shoulder pain, causing considerable pain and morbidity. Given the strong correlation between age and tendinopathy, and unprecedented population aging, these disorders will become increasingly prevalent. Improved understanding of tendon degeneration will guide the development of future diagnostic and treatments, and is therefore urgently needed. However, the aetiology and pathology of rotator cuff tendinopathy remain unclear. The complicated mechanical environment of the rotator cuff is hypothesised to influence the susceptibility of the tendons to degeneration and tearing. Studies have reported biological adaptations in torn cuff tendons indicative of increased compressive loading within the tendon. The material adaptations of healthy and degenerative cuff tendons are largely unreported but will provide further insight {{into the role of}} the mechanical environment in rotator cuff aetiology and pathology. This thesis examined the material adaptations of healthy and diseased tendons to explore the role of mechanical loading in rotator cuff pathology. The material adaptations of healthy animal tendons, and healthy and delaminated human cadaveric rotator cuff tendons, in response to different loading environments were characterised. The effects of age, tears, steroid injection and subacromial decompression surgery on the structural adaptations of human cuff tendons were also studied, as was the effect of tendon cell proliferation on the mechanical properties and degradation behaviour of collagen scaffolds. Loading environment significantly affected the structural adaptations of healthy tendons. Regions exposed to compressive and shear strains exhibited thinner fibres, shorter <b>crimp</b> <b>lengths</b> and thinner, less aligned fibrils compared with regions exposed to tensile strains alone. In healthy rotator cuff tendons, the inhomogeneous loading environment produced topographically inhomogeneous structural adaptations. The tendons of a delaminated rotator cuff exhibited less topographical variation in properties and thinner, less aligned fibrils compared with healthy cuff tendons. Torn cuff tendons exhibited thinner fibrils and shorter <b>crimp</b> <b>lengths</b> compared with control samples. These adaptations were identifiable early in the disease progression, and neither steroid injection nor subacromial decompression surgery significantly influenced these adaptations at seven weeks post-treatment. Significant correlations between decreasing dimensions and increasing tear size were found when age was included as a confounding factor, reflecting the importance of age and tear size in determining the material properties of tendons. Tendon cell proliferation influenced the mechanical properties and degradation behaviour of the collagen scaffolds, emphasising the integral role of cells in the functional adaptation of biological materials. These results demonstrate the effect of mechanical environment on the material adaptations of tendons. They also indicate the importance of the complicated mechanical environment experienced by the rotator cuff tendons in predisposing the tendons to degeneration and tearing. The observed material adaptations of degenerative and torn tendons suggest that rotator cuff pathology is associated with increased levels of compressive and/or shear strains within the tendon. These changes begin early in the disease progression and neither steroid injection nor sub-acromial decompression surgery are capable of reversing the changes in the timeframe investigated. These findings highlight the urgent clinical need for pre-rupture diagnostic techniques for the detection of early pathological changes in the rotator cuff. They also emphasize the requirement for new intervention strategies that restore the healthy mechanical environment and reverse early pathological adaptations in order to prevent catastrophic failure of the tendons.

40|$|Purpose: Collagen crimp is {{essential}} for maintaining viscoelastic properties of normal ligament and tendon tissue. The actin isoform α-smooth muscle actin (ASMA) has been identified in fibroblastic cells of these tissues. These highly differentiated cells, so called myofibroblasts may transmit tensile forces to the extracellular matrix, thus {{it has been suggested}} that they are responsible for the wrinkling of the extracellular matrix and the formation of crimp. During anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft remodeling crimp formation plays an integral role. Thus, it was our purpose to determine the relationship between myofibroblast density and crimp frequency in human tendon graft tissue and the ACL. Methods: Different tendon grafts and ACLs were harvested from young human multi organ donors immediately after death. Myofibroblasts were immunostained with a monoclonal antibody and histomorphometry was performed using a digital imaging system. <b>Crimp</b> <b>length</b> was measured and data were correlated. Results: All tendons and ACLs showed a significant correlation of myofibroblast density and crimp frequency (R 2 0. 81 - 0. 43). The strongest correlation was found for the patellar tendon, the poorest for the gracilis tendon. There is also evidence that the phenotype, respectively the shape of myofibroblasts might be responsible for different stages of crimp formation. Conclusion: With the present investigation we found that myofibroblasts might be involved in crimp formation and should be viewed as an integral part of normal tendon and ligament tissue. Furthermore, the shape of myofibroblasts may further indicate the contractile potency of the extracellular matrix, thus presenting a dynamic and variable crimp rather than a static situation. This study is a experimental study. In terms of clinical relevance all the mentioned tendons can be used as auto- or allografts for ACL-reconstruction, nevertheless their microscopic structure and cellular population has yet not been adequately investigated and compared...|$|R
40|$|Reference {{is usually}} {{made to the}} {{parallel}} orientation towards the main line of exerted tension at the pubic joint in mice, for supporting forces applied to the joint. Despite the wealth of morphological information about the extracellular matrix in this joint, little is known regarding {{the involvement of the}} crimp of collagen fibers in the dramatic transformations occurring in this region during the last 3 days of pregnancy. Examination of the collagenous architecture suggests that the biomechanical properties are directly related to fibril diameters, composition of ground substance and changes in the bundle morphology, particularly in the crimp structure. {{the purpose of this study}} was to further describe the transformation of the collagen fibers of the pubic symphysis during late mouse pregnancy. We examined the architecture of collagen fibers in the symphysis and pubic ligament through the Picrosirius-polarization method and also through scanning electron microscopy to directly visualize and measure the crimping from pregnant and virgin mice. the crimp angle and the length of five consecutive crimps were measured according to Patterson-Kane et al. [Connect. Tissue Res. 36 (1997) 253]. It could be demonstrated that the angles progressively decreased and the <b>crimp</b> <b>length</b> increased, denoting that the fibers have untwisted during the relaxation process. Our findings suggest that a disruption of the helical arrangement of the collagen containing fibers may contribute to explaining the rapid remodeling that occurs at the end of pregnancy and that is responsible for an increase in pliancy and length of the pubic ligament in mice.

40|$|A {{series of}} studies was {{conducted}} {{to test the hypothesis}} that galloping exercise changes the morphology of collagen fibrils in the superficial digital flexor tendon of the equine forelimb. Tendons were examined from three groups of horses, namely wild horses, randomly sourced thoroughbred horses submitted for necropsy, and thoroughbreds from an experimental exercise trial. All tendons examined were from horses with no history of superficial digital flexor tendonitis, and all were macroscopically normal. Three studies involved the measurement of collagen fibril bundle 'crimp' morphology. The crimp, a planar waveform followed by the fibrils, is believed to determine in part the mechanical behaviour of tendon. The first study involved measurement of crimp angle and period length in central and peripheral regions of tendons from wild ponies ranging in age from two to over ten years, which had obviously never undergone training. Horses of ten years of age or older showed a mean crimp angle in the central region which was lower than that in the periphery. It was concluded that the reduction in central region crimp angle with age in untrained horses is a normal fatigue effect. The second study involved measurement of crimp parameters in central and peripheral regions of tendons from horses of two years and over which had been submitted for necropsy to Massey University. These horses were separated into 'exercised' and 'non-exercised' groups based on whether their most recent function had involved competitive galloping exercise. Five of the eight exercised horses under ten years of age had a lower mean <b>crimp</b> angle and <b>length</b> in the central region than in the peripheral region. No un-exercised horses in this age group showed lower values for either parameter in the central region as opposed to the periphery. It was therefore concluded that rapid high-strain cycling of the tendon occurring during galloping exercise modifies normal age-related changes in the crimp morphology of the superficial digital flexor tendon core. For the third study, <b>crimp</b> angle and <b>length</b> were measured in tendons from five thoroughbreds (39 ± 1 months of age) which had undergone a specific 18 month exercise regime involving galloping on a high-speed equine treadmill, and from six age- and sex-matched thoroughbreds which had undergone walking exercise only during that period. Central region <b>crimp</b> angle and <b>length</b> were significantly lower in the tendons of exercised horses compared to the controls. Four of the five exercised horses showed a significantly lower crimp angle in the central region than in the periphery, and three of these horses also showed a lower central <b>crimp</b> <b>length.</b> The peripheral angle was significantly greater in the exercised horses than in the controls. This was evidence that a specific and defined regime of high-strain cycling of the superficial digital flexor tendon modified age-related crimp morphology changes in the central region. Two studies were undertaken to investigate the effect of the above defined exercise regime on collagen fibril diameter distributions in the superficial digital flexor tendons, and in the deep digital flexor tendons and suspensory ligaments from the same horses. Central region fibrils in superficial digital flexor tendons from exercised horses had a significantly lower mass-average diameter than those from the control horses, whereas peripheral region fibrils from the two groups did not differ significantly. In the second study collagen fibril mass-average diameters in both regions of the deep digital flexor tendon and the suspensory ligament were not found to differ significantly in exercised horses compared to controls. It was concluded that the exercise regime had caused breakdown of large diameter collagen fibrils in the core of the superficial digital flexor tendon. The fact that such a change did not occur in the suspensory ligament was suggested to be due to a difference in distribution of load between the suspensory ligament and superficial digital flexor tendon during galloping, or due to differences in distribution of such changes along the lengths of the two structures. The final study involved an age-related analysis of crimp parameters, collagen fibril diameters and biochemical factors in thoroughbreds from foetuses to 3 years of age. It was suggested {{on the basis of the}} limited results, that collagen fibrils in the central region of the superficial digital flexor tendon become mature between one and two years of age. It is proposed that the observed reductions in crimp morphology and collagen fibril mass-average diameter in the core of the superficial digital flexor tendon in response to galloping exercise represent microtrauma, as they would lead to weakness of the structure and predispose it to overloading and further damage. The mechanisms involved are suggested to involve slippage and/or separation of subfibrils, and a mechanism for the development of tendon core lesions is hypothesized. The use of the present information for the prevention of tendonitis is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Minimization of {{response}} times and costs and maximization of {{the efficiency and}} quality in producing a product are imperative for survival in the competitive manufacturing industry. Sheet metal forming is a widely used and costly manufacturing process, to which these considerations apply. This work will be done to study the finite element (elastic-plastic) analysis of sheet metal crimp forming process using the finite element software. Ansys simulation is carried out to gain accurate and critical understanding of crimp forming process. Simulation of elastoplastic behavior of aluminum sheet is carried out with non-linear condition to investigate sheet metal crimping process. Maximum stress regions are identified. This can be improved by suitable curvature radius which is possible once FEM process is understood. In the present work contact elements are generated between crimp and crimp nut and the sliding dies for forming process. The contact pressure, vonmises stress and load requirements are captured for different angle of crimp sheets. The results shows drop in crimp load requirements with crimp metal inclination. Also a uniformity of contact is observed between crimp nut and crimp metal which is desirable feature for leak proof joints.

40|$|A {{new method}} to {{determine}} yarn bending and torsional rigidities was proposed in this paper. Measuring methods of yarn bending and yarn torsion were reviewed. The proposed method {{is a combination}} of theoretical modeling, instrumentation and statistical analysis. One major feature of this method is that bending and torsional rigidities of a naturally curved yarn, like those yarns in knitted fabrics, can be measured. With the aid of modeling, a recently developed <b>Crimped</b> Yarn <b>Length</b> Measurement Instrument (CLI) is able to measure both bending and torsional rigidities at the same time. The CLI generates a large amount of data points for the force and extension relationship during the decrimping of the curved yarn, multiple regression analysis was applied to determine bending and torsional rigidities. In this way, the experimental errors can be minimized and hence more representative results can be obtained. Experimental results from the new proposed method were compared with those measured by the KES-F bending tester and the KES-YN yarn torsion tester; good agreement was evident in testing results from both methods. The advantages of the proposed method were discussed including the capability of measuring the yarn bending rigidity at higher curvature.

40|$|Eri silk {{produced}} by Philosamia cynthia ricini silkworm is a fibre not well-known to the silk industry, {{in spite of}} the fact that Eri silk is finer, softer, and has better mechanical and thermal properties than most animal fibres. Eri silk has a high commercial potential, as the host plants of Eri silk worms are widespread in diverse geographical locations, and the worms also have a higher degree of disease resistance than most other silk worms. Mills are often not aware of the properties of Eri for designing appropriate end products. Thus, Eri silk yarn is traditionally {{produced by}} hand spinning, and Eri silk usually ends up as material for handwoven shawls. The potential for bulk fibre processing and the development of soft luxurious novel Eri silk products is yet to be discovered. To better understand the material and its processing behaviour, Eri silk was characterised and cocoons were processed into tops through degumming, opening, and cutting filaments into different lengths, followed by a worsted spun silk processing route. Fibre properties such as fineness, <b>crimp,</b> strength and <b>length</b> at different processing stages up to combed tops were measured.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine sheep growth performance, fleece weights and wool quality characteristics in the sweet and sourveld communal rangelands of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Data were obtained in 80 ewes aged two to three years, selected in four ecologically different communities. Two communities (Roxeni and Tyabane) were in a sweetveld area and the other two communities (Luzi I and Luzi II) were in a sourveld area. The ewes from Tyabane were nondescript, whereas ewes from Roxeni, Luzi I and Luzi II were crossbred between Merinos and non-descript sheep. Selected ewes were monitored for live weight, body condition scoring and fleece weight during shearing. Wool samples were collected from each ewe and were analysed for fibre diameter, comfort factor, clean yield, wool <b>crimps,</b> staple <b>length,</b> staple strength and the Position of break. Sheep from Roxeni were heavier (P < 0. 05) (39. 9 ± 1. 1 kg) than sheep from Tyabane (29. 8 ± 1. 1 kg). Sheep from Tyabane had the lightest (P < 0. 05) fleece weight (1. 0 ± 1. 1 kg) and sheep from Roxeni had the heaviest (3. 1 ± 1. 1 kg). There were no significant differences (P ≥ 0. 05) between body condition scores of sheep in Roxeni and the Luzi communities. The live weights of the two-year old ewes were similar (P ≥ 0. 05) to the three-year old ewes’ live weight. However, the three year old ewes had higher (P < 0. 05) body condition scores than the two year old ewes. Two year old ewes also had lower (P < 0. 05) fleece weight than the three years old ewes. Wool from Roxeni, Luzi I and Luzi II had lower fibre diameter (P < 0. 05) than wool from Tyabane. Roxeni sheep had the highest clean yield (P < 0. 05) of wool, followed by Luzi I and Luzi II; Tyabane had lowest clean yield percentage of wool. Wool from sheep grazing on sweetveld had a higher (P < 0. 05) clean yield percentage (74. 3 ± 0. 7 %) than those grazing on sourveld (71. 7 ± 0. 7 %). There were higher staple mid-breaks (69. 5 ± 5. 2) and lower base-breaks (30. 5 ± 5. 2) in sweetveld (P < 0. 05) than in sourveld, 7. 5 ± 5. 2 and 92. 5 ± 5. 2 for mid-breaks and lower base-breaks, respectively. It was concluded that sheep raised in the sweetveld and bred with purebred Merino rams had higher performance than the ones reared in the sourveld.

40|$|A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects that 5 different winter grazing systems had on some wool characteristics of pregnant N. Z. Romney ewes. The grazing systems were: (Tl) swedes on a daily break; (T 2) three weeks hay, three weeks swedes on a weekly break; (T 3) swedes on a daily break providing 75 % of the ration, hay daily providing 25 % of the ration; (T 4) pasture on a daily rotational break; (T 5) pasture under set-stocking. The treatments were applied for 6 weeks between mean days 74 and 116 of gestation. Feed intakes were higher on pasture than on swede crop treatments. Mean period intakes were: 0. 68, 0. 59, 0. 84, 0. 9, 1. 68 kg DM/ewe/day respectively for the 5 treatments, Tl to T 5. Pasture as a winter diet proved to be superior {{to any of the}} three forage crop (swede) variations of winter grazing for characteristics associated with wool growth rate. Differences were found between rotational grazing and set-stocking but neither was better over all characters assessed. Mean fibre diameter changes over the 6 week treatment period were: Tl, 32 to 27. 3 μm; T 2, 31. 2 to 24 μm; T 3, 31. 8 to 27. 4 μm; T 4, 33 to 31. 6 μm; T 5, 31. 7 to 33. 2 μm. Corresponding with these fibre diameter changes, tensile strength tests indicated that staples from forage crop treatments were weaker than those from pasture (5. 79 v 9. 22 kg/g/cm; p< 0. 001). Subjective soundness grades followed a similar pattern. Break usually coincided with the change from the crop back to pasture {{at the end of the}} treatment period. Hay with swedes tended to increase the tensile strength (6. 25 v 4. 75 kg/g/cm) by comparison to swedes alone. Clean weight of wool per unit area was at least 300 mg/cm 2 greater on pasture than on forage crops over the six weeks (p< 0. 001). Wool production from older ewes (≥ 5 years) was more strongly influenced by winter grazing than that of young ewes. Ewes bearing single lambs produced more wool per unit area (p< 0. 05), had greater fibre diameter (p< 0. 05), soundness grade (p< 0. 05),tip grade (p< 0. 05) and character grade (p< 0. 10) than those bearing twin lambs. Other characteristics measured were: fibre length, quality number. Staple <b>length,</b> <b>crimp</b> frequency, handle, lustre, colour and cotting.
