No evidence was found in any patient of any systemic disease process associated with small artery obstruction.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} and {{reforms in the}} Russian payments system are discussed {{from the perspective of}} their impact on monetary policy. The large and highly variable payment float in the balance sheet of the Central Bank of Russia has complicated the conduct of monetary policy. However, reforms in late 1992 and early 1993 have been effective, as judged from their impact in reducing the level and variability of float, and have set the stage for medium-term reforms of the payments system. Rapid progress in the implementation of these reforms, and their appropriate coordination with monetary operations, remain critical to meet the emerging needs in money and foreign exchange markets, and to support the transition to indirect methods of monetary control.

40|$|Introduction. Necrosis of the rectum is an {{uncommon}} finding due to abundant <b>collateral</b> vasculature.

We describe {{a case of a}} 53 -year-old woman with multiple medical comorbidities that presented in septic shock and hematochezia. Colonoscopy revealed ischemic colitis. Conservative management was instituted. At two weeks, she presented evidence of peritonitis. Exploratory laparotomy revealed extensive necrosis of the left colon and rectum. Due to dense inflammation, resection was deemed unsafe. Therefore, a transverse ostomy with mucosal fistula was preformed. Multiple drains were left in place. The patient healed uneventfully. Conclusion. This case illustrates that, if extensive dissection of the distal colon and rectum is unsafe due to the patient's critical condition or technical feasibility, then a diverting ostomy of the proximal viable bowel along with a mucus fistula and good drainage of the abdomen represents an acceptable alternative...|$|R
40|$|Penile {{necrosis}} is a {{very rare}} complication because of its rich <b>collateral</b> supply. Conservative <b>management</b> is apt to be ineffective; thus penectomy is usually performed. We present a case of penile necrosis and claudication of both legs with multiple atherosclerosis in a type II diabetes mellitus patient who was successfully treated with angioplasty, penoplasty, and additional intracavernous injections of prostaglandin E 1. The treatment resulted in relief of the leg pain and healing of the penile ischemic lesions. Key Words: Atherosclerosis; Necrosis; Penis Penile necrosis may accompany health problems such as disseminated infections and circulatory disorders. Ische-mia of the penis is relatively rare because of its excellent collateral vessels [1]. Until recently, a surgical procedure such as penectomy was the only treatment option.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} the development and natural history of Portal Hypertension are far away to be clearly known. Endoscpic Ultrasonography is a branch of gastrointestinal endoscopy, that has achieved a world wide acceptance in the evaluation of many clinical settings during last years. Some of these indications are now clearly stated, while others are under evaluation. The possibility to apply EUS in portal hypertension has been studied by several Authors during last years, both in the diagnosis and in the management of this complication of liver cirrhosis. In fact EUS studies have been performed on the hemodynamic assessment of portal vein system, azygos vein, varices and portosystemic <b>collaterals.</b> In the <b>management</b> of portal hypertension EUS has been studied both for the assessment of the efficacy of drug therapy and for endocopic treatment. Data obtained are preliminary but very interesting and promising, and have given a great impulse to this field of clinical research.

40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} hedge fund {{industry}} has brought substantial benefits to financial markets. At the same time, hedge funds can {{in some circumstances}} {{give rise to a}} number of potential risks. Not unlike in the period following the Asian crisis and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, governments, regulators, and central banks have been called upon to assess whether additional regulatory initiatives are required to mitigate these risks. There are three potential regulatory objectives that can be invoked. They are investor protection, market integrity protection and financial system protection. The link between hedge funds and the stability of the financial system relates to the possibility that large losses in one or several hedge funds get transmitted to one or several large internationally active banks.

In addition, they should conduct rigorous periodical stress-testing. • On the basis {{of a wide range of}} stress test scenarios which are routinely updated, global margin call simulations across all exposures should be conducted between the prime broker dealers and the largest hedge funds on a regular basis. • Prime broker dealers and their most important hedge fund clients should take advantage of benign market conditions to work out clear terms to determine margin call procedures for different simulated scenarios assuming extended adverse market conditions. • The underlying liquidity profi le of hedge funds should be an important element in conducting stress tests and margin call simulations as well as in determining margin call procedures under adverse market conditions. ...|$|R
