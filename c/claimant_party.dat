40|$|John McClellan {{was among}} the {{original}} founders of the Sioux Falls town site in Dakota Territory in the year 1857. During his lifetime, McClellan never spoke much about his family or his origins. After amassing considerable wealth selling land in the 1870 s and 1880 s, McClellan died in an elevator accident in 1899. His death left open {{the question of who}} would inherit his money and property. Three groups of claimants came before the local courts with the belief that John McClellan was, in some way, their relative. After eighteen years of litigation, none of the <b>claimant</b> <b>parties</b> could prove that the man who died in Sioux Falls was their relative by the name John McClellan. As a result, the courts escheated McClellan’s estate to the state of South Dakota. Given the evidence presented by the claimants, the question remains {{as to whether or not}} this was the correct decision. By utilizing the archived materials from the McClellan estate trial, the two Sioux Falls newspapers of the day, and various other documents from throughout the United States, it was possible to thoroughly reexamine the cases presented by all three of the trial’s <b>claimant</b> <b>parties.</b> The research material showed that each claimant had a relative named John McClellan, and all of their documented family stories seemed to fit the pattern o...|$|R

Since Victor Pradera, who previously represented the party in Cortes, joined the secessionists, in the 1919 campaign Baleztena took {{his place in the}} Pamplona district and was successfully voted into the parliament. The following year he again accessed the Carlist-Basque-conservative alliance; in Pamplona its candidates were not even challenged and he was declared victorious according to the famous Article 29.

The result was Alianza Foral coalition, constructed to defend and promote traditional vasco-navarrese legal establishments. It produced fairly successful co-operation especially during provincial elections, though it also caused controversies within Navarrese Carlism. The Baleztenas continued with their vasco-navarrese strategy also by means of cultural mobilization; in 1922 they joined Comisión para la Restauración de Monumentos de Navarra, accused by Traditionalist pundits of fostering separatism.|$|R
40|$|The Article {{is about}} {{security}} for costs in international arbitration under the ICC and ICSID Rules. It explains who is entitled to submit such a request, what kind of costs are secured, whether the tribunal has authority to order such measure, and the basis of such authority. This {{is followed by the}} discussion of the conditions for ordering the measure and the reasons that speak against it. Among various exceptional circumstances justifying the measure that are mentioned in arbitral case law, the following are discussed in more detail: manifest insolvency or bankruptcy of the claimant, SPV as <b>claimant,</b> third <b>party</b> financing of the claim, change of circumstances, respondent is not a signatory to the arbitration agreement, and probability that respondent will be awarded costs. Reasons speaking against the measure mentioned in the cases are the following: consent to the risk of insolvent claimant, access to arbitral justice, equity, respondent's bad faith, and untimeliness of the request. Finally, certain questions of procedure are discussed such as burden of proof and consequences of claimant's non-compliance with the order to pay security. The author concludes that in ICC and ICSID arbitration arbitrators are reluctant to order {{security for costs}} although such requests by respondents have become more frequent in recent times. The threshold respondent must pass to convince the tribunal that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the measure is high. The fact that claimant is insolvent alone does not suffice for the success of such request...|$|R
50|$|A Rocket Docket is a controverted claim, {{basically}} {{meaning that}} the insurance company is fighting the case. A report must be produced within 90 days of the pre-trial hearing. An insurance company may request that an IME Vendor set up Surveillance on a claimant. Reason being, if the claimant says they have a broken collar bone and the surveillance catches them at the batting cages, now the insurance company can ask the IME doctor to review the footage and medical records, see the claimant and dictate a report. Adjusters have been known {{in the past to}} have checked on Facebook {{to find out what the}} claimant is doing lately. For example, if PTSD or depression is an alleged claim from an accident, but the <b>claimant</b> is out <b>partying</b> or going on tropical vacations and posting pictures, this could look rather suspicious. The adjuster will then ask that the doctor question the claimant on their hobbies.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{document}} is to analyse the peculiar features of the English and the Norwegian P&I Clubs from a comparative perspective. In particular, this study approaches how the following three topics are dealt with by P&I Clubs in the named jurisdictions: i) the ¨Pay to be paid rule¨; ii) the possibility of third <b>party</b> <b>claimants</b> to file recovery actions directly againts P&I Clubs; and iii) the P&I Clubs´ position regarding cover when letters of indemnity are accepted by the assured in exchange of delivering cargo without presentation of a bill of lading. It is my personal view that these topics are of great importance for a shipowner because they {{have an impact on}} their business and even though {{much has been written about}} these topics, little is said from a comparative perspective. Apart from the market impact, these issues are connected because P&I Clubs are usually vested with discretionary powers that entitle them to make decisions on the application of cover irrespective of what the standard rules exclude. Ideally, the present text will provide further insight to this type of insurance which shipowners and insurance brokers may utilize when choosing a P&I Club...|$|R
40|$|Shipowners {{are exposed}} {{to a variety of}} risks that are, to a large extent, unique to {{maritime}} business. Because of factors like the recent increase in the size and value of ships, increase in marine traffic, enactment of legislation imposing new liabilities, and the tendency of courts to make huge awards to personal injury and death claims, shipowners {{are exposed to}} potential losses or claims worth millions of dollars in the event of disaster. These heavy risks led to the establishment of the marine insurance industry, as well as the enactment of legislation that limits shipowners’ liability. This legislation was designed not only to preserve the shipping industry for its valuable role in international commerce and trade, but also to encourage investment in and expansion of a strong merchant marine. This paper seeks to find the justification, if any, for the continued existence of this legislation limiting shipowners’ liability. This paper also seeks to resolve the confusion created by the courts’ inconsistent reasoning in their attempts to ensure adequate compensation for personal injury and death claimants, and to analyze the role that marine liability insurance plays in the protection of both shipowners and third <b>party</b> <b>claimants...</b>|$|R
40|$|Written laws guiding civil {{actions in}} the federal {{district}} courts chiefly address the presentation, preparation and resolution of claims involving parties. However, the courts often also consider claims involving non-parties as well as non-claim matters involving parties and non-parties alike. Guidelines here mainly appear in federal precedents and, to a lesser extent, in local court rules. They often follow in-state court practices. The absence of written general laws for non-party claims and non-claim matters often leads to unnecessary confusion and unfair procedures. New, generally applicable written guidelines could help reduce uncertainty and promote fairness. To exemplify, we shall particularly explore possible reforms in settlement conference settings where the interests of non-party insurers are at stake, {{as well as in}} adjudicatory settings where non-party insurers seek recoveries from proceeds obtained by their insureds as <b>party</b> <b>claimants.</b> Before doing so, we will review briefly the major forms of adjudicatory and ancillary powers over non-party claims and non-claim matters not only to illustrate the absence of non-party insurers in written civil procedure laws, but also because any possible reforms must take account of these limited powers. We then shall examine several settlement conference and adjudicatory authority cases involving non-party insurers that have prompted confusion and unfairness. We conclude with suggestions on promoting fuller recognition and participation of non-party insurers in federal civil actions, as well as with some thoughts on other non-party claims and on non-claim matters...|$|R
40|$|The rise {{of social}} media has given {{insurers}} a potent investigative weapon: forensic {{analysis of a}} claimant's social media footprint. Evidence is increasingly acquired from a public social media space in which a claimant inhabits {{with a degree of}} expected privacy, and connected friends and contacts within social networks are increasingly investigated to identify networks and potential co-conspirators. Ethical issues abound where investigators 'friend' a claimant or a member of their network to acquire evidence. The gathering of this evidence trail often arises in dealing with the private law civil litigation claims process, initiated by the third <b>party</b> <b>claimant.</b> The private law regulation of the acquisition, deployment and purpose of this evidence differs from the conventional public regulatory and enforcement context, but shares some objectives, and engages issues of data sharing with law enforcement agencies. A recent trend has seen insurers increasingly ask civil courts in compensation litigation to visit sanctions, including imprisonment and fines, for civil contempt of court established against litigants proved to be dishonest using social media evidence, contrasted with their 'statements of truth'. What tensions exist between private and public law processes here? How well does the civil litigation process cope with this phenomenon? Will aspects of the Jackson reforms affect behaviours? Do these investigation techniques sit well with domestic professional regulation and ethical behaviours? How do other jurisdictions deal with the issues? This paper aims to explore some of these topical issues...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{arguments}} being made by those displeased with Hobby Lobby is that discretionary religious exemptions, like RFRA, violate the Establishment Clause when the accommodation results in harm to third parties. It is an establishment of religion, it is claimed, when such exemptions override the interests of third parties who do not share {{the faith of the}} religious <b>claimants.</b> These third <b>parties</b> lose a valuable benefit, and do so just so the claimants of the exemption can better exercise their religion. That has the government preferring religion over nonreligious interest, insist the critics. This argument is taken up in a new article linked below. In a consistent line of six cases, the Supreme Court has turned back the claim that religious exemptions, whether enacted by statute or the result of official policy, violate the Establishment Clause. The leading case is Corporation of the Presiding Bishop v. Amos, where the Court upheld an exemption for religious employers from Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. There are no cases to the contrary. The critics cite to Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, but the law at issue in Caldor was a naked religious preference not a religious exemption. A religious exemption lifts a burden from a religious claimant, one that was originally imposed by the government itself by regulation or taxation. The net result is that those who practice religion are left alone, and government does not advance religion by leaving it alone. A preference, on the other hand, is when the government newly enters the private sector and extends a benefit or advantage on religious persons because of their religion. The Connecticut law struck down in Caldor was of the latter sort; the state was not relieving a burden from an earlier imposed regulation but taking the side of religion over the secular in a private dispute...|$|R
5000|$|When {{confronting the}} pro-German Mellistas Melgar {{resolved}} to provocations but mostly embarked on massive Gallophile propaganda. His pamphlets, designed either for Spanish or foreign audience, advanced {{all sort of}} arguments against the Central Powers, lambasting their Carlist supporters as [...] "carlo-luteranos" [...] and mocking their slogan as [...] "Dios, Patria, Alemania". In 1916 he considered setting up a pro-French daily in Madrid and possibly appeared in Spain himself. He might have misled de Cerralbo as to actual position of the claimant. In 1917-1918 he was increasingly ostracized among the Carlists. When in early 1919 Don Jaime managed to leave Austria and arrived in Paris, his first step was consulting Melgar before he released a manifesto - allegedly written by Melgar - which announced forthcoming personal measures against those deemed disloyal. De Mella and his followers intended {{to show up in}} the French capital and present their case but were denied visas, a Machiavellian intrigue also attributed to Melgar. The Mellistas, who already considered Don Jaime [...] "a toy of Melgar", gave up and decided to break away, setting up their own party; Cerralbo resigned.Following the breakup Melgar focused on purging the party newspaper from the Mellistas; as he remained a lone player and did not build his own political background, the term [...] "Melgaristas" [...] was scarcely in circulation. When the new provisional party leader Pascual Comín was to be replaced in the summer of 1919, Don Jaime asked Melgar to become his representative in Spain, but the 70-year-old refused, probably conscious that in the party feelings against him were running high. As demands to get rid of Melgar reached the claimant he realized this as well; Melgar was not invited to take part in Magna Junta de Biarritz, a grand Carlist assembly entrusted with working out the Carlist course into the future. Starting 1920 he is no longer mentioned as acting in-between the <b>claimant</b> and the <b>party</b> leadership, though some sources claim that until the mid-1920s he served as secretary and counselor to his king, in 1923 replaced by own son. Since 1914 Melgar suffered from limited financial resources; according to one source he spent his last years in poverty.|$|R
