40|$|The mostly clay {{cliffs of}} Barton-on-Sea, Hampshire, {{comprise}} inhomogeneous strata of the Bracklesham, Barton and Headon Hill Formations, overlain unconformably by Plateau Gravels, {{and have a}} long history of erosion and instability. Heavily-engineered stabilisation works involving a 1, 500 m-long sheet-piled wall and <b>cut-off</b> <b>drain</b> were installed in the 1960 s but a number of catastrophic failures of the wall have occurred at locations along the Barton frontage since then. This report is concerned with the failures at Cliff House Hotel / Tom’s Garden and at Hoskins Gap West. Extensive monitoring of the cliffs over the past sixty years has produced a large and diverse dataset which has been compiled, analysed and assessed in this report. This includes inclinometer, piezometer and rainfall records, topographic surveying, aerial and ground photography, borehole and exposures logs, consultants’ reports, engineering drawings and newspaper articles. This report identifies characteristics of the key periods of activity at the two locations and compares and contrasts them. Maps of the areas of activity, cliff-top retreat, revetment movement and drainage patterns are provided. Fieldwork undertaken for the project includes the logging of three cliff exposures and the surveying of four cross-section profiles. Drawing on the information available it charts the progress of instability in the two study areas, suggests possible mechanisms for the failures and offers a prediction of future activity based upon the mechanisms described...|$|E
40|$|Paokahu {{landfill}} operated near Gisborne from 1977 to 2002. About {{1 million}} cubic metres of mixed domestic and industrial (predominantly food processing) wastes were disposed {{of at the}} site. The Paokahu landfill {{is located on the}} Poverty Bay Flats on low lying flat ground, which was originally the base of a tidal lagoon. A 300 m wide band of costal dunes separates the landfill from the Poverty Bay coast. The landfill covers an area of approximately 20 Ha and is unlined but fully capped. Leachate is collected in a <b>cut-off</b> <b>drain</b> which surrounds three quarters of the landfill. Disposal of the leachate is by spray irrigation onto the landfill cap with 13, 000 - 15, 000 m 3 of leachate irrigated annually. The site is currently used for grazing sheep. The overall aim {{of this study was to}} improve our understanding of the effect that Paokahu landfill is having on the environment and to determine if the current management practices are sustainable. Specific objectives were to collate and review all the groundwater and leachate monitoring data held by Gisborne District Council to determine if the landfill was affecting the local groundwater and to investigate the effect of leachate irrigation on the landfill cap's soil and vegetation. The groundwater monitoring data showed the local groundwater was generally affected by salt water intrusions giving the groundwater high anion and cation concentrations. There was no evidence of a leachate plume originating from the landfill and no conclusive evidence of leachate contamination in any of the groundwater monitoring bores. The leachate had a high electrical conductivity (mean = 9350 Scm- 1) and high soluble salts content (mean values, Na = 845 gm- 3, K= 496 gm- 3, Ca = 240 gm- 3, Mg = 127 gm- 3, Cl = 1346 gm- 3). Heavy metals were present in low concentrations and Semi Volatile Organic Compounds were no longer present in the leachate. Cation and anion concentrations were generally higher in the groundwater than in the leachate. The main risk to groundwater quality from leachate contamination was from ammonical nitrogen and nitrate. The leachate irrigation had caused an increase in soil cation concentrations particularly Na in the landfill cap. However, the soil Exchangeable Sodium Percentage of 1. 5 - 2. 9, leachate Sodium Adsorption Ratio (6. 5) and Electrical Conductivity of (4317 S cm- 1) and silty soil material of the landfill cap indicated that soil swelling and dispersion was unlikely to occur in irrigated areas of the landfill cap. Dispersion index testing supported this conclusion with no significant increase in aggregate dispersion under the irrigated areas of the landfill compared to the non-irrigated areas. Soil metal concentrations were low and there was no significant difference in soil heavy metal concentrations between the irrigated and non-irrigated areas of the landfill cap. Leachate Mn concentrations (mean = 1. 39 g m- 3) were high enough to be potentially toxic to plants, but the soil pH (7. 4) and Ca (46. 7 me/ 100 g) content mean that Mn toxicity is unlikely to occur. Leachate irrigation appears sustainable under current conditions...|$|E
5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) <b>cut-off</b> <b>drains</b> were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|R
40|$|Despite several {{approaches}} that aimed at mobilising East African farmers to embrace {{soil and water}} conservation (SWC) activities, farmers hardly responded since they were seldom involved in the planning of SWC activities. Two tools that employ farmers' participation were developed and applied at Gikuuri catchment in Kenya. The first tool involved farmers to map soil erosion using their own indicators and determine the soil erosion status at catchment scale. This formed the basis upon which they undertook to plan for SWC measures at catchment scale. Farmers also predicted crop yield losses based on the soil erosion status. Farmers widely approved the soil erosion status map since their own indicators and perceptions were used. The second tool provided cash flow trends for a variety of SWC activities and farmer situations. Farmers can use land with a high, moderate or low erosion status and often have rather different socio-economic settings. The net benefits over 5 yr for bench terraces, fanya juu terraces and grass strips were illustrated to assist farmers in making informed decisions on SWC adoption. The two tools increased awareness on the need for collective actions among farmers and showed fields that cause run-on on downslope fields. The improved awareness of erosion problems and the related financial consequences increased farmers' willingness to share the investment costs for <b>cut-off</b> <b>drains...</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{is limited}} {{documentation}} {{of soil and}} water management technologies that enhance {{adaptation to climate change}} in drylands of Kenya. Rainfall patterns were analyzed in the semi-arid Machakos and Makueni counties of eastern Kenya using historical data. A total of forty-three smallholder farmers implementing soil water management practices were sampled, and an estimate of the seasonal water budget for current crop and livestock production systems computed. Analysis of rainfall amounts and distribution shows increasing variability, with the average annual total amounts decreasing over the past 50 years. Furthermore, the number of rainy days within the March-April-May season that can support crop growth is gradually decreasing. These decreases are however not significant at P < 0. 05. There were more seasons with low rainfall amounts compared to those with high rainfall amounts. All these subject the smallholder crop and livestock production system to limited soil moisture. Farmers address the risk by harnessing and utilizing green (rainfall stored in soil) and blue (rainfall collected into storage tanks) water technologies. The study found that farmers in these semi-arid counties practice fifteen diverse soil and water management interventions on their farms. The most popular practices are <b>cut-off</b> <b>drains,</b> retention ditches, terracing, run-off harvesting, and agroforestry. The estimated seasonal water budget indicates the need for integrated soil and water management interventions to address the crop and livestock production constraints. Peer Revie...|$|R
