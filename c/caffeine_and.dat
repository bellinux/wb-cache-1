5|$|Apart {{from its}} use in {{fertilisers}} and energy-stores, nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as Kevlar used in high-strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue. Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class, including antibiotics. Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen-containing signal molecules: for example, the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide. Many notable nitrogen-containing drugs, such as the natural <b>caffeine</b> <b>and</b> morphine or the synthetic amphetamines, act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters.|$|E
5|$|Between World War I and World War II, {{many new}} aspirin brands and aspirin-based {{products}} entered the market. The Australian company Nicholas Proprietary Limited, through the aggressive marketing strategies of George Davies, built Aspro {{into a global}} brand, with particular strength in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K. American brands such as Burton's Aspirin, Molloy's Aspirin, Cal-Aspirin and St. Joseph Aspirin tried {{to compete with the}} American Bayer, while new products such Cafaspirin (aspirin with <b>caffeine)</b> <b>and</b> Alka-Seltzer (a soluble mix of aspirin and bicarbonate of soda) put aspirin to new uses. In 1925, the German Bayer became part of IG Farben, a conglomerate of former dye companies; IG Farben's brands of Aspirin and, in Latin America, the caffeinated Cafiaspirina (co-managed with Sterling Products) competed with less expensive aspirins such as Geniol.|$|E

40|$|A {{prevalent}} combination {{in daily}} life, performance pressure <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> intake {{have both been}} shown to impact people's cognitive performance. Here, we examined the possibility that pressure <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> affect cognitive performance via a shared pathway. In an experiment, participants performed a modular arithmetic task. Performance pressure <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> intake were orthogonally manipulated. Findings indicated that pressure <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> both negatively impacted performance. However, (a) pressure vs. caffeine affected performance on different trial types, and (b) there was no hint of an interactive effect. So, though the evidence is indirect, findings suggest that pressure <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> shape performance via distinct mechanisms, rather than a shared one...|$|R
25|$|Water extraction: Coffee {{beans are}} soaked in water. The water, which {{contains}} many other compounds {{in addition to}} <b>caffeine</b> <b>and</b> contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through activated charcoal, which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor.

40|$|This work {{describes}} the simultaneous determination of catechins <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> in green, black tealeaves and canned tea-drink using micellar electrokinetic chromatography. The catechins analyzed include(+) -catechin, (-) -epicatechin, (-) -epigallocatechin, (-) -epicatechin gallate and (-) -epigallocatechin gallate. Using UV absorption method at 280 nm, {{the limits of}} detections of catechins <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> are 10 (- 6) mol/L, which is suitable for the real sample determination. Using this analytical method, the extraction of these compounds from the tealeaves with hot water is compared under different temperatures. The effects of temperature {{on the amount of}} catechins <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> extracted are evident, showing that (-) -epigallocatechin gallate is the most easiest to be extracted at 100 degreesC. The stability of catechins <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> in stocking solution of tea-drink at 4 degreesC is also compared on five consecutive days. The contents of catechins <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> in green <b>and</b> black teas are discussed and the difference of the content between different tealeaves can provide a reference for the assessment of tea quality...|$|R

40|$|Objective Sleep {{problems}} are a cardinal symptom {{of depression in}} children <b>and</b> adolescents <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> use is a prevalent and problematic issue in youth; yet {{little is known about}} <b>caffeine</b> use <b>and</b> its effects on sleep in youth with depression. We examined <b>caffeine</b> use <b>and</b> its relation to sleep and affect in youth’s natural environments. Methods Thirty youth with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 23 control youth reported on <b>caffeine</b> use, sleep, <b>and</b> affect in their natural environment using ecological momentary assessment at baseline and over 8 weeks, while MDD youth received treatment. Results Youth with MDD reported more <b>caffeine</b> use <b>and</b> sleep problems relative to healthy youth. Youth with MDD reported more anxiety on days they consumed caffeine. Caffeine use among youth with MDD decreased across treatment, but sleep complaints remained elevated. Conclusions Findings suggest that both sleep quality <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> use are altered in pediatric depression; that caffeine use, but not sleep problems, improves with treatment; <b>and</b> that <b>caffeine</b> may exacerbate daily anxiety among youth with depression.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{relationships}} between nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and (a) fetal growth restriction; <b>and</b> (b) maternal <b>caffeine</b> metabolism <b>and</b> fetal growth restriction. A cohort of 2, 643 pregnant women, aged 18 - 45  years, attending two UK maternity units between 8 and 12  weeks gestation, was recruited. A validated tool assessed caffeine intake at different stages of pregnancy <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> metabolism was assessed from a caffeine challenge test. Experience of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy was self-reported for each trimester. Adjustment was made for confounders, including salivary cotinine as a biomarker of current smoking status. There were no significant associations between fetal growth restriction and nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, even after adjustment for smoking and alcohol intake. There were no significant differences in the relationship between <b>caffeine</b> intake <b>and</b> fetal growth restriction between those experiencing symptoms of nausea and vomiting and those who did not, for either the first (p =  0. 50) or second trimester (p =  0. 61) after adjustment for smoking, alcohol intake <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> half-life. There were also no significant differences in the relationship between <b>caffeine</b> half-life <b>and</b> fetal growth restriction between those experiencing symptoms of nausea and vomiting and those who did not, for either the first trimester (p =  0. 91) or the second trimester (p =  0. 45) after adjusting for smoking, alcohol intake <b>and</b> <b>caffeine</b> intake. The results from this study show no evidence that the relationship between maternal <b>caffeine</b> intake <b>and</b> fetal growth restriction is modified by nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. 11550...|$|R
