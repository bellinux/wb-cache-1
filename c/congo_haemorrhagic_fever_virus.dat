40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess and {{describe}} the current spectrum of emerging zoonoses between 2000 and 2006 in European countries. A computerized search of the Medline database from January 1966 to August 2006 for all zoonotic agents in European countries was performed using specific criteria for emergence. Fifteen pathogens were identified as emerging in Europe from 2000 to August 2006 : Rickettsiae spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Francisella tularensis, Crimean <b>Congo</b> <b>Haemorrhagic</b> <b>Fever</b> <b>Virus,</b> Hantavirus, Toscana virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus group, West Nile virus, Sindbis virus, Highly Pathogenic Avian influenza, variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, Trichinella spp., and Echinococus multilocularis. Main risk factors included climatic variations, certain human activities as well as movements of animals, people or goods. Multi-disciplinary preventive strategies addressing these pathogens are of public health importance.

40|$|Crimean <b>Congo</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> (CCHFV) is a {{bunyavirus}} with a single-stranded RNA genome {{consisting of}} three segments (S, M, L), coding for the nucleocapsid protein, envelope glycoproteins and RNA polymerase, respectively. To date only five complete genome sequences {{are available from}} southern African isolates. Complete genome sequences were generated for 10 southern African CCHFV isolates using next-generation sequencing techniques. The maximum-likelihood method was used to generate tree topologies for 15 southern African plus 26 geographically distinct complete sequences from GenBank. M segment reassortment was identified in 10 / 15 southern African isolates by incongruencies in grouping compared to the S and L segments. These reassortant M segments cluster with isolates from Asia/Middle East, while the S and L segments cluster with strains from South/West Africa. The CCHFV M segment shows {{a high level of}} genetic diversity, while the S and L segments appear to co-evolve. The reason for the high frequency of M segment reassortment is not known. It has previously been suggested that M segment reassortment results in a virus with high fitness but a clear role in increased pathogenicity has yet to be shown.

40|$|Crimean <b>Congo</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> (CCHFV) is a tick borne {{nairovirus}} {{responsible for}} a highly fatal human disease with increased recent incidence within the human population of southern Europe. Hazara virus (HAZV), another tick borne nairovirus of the same serogroup as CCHFV, is not pathogenic in humans, but infection with HAZV results in a similar disease progression in interferon receptor knockout mice to CCHFV. In order to investigate further similarities between HAZV and CCHFV, and to {{support the use of}} HAZV as a model for CCHFV infection, various structural and cell biological aspects of the CCHFV and HAZV replication cycle were investigated. We present the X-ray crystal structure of the nucleocapsid protein (N) of HAZV at a resolution of 2. 7 Å, and the crystal structure of RNA-bound HAZV N at a resolution of 3 Å. HAZV N had a highly similar overall structure to CCHFV N, consisting of a globular domain containing amino acid residues from both the N and the C-termini, and an extended arm domain. A crevice within the globular domain of HAZV N had 3 nucleotides of RNA bound, in the RNA-bound HAZV N structure. RNA binding is a crucial function of HAZV N and CCHFV N, and the identification of an RNA binding site in HAZV N provides a model for the structure guided design of anti-virals to disrupt this interaction. Cellular heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) was found to be an interacting partner of the N protein of CCHFV and HAZV, both in cells and in secreted HAZV particles. The functional role of this interacting partner within the HAZV replication cycle was investigated using siRNA knock down and small molecule inhibitors of endogenous HSP 70. HAZV induced apoptosis in SW 13 cells, and HAZV N was cleaved during a 72 hr time course of infection. The data presented here also reveals new insights into the replication cycles of HAZV and CCHFV. ...|$|E

Given the on-going risk of emerging infectious disease outbreaks in an era of unprecedented population density, international travel and human impact on the environment it is pertinent to focus on improving the research and development landscape for treatments of emerging and epidemic-prone infections.

40|$|Crimean <b>Congo</b> <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> (CCHFV) is a negative-strand RNA virus {{belonging}} to the genus Nairovirus of the Bunyaviridae family. The virus is present in about 30 countries and it is maintained in vertical and horizontal transmission cycles involving ixodid ticks {{and a variety of}} wild and domestic vertebrates, which do not show signs of illness. In particular, ticks of the genus Hyalomma seem to be the principal vectors and play an important role as a natural reservoir. Human infections begin with nonspecific febrile symptoms that progress to a serious haemorrhagic syndrome with a high case fatality rate. To date, no specific treatment or vaccine are available and prevention of human disease depends merely on avoiding bites from infected ticks and contact with infected blood or tissues. Despite a wide distribution, the pathogenesis of CCHF remains poorly understood, because of limited human pathology and the need for biosafety level 4 facilities. The major pathological abnormalities of CCHF are alteration of vascular barrier function and haemorrhage. Endothelial damage can contribute to coagulopathy but it is still unknown whether vascular dysfunction is due to a direct effect of virus on the endothelial cells or to a consequence of a cytokine storm. Indeed, elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (such as TNF-α, IL- 6, IL- 10) and serum markers of vascular activation (sICAM- 1 and sVCAM- 1) have been detected in fatal CCHF cases. In vitro experiments in human target cell lines have shown that CCHFV induces apoptosis late post infection and the release of TNF-α, IL- 6 and IL- 8, with the activation of endothelial cells. Although CCHFV is sensitive to type I interferons in vitro at the early stage of infection, IFN has no significant activity against an already established CCHFV infection, suggesting that CCHFV strongly counteracts IFN signalling. It has been demonstrated that CCHFV employs a range of strategies to evade and counteract the innate immune response to establish viral infection. Despite an improved knowledge of the viral biology and {{a better understanding of the}} disease clinical aspects, there are still many gaps to be filled. In this context, our research is focused on the study of vector-virus interaction and on the development of innovative vaccine approaches based on virus like particles/recombinant viruses for the control and prevention of human disease...|$|E

40|$|The {{attachment}} of ubiquitin (Ub) and the Ub-like (Ubl) molecule interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG 15) to {{cellular proteins}} mediates important innate antiviral responses. Ovarian tumor (OTU) domain proteases from nairoviruses and arteriviruses were recently found to remove these molecules from host proteins, which inhibits Ub and ISG 15 -dependent antiviral pathways. This {{contrasts with the}} Ub-specific activity of known eukaryotic OTU-domain proteases. Here we describe crystal structures of a viral OTU domain from the highly pathogenic Crimean–Congo <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> (CCHFV) bound to Ub and to ISG 15 at 2. 5 -Å and 2. 3 -Å resolution, respectively. The complexes provide a unique structural example of ISG 15 bound to another protein and reveal the molecular mechanism of an ISG 15 cross-reactive deubiquitinase. To accommodate structural differences between Ub and ISG 15, the viral protease binds the β-grasp folds of Ub and C-terminal Ub-like domain of ISG 15 in an orientation that is rotated nearly 75 ° with respect to that observed for Ub bound to a representative eukaryotic OTU domain from yeast. Distinct structural determinants necessary for binding either substrate were identified and allowed the reengineering of the viral OTU protease into enzymes with increased substrate specificity, either for Ub or for ISG 15. Our findings now provide the basis to determine in vivo the relative contributions of deubiquitination and deISGylation to viral immune evasion tactics, and a structural template of a promiscuous deubiquitinase from a <b>haemorrhagic</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> that can be targeted for inhibition using small-molecule-based strategies...|$|R
