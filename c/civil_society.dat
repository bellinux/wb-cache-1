5|$|According {{to human}} rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch the {{government}} of Zimbabwe violates the rights to shelter, food, freedom of movement and residence, freedom of assembly {{and the protection of}} the law.

5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, they tend to be totalitarians, which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the <b>civil</b> <b>society.</b> To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation of <b>civil</b> <b>society,</b> engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration. As a Roman Catholic, he was not a political threat to Suharto.|$|E
5|$|Déby {{attempted}} {{to reconcile the}} rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a new constitution by referendum, and in 1996, Déby easily won a competitive presidential election. He won a second term five years later. Oil exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a new civil war broke out. Déby unilaterally modified the constitution to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> and opposition parties.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to provide}} a wider understanding of the role of <b>civil</b> <b>societies</b> in Nicaragua and El Salvador. The main argument of this paper is {{based on the idea that}} <b>civil</b> <b>societies</b> improve the relation between the state and citizens at all times but most remarkably in times of transition. The purpose of this study is to investigate the importance of <b>civil</b> <b>societies</b> in the transition of El Salvador and Nicaragua, which foster the development and independence of the region. Furthermore, this study attempts to prove that the state, <b>civil</b> <b>societies</b> and the citizens are interconnected in a theoretical perspective which explains the relationship between political, economic, and social structures and the relations with social actors...|$|R

The Communist Party of Belarus won 3 seats, and the Agrarian Party and Republican Party of Labour and Justice, one each.

5|$|Society {{became more}} liberal (as seen, for instance, in the {{achievements}} of the Polish Film School and the creation of such controversial movies as Ashes and Diamonds), and a <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> started to develop, but half-hearted democratization was not enough to satisfy the Polish public. By the time of the March 1968 events, Gomułka's thaw would be long over, and increasing economic problems and popular discontent would end up removing Gomułka from power in 1970ironically, in a situation similar to the protests that once had propelled him to power.|$|E
5|$|The {{institutions}} of the ECSC were the High Authority, the Common Assembly, the Special Council of Ministers and the Court of Justice. A Consultative Committee was established alongside the High Authority, as a fifth institution representing <b>civil</b> <b>society.</b> This was the first international representation of consumers in history. These institutions were merged in 1967 {{with those of the}} European Community, which then governed the ECSC, except for the Committee, which continued to be independent until the expiration of the Treaty of Paris in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing global challenges, the UN {{has sought to}} improve its accountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> and fostering a global constituency. In an effort to enhance transparency, in 2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for Secretary-General. On January 1, 2017, Portuguese diplomat António Guterres, who previously served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, became the ninth Secretary-General. Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration, including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts, more effective peacekeeping efforts, and streamlining the organization to be more responsive and versatile to global needs.|$|E

5|$|The Modi {{government}} {{launched a}} crackdown against {{a number of}} <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> organisations. Several {{tens of thousands of}} organisations were investigated by the Intelligence Bureau {{in the first year of}} the administration, on the grounds that they were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.|$|E
25|$|Tocqueville's {{main purpose}} was to analyze the {{functioning}} of political society and various forms of political associations, although he brought some reflections on <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> too (and relations between political and <b>civil</b> <b>society).</b> For Tocqueville as for Hegel and Marx, <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> was a sphere of private entrepreneurship and civilian affairs regulated by civil code. As a critic of individualism, Tocqueville thought that through associating, the coming together of people for mutual purpose, both in public and private, Americans are able to overcome selfish desires, thus making both a self-conscious and active political society and a vibrant <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> functioning according to political and civil laws of the state.|$|E

The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip <b>civil</b> <b>society</b> to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.|$|E
