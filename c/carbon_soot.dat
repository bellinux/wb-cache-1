2500|$|The {{principle}} can {{be shown}} by an early special purpose seismometer. This consisted of a large stationary pendulum, with a stylus on the bottom.

This type of strong motion seismometer recorded upon a smoked glass (glass with <b>carbon</b> <b>soot).</b> While not sensitive enough to detect distant earthquakes, this instrument could indicate the direction of the pressure waves and thus help find the epicenter of a local earthquake – such instruments were useful in the analysis of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Further re-analysis was performed in the 1980s using these early recordings, enabling a more precise determination of the initial fault break location in Marin county and its subsequent progression, mostly to the south.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{some authors}} have {{suggested}} that the absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) can be used to deduce the component aerosol absorption optical depths (AAODs) of carbonaceous aerosols in the AERONET database. This AAE approach presumes that AAE[*]≪[*] 1 for <b>soot</b> <b>carbon,</b> which contrasts the traditional small particle limit of AAE[*]=[*] 1 for <b>soot</b> <b>carbon.</b> Thus, we provide an overview of the AERONET retrieval, and we investigate how the microphysics of carbonaceous aerosols can be interpreted in the AERONET AAE product. We find that AAE[*]≪[*] 1 in the AERONET database requires large coarse mode fractions and/or imaginary refractive indices that increase with wavelength. Neither of these characteristics are consistent with the current definition of <b>soot</b> <b>carbon,</b> so we explore other possibilities for the cause of AAE[*]≪[*] 1. AAE is related to particle size, and coarse mode particles have a smaller AAE than fine mode particles for a given aerosol mixture of species. We also note that the mineral goethite has an imaginary refractive index that increases with wavelength, is very common in dust regions, and can easily contribute to AAE[*]≪[*] 1. We find that AAE[*]≪[*] 1 can not be caused by <b>soot</b> <b>carbon,</b> unless <b>soot</b> <b>carbon</b> has an imaginary refractive index that increases with wavelength throughout the visible and near-infrared spectrums. Finally, AAE is not a robust parameter for separating carbonaceous absorption from dust aerosol absorption in the AERONET database...|$|R

50|$|Uncatalyzed {{combustion}} in air requires {{fairly high}} temperatures. Complete combustion is stoichiometric {{with respect to}} the fuel, where there is no remaining fuel, and ideally, no remaining oxidant.

Thus, the produced smoke is usually toxic and contains unburned or partially oxidized products. Any combustion at high temperatures in atmospheric air, which is 78 percent nitrogen, will also create small amounts of several nitrogen oxides, commonly referred to as , since the combustion of nitrogen is thermodynamically favored at high, but not low temperatures.
