40|$|A novel general {{approach}} was described to address {{many of the}} challenges of salt solubility determination of drug substances, with data processing and refinement of equilibrium constants encoded in the computer program pDISOL-XTM.  The new approach was illustrated by the determinations of the solubility products of diprenorphine hydrochloride, <b>codeine</b> hydrochloride and <b>phosphate,</b> lidocaine hydrochloride and phosphate at 25 oC, using a recently-optimized saturation shake-flask protocol.  The effects of different buffers (Britton-Robinson universal and Sörensen phosphate) were compared.  Lidocaine precipitates were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and polarization light microscopy. The ionic strength in the studied systems ranged from 0. 25 to 4. 3 M.  Codeine (and possibly diprenorphine) chloride were less soluble than the phosphates for pH > 2.  The reverse trend was evident with lidocaine.   Diprenorphine saturated solutions showed departure from the predictions of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation in alkaline (pH > 9) solutions, consistent {{with the formation of}} a mixed-charge anionic dimer...|$|R

25|$|The racemic parent {{compound}} racemorphan was first {{described in a}} Swiss and US patent application from Hoffmann-La Roche in 1946 and 1947, respectively; a patent was granted in 1950.

40|$|Introduction: Among several {{biosensing}} approaches, electrochemical-based {{procedures have}} been described {{as one of the most}} common and useful methods for sensing because of their simplicity, sensitivity, accuracy, and low cost. The electroactive species, which called redox, play a main role in the electrochemical-based approaches. Of several redox molecules used for electrochemical experiments, ferrocene is one of the commonly used redox molecules. However, instability of ferrocenium ion in the chloride containing solutions appeared to be weakness of this redox molecule limiting its utilization. Methods: In the current study, Juglone was attached (using EDC/NHS coupling method) to the 3 '-amino-modified terminus of the immobilized specific aptamer of codeine, which was successfully used in a cyclic electrochemical voltammetry procedure. Results: The cyclic voltammogram peak of aptamer-attached Juglone was observed in the potential range of + 0. 4 to + 0. 9 V and the fabricated aptamer-based sensor was used for detection of different concentrations of <b>codeine</b> in the <b>phosphate</b> buffer 0. 1 M solution containing 2 M NaCl. Conclusion: Based on these findings, it can be suggested that the new aptamer-attached Juglone could be considered as an effective alternative redox molecule in particular with oligonucleotide-based sensing systems...|$|R
