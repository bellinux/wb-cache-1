5|$|Addressing the mercantilist {{belief that}} {{monetary}} intervention {{could cause a}} perpetually favourable balance of trade, Cantillon developed a specie-flow mechanism foreshadowing future international monetary equilibrium theories. He suggested that in countries with a high quantity of money in circulation, prices will increase and therefore become less competitive in relation to countries {{where there is a}} relative scarcity of money. Thus, Cantillon also held that increases in the supply of money, regardless of the source, cause increases in the price level and therefore reduce the <b>competitiveness</b> of a particular nation's industry in relation to a nation with lower prices. However, Cantillon did not believe that international markets tended toward equilibrium, and instead suggested that government hoard specie to avoid rising prices and falling <b>competitiveness.</b> Furthermore, he suggested that a favourable balance of trade can be maintained by offering a better product and retaining qualitative <b>competitiveness.</b> Cantillon's preference towards a favourable balance of trade possibly stemmed from the mercantilist belief in exchange being a zero-sum game, in which one party gains at the expense of another.|$|E

5|$|Another {{option would}} be to {{implement}} fiscal devaluation, based on an idea originally developed by John Maynard Keynes in 1931.

5|$|Since September 2014, several journalists, {{commentators}} {{and financial}} sector insiders have again raised {{the prospect of}} further currency war. This time, rather than being intended {{as a means to}} boost <b>competitiveness,</b> some states, especially Japan and the Eurozone, may be motivated to devalue their currencies as a means to counter the threat of deflation. ECB President Mario Draghi has however denied any intent to engage in competitive devaluation.|$|E

5|$|The <b>competitiveness</b> of {{the teams}} {{continued}} the following year.

5|$|The drop in export {{is caused}} by the loss of <b>competitiveness</b> against other major export {{countries}} including Japan and Germany, where the currency had been drastically devalued during the previous quantitative easing operations.
