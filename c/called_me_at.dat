60|$|Eliz. [in a low voice]. Through the {{stifling}} room Floats strange perfume; Through the crumbling thatch The angels watch, Over the rotting roof-tree. They warble, and flutter, and hover, and glide, Wafting old sounds to my dreary bedside, Snatches of songs which I {{used to know}} When I slept by my nurse, and the swallows <b>Called</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> day-dawn from under the eaves. Hark to them! Hark to them now-- Fluting like woodlarks, tender and low-- Cool rustling leaves--tinkling waters-- Sheepbells over the lea-- In their silver plumes Eden-gales whisper-- In their hands Eden-lilies--not for me--not for me-- No crown for the poor fond bride! The song told me so, Long, long ago, How the maid chose the white lily; But the bride she chose The red red rose, And by its thorn died she. Well--in my Father's house are many mansions-- I have trodden the waste howling ocean-foam, Till I stand upon Canaan's shore, Where Crusaders from Zion's towers call me home, To the saints who are gone before.|$|E

5000|$|When {{asked about}} the song in an interview, Vedder stated it was about [...] "a life fast." [...] Vedder about [...] "In Hiding":The song was about taking a fast from life, doing {{anything}} to get yourself {{back in touch with}} something real. Abstinence from anything is cool, because the normalcy of life is deceptive: It's enjoyable for a while, and there are good moments, but sometimes that's not enough. You start questioning what's the point. By not opening my mouth I was able to get into that state. Jack <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the end of it; he couldn't understand what I was saying.

[...] "I thought at one point I had lost him to Texas-El Paso, but he <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> home {{and asked if he}} could still come to Northeast Missouri," [...] Sloan recalled. [...] "I cannot begin to describe how awesome Lenvil was in his first full contact scrimmage as a freshman. I knew then that he was special, and in my playing career at Missouri I had not seen a better back in The Big 8. Lenvil could do it all.

The idea was to keep it really artistic. Heath was basically running around directing the shots… it was a really cool day. Every day I count my blessings that he directed this piece of art. It was a song I was proud to have written but I never expected to have such an immense video made for it.

5000|$|How {{and when}} the term New Journalism began {{to refer to a}} genre is not clear. Tom Wolfe, a {{practitioner}} and principal advocate of the form, wrote in at least two articles in 1972 that he had no idea of where it began. Trying to shed light on the matter, literary critic Seymour Krim offered his explanation in 1973."I'm certain that Pete Hamill first used the expression. In about April of 1965 he <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> Nugget Magazine, where I was editorial director, and told me he wanted to write an article about new New Journalism. It was to be about the exciting things being done in the old reporting genre by Talese, Wolfe and Jimmy Breslin. He never wrote the piece, so far as I know, but I began using the expression in conversation and writing. It was picked up and stuck." ...|$|E

5000|$|During {{his tenure}} with Jackson, Buxer would {{contribute}} to the soundtrack for the 1994 Sega Genesis video game Sonic the Hedgehog 3. At {{least two of the}} tracks featured in the game were instrumental versions of tracks recorded by Buxer and Jackson, including the later Jackson single [...] "Stranger in Moscow", used over the ending credits, and the then-unreleased 1981 Jetzons song Hard Times, used as background music for the stage [...] "IceCap Zone". Additionally, the background music for the game's Carnival Night Zone stage incorporated elements of Jackson's 1991 song [...] "Jam". [...] "I've never played the game so I do not know what tracks on which Michael and I have worked the developers have kept, but we did compose music for the game. Michael <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> the time for help on this project, and that's what I did. And if he is not credited for composing the music, it's because he was not happy with the sound coming out of the console.

5000|$|Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the Corregidor {{had prior}} {{experience}} navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines {{had been in}} place since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel as they had in days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the Corregidor sailed close to the island of Corregidor {{to pass through the}} channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army's Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could pass through the minefield. A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active. [...] "The Army and the Filipino skippers had long been butting heads. All the channels out of Manila Bay had been mined for many months. At this time, the mining was strictly up to date and operational. At 1 AM on 16 December, the SS Corregidor, carrying 760 refugees, attempted to go thru the minefield without asking clearance. This request would have been granted. The Lieutenant who was on watch in the mine casement, on sighting the SS Corregidor called his superior, who in turn, called the seaward defense commander, Col. Bunker, requesting information as to whether he should de-activate the contact mines in the channel. With a lifetime of experience with the Filipino, going back to the '98 Insurrection, Col. Bunker said 'No!' My first knowledge of this affair came when my duty watch <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> 12:55 AM. The Corregidor had struck one of our mines and in the four or five minutes it took to reach my battery command post, the vessel had sunk. ... Thereafter, we had no trouble with unauthorized Filipino boats attempting to traverse the channel" [...] Captain George Steiger: A POW Diary http://www.fsteiger.com/gsteipow.html When the Corregidor entered the minefield, there was a large explosion on the starboard side of the vessel. The overcrowded ship quickly began to sink, with many people trapped below-deck. Survivors stated that the ship sank so quickly that {{there was no time for}} large-scale panic to set in. Searchlights from Corregidor Island illuminated the scene which aided the rescue effort. Sailors of MTB Squadron 3 posted at Sisiman Cove heard the explosion and left on three PT boats (PT-32, PT-34 and PT-35) to investigate. When the boats arrived they found survivors in the water and were able to retrieve 282 survivors. Seven of the rescued passengers later died from their injuries.|$|E
40|$|Eight years ago, I was peacefully {{practicing}} medicine, {{doing my}} best to {{serve the needs of}} my patients, believing myself to be in compliance with all laws and ethical standards. Since then, I have been learning first hand about the operations of our criminal justice system. Arrested On Dec 12, 2001, I was overwhelmed by the intimidating sight of 40 agents of the U. S. government invading my office, two with revolvers in their hands. They were executing a search warrant obtained for alleged fraud based on affidavits from two perjurers. Although I knew I was not committing fraud, or any other crime, I could not prove at that time that the affidavits were perjured. But when no fraud could be found, Assistant U. S. Attorney (AUSA) Mary Houghton, assistant to prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan, changed the pretext for their investigation to “sex for drugs. ” The entire nightmare was devastating to me. However, I continued to practice as before, and my patients continued to seek my care, maintaining their faith in me, a trust for which I will forever be thankful. My lawyers attempted to determine what Houghton and Buchanan thought was criminal in my medical practice. I asked for and received help from AAPS, the Pennsylvania Medical Society, and the University of Pittsburgh, where my teaching appointment was renewed even after my conviction. Slowly, over the next 18 months, mining my files, the government selectively entrapped four more witnesses against me. A total of five desperate patients were confronted with a choice: they could face lengthy prison terms, or they could lie about me and thereby obtain leniency for themselves. One witness even <b>called</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> breakfast, while my wife was listening, and apologized for having to make a deal; then she asked if she could return as a patient when everything was over!

Biera came from the Scottsdale Unified School District where he spent 14 years. He had been at Central for just six months.
