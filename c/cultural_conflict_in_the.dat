40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the changes in the perceptions of a selected group of Mexican and Japanese foreign students regarding own culture, target culture, and belief system over a time of sojourn in the United States. The total population of this study included 120 Japanese and Mexican students at the University of Arizona and at Pima College, Tucson, Arizona. The students were divided into six equal cells of twenty according to nationality and length of sojourn. The instrumentation employed in this study included: The Cultural Literacy Inventory, Rokeach Dogmatism Scale E, and a personal questionnaire. The following independent variables were also introduced into the study: age, sex, marital status, mobility of residence, past cross-cultural contact, and level of English proficiency. The following independent variables were identified as significant in affecting the target culture perceptions of the students: length of sojourn, sex, marital status in combination with nationality, age, residential mobility from house to house and level of English proficiency. The following independent variables were identified as significant in affecting the own cultural perceptions of the students: length of sojourn in its effect on the intragroup homogeneity of the Mexican students only, and level of English proficiency in its effect on the intragroup homogeneity for both nationalities. The following independent variables were identified as significant in affecting the degree of openness of belief system: nationality, age, residential mobility from house to house in combination with nationality, residential mobility from town to town in combination with nationality, and level of English proficiency. It was predicted that the Mexican students would face more <b>cultural</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> areas of Interaction, Association, Subsistence, Temporality, and Learning.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{examines}} {{an example}} of <b>cultural</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of a whale tourism project in northern Norway. The project has caused conflict since foreign entrepreneurs and their sponsors have moved in with the explicit purpose of {{putting an end to}} whaling by various means of changing the whalers ’ and local people’s conception about whales. It is argued in this paper that the reason behind the introduction of the project follows an increasing ideological trend in the Western world today: the non-consumptive utilization of whales. This idea rejects whales as a fishery resource in favour of developing an emotional and recreational relationship towards them {{and at the same time}} helping unemployed whalers. The entrepreneurs have thus tried to transform “the Whale ” from within the traditional cultural context in northern Norway by introducing an alien image of it as something humans are only supposed to consume by nonmaterial means. Finally, it is concluded that the entrepreneurs have not succeeded in changing either local attitudes towards whales or the economic situation for the whalers, since whaling and other coastal communities in northern Norway show a high degree of cultural resistance...|$|E
40|$|Scientific {{progress}} in the life sciences {{is dependent on the}} governance of tensions between the economic potential of the innovation and the cultural response from society. Ownership of the scientific innovation through patenting is a necessary part of the realization of its economic value yet, in the case of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) science, ownership of the human body and human life may offend fundamental cultural values. In the case of transnational patenting governance by the European Patent Office (EPO) and the European Union (EU), cross-national <b>cultural</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of hESC science has produced a political demand for a form of governance that can incorporate ethical as well as economic judgements in its decision making. This paper explores how bioethics has responded to this opportunity to establish itself as a form of expert authority for the negotiation and resolution of the cultural conflict. In so doing, it shows how the political struggle that has accompanied this bid for new governance territory has been influenced both by the political tensions between the EPO and EU systems of patenting governance and the resistance of competing experts in law and science to a bioethical presence...|$|E

This paper investigates how students are prepared for collaborative learning in three New Zealand tertiary institutes and identifies the particular problems experienced by Chinese students when the preparation in multi cultural classes is not carried out adequately and does not address cultural issues. An initial research project by Clark and Baker (2006) involved a survey of staff and students at two Wellington tertiary institutes The results indicated that students were often inadequately prepared for working in groups and, although they usually valued informal collaborative learning, they did not achieve the desired outcome of learning to work together constructively and cooperatively in assessed collaborative assignments. This paper, which reports on a follow up research project, presents findings from focus groups with Chinese international students and with New Zealand tertiary lecturers who use collaborative learning techniques in their teaching. The findings from these focus groups indicate that there is a strong <b>cultural</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conceptualisation of collaborative learning between Chinese students with little prior experience of collaborative learning and New Zealand lecturers who are often not fully prepared to help Chinese students t...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{analyzes}} <b>cultural</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Asia {{with particular}} emphasize on Southeast Asia. <b>Cultural</b> <b>conflict</b> {{is defined as}} those domestic, inter-state or transnational politi-cal <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> actors involved focus on issues relating to religion, language and/or historicity. The statistical analysis and the assessment of individual cases in this paper substantiate a number of conclusions. First, by global comparison, Asia is a region particularly prone to conflicts. Second, domestic conflicts about identity and especially historicitary <b>conflicts,</b> predominate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. Third, <b>the</b> landscape of <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> Asia is characterized by pronounced domestic conflicts of low intensities over identity. Fourth, <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Asia are shaped by the dominance of "ethnic " actors. <b>In</b> recent decades <b>the</b> relevance of left-wing actors has declined, whereas the impor-tance of religiously defined actors has increased. Fifth, compared {{with the rest of}} Asia, Southeast Asia is subject to a disproportionally large number of cultural con-flicts. At the same time, however, {{it is important to note}} that in Southeast Asia there is no trend of further culturalization of <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> recent years. Rather, <b>the</b> identity <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia seem to be very profound and as such are frequently quite resistant to de-escalation strategies.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examines}} Muslim religious practices in Australian workplaces {{to determine whether}} these practices cause <b>cultural</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace, identifies the main problems faced by Muslim workers, and investigates managers’ responses to these issues. Originality: This is the first empirical study about religious diversity (primarily Muslims) in Australian workplaces that examines the conflict claimed in news reports and some literature and examines diversity polices at different levels. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data consist of an online survey and in-depth interviews with Muslim employees and their managers. A literature review, diversity polices, and government reports are used as secondary data. Findings: Although the researcher has not yet finished collecting the primary data, some findings have emerged: Muslim employees in the case study believe that religious conflict prevents them from practicing {{their faith in the}} workplaces—for whatever reasons—or forces them to attend events that do not fit their faith; Unlike what is documented in the literature, for example, “Muslim employees in non-Muslim countries such as Australia are facing some restrictions in expressing their faith in the workplace,” Muslim employees in the case study currently do not face restrictions in the expression of their faith. There was no clear conflict, even though all of them described themselves as practicing Muslims, because managers have provided accommodation and, along with Muslim employees, consider religion a private matter. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{study will}} examine the factors that {{contribute}} to conflict between Muslim employees and their non-Muslim managers, specifically in relation to Muslim religious practices in the workplace. Originality: (Key Literature and theoretical perspective) Studies have made positive contributions to our understanding of issues relevant to Islam, HRM and discrimination against Muslim workers in the workplace. There is yet to be a study that explicitly identifies the key religious practices enacted by Muslim employees in the workplace and managers’ response to these practices which might have potential for conflict and be difficult to manage. Failure to recognise the impact of external factors on organisational culture, such as culture and social identity, still exists in the literature, in particular consideration of the direct effect of religion on workers. The classic approach, such as that presented by Hofstede (1980), is seen as too simplistic and outdated because the future of such research must combine and consider connected research areas which are the concepts of culture, social identity theory, managing diversity, and the concept of cultural conflicts which will be investigated in this research. Methodology: Cultural studies need both quantitative and qualitative research methods. 200 surveys will be conducted to find out What are the key religious practices of Muslim workers that cause <b>cultural</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace. In-depth interviews also will be used to know how do managers respond to these religious practices. This study will be in western countries, especially Australia, the USA and the UK. 1 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{interface}} {{between religion and}} politics has become strong {{in the wake of}} expansion of modernity in its contemporary form. This can be regarded as cultural globalization. To interpret this phenomenon, the demonization of Islam by the West led by the US has been taken as a key epistemological point. This article argues that this policy, framed as part of the American strategy in the global war on terrorism, has constituted a key component of the larger US agenda. One facet of this agenda is primarily related to America’s bid to per-petuate the institutional structure of the permanent war economy envisaged during the Cold War period. The structure consists of the vocational inter-ests of the arms lobby and the hawkish politico-bureaucratic-strategic con-dominium in the US. To accomplish this goal, communism, the United States’ Cold War enemy, {{has been replaced by a}} new enemy, Islam, at the end of the Cold War. The events of 11 September 2001 brought all this to a full circle and facilitated the US to advance justifications for continuing the permanent war economy and to substantiate the transformation of the ideological conflict of the Cold War into a <b>cultural</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-Cold War period. In this regard, the rise of US soft power, made possible by the pervasive impact of globalization, has helped defend America’s post-Cold War proposition regard-ing an emergent war culture and the portrayal of Islam as the Manichean other in this war...|$|E

The second stage from the 1980 s to the present, motivated by a political, cultural, and literary agenda, witnessed a systematic publication of her works and a massive body of criticism that covers her novels, literary theory, and feminism. Its focus gradually changed from an analysis of her writing techniques to an exploration of the theme and ideas of her works. Woolf s canonical status is well established in China. ...|$|R

Yet {{there is very little}} written about these Native American women teachers, how they view themselves, and their relationship to their professional teaching careers throughout history. In addition, historical accounts on Native education are often inaccurate, disrespectful, and biased. To address issues about Native American women teachers, a qualitative study was conducted to determine the elements in their lives that influenced them to select elementary school teaching as a career choice, and to identify and examine the common patterns and similarities within those elements. The research documented the key elements for success of Native American female teacher including (a) a supportive family, (b) mentoring and positive role models for young Native American girls in elementary and secondary school is vital to their continuing onto higher education, and (c) a strong sense of cultural identity. Five Native American women elementary public school teachers in a large southwestern city, representing four different tribes, participated in individual in-depth interviews to gather information regarding what elements in their lives lead them to educational success. Two had taught in the public school system for more then 20 years, the other three had been in the classroom for less then five years. The research revealed that Native American mothers today are the most influential family members in terms of their daughters educational success in elementary and secondary school, along with being the primary factor in providing moral support during their college years.

40|$|This study explores Carson McCullers’ novel The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (1940) {{in order}} to {{determine}} 1) the text’s relationship to cultural measures for identity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930 s and 40 s American South and 2) the categorization of the novel as a Southern Gothic novel. <b>The</b> novel depicts <b>cultural</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South and presents an intimate perspective of the corruption and prejudices between members of the southern community. Southerners <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novel fall into adopting ideal standards for race, gender, and class, judging and determining how people in different levels of each should act within the community. These culturally imposed identities ultimately result in alienation and individual loneliness, which causes those alienated to desperately struggle in defining their own identities and to create purposes and goals that they can worship. This study also defines the key elements of Southern Gothic literature {{in order to}} ascertain Heart’s placement within this category, seeing how the novel both matches the standard elements and utilizes them in a unique way. Additionally, in order to supplement previous scholarship on the novel, this study develops the particular area of the novel’s depiction of racism and the struggle to leave segregation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past and progress into a future consisting of respect and unification amongst the entire southern community. This research finds that the intimate cultural perspective <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Heart Is a Lonely Hunter and its presentation of grotesque characters ultimately communicates that alienated people are not rightly labeled as ‘freaks,’ but that the southern society’s imposed identity standards for gender, race, and class are a grotesque measurement of the individual value of unique people.
