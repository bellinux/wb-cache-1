25|$|It is {{not known}} how many panels made up the {{original}} altarpiece, or how they were arranged. A total five is considered the most likely number, which would allow for four wings and a larger <b>center</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Prairie Queen block {{combines}} {{two large}} scale triangles {{in the corner}} section with the middle section using four squares. The <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> is one full size square. Each of the nine sections does have the same overall measurement and fits together.|$|E
25|$|Akeley began {{collecting}} specimens for the hall {{as early as}} 1909, famously encountering Theodore Roosevelt {{in the midst of}} the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African expedition (two of the elephants featured in the museum’s <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> were donated by Roosevelt, a cow, shot by Roosevelt himself, and a calf, shot by his son Kermit). On these early expeditions, Akeley would be accompanied by his former apprentice in taxidermy, James L. Clark, and artist, William R. Leigh.|$|E
50|$|The Pyramorphix can {{be rotated}} around three axes by {{multiples}} of 90°. The corners cannot rotate individually {{as on the}} Pyraminx. The Pyramorphix rotates {{in a way that}} changes the position of <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> not only with other <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> but also with corner pieces, leading to a variety of shapes.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{variations}} of the Professor's Cube {{have one of the}} <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> marked with a logo, which can be put into four different orientations. This increases the number of permutations by a factor of four to 1.13×1075, although any orientation of this piece could be regarded as correct. By comparison, the number of [...] atoms in the observable universe is estimated at about 1080. Other variations increase the difficulty by making the orientation of all <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> visible. An example of this is shown below.|$|R

25|$|The huipil is a tunic-like garment made by {{stitching}} together anywhere {{from one to}} five pieces of cloth. The most common fiber is cotton, but there are those made from wool and silk as well. Most huipils are made from two or three pieces, which are usually the same size, with one exception being those from the highlands of Chiapas, where the <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> is wider than the side ones. The panels are not sewn together in the normal sense with seams but rather they are joined using ribbons, small strips of cloth or complicated stitching which has {{the edges of the}} panels touching or almost touching. This adds a layer of decoration to the garment.|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} been used as a tool for {{analysis}} on a number of issues. In September 2008, Slate published an article that interpreted The Big Lebowski as a political critique. The <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> of this viewpoint was that Walter Sobchak is [...] "a neocon", citing the film's references to then President George H. W. Bush and the first Gulf War.|$|E
500|$|Bosch painted {{three large}} triptychs (the others are The Last Judgment of c. 1482 and The Haywain Triptych of c. 1516) {{that can be}} read {{from left to right}} and in which each panel was {{essential}} to the meaning of the whole. Each of these three works presents distinct yet linked themes addressing history and faith. Triptychs from this period were generally intended to be read sequentially, the left and right panels often portraying Eden and the Last Judgment respectively, while the main subject was contained in the <b>center</b> <b>piece.</b> It is not known whether [...] "The Garden" [...] was intended as an altarpiece, but the general view is that the extreme subject matter of the inner center and right panels make it unlikely that it was intended to function in a church or monastery, but was instead commissioned by a lay patron.|$|E

50|$|The V-Cube 5 mechanism, {{designed}} by Panagiotis Verdes, has elements {{in common with}} both. The corners reach {{to the center of}} the puzzle (like the original mechanism) and the <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> hold the central edges in place (like the Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and creating arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle. Unlike the original 5×5×5 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed with speedcubing in mind.|$|R
50|$|When {{twisting}} the puzzle, a 180° turn exchanges two corner pieces and swaps {{two pairs of}} face <b>center</b> <b>pieces,</b> but preserves the cube shape. The entire puzzle can be scrambled in this way.|$|R
2500|$|One {{end of the}} yarn {{is wound}} around the <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> and held firmly in place, {{while the rest of}} it is wrapped. The yarn is then taken over the left end of the top {{crossbar}}, down and under {{the right side of the}} lower crossbar, up and over the other end of the top crossbar, and [...] then down and under the other end of the lower crossbar before returning to the starting point to complete one wrap. While rather awkward at first, one quickly picks up the rhythm.|$|E
2500|$|The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is the <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> of {{environmental}} {{legislation in the}} Australian Government. It sets up the “legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places”. [...] It also focuses on protecting world heritage properties, national heritage properties, wetlands of international importance, nationally threatened species and ecological communities, migratory species, Commonwealth marine areas, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and the environment surrounding nuclear activities. Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983), {{also known as the}} [...] "Tasmanian Dam Case", is the most influential case for Australian environmental law.|$|E
2500|$|While {{conducting}} the drop, the C-123 {{was shot down}} by a Sandinista soldier, using a SA-7 Grail. CIA pilots Wallace [...] "Buzz" [...] Sawyer and William Cooper {{were killed in the}} crash. Loadmaster Eugene Hasenfus parachuted to safety and was taken prisoner. He was later released in December 1986. The Fairchild C-123 that was shot down in Nicaragua remains there. Its sister ship, also a Fairchild C-123 that was purchased by the CIA {{at the same time as}} the first one, was then left abandoned at San Jose International Airport for a time and then was purchased for $3,000 and disassembled into 7 pieces and transported via boat to Quepos, Costa Rica and then reassembled and is now the <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> of a beachside cocktail lounge just up the road from Manual Antonio national park.|$|E
50|$|Slice : The four <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> {{and four}} edge pieces between two {{opposite}} {{layers of the}} cube. On a cube with four or more layers, it refers {{to any of the}} layers of the puzzle that don't have corner pieces.|$|R

50|$|One of the <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> {{is marked}} with a V, which distinguishes it from the other three in its set. This {{increases}} the number of patterns {{by a factor of}} four to 6.29×10116, although any of the four possible positions for this piece could be regarded as correct.|$|R
2500|$|The {{hospital}} contacted design firm, , with {{studios in}} Indianapolis and Vancouver, BC, to start development on this sculpture and {{other pieces of}} art inside the IU Simon Cancer Center in 2004. Led by principal designer and 2nd Globe Studio co-founder Jeff Laramore, the firm submitted design intention documents in August 2005. [...] Local companies were contracted to supply the materials and fabrication. [...] 2nd Globe staff assembled the sphere's superstructure, an acrylic globe with internal supports and lighting attachments. [...] The Santarossa Mosaic and Tile Company (http://www.santarossa.com/idex.htm) of Indianapolis supplied the selected onyx stone, cutting each piece, applying the stones to the sphere and then grinding, polishing and installing the sphere on site. [...] Scenic View, Inc. of Chicago fabricated the curved walls under the artist's direction. [...] The <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> of the sculpture, the stone sphere, was installed in August 2008.|$|E
2500|$|An {{elaborate}} four-day event {{called the}} [...] "Golden Spike Days Celebration" [...] {{was held in}} Omaha, NE, from April 26 to 29, 1939, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the joining of the UP and CPRR rails and driving of the Last Spike at Promontory Summit, UT, in 1869. The <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> event of the celebration occurred on April 28 with the World Premiere of the Cecil B. DeMille feature motion picture Union Pacific which took place simultaneously in the city's Omaha, Orpheum, and Paramount theaters. The film features an elaborate reenactment of the original Golden Spike ceremony (filmed in Canoga Park, CA) as the motion picture's closing scene for which DeMille borrowed the actual Golden Spike from Stanford University to be held by Dr. W.H. Harkness (Stanley Andrews) as he delivered his remarks prior to its driving to complete the railroad. (A prop spike {{was used for the}} actual hammering sequence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{an unusual}} move for the 1950s, the 1951 Imperial had noticeably less chrome than the lower-priced New Yorker {{that it was}} based on. It also had three {{horizontal}} grille bars with the parking lights between the bars and a chrome vertical <b>center</b> <b>piece.</b> Aside from its front fender nameplate, side body trim {{was limited to the}} moldings below the windows, rocker panel moldings, bright metal stone shields and a heavy horizontal molding strip running across the fender strips. Three 2-door bodystyles were added to the Imperial model in 1951: a Club coupe, a hardtop and a convertible. Only 650 convertibles were sold and it would be discontinued the following year. 1951 was also the year that Chrysler introduced its [...] Hemihead V8. [...] "Hydraguide" [...] power steering, an industry first for use in production automobiles, became available on the Imperial for an additional $226. Full-time power steering was standard on the Imperial Crown [...]|$|E
50|$|However, {{if there}} were no means of {{identifying}} the orientation of those pieces, the number of combinations would be reduced. There would be 8! ways to arrange the pieces, divided by 24 to account for the lack of <b>center</b> <b>pieces,</b> and there would be 34 ways to rotate the four pyramidal pieces.|$|R
50|$|Tony Fisher has {{produced}} a shape modification of the Megaminx into a cube form which he called the Hexaminx. Another variant is the Holey Megaminx, which has no <b>center</b> <b>pieces,</b> like the Void Cube. It is being produced by Mèffert as of July 2009.Other variants include the Flowerminx, Megaminx Ball, and Crazy Megaminx.|$|R

2500|$|Manson {{stated in}} a 2004 {{interview}} with i-D magazine {{to have begun}} {{his career as a}} watercolor painter in 1999 when he made five-minute concept pieces and sold them to drug dealers. On September 13–14, 2002, his first show, The Golden Age of Grotesque, was held at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Centre. Art in Americas Max Henry likened them to the works of a [...] "psychiatric patient given materials to use as therapy" [...] and said his work would never be taken seriously in a fine art context, writing that the value was [...] "in their celebrity, not the work". On September 14–15, 2004, Manson held a second exhibition on the first night in Paris and the second in Berlin. The show was named 'Trismegistus' which was also the title of the <b>center</b> <b>piece</b> of the exhibit – a large, three-headed Christ painted onto an antique wood panel from a portable embalmers table.|$|E

25|$|The Neuchatel {{exhibition}} also pushed Al-Zahawi to {{test the}} bounds of physics by constructing much larger pieces. He endured a number of setbacks in the process where he created pieces that were too large to transport, bake (fire), and exhibit. After several attempts, he discovered that by creating the sculptures in two parts, one fitting inside the other for balance, he could build sculptures of the height and magnitude he hoped. The result: The Three Warriors, each over 6 feet tall, which became the <b>center</b> <b>pieces</b> that anchored the Neuchatel exhibition.|$|R
