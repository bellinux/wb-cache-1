5|$|During Danny Williams' time as premier the {{province}} experienced a major economic expansion, mainly {{as a result}} of the offshore oil industry. After years of sluggish growth and annual deficits {{the province}} started recording large surpluses, starting in 2006. While billions of dollars were paid down on the province's debt, government spending increased considerably. In his 2011 report Auditor General John Noseworthy noted that spending had increased by 47.4 percent over a five-year period. Finance Minister Tom Marshall defended the spending practises by saying that the province had to play <b>catchup</b> after decades of deficits, and that the global recession forced all governments to hike spending to keep economies afloat.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the work done}} to add hot standby replication functionality to the Apache Derby Database Management System. The Apache Derby project is a relational database implemented entirely in Java. Its key advantages are {{that it has a}} small footprint and {{it is based on the}} standard Java JDBC and SQL standards. It is also easy to install, deploy and use as well as it can be embedded in almost any light-weight Java application. By implementing a hot standby scheme in Apache Derby several features are added. The contents of the database is replicated at run time to another site providing online runtime backup. As the hot standby takes over on faults availability is added in that a client can connect to the hot standby after a crash. Thus the crash is masked from the clients. In addition to this, online upgrades of software and hardware can be done by taking down one database at the time. Then when the upgrade is completed the upgraded server is synchronized and back online with no downtime. A fully functional prototype of the Apache Derby hot standby scheme has been created in this project using logical logs, fail-fast takeovers and logical <b>catchups</b> after an internal up-to-crash recovery and reconnection. This project builds on the ideas that are presented in Derby: Write to Neighbor Mode. </p...|$|R

25|$|The word {{entered the}} English {{language}} in Britain {{during the late}} 17th century, appearing in print as <b>catchup</b> (1690) and later as ketchup (1711). The following {{is a list of}} early quotations collected by the Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eve of}} war 14.6 million German {{women were}} working, with 51% of women of working age (16–60 years old) in the workforce. Nearly six million were doing farm work, as Germany's {{agricultural}} economy was dominated by small family farms. 2.7 million worked in industry. When the German economy was mobilized for war it paradoxically led to a drop in female work participation, reaching a low of 41% before gradually climbing back to over 50% again. This still compares favorably with the UK and the USA, both playing <b>catchup,</b> with Britain achieving a participation rate of 41% of women of working age in 1944. However, in terms of women employed in war work, British and German female participation rates were nearly equal by 1944, with the United States still lagging. The difficulties the Third Reich faced in increasing {{the size of the}} work force was mitigated by reallocating labor to work that supported the war effort. High wages in war industries attracted hundreds of thousands, freeing up men for military duties. Prisoners of war were also employed as farmhands, freeing up women for other work.|$|E

A couple music critics from Singles Jukebox noted that FEMM were more widely noticed by Western {{audience}}s than the audience from Japan or J-pop culture.

Major labels are slow to embrace streaming services. Japan’s iTunes store is a wealth of anison, electro and pop but only a small fraction of that is available globally."
