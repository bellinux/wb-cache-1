Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked if there was anything he could do for her, to which she replied, [...] "Is there anything we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you?</b> For you are the one in trouble now!" ...|$|E

Ross photographed all the series' sets as reference footage to work from in case a visual effect shot was ultimately required, explaining, [...] "Sometimes while looking at the assembly I’ll realize we need another shot but there isn’t any coverage that works. [...] us a starting point for building our new shots. And whether they are all-CG or just elements, we are always dealing with Noah’s aesthetic of making it look as real as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Seacole visited Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital in Scutari, {{where she}} asked for a bed for the night, because she {{intended}} to travel to Balaclava {{the next day to}} join her business partner. In her memoirs, she reported that her meeting with Nightingale was friendly, with Nightingale asking [...] "What do you want, Mrs. Seacole? Anything we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you?</b> If it lies in my power, I shall be very happy." [...] Seacole told her of her [...] "dread of the night journey by caique" [...] and the improbability of being able to find the Hollander in the dark. A bed was then found for her and breakfast sent her in the morning, with a [...] "kind message" [...] from Mrs. Bracebridge, Nightingale's helper. A footnote in the memoir states that Seacole subsequently [...] "saw much of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava," [...] but no further meetings are recorded in the text.|$|E

2500|$|Bow Wow had {{publicly}} {{announced his}} interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated {{in an interview with}} MTV: [...] "Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These are the things I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Let me hold you down. This is what I want to do for you as a man. These are the things I'm capable of doing for you if you get with me. Just hear me out.' I'm just really talking to the ladies.
