5|$|Cather's {{letter to}} Anderson {{can only be}} paraphrased by scholars, because she left a clause in her will forbidding the {{publication}} of her letters and private papers.

5|$|Some Bach {{scholars}} {{believed that}} the cantata was written in 1734 {{for the end of}} the War of the Polish Succession, but the discovery of the printed text showed that it was not related.

5|$|The cantata was {{edited by}} Franz Wüllner for the Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe, the first <b>complete</b> <b>edition</b> of Bach's works, in a volume {{published}} in 1887. The New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, NBA) published the score {{of both the}} Weimar and the Leipzig version in 1982, edited by , with the critical commentary following in 1984.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} publication, the Cantiones {{appeared}} {{as part of}} a <b>complete</b> <b>edition</b> of the composer's works by Breitkopf & Härtel, begun by Philipp Spitta, who published a first volume in 1885, and completed by Arnold Schering and Heinrich Spitta in 1927. This edition was faithful to keys and clefs, a problem for modern performers. In 1960, Gottfried Grote published the collection in the Neue Ausgabe, transposing and with modern meter signs. A critical edition was published in 2004 by Bärenreiter, edited by Heide Volckmar-Waschk, who uses modern clefs, but shows the original clefs and retains the keys and note values.|$|E

50|$|Given {{that the}} {{programmes}} were pre-shot on film {{as opposed to}} being shown live, unlike most of the BBC's output from the late 1940s, examples of Television Newsreel do survive in the archives, some of the oldest extant pieces of BBC-produced television programming. <b>Complete</b> <b>editions</b> with the original linking narration are rare, however, as the individual reports were designed to be re-used in shows such as Newsreel Review of the Week and the end-of-year review Scrapbook, so reports were archived separately rather than as <b>complete</b> <b>editions</b> of the programme.|$|R
5|$|On May 14, 2013, Random House Audio {{released}} a lengthier audiobook titled World War Z: The <b>Complete</b> <b>Edition</b> (Movie Tie-in Edition): An Oral History of the Zombie War.

5|$|The {{music of}} two of the cantata's {{movements}} was published in the 18th century: an organ transcription of the duet was published around 1748 as one of the Schübler Chorales, and the closing chorale was included in C.P.E. Bach's 1780s collection of his father's four-part chorales. The entire cantata was published in the first volume of the 19th-century first <b>complete</b> <b>edition</b> of Bach's works. In 20th- and 21st-century concert and recording practice the cantata is often combined with other German-language cantatas, but also several times with settings of the Latin Magnificat, by Bach and other composers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the post-war}} period, editions have moved {{increasingly}} {{to reflect the}} performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 <b>complete</b> <b>edition</b> which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra. In the 21st century editions continue to be produced, often for use {{in conjunction with a}} particular performance or recording.|$|E
5|$|The Mozarts {{arrived in}} Milan on 23 January and found {{comfortable}} lodgings in the monastery of San Marco, {{not far from}} Count Firmian's palace. While they waited to see the Count, they attended Niccolò Piccinni's opera Cesare in Egitto. Firmian eventually welcomed them with generous hospitality and friendship, presenting Wolfgang with a <b>complete</b> <b>edition</b> {{of the works of}} Metastasio, Italy's leading dramatic writer and librettist. Firmian also hosted a series of concerts attended by many of the city's notables, including Archduke Ferdinand, a possible future patron for the young composer. For the last of these occasions, Wolfgang wrote a set of arias using Metastasio's texts. These were so well received that Firmian commissioned Wolfgang to write the opening opera for the following winter's carnival season in Milan, just as Leopold had hoped he might. Wolfgang would receive a fee of around 500florins, and free lodgings during the writing and rehearsal. The Mozarts left Milan on 15 March, heading south towards Florence and Rome, committed to return in the autumn and taking with them fresh letters of recommendation from Firmian.|$|E
5|$|The fourth edition, {{published}} in 1769, {{is the first}} <b>complete</b> <b>edition</b> in one volume and had hard covers. He added footnotes to make certain issues clearer. In this edition he also added several of his own philosophical essays and completed the volume with an index. The fourth edition was a book volume with hard covers that {{increased the number of}} pages from 154 to 496. Franklin added papers on his lightning rod invention, meteorological observations, human nature, worldwide population increase, waterspouts, experiments on amber, and information on his Pennsylvania fireplace invention. This edition had copper plate illustrations of his lightning rod design, new fireplace, and electrical experiments. The fifth English edition was {{published in}} 1774. There was little difference between the fourth edition and the fifth edition. The only new document added in the fifth edition, that was not in the fourth edition, was the French experiment with lightning done in 1752. There was an advertisement in the Public Advertiser London newspaper of September 9, 1774, that promoted the fifth edition.|$|E
