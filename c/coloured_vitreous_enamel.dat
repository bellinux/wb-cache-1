This is a joint venture company, owned 50% by Tolent, 33% by 42nd Street Realty Ltd and 17% by Closegate. Initially there had been plans to call the building and station the Haymarket Hub, however this now appears just to be {{the name of the}} building, with the station's Haymarket name remaining. Reid Jubb Brown were architects, with Arup as consulting engineers. Newcastle-based creative communications agency Gardiner Richardson and artist Lothar Goetz, a lecturer at Sunderland University, worked on passenger areas. Gardiner Richardson's work centred on updating Metro brand elements in the station, including the colour palette and signage, and Nexus sees this as a blueprint for other station modernisations within its £300 million Metro: All Change modernisation programme. Lothar Goetz created an artwork 'Canon' using different <b>coloured</b> <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> panels in the concourse, escalator shaft and platform areas.|$|E
40|$|My practice-led {{and studio}} based {{research}} has investigated how {{the presence of}} everyday, commonplace objects, such as buttons and handles, can be revealed through their reinterpretation into conceptual abstracted forms, and by the application to these forms of alternative vitreous materials. It has explored {{the creation of a}} hybrid substance made from vitreous enamel plus ceramic slip, mixed and applied to a metal substrate. This research has followed a reflective, heuristic approach of learning by doing, where one action leads to the next, exploring conceptual and technical aspects of my practice. I have investigated methods of making, together with exploring conceptual and formal qualities, to draw the hidden, unnoticed presence of these simple, familiar objects into the viewer&rsquo;s consciousness. The use of <b>coloured</b> <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel,</b> and stains in painting medium have provided me with a vivid and vibrant palette as a means of bringing metal and ceramic materials to life. The technical aspect of the inquiry has focused on investigating and testing the compatibility of metal, ceramic and vitreous material to create a new viable, surface finish. This new hybrid surface detail enabled me to create a strong, textured, surface treatment that may stimulate the viewer&rsquo;s curiosity to pick the object up, sense the weight, and to touch and feel the surface, and through that the form of the conceptual object. Through studio practice, I have explored the work of contemporary enamelling artists {{as well as that of}} artists from a wider art field, specifically sculpture, painting and installation practice. I have examined their approaches to making, use of materials, colour, form, size and proportion in relation to my own research, methods and practice...|$|E

There is no generally accepted definition or standard for use of the term enamel paint, and not all enamel-type paints may use it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> is a glassy coating {{formed on}} a metal {{substrate}} by firing at temperatures above 800 °C. The quality of <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> coating depends on the pre-treatment of the steel substrate surface {{and the quality of}} enamel slip. The main aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the composition of the steel substrate surface after firing with double finish, to explain the effect of steel substrate surface pre-treatment (blasting, acid pickling) on forming the phase interface of the steel substrate – vitreous coating system, and on its final microhardness, fracture strength and the adhesive properties of the coating. To achieve these aims, the following experimental methods were used: Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron analyzer, and EDAX. Based on the chemical composition of the initial enamel slip and the firing technology, the metal- enamel system interface exhibited various ratios of layers of magnetite, hematite, nonstoichiometric wüstite, and crystals of faylite. The measuring results indicate that the quality and age of enamel slip influences the brittle fracture properties of <b>vitreous</b> <b>enamel</b> coating...|$|R

You’ve probably seen the stuff: tables, saucepans, jugs, kettles …and exterior murals with enamel’.
