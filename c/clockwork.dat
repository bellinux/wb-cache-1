40|$|<b>ClockWorks</b> is a {{programming}} environment supporting the visual programming of object-oriented software architectures. In developing <b>ClockWorks,</b> we used user interface evaluation techniques, including heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthrough and user evaluation. The development of <b>ClockWorks</b> {{was based on}} a task analysis of <b>ClockWorks</b> programmers. This task analysis revealed that programmers work incrementally. Incremental development implies the need for good support for information filtering and for easy refinement and restructuring of programs. <b>ClockWorks</b> has been implemented, and runs on Sun workstations. All examples shown in this paper were programmed with <b>ClockWorks.</b> Keywords: Visual Programming, User Interface Architectures. 2 1 Introduction In 1991, we began a project to develop tool support for programming component-based software architectures, with the particular application domain of software architectures for graphical user interfaces.

5|$|The clock dial {{has been}} dated {{to either the}} {{building}} phases of 1405 or 1467-83, or to {{the installation of the}} Brunner <b>clockwork</b> in 1527-30. Ueli Bellwald notes that the planisphere uses a southern projection, as was characteristic for 15th-century astronomical clocks; all later such clocks use a northern projection. This would seem to confirm the dating of the clock to the 1405 or 1467/83 renovations.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to <b>clockwork.</b> The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed <b>clockwork</b> machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E

5|$|While Moffat was {{creating}} the <b>clockwork</b> automata he first decided {{to hide their}} faces with wigs, but when producer Phil Collinson told him this would severely limit camera angles, {{and that it could}} appear comical, the androids were given carnival masks to wear.

5|$|Back on the ship, the Doctor and {{his companions}} find several {{additional}} time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour's life. In one of them, the Doctor sees another <b>clockwork</b> creature menacing her and steps through the window to defend her. The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders, and it obeys her. It tells her {{that it is a}} repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm. The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts. The androids need one last part; Reinette's brain. Confused, the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette, but is startled to find that she can also see into his mind. The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them. The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette's life at the age of 37, believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship's systems. The <b>clockwork</b> androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage. At one end of the room is an enormous mirror, which is actually a time window. The Doctor {{and his companions}} can see through it, but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor's previous interruptions.|$|E
5|$|Besides <b>clockwork,</b> hydraulic-powered armillary spheres, odometers, and {{mechanical}} compass vehicles, {{there were other}} impressive devices of mechanical engineering found during the Song dynasty. Although literary references for mechanical revolving repositories and book cases of Buddhist temples trace back to at least 823 during the Tang dynasty, they came to prominence during the Song dynasty. The invention of the revolving book case is considered to have happened earlier, and is credited to the layman Fu Xi in 544. Revolving bookcases were popularized in Buddhist monasteries during the Song dynasty under the reign of Emperor Taizu, who ordered the mass printing of the Buddhist Tripiṭaka scriptures.|$|E
