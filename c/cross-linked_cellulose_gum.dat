40|$|Industrial {{flax yarn}} can be {{successfully}} cross-linked with citric acid by thermal treatment or by microwave irradiation. Both the methods {{were applied to}} an industrial yarn, exactly as it is produced and commercialized. Treatments were run on 100 - 200 g of yarn spinned on polypropylene cones, i. e. common industrial textile supports. The proposed cross-linking of flax cellulose with citric acid affords a new cross-linked flax yarn, ready to produce new materials of industrial applications, {{in relationship to the}} introduced cross-linkage. The new yarn maintains the morphology of the fiber and the textile potentiality of the flax itself and moreover it can be further modified, due to the presence of the citric acid functional group. The bond between cellulose and citric acid is an ester bond, of general interest for polysaccharides. Nevertheless, this bond is critical for the textiles, as it can be broken by high temperature and hydrolyzed in basic media, typical of washing operations.

40|$|The {{primary cell}} walls of growing and fleshy plant tissue mostly {{share a common}} set of {{molecular}} components, cellulose, xyloglucan (XyG), and pectin, that are required for both inherent strength and the ability to respond to cell expansion during growth. To probe molecular mechanisms underlying material properties, cell walls and analog composites from Acetobacter xylinus have been measured under small deformation and uniaxial extension conditions as a function of molecular composition. Small deformation oscillatory rheology shows a common frequency response for homogenized native cell walls, their sequential extraction residues, and bacterial cellulose alone. This behavior is characteristic of structuring via entanglement of cellulosic rods and is more important than cross-linking with XyG in determining shear moduli. Compared with cellulose alone, composites with XyG have lower stiffness and greater extensibility in uniaxial tension, despite being highly cross-linked at the molecular level. It is proposed that this is due to domains of <b>cross-linked</b> <b>cellulose</b> behaving as mechanical elements, whereas cellulose alone behaves as a mat of individual fibrils. The implication from this work is that XyG/cellulose networks provide a balance of extensibility and strength required by primary cell walls, which is not achievable with cellulose alone...|$|R

The fact that formation of plaques by previously uncommitted cells {{is related to the}} life of the leukocytes, and is complement dependent brings evidence that we are dealing with an immunological phenomenon. Puromycin suppresses the formation of plaque. Previous incubation of the PC with SRBC in liquid medium, before incorporation in the detection system, reduces the lag in the production of plaques. This indicates that a phase of stimulation precedes the phase of expression (manifested by plaque formation). The immunological activity of the peritoneal cell suspension is highly dependent on the concentration of the suspension, which indicates that this activity results from a cooperative process. Actinomycin D, which does not suppress the production of plaques by cells from immunized animals, stops completely the in vitro induction.

40|$|The loaded salts (NaCl, KCl, MgCl₂, and CaCl₂) have {{significantly}} different {{influence on the}} contribution of dehydration and depolymerization reactions to the decomposition of sugar structures during cellulose fast pyrolysis at 325 °C. The structures of salt-loaded <b>celluloses</b> already become <b>cross-linked</b> during heating-up period, {{largely due to the}} enhanced dehydration reactions catalyzed by inorganic species. As stronger Lewis acids, the alkaline earth metal ions (Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺) are more effective than the alkali metal ions (Na⁺ and K⁺) to catalyze the dehydration reactions of sugar structures, leading to the formation of more <b>cross-linked</b> <b>cellulose</b> for the alkaline earth metal chloride-loaded celluloses. As a result, the majority of Mg and Ca are transformed into water-insoluble forms during the heating-up period, largely reducing the catalytic effects of these species on the dehydration of sugar structures during the subsequent isothermal pyrolysis. Rather, the dehydration of non-sugar structures is enhanced because the catalytic species are already bonded with non-sugar structures. In contrast, the dehydration of sugar structures during the heating-up period is less significant for the NaCl-loaded and KCl-loaded celluloses. The majority of Na and K are water-soluble after the heating-up period so that the dehydration of sugar structures is further enhanced during isothermal pyrolysis. The loaded salts have less influence on the depolymerization reactions.
