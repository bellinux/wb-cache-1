5000|$|The van {{included}} a trailing-arm {{rear suspension system}} incorporating springs in the cross bar assembly. The modern layout featured a prewar two-cylinder 700 cc two-stroke engine of the DKW F8 rated at 20 hp (22 hp after 1952). In 1955 the van received the DKW F9's three <b>cylinder</b> <b>unit</b> with 900 cc, producing [...]|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a 2620 cc four <b>cylinder</b> <b>unit</b> for which (after {{a few months}} of {{heightened}} optimism) the manufacturer quoted a maximum output of [...] at 2,800 rpm. This converted into a listed top speed of 85 km/h (53 mph) on the standard length car, and 80 km/h (50 mph) on the heavier long wheel base version.|$|E
5000|$|The Komsomolyets {{took its}} name {{from that of the}} Young Communists youth {{organisation}} Komsomol. It was designed to test the suitability of the GAZ-M-60 engine for light aircraft use. The M-60 was developed from the Ford derived engine used in the GAZ-M1 motor-car and was a [...] water-cooled, upright four <b>cylinder</b> <b>unit</b> and as a result the G-23 had a radiator protruding beneath its nose and a low set propeller.|$|E

50|$|The SAME 240 was {{launched}} in 1958. This {{was known as the}} 'intelligent tractor', as it was equipped as standard with the innovative S.A.C. ('Stazione Automatica di Controllo' - 'Automatic Control Station') lower hitch arm draft control system conceived by SAME, which would be implemented across the entire range over the following years. This tractor was powered by a 42 HP two <b>cylinder</b> <b>unit,</b> with 6 forward speeds, one reverse speed and a top speed of 28.9 km/h.|$|E
50|$|All Series 71 engines use uniflow scavenging, where a gear-driven Roots type blower {{mounted to}} the {{exterior}} of the engine provides intake air through cored passages in the engine block and ports in the cylinder walls at slightly greater than atmospheric pressure. The engine exhausts through pushrod-operated poppet valves in the cylinder head(s), with either two or four valves per <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Unit</b> injection is employed, one injector per cylinder, with no high fuel pressure outside of the injector body. The injectors are cycled from the same camshaft responsible for opening the exhaust valves.|$|E
50|$|The car {{had much}} in common with the company’s Type 63 from 1904, sharing its 2100 mm {{wheelbase}} with the shorter “63A” version of that car. The principal difference was the engine which on the Type 99 was a single <b>cylinder</b> <b>unit</b> of 1039 cc delivering a maximum of 9 hp. The position of the engine, ahead of the driver, followed what had by now become the Peugeot standard lay-out as did the transmission of power to the rear wheels by means of a rotating steel drive shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Unusually, the Renault 21 {{was offered}} with {{disparate}} engine configurations. The 1.7 litre version featured a Transverse engine, but Renault had no gearbox {{suitable for a}} more powerful transverse engine: accordingly, faster versions featured longitudinally mounted engines. The two versions featured (barely perceptibly) different wheel bases: the engines were all relatively compact four <b>cylinder</b> <b>units</b> and the engine bay was large enough to accept either configuration without reducing passenger space.|$|R
5000|$|All the petrol engines {{comply with}} the Euro 5 norm and the diesel engines have [...] {{emissions}} of 99 g/km or lower. In addition to the four cylinder petrol engines carried over from the previous model, from September 2012, the 208 has been offered with two new three <b>cylinder</b> <b>units</b> with variable valve timing - the 1.0 VTi (68 hp) and 1.2 VTi (82 hp).

As the major Japanese motorcycle manufacturers, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha, began replicating each others designs, the UJMs created a homogeneity of form, function and quality. UJMs included such prominent models as the Honda CB500, the Kawasaki Z1, and the Suzuki GS750. Such machines had massive sales, and UJMs {{continued to be}} produced {{for more than a}} decade, with some examples like the CB750 Nighthawk continuing into 2003.|$|E
5000|$|... 2014: Changes to the American market NMS Passat for 2014 {{include the}} engine upgrade {{of the aging}} in-line 5 {{cylinder}} being replaced by a modern 1.8 liter turbo charged in-line 4 cylinder; Volkswagen says it is gradually phasing out the 2.5-liter 5 <b>cylinder</b> <b>unit</b> altogether. The new engine delivers 170 horsepower and 184 pounds-feet of torque. Compared to the 2.5-liter, horsepower is the same, but the 1.8 offers a bit more torque. Fuel-economy offers significant highway fuel mileage gains over the 2.5-liter unit. The 2014 Passat also now uses electro-mechanical steering, instead of the previous hydraulic setup.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1930s Train {{introduced}} {{a series of}} air-cooled, inverted in-line piston engines for light aircraft. The T series all used the same cylinders, pistons, connecting rods, valve trains and ignition system, combined into 2 (2T), 4 (4T), and 6 (6T) <b>cylinder</b> <b>units</b> of the same layout. The number of crankshaft bearings (3, 5 or 7) and throws (2, 4 or 6) naturally depended {{on the number of}} cylinders, as did the number of cams (4, 8 or 12) on the underhead camshaft. Each cylinder had a swept volume of 0.5 L, so the displacements were 1 L, 2 L and 3 L and the rated outputs , [...] and [...] respectively. The Train 6D was a variant of the 6T with increased bore of 85 mm.|$|R
5000|$|While {{there were}} some {{significant}} exterior alterations, the big change was under the bonnet {{where there was a}} result of more than two years technical collaboration between BMC and Rolls-Royce. The aluminium Rolls-Royce FB60 engine was a short-stroke version of the Rolls-Royce Military B: 4, 6 and 8 <b>cylinder</b> <b>units</b> of which more than 30,000 had already been produced. The 6-cylinder engine weighed only 450 lb. Its cubic capacity was 3.909 L. Over-square: bore was 95.25 mm, stroke 91.44 mm; with a 7.8:1 compression ratio its output was [...] @4,800 rpm. Twin SU carburettors were fitted. Both block and head were aluminium, tappets were hydraulic self-adjusting operating on overhead inlet and side exhaust valves. The counterbalanced crankshaft ran in seven bearings.|$|R
50|$|The Australian Repco V8 F1 engine being {{based on}} Buick 215 block is {{technically}} a common misconception, as the Rover/Buick V8 had only 5 cylinderhead studs around each <b>cylinder</b> <b>unit</b> and that cannot accommodate the 6 stud Repco RB620 heads. The Repco V8 {{was based on}} Oldsmobile 215 block of the same era, which was very similar in appearance, size and material, but used 6 cylinderhead studs per cylinder. The subtle difference in block design/head clamping originated in Oldsmobile's intention to produce the higher power, turbo-charged Jetfire version of the small/light V8, however, the public/press tended not {{to be aware of}} the internal difference.|$|E
5000|$|Plans existed {{to launch}} the car with an ohc 2120-cc (12CV) four <b>cylinder</b> <b>unit</b> {{designed}} by the manufacturer’s own engineer whose name was Grillot, an engine which would have produced the same peak power.

50|$|The Rebell had low-mid set wings {{built around}} a single wooden spar and wood covered. They had {{dihedral}} only on the outer panels, each 3.75 m (12 ft 3.5 in) long and foldable for storage. The fuselage was a steel tube structure, wood covered and had a roughly rectangular cross-section. The canopy was quite long and normally enclosed just a single seat, but there was space to place a second seat in tandem behind the first. The engine, originally a 40 kW (54 hp) Hirth M28 twin <b>cylinder</b> <b>unit,</b> was placed over the wing behind the cockpit with the propeller shaft {{at the top of}} the fuselage, locating the propeller just behind the trailing edge of the wing. Aft, the fuselage became a low-set boom, bearing wooden tail surfaces including a swept, straight edged vertical tail with a long dorsal fillet. The Rebell had a recessed monowheel undercarriage assisted by a tailwheel and two stabilizing wheels mounted at the extreme inner wing panels.|$|E
