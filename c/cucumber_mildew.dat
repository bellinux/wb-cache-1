40|$|Abstract. Cucumber, {{a common}} {{economic}} crop, occupies {{a large proportion}} of vegetable cultivation in China. Plant diseases and insect pests, especially the <b>cucumber</b> downy <b>mildew,</b> are important causes for the decrease in the yield of cucumbers. In order to reduce the losses caused by pests and diseases and achieve rapid automatic identification of plant diseases and insect pests, this paper studies machine vision system and disease image detection with support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm, taking <b>cucumber</b> downy <b>mildew</b> for example. This paper carries out a method study in image acquisition, image preprocessing, feature parameter extraction, and pattern recognition, which obtains satisfactory results. The accuracy of <b>cucumber</b> downy <b>mildew</b> detection reaches 90 %, significantly higher than that of artificial recognition...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHyperspectral imaging technology, {{which can}} {{integrate}} {{the advantages of}} spectral detection and image detection, meets the need of detecting the cucumber diseases fast and nondestructively. In this paper, hyperspectral imaging technology is adopted to detect the <b>cucumber</b> downy <b>mildew</b> fast and nondestructively. Firstly, hyperspectral images of cucumber leaves infected downy mildew are acquired by the hyperspectral image acquisition system. And optimum wavelengths are collected by the principal component analysis to get the featured images. Then the image fusion technology is adopted to combine collected images with the featured images to form new images by pixel-level image fusion. Finally, the methods of the image enhancement, binarization, corrosion and dilatation treatments are carried out, so the <b>cucumber</b> downy <b>mildew</b> is detected. The result shows that the accuracy rate of the algorithm for detecting cucumber disease can reach nearly 90 %. Studies have shown that hyperspectral imaging technology {{can be used to}} detect <b>cucumber</b> downy <b>mildew...</b>|$|R

Cultivars resistant to downy mildew {{have been developed for}} cucumber and cantaloupe {{and to a lesser extent}} for squash and pumpkin.

40|$|The {{ability of}} Verticillium lecanii (Lecanicillium muscarium; B- 2) to induce host {{resistance}} and defense responses against subsequent challenge with <b>cucumber</b> powdery <b>mildews</b> was examined in a glasshouse. A root test showed that, after inoculation with V. lecanii blastspore on cucumber roots, induction of systemic resistance in those V. lecanii pre-inoculated plants engendered significantly fewer lesions and reduced disease severity compared with non-inoculated plants. Furthermore, in plants inoculated with V. lecanii blastspore on their roots, the fungi showed high colonizing ability on cucumber rhizoplane and inside root tissues. Nevertheless, activities of peroxidase (PO) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) increased slightly, but not significantly. In a leaf test of inoculation with V. lecanii, activity of PAL tended to increase when powdery mildew was inoculated, but the PO activity {{did not change}} significantly. These results indicated that an isolate of V. lecanii (B- 2) potentially induced host resistance to cucumber and is an effective candidate for biological control of <b>cucumber</b> powdery <b>mildews,</b> even in inoculation into soil...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate control efficacy of a fermented food ’Cheonggukjang’ against <b>cucumber</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> caused by Sphaerotheca fuliginea in greenhouse. Sterilized Daepung beans were inoculated with the rice straw as natural inoculum and then incubated for 72 hrs at 42 "C in the household cheonggkjang maker. After 72 hrs of cheonggukjang fermentation, white zymogens were grown on the surface of a sterile Daepung beans. The pH of the 72 hrs fermented soybean was not significantly changed and electrical conductivity was found to increase by about 2 times than before fermentation. The population density of soybean zymogen showed a peak of growth at 60 hrs after fermentation and the concentration of zymogen was 8. 2 × 107 cfu/ml. Soybean zymogen form of the colony was divided into three kinds of bacteria and a white and a large colony (WL) was predominant bacteria among those up to 60 hrs of fermentation. To control the <b>cucumber</b> powdery <b>mildew,</b> diluted solutions of cheonggukjang was applied from 6. 0 % to 30. 0 % on cucumber leaves and they showed injury symptoms on cucumber leaves in more than 15 % of them. However, more than 6. 0 % diluted cheonggukjang solutions showed more than 77. 8 % control effect of <b>cucumber</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> at 15 days after treatment. The fermented bacteria of Chenggukjang were well established in the cucumber leaf area at 15 days after treatment. The antifungal activity of 10 % diluted cheonggukjang solutions was excellent for four species of plant fungal pathogens, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Sclerotinia cepivorum, Rhizoctonia sloani and Phytophthora capsici in the dual culture test. Results indicated that foliar application of Cheonggukjang solution could be used for the control of powdery mildews occurring on organically cultivated cucumber...|$|R

40|$|<b>Cucumber</b> (L.) downy <b>mildew,</b> {{caused by}} the obligate oomycete {{pathogen}} (Berk. and Curt.) Rostov., is the primary factor limiting cucumber production. Although sources of resistance have been identified, such as plant introduction line PI 197088, the genes and processes involved in mediating resistance are still unknown. In the current study, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptome and small RNAome analysis of a resistant (PI 197088) and susceptible (‘Vlaspik’) cucumber during a time course of infection using Illumina sequencing. We identified significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes within and between resistant and susceptible cucumber leaves over a time course of infection. Weighted gene correlation network analyses (WGCNA) created coexpression modules containing genes with unique expression patterns between Vlaspik and PI 197088. Recurring data trends indicated that resistance to <b>cucumber</b> downy <b>mildew</b> is associated with earlier response to the pathogen, hormone signaling, and regulation of nutrient supply. Candidate resistance genes were identified from multiple transcriptome analyses and literature support. Additionally, parallel sequencing of small RNAs (sRNAs) from cucumber and during the infection time course was used to identify and quantify novel and existing microRNA (miRNA) in both species. Predicted miRNA targets of cucumber transcripts suggest a complex interconnectedness of gene expression regulation in this plant–pathogen system. This work bioinformatically uncovered gene expression patterns involved in the mediation of or response to resistance. Herein, we provide the foundation for future work to validate candidate resistance genes and miRNA-based regulation proposed in this study...|$|R
5000|$|Chemical Control - Chemical {{control is}} highly {{recommended}} because downy mildew is an aggressive and destructive disease and satisfactory control {{without the use}} of fungicides is unlikely. Both protectant and systemic products should be applied. Fungicides are most effective when applied prior to infection and reapplied at 5- to 7-day intervals. The following products have proven to be the most effective fungicides in <b>cucumber</b> downy <b>mildew</b> control in North Carolina trials conducted annually from 2004 to 2008: Presidio (fluopicolide, Valent), Ranman (cyazofamid, FMC), Previcur Flex (propamocarb, Bayer), Curzate (cymoxanil, DuPont), Tanos (famoxadone and cymoxanil, DuPont),and Gavel (zoxamide and mancozeb, Dow AgroSciences). These products should be applied in a program to prevent pathogen resistance, that is, rotated with fungicides of a different mode of action. Protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil and mancozeb should be used as mixing partners.|$|R
40|$|An {{early warning}} model for {{occurrence}} of <b>cucumber</b> downy <b>mildew</b> in non-heated greenhouses was developed based on disease records and microclimatic parameter analysis. It also integrated empirical and fundamental forecasting models, early warning theory and {{plant protection product}} risk analysis. The thresholds for infection were a daily temperature range 5 'C, daily mean RH > 80 % and daily mean temperature at 15 - 25 'C in autumn. The temperature contribution rate for symptom appearance {{was measured by the}} reciprocal of the days of the inoculation period and the relationship was fitted by a polynomial of degree 3. Data recorded in two greenhouses were used to construct the model and its predictions were evaluated with an independent dataset.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of Tilletiopsis pallescens, formulated with natural oils on the inhibition of <b>cucumber</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> in greenhouses was investigated. Two foliar sprays of cotton, maize, sunflower or paraffin oil formulations (0. 05 %) of T. pallescens were sprayed on cucumber plants, 30 and 75 days after planting. The oils formulated with T. pallescens improved the biocontrol potential. The most effective treatments were cotton, paraffin and maize oil formulations which enhanced the T. pallescens survival {{and the plant}} protection against the powdery mildew disease incidence. Where, the disease colonies, disease severity and infected leaf areas as well as Sphaerotheca fuliginea sporulation were greatly suppressed. Furthermore, cotton oil formulation of Tilletiopsis isolate exhibited high quantities of chitinase, β- 1, 3 - glucanase, cellulase and protease isozyme bands of cucumber leaves surface after 10 extended to 40 days of application. On the contrast, unamended oil treatments showed moderate isozyme bands activity after 10 days of application {{and then began to}} decline after 40 days of application. Whereas no β- 1, 3 - glucanase or cellulase were detected. At the same time, yield of cucumber plants treated with oil formulations of T. pallescens was significantly higher...|$|R
40|$|Biocontrol of <b>cucumber</b> powdery <b>mildew,</b> Sphaerotheca fuliginea, by Verticillium lecanii {{is seriously}} {{hampered}} at low humidities. The effect is especially marked at low humidity (60 % RH) {{during the three}} hours following the application of V. lecanii spores suspended in water. Formulations of V. lecanii spores in oil might improve the situation. Arachid oil (peanut oil) and two invert emulsions using either Sunspray 6 N or paraffin oil were tested in formulations of V. lecanii spores. Arachid oil gave the best development of V. lecanii on mildewed cucumber leaves. V. lecanii formulated with arachid oil showed significantly better control of mildew than without. A concentration of 0. 5 % arachid oil was somewhat toxic to mildew but 0. 05 % was not. Arachid oil did not show toxicity to V. lecanii. The humidity requirements of V. lecanii formulated with and without 0. 05 % arachid oil were compared at 95, 90 and 85 % RH. Arachid oil significantly reduced the humidity dependence of V. lecanii. Since arachid oil is safe for human consumption and not phytotoxic to cucumber leaves, low concentrations of arachid oil are recommended as an additive to increase the effectiveness of V. lecanii as a biocontrol agent of S. fuliginea...|$|R

The metod showed linearity for all samples and linear correlation coefficient higher than 0. 898. Under the optimized GLC-ECD conditions the retention time of azoxystrobin was 10. 5 min, and LOD was 0. 02 mg/kg.

40|$|In ancient times, {{right after}} {{they started to}} {{domesticate}} plants, humans had to become plant protectors. The first protection strategies were mainly against herbivorous animals of any kind, arthropods as well as vertebrates. Thousands of years later humans discovered microorganisms like bacteria and fungi and soon correlated them with the disease they, their livestock and their plants had to suffer. The control agents they used against plant pests were mainly inorganic substances such as sulfur, arsenic or mercury. Their own diseases, in contrast, were fought with medicinal plants for thousands of years, more or less successfully. After problems caused by chemical pesticides, like DDT, became obvious (enrichment in the food chain and with that in the human tissues as well), the search for alternatives started. In more recent times more and more scientific studies investigate the potential of medicinal plants as plant protection agents. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} potential of ethanolic extract of leaves of the medicinal plant Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) as a control agent against one of the main pests in cucumbers, the Oomycete Pseudoperonospora cubensis (downy mildew). The first question addressed was: Has the licorice extract a potential as alternative control agent, not only in the laboratory, but also under commercial conditions in greenhouses? The second question addressed was: If it shows a potential, what is the active ingredient? And the final question addressed was: What is the mode of action?

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} develop {{integrated}} crop management (ICM) systems in organic greenhouse production for improved control of tomato corky root rot (Pyrenochaeta lycopersici), tomato verticillium wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum), and <b>cucumber</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> (Podosphaera xanthii), compatible with and/or utilizing organic fertility management practices, while minimizing or eliminating permitted practices such as soil disinfection by steaming and foliar application of sulphur fungicide. Different concentrations of chitin (or chitosan -a water soluble form), fresh Brassica tissues, and cow manure based compost applied to soils infected with P. lycopersici alone and P. lycopersici plus V. albo-atrum reduced disease incidence and/or increased yield. However, efficacy differed between treatment types and concentrations. Compost or fresh Brassica tissue significantly increased soil microbial activity which may have increased competition and/or antagonism against soil pathogens, lowering disease incidence. Combining different treatments gave no synergistic or additive effects on incidence of both diseases, but the Brassica tissues plus chitosan combination improved yield. In tests of cultivar resistance/tolerance to the two pathogens, two "standard" cultivars were susceptible to both pathogens whilst the cherry type was tolerant to corky root rot, but not Verticillium. In soils infected with corky root rot only, grafting the cultivars onto a resistant root-stock effectively reduced disease incidence, but when infected with both pathogens, only one "standard" cultivar showed reduced disease incidence. In cucumbers, foliar application of chitosan reduced powdery mildew but Milsana® VP 2002 (a plant extract) was significantly better. Ampelomyces quisqualis and Pythium oligandrum (Biological Control Agents) were ineffective. There was no synergistic or additive effect detected with any combinations. Resistance/tolerance of cultivars significantly affected disease incidence. However, the more susceptible cultivar outyielded the tolerant one despite greater infection.

In greenhouse test, antitranpirants {{proved to be}} effective treatments in reducing disease incidence, severity and pathogen sporulation when applied prior or post to inoculation. Among these compounds, Kaolin and Nu-Film (1. 0 %) were more effective in reducing spores counts, germination and infection as well as downy infected area and lesions number. Scanning electron microscope examination showed that, Kaolin antitranspirant inhibited zoospores germination, growth and development as well as had become collapsed and lost its turgidity when applied either pre or post inoculation. Although, spraying of Bio-Film and Polyacrylamide Anti-Stress 550 antitranspirants, at 1 and 3 %, resulted also in better disease control. Under protected cultivation and natural infection conditions, all antitranspirants showed a remarkable effectiveness on the reduction of disease severity and pathogen density when applied twice at 45 and 75 days after sowing in cucumber leaves. Furthermore, all tested antitranspirants, significantly increased the cucumber plant height and yield. Kaolin strongly protected <b>cucumber</b> against downy <b>mildew</b> and yield increased.

In morphology, those introgression lines were characterized to have small-sized leaf, short fruit, and multi-branching habit which were closer to the wild parent (C. hystrix), {{and to have a}} fertility as high as that of cultivated cucumber.

40|$|Since 2001, several {{isolates}} of Blumeria graminis, {{the causal}} agent of cereal powdery mildew, maintained on detached leaves at the John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK, have spontaneously become infected with an unknown filamentous fungus whose mycelia have quickly overgrown the powdery mildew colonies and destroyed them completely. A total of five isolates of the contaminant were obtained and identified as Paecilomyces farinosus based on morphological characteristics and rDNA ITS sequence data. To determine whether these P. farinosus isolates {{can be considered}} as biocontrol agents (BCAs) of powdery mildews, we studied the interactions between P. farinosus and the following four powdery mildew species: B. graminis f. sp. hordei infecting barley, Oidium neolycopersici infecting tomato, Golovinomyces orontii infecting tobacco and Podosphaera fusca infecting <b>cucumber.</b> The powdery <b>mildew</b> colonies of all these four powdery mildew species were quickly destroyed by P. farinosus in leaf cultures but neither conidial suspensions nor cell-free culture filtrates of P. farinosus isolates could suppress the spread of powdery mildew infections on diseased barley, tomato, tobacco or cucumber plants in the greenhouse. It is concluded that P. farinosus cannot be considered as a promising BCA of powdery mildew infections although it can destroy powdery mildew colonies in detached leaf cultures and can be a menace during the maintenance of such cultures of cereal, apple, cucurbit and tomato powdery mildew isolates...|$|R
40|$|Ergosterol {{biosynthesis}} inhibitors (EBIs) have {{a remarkably}} {{broad spectrum of}} antifungal activity. They belong to the commercial fungicides which exhibit the highest activity known to date. Resistance to EBIs was found in vitro, but the level of resistance and the decreased fitness of resistant strains led to the hypothesis that resistance to EBIs was rather unlikely to develop in practice. Despite the fact that EBIs were introduced as early as 1972, up to 1980 only data on EBI-resistant laboratory strains were available. However, gradually there appeared reports on decreased sensitivity to EBIs in practice. This made it of interest to investigate the potential development of resistance to EBIs in vivo. In this study the pathogen used to gather the desired information was Sphaerotheca fuliginea, as this fungus is widespread in cucumber glasshouses in the Netherlands, intensively controlled with fungicides and resistance-prone. This thesis contains five papers describing several aspects of resistance to fungicides in S. fuliginea. In the first paper {{it has been shown}} that S. fuliginea is present on cucumber plants all year round. A gradual increase in the number of infected crops, in the form of S-shaped curves, was observed from planting until May. In the districts with the highest crop density (Pijnacker), mildew was generally observed early in the growing season, while the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was higher than in other districts. In the district with the lowest crop density (Northern Netherlands), mildew was observed late in the growing season and the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was low. Early in the growing season the pathogen is probably dispersed by transportation of infected planting stock and by man. When the disease pressure increases, inoculum is probably dispersed by wind. This implies that inoculum is highly mobile and that, in the case of development of resistance to fungicides, the resistant strains will disperse to crops where the spray regime did not cause resistance to develop. As S. fuliginea developed resistance to dimethirimol, benzimidazoles and pyrazophos in 1971, 1972 and 1979, respectively, it was thought that presence of strains resistant to these fungicides might provide information on the long-term fitness of these strains. The results of an investigation are presented in the second paper. Strains resistant to these fungicides still persisted in the pathogen population. Although this finding may indicate that the long-term fitness of these strains is equal to that of wild-type strains, several other factors might be involved in the persistence of resistance. From 1981 to 1984, S. fuliginea in the Netherlands was primarily controlled with EBIs. The short-term fitness of isolates of S. fuliginea resistant to EBIs and their behaviour under practical conditions are described in the third, fourth and fifth paper. Several fitness parameters of EBI-resistant isolates collected from commercial glasshouses were compared to those of isolates with a wild-type sensitivity to EBIs. Fitness parameters studied were germination of conidia, growth of germ tubes and mycelium, penetration, sporulation and competitive ability. The results are described in the third paper. One or more values of fitness parameters for EBI-resistant isolates were significantly lower than those for the wild-type isolates. However, in general it was concluded that the fitness of EBI-resistant S. fuliginea isolates, collected in commercial glasshouses, was hardly reduced. Within the group of EBI-resistant isolates tested no significant relation was observed between the degree of resistance to EBIs and the degree of fitness. In the fourth and fifth paper the resistance to EBIs of S. fuliginea over a three-year period has been described. In 1981 the sensitivity of glasshouse isolates to EBIs was lower than that of the wild-type isolates. In 1982 and 1983 the sensitivity decreased further. In 1984, no significant differences in sensitivity with the 1983 level were apparent. Per district, the degree of resistance appeared to be positively correlated to the frequency of application of EBIs. Isolates collected in the district of Limburg, where EBIs were applied less frequently than in the district of Pijnacker, showed a significantly higher sensitivity to EBIs than isolates collected in Pijnacker. Triforine showed a very low efficacy in controlling glasshouse isolates. This is in accordance with the experience of growers who, therefore, only use triforine when the disease pressure is low. It is concluded that the decreased sensitivity to triforine can be regarded as resistance. In the case of bitertanol, fenarimol and imazalil, a change to shorter spray intervals has up till now been sufficient to achieve proper control. Contrary to earlier presumptions that development of resistance to EBIs seemed rather unlikely, it gradually developed in normal commercial practice. The slowly decreasing sensitivity to EBIs of cereal powdery mildew is in line with the results described in this thesis. Strategies to delay resistance to EBIs are necessary. Alternation with other site-specific and multi-site fungicides must be advised and can be applied immediately. Non-EBI fungicides are registered for control of <b>cucumber</b> powdery <b>mildew</b> in the Netherlands. Appropriate information and guidance by extension officers and fungicide manufacturers may lower the reluctance of growers to use these strategies. In the long run, control of S. fuliginea might only be maintained by a form of integrated control, which accepts less than perfect disease control. Biological and chemical control, induced resistance of cucumber plants, epidermal coating and mildew-tolerant cucumber cultivars are elements that may fit into a strategy for integrated control of <b>cucumber</b> powdery <b>mildew...</b>|$|R

The problem of soil desinffection is discusses in detail. Botrytis cinerea is an important problem on tomatoes and partly on cucumbers and lettuce. This infection {{can be reduced to}} great extent by regulating temperature and moisture while spraying plants by benomyl has only a supplementary character. Sclerotinia minor occurs sometime in severe intensity on the tomatoes grown after lettuce. The infection caused by this parasite can be reduced considerably by the application of some systemic fungicides (benomyl BAS 3460). Wilting of tomatoes (Fusarium oxysporum f. lycopersici, Verticillium dahliae), of paprika (Verticillium albo-atrum) and cucumbers (Fusarium spp., Pythium spp.) occurred only on the individual plants probably because the soil desinffection was done well. Slight infection of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum was fond on tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce. Powerdy mildew is the most harmful disease of cucumbers. Sphaeroteca fuliginea and Erysiphe cichoracearum are the most important causers of this disease and Leveillula taurica appears slightly. Systemic fungicdes (benomyl and metil (tiopanat) provide a better control of <b>cucumber</b> against powdery <b>mildew</b> in relation to protective chemicals (morestan and karathane). Powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica) become a very seriuos problem on paprika.
