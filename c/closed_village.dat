5000|$|It was {{for long}} a <b>closed</b> <b>village</b> {{ruled by the}} {{resident}} lords of Stanmer, with a population static at just over 100. From the eighteenth century onwards the lords were the Pelham family who received the title Earl of Chichester in 1801 {{in addition to the}} Baron Pelham of Stanmer they had had since from 1762. They lived in the mansion called Stanmer House, built in its present Palladian form in 1722, a Grade I listed building.

50|$|The {{settlement}} of Khirokitia is {{situated on the}} slope of a hill in {{the valley of the}} Maroni River towards the southern coast of the island about 6 km from the sea. Subsistence methods practiced by its Neolithic inhabitants included farming crops, herding sheep and goats, and raising pigs. It is a <b>closed</b> <b>village,</b> cut off from the outside world, apart from by the river, by a strong wall of stones 2.5 m thick and 3 m at its highest preserved level. Access into the village was probably via several entry points through the wall. The buildings within this wall consist of round structures huddled close together. The lower parts of these buildings are often of stone and attain massive proportions by constant additions of further skins of stones. Their external diameter varies between 2.3 m and 9.20 m while the internal diameter is only between 1.4 m and 4.80 m. A collapsed flat roof of one building found recently indicates that not all roofs were dome shaped as was originally believed.|$|E
5000|$|Following {{the fall}} of Wu and the turmoil of the Wu Hu {{uprising}} against the Jin dynasty (265-420), most of elite Chinese families had collaborated with the non-Chinese rulers and military conquerors in the north. Some may have lost social privilege, and took refugee in areas south to Yangtze River. Some of the Chinese refugees from north China might have resided in areas near Hangzhou. For example, the clan of Zhuge Liang (181-234), a chancellor {{of the state of}} Shu Han from Central Plain in north China during the Three Kingdoms period, gathered together at the suburb of Hangzhou, forming an exclusive, <b>closed</b> <b>village</b> Zhuge Village (Zhege Cun), consisting of villagers all with family name [...] "Zhuge". The village has intentionally isolated itself from the surrounding communities for centuries to this day, and only recently came to be known in public. It suggests that a small number of powerful, elite Chinese refugees from the Central Plain might have taken refugee in south of the Yangtze River. However, considering the mountainous geography and relative lack of agrarian lands in Zhejiang, most of these refugees might have resided in some areas in south China beyond Zhejiang, where fertile agrarian lands and metropolitan resources were available, mainly southern Jiangsu, eastern Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Anhui, and provinces where less cohesive, organized regional governments had been in place. Metropolitan areas of Sichuan was another hub for refugees, given that the state of Shu had long been founded and ruled by political and military elites from the Central Plain and north China. Some refugees from the north China might have found residence in south China depending on their social status and military power in the north. The rump Jin state or the Southern Dynasties vied against some elite Chinese from the Central Plain and south of the Yangtze River.|$|E

40|$|With 14 {{chapters}} {{devoted to}} technical aspects and 8 chapters on social, economic and geographical studies, {{this was the}} first comprehensive historical study of agricultural development in a Dutch province. The study covered the period 1200 - 1900 and focused on the agricultural profession and the prosperity of farmer and farmhand, and not on juridical and political facets as was customary. In contrast to most other agricultural regions of Europe the <b>closed</b> <b>village</b> economy was non-existent through international trade and navigation. Weaving, breweries, madder factories and weekly markets grew up in the villages. New crops were introduced by the impulses of commerce: madder 1380, buckwheat 1485, potatoes, tobacco, hop, cabbage, Jerusalem artichoke in the 18 th century and mangold, sugar-beet, caraway, clover and lucerne in the 19 th century. Cereals, rape-seed, beans and peas were the ancient crops cultivated in a 7 years rotation. The lease period had the same duration. Agriculture was mainly crop growing on the 'wheat system', intensified by the cultivation of flax and madder, requiring deep tillage and abundant manure. Cattle raising was considered only as a necessary evil for getting manure. This agriculture occupied a prominent place in Europe, but measured by our standards the prosperity was unstable, the farmhands were poor and often unemployed. Up to 1870 the farmers were lacking initiative and there was a painful surplus of them and of their labourers. A new era of dynamic progress was opened {{at the end of the}} 19 th century, despite the agricultural crisis, by the introduction of extension, organization, artificial manure and sugar-beet growing, the sugar-beet in place of madder. ...|$|E
40|$|Processes of {{development}} {{in the village and}} in agriculture were often the subject of Edvard Kardelj 2 ̆ 7 s research and ideological-political interest. His studies cover a wide range — from general theoretic questions concerning long-term laws and trends of social development, to the most concrete solutions in everyday practice. Analyzing Kardelj 2 ̆ 7 s work we discover an originality and a search for a specifically Yugoslav path of socialist development. He stressed the role of the subjective factor and of consciously directing developmental changes with the purpose of a socialist transformation of agriculture and the peasantry. Rejecting voluntary constructions, he demanded that the material and technical basis be primarily considered, and also the readiness of the peasant {{to be included in the}} process of such a transformation. As a research worker — both a sociologist and a politician, Kardelj was conscious that the most intense and greatest processes of structural change are today taking place in Yugoslavia. He studied the development of agriculture and the village from the aspect of a dialectic process of the social division of labour. That division shows itself through the breaking up of <b>closed</b> <b>village</b> communities and overcoming the historical remains of economic, cultural and political particularism, which hampered the development of a national and global market of high productivity. The same basic objective can be felt in Kardelj 2 ̆ 7 s work; it shows itself both in a clear consciousness of long-term laws {{of development}}, and in a firm resolution that the socialist policy in the village must not be founded on state pressure, but on an economic and political alliance with peasants. Theoretically Kardelj interpreted the general social development through a complete system of free and associated labour, within which the peasantry also have their place and perspective. He showed the importance of the Yugoslav concept of personal material interest of the working people, of material stimulation for greater work productivity and of the role of market production both in agriculture, and in the Yugoslav economic system in general. Kardelj took into account the actual dynamism of changes in development, which take place in the wide span between the conservative inclinations of the peasants and voluntary radicalism, which can be felt from time to time in desires to change certain conditions in short-term campaigns. Kardelj considers both unacceptable, stressing that agriculture and the village cannot develop without a plan; he thus emphasizes the role of subjective forces in changing relationships in the village, and takes into account the readiness of the peasants themselves to join programmes of development. All Kardelj 2 ̆ 7 s discussions about agriculture and the vilage contain reflections on the necessity of socializing the production process. Kardelj does not follow any dogmas that have already been determined, but searches for the forms and means of that socialization in the experience given by Yugoslav practice, or that in other socialist countries. Today cooperatives link peasants with the socialized sector, coordinating the individual interest of farmers with the collective interest of Yugoslav socialist development. According to Kardelj, cooperatives are the simplest form of a link with the socialist economic system. They can serve as a basis for more progressive socialist forms of agricultural production and as an impulse of progress in agriculture. The basic means of production play a decisive role, while the role of land ownership decreases with the increase of the volume of modern socialized agricultural production within the process of production. Thus socialism’s true economic power in agriculture does not lie in the percentage of collectivized land, but in a greater work productivity in the socialized than in the private sector. Kardelj’s work reveals a constant factor — a clear long-term objective, the socialist transformation of the village and agriculture. As Kardelj himself finds, the Associated Labour Act also did not introduce a completely novel concept, but only strengthened and supplemented Yugoslavia’s permanent orientation...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} three aproaehes to rural {{planning}} are analysed: as planning of non-urban areas, as planning {{of the villages}} and its environment, and finally rural planning integrated into the national economic structure. The first approach {{is based on the}} high degree of planibilitv of land because of its unlimited duration, its irreproducibility and divisibility. This is the approach mainly used in physical planning of rural areas, in planning of land use, in planning land reforms, in dealing with the use of water, and in forestry. In the second approach there is consideration of the village as a rural nucleus, of the rural area gravitating to it, and of inter-rural vaccuums with no settlements. Planning of this kind is found in the following cases: traditional three-field cultivation, the <b>closed</b> <b>village</b> community system, based an irrigation schemes or animal husbandry relying on open fields, common pastures and forests. It is also found in the transformation of villages from agricultural production units into service centers; in farm consolidation schemes; in the cooperative organization of villages following the principle »one village — one cooperative«; in the organization of kolkhozes; in community development planning etc. The third approach to rural planning is based on integrative planning of the socio-economic structure. Rural activities are a component part of social life, and this has to be remembered in rural planning. Rural activities need to be built into the general frame of society, {{in the form of the}} interdependent action of many centers of activity and social decision making. The basic underlying fact is that economic development leads to an ever greater specialization of production and diversification of consumption in such a way that the former is increasingly locally bound whereas the latter is more and more freed from locality. This disequilibrium is the main obstacle which rural planning has to overcome. The magnitude of the task arises from the immobility and indivisibility of the factors of production, the magnitude of the spatial units under consideration and of the level of their economic development. Increase in agricultural production changes the relation between auto-consumption and the local, regional, national and international markets. The absolute figures present a somewhat different picture. Auto-consumption does not change considerably in value, and increase of production is mainly due to access to ever greater markets. Nevertheless this tendency is neither radial nor symmetrical. The interdependence is measured with the aid of input output matrices. In spite of the integrative progress the author believes that rural planning ought to preserve its identity as a special kind of planning for the following reasons: the specific character of land; the fact that the location of activities in rural areas follows different rules from that in urban settlements; there is a difference in the degree of local determination of socio-economic activities which is greater in rural than in urban areas; disequilibrium is greater in the country than in town because of greater specialization of production and less diversification of consumption; there is a greater density of population, of traffic of goods and of capital outlay per area unit in urban than in rural areal. The aims, the actors and instrument of rural planning are analysed. Emphasis is laid on the problem of price parity, income parity and the equal opportunity of mobility, in both the horizontal and vertical sense. The idea that rural planning is an instrument of the urbanization of rural areas is rejected as both areas are subject to changes under the influence of the same forces. Rural planning has to deal with natural and economic risk. It acts as a socialized reductor of uncertainties, as a form of generalized market research, and a universal social insurance scheme. It is optimal when organized in a polycentric way. Finally the size of different social groups carrying out various social activities is discussed...|$|E
