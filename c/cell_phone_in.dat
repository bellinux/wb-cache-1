5|$|At the FBI, Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) {{discloses}} {{to a room}} {{of agents}} that Dana Scully’s (Gillian Anderson) son William has been abducted. Follmer notes that The Lone Gunmen are identifying the woman who took the child and ran over John Doggett (Robert Patrick). However, Follmer leaves out any potential motive for these crimes, which causes a frustrated Scully to leave the room. Byers (Bruce Harwood) reveals that he put a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> the baby’s belongings so they can track the Overcoat Woman; Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Scully head out to find William. The two eventually find William's car seat along with the <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> an abandoned SUV. Meanwhile, the Overcoat Woman reports to Josepho that she has William.|$|E
5|$|One {{ordinary}} day, 19-year-old Mercer White (Lou Taylor Pucci) steals a Volvo {{station wagon}} {{from a car}} wash, and leaves Eugene, Oregon to find his estranged half-brother Arlen, who is unaware that their mother has recently died.

5|$|In Tallahassee, Florida, on December 21, 1999, a {{memorial}} service is held for a former FBI agent named Raymond Crouch. His widow is approached by a mysterious man, Mark Johnson (Holmes Osborne), {{who claims to have}} worked with her husband. After the other mourners have left, Johnson returns to the funeral parlor, dons the corpse's clothes, and places a <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> the coffin. One week later, Johnson is monitoring Crouch's grave when his phone rings; he walks towards the grave with a shovel. Subsequently, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called in to examine Crouch's empty grave. They notice damage done to the interior of the casket; Scully theorizes that the scene was staged. A briefing is held by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who notes that Crouch is one of four former FBI agents whose graves have been exhumed; all four men had committed suicide. Because of the presence of goat's blood encircling the grave, Mulder states that the crime was an act of necromancy. After the briefing, Skinner takes the agents aside and asks them to investigate Crouch's possible ties to the Millennium Group, which is now dissolved.|$|E
5000|$|In {{mathematics}} and logic, a vacuous truth {{is a statement}} that asserts that {{all members of the}} empty set have a certain property. For example, the statement [...] "all <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> the room are turned off" [...] will be true whenever there are no <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> the room. In this case, the statement [...] "all <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> the room are turned on" [...] would also be vacuously true, as would the conjunction of the two: [...] "all <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> the room are turned on and turned off".|$|R
40|$|Abstract / In {{this article}} I examine the {{deployment}} of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> two different contexts. The first {{is the use of}} <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> a protest movement in the Philippines that resulted in the resignation of President Joseph Estrada in 2001. I then look at the marketing and consumption of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> the (over) developed world, focusing on the USA. I argue that the Philippine protest movement, known as People Power II, indicates the medium’s progressive potential, while the marketing of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> the USA indicates the medium’s reactionary potential, or, borrowing a term from Paul Virilio, the <b>cell</b> <b>phone’s</b> potential as ‘technological nanny’. The comparison tries to steer between two orientations in cultural studies – which I characterize as the optimism of techno-utopianism and the pessimism of techno-phobia – in order to appreciate the political potential of <b>cell</b> <b>phones,</b> <b>in</b> particular, and technology in general...|$|R

5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} to get him off her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody. Keith rejects Harmony, and Logan nervously calls Keith for the whereabouts of Veronica. At the food court, Veronica is listening to voicemails from Logan and Keith when she notices an issue with her food. She returns to the counter with her plate, leaving her drink unattended. She returns to her seat but, after eating and drinking, soon feels disoriented. She recognizes this feelings as identical to her experience after ingesting GHB previously. Veronica attempts to get into her car and collapses just outside of it but she manages to set off the alarm. A mysterious figure appears and stops the alarm. There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's hair on the ground and a bald spot {{on the back of her}} head.|$|E

25|$|Steins;Gate 0 is {{a visual}} novel, where the player reads through {{the story in}} the form of {{passages}} of text and dialogue, accompanied by character sprites and background art. The story consists of multiple branches, which lead to different endings. As opposed to the original Steins;Gate single route that runs from start to finish with multiple branch points throughout, Steins;Gate 0 features one branch point near the beginning of the game, where the story splits into two major story branches, which in turn branch again into the different endings; there are in total two main story paths, along with four side stories. The direction of the story is determined based on whether or not the player chooses to answer calls from the artificial intelligence Amadeus, which the player character Rintaro Okabe can communicate with through his <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> <b>In</b> addition to Okabe, the player also takes the roles of other characters, mostly Suzuha Amane and Maho Hiyajo.|$|E
25|$|New spotter {{technologies}} and training techniques have been developing since the 1960s. Prior to the 1960s, {{the vast majority}} of amateur radio communication relied on AM-modulated signals and the use of simplex. It was not uncommon for spotters to hear the distant net control station and not hear other mobile or base stations which were much closer. After 1960, amateurs adopted the use of FM repeaters which operated in the VHF spectrum. The use of FM repeaters was a huge advancement for storm spotters; spotters could now hear each other regularly. The low noise floor and greatly improved audio quality meant much better signal reception for all stations. By the 1970s, nearly all spotter radio activity consisted of half-duplex FM repeater use. The next major technology to aid spotters was the development of the <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> <b>in</b> the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was then possible for non-amateur radio operators to directly report severe weather.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{evolving}} role of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> how people communicate {{every day is}} one of the fundamental challenges facing survey researchers as the popularity of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> the United States continues to grow. While the increase in cell-phone-only households (which doubled from 2. 8 % in 2003 to 5. 5 % in 2004, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study) is a major concern, a host of questions remains about how the use of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> even <b>in</b> households with landlines can affect telephone surveys. Using data from the South Carolina State Survey, this research (1) examines the level of effort required to reach landline-only households versus those with both a landline and a <b>cell</b> <b>phone,</b> (2) compares the demographic profiles of households with and without <b>cell</b> <b>phones,</b> and (3) assesses the likelihood that respondents will give up their landline <b>phone</b> for exclusive <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> use. The findings further our understanding of how <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> technology, even <b>in</b> households with landlines, is affecting survey research efforts...|$|R

500|$|Nancy Drew is {{a fictional}} American {{character}} in a mystery fiction series created by publisher Edward Stratemeyer as the female counterpart to his Hardy Boys series. The character first appeared in 1930. The books are ghostwritten {{by a number of}} authors and published under the collective pseudonym Carolyn Keene. [...] Over the decades, the character evolved in response to changes in US culture and tastes. The books were extensively revised and shortened, beginning in 1959, in part to lower printing costs with arguable success. In the revision process, the heroine's original character was changed to be less assertive and more feminine. In the 1980s, an older and more professional Nancy emerged in a new series, The Nancy Drew Files, that included romantic subplots for the sleuth. The original Nancy Drew Mystery Stories series started in 1930, and ended in 2004. Launched that same year, the Girl Detective series features Nancy driving a hybrid electric vehicle and using a <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> <b>In</b> 2013, the Girl Detective series ended, and a new current series called Nancy Drew Diaries was launched. Illustrations of the character evolved over time to reflect contemporary styles. The character proves continuously popular worldwide: at least 80million copies of the books have been sold, and the books have been translated into over 45 languages. Nancy Drew is featured in five films, two television shows, and a number of popular computer games; she also appears in a variety of merchandise sold around the world.|$|E

40|$|Offenders {{accepting}} contraband <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> secured facilities violate state corrections law, and {{the possession}} of these <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> {{is a form of}} risk taking behavior. When offenders continue this risky behavior, it affects their decision making in other domains where they are challenging authorities; and may impact the length of their incarceration. This qualitative phenomenological study examined the lived experience of ex-offenders who had contraband <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> secured correctional facilities in order to better understand their reasons for taking risks with contraband <b>cell</b> <b>phones.</b> The theoretical foundation for this study was Trimpop 2 ̆ 7 s risk-homeostasis and risk-motivation theories that suggest an individual 2 ̆ 7 s behaviors adapt to negotiate between perceived risk and desired risk in order to achieve satisfaction. The research question explored beliefs and perceptions of ex-offenders who chose to accept the risk of using contraband <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> during their time in secured facilities. Data were collected anonymously through recorded telephone interviews with 8 male adult ex-offenders and analyzed using thematic content analysis. Findings indicated participants felt empowered by possession of <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> <b>in</b> prison, and it was an acceptable risk to stay connected to family out of concern for loved ones. The study contributes to social change by providing those justice system administrators, and prison managers responsible for prison <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> policies with more detailed information about the motivations and perspectives of offenders in respect to using contraband <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> while imprisoned <b>in</b> secured facilities...|$|R
