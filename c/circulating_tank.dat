40|$|Experiments on a model ship {{have not}} so {{frequently}} {{performed in a}} <b>circulating</b> <b>tank,</b> because of an unreasonable belief that the results so obtained are dubious in the reliability. The experimental evidence presented in this and previous paper (1958 a,b) indicates that a <b>circulating</b> <b>tank</b> is not inferior to a towing tank when adequate corrections are applied. When the ship speed is as low as less than 12 knots, that is, {{in the case of}} the predominance of frictional resistance, the total resistance give a larger value than obtainable in a towing tank, working on a model of a large fishing vessel. This fact is due to an increase of frictional resistance in the turbulent flow. The modifications of the correction value for a towing tank test (ΔCf= 0. 0004 or ε= 1. 19), which should be applied for a <b>circulating</b> <b>tank,</b> are shown in Fig. 3. When the ship speed is over 12 knots, i. e. in case of the predominance of wave-making resistance, numerical value of the total resistance, and consequently D. H. P., approaches to that of the actual ship. Comparing these results with those of a small vessel presented in the previous paper, the influence of the electrically welded structure of the hull of the large vessel can be seen at low ship speed. ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{ordinary}} model exlperiments, {{especially in the}} case performed in the Towing Tank, the frictional resistance,－which owing to the existence of laminar flow, expresses smaller count than the actual one,－enforces the experimenters to fit a trip wire at the model vessel for the purpose of inducing a turbulent flow along the model in the boundary-layer. With the intention of improving these clumsy procedure we, forseeing the working effects of the <b>Circulating</b> <b>Tank</b> in connection with the character of the resistance in the turbulent flow, performed a comparative research on the experiment tests in the 2 different types of Tank under the use of the identical fishing vessel model, with the following results obtained. 1) When, as in case of the fishing vessel, the ship-speed is fixed within 10 knots, or within the slow speed at which the vessel resistance is frictional, both E. H. P. and D. H. P. got at the Circulating-experiment Tank showed more approximate value inherent in the actual ship than in case of the towing-experiment Tank; enabling the author to confirm the effect of the turbulent flow of the <b>Circulating</b> <b>Tank.</b> 2) In case of the ship-speed being over 10 knots, when most of the model resistance is wavemaking, no discrepancies were {{to be found in the}} two kinds of Tank; either case showed an approximate value inherent in the actual ship. 3) In the experiments done at the <b>Circulating</b> <b>Tank</b> (14 m. × 2 m. × 1 m.), no difrerence in the effects of scale ratio of the two similar model Lpp. 1. 50 m., 1. 00 m. was to be confirmed. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the fluid dynamical coefficients for plane netting, the following studies {{were carried out}} in the water <b>circulating</b> <b>tank</b> of Faculty of Fiseries, Kagoshima University and in the towing tank of Faculty of Fisheries, Hokkaido University. As a rule coefficients for fluid dynamical resistance of netting depend on the projective areas, and therefore it becomes necessary to {{determine the}} experimental equations for the areas towards verious attack angles. In these studies, the minimum unit of the netting fabric is termed as a "Netting element". At the elementary fabric a horizontal cutting is made at the respective intermediate points of the four knotted legs. The shape of a netting element is to be shown in the form "X". The netting used in these studies are "Weaver's knot netting" and the "twisted knotless netting" which are most familier in the Japanese fisheries. Basing on the two sets of tank-experiments made on the two kinds of the netting, the following results were obtained : 1) In the case of towing tank experiments the normal force coefficient and the tangential force coefficient are proved to be independent of the Reynolds number with in the range from 6 × 10 ^ 2 to 3 × 10 ^ 3; {{and in the case of}} the <b>circulating</b> <b>tank</b> experiments they are proved to be so with the range from 8 × 10 ^ 2 to 3 × 10 ^ 3. 2) The edge effect of the netting is not depending on mesh numbers when the value of 2 ij/(i+j) is larger than 6. 0.

40|$|Bubble sweep-down is a {{significant}} issue for the oceanographic vessels, which affect the acoustic sur- veys. Experimental trials, {{carried out in the}} Ifremerwave and current <b>circulating</b> <b>tank</b> on a 1 / 30 model of the Pourquoi pas?, are presented. The results demonstrate that this kind of experimental facility is well suited to study the phenomenon of bubble sweep-down encountered around the bow of a ship under specific conditions. From these results, two kinds of bubble clouds formation have been observed and analysed: bubble clouds generated by vortex shedding and breaking waves. The vortex shedding bubble clouds appear randomly in all the configurations tested, even without waves or motions. This phe- nomenon is due to the interaction between the turbulent flow and the specific bow shape of the Pourquoi pas?. On the other hand, the breaking wave clouds appear in the presence of relative motions between the free surface and the bow ship and more significantly under wave sollicitations.

40|$|A SWATH configuration, {{consisting}} of twin submerged axially symmetric hulls and slender vertical struts, produces a destabilizing pitch {{moment at the}} motion in calm water {{which leads to a}} dangerous vertical-plane instability above a certain critical speed. The aim of this research program was to search fur hull forms without control surfaces which maintain reasonable stability up to an economically interesting speed. Since the non-parallel forebody of the hull provides {{the main part of the}} resulting hydrodynamic pitch moment, the form variation was restricted solely to the forebody, where search started with the investigation of demihulls in a <b>circulating</b> <b>tank.</b> These test yielded hull forms with non-axially symmetric forebodies having upwards bended mean lines which did not show the tendency to become unstable in the vertical plane at velocities up to Fn= 1. 1. The extensive experiments yielded not only information about all the forces and moments acting on the SWATH-hulls, but also about the interaction effects between hulls and struts. With favourable hull forms the investigations had been continued with free-running twin-hull models in a towing tank. In addition to measurements of forces and moments at fixed models, the heave and pitch motions of free-moving models were investigated, too, with the main results that the destabilizing moment is less than the inherent pitch restoring moment which is proportional to the water-plane area of the struts. The thicker the struts the higher the save cruising speed. (orig.)

40|$|The ground ropes {{function}} {{is to keep the}} net in contact with the sea bottom, and herd fishes to the entrance of the bag net. In the case of thinking about selective fishing with a drag net, it is necessary to clarify the shape and herding function of the ground rope. But there are very few reports about it. In this paper, the author considered forces acting on the ground rope under towing conditions, and decided the shape of it analytically. The author designed a fish herding model the ground rope based on the theoretical probability of fiches entering the funnel of a net. Based on these results, the author investigated the shape and gear efficiency of the ground rope. Finally the author intended to obtain rational instructions for designing of ground rope. (1) The construction and weight distribution of three types of ground rope: Danish Seine, Bull Trawl and Trawl, (typical drag nets operated in Japan), were compared. Weight distribution of both Danich Seine and Trawl are uniform. But the mean weight of the later is much heavier than that of the former. It the case of comparison of Trawl and Bull Trawl, the former is long and increases its weight towards the middle. The latter is short and very heavy and shows little difference in its weight distribution. The difference in fishing methods are clearly influenced {{in the construction of the}} two types ground rope. (2) Three forces: hydraulic resistance of netting concentrated at the lacign line, hydraulic resistance of ground rope, and sliding frictional force between sea bottom are acting on the ground rope under towing conditions. At equilibrium those forces made a fixed ground rope shape. The author assumed the ground rope as a connection of segments, and considered an equlibrium among three components acting on them: horizontal, vertical and tangential components. In general it is impossible to express the vertical and horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope as a simple function. Assuming that the horizontal component acting on each segment of the ground rope is constant at any part, the length and end distances are known ahead of time, the shape of the ground rope was expressed graphically based on the distribution of vertical components of it which were obtained experimentaly. (3) The vertical component acting on each segment of the ground rope under towing conditions was expressed as the sum of hydraulic resistance, sliding frictional force and sand drag. Drag of clyinder type of bobbins at different lengths and that of sphere type of bobbins in various directions were measured both on wet concrete and in a sand tank with water. The drag of two types bobbin on a rocky bottom (F_D) had no directional qualities, and may be expressed as the product of weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μ_ 90); F_D=μ_ 90 W_B. The drag coefficient of cylinder type of bobbins and sphere type of bobbins were 0. 75 and 0. 68 respectively. The drag of cylinder type of bobbins in towed on a sandy bottom is dependent upon the on attack angle (90 °-θ), and may be expressed the product of the weight of bobbin (W_B) and drag coefficient (μθ) as follows; F_D=μθW_B. The drag coefficient is a function of θ　and is expressed as follows; μθ= 0. 68 (0. 72 sin^[1. 5]θ+cos^[1. 5]θ). In the case of a sphere, the drag coefficient was denoted a constant value of 0. 68. Hydraulic resistance of model ground rope composed of clyinder type of bobbins was measured in a <b>circulating</b> <b>tank.</b> Hydraulic drag coefficient (C_D) showed a constant value of about 0. 45. (4) Three types of model ground rope differing in weight distribution were made. These were examined both on wet concrete and sandy sea bottom under various conditions for the purpose of measuring shape and resistance. Close agreement was shown between experimental values of the shape and resistance of them, and those of calculated values obtained by analytically using the drag coeffieients mentioned above. When the distribution of forces acting on ground rope uder towing condition are known, the shape of it can be decided using the method proposed in this study. On the other hand the weight distribution of ground rope for making a certain ground rope shape can be decided using the method proposed in this study. (5) The author paid attention to fish reaction to the ground rope and considered a fish herding model for the ground rope. Theoretical probability of fishes entering the funnel of the bag net was calculated, and six theoretical types of ground rope: triangle, trapezoid, half ellipse, arc, parabola and catenary were compared. The fishing efficiency of trapezoid, parabola, half ellipse and catenary showed almost same values under towing condition based on the fish herding model for flat fish. The wing tips distance at maximum fishing efficiency was wider than usual towing conditions. Higher fishing efficiency would be expected under that towing condition. Fishing efficiency of two types of ground rope, middle-weighted Bull Trawl type and heavy-weighted Trawl type, were compared by towing on a sandy sea bottom using the fish herding model proposed in this study. Fishing efficiency of the former was a little higher than that of the latter. This corelates well with the results of field experiments. (6) The ratio of resistance of ground rope to the total resistance of drag net was about 30 - 35 % under towing condition. It is imposible to change a ground rope shape under towing condition by means of variation on the weight distribution of the ground rope. In the case of thinking on the ground rope shape, it is necessary to consider the hydraulic resistance of netting which were concentrated to the lacing lines and acting on the ground rope. The trapezoid shape glound rope was showed the fishing efficiency using the fish herding model proposed in this study. About 30 - 35 % of resistance of drag net should act on the points both edge of bosom of ground rope to make a trapezoid-shape ground rope. It is one method to concentrate whole drag acting on ground rope and hydraullic resistance of netting there as a results of many considerations on weight distribution of ground rope and the design of lacing lines...|$|E

The profiles of recurrence rate, determinism and averaged diagonal line length had similar tendency with the increasing Re, which showed that the determinism of PFS increased and the randomness of the chaotic system became small.

The different data {{as well as the}} results of the model were cross-checked with published data or results obtained through other experimental methods, i. e. hydrodynamic investigations on plastic-cast models in a <b>circulating</b> water <b>tank</b> or studies on live penguins using doubly-labelled water. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) of Adelie penguins on land concurred with data published in the literature. Although RMR of penguins in cold water was significantly lower than published values, calculation of penguin heat loss using these figures was matched by the results of Kooyman et al. (1976) who determined heat conductivity in penguin pelts. Similarly, cost of transport in penguins swimming under-water was significantly lower than published values for other penguin species. However my results were matched by those of a study on hydrodynamic properties of plastic-cast penguin models. Finally, calculations of the field metabolic rates of Adelie penguins using respirometry data and time-activity budgets doubly-labelled water study. (orig.)

However, in August 1943, rumours began to <b>circulate</b> that 10th <b>Tank</b> Brigade was scheduled for disbandment. Members of Parliament for the Lancashire towns complained about the possible loss of their TA battalions, and a recruiting team arrived to persuade men to volunteer for the Parchute Regiment if the brigade disbanded. Although 10th Tank Bde moved to Wensleydale in September, with 109 RAC based at Leyburn, and became a holding and training formation for reinforcements, the impending disbandment was confirmed shortly afterwards. During November and December, 109 RAC's officers and men were progressively posted overseas or to 51st Training Regiment RAC at nearby Catterick. Disbandment was completed {{by the end of}} the year and 1/6th Lancashire Fusiliers went into a state of 'suspended animation' on 1 January 1944. Unlike 1/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, which was reformed after the war, after the disbandment of 108 RAC, the 1/6th Battalion has never been reformed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the steady-state operation of phase-shift modulated dual-bridge series resonant converter (DBSRC) intended for dc/dc power bidirectional {{control over a}} wide range of input and output voltages. The analysis, developed here for the most general case of three independent phase-shift control angles, demonstrates the existence of minimum current trajectories in the 3 -D control space along which the DBSRC cell can deliver any admissible power level with minimum <b>tank</b> <b>circulating</b> current. At nonunity conversion ratios, minimum current operation prevents the DBSRC output bridge from experiencing severe hard-switching losses, substantially reducing the effort normally required by auxiliary zero-voltage switching assistance circuitry, and outperforming the efficiency of conventional one-angle modulation approaches especially at light load. The developed approach is validated via computer simulations and experimental tests on a 1 -kW DBSRC prototype. Tests performed at a nonunity voltage conversion ratio indicate a marked light-load efficiency improvement with respect to the conventional one-angle modulation, confirming the importance of the minimum current operation when the converter is expected to operate with programmable output voltages or under wide input voltage variations...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} ships {{equipped}} a shilling rudder has increased recently. It is easy comparatively to estimate {{a performance of}} a rudder that has a section as a normal wing section. But {{it is not easy}} to estimate a performance of a shilling rudder, theoretically with conventional methods, had inverse-wedge-shape. Therefore we have started from checking a situation of a surrounding flow of a rudder. And models of shilling rudder and of normal rudder with rectangle were made. Experiments were carried out in the <b>circulating</b> water <b>tank</b> of Kagoshima University. Experiment on visualization of 2 -dimensional flow fields in mid-span section of each rudder was done by depth tuft method. Furthermore the lift and the drag acting on the rudder and moment of the rudder shaft were measured. The influences that the rudder tail wedge angle of the shilling rudder effected these forces and moment were examined. As a result the following understood. When a rudder angle is 0, especially one of a shilling rudder, a flow of behind rudder was unstable in a flow immediately, after trailing edge. To calculate the forces acting on a shilling rudder theoretically, especially a situation of a flow around the tail part of a rudder needs to be grasped. We knew to be necessary to make visibility of the position where parted more from a relation. It is able to say that a shilling rudder is excellent in turning even from a normal rudder obviously. A value of drag of a shilling rudder is always larger than a normal redder. Wedge angle of the shilling rudder tail might make a turning performance conversely worse when the angle is greater than 20 °. As one of methods to calculate numerically the performance of a shilling rudder, we conceive that to add an influence of wedge angle α to one after determining the performance of a shilling rudder of wedge angle α= 0, first. ...|$|R
40|$|Studies on the {{efficiency}} of purse seines were carried out in a water <b>circulating</b> experimental <b>tank</b> in a static water condition using five simplified seine models of different hang-in ratios. The {{results indicate that the}} seine with hang-in ratio of 34 % sank the fastest and seines with 25 % and 30 % of hang-in ratios had sinking speeds nearly equal to each other. The final depth of the former seine wall was 91 % of the designed seine depth, while that for the later was 97 % and 100 %. From this data it is thought that a net with about a 30 % hang-in ratio is the most efficient for both fishing and also in terms of construction. Model experiments on the two net designs of mackerel purse seines operating in Indonesian waters revealed high sinking speed those are 53 % and 40 % of setting time, after that time both model nets decreased the sinking speed. So it is recommended to commence pursing because at this moment, the stretched seine wall of model net A showed 72 % and model net B showed 86 % of seine depth. The effects of various pursing speeds and pursing times on the purseline tension of two model nets A and B showed a quadratic function. The purseline tension of model net A was greater value than that of model net B, the reason might be caused by the different design and size of the seine used in the experiment. The relationship between pursing speed and the value of square root of the opening area of seine bottom by initial opening area of seine bottom was a linear function. The opening area of the seine bottom of model net B was faster closing than for model net A, even though the purseline length of model net B was longer than of model net A...|$|R
