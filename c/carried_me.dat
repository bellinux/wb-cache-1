Around 19:25 she was scuttled by two torpedoes from Hagikaze and sank stern-first at position [...] Ensign Takeshi Maeda, an injured Kaga B5N aircrew member rescued by Hagikaze, described the scene: [...] "My comrade <b>carried</b> <b>me</b> up to the deck so I could see the last moments of our beloved carrier, which was nearby. Even though I was in pain tears started to run down my cheeks, and everyone around me was crying; {{it was a very}} sad sight." ...|$|E
500|$|Much of {{the initial}} {{coverage}} of the event highlighted {{the difference between the}} reaction to Bush and Bridges (very positive) and that for Colbert (far more muted). [...] "The president killed. He's a tough act to follow—at all times," [...] said Colbert. On his show, Colbert joked that the unenthusiastic reception was actually [...] "very respectful silence" [...] and added that the crowd [...] "practically <b>carried</b> <b>me</b> out on their shoulders" [...] even though he was not ready to leave. On the May 1, 2006, episode of The Daily Show, on which Colbert had formerly been a correspondent, host Jon Stewart called Colbert's performance [...] "balls-alicious" [...] and stated, [...] "We've never been prouder of our Mr. Colbert, and, ah—holy shit!" ...|$|E
500|$|The low-lying fens {{surrounding}} {{the island of}} Ely were formed, prior to the 17th century, by alternate fresh-water and sea-water incursions. Major rivers in the region, including the Witham, Welland, Nene and Great Ouse, drain an area of some —five {{times larger than the}} fens—into the basin that forms the fens. Defoe in 1774 described the fens as [...] "the sink of no less than thirteen Counties". On 23November of that year, Church of England cleric and Christian theologician John Wesley, wrote of his approach to Ely after visiting Norwich: [...] "about eight, Wednesday, 23, Mr. Dancer met me with a chaise [...] and <b>carried</b> <b>me</b> to Ely. Oh, what want of common sense! Water covered the high road for a mile and a half. I asked, 'How must foot-people come to the town?' 'Why, they must wade through! Peat formed in the fresh-water swamps and meres whilst silts were deposited by the slow-moving sea-water. Francis Russell, Earl of Bedford, supported by Parliament, financed the draining of the fens during the 17th century, led by the Dutch engineer Cornelius Vermuyden; the fens continue to be drained to this day.|$|E

From three months old Misha B and her elder sister (Monique) {{were raised by}} their {{maternal}} aunt Lily. Misha B spoke of her upbringing, [...] "I will always look upon Lily as my mum, I've never had that relationship with my birth mum... we don't know each other.

2500|$|In summer 1827 {{the family}} visited Germany where in Weimar young Aleksey met Goethe. The great man greeted the boy very warmly {{and left him}} a {{fragment}} of a mammoth tusk with his own drawing (depicting a frigate) on it, for a present. Aleksey, having been awe-stricken, remembered little: [...] "Only his magnificent features {{and the way he}} took me upon his lap," [...] according to his autobiography. The family spent the next ten years in continuous travel, both in Russia and abroad. An 1831 trip to Italy especially impressed the 13-year-old. [...] "Back in Russia I fell into a deep nostalgic depression, longing for Italy which felt like a real motherland; desperately mourning the loss, I cried at night when my dreams <b>carried</b> <b>me</b> off to this Paradise lost," [...] he wrote in his autobiography decades later. In Italy the family met Karl Bryullov. On May 10, 1831, Aleksey wrote in his diary: [...] "Bryullov dined with us and left a sketch in my album." [...] The painter promised Perovsky to make portraits of all three of them once he was back in Russia, but five years later he had finished only one, that of his nephew.|$|E
2500|$|Dave Kehr, in the Chicago Reader, wrote, [...] "Richter {{seems to}} have invented an {{elaborate}} mythology for his hero ... but he never bothers to explicate it; the film gives you the mildly annoying sensation of being left out of a not very good private joke". In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote that Buckaroo Banzai [...] "may well {{turn out to be}} a pilot film for other theatrical features, though this one would be hard to top for pure, nutty fun". Richard Corliss, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "its creators, Earl Mac Rauch and W.D. Richter, propel their film with such pace and farfetched style that anyone without Ph.D.s in astrophysics and pop culture is likely to get lost in the ganglion of story strands. One wonders if the movie is too ambitious, facetious and hip for its own box-office good". Film critic Pauline Kael wrote, [...] "I didn't find it hard to accept the uninflected, deadpan tone, and to enjoy Buckaroo Banzai for its inventiveness and the gags that bounce off other adventure movies, other comedies. The picture's sense of fun <b>carried</b> <b>me</b> along".|$|E

2500|$|June Juanico [...] "recalls a {{time when}} she stood up to Elvis in front of his band of hangers-on, who even then were {{beginning}} to accompany him everywhere. He grabbed her arm, took her into the bathroom and declared: 'Look, you are so right, I am really sorry.' He kept her there for five minutes, then swaggered out, his image intact." [...] Julie Parrish, Presley's co-star in Paradise Hawaiian Style, relates, [...] "One time on set I had a real pain in my side – a side-effect, I think – and Elvis scooped me up, <b>carried</b> <b>me</b> into his trailer and shut the door. Outside the crew was waiting and wondering, but Elvis was oblivious to the innuendo. He placed his hand over my side and tried to do some healing on me." [...] Playboy star and actress June Wilkinson remembered that she [...] "met Elvis on the set of King Creole. He invited me to dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ... Then Elvis gave me a tour of his suite, sat me on the bed in his bedroom and sang to me for two hours. That was it. The next day ... we had dinner again. He was very sweet, and he was friendly. He had more than sex on his mind. He got me to the airport on time, and our paths never crossed again." ...|$|E
