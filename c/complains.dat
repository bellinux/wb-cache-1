40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between customer dissatisfaction/satisfaction and <b>complaining</b> responses among bank customers in Ghana banking industry. The study was a cross-sectional survey that used a self-administered structured questionnaire to collect primary data from 448 customers from ten selected banks in Ghana. The findings are that, though dissatisfaction causes customer <b>complaining,</b> dissatisfaction was more prevalent among non-complainers than complainers. Again, frequency of <b>complaining</b> {{is more likely to}} increase overall satisfaction if managed effectively. The most likely to be used <b>complaining</b> responses are <b>complaining</b> in person and refraining from using the bank’s services, while the least likely to be used <b>complaining</b> responses are <b>complaining</b> to the mass media and consumer associations. Moreover, public bank customers are more likely to <b>complain</b> by refraining from using the bank’s services and warning family and friends than private bank customers do. There was significant correlation between <b>complaining</b> responses and frequency of <b>complaining,</b> and between <b>complaining</b> responses and overall satisfaction. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. In spite of its limitations, the paper contributes to the body of knowledge in the area of consume...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the effects}} of {{personality}} traits on <b>complaining</b> behaviour emerged in the early 1980 s, there is limited research in the service industry. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine whether consumer personality traits influence intentions to <b>complain</b> and whether product price and product types moderate the relationship between personality traits and intentions to <b>complain</b> in the retail industry. The research model is tested by logistic regression analysis on two groups of consumers who report passive and active <b>complaining</b> intentions. The study reveals that conscientious consumers who are open to new experiences tend to have higher intentions to <b>complain.</b> Being extroverted does not have any influence on <b>complaining</b> behaviour. Whilst price levels (low/high) and product types (grocery, clothing and electronics) improve the predictive ability of the <b>complaining</b> behaviour, the interaction effects relating to the three personality traits are statistically insignificant. Theoretical and managerial implications of the study findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The study {{examines}} customer’s motivation for <b>complaining</b> and non-complaining behaviour towards mobile telecommunication services. The {{study was a}} cross-sectional survey involving customers from four mobile telephony operators. A self-administered structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data and it was analysed using SPSS (version 16. 0). The findings are that the highest rated motive for <b>complaining</b> is seeking corrective actions, followed by seeking explanation, seeking remedy or redress, seeking apology, expression of emotion or anger and the least motive is seeking compensation or damages. The study also found that, for the reasons for non-complaining, the highest ranked is where {{it is too late}} to <b>complain,</b> followed by the perception that nothing will be done about the problem if <b>complained</b> and the least non-complaining motive is fear to <b>complain.</b> Moreover, it was found that age and marital status significantly influence <b>complaining</b> behaviour. Uniquely, the study found rational approach to <b>complaining</b> behaviour in the research context and presents a categorization of factors inducing non-complaining motives. Implications and limitations are discussed. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in the area of consumer <b>complaining</b> behaviour in the context of telephony industry in developing economies...|$|R
