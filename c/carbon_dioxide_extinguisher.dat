Changes in emergency breathing equipment make Fine Water Mist operationally preferable. Supplied oxygen breathing systems allow for safe discharge of a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher, without concerns of the crew inhaling unsafe levels of carbon dioxide. But the Portable Breathing Apparatus offers no more than 15 minutes of capability, and continued use of hose based supplied oxygen systems increases the oxygen content in a fire situation. NASA has developed a filtering respirator cartridge for use in a fire environment. It is qualified to provide up to 90 minutes of capability, and because it is a filtering respirator it does not add oxygen to the environment. The fire response respirator cartridge does not filter carbon dioxide, so a crew member discharging a CO 2 fire extinguisher while wearing this filtering respirator would be at risk of inhaling unsafe levels of CO 2. Fine Water Mist extinguishes a fire without creating a large volume of air with reduced oxygen and elevated CO 2. Compared to the carbon dioxide based Portable Fire Extinguisher, the flight qualification of Fine Water Mist systems requires special care. Qualification of the CO 2 based Portable Fire Extinguisher began with the assumption that any fire on ISS would be extinguished if the air in the fire environment reached a critical concentration of CO 2. Qualification of a CO 2 based system requires the developers to make assertions and assumptions about vehicle geometry and the ability of the extinguisher to deliver CO 2 in different geometric configurations, but the developers did not need to make assertions or assumptions {{about the size of the}} fire, the temperature, or the heat generation rate. Fine Water Mist systems extinguish a fire predominantly by removing heat [...] so qualification standards must evaluate geometry, but also temperature, heat transfer, and heat generation rate. This paper outlines and describes the methods used to develop standards used to qualify Fine Water Mist systems for a human spaceflight environment...|$|E

2500|$|The <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CO2) <b>extinguisher</b> {{was invented}} (at {{least in the}} US) by the Walter Kidde Company in 1924 in {{response}} to Bell Telephone's request for an electrically non-conductive chemical for extinguishing the previously difficult-to-extinguish fires in telephone switchboards. It consisted of a tall metal cylinder containing [...] of CO2 with a wheel valve and a woven brass, cotton covered hose, with a composite funnel-like horn as a nozzle.

FWM extinguishes a fire without creating a large volume of air with reduced oxygen and elevated CO 2. The following paper will discuss the unique functional and performance requirements that have been levied on the FWM PFE. In addition, the NASA ISS specific fire standards will be described which were developed to establish acceptable extinguisher performance. The paper will also discuss the flight hardware design. The fin e water mist fire extinguisher has two major elements: (1) the nozzle and crew interface, and (2) the tank. The nozzle and crew interface have been under development for several years. They have gone through several design iterations, and have been part of more than 400 fire challenge and spray characterizations. The crew and vehicle interface aspects of the design will use the heritage of the CO 2 based Portable Fire Extinguisher, to minimize the disruption to the crew and integration impacts to the ISS. The microgravity use environment of the system poses a set of unique design requirements specifically for the tank. The nozzle requirements drive a tank pressure that is 2 - 5 times higher than any commercially available water mist systems. Microgravity requires deliberate separation of gas and water, facilitated by a bladder, a diaphragm, a piston, or separate tanks. This paper will describe status of the project to date, the design details of the tank and the nozzle, and discuss the trade studies that informed the decisions to select the tank and nozzle configuration...|$|E

The crew failed to vent the CO-2 from the plane as they were supposed to do in such a situation. The <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> then leaked into the main cabin of the plane and incapacitated the crew. The crew then became disoriented and declared an emergency descent, not realizing the problem. The aircraft hit power lines in its emergency descent and burst into flames, killing all 43 people on board.|$|R
50|$|Without {{sufficient}} oxygen, a fire cannot begin, and it cannot continue. With a decreased oxygen concentration, {{the combustion}} process slows. Oxygen can be denied to a fire using a <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> fire <b>extinguisher,</b> a fire blanket or water.|$|R
50|$|Combustion is the {{chemical}} reaction that feeds a fire more heat and {{allows it to}} continue. When the fire involves burning metals like lithium, magnesium, titanium, etc. (known as a class-D fire), it becomes even more important to consider the energy release. The metals react faster with water than with oxygen and thereby more energy is released. Putting water on such a fire results in the fire getting hotter or even exploding. <b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>extinguishers</b> are ineffective against certain metals such as titanium. Therefore, inert agents (e.g. dry sand) must be used to break the chain reaction of metallic combustion.|$|R
25|$|A {{state-of-the-art}} automatic <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> fire <b>extinguisher</b> {{designed to}} cope with such fires had been installed over the vat after a non-fatal fire in 1983 at the fire department's request.

50|$|An {{odorizer}} is {{a device}} that adds an odorant to a gas. The most common type is one that adds a mercaptan liquid into natural gas distribution systems so that leaks can be readily detected. Other types {{have been used for}} <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> fire <b>extinguishers.</b>|$|R

In the off-road scenes in the third film, a modified-for-off-road VW Beetle frame was fitted to the DeLorean with the whitewall tires and baby Moon hubcaps. A seventh DeLorean was also used in the filming; however, this one was merely a full-sized, fiberglass model used for exterior shots where the vehicle hovers above the set as well as when the actors interact with the vehicle.|$|R
25|$|A {{teaching}} laboratory demonstration for {{the production}} of dry ice is to use a 15 lb aluminum <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> fire <b>extinguisher</b> with a porous fabric collecting bag over the nozzle. The Joule-Thomson expansion of the gas lowers the temperature enough to produce an approximate 50/50 mixture of CO2 gas and dry ice snow also called dust that is collected in the bag. This is an inefficient process, and unsuitable for even lab-scale production. The expansion is inefficient, fire extinguishers are an expensive way to buy <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide,</b> especially when a signed and dated fire extinguisher certification is required.|$|R
50|$|<b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> {{can be used}} to {{extinguish}} flames by flooding the environment around the flame with the gas. It does not itself react {{to extinguish}} the flame, but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it. Some fire extinguishers, especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> under pressure. <b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> <b>extinguishers</b> work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, because although it excludes oxygen, it does not cool the burning substances significantly and when the <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> disperses they are free to catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Their desirability in electrical fire stems from the fact that, unlike water or other chemical based methods, <b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> will not cause short circuits, leading to even more damage to equipment. Because it is a gas, it is also easy to dispense large amounts of the gas automatically in IT infrastructure rooms, where the fire itself might be hard to reach with more immediate methods because it is behind rack doors and inside of cases. <b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space. International Maritime Organization standards also recognize <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. <b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations. A review of CO2 systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report, causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries.|$|R

5000|$|Fires are {{classified}} by the proper extinguishing agent. While water {{is used to}} fire Class A fires, using water on a class B fire (such as a grease fire) is extremely dangerous. This is because burning grease is hotter that the boiling point of water (212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius); when water is placed on grease, it creates steam which expands rapidly and splatters, causing burns and spreading the fire). Because of this, Class A fire extinguishers use water, while Class B fire extinguishers use dry chemicals (foam or powder), such as aqueous film-forming foam, multi-purpose dry chemicals such as ammonium phosphate, and halogenated agents (such as Halon 1301 and Halon 1211).
