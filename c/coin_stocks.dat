The change did {{not occur}} in the 5 seniti initially as {{there was still a}} reasonable quantity of <b>coins</b> in <b>stock</b> {{at the time of the}} change.

A new obverse design for George Tupou V had not yet been made or selected at this time, possibly due to increased health concerns regarding the latter monarch, who died in March 2012.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, before the 2007 global {{financial}} crisis {{there was a}} belief that, for advanced economies, destabilizing, systematic, multi-country financial crises were {{a relic of the}} past, as if they were free from that problem. Those economies were in fact experiencing a period of [...] "Great Moderation", a term <b>coined</b> by <b>Stock</b> and Watson (2002) [...] in reference to the reduction of the volatility of business cycle fluctuations, which could be seen in the data since the 1980s. However, the conclusion of some economists that those countries were immune from such crises was, at least, precipitated. The Nobel Prize literature in Economics Robert Lucas, Jr., for example, said that the [...] "central problem of depression-prevention (has) been solved, for all practical purposes". Thus, relying on this misconception, Advanced Economies engaged in excessive financial risk taking by allowing for great deregulations in their banking systems, which made them more susceptible to banking crises.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} part of a larger work whose aim is to examine the {{historical}} significance of the tens of thousands of Islamic silver coins or dirhams which appeared in Eastern Europe during the pre-Mongol era. The first part of this work explored the questions of when and how dirhams first reached European Russia. Very briefly, this initial study led to the following conclusions: 1. Dirhams first reached Eastern Europe about 800 A. D., as R. Fasmer (Vasmer) argued a half-century ago. 2. The earliest dirham hoards from Eastern Europe are almost identical in composition with contemporaneous Near Eastern hoards (both contain a predominance of 'Abbasid coins struck after 769 in Iraq and North Africa). This suggests that the earliest Eastern-European hoards were composed from the Near-Eastern <b>coin</b> <b>stock</b> of the time. 3. The earliest dirham hoards from Eastern Europe are completely different in composition from the contemporaneous hoards found in Transoxiana indicating that the earliest dirhams to reach Eastern Europe did not come via Central Asia. 4. An analysis of the early Caucasian dirham hoards revealed that the composition of some of these hoards differs from that of Eastern-European and Near-Eastern hoards in that the Caucasian hoards contain a higher percentage of dirhams from South-Caucasian mints and a lesser percentage of coins from North-African mints. This suggests that these hoards were composed of dirhams imported from the Near East which had circulated in the Southern Caucasus for some time before being deposited. 5. Other early dirham hoards from the Caucasus, however, are very similar in composition to contemporaneous Near-Eastern and Eastern-European dirham hoards. This suggests that these hoards were composed of coins which were apparently being transported to Eastern Europe from the Near East and were buried accidentally while in route through the Caucasus. In short, the first segment of this research concluded that dirhams began to reach Eastern Europe around the year 800 and that they were imported by the Caucasus or Caspian route from the Near East. The purpose of this study is to investigate the historical circumstances which would explain why dirhams were first brought by the Caucasus or Caspian route to Eastern Europe in the early ninth century. It is pertinent to note that, to the best of my knowledge"no one has yet addressed this fundamental question in any depth. Consequently, in discussing this issue, it is not our intention to claim that the thesis which will be put forward is irrefutable or that no other thesis could explain the available data. Rather, the objective is to raise the question of why dirhams first reached Eastern Europe around 800 A. D. by the Caucasus-Caspian route and to suggest a possible solution. This study should thus be considered as the presentation of a working hypothesis which will hopefully inspire others to examine a basic question of medieval Eurasian history which has been too long ignored...|$|R
5000|$|Once upon a time, five aeons ago, the Bodhisattva {{was born}} in a family of trading cast and was famous named Kacchaputa, a dealer in pots and pans, in his age. One time, He reached the city of Andhapura, where was {{situated}} beyond the river Neelavahini, accompanied by another greedy trader called Seri, for business. Both of them apportioned the streets of the city amongst them and were selling their goods. At that time a rich family of nobility had become very poor. All the younger brothers, the children and the wealth were lost survived by one granddaughter with her grandmother. They lived by serving others for wages. There was in their house among other pots, a golden bowl which the great merchant had used to have his meals and being unused it was cov- ered with soot. They did not know that it was a golden bowl. The greedy merchant at that time was going through this street advertising his wares the young girl saw this merchant and appealed to the grandmother to buy a trinket for her. The grandmother replied [...] "We are poor, what can we give him for the trinket?" [...] The young girl reminded her of the bowl and being unable to escape her plead- ing she brought the bowl and gave it to the trader and asked him for a trinket in exchange. The greedy trader took the bowl and suspecting it to be a golden bowl drew a line over it by a needle and knowing it for certain that it was gold, through that he would take it by giving nothing and said. [...] "What value there in this bowl? Not even half a farthing" [...] He then threw it on the floor and went away.Meanwhile, the Bodhisattva thought that it would be in order enter the street where one trader had already gone and left it and entered the same street shout- ing [...] "Trinkets for sale" [...] and came to the very door of that house. The young girl again made the same request to her grandmother who retorted that the earlier trader threw away the bowl and went away and there is nothing else to be offered to the next trader. The girl replied [...] "Grandmother, Dear, That trader was harsh: but this one is pleasant and soft spoken and we will give this bowl to him and get the trinkets."The trader was invited to and the bowl was given to him who at once knew it to be a golden bowl and said. [...] "Mother, this bowl is invaluable and I don't have goods for such value" [...] The grandmother replied that the earlier trader threw it away saying it was not worth even half a farthing and it has turned to be golden bowl because of your goodness and merit and we will give it to you and you can give us something for it and take it away. The Bodhisattva then gave hundred pieces of gold <b>coins</b> (Kahavanu) and <b>stock</b> of goods worth five hundred retaining his scales, the bag and eight pieces of money. The Great Bodhisattva then speeded up to the river ferry, paid eight pieces to the ferry-man and jumped to the boat. The greedy trader meanwhile went to that house again and requested for the bowl saying that he will pay something. The grandmother and the girl scolded him telling that he made the pure golden bowl worth not even half a farthing whereas a righteous trader perhaps his teacher bought it for thousand pieces and went away. Hearing this he was so grieved that he lost the bowl and due to intense sorrow, he lost his senses, flung away the coins he had and the goods at the door of that house, threw away his upper clothes, took the scales in his hand like a club and chased after the Bodhisattva. Arriving at the river-side he saw the Bodhisattva crossing the river and shouted [...] "You ferry-man, will you stop that boat" [...] The Bodhisattva advised the ferryman not to reverse the boat but proceed. The greedy trader seeing the Bodhisattva proceeding despite this request was seized by intense sorrow. His heart was burning and warm blood oozed out from the mouth and from heart break he perished. Contracting hatred against the Bodhisattva. This is the first enmity of the Devadatta Sthavira har- boured against the Bodhisattva. The Bodhisattva thereafter died after engaging in charity and such other activities. The Lord of the Three Worlds explained this lesson and declared even as in the past, the trader Serivanija did not obtain the pure golden bowl worth hundred thousand and did not make an attempt to possess it. You the Sangha will grieve by not endeavouring to achieve the correct path like the golden bowl. And if you do not abandon the perseverance, you will achieve the Lokottara Dhamma. He then expounded the Four Noble Truths after which the persevering members achieved the Fruit of Arhat.|$|R
