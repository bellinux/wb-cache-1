40|$|In {{this paper}} I suggest that {{analysis}} of specialised corpora of texts from particular scientific areas using <b>concordancing</b> <b>tools</b> may provide useful {{information for the}} ESP teacher, principally when selecting and grading items {{to be included in}} the syllabus or when desigining materials for an ESP course. The scientific area I consider here is medicine and, to exemplify possible uses of corpus concordancing, I consider a corpus of medical research papers about hepatitis of about 30, 000 words. The methodology used can equally be applied to any othe similar corpus of "special language" texts. In these pages I first explain whct <b>concordancing</b> <b>tools</b> are; i then focus on the type of information they provide and, finally, on how this information can be exploited in both syllabus and materials design.

30|$|Students {{being interviewed}} {{generally}} expressed {{positive attitudes toward}} the application of DDL in revising compositions but there were still some students claiming that DDL activities sometimes decrease their motivation. Teachers are suggested to design appropriate DDL tasks based on individual learners’ needs and analytical abilities; in addition, more training and guidance should be offered to help them overcome the technical and psychological barrier. In addition, to counter the potential barriers of using corpora in writing, the combined use {{of different types of}} reference resources in DDL activities should be considered. As stated by Yoon (2016), using <b>concordancing</b> <b>tools</b> along with other complementary reference resources within a single interface may help advanced L 2 writers more effectively in writing. Thus further study can be conducted to explore the effectiveness of the combined use of different reference resources in writing.|$|E

Use of these tools is recommended as a useful or even essential complement to a conventional dictionary-based approach, especially considering the increasing availability of large volumes of text in electronic format and reasonably'priced tools for text analysis. The first section of the article presents a profile of graduate-level translation students at Dublin City University (Ireland) and outlines the:'. evei of expertise they are expected to achieve. Normal translation practice and some common problems encountered by students in using conventional dictionaries are outlined. Subsequently, the types of electronic resources now available to those students are described, and ways they can be exploited successfully are explained.

40|$|A {{translation}} memory is an archive of existing translations, structured {{in such a}} way as to promote translation re-use. Under this broad definition, an interactive bilingual <b>concordancing</b> <b>tool</b> like the RALI’s TransSearch system certainly qualifies as a {{translation memory}}. This paper describes the Web-based version of TransSearch, which, for the last three years, has given Internet users access to a large English-French translation database made up of Canadian parliamentary debates. Despite the fact that the RALI has done very little to publicize the availability of TransSearch on the Web, the system has been attracting a growing and impressive number of users. We present some basic data on who is using TransSearch and how, data which was collected from the system’s log file and by means of a questionnaire recently added to our Web site. We conclude with a call to the international community to help set up a network of bi-textual databases like TransSearch, which translators around the world could freely access over the Web. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we look at}} {{evaluation}} as {{an activity}} carried out jointly by participants in interaction. The perspective we take is that of conversation analysis, {{that is to say}} we analyse the recurrent and systematic features of sequences of talk in which evaluation is negotiated and produced by participants. The method we use is data-based in that we analyse audio and video recordings of naturally occurring talk with the help of detailed transcriptions, but not corpus-based in that we do not use <b>concordancing</b> <b>tools.</b> The study provides an initial characterization of two types of evaluative conversational sequence and offers the possibility of an improved understanding of evaluative expressions and lexical items. In this sense we suggest that the type of analysis we present here may possibly be seen as complementary to the more established corpus-based approach to the analysis of lexical or phraseological items. A further point of interest in this paper is that the data analysed are conversations in which Italian students of English work through a learning task assigned to them in class. So the language we look at is not native English but learner English spoken by Italian university students. Hyland (2002 b) claims that evaluation is a feature of academic discourse that may affect students’ comprehension and that EFL teaching may underestimate its importance. By looking at how Italian EFL students produce evaluation in spoken interaction in English it may be possible, therefore, both to test this claim and to suggest ways for developing learning activities to improve student's awareness of the function and meaning of evaluation in discourse...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} PAX, ”Portable Audio Concordance System”, a proof-of-concept {{prototype of}} a multipurpose, multilingual audio concordance toolkit. The {{primary goal is}} to support efficient grammar and lexicon construction in the documentation of unwritten languages; languages currently included are Ega, Anyi, and Koulango (Ivory Coast), additional samples in German and English. The approach combines methods from corpus linguistics, annotation theory and practice, phonetics and lexicography. 1. Objectives Finding occurences of selected utterances in multimodal corpora for multimodal lexica is {{the objective of the}} Portable Audio Concordance System (PAX) 1. Modern dictionaries these days claim to be corpus based, for example lexica from the COBUILD project (see (Sinclair, 1987)). This is in the sense that 1. the order of different meanings corresponds to the frequency in a defined corpus 2. the examples for the use of different words are taken from real world data, i. e. corpora. This presupposes a sufficiently preprocessed (markedup) textual source. For written texts {{there are a number of}} corpora used for this purpose such as the British National Corpus (British National Corpus, 2001) for English or the copora available via (COSMAS, 2002) for German. However, these corpora contain written texts, and there are concordances for lexical analysis of written texts, which are well known (see for example (van Eynde and Gibbon, 2000)), but no adequate <b>concordancing</b> <b>tools</b> for spoken language exist. The concordancing task for spoken language is difficult: units are less well identified, access to both transcription text and speech signal is required, and standard aids like word statistics need to be supplemented by visualised transformations of the speech signal. We demonstrate an enhanced KeyWord in Context (KWIC) concordance, based on a search space as defined by the annotation graph (Bird and Liberman, 2001), representing the transcription, and a search, which includes a variety of complex criteria. The XML formalism is based on the TASX format as described by (Milde and Gut, 2001). The position of a concordance in a concordance base...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePhd abstracts {{constitute}} a specific case of specialized academic genre. In the particular {{case of the}} French scientific community, they are now nearly always translated into or directly written in English by non native speakers. Therefore, they offer an interesting opportunity to understand how would-be researchers try and build up their authorial stance through this specific type of writing. Besides defining their field of investigation and formulating new scientific propositions, authors have to demonstrate their ability {{to belong to a}} discourse community through their mastering of a specific genre. Based on the study of parallel corpora of abstracts written in English by NS and NNS in different disciplines, evidence is given of phraseological regularities specific to NS and NNS. The abstracts belong to different disciplines and fields of research, mainly in hard sciences, such as “material science”, “information research”,” mathematics didactics”. We analyse more specifically the expression of authorial stance through pronouns and impersonal tenses, modal verbs, adverbs and adjectives. The realization of lexical cohesion is considered as part of the building up of an authorial stance. Using the theoretical and methodological approach of lexicogrammar and genre study, the structure analysis of several texts in different disciplines and both languages (L 1 and L 2) provides evidence of different discourse planes specific to this type of text (Hunston 2000) : text and metatext, the abstract presenting an account of the thesis, which, in turn, accounts for and comments the research work. This detailed study makes it possible to distinguish the different markers used to separate the different planes. It also shows that all abstracts include the following elements or “moves” (Biber 2008) : referential discourse (theoretical basis), definition of a proposition or hypothesis, an account of the research work, conclusions and/or prescriptions. This will be mainly shown {{through the use of a}} combination of tenses and pronouns. Verbs and verbs collocations could also be semantically categorized and their distribution analysed, distribution analysis and semantic categorisation of verbs and their collocations providing further evidence on communicative strategies in abstracts. Based on these findings and using <b>concordancing</b> <b>tools,</b> a comparative study of abstracts written by NS and NNS t reveal significant differences between these two types of texts. This in turn leads to an interrogation as to the consequences on their specific semantic prosody and their acceptance by the academic community (Swales 1990). The results of this study, since they show evidence of phraseological regularities specific to an academic genre, could be useful for information research, giving leads towards the automatic recognition of the genre. Besides, the evidence of important differences between NS and NNS realisations and the analysis of their consequences will help to define more adapted goals to EAP teaching...|$|E
40|$|Tourism is {{a global}} {{cultural}} industry {{and one of the}} world’s largest international trades (Thurlow & Jaworski, 2011). As far as tourism is understood as an agent and channel of globalisation (Pritchard & Jaworski, 2005), it makes sense to investigate it from a critical perspective and analyse how its discourse shapes the tourist experience. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore ways in which hotel websites project a place identity for the hotel and, in doing so, for the town or city in which the hotel is located. I will ask how, and in what ways, this representation relies on socio-cultural conventions, which in turn may influence the discursive construction of the social actor “tourist”. Using Critical Discourse Analysis (see e. g. Fairclough, 1999, 2002) as a framework, I will also draw on Halliday’s (1985) transitivity system to identify the representational choices underlying the semantic encoding of the services the hotel offers made by the promoter of the hotel on its website. Using the <b>concordancing</b> <b>tool</b> AntConc 3. 4. 2 (Anthony, 2014), I will trace patterns of use, allowing for a further qualitative analysis of the data. The study is also of interest to the tourist industry inasmuch as it offers an insight into the social construction of a “tourist” identity, shaped according to prevailing symbols and codes in modern society...|$|R

Introduction [...] 2. Context of the research [...] 3. Literature review [...] 4. Methodology [...] 5. Thematic content {{analysis of the data}} [...] 6. SFL analysis of data [...] 7. Discussion [...] 8. Conclusions [...] AppendicesIn the world today, the demand for English teachers is growing exponentially in wide-ranging contexts and for numerous purposes. Despite this demand, teachers who do not speak English as their first language continue to experience bias in hiring and in the workplace even when they are well-qualified. In the United States, where the immigrant population has grown and continues to grow significantly, TESOL programs are also scurrying to meet the demand for ESL teachers. The teacher learners themselves form a diverse pool of native (NES) and nonnative English (NNES) speakers with various backgrounds in language learning. This qualitative study delved into the academic writing of the NES and NNES participants, who were enrolled in a Master's in Education/TESOL program in New York. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate their literacy development and language learning to add to the growing body of research in this area, specifically to discover more about the background and needs of NESs and NNESs in teacher preparation programs. [...] This study explored the nature of literacy and language development among NES and NNES teacher learners through an analysis of surveys and a two-pronged textual analysis, which involved a thematic content analysis and a Hallidayan Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) analysis of the literacy and linguistic autobiographies that the participants wrote as part of their coursework. Specific observer perspectives offered within the SFL framework, in particular the experiential and interpersonal metafunctions, were used as tools to discover how the participants construed and negotiated their experiences of language and literacy. SysConc, an SFL <b>concordancing</b> <b>tool,</b> aided in the selection of targeted clause complexes with the pronominal "I" and words related to literacy, including read, write, listen, speak, book, language, and learn. [...] The interpretation of the data indicated that literacy learning and language development are complex, interactive, and sometimes emotionally charged processes, about which the participants often expressed themselves through non-assertive lexicogrammatical choices. The comparison of data also revealed the people who most influenced the participants' language development, and the similarities and differences among their writings from the standpoint of grammatical intricacy. The research has implications for the development of literacy and the training of teachers of English. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 1 online resource (xvii, 413 pages) colour illustration...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a stylistic study of Mark Haddon’s "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time" (2003). The {{aim of the}} thesis was to explore the mind style of the narrator of the novel, Christopher Boone, who suffers from Asperger’s Syndrome. In other words, {{we wanted to see}} how Christopher’s {{idiosyncratic}} cognitive habits and word view can be reflected in his consistent linguistic choices. In order to do this, both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed. The theoretical fundament was Halliday’s Systemic Functional Grammar, but pragmatic theories on discourse coherence were utilized as well. It is argued that Christopher’s idiosyncratic mind style can be reflected in patterns of cohesion, coherence and transitivity and that the consistency of these patterns can be proved by way of a quantitative key word analysis by means of the Wordsmith <b>Tools</b> <b>concordancing</b> package...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCorpus use {{is one of}} the {{promising}} areas that can act as a reference tool to EFL learners for language problems especially vocabulary. The present study is on <b>concordancing</b> as a <b>tool</b> in learning collocations and it attempted to find the answers to two questions. One on the potential benefits of corpora and concordancing in learning collocations and the other on the type of the collocational combinations searched more by the students. To find the answer to the research questions, the students were taught how to use corpora independently in the hope of becoming autonomous users in future. The results of the study indicated an overall satisfaction {{with the use of the}} concordancers in learning collocations among which verb + noun collocations were searched more frequently as they were more problematic for EFL learners. In line with the results of the study some of the implications of using concordancing in learning and teaching are presented at the end of the paper...|$|R
40|$|Spoken texts {{provide a}} large {{quantity}} of information which extends beyond language; they include semiotic {{resources such as}} gesture, posture, gaze and facial expressions which, like language, contribute to the overall meaning-making of the texts (Kress and van Leeuwen 2006 : 41). However, until recently their investigation has completely relied on their 'basic' orthographic transcriptions (Leech 2000), {{partly due to the}} lack of adequate <b>concordancing</b> software <b>tools.</b> This has somewhat limited the potential spoken texts bring to language teaching and learning. Based on the theoretical and technical innovations which have taken place in the field of multimodal corpus linguistics (Baldry and Thibault 2001, 2006 b, forthcoming), especially within the MCA project (Baldry in press, Baldry and Thibault in press), this study presents a pedagogical application of spoken corpora in the promotion of communicative language competence by language learners at various levels of proficiency. In particular, it illustrates how MCA, a multimodal concordancer (Baldry 2005, Baldry and Beltrami 2005), can be used to create, annotate and concordance spoken corpora in terms of functions and notions (van Ek and Trim 1998, 2001). The study illustrates the kind of information the concordance lines and their associated film clips provide in terms of: a) the linguistic forms realizing a specific language function and b) the ways in which language interacts with its multimodal co-text (Baldry in press). In so doing, the paper introduces a new concordancing technique, namely multimodal functional-notional concordancing (Coccetta in press b), and presents two multimodal data-driven-learning (DDL) activities which show how this new approach to the analysis of spoken texts can enhance language learning...|$|R
40|$|Corpora of spoken {{texts are}} {{commonly}} investigated by applying approaches {{borrowed from the}} investigation of corpora of written texts, {{partly due to the}} lack of adequate <b>concordancing</b> software <b>tools.</b> This common practice has somewhat limited the potential spoken texts bring to the study of oral discourse. Based on the theoretical and technical innovations which have taken place in the field of multimodal corpus linguistics (Baldry and Thibault, 2001; 2006 a; 2006 b; forthcoming), especially within the MCA project (Baldry, 2007 b; 2008 a; Baldry and Thibault, 2008), this thesis presents an alternative method for analysing spoken corpora for language functions and notions (van Ek and Trim, 1998 a; 1998 b; 2001). In particular, it applies the scalar-level approach developed within multimodal corpus linguistics to a corpus of 52 texts, carefully selected from the Padova Multimedia English Corpus (Ackerley and Coccetta, 2007 a; 2007 b), and demon-strates how this approach to text analysis facilitates the study of language functions and notions vis-à-vis their multimodal co-text (Baldry, 2008 a). To illustrate this, the online multimodal concordancer MCA (Multimodal Corpus Authoring System) (Baldry, 2005; Baldry and Beltrami, 2005) was used to create, annotate and concordance the corpus in terms of functions and notions, as well as non-verbal features including gestures, dynamics and gaze. The findings of this research have been applied to English language teaching and learning by creating interactive activities illustrating the way in which corpora of spoken texts and multimodal concordancing techniques can be used by language learners and teaching material developers alike. The activities have been included in the online English course Le@rning Links (Ackerley, 2004; Ackerley and Cloke, 2005; Ackerley, Cloke and Mazurelle, 2006; Ackerley and Cloke, 2006; Ackerley and Coccetta, in press) ...|$|R
40|$|Lying at {{the heart}} of this volume is the web’s {{enticing}} appeal, but as yet essentially unrealized potential, as the ultimate corpus around which text-based studies of English can be shaped. Key words in this volume are thus web-based text analysis, structured web explorations, ready-made syllabus, focus on e-learning, step-by-step self study, teacher training, development of realistic web-based syllabuses, multimodal concordancing and annotation. As the subtitle indicates, the volume addresses the needs of teachers and students who want to frame text studies in English around the web but need a ready-made guide as to how this can be done. Rather than attempting to adapt traditional language-only <b>concordancing</b> and annotation <b>tools</b> and techniques to web-based studies of English, the volume presents software tools and text analysis techniques which sideline the traditional focus on lemma-based characteristics of corpora; it refocuses attention on an integrated and multimodal model of annotation, concordancing, and web analysis techniques – all of which is particularly useful when analysing web genres. The volume's starting point is an awareness of the need to adapt research on web analysis, concordancing and annotation into a self-access and/or classroom-learning syllabus, whence the volume’s incremental articulation as a series of steps which, as explained in the Introduction, correspond to 2 -hour lesson units that build up into a 30 -to- 40 hour ready-made course responding to the requirements of English language learning and teaching in a wide range of degree courses (e. g. Foreign Languages, Communication Studies, Law, Psychology and Political Sciences). The volume contains descriptions of web concordancing and annotation techniques, illustrations of their application and guided exercises as well as insets providing suggestions for teachers and students on how the resources presented in the book might best be used. The volume is also supported by a website with links to the software tools described, plus additional exercises and materials, many using the McaWeb web annotation and concordancing system (mcaweb. unipv. it) ...|$|R
