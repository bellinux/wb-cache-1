5000|$|Further {{aerodynamic}} refinements {{were carried}} out in Exeter {{with the development of}} new body shells which produced further reductions in the vehicle's drag. However, it was felt that something was lacking in the design and a 23-year-old industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, was brought in to refine the shell's appearance. He had won a Sinclair-sponsored electric vehicle design competition at the Royal College of Art and was hired on his graduation to set up an in-house car design studio at Sinclair's Metalab in Cambridge, of which he became the first employee. It was not only Desbarats' first project but, as he later said, [...] "day one of my working life", when he turned up at Sinclair's premises. He was taken aback when he saw the C5 for the first time, as he had been expecting a [...] "proper" [...] electric car. He said later that he thought [...] "the concept looked futuristic but was short on practicality. There were no instruments, nowhere to put anything and no security features." [...] Desbarats told Sinclair that the design would have to be redone from scratch, [...] "asking what we were doing about visibility, rear view mirrors, range indications ...". It was far too late for this, however; all the key design decisions had already been made. Desbarats told Sinclair that he would need four months to revisit the design and was given eight weeks instead. He created the styling that was used for the final production model of the C5, with wheel trims and a small luggage compartment being added subsequently. Desbarats was also responsible for the creation of the High-Vis Mast accessory, as he felt uncomfortable being so close to the ground with other drivers potentially not being able to see him. He later described his contribution as [...] "converting an ugly pointless device into a prettier, safer, and more usable pointless device".The chassis of the C5 consists of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a <b>closing</b> <b>plate</b> at the rear.

For the check valve extremely low backflow rates are tolerable at an operating temp. of the valve of 50 K. To fulfill these requirements, the sealing mechanism of the valve is based on a full metal to metal contact. In order to obtain sufficiently low leak rates, both parts were machined to a surface flatness in the order of 100 nm. In addn., the <b>closing</b> <b>plate</b> (boss) of the valve deforms (bends) slightly under pressure, forming itself to the opposite valve seat and thus reducing the gap between these parts.

40|$|We {{present a}} revised global plate motion model with {{continuously}} <b>closing</b> <b>plate</b> boundaries {{ranging from the}} Triassic at 230 Ma to the present day, assess differences among alternative absolute plate motion models, and review global tectonic events. Relatively high mean absolute plate motion rates of approximately 9 – 10 cm yr^(− 1) between 140 and 120 Ma {{may be related to}} transient plate motion accelerations driven by the successive emplacement of a sequence of large igneous provinces during that time. An event at ∼ 100 Ma is most clearly expressed in the Indian Ocean and may reflect the initiation of Andean-style subduction along southern continental Eurasia, whereas an acceleration at ∼ 80 Ma of mean rates from 6 to 8 cm yr^(− 1) reflects the initial northward acceleration of India and simultaneous speedups of plates in the Pacific. An event at ∼ 50 Ma expressed in relative, and some absolute, plate motion changes around the globe and in a reduction of global mean plate speeds from about 6 to 4 – 5 cm yr^(− 1) indicates that an increase in collisional forces (such as the India–Eurasia collision) and ridge subduction events in the Pacific (such as the Izanagi–Pacific Ridge) {{play a significant role in}} modulating plate velocities...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} for modeling a self-consistent set of global plate polygons. Each plate polygon {{is composed of}} a ﬁnite list of plate margins, all with different Euler poles. We introduce a "continuously closed plate" (CCP), such that, as each margin moves independently, the <b>plate</b> polygon remains <b>closed</b> geometrically {{as a function of}} time. This method solves emerging needs in computational geodynamics to combine kinematic with dynamic models. Because they have polygons that are too widely spaced in time and have inconsistent motions between margins and plates, traditional global plate tectonic reconstructions have become inadequate for geodynamics. The CCP algorithm has been incorporated into the GPlates open-source paleogeographic system. The algorithm is a set of procedures and data structures that operate on collections of reconstructed geometric data to form <b>closed</b> <b>plate</b> polygons; the main data structures used for each plate polygon are based on a nested hierarchy of topological elements. Reconstructions with CCPs can be created, edited, visualized, and exported with GPlates. The native storage of the dynamic reconstructions is the GPlates Markup Language, GPML, which uses an XML-based ﬁle format called GML. We demonstrate the utility of the CCP method by creating a global reconstruction with continuously <b>closing</b> <b>plates</b> from 140 Ma to the present using data from existing, traditional reconstructions. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mathematical {{modelling}} of {{the throttle}} body air flow {{is one of}} the first steps in generating a generic spark ignition (SI) engine model for control-oriented development. Typically, the throttle body flow model is subdivided into components: a one-dimensional isentropic flow law, an empirically derived effective area component and a <b>closed</b> <b>plate</b> leakage term. Of these, only the effective area term presents any difficulty. This paper describes the mathematical formulation and analysis of a generic model for the throttle body. Once the model is formulated, the experimental procedure for the identification and estimation of the numerical values of the elements within the model is described. The primary focus of the analysis procedure is the statistical modelling methods associated with calibrating the effective area term. Non-linear repeated measurement analysis methods are used for this purpose...|$|R

30|$|In conclusion, {{we found}} that the {{assessment}} of different biomarker levels and their changes over time is feasible in adolescent volleyball athletes with both open and <b>closed</b> growth <b>plates,</b> even though they still grow, and adult volleyball athletes. Specifically, adolescent volleyball athletes with both open and <b>closed</b> growth <b>plates</b> had higher levels of the type II collagen degradative biomarkers C 2 C-HUSA and CTX-II at BL than adult volleyball athletes. Further, {{we found that}} CPII, C 2 C-HUSA, and CTX-II decreased in BL open adolescents, and that C 2 C-HUSA and CILP- 2 increased in adult volleyball athletes over 2  years. These findings suggest that these biomarkers reflect differences in cartilage responses to high-impact joint loading in athletes of different ages and stages of development. The associations between patient-rated outcomes with CPII and COMP changes suggest that these biomarkers may reflect patients’ subjective clinical status. Future studies are required to assess how these biomarkers relate to the risk of future development of OA in athletes.|$|R

The genus Scoliocystis is intermediate between the families Cheirocrinidae and Echinoencrinitidae in having five periproct border plates (as in cheirocrinids), but lacking plate R 5 and having a reduced oral area, as in echinoencrinitids, but is retained in the Echinoencrinitidae. The similarity of Scoliocystis to the unusual North American cheirocrinid genus Sprinkleocystis is convergent. The genus Gonocrinites Eichwald, 1840, with two species, is restored among echinoencrinitids, as having four periproct border plates, whereas Echinoencrinites sensu stricto has three. The families Echinoencrinitidae and Callocystitidae arose from cheirocrinids with <b>closed</b> <b>plate</b> circlets {{by the loss of}} plate R 5 and substitution of radial:lateral for radial:radial pectinirhombs.

40|$|We used {{a rabbit}} model to {{investigate}} the mechanism by which the angulation of fractures is corrected in children. We produced a transverse proximal tibial fracture in one leg of 12 eight-week-old New Zealand white rabbits and measured bone alignment and length and the patterns of bone growth and remodelling. The angle between the joint surfaces changed rapidly to correct the alignment of the limb {{as a result of}} asymmetrical growth of epiphyseal plates. In an adult with <b>closed</b> <b>plates,</b> the angle between the joint surfaces cannot therefore improve. The angle at the fracture itself showed slow improvement because of bone drift and the asymmetrical growth of the epiphyseal plates. Remodelling corrected the shape of the bone in the region of the fracture. Periosteal division on the convex side increased the growth of the epiphyseal plate on that side, thus slowing the correction. The effect was relatively small, providing an indication that factors other than the periosteum are important in inducing correction. External torsional deformities developed because of helical growth at the plate. This was probably caused by abnormal posture which induced a torque at the growth plate. Helical growth is the mechanism by which rotational deformities can occur and correct...|$|R

40|$|We present {{azimuthal}} velocity profiles {{measured in}} a Taylor-Couette apparatus, {{which has been}} used as a model of stellar and planetary accretion disks. The apparatus has a cylinder radius ratio of η = 0. 716, an aspect-ratio of Γ = 11. 74, and the <b>plates</b> <b>closing</b> the cylinders in the axial direction are attached to the outer cylinder. We investigate angular momentum transport and Ekman pumping in the Rayleigh-stable regime. The regime is linearly stable and is characterized by radially increasing specific angular momentum. We present several Rayleigh-stable profiles for shear Reynolds numbers Re_S ∼ O(10 ^ 5), both for Ω_i > Ω_o > 0 (quasi-Keplerian regime) and Ω_o > Ω_i > 0 (sub-rotating regime) where Ω_i,o is the inner/outer cylinder rotation rate. None of the velocity profiles matches the non-vortical laminar Taylor-Couette profile. The deviation from that profile increased as solid-body rotation is approached at fixed Re_S. Flow super-rotation, an angular velocity greater than that of both cylinders, is observed in the sub-rotating regime. The velocity profiles give lower bounds for the torques required to rotate the inner cylinder that were larger than the torques for the case of laminar Taylor-Couette flow. The quasi-Keplerian profiles are composed of a well mixed inner region, having approximately constant angular momentum, connected to an outer region in solid-body rotation with the outer cylinder and attached axial boundaries. These regions suggest that the angular momentum is transported axially to the axial boundaries. Therefore, Taylor-Couette flow with <b>closing</b> <b>plates</b> attached to the outer cylinder is an imperfect model for accretion disk flows, especially with regard to their stability.

Cancellous bone histomorphometric analyses were performed on 20 -micron-thick undecalcified DTM sections.

Giving 1 mg PGE 2 /kg/d to OVX rats prevented most age-related changes and maintained the bone formation histomorphometry near basal levels. Treating OVX rats with 6 mg PGE 2 /kg/d prevented age-related bone changes, added extra bone, and improved microanatomical structure by stimulating bone formation without altering bone resorption.
