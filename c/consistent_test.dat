40|$|This paper explores {{conditions}} of existence {{of different types}} of <b>consistent</b> <b>tests.</b> New links of these types of consistency are also established. The existence of discernible (strong <b>consistent)</b> <b>tests</b> follows from the existence of pointwise <b>consistent</b> <b>tests.</b> If there are <b>consistent</b> <b>tests,</b> then the set of alternatives can be represented as countable union of nested subsets such that there are uniformly <b>consistent</b> <b>tests</b> for the hypothesis and each of this subset of alternatives. Implementing these results we explore both sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for existence of consistent, pointwise consistent, uniformly <b>consistent</b> and discernible <b>tests</b> for hypothesis testing on a probability measure of independent sample, on a mean measure of Poisson process, on a solution of linear ill-posed problems in Gaussian noise, on a solution of deconvolution problem and for the problem of signal detection in Gaussian white noise. In the last three cases the necessary conditions and sufficient conditions coincide. Comment: 24 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1308. 429...|$|R

This paper concludes that there are variations in FFUs' performance, and that using a <b>consistent</b> <b>testing</b> and evaluation method can generate compatible and comparable FFU performance information.

The energy goodness-of-fit statistic iswhere X and X' are independent and identically distributed {{according to the}} hypothesized distribution, and [...] The only required condition is that X has finite [...] moment under the null hypothesis. Under the null hypothesis , and the asymptotic distribution of Qn is a quadratic form of centered Gaussian random variables. Under an alternative hypothesis, Qn tends to infinity stochastically, and thus determines a statistically <b>consistent</b> <b>test.</b> For most applications the exponent 1 (Euclidean distance) can be applied. The important special case of testing multivariate normality is implemented in the energy package for R. Tests are also developed for heavy tailed distributions such as Pareto (power law), or stable distributions by application of exponents in (0,1).|$|E
50|$|To analyze a grain sample {{it first}} {{needs to be}} ground to a powder; a flour sample can be {{analyzed}} as is. The sample is put into the test tube; distilled water is added, and the tube is then shaken vigorously to achieve a homogeneous mix. The tube is then placed in the boiling water bath, and the operator begins to stir the sample. Simultaneously the starch begins to gelatinize and the slurry becomes more viscous. The mixing ensures the gelatinization is homogeneous in the slurry, crucial for <b>consistent</b> <b>test</b> results. An additional effect of the high temperature is that the alpha-amylase enzyme contained in the grain begins to break the starch down into glucose and maltose, thereby reducing the viscosity of the slurry. The amount of starch break-down is directly proportionate to the alpha-amylase activity, meaning that the higher {{the activity of the}} alpha-amylase, the lower the viscosity will be.|$|E

40|$|Designed to {{have power}} against all alternatives, omnibus <b>consistent</b> <b>tests</b> {{are the primary}} econometric tools for testing the correct {{specification}} of parametric conditional means {{when there is no}} information about the possible alternative. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to show that, contrary to what is generally believed, omnibus specification tests only have substantial local power against alternatives in a finite-dimensional space (usually unknown to the researcher). We call such a space the principal space. We characterize and estimate the principal space for CramÃ©râvon Mises tests. These results are some of the by-products of a detailed theoretical power analysis carried out in the paper. This investigation focuses on the class of the so-called integrated <b>consistent</b> <b>tests</b> under possibly heteroskedastic time series. A Monte Carlo experiment examines the finite-sample properties of tests and estimators of preferred alternatives. Finally, an application of our theory to test the martingale difference hypothesis of some exchange rates provides new information on the rejection of omnibus tests and illustrates our findings. ...|$|R

A solution may not exist if, for example, the instrument is not valid. This paper discusses the problem of testing the null hypothesis that a solution exists against the alternative {{that there is no}} solution. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of a solution and show that uniformly <b>consistent</b> <b>testing</b> of an unrestricted null hypothesis is not possible. Uniformly <b>consistent</b> <b>testing</b> is possible, however, if the nullhypothesis is restricted by assuming that any solution to the integral equation is smooth. Many functions of interest in applied econometrics, including demand functions and Engel curves, are expected to be smooth. The paper presents a statistic for testing the null hypothesis that a smooth solution exists. The <b>test</b> is <b>consistent</b> uniformly over a large class of probability distributions of the observable random variables for which the integral equation has no smooth solution.
