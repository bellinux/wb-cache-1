5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix their {{schedules}} to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour was longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so <b>civil</b> <b>time</b> no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|E

25|$|Through {{a series}} of misunderstandings or errors (the details of which are still controversial), the final {{approach}} to Howland Island using radio navigation was not successful. Fred Noonan had earlier written about problems affecting the accuracy of radio direction finding in navigation. Another cited cause of possible confusion was that the Itasca and Earhart planned their communication schedule using time systems set a half-hour apart, with Earhart using Greenwich <b>Civil</b> <b>Time</b> (GCT) and the Itasca under a Naval time zone designation system.|$|E

25|$|On July 5, 2005, the Head of the Earth Orientation Center of the IERS sent {{a notice}} to IERS Bulletins C and D subscribers, soliciting {{comments}} on a U.S. proposal before the ITU-R Study Group 7's WP7-A to eliminate leap seconds from the UTC broadcast standard before 2008 (the ITU-R {{is responsible for}} the definition of UTC). It was expected to be considered in November 2005, but the discussion has since been postponed. Under the proposal, leap seconds would be technically replaced by leap hours as an attempt to satisfy the legal requirements of several ITU-R member nations that <b>civil</b> <b>time</b> be astronomically tied to the Sun.|$|E
25|$|The UTC time standard, {{which is}} widely used for {{international}} timekeeping and as the reference for <b>civil</b> <b>time</b> in most countries, uses the international system (SI) definition of the second, based on atomic clocks. Like most time standards, UTC defines a grouping of seconds into minutes, hours, days, months, and years. However, the duration of one mean solar day is now slightly longer (by roughly 0.001 seconds) than 24 hours (86400 SI seconds) because {{the rotation of the}} Earth has slowed down. Therefore, if the UTC day were defined as precisely 86400 SI seconds, the UTC time-of-day would slowly drift apart from that of solar-based standards, such as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and its successor UT1. The purpose of a leap second is to compensate for this drift, by occasionally scheduling some UTC days with 86401 or (in principle) 86399 SI seconds.|$|E
25|$|Arguments {{against the}} {{proposal}} include the unknown expense {{of such a}} major change {{and the fact that}} universal time will no longer correspond to mean solar time. It is also answered that two timescales that do not follow leap seconds are already available, International Atomic Time (TAI) and Global Positioning System (GPS) time. Computers, for example, could use these and convert to UTC or local <b>civil</b> <b>time</b> as necessary for output. Inexpensive GPS timing receivers are readily available, and the satellite broadcasts include the necessary information to convert GPS time to UTC. It is also easy to convert GPS time to TAI, as TAI is always exactly 19 seconds ahead of GPS time. Examples of systems based on GPS time include the CDMA digital cellular systems IS-95 and CDMA2000. In general, computer systems use UTC and synchronize their clocks using Network Time Protocol (NTP). Systems that cannot tolerate disruptions caused by leap seconds can base their time on TAI and use Precision Time Protocol. However, the BIPM has pointed out that this proliferation of timescales leads to confusion.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{clock in}} the Jewish scheme, so that the local civil clock is used. Though the civil clock, {{including}} the one in use in Israel, incorporates local adoptions of various conventions such as time zones, standard times and daylight saving, these {{have no place in}} the Jewish scheme. The civil clock is used only as a reference point – in expressions such as: [...] "Shabbat starts at ...".

2500|$|There are two {{provisions}} in Morgan which has divided the circuit courts on the writ’s time limits to {{file an appeal}} from a district court’s decision on a coram nobis petition. First, Morgan held that “the writ of coram nobis {{is a step in}} the criminal case.” Second, Morgan held that “the writ of coram nobis is of the same general character as the writ of habeas corpus”. The Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth circuit courts have held that the <b>civil</b> <b>time</b> limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis [...] "of the same general character" [...] as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal. [...] However, the Eighth and Ninth circuit courts relied upon the statement in Morgan that a writ of coram nobis is a [...] "step in a criminal case" [...] and reasoned that it should therefore be governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals. [...] Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal.|$|E

50|$|In {{traditional}} astronomical usage, <b>civil</b> <b>time</b> {{was mean}} solar time reckoned from midnight. Before 1925, the astronomical time 00:00:00 meant noon, twelve hours after the <b>civil</b> <b>time</b> 00:00:00 which meant midnight. HM Nautical Almanac Office in the United Kingdom used Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) for both conventions, leading to ambiguity, whereas the Nautical Almanac Office at the United States Naval Observatory used GMT for the pre-1925 convention and Greenwich <b>Civil</b> <b>Time</b> (GCT) for the post-1924 convention until 1952. In 1928, the International Astronomical Union introduced the term Universal Time for GMT beginning at midnight, but the two Nautical Almanac Offices did not accept it until 1952.|$|E

50|$|<b>Civil</b> <b>time</b> is {{the local}} mean time for a {{meridian}} that often passes {{near the center of}} the time zone, and may possibly be further altered by daylight saving time.

50|$|When POSIX.1 was written, the {{question}} arose {{of how to}} precisely define time_t {{in the face of}} leap seconds.
