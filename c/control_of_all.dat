5|$|By 1967 {{many in the}} LSO {{felt that}} Fleischmann was seeking to exert too much {{influence}} on {{the affairs of the}} orchestra, and he resigned. Kertész, too, was dispensed with when he sought <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> artistic matters; his contract was not renewed when it expired in 1968. His successor as principal conductor was André Previn, who held the post for 11 years – at 2013 the longest tenure of the post to date.|$|E

Additionally, Hitler surrounded himself with staff officers with little or no recent combat experience.|$|E
5|$|In July 2017 the {{critical}} WiFi vulnerability BroadPwn affecting many iOS devices, including the iPad 2 was published. It allows an attacker to remotely take <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> affected devices within WiFi range without any user interaction. Since iOS 9 {{is in its}} end of life the iPad 2 won't receive a security patch for this vulnerability, making it dangerous to use them further.|$|E
5|$|Under {{a treaty}} of {{alliance}} with Attalus, Antiochus crossed the Taurus in 216BC, attacked Achaeus and besieged Sardis, and in 214BC, {{the second year of}} the siege, was able to take the city. However the citadel remained under Achaeus' control. Under the pretense of a rescue, Achaeus was finally captured and put to death, and the citadel surrendered. By 213BC, Antiochus had regained <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of his Asiatic provinces.|$|E

Wildlife was their last release on No Sleep Records before forming their own record label, Better Living.|$|E
5|$|Additional game modes are {{available}} to the player in The Age of Kings. One mode, random map, generates a map from one of several randomly chosen map generating scripts, with players starting in the Dark Age with a Town Center, three villagers (or more depending on civilization), and a scout unit. The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for {{a certain amount of}} time, or by obtaining <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> relics on the map for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing all of the other monarchs.|$|E

5|$|Andrew Cogan was {{succeeded by}} Francis Day (1643–1644), Thomas Ivie (1644–1648) and Thomas Greenhill (1648–52 and 1655–58). At {{the end of}} Greenhill's term in 1652, Fort St George was {{elevated}} to a Presidency, independent of Bantam and {{under the leadership of}} the first president, Aaron Baker (1652–1655). However, in 1655 the status of the fort was downgraded to an Agency and made subject to the factory at Surat, until 1684. In 1658, <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the factories in Bengal was given to Madras, when the English occupied the nearby village of Triplicane.|$|E
5|$|As at Northampton, Chapman's tactics {{were based}} upon the {{principles}} of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers, who would pass low inside the defence instead of crossing from the byline. He had been granted <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> footballing affairs at the club and made this responsibility work to his advantage, encouraging the club's reserve and third teams to play the same style of football so that their players would function effectively in the first team if selected. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network {{to find the right}} players for his tactical system. Bolstered by the money from the cup run, Chapman was able to make further signings such as goalkeeper Ted Taylor and forward Charlie Wilson (later to be joined by George Cook).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May, David Ben-Gurion was {{convinced}} that the Arab Legion expected to take <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community had very small reserves of fuel, bread, sugar and tea, which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months. In Glubb's opinion, the aim was still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and taking control of its Arab part. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention to impose a ceasefire for 4 weeks, which would prevent further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.|$|E

Nos.1 and 2(Training) Groups, and No.5 (Maintenance) Group, were disbanded between January and March 1946. Northern Command, {{having been}} re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, was disbanded in February 1947. The other area commands continued to function with essentially the same boundaries as during the war, except that North-Western Area no longer covered the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
5|$|In 1599, Michael won the Battle of Șelimbăr {{and soon}} entered Alba Iulia, {{becoming}} the imperial governor (i.e. de facto ruler) of Transylvania. A few months later, Michael's troops invaded Moldavia and reached its capital, Iaşi. The Moldavian leader Ieremia Movilă fled to Poland and Michael was declared Prince of Moldavia. Michael kept the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> three provinces {{for less than}} a year before the nobles of Transylvania and certain boyars in Moldavia and Wallachia rose against him in a series of revolts. Thereafter, Michael allied with the Imperial General Giorgio Basta and defeated an uprising of the Hungarian nobility at Gurăslău in Transylvania. Immediately after this victory, Rudolf ordered the assassination of Michael, an action carried out on 9 August 1601 by Basta's men.|$|E
5|$|In Saxony, a joint {{force of}} Austrians and Brunswickers {{under the command}} of General Kienmayer was far more successful, {{defeating}} a corps {{under the command of}} General Junot at the Battle of Gefrees. After taking the capital, Dresden, and pushing back an army under the command of Napoleon's brother, Jérôme Bonaparte, the Austrians were effectively in <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of Saxony. But by this time, the main Austrian force had already been defeated at Wagram and the armistice of Znaim had been agreed. The Duke of Brunswick however, refused to be bound by the armistice and led his corps on a fighting march right across Germany to the mouth of the River Weser, from where they sailed to England and entered British service.|$|E

5|$|On 17 February 1644, Jirgalang, who was {{a capable}} {{military}} leader but looked uninterested in managing state affairs, willingly yielded <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> official matters to Dorgon. After an alleged plot by Hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 May of that year, Hooge was stripped of his title of Imperial Prince and his co-conspirators were executed. Dorgon soon replaced Hooge's supporters (mostly from the Yellow Banners) with his own, thus gaining closer control of two more Banners. By early June 1644, he was in firm control of the Qing government and its military.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, 1941, Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union {{and within a}} week took <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> Lithuania. At first the Germans were greeted as liberators from the oppressive Soviet regime. The Lithuanians hoped that the Germans would re-establish their {{independence}} or at least allow some degree of autonomy (similar to the Slovak Republic). Organized by the Lithuanian Activist Front (LAF), Lithuanians rose in the anti-Soviet and pro-Nazi June Uprising, established the short-lived Provisional Government, and declared independence. However, the Germans did not recognize the Provisional Government and established their own civil administration, the Reichskommissariat Ostland. When the Red Army regained control of Lithuania in summer 1944–January 1945, the Lithuanian partisans began an armed struggle against the second Soviet occupation. An estimated 30,000 partisans and partisan supporters were killed during the guerrilla warfare between 1944 and 1953.|$|E
5|$|Quickly, the Austrians {{acquired}} <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the earthworks of the town, {{the village}} itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached {{one side of}} the abutment of an old bridge of palisades, and advanced to the other side, across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. There, almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels, they halted; there is some confusion about why they stopped. Possibly they mistook the abutment for the bridge itself, as Moreau seemed to think. Regardless, the troops there did not burn the bridge, but started plundering and drinking. The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge, but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them.|$|E
