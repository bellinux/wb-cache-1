5|$|The main role of NAD in {{metabolism}} is {{the transfer}} of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type are catalyzed by {{a large group of}} enzymes called oxidoreductases. The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates: for example NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by <b>coenzyme</b> <b>Q.</b> However, these enzymes are also referred to as dehydrogenases or reductases, with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase commonly being called NADH dehydrogenase or sometimes <b>coenzyme</b> <b>Q</b> reductase.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} catalyzed by complex III is the oxidation of one molecule of ubiquinol and {{the reduction}} of two molecules of cytochrome c, a heme protein loosely associated with the mitochondrion.

5|$|As <b>coenzyme</b> <b>Q</b> {{is reduced}} to ubiquinol {{on the inner side}} of the {{membrane}} and oxidized to ubiquinone on the other, a net transfer of protons across the membrane occurs, adding to the proton gradient. The rather complex two-step mechanism by which this occurs is important, as it increases the efficiency of proton transfer. If, instead of the Q cycle, one molecule of QH2 were used to directly reduce two molecules of cytochrome c, the efficiency would be halved, with only one proton transferred per cytochrome c reduced.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{properties}} of <b>coenzymes</b> <b>Q</b> (CoQ 9 and CoQ 10) are {{closely linked to}} their redox state (CoQox/total CoQ) × 100. In this work, CoQ redox state was biologically validated by high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical measurement after modulation of mitochondrial electron flow of cultured cells by molecules increasing (rotenone, carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone) or decreasing (antimycin) CoQ oxidation. The tissue specificity of CoQ redox state and content were investigated in control and hypoxic rats. In control rats, {{there was a strong}} negative linear regression between tissular CoQ redox state and CoQ content. Hypoxia increased CoQ 9 redox state and decreased CoQ 9 content in a negative linear relationship in the different tissues, except the heart and lung. This result demonstrates that, under conditions of mitochondrial impairment, CoQ redox control is tissue-specific...|$|R
40|$|Meat {{contains}} {{basic and}} essential nutrients to humans, and recently {{has been given}} a special attention to the presence of bioactive compounds. The objective of this work was the simultaneous determination of <b>coenzymes</b> <b>Q</b> 9 and Q 10 in pork meat, using HPLC. For this study were used 122 samples from different muscles and different breeds of pork meat. Besides, it was also evaluated the influence of animal breed and muscle type in the contents of CoQ 9 and CoQ 10. The results showed that the breed influenced significantly the mean content of CoQ 9 (0. 70 mg 100 g- 1) and CoQ 10 (3. 76 mg 100 g- 1) (P< 0. 0001), being this significantly higher in the meat from the breed Alentejano when compared to the other breeds (Large White and Landrace). The type of muscle was also responsible for the variation in the levels of coenzymes in the samples analysed (P< 0. 05) and (P< 0. 0001) respectively. From the results obtained it was concluded that the breed Alentejano presented the highest contents in both coenzymes (CoQ 9 and CoQ 10) and that, among the muscles evaluated, the muscle Semimembranousus (Sm) showed higher concentrations of CoQ 10...|$|R
40|$|Nigella sativa {{has been}} used for centuries as a natural remedy for a number of chronic and age-related diseases. Thymoquinone (TQ), the main {{constituent}} of its extracts, has recently received particular attention and has been tested for its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. To further investigate the mechanisms involved in the biological activities of this natural quinone and, among these, in its antioxidant properties, the redox-system of TQ and its interaction with superoxide was studied in aprotic medium by cyclic voltammetry, spectroelectrochemistry and Electron Spin Resonance (ESR). The electrochemical behavior of dithymoquinone (DTQ), the photodimer of TQ, was also studied in the same medium. Experimental data evidenced the formation of the radical anion TQ - by cathodic reduction of TQ at potential values very close to <b>coenzymes</b> <b>Q</b> ones, by electron transfer (ET) between TQ and superoxide, as KO 2 or electrogenerated, by chemical comproportionation between TQ and the dianion TQ - and by fast cleavage of the electrogenerated radical anion DTQ -. Spectroelectrochemical data evidenced that TQ -, in the presence of TQ, evolves to the hydroquinone monoanion TQH -, suggesting that an H-atom transfer (HT) may occur, likely from the isopropylic side-chain of TQ to TQ - The H-atom donating ability of TQ may be also supported by Bond Dissociation Energy values and ESR data. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (<b>coenzyme</b> <b>Q)</b> is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway. Another example is glutathione, which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.|$|E
5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second entry point to the {{electron}} transport chain. It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to <b>coenzyme</b> <b>Q,</b> but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E

40|$|<b>Coenzymes</b> <b>Q</b> (CoQ) are omnipresent {{molecules}} in livi ng systems, which {{in addition to}} being members of mitochondrial respiratory chain, possess several other functions of great importance for the cellular metabolism. They are among the most ap pealing redox active quinone derivatives. In mammals, the predominant homologue is CoQ 10 (ubiquinone). Unlike CoQ 10 which is lipophilic, its analogue CoQ 1 is much more hydrophilic, because contains only one instead of 10 isoprenoid groups i n the tail. The main purpose of using CoQ 1 was to {{serve as a model for}} exploring redox properties of CoQ group in aqueous medium. In an alkaline medium, CoQ 1 s can be hydroxylated at the quinoid ring. The chemical transformations of CoQ 1 in an alkaline medium has been studied by means of cyclic and square-wave voltammetry and it is showed that upon substitution of methoxy groups, hydroxylated derivatives of CoQ 1 are formed. The new hydroxilated derivatives exhibit distinct redox properties compared to the parent compound, as well as a profound complexing a ctivity of transition metal cations such as Fe 3 + and Co 2 +. Besides application of electrochemical techniques, to confirm further the chemical reaction and the structural changes of CoQ 1 in a strong alkaline medium and to investigate the complexing activity of metal cations, a set of spectroscopic experiments has been performe...|$|R
5|$|Within {{the inner}} {{mitochondrial}} membrane, the lipid-soluble electron carrier <b>coenzyme</b> Q10 (<b>Q)</b> carries both electrons and protons by a redox cycle. This small benzoquinone molecule is very hydrophobic, so it diffuses freely within the membrane. When Q accepts two electrons and two protons, it becomes {{reduced to the}} ubiquinol form (QH2); when QH2 releases two electrons and two protons, it becomes oxidized back to the ubiquinone (Q) form. As a result, if two enzymes are arranged so that Q is reduced {{on one side of}} the membrane and QH2 oxidized on the other, ubiquinone will couple these reactions and shuttle protons across the membrane. Some bacterial electron transport chains use different quinones, such as menaquinone, in addition to ubiquinone.|$|R
40|$|Though {{recently}} the mitochondrial bioenergetic <b>coenzyme</b> (Co) <b>Q</b> 10 {{has been shown}} to protect against indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration, yet the full mechanistic cassettes have not been investigated. Therefore, the current investigation assessed further gastroprotective mechanisms of CoQ 10 using the indomethacin-induced gastropathy model. While CoQ 10 was administered at 3 dose levels to male Wistar rats, the proton pump inhibitor, pantoprazole, was given at 4 dose levels ahead of pyloric ligation and indomethacin administration. Indomethacin evoked gastric ulcerations that were associated by decreased gastric mucosal nitric oxide and glutathione levels. The NSAID reduced gastric volume and mucin content, but increased titratable acidity, acid output, and peptic activity. CoQ 10, especially at the higher dose levels, as well as pantoprazole pretreatments reverted almost all diversions induced by the NSAID to different extends. Moreover, preadministration with the nonselective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME, boosted ulcer formation that was associated by suppression of gastric mucosal nitric oxide in CoQ 10 and pantoprazole-treated groups. The current investigation shows that CoQ 10 guards against gastric ulceration via its partial inhibition of titratable acidity and peptic activity, as well as enhancement of mucin secretion due to both gastric mucosal nitric oxide and glutathione replenishment, especially at the higher dose levels...|$|R

25|$|Energy {{obtained}} through {{the transfer of}} electrons down the ETC is used to pump protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical proton gradient (ΔpH) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). This proton gradient is largely but not exclusively responsible for the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨM). It allows ATP synthase to use the flow of H+ through the enzyme back into the matrix to generate ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate. Complex I (NADH <b>coenzyme</b> <b>Q</b> reductase; labeled I) accepts electrons from the Krebs cycle electron carrier nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and passes them to <b>coenzyme</b> <b>Q</b> (ubiquinone; labeled Q), which also receives electrons from complex II (succinate dehydrogenase; labeled II). Q passes electrons to complex III (cytochrome bc1 complex; labeled III), which passes them to cytochrome c (cyt c).

40|$|Escherichia coli and Salmonella {{contain the}} naphthoquinones {{menaquinone}} (MK; vitamin K 2) and demethylmenaquinone and the benzoquinone ubiquinone (<b>coenzyme</b> Q; <b>Q).</b> Both quinones {{are derived from}} the shikimate pathway, which {{has been called a}} "metabolic tree with many branches. " There are two different pathways for the biosynthesis of the naphthoquinones. The vast majority of prokaryotes, including E. coli and Salmonella, and the plants use the o-succinylbenzoate pathway, while a minority uses the futalosine pathway. The quinone nucleus of Q is derived directly from chorismate, while that of MK is derived from chorismate via isochorismate. The prenyl side chains of both quinones are from isopentenyl diphosphate formed by the 2 -C-methyl-D-erythritol 4 -phosphate (non-mevalonate) pathway and the methyl groups are from S-adenosylmethionine. In addition, MK biosynthesis requires 2 -ketoglutarate and cofactors ATP, coenzyme A, and thiamine pyrophosphate. Despite the fact that both quinones originate from the shikimate pathway, there are important differences in their biosyntheses. The prenyl side chain in MK biosynthesis is introduced at the penultimate step, accompanied by decarboxylation, whereas in Q biosynthesis it is introduced at the second step, with retention of the carboxyl group. In MK biosynthesis, all the reactions of the pathway up to prenylation are carried out by soluble enzymes, whereas all the enzymes involved in Q biosynthesis except the first are membrane bound. In MK biosynthesis, the last step is a C-methylation; in Q biosynthesis, the last step is an O-methylation. In Q biosynthesis a second C-methylation and O-methylation take place in the middle part of the pathway. Despite the fact that Q and MK biosyntheses diverge at chorismate, the C-methylations in both pathways are carried out by the same methyltransferase...|$|R
40|$|For {{nicotinamide}} 1,N 6 -ethenoadenine dinucleotide (epsilonNAD+), {{the fluorescent}} analog of NAD+, in neutral aqueous solution the quantum yield {{has been determined}} to be 0. 028 and the fluorescent lifetime, 2. 1 nsec. Simultaneous determination of quantum yields and lifetimes of epsilonNAD+ and of the "half molecule" epsilonAMP allows the calculation {{of the percentage of}} stacked and open conformations of the dinucleotide. At 25 degrees in neutral aqueous solution there is 45 +/- 5 % of stacked forms. The value of the fluorescent impurities, especially those containing the epsilon-adenosine moiety, and a purification procedure using high performance liquid chromatography was devised to obtain fluorescently homogeneous preparations. In order to study the effect on epsilon-adenosine fluorescence caused by the possible close proximity of a tryptophan in a polypeptide chain or protein, we have prepared 1,N 6 -etheno- 9 -[3 -(indol- 3 -yl) propyl]adenine (epsilonAde 9 -C 3 -Ind 3), a model compound in which indole is used as a neutral substitute for tryptophan. Fluorescence studies on epsilonAde 9 -C 3 -Ind 3 show that the formation of an intramolecular complex results in complete quenching of the epsilon-adenine fluorescence. It is therefore predictable that positioning of the epsilon-adenosine of any fluorescent <b>coenzyme</b> moiety (e. <b>q.,</b> epsilonATP, epsilonADP) in close proximity to a tryptophan in a protein will result in complete fluorescence quenching of the former...|$|R

As the production of reactive oxygen species by these proton-pumping complexes is greatest at high membrane potentials, it has been proposed that mitochondria regulate their activity to maintain the membrane potential within a narrow range that balances ATP production against oxidant generation. For instance, oxidants can activate uncoupling proteins that reduce membrane potential.|$|E
500|$|The use {{of oxygen}} {{as part of}} the process for {{generating}} metabolic energy produces reactive oxygen species. In this process, the superoxide anion is produced as a by-product of several steps in the electron transport chain. Particularly important is the reduction of <b>coenzyme</b> <b>Q</b> in complex III, since a highly reactive free radical is formed as an intermediate (Q·−). This unstable intermediate can lead to electron [...] "leakage", when electrons jump directly to oxygen and form the superoxide anion, instead of moving through the normal series of well-controlled reactions of the electron transport chain. Peroxide is also produced from the oxidation of reduced flavoproteins, such as complex I. However, although these enzymes can produce oxidants, the relative importance of the electron transfer chain to other processes that generate peroxide is unclear. In plants, algae, [...] and cyanobacteria, reactive oxygen species are also produced during photosynthesis, particularly under conditions of high light intensity. This effect is partly offset by the involvement of carotenoids in photoinhibition, and in algae and cyanobacteria, by large amount of iodide and selenium, which involves these antioxidants reacting with over-reduced forms of the photosynthetic reaction centres to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species.|$|E

2500|$|Firstly, the [...] NADH + H+ {{generated}} by glycolysis {{has to be}} transferred to the mitochondrion to be oxidized, and thus to regenerate the NAD+ necessary for glycolysis to continue. However the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. [...] Use is therefore made of two “shuttles” to transport the electrons from NADH across the mitochondrial membrane. They are the malate-aspartate shuttle and the glycerol phosphate shuttle. In the former the electrons from NADH are transferred to cytosolic oxaloacetate to form malate. The malate then traverses the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is reoxidized by NAD+ forming intra-mitochondrial oxaloacetate and NADH. The oxaloacetate is then re-cycled to the cytosol via its conversion to aspartate which is readily transported out of the mitochondrion. In the glycerol phosphate shuttle electrons from cytosolic NADH are transferred to dihydroxyacetone to form glycerol-3-phosphate which readily traverses the outer mitochondrial membrane. Glycerol-3-phosphate is then reoxidized to dihydroxyacetone, donating its electrons to FAD instead of NAD+. This reaction takes place on the inner mitochondrial membrane, allowing FADH2 to donate its electrons directly to <b>coenzyme</b> <b>Q</b> (ubiquinone) {{which is part of the}} electron transport chain which ultimately transfers electrons to molecular oxygen (O2), with the formation of water, and the release of energy eventually captured in the form of ATP.|$|E
