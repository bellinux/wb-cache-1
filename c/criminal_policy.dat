40|$|To be effective, <b>criminal</b> justice <b>policies</b> should {{affect the}} {{underlying}} social norms {{for which the}} policies were enacted. This study sought to determine whether public perceptions of <b>criminal</b> justice <b>policies</b> on domestic violence affected social norms. Two waves of data were collected via a telephone survey where a random probability sample of 973 residents was drawn from 4 communities. A structural equation model was tested and confirmed. Results provided {{strong support for the}} hypothesis that perceptions of <b>criminal</b> justice <b>policies</b> have direct effects on attitudes toward criminal justice response, and indirect effects on victim-blaming attitudes, both underlying social norms related to domestic violence. The enactment of <b>criminal</b> justice <b>policies,</b> therefore, may have an impact beyond victims and perpetrators and lead to a trans-formation of the community through the emergence of new social norms. Public awareness campaigns designed to disseminate <b>criminal</b> justice <b>policies</b> may be instrumental in provoking social change.

To answer this question, {{this article presents}} the first review specifically of studies that have examined the diffusion of <b>criminal</b> justice <b>policies</b> throughout U. S. states.
