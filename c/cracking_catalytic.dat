The catalytic cracking of LDPE produced liquid in the gasoline range, gases ranged from C 1 to C 4, and hydrogen gas. The increase in catalyst acidity improved gas yield {{at the expense}} of the liquid yield.

30|$|Gasoline in {{refineries}} comes {{mainly from}} the units such as steaming of crude oil, catalytic <b>cracking,</b> <b>catalytic</b> reforming, hydrocracking and alkylation. The fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process {{is one of the}} most important means in deep process of crude oil due to its applicability, flexibility and good economical feasibility. In China, more than 75  % of motor gasoline is provided by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units. However, the octane numbers of FCC gasoline is too low to meet the requirements of motor fuels. On the other hand, the increasing severe crude oil supplies worldwide and more attention on environmental regulations are promoting the tendency of converting heavy oil into high qualified gasoline with high octane numbers by FCC process [1, 2]. Besides, with the rapid development of China’s automobile industry, car ownership especially imported high-end cars and domestic joint ventures has been increasing substantially. To work with high compression as well as to meet the requirements of increasingly stringent environmental regulations on automobile engines, gasoline upgrading and the demand of high-octane gasoline are increasing prominently and had been rapidly increasing in recent decades.|$|E

They are involved in most processes of heterogeneous catalysis that has greatly revolutionized the refining processes during the half past century. It {{has contributed to the}} rapid development of processes such as: catalytic <b>cracking,</b> <b>catalytic</b> reforming and isomerization. As we know, the heterogeneous catalysis or contact catalysis aims to carry out a transformation of gaseous or liquid reactants by using a solid catalyst. The chemical processing occurs at the interface solid-fluid due to the absorption of reactants in the solid surface; this adsorption involves specific sites that are capable of contracting with the reactants of chemical bonds more or less strong. The adsorbed and formed sorts lead to the desired reaction if the catalyst is well selected, which is Sabatier principle. Thus, the establishment of superficial atoms and ions plays an important role. As a whole, the industrial solid catalyst are the heart of refining process and determine their future as well. More and more, the catalytic processes develop at the expense of thermal processes, and the discovery of new catalysts determines the development of new processes...|$|E
40|$|Catalytic {{oxidative}} cracking of naphtha is conceptually {{an alternative}} process to steam cracking. The performance of sol–gel synthesized Li/MgO in oxidative cracking of hexane {{as a model}} compound of naphtha, has been studied and {{compared to that of}} conventionally prepared catalyst. At a temperature as low as 575 °C, Li/MgO shows reasonable hexane conversions (28 mol%) and excellent selectivity to light olefins (60 mol%). It is proposed that hexane activation occurs on the catalyst surface via the Li+O− defect sites, where O− active sites abstract hydrogen from a secondary carbon atom. The formed hexyl radical in gas phase and in the presence of molecular oxygen will then undergo a complex radical chemistry resulting in a product mixture of C 1 –C 5 hydrocarbons (paraffins and olefins) as well as combustion products. Presence of oxygen in the feed is crucial to prevent coking, and to regenerate the catalyst surface through reaction with adsorbed surface hydrogen atoms, thus maintaining catalyst activity. Oxygen also plays a significant role in accelerating radical chemistry in gas phase. Unlike steam <b>cracking,</b> <b>catalytic</b> oxidative cracking results in a relatively higher ratio of high olefins (butylenes + propylene) to ethylene. Thus presence of the catalyst provides a better control over product distribution.

40|$|Energy carriers, such as coal, {{natural gas}} and biomass, can be {{converted}} by Fischer-Tropsch technology into synthetic crude (syncrude). Fischer-Tropsch derived syncrude can then be refined to transportation fuels, such as motor-gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel. These fuels meet the same specifications as crude oil derived transportation fuels. Conventional refining technologies have to be adapted to deal with Fischer-Tropsch syncrudes, because they differ significantly from crude oil with respect to composition. Some of the key differences are the high concentration of oxygenates and olefins and absence of sulphur in Fischer-Tropsch syncrude. Imposing a crude oil refining methodology on syncrude can lead to unwieldy and expensive refineries. Yet, despite an abundance of literature of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, there is little literature that deals with the refining of Fischer-Tropsch syncrude. The present study investigated current refining practice for both crude oil and Fischer-Tropsch syncrude {{in order to identify}} fundamental differences in their refining focus and conversion behaviour. This was followed by a critical evaluation of the compatibility of syncrudes from high temperature Fischer-Tropsch (HTFT) and low temperature Fischer-Tropsch (LTFT) synthesis with the chemistry and catalysis of various conversion processes. The conversion processes that were evaluated include isomerisation, oligomerisation, etherification, alkylation, metathesis, hydrogenation, hydroisomerisation, hydrocracking, catalytic cracking, coking, thermal <b>cracking,</b> <b>catalytic</b> reforming and dehydration. The recommendations from the technology evaluation provided the foundation for the development of Fischer-Tropsch syncrude based refinery designs. Refinery designs were developed to determine configurations that would maximise the production of on-specification motor-gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel respectively. It could be shown that less complex refinery designs were required to refine Fischer-Tropsch syncrude to motor-gasoline and jet fuel, than were required for crude oil refining. It was also shown that on a molecular level Fischer-Tropsch syncrude is unsuited for maximising the production of Euro- 4 type diesel fuel. The present study illustrates the advantage of considering fundamentals in developing refineries specifically for Fischer-Tropsch syncrude, rather than imposing crude oil design practises on Fischer-Tropsch syncrude refinery designs.

40|$|Gas-particle flows {{are used}} in many {{industrial}} applications in the energy, oil and gas fields, such as coal gasification, production of light hydrocarbons by fluid catalytic <b>cracking,</b> <b>catalytic</b> combustion and different treatments aiming to reduce or eliminate pollutants. The particle phase of a gas-particle flow is described by analogy to a granular gas, by finding an approximate solution of the kinetic equation in the velocity-based number density function. In the recent past, many studies have been published on the mathematical modeling of gas-particle flows using hydrodynamic models (e. g. Enwald et al. 1996), where Navier-Stokes-type equations are solved to describe the particle phase as a continuum, computing its stress tensor using moment closures from kinetic theory (Gidaspow 1994). These closures, however, are obtained assuming that the flow is dominated by collisions and near equilibrium, which corresponds to considering a very small particle-phase Knudsen number. This assumption leads to inconsistencies and erroneous predictions of physical phenomena when these models are applied to dilute fluid-particle flows, where rarefaction effects are not negligible. In these flows, the wall Knudsen layers extend inside {{the bulk of the}} fluid, and cannot be accounted for with the simple addition of partial-slip boundary conditions. Recently Desjardin et al. (2008) showed that two-fluid models are unable to correctly capture particle trajectory crossing, seriously compromising their ability to correctly describe any velocity moment for finite Stokes numbers. These authors clarified that the particle segregation captured by two-fluid models for finite Knudsen numbers is artificially high due to their mathematical formulation, which leads to the formation of delta-shocks. In order to overcome these shortcomings, Fox (2008) developed a third-order quadrature-based moment method for dilute gas-particle flows, which has been successfully coupled to a fluid solver to compute dilute and moderately dilute gas-particle flows by Passalacqua et al. (2010) in two dimensions. These authors validated their model against Euler-Lagrange and two-fluid simulations. In this work, the fully coupled quadrature-based fluid-particle code described in Passalacqua et al. (2010) is applied to simulate turbulent gas-particle flow in the riser described by He et al. (2009), using a three-dimensional configuration. This application shows the predictive capabilities and the robustness of the quadrature-based moment method to predict the behavior of gas-particle flows in accordance with experiments (He et al. 2009) ...|$|E
