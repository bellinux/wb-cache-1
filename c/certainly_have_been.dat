5|$|Language and {{personal}} names provide some difficulties. The former {{is an important}} indicator of culture but {{there is very little}} direct evidence for its use in specific circumstances during the period under consideration. Pictish, Middle Irish and Old Norse would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> spoken and Woolf (2007) suggests that a significant degree of linguistic balkanisation took place. As a result, single individuals often appear in sources under a variety of different names.|$|E
5|$|This {{refers to}} the Seven Sleepers, the Catholic legend of seven Christian {{children}}, persecuted for their faith {{during the reign of}} the Roman emperor Decius, who fled to the shelter of a cave where they slept for more than 200 years. Donne, one of six or seven children and a baptised Catholic during a time of strong anti-Catholic sentiment from both the populace and the government, would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> familiar with the story.|$|E
5|$|While Maud is {{described}} in the book as an attractive young woman, not a deformed monster, Uncle Silas is carefully written and plotted, and it is almost certain that Le Fanu explicitly intended a comparison between Maud's situation and {{the legend of the}} wealthy woman living in isolation and desired only for her money. Le Fanu spent his entire life in Dublin and was editor and proprietor of the Dublin University Magazine, and would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> familiar with the legends of the pig-faced woman, and in particular the case of Griselda Steevens.|$|E
60|$|There <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{an exclamation}} of horror {{on the part}} of the ladies at Squire Boatfield's forcible {{expression}} of annoyance, Dame Harrison taking no pains to conceal her disapproval.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{made this}} plan?" [...] asked Rose {{as soon as}} she got the breath which <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> rather taken away by this entirely new and by no means {{agreeable}} scheme.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the others}} {{admitted}} that there <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> wonderful changes, and expressed a fear that if the change in himself was as great, his old pals wouldn't know him.|$|R
5|$|Tuvia Raviv's armored brigade {{began its}} diversionary {{attack against the}} 16th Division's {{bridgehead}} at 5:00 PM on October 15, striking at the bridgehead's center from the east, after a fire preparation. It was repulsed by the Egyptians, as had been expected, but succeeded in its purpose. When the 16th Division's southern flank came under increasing Israeli attack, the Egyptians assumed that the Israeli objective was to roll up the Second Army's right flank, not to open a corridor {{to the west bank}} for Israeli forces to cross the canal. For the next 24 hours, this remained the general impression among Egyptian commanders, and they reacted accordingly. Had they discovered the Israelis' true intentions earlier, the Egyptians would almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to defeat the Israeli operation, in light of the greater strength of their forces and reserves near the Deversoir area, on the east and west banks of the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
25|$|The Mariassalto {{was set up}} at Taranto {{alongside}} the British frogman force in the Mediterranean. Forza was pleased to demonstrate Italian expertise in this area to the British, and the group was also keen to be in action, though if they were caught they would almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shot.|$|E
60|$|He {{admitted}} that it was, and found, {{after a few}} further remarks had passed, that she <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> weeping, there being a suppressed gasp of passionateness in her utterance now and then.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very kind,--more than kind,--perhaps {{somewhat}} too pressing in his kindness. But I find no fault. God forbid that I should. He is, I think, a good man, and <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> good to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that is--why! {{where is}} Christian?" [...] she exclaimed, looking up {{suddenly}} in great surprise, and {{pointing to the}} stool on which the hermit <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> sitting a few minutes before, but which was now vacant.|$|R
25|$|Aradobo – {{based on}} either Joseph Johnson, the first {{publisher}} to employ Blake as a copy-engraver, {{or one of}} the book seller Edward brothers (James, John and Richard). In 1784, James and John had opened a book shop in Pall Mall, with Richard as their apprentice, and Blake would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> familiar with the shop.|$|E
25|$|The {{body parts}} of the large lepidosaurian in the stomach had been made more {{digestible}} by biting them into pieces. According to Dal Sasso & Maganuco the hatchling would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> incapable of achieving this and they considered it a strong indication of parental care as it was improbable the animal had by chance encountered a carcass neatly ripped apart into easily swallowed bits by predators or scavengers.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{praise for}} the conduct of the British troops, their commander Sackville received condemnation for his alleged cowardice and was forced to return home in disgrace. He was replaced by Marquess of Granby. The victory proved crucial, as Frederick had lost to the Russians at Kunersdorf. Had Brunswick been defeated at Minden, Hanover would almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> invaded and the total defeat of Prussia would have been imminent. In the wake of the victory, the Allies advanced pushing the French backwards and relieving the pressure on the Prussians.|$|E
60|$|That might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a woman's speech, but it <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{made in a}} girl's voice. She {{was neither}} shy nor embarrassed nor self-conscious. As she stood back from him {{he could not see}} her face in the dense twilight.|$|R
60|$|Lydie, <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{very strange}} and {{agitated}} in her manner, totally unlike herself: but this mood of course, though so very unusual in her, did not astonish M. le Duc so much, once he realized its cause.|$|R
50|$|The whiptail wallaby {{is present}} in many {{protected}} areas. There appear to be no major threats to this species, although land clearing has probably resulted {{in the loss of}} suitable habitat and <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> responsible for range contraction {{at the southern end of}} its range.|$|R
25|$|The {{quaternary}} {{dedication to}} Ahura Mazda was perhaps {{a compromise between}} orthodox and heterodox factions, with the 8th, 15th and 23rd day of the calendar perhaps originally having been dedicated to Apam Napat, Haoma, and Dahmān Afrīn. The dedication to the Ahuric Apam Napat would almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an issue for devotees of Aredvi Sura Anahita, whose shrine cult was enormously popular between the 4th century BC and the 3rd century AD and who is (accretions included) a functional equal of Apam Napat. To this day these three divinities are considered 'extra-calendary' divinities inasfar as they are invoked together with the other 27, so making a list of 30 discrete entities.|$|E
25|$|When the {{earthquake}} hit, the third {{game of the}} 1989 World Series baseball championship was about to begin. Because of the unusual circumstance that both of the World Series teams (the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics) were based in the affected area, many people had left work early or were staying late to participate in after work group viewings and parties. As a consequence the normally crowded freeways contained unusually light traffic. If traffic had been normal for a Tuesday rush hour, injuries and deaths would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> higher. The initial media reports failed {{to take into account}} the game's effect on traffic and initially estimated the death toll at 300, a number that was corrected to 63 in the days after {{the earthquake}}.|$|E
25|$|On July 29, 2014, it was {{reported}} by the San Antonio Express-News that Mark Davis met with officials {{from the city of}} San Antonio, Texas, to discuss the possibility of relocating the Raiders to San Antonio. Davis confirmed that he did speak with San Antonio city officials while visiting San Antonio to honor former Raiders wide receiver Cliff Branch's induction into a local Hall of Fame, but did not comment on whether he was considering relocation to San Antonio. If the Raiders had relocated to San Antonio, the Alamodome would almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used as a temporary home until a new NFL stadium was built. The Raiders decided against moving to San Antonio, first proposing unsuccessfully to return to its previous home in Los Angeles, then ultimately receiving permission to relocate to Las Vegas by 2020.|$|E
60|$|A slight noise {{suddenly}} {{caused him}} to start. He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> dreaming, no doubt, having fallen {{into some kind of}} torpor, akin to sleep, after the deadly and restless fatigue of the past four days. He <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unconscious of everything around him, of time and of place. But now he felt fully awake.|$|R
60|$|So Mr. Kennedy {{also was}} a member of Brooks's! At the Reform Club there <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> an idea that the number might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> swelled to twenty-one; but then, as Phineas began to understand, nothing was {{correctly}} known at the Reform Club. For an accurate appreciation of the political balance of the day, you must go to Brooks's.|$|R
60|$|That {{sounded like}} boasting, but it wasn't. No, Sir, it wasn't, and Unc' Billy knew it. He knew that Jimmy meant it. Unc' Billy was in despair. He didn't dare stay, and he didn't dare {{go down and}} face Jimmy Skunk, and there he <b>was.</b> It <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a bad night for Unc' Billy Possum.|$|R
25|$|By 1953, four expeditions had {{attempted}} to climb K2. Oscar Eckenstein and Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi had led expeditions in 1902 and 1909 respectively, neither of which had made substantial progress, and the Duke of the Abruzzi had declared after his attempt that the mountain would never be climbed. However, two American expeditions in 1938 and 1939 had come closer to success. Charles Houston's 1938 expedition had established the feasibility of the Abruzzi Spur as a route to the summit, reaching the Shoulder at 8000m, before retreating due to diminishing supplies {{and the threat of}} bad weather. Fritz Wiessner's attempt the following year went even higher, but ended in disaster when four men disappeared high on the mountain. In spite of the tragedy, the expeditions had shown that climbing K2 was a realistic goal, and further attempts would almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made sooner had the Second World War and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 not made travel to Kashmir impossible during the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|A fact {{important}} to the later development of the steam locomotive by others was that, in 1797 and 1798, Richard Trevithick came to live in Redruth {{next door to the}} house where William Murdoch lived (1782 to 1798). Trevithick would have seen and been influenced by Murdoch's experiments, and would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> aware of his work in this area. There is also a story told by Murdoch's son John of a visit by Trevithick and Andrew Vivian to see a model engine in 1794: The model of the wheel carriage engine was made in the summer of 1792 and was then shown to many of the inhabitants of Redruth – about two years after Trevithick and A. Vivian called at my father's house in Redruth... My father mentions that... on that day they asked him to show his model of the wheel carriage engine which worked with strong steam and no vacuum. This was immediately shown to them in a working state.|$|E
25|$|Less than a {{month after}} the {{engagement}} at Plum Point, the River Defense Fleet was again in action against the Western Gunboat Flotilla, but conditions were far from the same. One change {{may or may not have}} had a significant effect on the battle. The strange divided command system of the fleet, in which the guns were manned by artillerymen who were not part of the crews, unraveled in the face of mounting Confederate losses that affected morale adversely. The gunners and rivermen were increasingly at odds, and on at least one occasion the soldiers refused to accompany the fleet on a minor mission. Finally, on 5 June 1862, Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson removed his men. This would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> serious if the rams had been intended to rely on their guns. As it was, the departure of the soldiers affected the fleet only marginally, although it certainly did not help.|$|E
50|$|In 800, Charlemagne {{enlarged}} the hostel at the Muristan in Jerusalem {{and added}} a library to it. He <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> personally in Jerusalem.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the fair}} almost <b>certainly</b> could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> ready for 1907, it was {{postponed}} {{so as not}} to conflict with the Jamestown Exposition. This turned out to be good fortune for Seattle, because 1907 proved to be a bad year for the economy. If the exposition <b>had</b> <b>been</b> held that year it almost <b>certainly</b> would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a financial failure, rather than the success it was in 1909.|$|R
50|$|In addition, as {{the solitary}} eagles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> merged into Buteogallus, the prehistoric Amplibuteo would almost <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> to <b>be</b> merged herein too, {{as it is}} hardly {{distinct}} from Harpyhaliaetus.|$|R
25|$|Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{had been}} in ill health when he stayed at Hugh Paterson’s Bannockburn House and this {{may account for the}} {{questionable}} decisions he made including that to continue the siege of Stirling Castle regardless of the changed conditions that their victory at the Battle of Falkirk had brought them. It has been speculated that had they made a sustained pursuit of the defeated British Army at Falkirk that the castle at Stirling might have surrendered anyway being isolated and without any possible hope of relief. Instead on 19 January 1746 Prince Charles left Lord George Murray with the clan regiments in Falkirk and brought the Lowland Jacobites back to Stirling to reinforce the siege of the castle. The castle would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a major prize for the Jacobites, being at the narrowest point of the British mainland, whether for offensive or defensive purposes, and was at the intersection of the principal axis of Scottish communications from north to south and east to west.|$|E
500|$|Elsewhere in Scotland wheelhouses were constructed, {{probably}} for ritualistic purposes, {{in the west}} and north. Their geographical locations are highly restricted, which suggests that they may have been contained within a political or cultural frontier of some kind and the co-incidence of their arrival and departure being associated with the period of Roman influence in Scotland is a matter of ongoing debate. It is not known whether the culture that constructed them was [...] "Pictish" [...] as such although they would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> known to the Picts.|$|E
500|$|Because of this uncertainty, a co-regency is {{currently}} impossible to prove or disprove. [...] Both Redford's and Murnane's {{works on the}} subject are undecided {{on the grounds that}} there is too little conclusive evidence either for or against a coregency. Even if there was one, it would have made no difference to the chronology of the period because in this kind of institution Amenhotep would have begun counting his regnal dates from his first year as sole ruler. However, co-regency supporters note that since at least one rebellion had been led against Ahmose during his reign, it would <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> logical to crown a successor before one's death to prevent a struggle for the crown.|$|E
6000|$|What {{opposite}} discoveries we have seen! [...] (Signs of true genius, and {{of empty}} pockets.) [...] One makes new noses, one a guillotine, [...] One breaks your bones, one sets {{them in their}} sockets; [...] But vaccination <b>certainly</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> [...] A kind antithesis to Congreve's rockets, [...] With which the Doctor paid off an old pox, [...] By borrowing a new one from an ox.|$|R
60|$|There <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{some talk}} about Appleslocombe during those moments of hot passion in which Lady Kingsbury had {{allowed herself to}} say such evil things of Lady Frances and Lord Hampstead. Whether any {{absolute}} promise <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given she would probably not now remember. There <b>certainly</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a moment {{in which she had}} thought that her husband's life might possibly pass away before that of the old rector; and reference may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> made to the fact that had her own darling been the heir, the gift of the living would then have fallen into her own hands. Mr. Greenwood had probably thought more of some possible compensation for the living than of the living itself. He had no doubt endeavoured to frighten her ladyship into thinking that some mysterious debt was due to him, if not for services actually rendered, at any rate for extraordinary confidences. But before he had forced upon her the acknowledgment of the debt, he was turned out of the house! Now this he felt to be hard.|$|R
