People with disability who were working part-time were more likely to receive a government pension or allowance (41%) than those working full-time (10%).

40|$|Parliaments are the {{institutions}} through which governments are held {{accountable to the}} electorate. They have {{a wide range of}} tools with which to carry out this oversight function, but until recently little analysis had been undertaken on the characteristics or use of such tools. This paper uses data for 83 countries that was collected in 2001 to investigate whether the oversight potential relates to three variables, namely the form of government (presidential, semi-presidential, or parliamentary), per capita income levels, and the level of democracy. The paper finds that oversight potential is greatly affected by the form of government, per capita income levels, and levels of democracy. Countries with parliamentary forms of government, higher income levels, and which are more democratic have a greater number of oversight tools and greater oversight potential. While the oversight potential follows this general trend, the use of committees of enquiry, interpellations and ombudsman offices follows a different pattern. The use of interpellations as an oversight tool is most <b>common</b> in high <b>income</b> countries, less <b>common</b> in low <b>income</b> countries and least <b>common</b> in middle <b>income</b> countries while the presence of committees of enquiry and of the ombudsman offices is most <b>common</b> in middle <b>income</b> countries, less <b>common</b> in high <b>income</b> countries and least <b>common</b> in low <b>income</b> countries.

Accounting for the statutory indexing of transfers, and measuring impacts on annual consumption as a proxy for permanent income, we find that the carbon tax burden is progressive, rising across deciles as a fraction of consumption. The rebate of revenue via transfers makes it even more progressive. In every decile, the standard deviation of the change in consumption as a fraction of consumption varies around 1...|$|R
40|$|When fairly {{homogeneous}} {{taxpayers are}} affected by <b>common</b> <b>income</b> shocks, a tax agency’s optimal auditing strategy consists of auditing a low-income declarer with a probability that (weakly) increases with the other taxpayers’ declarations.

Thus the situation can be realistically modelled as a global game that yields a unique and usually interior equilibrium {{which is consistent with}} empirical evidence.

A simplified version of the model is estimated from stated preference rank-order data, yielding a function that may be interpretated as a conditional indirect utility function. We consider Box-Tukey transformations, segmentation by income class, and a consistent treatment of data at different rank depths using the simultaneous mixed-estimation method. Measures of the household's willingness-to-pay (through rents) for reducing travel times to work and study in the short run, are interpreted as subjective values of time and compared with such values derived from mode choice models. Our results are plausible, and consistent with recent findings showing that the short-run benefits of transport projects derived by transport models are larger than benefits measured at the land use system.

Using {{a panel of}} German income tax return data, we followed taxpayers from 2001 to 2006 to analyze {{the effects of the}} German tax reforms of 2004 and 2005. Implementing a dynamic model as proposed by Holmlund and S 6 derstr 6 m (2011), we are able to disentangle short-term and long-term responsiveness. These estimates allow us to distinguish between different dimensions of behavioral changes: short-term income reactions in contrast to 'real' changes in (reporting) behavior. We compare our results with recent German estimates from the established approach by Gruber and Saez (2002) applied by Gottfried and Witzcak (2009). Following Chetty's (2009) theoretical considerations, we use multiple (tax code related) income concepts and alternative sample choices. We provide several robustness and validity analyses of the most <b>common</b> <b>income</b> concept, i. e. taxable income excluding capital. Our preferred specification yields (very) high short-term yet small long-term elasticites.

40|$|All {{opinions}} {{are those of}} the authors and should not be attributed to the Joint Committee on Recent research on United States levels and trends in income inequality vary substantially in how they measure income. Piketty and Saez (2003) examine market income of tax units based on IRS tax return data, Denavas-Watt, Proctor, and Smith (2012) and most CPS-based research uses pretax, post-transfer cash income of households, while the CBO (2012) uses both data sets and focuses on household size-adjusted comprehensive income of persons, including taxable realized capital gains. This paper provides a crosswalk of income growth across these <b>common</b> <b>income</b> measures using a unified data set. It then uses a more consistent Haig-Simons income definition approach to comprehensive income by incorporating yearly accrued capital gains to measure yearly changes in wealth rather than focusing solely on the realized taxable capital gains that appear in IRS tax return data. Doing so dramatically reduces the observed growth in income inequality across the distribution, but most especially the rise in top-end income since 1989. 1 Much of the debate over the distributional fairness of fiscal policies is discussed in the context of the current distribution of income in the United States and how it has changed ove...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to reveal the gender inequalities in income {{distribution}} for Turkey by using decomposition of Gini coefficient, a <b>common</b> <b>income</b> inequality measure. A new decomposition method, Dagum’s approach for decomposition of the Gini coefficient is used in the study. In the analysis, the decomposition of the Gini coefficient by gender is applied to Turkish individuals twice. First Gini coefficient for total disposable income is decomposed to examine the gender disparities in individual income distribution. Here disposable income inequality is examined on the basis of female–male, illiterate–primary–secondary–tertiary education levels, urban–rural areas, agricultural–non-agricultural sectors. Second, Gini coefficient for wage-income is partitioned to its components to define wage gap between males and females. The wage-income inequality is also examined on the basis of gender, education levels, urban–rural areas, as well as public, private and state economic enterprises (SEE). The data used here are the incomes of Turkish individuals and come from 2005 Household Budget Survey conducted by Turkish Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT). The decomposition of Gini coefficient presented that the contribution of inequalities between genders is more influential in income distribution than in wage-income distribution and the portion of inequality between genders in other income factors to the total income inequality is more than it is in wage-income. Lastly, another class of decomposable income inequality measures, generalized entropy indexes are decomposed by gender and the differences between Gini decomposition and generalized entropy indexes are examined...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} personal income taxation reform in Poland. The proposed changes consist in introducing <b>common</b> <b>income</b> tax. The author sketches the conception of such a tax. Therefore, he discusses specific elements of the income tax construction, such as {{the subject of the}} income tax, its assessment basis, tax-rate, tax reductions and exemptions. The author declares for common taxation of income with one tax. Hence, he proposes to eliminate separate income tax for a non-socialized sector of the economy. Besides, he is also for including into income taxation the income obtained from agricultural activity (from both plant and animal production as well as from special sectors). The above postulate may evoke reservations and cause trouble in its parctical implementation. The introduction of income tax should be preceded by setting the system of personal income and prices in order. Otherwise the tax reform will be of isolated character and of limited importance. In the article the author shows the difficulties connected with the introduction of the said tax. They are of psychological and economic nature. Besides, it is also necessary to analyse in detail the existing tax law in order to eliminate inconsistency and incoherency of tax law regulations. Finally, the author points out to the need of examining American and West German examples of tax law since they contain many solutions which may be interesting from a Polish point of view.
