On 26 October 1971, he became the Chairman of the Planning Committee of the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers.</b> On 23 October 1975, he was relieved of his post as Chairman of the Planning Committee after he suffered a severe heart attack. From 1971 to 1981 he was the Polish representative in the Comecon. In February 1981 he became {{the president of the}} Economy Committee at the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev {{consolidated}} his {{own position}} over the Government Apparatus by strengthening Podgorny's position as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, literally head of state, {{by giving the}} office some of {{the functions of the}} Premier. The 1977 Soviet Constitution strengthened Podgorny's control of the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers,</b> by giving the post of head of state some executive powers. In fact, because of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers</b> became subordinate to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. When Podgorny was replaced as head of state in 1977 by Brezhnev, Kosygin's role in day-to-day management of government activities was lessened drastically, through Brezhnev's new-found post. Rumours started circulating within the top circles, and on the streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{consolidation}} {{to power}} weakened Kosygin's influence and prestige within the Politburo. By the 1970s, when Kosygin's position was given one blow after another, he was frequently hospitalised and at several occasions Kiril Mazurov, the First Deputy {{chairman of the}} <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers,</b> acted on his behalf during Kosygin's absence. Kosygin suffered his first heart attack in 1976. After this incident, {{it is said that}} Kosygin changed from having a vibrant personality to being tired and fed up; he, according to people close to him, seemed to have lost the will to continue his work. He twice filed a letter of resignation between 1976 and 1980, but was turned down on both occasions. During Kosygin's sick leave, Brezhnev appointed Nikolai Tikhonov to the post of First Deputy Chairman of the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers.</b> Tikhonov, as with Brezhnev, was a conservative, and through his post as First Deputy chairman Tikhonov was able to reduce Kosygin to a standby role. At a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, not Kosygin. The powers of the Premier diminished to the point where Kosygin was forced to discuss all decisions made by the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers</b> with Brezhnev.|$|E
5|$|Historian Jerry F.

5|$|Ho Chi Minh, {{who also}} served as the country's President, was {{appointed}} Vietnam's first prime minister in 1946 by the National Assembly, after having served months as Acting Chairman of the Provisional Government and foreign minister {{in the aftermath of}} the 1945 August Revolution. Both the 1946 and 1959 Constitutions state that the National Assembly had the power to appoint and relieve the prime minister of his duties. The prime minister presided over the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers,</b> the highest executive body of state, from 1981 until it was renamed to Government in the 1992 constitution. The office of prime minister was renamed in the 1980 constitution to that of Chairman of the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nikita Khrushchev {{was ousted}} as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) (as well as Chairman of the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers)</b> on 14 October 1964, {{due to his}} failed reforms and {{disregard}} for Party and Government institutions. Brezhnev replaced Khrushchev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin replaced him as Chairman of the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers.</b> Anastas Mikoyan, and later Nikolai Podgorny, became Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Together with Andrei Kirilenko as organizational secretary, and Mikhail Suslov as Chief Ideologue, they made up a reinvigorated collective leadership, which contrasted in form with the autocracy that characterized Khrushchev's rule.|$|E

5|$|When Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers,</b> {{initiated}} the 1965 economic reform the Ministry of Finance sabotaged the reform by not fully implementing it which, {{along with many}} other reasons, helped the reform to fail.|$|E
5|$|In December 1990 Ryzhkov {{suffered}} a heart attack. During his recovery, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union dissolved the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers</b> {{and replaced it with}} the Cabinet of Ministers headed by Valentin Pavlov, Ryzhkov's former Minister of Finance. The law enacting the change was passed on 26 December 1990, but the new structure was not implemented until 14 January 1991 when Pavlov took over as Prime Minister of the Soviet Union. Between Ryzhkov's hospitalisation and Pavlov's election as Prime Minister, Lev Voronin acted as the Chairman of the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ministers.</b> The reorganisation of the government made it subordinate to the Presidency, weakening the head of government's hold on economic policy. In contrast to Hough's view that Gorbachev had little reason to remove Ryzhkov, Gordon M. Hahn argues that there were good reasons to replace him given that with Ryzhkov's Politburo support much reduced, the reformist opposition saw him as a conservative.|$|E
