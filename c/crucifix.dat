5|$|The <b>Crucifix</b> by Cimabue at Santa Croce (c. 1265) is {{a wooden}} <b>crucifix,</b> painted in distemper, {{attributed}} to the Florentine painter and mosaicist Cimabue, one of two large crucifixes attributed to him. The work was commissioned by the Franciscan friars of Santa Croce and is built from a complex arrangement of five main and eight ancillary timber boards. It {{is one of the}} first Italian artworks to break from the late medieval Byzantine style and is renowned for its technical innovations and humanistic iconography.|$|E

5|$|Between 1996 and 1999, the {{administration}} added <b>crucifixes</b> to many classroom walls, {{a change that}} attracted national attention. Before 1996, <b>crucifixes</b> had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms. Some of these <b>crucifixes</b> are historic works of art, and are noted as such. According to Imam Yahya Hendi, the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, pressure to remove the <b>crucifixes</b> comes from within the Catholic community, while he and other campus faith leaders have defended their placement. The Intercultural Center is an exception to this controversy, rotating displays of various faith and culture symbols in the lobby. In 2009, Georgetown's religious symbols were brought back to national attention after the university administration concealed the name of Jesus in preparation for President Barack Obama's speech on campus.|$|R

5|$|The {{church at}} Santa Croce {{was the third}} that the Franciscans {{constructed}} at the site. The first was begun in 1295, and is where Cimabue's <b>Crucifix</b> probably hung, given its large size, above the rood screen. It was later positioned at the north transept, in the sacristy and by the entrance on the southern flank.|$|E
5|$|The <b>crucifix</b> was {{installed}} in the church of Santa Croce {{at the end of}} the thirteenth century and remained there until 1966 when the banks of the Arno river burst and flooded Florence. Thousands of artworks were damaged or destroyed; the <b>Crucifix</b> lost 60% of its paint. It had suffered earlier flood damage in 1333 and 1557. In 1966 it was on display in the lower Museo dell' Opera, which is at a lower elevation and closer to the waterline than the Santa Croce church, where it was located during earlier floods. The water level reached the height of Christ's halo and took large tracts of paint when it retreated. The water deposited oil, mud and naphtha on the wood frame, which further swelled from soakage, forcing the panel to expand and bend, cracking the paint-work.|$|E

5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a <b>crucifix,</b> rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the <b>Crucifix</b> has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E
5|$|His {{eyes are}} open, {{and his skin}} is unblemished. The cross is painted with deep blue paint, perhaps evoking an eternal or {{timeless}} sky. This evocation, not present in the main crucified figure, {{was known as the}} Christus triumphans ("Triumphant Christ"), and for contemporary– especially Franciscan– taste lacked verisimilitude, as it bore little relation to the actual suffering likely endured during a crucifixion, and overly distanced the divine from the human aspect of Christ. From about 1240, painters favoured the Christus patiens ("Suffering Christ") style: a saviour who shared the burden and pain of humanity. The Santa Croce <b>Crucifix</b> is one of the earliest and best known examples of the type.|$|E

50|$|<b>Crucifixes</b> {{made before}} the time of Saint Francis of Assisi {{did not have a}} corpus (body of Christ) and {{therefore}} were adorned with jewels and gemstones, which was referred to as Crux Gemmatae.

The violet colour later evolved as a color of penance and mourning.|$|R

He was also active in the Marches and Emilia-Romagna area. He finally settled in Bologna, where he is known to have executed painted <b>crucifixes</b> but also a fresco in the church of Santo Stefano. His work likely had an influence on local painters and miniaturists.|$|R

Richard continued to resist, hoisting a flag with a Catholic <b>crucifix</b> on it above the castle to taunt the besiegers, but two days later the garrison surrendered.|$|E
