40|$|Wind power {{often is}} a source of voltage {{fluctuations}} and possible voltage issues are raised when considering interconnecting wind turbines to an electric grid. Also, the power electronics introduced in the wind turbines might insert more fluctuations and different PQ problems. Distributed generation seems to be a good option {{in order to try to}} mitigate these problems. The first goal of the work is to create a model of a small electric grid, using MATLAB/Simulink. The models aims to simulate various DFIG wind turbines coupled to the grid in different <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> and wind. Then, the main objective is to analyze the PQ in the grid with this type of turbine. For this, once the simulations have been done, the results obtained have allowed calculating different indices to study PQ in the model.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{nitrogen}} requirements, oil seed rape should be cultivated after rye-grass-clover mixtures (Böhm 2007). But in this case oil seed rape is in competition with wheat, because wheat has a high N-requirement as well. So, the crop rotation must be organized in another way, {{so that there is}} no competition between oil seed rape and wheat. In two-year field trials at the experimental farm of the Institute of Organic Farming (FAL) in Trenthorst the hypothesis was tested, whether oil seed rape with an undersown white clover is a better preceding crop to wheat compared to oil seed rape without underseed. Additionally, the yield was compared to “wheat after ryegrass-clover mixture”. The results showed a higher yield of wheat after oil seed rape with undersown white clover compared to the wheat after oil seed rape without underseed. Only in one year was the yield of wheat after ryegrass-clover mixture about 0. 45 t ha- 1 higher than the yield of wheat after oil seed rape with undersown white clover. Under the given <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>location,</b> the yield of wheat after “oil seed rape with an undersown white clover” is similar to that after ryegrass-clover mixture. So, an integration of oil seed rape in the crop rotation seems possible without a lower yield of wheat...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of crop coefficients for evaporation and transpiration {{is of great}} importance in optimizing irrigation and modeling water and solute transfers in the soil-crop system. In this study we used inverse modeling techniques on soil sensor measurements at depths from the soil-crop system to estimate crop coefficients. An inverse model was rigorously formulated to infer the crop coefficients and the lengths of growth stages using the measured soil water potential at depths during crop growth. By applying a micro-genetic algorithm to the formulated inverse model, the optimum values of the crop coefficient and the corresponding length of growth stage were successfully deduced. It {{has been found that}} the lengths of both the initial and development growth stages of cabbage were 5 Â d shorter than those from the FAO 56 (Irrigation and Drainage Paper by the FAO). The deduced crop coefficient for transpiration at the initial growth stage was 0. 11; slightly smaller than 0. 15 recommended by the FAO 56, while at the mid-season growth stage, the deduced value of 0. 95 was identical with the recommended value. Results show that the predictions of soil water potential using the obtained values of crop coefficients agreed well with the measurements throughout the entire growing period, indicating that the deduced crop coefficients were credible and appropriate for cabbage grown under the specific <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> and climate. It follows that the strategy presented in the study can enable accurate estimates of crop coefficients to be obtained from soil sensor measurements and inverse modeling techniques.

40|$|Winter {{oilseed rape}} {{is the most}} {{important}} oilseed plant grown in the Czech Republic. During recent years, rapeseed sown areas rapidly increased due to its complex usage in industry. Similarly, the rapeseed oil gains importance which is used in food industry. The successful cultivation of rapeseed includes the right cultivation technology as well as the choice of suitable variety which will be the adapted to climatic <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>location.</b> There are over 600 varieties to choose from based on Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species from which is about 80 varieties commonly used in practice in climatic conditions of the Czech Republic. Suitability of these varieties and their yield are tested based on variety testing conducted by ÚKZUZ. The varieties which proved to be suitable based on previous testing are recommended for cultivation and placed in Recommended List of Varieties which helps farmers to orientate in new varieties in the Czech Republic. The aim of this diploma thesis is a comparison of the performance of selected varieties of rapeseed which were cultivated in semi-operational conditions in Humburky, Kralovehradecky region. In this theses yield, oil content, 1000 seed weight were compared. Two hypotheses were set: 1) Hybrid varieties reach higher height and yield 2) Oil content of liner and hybrids cultivars is equivalent Further these features were observed: plant height, pod number on the terminal raceme, stalk number on the terminal raceme, number of primary and secondary branches, height and length of yield floor and their correlation with yield. Cultivar Faktor KWS (hybrid) reached the best yield from selected varieties, yielding 5, 02 t/ ha (119, 2 % average yield). The average yields of liner and hybrids cultivars were almost equivalent (4, 16 t/ha hybrids and 4, 10 t/ha liner). The greatest difference between liner and hybrid varieties was observed in plant height. The hybrids reached 10 cm higher on the average than liner varieties. The second hypothesis about the similar oil content of hybrid and liner varietes was confirmed. Observed varieties reached both 43, 3 % of oil content...|$|E
