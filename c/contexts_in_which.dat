5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is often used in the past tense, however there are some <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E
5|$|Shirokogoroff's and Eliade's {{views of}} shamanism were both {{centered}} on individuals {{and on the}} role of shamans in small groups. Shirokogoroff, for instance, considered eighteenth-century Qing shamanism too formalized to be authentic. Historians of northeast Asia have criticized Eliade's and Shirokogoroff's interpretations because they neglect the political roles of shamans and shamanism's relation with the state. Eliade's claim that shamanism is by essence archaic, individualistic, and socially transgressive led him and his followers to neglect historical <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> shamanism fulfilled political functions or served the needs of the state, as it did under the Qing.|$|E

25|$|The {{implications}} of people's preference for novelty for human relationships are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily {{from studies of}} people's reactions to art objects and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects {{are very different from}} people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us as if we were someone else, for such treatment would pose serious questions about the integrity of people's belief systems. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire for novelty within <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> surprises are not threatening (e.g., leisure activities), while seeking coherence and predictability in <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.|$|E

Additionally, leadership styles that downplay status hierarchies or power differences within an organization and empower people to speak up about their ideas or opinions also help to create cultures that are conducive to creativity.|$|E

25|$|C-PTSD also {{differs from}} {{continuous}} traumatic stress disorder (CTSD), which was {{introduced into the}} trauma literature by Gill Straker (1987). It was originally used by South African clinicians to describe the effects of exposure to frequent, {{high levels of violence}} usually associated with civil conflict and political repression.

25|$|A {{statistical}} learning device {{has also}} been proposed {{as a component of}} syntactical acquisition for young children. Early evidence for this mechanism came largely from studies of computer modeling or analyses of natural language corpora. These early studies focused largely on distributional information specifically rather than statistical learning mechanisms generally. Specifically, in these early papers it was proposed that children created templates of possible sentence structures involving unnamed categories of word types (i.e., nouns or verbs, although children would not put these labels on their categories). Children were thought to learn which words belonged to the same categories by tracking the similar <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> words of the same category appeared.|$|E

25|$|The {{scope of}} the PCMR's duty is broader as it is {{required}} to consider and report on racial matters as well. Although both the PCMR and PCRH act as advisory bodies on certain matters, the <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> advice is given and the recipients of such advice are different. The PCMR advises Parliament on bills, subsidiary legislation, and statutes in force on 9 January 1970, drawing attention to any form of differentiating measures contained in them. The advice provided by the PCRH is to the President, on whether to confirm, vary or cancel a restraining order which the Minister for Home Affairs has issued. Therefore, the PCMR's advisory role largely lies within the legislative process, while the PCRH renders advice on the exercise of executive power.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{possible}} references to reserving the Blessed Sacrament for adoration is found in a life of St. Basil (died AD 379). Basil {{is said to have}} divided the Eucharistic bread into three parts when he celebrated the Divine Liturgy in the monastery. One part he consumed, the second part he gave to the monks, and the third he placed in a golden dove-shaped container suspended over the altar. It is more likely, however, that this separate portion was simply for the purpose of reserving the sacrament for distribution in <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> a communicant could not attend the liturgy, which is a standard practice throughout the ancient churches, even those which do not practice extra-liturgical Eucharistic adoration.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of his {{philosophy}} is a view of humanity as greater than the <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it is placed. He sees each individual possessed of the capability to rise to a greater life. At the root of his social thought is the conviction that the world is made and imagined. His work begins from the premise that no natural social, political, or economic arrangements underlie individual or social activity. Property rights, liberal democracy, wage labor—for Unger, these are all historical artifacts that have no necessary relation to the goals of free and prosperous human activity. For Unger, the market, the state, and human social organization should not be set in predetermined institutional arrangements, but need to be left open to experimentation and revision according to what works for the project of individual and collective empowerment. Doing so, he holds, will enable human liberation.|$|E

500|$|The modern Chinese {{varieties}} make {{frequent use}} of what are called classifiers or measure words. One of the basic uses of classifiers is in phrases in which a noun is qualified by a numeral. When a phrase such as [...] "one person" [...] or [...] "three books" [...] is translated into Chinese, it is normally necessary to insert an appropriate classifier between the numeral and the noun. For example, in Standard Mandarin, {{the first of these}} phrases would be yí [...] rén, where yī means [...] "one", rén means [...] "person", and gè is the required classifier. There are also other grammatical <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> classifiers are used, including after the demonstratives 这 (這) zhè ("this") and 那 nà ("that"); however, when a noun stands alone without any such qualifier, no classifier is needed. There are also various other uses of classifiers: for example, when placed after a noun rather than before it, or when repeated, a classifier signifies a plural or indefinite quantity.|$|E
