40|$|Abstract Background <b>Common</b> <b>warts</b> (verruca vulgaris) are benign {{epithelial}} proliferations {{associated with}} human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Salicylic acid and cryotherapy {{are the most}} frequent treatments for <b>common</b> <b>warts,</b> but can be painful and cause scarring, and have high failure and recrudescence rates. Topical vitamin A {{has been shown to}} be a successful treatment of <b>common</b> <b>warts</b> in prior informal studies. Case The subject is a healthy, physically-active 30 old female with a 9 year history of <b>common</b> <b>warts</b> on the back of the right hand. The warts resisted treatment with salicylic acid, apple cider vinegar and an over-the-counter blend of essential oils marketed for the treatment of warts. Daily topical application of natural vitamin A derived from fish liver oil (25, 000 IU) led to replacement of all the warts with normal skin. Most of the smaller warts had been replaced by 70 days. A large wart on the middle knuckle required 6 months of vitamin A treatment to resolve completely. Conclusion Retinoids should be further investigated in controlled studies to determine their effectiveness in treating <b>common</b> <b>warts</b> and the broad range of other benign and cancerous lesions induced by HPVs. </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUNd: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) {{is a rare}} genodermatosis that is {{characterized}} by susceptibility to infection with specific human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes. Among polyomaviruses, the novel Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) {{has been found in}} different epithelial skin neoplasias. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether EV is associated with cutaneous MCPyV infection. METHODS: We used MCPyV-specific PCR to study skin neoplasms of 6 congenital EV patients and of 1 patient with acquired EV. RESULTS: In all congenital EV patients, MCPyV DNA was found in carcinomas in situ, in invasive squamous cell carcinomas and in <b>common</b> <b>warts.</b> In 4 of these patients, the MCPyV-positive skin lesions were from different anatomic locations. In addition, 1 immunosuppressed patient suffering from acquired EV harbored MCPyV DNA in 2 <b>common</b> <b>warts.</b> In contrast, 7 normal skin samples tested negative for MCPyV DNA. Only 2 out of 24 carcinomas in situ (8. 3 %) and 2 out of 30 <b>common</b> <b>warts</b> (6. 7 %) from immunocompetent individuals were positive for MCPyV DNA. CONCLUSIONS: The strong association of EV-associated skin neoplasms with MCPyV suggests a unique susceptibility of EV patients to infections with MCPyV. Both MCPyV and EV-HPV may act as synergistic oncogenic cofactors in the development of EV-associated skin neoplasms...|$|R

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>wart</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} clinical lesion caused by human papillomaviruses (HPVs). Giant, chronic, isolated, and solitary lesion is uncommon. We reported a case of giant verruca vulgaris in a 66 year-old man on left dorsal pedis that slowly enlarged and hardened in 10 years. It was a solitary hyperkeratotic verruca vulgaris, grey brownish in color, circumscribe, round, and 3 x 2. 4 x 0. 4 cm in size. Histopathologic examination revealed compact hyperkeratosis/orthokeratosis, many koilocytes in the granular and upper spinous layer, acanthosis, and elongated rete ridges that were pointing radially {{toward the center of}} the lesion. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization failed to identify HPV DNA. The patient was successfully treated with salicylic acid 40 % ointment.

40|$|Kidney cells, {{predominantly}} from Cercopithecus monkeys {{but also}} from baboons, were infected in vitro with the SV 40 virus. The infectious cycle was studied with the electron microscope by means of thin sections of cells fixed from 3 hours up to 11 days after infection. The frequency of virus formation and various nuclear and cytoplasmic lesions {{in relation to the}} infection are described. The virus particles appear in the nucleus in close contact with the chromatin. In a small number of cells they have been observed as early as 10 to 12 hours after infection, but most often they appear 24 to 48 hours afterward. Their mean diameter is 33 mµ. They have no membrane and are frequently arranged as crystal-like structures. In addition to the appearance of virus, one observes various lesions in the nucleoplasm and particularly in the nucleolus, which shows an early hypertrophy and produces unusual, dense condensations in contact with the nucleolonema. The importance of these nucleolar lesions and the relationship between the SV 40 virus and the polyoma, <b>common</b> <b>wart,</b> and Shope papilloma viruses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{epidemiological}} studies have identified human papillomavirus (HPV) types 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 27, 57, and 65 in cutaneous <b>common</b> <b>warts.</b> However, {{identification of the}} HPV subtype by con-ventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is time consuming with its multi-step laboratory process. In this study, we aim to develop a specific one-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction method which capably identifies six different HPV genotypes related to <b>common</b> <b>warts.</b> By HPV DNA se-quence analysis, 6 pairs of specific primers were designed from the intergenic regions of genes L 1 to E 6, and from genes E 2 to L 2. DNA sequence analysis with the L 1 gene sequence {{of the sample was}} performed to measure the specificity of multiplex PCR. HPV- 1,- 2,- 3,- 4,- 27, and- 57 were identi-fied without cross amplification in 109 out of 129 samples. The sensitivity and specificity of our set of primers in detecting HPV were 85 % and 99. 5 %, respectively. For the 20 samples where HPV type was not identifiable by our batch of primer sets, multiplex PCR with an additional set of HPV primers was done, where 7 were found positive for HPV- 7 or- 65.

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>warts</b> could {{indicate}} cervical cancer susceptibility, as both {{are caused by}} human papillomavirus (HPV). Eczema was also investigated, as atopic eczema has been negatively associated with warts, but non-atopic eczema {{may be associated with}} compromised host defences, as observed in patients with HIV, suggesting increased susceptibility to HPV infection and cervical cancer. ‘Cervical cancer’ was self-reported during an interview by 87 of 7594 women members of two longitudinal British birth cohorts. The accuracy of the diagnoses is limited by lack of confirmation using medical records. Odds ratios are adjusted for <b>common</b> <b>warts</b> and eczema in childhood; and cigarette smoking, number of cohabiting partners and social class in early adult life. The odds ratios of warts and eczema with cervical cancer are 2. 50 (95 % confidence interval 1. 14 – 5. 47) and 3. 27 (1. 95 – 5. 49), respectively. The association of eczema with cervical cancer is independent of hay fever as a marker of atopy, suggesting the importance of non-atopic eczema. Both heavier smoking compared with non-smoking and four or more cohabiting partners compared with one/none have odds ratios for cervical cancer of 8. 26 (4. 25 – 15. 10) and 4. 89 (1. 39 – 17. 18), respectively. <b>Common</b> <b>warts</b> in childhood may indicate cervical cancer susceptibility; this and the relationship with eczema deserves investigation...|$|R

The wart was analyzed as an axi-symmetric, isotropic solid that protrudes from the skin surface. GAMBIT was used to create the mesh of skin and wart, and FIDAP was used to conduct finite element analysis to model the freezing process. Our results showed that liquid nitrogen was the most effective agent for cryogenic treatment of warts.

40|$|Forty warts from {{different}} patients and of different clinical type were examined histologically and virologically. Eight lesions {{were found to}} be associated with human papillomavirus type 1 (HPV 1), 15 tumors were induced by HPV 2, HPV 3 was detected 4 times, RPV 4 twice, and HPV 6 eleven times. HPV 3, HPV 4, and HPV 6 induced warts revealed a correlation between histology and virus type. They are characterized by the so called “edematous type clear cells”. In HPV 3 associated flat warts pycnotic nuclei were mainly localized in the center of large vacuoles. In genital warts sickle shaped nuclei were pushed to the margin of the vacuolized cells. The histology of HPV 1 and HPV 2 induced warts was more heterogenous. With one exception HPV 1 -induced lesions represented typical myrmecia warts, varying in the number and shape of inclusion bodies. HPV 2 associated common warts, however, revealed 3 very distinct histologic features: (1) Inclusion wart typical for HPV 1, (2) Classical <b>common</b> <b>wart</b> with marked condensation of keratohyalin granules, (3) Warts with extreme vacuolization of squamous and granular cells leading to a honeycomb-like picture...|$|E

Verruca vulgaris (<b>common</b> <b>wart)</b> is an infectious disease caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) that is an important risk factor for cervix cancer (2). A 20 yearold male patient was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) resistant to conventional therapy, three years ago. Treatment with subcutaneous etanercept (50 mg/week) was initiated. The patient responded well to etanercept and this treatment was continued. When the patient last came to the outpatient clinic, he complained that he had numerous warts on his hands. The patient reported that, there was only one and small wart on his right hand before etanercept treatment. He had taken etanercept treatment for three years. During this period, the size and number of warts had increased. In the laboratory analyzes, routine biochemical, hematological, and urine tests were found to be within normal limits.

40|$|Although {{clinical}} criteria, {{laboratory diagnosis}} and treatment are well established, scanty {{attention has been paid}} to prevalence and pattern of viral warts in India. HIV is widely prevalent and its influence on the number and morphology of viral warts has not yet been studied in our setup. Hence, this study was undertaken. One hindered and forty four cases of viral warts were studied between September 2000 and June 2002 at the department of Dermatology and STD, JIPMER, Pondicherry. These included 81 childeren and 63 adults. In Children, viral warts were most commonly seen in the age group of 10 to 14 years (41. 9 &#x 0025;), whereas in adults, the most commonly seen in the age 14 to 20 years (46. 03 &#x 0025;).

40|$|Cryotherapy and {{salicylic}} acid (SA) often fail as treatments for skin warts. We examined {{the effectiveness of}} monochloroacetic acid (MCA) for patients with common or plantar warts. Consecutive patients aged 4 years and older {{with one or more}} newly diagnosed common or plantar warts were recruited in 53 Dutch general practices. We randomly allocated eligible patients to 13 -week treatment protocols of office-applied MCA versus liquid nitrogen cryotherapy every 2 weeks for patients with common warts (n= 188), and MCA versus cryotherapy combined with daily SA self-application for patients with plantar warts (n= 227). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients whose warts were all cured at 13 weeks. In the <b>common</b> <b>wart</b> group, cure rates were 40 / 92 (43 %, 95 % confidence interval 34 - 54) for MCA and 50 / 93 (54 %, 44 - 64) for cryotherapy (risk difference (RD) - 10 %, - 25 - 4. 0, P= 0. 16).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cryotherapy is {{effective}} for <b>common</b> <b>warts,</b> but for plantar warts available treatments often fail. OBJECTIVES: Within a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, we examined whether subgroups of <b>common</b> and plantar <b>warts</b> have a favourable natural course or response to treatment based on wart-associated HPV type. STUDY DESIGN: Consecutive patients with new <b>common</b> or plantar <b>warts</b> were recruited in 30 Dutch family practices. Patients (n= 250) were randomly allocated to liquid-nitrogen cryotherapy, 40 % salicylic acid self-application, or wait-and-see policy. Before treatment, swabs {{were taken from}} all separate warts and analysed by a broad spectrum HPV genotyping assay. At 13 weeks, cure rates with 95 % confidence intervals of <b>common</b> and plantar <b>warts</b> on intention to treat basis were compared between treatment arms for the different wart-associated HPV types. RESULTS: In total, 7 % of swabs tested negative for HPV DNA and 16 % contained multiple types, leaving 278 of 371 common swabs (75 %) and 299 of 373 plantar swabs (80 %) with a single type for analysis. After wait-and-see policy, cure rates were 2 / 70 (3 %, 95 % confidence interval 1 - 10) for HPV 2 / 27 / 57 -associated <b>common</b> <b>warts,</b> 4 / 58 (7 %, 3 - 16) for HPV 2 / 27 / 57 -associated plantar warts, and 21 / 36 (58 %, 42 - 73) for HPV 1 -associated plantar warts.
