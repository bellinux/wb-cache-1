5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during ash fall events. Roads may be closed to allow <b>clean-up</b> of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an ash fall. To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid <b>clean-up.</b> Prioritisation of <b>clean-up</b> operations for critical facilities and coordination of <b>clean-up</b> efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|E
5|$|The memorial's {{location}} {{on a busy}} street corner has caused it to deteriorate, resulting {{in at least two}} recent <b>clean-up</b> and restoration projects. The first involved a <b>clean-up</b> of the granite base, while the second involved more extensive restoration, and was completed in April, 2007 at a cost of $90,000.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} housing market to develop {{estimates}} of the local welfare impacts of Superfund sponsored <b>clean-ups</b> of hazardous waste sites. We show that if consumers value the <b>clean-ups,</b> then the hedonic model predicts that they will lead to increases in local housing prices and new home construction, {{as well as the}} migration of individuals that place a high value on environmental quality to the areas near the improved sites. We compare housing market outcomes in the areas surrounding the first 400 hazardous waste sites chosen for Superfund <b>clean-ups</b> to the areas surrounding the 290 sites that narrowly missed qualifying for these <b>clean-ups.</b> We find that Superfund <b>clean-ups</b> are associated with economically small and statistically indistinguishable from zero local changes in residential property values, property rental rates, housing supply, total population, and the types of individuals living near th...|$|R
40|$|Approximately $ 30 billion (2000 $) {{has been}} spent on Superfund <b>clean-ups</b> of {{hazardous}} waste sites, and remediation efforts are incomplete at roughly half of the 1, 500 Superfund sites. This study estimates the effect of Superfund <b>clean-ups</b> on local housing price appreciation. We compare housing price growth in the areas surrounding the first 400 hazardous waste sites to be cleaned up through the Superfund program to the areas surrounding the 290 sites that narrowly missed qualifying for these <b>clean-ups.</b> We cannot reject that the <b>clean-ups</b> {{had no effect on}} local housing price growth, nearly two decades after these sites became eligible for them. This finding is robust to a series of specification checks, including the application of a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design based on knowledge of the selection rule. Overall, the preferred estimates suggest that the benefits of Superfund <b>clean-ups</b> as measured through the housing market are substantially lower than the $ 43 million mean cost of Superfun...|$|R

5|$|Before privatisation, the King's Cross {{area had}} a {{reputation}} for run-down buildings and prostitution services in front of the main entrance. A major <b>clean-up</b> took place during the 1990s and the station's atmosphere was much improved {{by the end of the}} decade.|$|E
5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid <b>clean-up.</b> Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for <b>clean-up</b> teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the <b>clean-up</b> operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the <b>clean-up.</b> It {{is also possible that}} they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed in the years following Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E

5|$|Preparedness for ashfalls should involve sealing buildings, {{protecting}} {{infrastructure and}} homes, and storing sufficient supplies {{of food and}} water to last until the ash fall is over and <b>clean-up</b> can begin. Dust masks can be worn to reduce inhalation of ash and mitigate against any respiratory health affects. Goggles can be worn to protect against eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|After the cyclone has passed, devastation often continues. Standing {{water can}} cause the spread of disease, and {{transportation}} or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed, hampering <b>clean-up</b> and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their devastating effects, tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward.

5|$|In 1987, almost 200 former cleanup workers took {{legal action}} against the United States. The action was unsuccessful, but {{resulted}} in the release of hundreds of classified documents. The documents revealed that USAF personnel involved in the <b>clean-up</b> were not subsequently monitored for health problems, despite the likelihood of greater exposure to radiation than the Danes. The United States has since instigated regular examinations of its workers. In 1995, the Danish government paid 1,700 workers compensation of 50,000kroner each.|$|E
