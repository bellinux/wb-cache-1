40|$|<b>Chirp</b> spread {{spectrum}} (CSS) is a suitable choice of modulation signals for wireless communications, {{due to its}} inherited advantages such as low transmission power, simplicity of implementation, good interference rejection capability. Linear <b>chirps</b> are common choices in practical CSS systems of binary orthogonal keying (BOK) mode. However, linear <b>chirps</b> generally require the time-bandwidth product of each <b>chirp</b> signal to be 60 sHz or more {{in order to achieve}} desirable orthogonality requirements. Thus, a BOK CSS system based on linear <b>chirps</b> has to occupy very wide bandwidth, which is a very precious resource for wireless communication. Clearly, the requirement on broad frequency bandwidth is a major limiting factor for the widespread adoption of the BOK linear CSS system in practice. To overcome this drawback, it is worthwhile to explore other types of <b>chirp</b> signals outside the linear domain, which can potentially reduce the bandwidth requirement without jeopardizing the system performance. This is the main objective of the current research. In this dissertation, a pair of non-linear <b>chirps</b> has been discovered, which has the potential to replace linear <b>chirps</b> for BOK CSS systems. After exploring desirable properties of non-linear <b>chirps,</b> it is demonstrated that a significant performance advantage on orthogonality over linear <b>chirps</b> can be achieved by a pair of sine or cosine <b>chirps.</b> Subsequently, properties of sine and cosine <b>chirps</b> are analyzed mathematically. Derivations of spectral characteristics, autocorrelation and cross-correlation for both sine and cosine <b>chirps</b> are carried out respectively. Finally, comparison of sine <b>chirps</b> of four different time periods (i. e. half time period, full time period, triple time period, and quadruple time period) are made in terms of their cross-correlation and autocorrelation properties. It has been concluded that full period sine (FPS) <b>chirps</b> are the better choice for this particular application among the sine <b>chirps.</b> Performance of a BOK CSS system based on FPS <b>chirps</b> has been evaluated in three typical scenarios. Firstly, BER (bit error rate) performance of the BOK FPS CSS system in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel is derivated. Furthermore, performance comparison in terms of BERs between linear <b>chirps</b> and FPS <b>chirps</b> is examined. Secondly, effects of Doppler shift on the BOK FPS CSS system are analyzed. The effect of Doppler shift between linear <b>chirps</b> and FPS <b>chirps</b> has been compared. Thirdly, BER performance of the BOK FPS CSS system in a fading environment (Rayleigh channel) has been analyzed. Moreover, BER performance comparisons between linear <b>chirps</b> and FPS <b>chirps</b> in the AWGN+Rayleigh channel with and without a Doppler shift have also been studied. Using analytic means and numerical simulations, this dissertation has conclusively demonstrated that a pair of orthogonal FPS <b>chirps</b> has the capability of replacing linear <b>chirp</b> in BOK CSS systems...|$|R
40|$|Males of {{the field}} cricket Teleogryllus emma produce calling songs that are {{attractive}} to receptive females. The callingsongs of T. emma consist of two components, the long <b>chirp</b> that is composed of up to 12 single pulses, followed by avariable number of short <b>chirps.</b> Based on the analysis of coefficient of variation (CV), temporal characters of the longchirp were less variable {{than those of the}} short <b>chirps</b> in male calling songs. To test for phonotactic selectivity of females,we conducted a single-stimulus playback experiment in which five stimuli (standard, long <b>chirp</b> only, long <b>chirp</b> augmented,short <b>chirps</b> only, and short <b>chirps</b> augmented) were used. The standard stimulus included both long and shortchirps whose characteristics were derived from the calling songs of field populations.

40|$|Discussions {{about the}} {{evolution}} of female mating preferences have often suggested that females should express multiple strong preferences when different male traits are correlated with different mating benefits, yet few studies have directly tested this hypothesis by comparing the strength of female preferences for male traits known to be correlated with different benefits. In the variable field cricket, Gryllus lineaticeps, females receive fecundity and fertility benefits from mating with males with higher <b>chirp</b> rates and life-span benefits from mating with males with longer <b>chirp</b> durations. Although females prefer higher <b>chirp</b> rates and longer <b>chirp</b> durations when the other trait is held constant, {{it is possible that}} they give priority to one of these song traits when both vary. In this study, we examined the relative importance of <b>chirp</b> rate and <b>chirp</b> duration in female mate choice using single-stimulus presentations of songs that varied in both <b>chirp</b> rate and <b>chirp</b> duration. Females expressed both directional and stabilizing preferences based on <b>chirp</b> rate, responding most strongly to a <b>chirp</b> rate approximately one standard deviation above the population mean. Females did not express preferences based on <b>chirp</b> duration, and did not express correlational preferences. These results suggest that females may give priority to the reproductive benefits provided by males that produce higher <b>chirp</b> rates...|$|R

5|$|The Sind sparrow (Passer pyrrhonotus) is a {{passerine}} bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found {{around the}} Indus valley region in South Asia. It {{is also known}} as the jungle, Sind jungle, or rufous-backed sparrow. Very similar to the related house sparrow, it is smaller and has distinguishing plumage features. As in the house sparrow, the male has brighter plumage than female and young birds, including black markings and a grey crown. Distinctively, the male has a chestnut stripe running down its head behind the eye, and the female has a darker head than other sparrow species do. Its main vocalisations are soft <b>chirping</b> calls that are extended into longer songs with other sounds interspersed by breeding males. Historically, this species was thought to be very closely related to the house sparrow, but its closest evolutionary affinities may lie elsewhere. Discovered around 1840, this species went undetected for several decades after its discovery.|$|E

40|$|Synchronising bushcricket males achieve {{synchrony}} by delaying their <b>chirps</b> {{in response}} to calling neighbours. In multi-male choruses, males that delay <b>chirps</b> {{in response to}} all their neighbours would remain silent {{most of the time}} and be unable to attract mates. This problem could be overcome if the afferent auditory system exhibited selective attention, and thus a male interacted only with a subset of neighbours. We investigated whether individuals of the bushcricket genus Mecopoda restricted their attention to louder <b>chirps</b> neurophysiologically, behaviourally and through spacing. We found that louder leading <b>chirps</b> were preferentially represented in the omega neuron but the representation of softer following <b>chirps</b> was not completely abolished. Following <b>chirps</b> that were 20 dB louder than leading <b>chirps</b> were better represented than leading <b>chirps.</b> During acoustic interactions, males synchronised with leading <b>chirps</b> even when the following <b>chirps</b> were 20 dB louder. Males did not restrict their attention to louder <b>chirps</b> during interactions but were affected by all <b>chirps</b> above a particular threshold. In the field, we found that males on average had only one or two neighbours whose calls were above this threshold. Selective attention is thus achieved in this bushcricket through spacing rather than neurophysiological filtering of softer signals...|$|R

5|$|USB2.0 devices use {{a special}} {{protocol}} during reset, called <b>chirping,</b> {{to negotiate the}} high bandwidth mode with the host/hub. A device that is USB2.0 High Speed capable first connects as a Full Speed device (D+ pulled high), but upon receiving a USB RESET (both D+ and D− driven LOW by host for 10 to 20ms) it pulls the D− line high, known as chirp K. This indicates to the host that the device is high bandwidth. If the host/hub is also HS capable, it chirps (returns alternating J and K states on D− and D+ lines) letting the device know that the hub operates at high bandwidth. The device has to receive at least three sets of KJ chirps before it changes to high bandwidth terminations and begins high bandwidth signaling. Because USB 3.0 uses wiring separate and additional to that used by USB2.0 and USB1.x, such bandwidth negotiation is not required.|$|E
