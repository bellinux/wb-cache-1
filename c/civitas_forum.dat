This saw {{the dismantling of the}} Isca fortress, and the site was then abandoned. Around AD 75, work on the <b>civitas</b> <b>forum</b> and basilica had commenced {{on the site of the}} former principia and by the late 2nd century the civitas walls had been completed. They were 3 metres thick and 6 metres high and enclosed exactly the same area as the earlier fortress. However, by the late 4th century the civitas was in decline.|$|E
40|$|Civitas end {{of project}} report (including 65 case studies of bicycle parking {{facilities}} in UK and Europe). CIVITAS - cleaner and better transport in cities - stands for CIty-VITAlity-Sustainability. With the CIVITAS Initiative, the EC aims to generate a decisive breakthrough by supporting and evaluating the implementation of ambitious integrated sustainable urban transport strategies that should {{make a real difference}} for the welfare of the European citizen. CIVITAS I started in early 2002 (within the 5 th Framework Research Programme); CIVITAS II started in early 2005 (within the 6 th Framework Research Programme) and CIVITAS PLUS started in late 2008 (within the 7 th Framework Research Programme). The objective of CIVITAS-Plus is to test and increase the understanding of the frameworks, processes and packaging required to successfully introduce bold, integrated and innovative strategies for clean and sustainable urban transport that address concerns related to energy-efficiency, transport policy and road safety, alternative fuels and the environment. Within CIVITAS I (2002 - 2006) there were 19 cities clustered in 4 demonstration projects, within CIVITAS II (2005 - 2009) 17 cities in 4 demonstration projects, whilst within CIVITAS PLUS (2008 - 2012) 25 cities in 5 demonstration projects are taking part. These demonstration cities all over Europe are funded by the European Commission. Objectives: •	to promote and implement sustainable, clean and (energy) efficient urban transport measures •	to implement integrated packages of technology and policy measures in the field of energy and transport in 8 categories of measures •	to build up critical mass and markets for innovation Horizontal projects support the CIVITAS demonstration projects & cities by: •	Cross-site evaluation and Europe wide dissemination in co-operation with the demonstration projects •	The organisation of the annual meeting of <b>CIVITAS</b> <b>Forum</b> members •	Providing the Secretariat for the Political Advisory Committee (PAC) •	Development of policy recommendations for a long-term multiplier effect of CIVITAS Key elements of CIVITAS: •	CIVITAS is co-ordinated by cities: it is a programme “of cities for cities” •	Cities are in the heart of local public private partnerships •	Political commitment is a basic requirement •	Cities are living ‘Laboratories' for learning and evaluatin...|$|E
