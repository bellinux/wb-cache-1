40|$|Intermetropolitan trade {{areas are}} {{geographical}} zones defined by consumer movements over space -retail flows- from their municipalities of residence towards a head town, to purchase special goods: clothing and footwear, furniture, food, etc. These market areas own an economic sense {{that do not}} have other more commonly used territorial divisions, such as towns, provinces or regions. Since 1992, the Lawrence R. Klein Institute -Autonoma University of Madrid-actualises the Spanish Retail Trade Atlas and determines regional trade areas and sub-areas, using spatial gravity models and survey. The authors' experience in this Project allows them to analyse the different procedures suggested for modelling the consumer store-choice process and from this, estimating the market share of a retail outlet or a town. Store choice models can be classified into two main groups. First, the descriptive-determinist approach includes a group of techniques that rely on observation or normative assumptions. It is well-known the procedure devised by Applebaum (1961) for constructing primary trade areas from <b>customers</b> <b>spotted</b> on a location map or the classical central place theory, based on the nearest-centre hypothesis. 'Reilly's law of retail gravitation' (1931) considers not only distance but also attractiveness of alternative shopping opportunities. Secondly, the explicative-stochastic approach uses information revealed by past behaviour to understand the dynamics of retail competition and how consumers choose among alternative shopping opportunities. Huff was the first to use a utility function and introduced the spatial interaction models to explain consumer behaviour. They argued that consumers rate alternatives {{on the basis of their}} evaluation of the total utility of the store and not merely on its location. Huff's model is a particular case of the discrete-choice models known as multinomial logit (McFadden, 1974). Both models satisfies the so-called 'Independece of Irrelevant Alternatives' (IIA) property, that is, the ratio of the probabilities of an individual selecting two alternatives is unaffected by the addition of a third alternative. While this may be reasonably representative of certain aspatial choice situations, it is very unlikely to occur in spatial choice because of the fixed locations of spatial alternatives. The competing destinations model, derived from purely spatial considerations, provides a way of overcoming some problems with the logit and nested logit models that arise from the transference of essentially aspatial theory to the spatial realm. This work focuses on market area delimitation models and presents the estimation process developed by the L. R. Klein Institute in determining intermetropolitan trade areas. It is also applied a competing destinations model to the trade area of Madrid, a very peculiar one because of its magnitude and the important shopping concentration around the capital. Finally, we want to highlight the main applications derived from the knowledge and actualisation of the consumer retail flows. These applications take into account not only retailing but also another economic activities relating with market attraction areas. ...|$|R

This paper investigates the potential cost savings that could be achieved for different customers by adapting to the hourly pricing scheme. The savings could be attributed to different electrical appliances such as electric heaters, dishwashers and laundry machines. A case study on a number of selected residential customers has been carried out. The study results show that the economic incentives to reschedule loads based on the hourly tariff will be limited for customers without electric heating. Even for customers with electric heating, the economic incentives may be too small to adapt to this hourly tariff...|$|R

40|$|The {{exponential}} growth in mobile technology {{has led to}} a huge change in the retail landscape. As more consumers own smart mobile devices, the possibilities are seemingly endless for firms to engage with <b>customers.</b> Retailers have <b>spotted</b> this opportunity by adhering to consumer demands of extra convenience and offering mobile shopping experiences to their customers as part of their multi-channel retailing strategies. Similar to the introduction of e-commerce, m-commerce is having a major influence in the way businesses and consumers interact. However, what enables a good quality service on these new mobile devices is not well understood. While some research has examined mobile service quality (MSQ) in contexts such as mobile services/networks or M-Banking, the study of mobile shopping service quality has been almost absent in the literature. The present paper builds on the research foundations of Huang et al. (2015) and examines mobile shopping service quality within a conceptual model of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Using a sample of one hundred mobile fashion clothing shoppers, this quantitative study identifies through EFA and CFA procedures four dimensions of MSQ: efficiency, fulfilment, responsiveness and contact.

40|$|A {{huge number}} of papers {{appeared}} in the literature which study the well known Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and its generalizations {{to the case of}} multiple vehicles known as Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). While there exists one and only one TSP, many problems belong to the class of VRPs (see Toth, Vigo (2002)). In the TSP and in the VRPs all customers need to be visited. This means that in the situations modeled all customers are known at the time the optimization model is run and all require service. While this is indeed the case in many practical problems, there are many other practical problems where this assumption is not valid. Let us consider the following situation where a set of customers is given and only a subset has to be selected and served. Nowadays it is more and more frequent that shippers post their demands for transportation service on the web, usually in specific databases, and carriers identify some of those demands and offer their service to the shippers. Usually a carrier has a fleet of vehicles and a set of regular customers that have to be served. If the capacity of the vehicles is not fully used, the carrier may wish to look for <b>spot</b> <b>customers</b> on the web. In this case, the carrier has t...|$|R

In their turn, the customers become more demanding and powerful in their relationship with service providers. They ask for more and new relationship. The appropriate new marketing, known as Relationship Marketing, looks to engage the customer interactively in the many steps of creating value which is later shared between service provider and customer. This requires to focus on long-term customer relationship. In order to establish and maintain long-term relationship, the relationship marketing should understand customer expectations, know the customers, evaluate services process, obtain a proper service quality and adequately manage customersâ relationships. The service customerâs is placed on an expectation range to a five dimension scale and have two levels which may be analyzed into a model of service. A stimulus for relationship marketing performance may be the quality of service. The objective and subjective quality of service is essential for the service customer relationship management. In order to reach the goal of retaining actual customers, service companies should be prepared to <b>spot</b> <b>customers</b> who leave and then analyze and act on information they provide.

40|$|A sound {{positioning}} in consumersâ mind, {{along with}} strong promotion support, brought many retail shops to the top. This is mostly {{thanks to the}} image created in the consumersâ mind. A retail shopâs image may but need not conform to reality. Image often looks like a clichÃ©. It overstates certain elements of the shop while simply omitting others. That is exactly why image is of great importance and often crucial to consumer behavior. This paper aims at determining the impact of image on customer behavior {{in the course of}} decision making about shopping and choosing a particular retail shop. Image is a significant factor of success of every company, hence also of a retail shops. It is a relatively strong value and a component of creating competitive advantage. But if we do not pay sufficient attention to image, it can become counterproductive. Instead to, like an additional value helps creating and maintaining the advantage in competition and realization of business aims, transforms into a limiting factor. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the elements of image that are of greatest importance to customers. Research has shown that customers choose the retail shop first and after that products and brands within this shop. When it comes to the supermarket, as a kind of retail shop, research has shown that two out of three shopping decisions are made by the <b>customer</b> on the <b>spot,</b> that is, without previous planning. That practically means that we can influence customers with different sales techniques. The paper suggests different strategies of image management for supermarkets and conventional shops. For supermarkets it is the âwidest assortmentâ strategy, while for conventional shops the strategy is that of a âselected group of productsâ. Improvements to research methods will enable getting more information about customer behavior, while pressures of increased competition in the business environment will force retailers to get better acquainted with their customersâ whole decision making process...|$|R
40|$|Purpose â The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{portfolio}} procurement framework to response to uncertain customer demand and purchasing price volatility in a simultaneous manner. Then it aims to obtain optimal procurement and production decisions under the portfolio framework to maximize profit. Design/methodology/approach â The portfolio procurement problem is modeled as a dynamic Stackelberg game and Nash equilibrium solutions are obtained. The portfolio procurement framework is analyzed in the settings, with both risk-neutral objective and downside risk constraints measure of contract prices. Findings â By obtaining the Nash equilibrium solutions for both the buyerâs ordering decisions and the supplierâs optimum production decisions, Stackelberg game model for portfolio procurement is proved to be feasible. Additionally, downside risk constrains are proposed to help supply chain participantsâ to evaluate the profitability and risk probabilities of the designed procurement contracts under the uncertain <b>customer</b> demand and <b>spot</b> market. Research limitations/implications â This paper assumes the supplier is risk averse and the buyer is risk neutral, and it would be interesting to examine the performances of portfolio procurement strategy with different risk attitudes participants. Practical implications â This research could help the buyer respond to not only demand uncertainty but also the volatile spot price in the procurement process. Related optimal portfolio procurement strategy can be carried out to improve the enterpriseâ procurement plan by adjusting the order of long-term contract, option contract and the spot market. The proposed framework could also help suppliers design and evaluate contracts for buyers with different risk preference, and on the other hand help the buyers decide if she should accept the contracts from the supplier. Social implications â This research should also increase awareness in both academia and industry on the opportunities of using the dynamic portfolio procurement approach to enhance flexibility and to mitigate the inventory as well as price risks in the procurement process. Effective downside risk constrains on contract prices could also help to protect the bottom line of companies with different risk preference. Originality/value â The portfolio procurement framework proposed in this research can mitigate inventory and price risks simultaneously. Also, instead of solving the portfolio procurement planning problem in computational simulation experiments as in previous research, this paper proposed a dynamic game model for this portfolio-based procurement problem and obtained its Nash equilibrium solutions for both the buyerâs ordering decisions and the supplierâs optimum production decisions. Finally, an innovative and simple downside risk constraints has been designed to help the buyer evaluate supplierâs contract prices according to their individual risk preference...|$|R
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with solving a combined fuel supply vessel scheduling and fuel type allocation problem. The problem is provided by a Hellenic oil company. The company has a small, fixed fleet of fuel supply vessels, which it uses to supply customer ships anchored in the broader area of Piraeus Port outside Athens. The supply vessels are loading multiple types of fuels at refineries before carrying the fuel out to the customer ships. The customers are either mandatory contract ships which must be served, or optional spot ships which may be served if the company has available capacity. The company must decide whether to accept a spot ship or not within only minutes after the inquiry. Based on the contract customers and the accepted <b>spot</b> <b>customers,</b> the company must generate schedules which specify which customers each supply vessel should supply, when this should be done and in what sequence. The planning horizon is three days. The customers specify a time for {{when they want to}} be served, something which must be accounted for in the generated schedules. A given customer ship can place orders of various fuel types to be delivered within the same time interval. All orders placed by a customer ship {{do not have to be}} operated by the same vessel, meaning customer splitting is possible. The fuels demanded must be allocated to compartments within the supply vessels, and fuels of different types cannot be loaded to the same compartment. Conversely, different orders of the same fuel type may be blended within a compartment, and large orders may be split between several compartments. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a detailed optimization model for the problem in order to really getting to know the problem and to study its complexity. This model is intended to serve as a starting point for additional research. Further, we want to utilize the model or variants of this to support the company in its decision making. The model is developed as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem and implemented by use of commercial optimization software. The test cases are generated based on real life information from the company. Due to the complexity of the problem, there is made considerable effort in reducing the numbers of variables and constraints in the implementation of the mathematical model. Valid inequalities and model simplifications are added to the basic model with the intention of further improving the model?s performance. The best solutions were obtained by a model which included both tested model simplifications; stowage elimination and no customer splitting. To get feasible solutions with respect to the real allocation problem, the vessels? total capacities had to be set as low as 50 % of the actual vessel capacities. The model with this capacity fraction performed well on test cases of smaller sizes, but in larger test cases this low capacity limits the possibility of obtaining solutions where all demand is met. The problem is very complex and consequently not easy to solve, but we have seen that simplifying complicating model aspects reduces the model?s complexity and makes the model better able to support the company in its decision making. Still, with regards to support the decision making, there is a need for further research. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue for}} the project {{is that some of}} the rear axles for General Motors GMT 800 and GMT 900 are found to be leaking. Most of the leaks are spotted already at the paint {{facility}} Paint Tech International (PTI), but some make it all the way to the <b>customer</b> before being <b>spotted.</b> The leaks are normally discovered as a wet spot around the vent tube area on the differential, or in more severe cases as a puddle of lube around the pinion flange. The leak has already been isolated to the interface between the vent and a plastic cap covering it during manufacturing and assembling. The project is a Design for Six Sigma project, and follows the IDDOV cycle. IDDOV offers a systematic approach to find and eliminate causes of variation in a process. IDDOV stands for Identify, Define, Develop, Optimize and Verify. The purposes of this project are to find out why some axles leak and to suggest a design or process change to reduce the number of leaking axles. The area of the leaks was verified and the strategy to be used was decided in the projects phase. The project was broken down into two categories: process study and design study. The process study made comparisons against axles of other sizes as well as differences between different GM assembly plants. In the design study a capability study was made, which showed some shortcomings in the vent, cap and the amount of lube injected in each axle. A component search without any reliable results was also done here. The most interesting finding was from the process study which showed differences in the manufacturing processes between the 8. 6 â axle and the 11. 5 â axle. The 11. 5 â axle got new fresh caps after the paint process to make sure the axle had been pressure equalized. To find out if the vent and cap pairs are affected by the heat that are applied to them in the manufacturing process, a design of experiments was made in two steps. The first step was to see if heat had an impact, and the second step was later done, with some additional factors, to more precisely determining the impact. From the study, heat and time in the oven were found to impact the amount of pressure it takes to pop off the plastic cap of from the vent. By that it is known that the heat treatment is weakening the cap. A process improvement was made early in the project. All 8. 6 â axles have now their caps pulled for a few seconds at PTI. The cap is then replaced when the pressure inside the axle has been equalized. Since the process change, interaction has been held with GM regularly to make sure no axles leak anymore. GM has also made a test to confirm that the axles do not leak anymore. The total amount of savings from the project is estimated to be about $ 29, 000. The suggestion for process change, based on the findings of the project, is to continue with the ongoing task of removing and replacing the caps at PTI. Preferably a new cap should be used instead of the old one, to separate the equalized axles from the nonequalized ones, and also since the cap does get deformed by the heat earlier in the manufacturing process.
