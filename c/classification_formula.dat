Indications were given a positive value and contraindications were given a negative value. The result of this strategy is that one strong indication will outweigh multiple weak contraindications. In the end, our intent was for the student’s most complex uses of composite units to determine the stage classification. However, even strong inferences are still just inferences. Therefore, we thought it was important that, as in a clinical interview, a pattern of strong contraindications be given importance as well.|$|R

40|$|In {{the absence}} of {{biological}} markers, dementia classification remains complex {{both in terms of}} characterization as well as early detection of {{the presence or absence of}} dementing symptoms, particularly in diseases with possible secondary dementia. An empirical, statistical approach using neuropsychological measures was therefore developed to distinguish demented from non-demented patients and to identify differential patterns of cognitive dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease. Age-scaled neurobehavioral test results (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Revised and Wechsler Memory Scale) from Alzheimer's (AD) and Huntington's (HD) patients, matched for intellectual disability, as well as normal controls were used to derive a <b>classification</b> <b>formula.</b> Stepwise discriminant analysis accurately (99 % correct) distinguished controls from demented patients, and separated the two patient groups (79 % correct). Variables discriminating between HD and AD patient groups consisted of complex psychomotor tasks, visuospatial function, attention and memory. The reliability of the <b>classification</b> <b>formula</b> was demonstrated with a new, independent sample of AD and HD patients which yielded virtually identical results (classification accuracy for dementia: 96 %; AD versus HD: 78 %). To validate the formula, the discriminant function was applied to Parkinson's (PD) patients, 38 % of whom were classified as demented. The validity of the classification was demonstrated by significant PD subgroup differences on measures of dementia not included in the discriminant function. Moreover, a majority of demented PD patients (65 %) were classified as having an HD-like pattern of cognitive deficits, in line with previous reports of the subcortical nature of PD dementia. This approach may thus be useful in classifying presence or absence of dementia and in discriminating between dementia subtypes in cases of secondary or coincidental dementia...|$|E
40|$|A new {{supervised}} classification algorithm of a heavily distorted pattern (shape) obtained from noisy observations of nonstationary signals is {{proposed in the}} paper. Based on the Gabor transform of 1 -D non-stationary signals, 2 -D shapes of signals are formulated and the <b>classification</b> <b>formula</b> is developed using the pattern matching idea, which is the simplest case of a pattern recognition task. In the pattern matching problem, where a set of known patterns creates predefined classes, classification relies on assigning the examined pattern {{to one of the}} classes. Classical formulation of a Bayes decision rule requires aprioriknowledge about statistical features characterising each class, which are rarely known in practice. In the proposed algorithm, the necessity of the statistical approach is avoided, especially since the probability distribution of noise is unknown. In the algorithm, the concept of discriminant functions, represented by Frobenius inner products, is used. The classification rule relies on the choice of the class corresponding to the max discriminant function. Computer simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new classification algorithm. It is shown that the proposed approach is able to correctly classify signals which are embedded in noise with a very low SNR ratio. One of the goals here is to develop a pattern recognition algorithm as the best possible way to automatically make decisions. All simulations have been performed in Matlab. The proposed algorithm can be applied to non-stationary frequency modulated signal classification and non-stationary signal recognition...|$|E
40|$|Link-based {{classification}} (LBC) is {{the problem}} of predicting the class of a target entity given the attributes of entities linked to it. A natural approach to LBC is to upgrade standard classification methods from the single-table learning. In this thesis, we propose two algorithms for upgrading decision tree and Bayes net learners for LBC. One of the issues that make LBC difficult compared to single table learning is the large number of different types of dependencies that a model may have to consider. A principled way to approach the complexity of correlation types is to consider model classes with explicitly stated independence assumptions. We define two independence assumptions weaker than relational naive Bayes assumption to formulate our <b>classification</b> <b>formulas.</b> We investigate the performance of our models on three real world datasets.

40|$|Transmission {{easement}} is a {{right to}} the things of others, {{and in that sense}} it is a limited right in rem. It {{should be noted that the}} transmission easement may apply to infrastructure which does not have to be related to the energy sector as stated in art. 49 of the Civil Code (as well as the expected entries in the Government's draft amendments of the Civil Code of 2011) and the proposed provisions in the bill on transmission corridors of 2012. The existing provisions in civil law gave great opportunities to determine what can be classified as transmission facilities and what cannot. The proposed changes in the civil law do not change the wide range of interpretation of the "transmission device", they rather adopt an even wider <b>classification</b> <b>formula.</b> The solutions in the bill on transmission corridors will be the lex specialis, which will result from the need for implementation by the state and local authorities of the function to ensure public services or services of economic interest. We should also stress the need to ensure energy security by the state, which is associated with the guarantee of supply and operation of the transmission grid. Poland awaits the need to prepare the network for increased energy demand and changes in the structure of energy (nuclear power and renewable energy sources). The text presents some problems with the transmission easement based on civil law (including the draft of amendments to Civil Code) and administrative law (the bill on transmission corridors). The text does not discuss in details the issues of compensation, which is provided by legal solutions on the basis of administrative law and civil law. The main issues which were analyzed in this work are: (1) an overview of the institution of transmission, (2) the scope of restrictions on transmission easement, (3) the term "transmission equipment" especially on the basis of article 49 CC, (4) how to interpret the qualifications of equipment as "transmission equipment", (5) transmission corridors, (6) the effects of establishing transmission easement in transmission corridors. Legal changes prepared at the turn of 2011 / 2012 on the basis of the Civil Code and administrative law are the result of low efficiency of the existing regulations. In the case of the prepared changes to the Civil Code the privileged legal position of transmission undertakings should be pointed out. However, the new regulations developed under the bill on transmission corridors stem from the need to ensure by the state and local authorities the effective implementation of the security functions of public services or services of economic interest. Additional factors which contributed to the regulation of transmission easement on the basis of administrative law are affected by the obligations of the Polish state in the diversification of the energy structure – especially the question of increase in the share of RES in the obtained electricity. Moreover, Poland is facing a growing demand for energy and the problem of not very good infrastructure. This paper analyzes the transmission easement institution based both on Polish civil law and legal solutions prepared on the basis of Polish administrative law. In the first case the analyzed solutions contained in the Civil Code (together with the prepared amendments to the regulations on transmission easement). In the second case there was discussed the analysis of selected transmission easement regulations, which are contained in the bill on transmission corridors. The paper presents an analysis of the following issues: (1) the institution of transmission easement, (2) the constraints on transmission easement, (3) the term "transmission facilities" – both on the Civil Code and the bill on transmission corridors, (5) transmission corridors and effects of setting in their area transmission easement. However, the issue of compensation related to the establishment of easements on the basis of civil law and administrative law has not been further discussed here...|$|E

Using GSAS dataset, the formulas for predicting different glaucomatous optic disc appearances were established. The GSAS dataset containing three-dimensionally-analyzed optic disc topographic parameters from 187 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma was assessed with discrimination analyses to obtain formulas predictive of glaucomatous optic disc appearances: focal ischemic (FI); generalized enlargement (GE), myopic glaucomatous (MY), and senile sclerotic (SS). Using 38 optic disc parameters-substituted discrimination analyses with a stepwise forward-selection method, six parameters (temporal and nasal rim-disc ratios, mean cup depth, height variation contour, disc tilt angle, and rim decentering absolute) were selected into the formulas. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for predicting the four disc types with established formulas were 0. 88, 0. 91, 0. 93, and 0. 86 for FI, MY, SS, and GE, respectively.

The first approach gives satisfactory results and better matches Classification Society Rules. The only problem {{is represented by the}} determination of beam geometry which implies the determination of the shell portion cooperating with the reinforcement. The width of this strip, called “Effective Breadth Be”, depends on several geometric characteristics like the shell thickness t, the beam span L, the beam distance B and the dimensions of the beam transverse section. In the case of steel plates the relationships between the above parameters and Be is well known and several procedures are available in literature and provided by the Classification Societies rules for determining the effective breadth. More uncertainties exists for what GRP structures are concerned.

Given a Boolean {{formula and}} a {{satisfying}} assignment, a flip is {{an operation that}} changes {{the value of a}} variable in the assignment so that the resulting assignment remains satisfying.

Our result adds to the small set of complexity results known for shortest reconfiguration sequence problems by providing an example where the shortest sequence can be found in polynomial time even though its length is not equal to the symmetric difference of the values of the variables in s and t. This is in contrast to all reconfiguration problems studied so far, where polynomial time algorithms for computing the shortest path were known only for cases where the path modified the symmetric difference only. ...|$|R
