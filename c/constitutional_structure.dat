5|$|In the 12th century, {{under the}} Hohenstaufen {{emperors}} (1138–1254), German princes increased their influence further {{south and east}} into territories inhabited by Slavs; they encouraged German settlement in these areas, called the eastern settlement movement (Ostsiedlung). Members of the Hanseatic League, which included mostly north German cities and towns, prospered in the expansion of trade. In the south, the Greater Ravensburg Trade Corporation (Große Ravensburger Handelsgesellschaft) served a similar function.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{constitutional}} linkages between national legal orders, the EU legal order, and the ECHR Convention system. The first, and the main, question the article addresses is how these intertwined <b>constitutional</b> <b>structures</b> can be described. This article shows that the interrelationship of these legal orders could be best described as heterarchical as opposed to hierarchical. The article also tries to tentatively examine the meaning and influence of these heterarchical <b>constitutional</b> <b>structures.</b> The concept of heterarchy is used to illustrate the tension between constitutionalism and pluralism. Where constitutionalism builds a pre-set foundation and framework for governance, pluralism challenges hierarchical <b>constitutional</b> <b>structures</b> and highlights tension at the interfaces between different legal orders. The concept of heterarchical <b>constitutional</b> <b>structures</b> is used to describe those structures pertaining between legal orders which enable those legal orders to flexibly function together without predetermining any hierarchical relation between the orders. Thus heterarchical <b>constitutional</b> <b>structures</b> {{can be described as}} communicative in nature. The structures could also be described soft by their nature since they describe, but do not determine relations between different legal orders...|$|R

The design was updated in 1921, to incorporate changes to the appearance of Canada's coat of arms, and again in 1931, to reflect developments in Canada's <b>constitutional</b> <b>structure</b> {{brought about by the}} Statute of Westminster, whereby the governor general became the personal representative of the monarch of Canada, rather than a representative of the British monarch in Canada, as it was previously.|$|E

According to the ICTY indictment of Milošević, when the proposed amendments were put before the Kosovo Assembly, the majority of the Assembly's members abstained in protest and the vote failed to reach the necessary two-thirds supermajority. The Speaker of the Assembly nonetheless declared that the amendments had passed and they were duly enacted. This however was refuted in court by Vukasin Jokanovic who was the President of the Kosovo Assembly at the time during the trial. He provided the court with a video recording of the vote along with the stenographic notes of the assembly session which clearly showed the assembly members voting in favor of the constitutional amendments by the required majority.|$|E

The insurgents under Thomas Dorr had armed themselves and proposed to install a new state constitution. Before such acts, Rhode Island had been following the same <b>constitutional</b> <b>structure</b> that was established in 1663. Tyler called for calm on both sides, and recommended that the governor enlarge the franchise to let most men vote. Tyler promised that in case an actual insurrection should break out in Rhode Island he would employ force to aid the regular, or Charter, government. He made it clear that federal assistance would be given only to put down an insurrection once underway, and would not be available until violence had taken place. After listening to reports from his confidential agents, Tyler decided that the 'lawless assemblages' had dispersed and expressed his confidence in a [...] "temper of conciliation as well as of energy and decision" [...] without need of federal forces. The rebels fled the state when the state militia marched against them, but the incident led to broader suffrage in the state.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} innovative, pooled time-series, cross-section (TSCS) regression models for 18 OECD countries (1971 – 2001) to explore the impact of executive ideology alternation and <b>constitutional</b> <b>structures</b> on welfare state change. Unlike other approaches in comparative welfare state research, the models specified in this paper focus not on the content or direction, but {{on the extent of}} change. Interaction effects between executive ideology alternation and <b>constitutional</b> <b>structures</b> are emphasized. The paper suggests that the effect of party ideology is particularly strong in political systems that concentrate power in the executive. In these systems, ideological differences from one cabinet to another lead to considerable policy change. Contrarily, systems with considerable degrees of consensus-based policy making are not only characterized by lower levels of welfare state change, but ideological differences of successive cabinets are more likely to lead to policy gridlock...|$|R

[...] The DFD displayed several of the features of a political party, and was allocated a (fixed) quota of seats in the national parliament ("Volkskammer") by the SED. [...] Malter herself was a member both of the People's Council ("Volksrat") and of the national parliament ("Volkskammer") which emerged from it, between 1948 and 1954. [...] During 1949/50 she served as a member of the parliamentary presidium. [...] Although she was, naturally, a member of the ruling SED (party), she sat in the Volkskammer not as a representative of the SED but as a representative of the FDGB which, like the DFD, enjoyed the status of an officially mandated mass organisation, and was allocated its own quota of seats in the Volkskammer.

"challenges directed only [...] exercises of congressional power." [...] "A constitutional objection to [...] "a particular Executive Branch action arguably authorized by [...] Act [...] " [...] will not suffice." [...] In further support of their position that Flast was limited to acts of Congress the government also cited decisions of Appeals Court of the Second Circuit, namely In re United States Catholic Conference, 885 F.2d 1020 (1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 918 (1990) and Lamont v.

40|$|Net {{neutrality}} is {{no longer}} only a battle cry of a few Internet romancers but {{has evolved into a}} key value for contemporary society that is being institutionalised as a constitutional right. With the help of sociological systems theory, this text argues that the social and legal institutionalisation of constitutional rights need to be distinguished. Commonly, constitutional rights emerge from society before they are reformulated in the legal realm. Using the example of the United States, the paper shows empirically that net neutrality is about to emerge as a new fundamental value and right. Its constitutionalisation is happening bottom-up, driven by social movements, Internet activists and advocacy groups, and further, in an interweavement of civil society dynamics with the legal system. The question is whether <b>constitutional</b> <b>structures</b> have already become identifiable. The last section discusses the relationship between social and formal <b>constitutional</b> <b>structures</b> from a legitimacy and democracy perspective...|$|R

But while the move may have been unusual, there is nothing in the text of the Constitution’s pardons clause to suggest that he exceeded his authority. The president, the clause says, 'shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.' The pardon power extends only to federal crimes. Otherwise, presidents are free to use it as they see fit.

40|$|This paper traces how the Supreme Courts of Canada and the United States {{have each}} used the basic {{guarantee}} of adjudicative fairness {{in their respective}} constitutions to effect revolutions in their countries’ criminal justice systems, through two different jurisprudential models for this development. It identifies a relationship between two core <b>constitutional</b> <b>structures,</b> the basic guarantee and enumerated rights, and shows how this relationship can affect {{the degree to which}} entrenched constitutional rights actually protect individuals. It explains that the different models for the relationship between the basic guarantee and enumerated rights adopted in Canada and the United States, an “expansive view” and a “narrow view” respectively, changed the degree to which entrenched rights protected individuals. It offers an historical context for these developments, and gives a comparison between a heretofore unexamined parallel in the jurisprudential developments surrounding the basic guarantee in both countries. It then suggests how these different models for the relationship between the fundamental <b>constitutional</b> <b>structures</b> protecting individual rights in the criminal process will respond to the most significant threats to individual rights from the political branches in decades, {{as a result of the}} global war on terrorism...|$|R
