40|$|BACKGROUND Two {{varieties}} {{exist in}} the Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dog</b> breed, namely hairless Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dogs</b> presenting with hypotrichosis and dentition abnormalities, and the coated powderpuffs. Hairless Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dogs</b> are obligate heterozygotes for a FOXI 3 mutation, and this phenotype is classified {{as a form of}} canine ectodermal dysplasia. OBJECTIVES We provide a detailed histological description of hair follicles and their density for the three subphenotypes (true hairless, semi-coated and powderpuffs) of Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dogs.</b> Apocrine and exocrine glands of the skin and other tissues were compared with findings reported from dogs with X-linked ectodermal dysplasia. ANIMALS Skin biopsies were collected from 22 Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dogs.</b> Additionally, the glands of the skin and other tissues were examined from another two dogs available for postmortem examination. METHODS Skin biopsies and tissues were processed, stained and evaluated in a blinded fashion. RESULTS Hair follicular anomalies decreased with increasing number of hairs in the different phenotypes. The FOXI 3 mutants had only simple primary hair follicles, whereas the nonmutant powderpuffs had compound follicles identical to other dog breeds. All Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dogs</b> had an anagen-dominated hair cycle. Furthermore, apocrine glands in the skin and respiratory mucous glands of the mutant Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dogs</b> were present and normal. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE We have identified striking histopathological differences between the three subphenotypes of Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dogs.</b> We clearly demonstrated distinct differences between the canine ectodermal dysplasia in Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dogs</b> and dogs with X-linked ectodermal dysplasia...|$|R

50|$|The Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dog</b> is a hairless {{breed of}} dog. Like most hairless dog breeds, the Chinese crested comes in two varieties, {{with and without}} fur, which are born in the same litter: the Powder Puff and the Hairless.|$|R
50|$|This {{unimproved}} grassland {{site has}} a rich variety of flora. There are grasses such as creeping bent, meadow foxtail, sweet vernal-grass, <b>crested</b> <b>dog's</b> tail, perennial rye-grass and rough-stalked meadow-grass.

50|$|The site {{supports}} {{grasses and}} herbs which {{are typical of}} wet neutral meadows. Species include narrow-leaved water-dropwort (Oenanthe silaifolia), {{which is one of}} the largest populations in Great Britain. There is <b>crested</b> <b>dog's</b> tail, meadow foxtail, meadow buttercup, great burnet and meadow vetchling. The national scarce mousetail is recorded for this site (one of three locations in Gloucestershire).|$|R
25|$|Follicular {{dysplasia}} is {{a genetic}} disease of dogs causing alopecia, or hair loss. It {{is caused by}} hair follicles that are misfunctioning due to structural abnormality. There are several types, some affecting only certain breeds. Diagnosis is achieved through a biopsy, and treatment is rarely successful. Certain breeds, such as the Mexican Hairless <b>Dog</b> and Chinese <b>Crested</b> <b>Dog,</b> are bred specifically for alopecia.|$|R
50|$|Drivers Hill {{consists}} {{of a number of}} fields and two small woods. The fields contain some species of flower typical of old pasture, such as <b>crested</b> <b>dog's</b> tail, oval sedge and lady's bedstraw. The larger wood, which is at the north of the site, is called Wentworth Hall Wood, and has a canopy mainly of pedunculate oak and ash. The other wood, in the south-west corner, is dominated by oak and sycamore.|$|R
50|$|The meadows are characterised by {{sweet vernal grass}} (Anthoxanthum odoratum) and an {{abundance}} of herbs including several lady’s mantle species Alchemilla spp., wood cranesbill (Geranium sylvaticum), ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata), hay rattle (Rhinanthus minor), self-heal (Prunella vulgaris) and pignut (Conopodium majus). Other species found include <b>crested</b> <b>dog’s</b> tail (Cynosurus cristatus), downy oat grass (Avenula pubescens), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), field woodrush (Luzula campestris), pale sedge (Carex pallescens) and red clover (Trifolium pratense).|$|R
40|$|Mexican hairless dogs (xoloitzcuintles) were {{considered}} sacred by the Aztecs,and statues {{of the dogs}} date back 3700 years. Hairless dogs were described as Canis aegyptius by Linné (1). The phenotype of hair-less dogs is now classified as canine ectoder-mal dysplasia (CED) because these dogs have missing or abnormally shaped teeth {{in addition to a}} hair coat that is sparse or absent (Fig. 1). CED is inherited as a monogenic autosomal semidominant trait (2) linked to chromosome 17 (CFA 17) (3) in Mexican and Peruvian hairless dogs and in Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dogs.</b> Heterozygous dogs are hairless, and homozygous mutants die during embryogenesis.

The study did not find a close genetic relationship between Xoloitzcuintle and the Chinese <b>Crested</b> <b>Dog,</b> another hairless breed that is cited by the American Kennel Club as an ancestor to the Xoloitzcuintle. The modern Xoloitzcuintle appears to be a result of a mixture of the aboriginal, pre-Columbian Xoloitzcuintle, itself a descendant of a domesticated dog that came with the ancestors of indigenous Americans from Asia, with one or more southern European herding dog breeds during the Columbian Exchange.|$|R

40|$|Mexican and Peruvian hairless <b>dogs</b> and Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>dogs</b> are {{characterized}} by missing hair and teeth, a phenotype termed canine ectodermal dysplasia (CED). CED is inherited as a monogenic autosomal semidominant trait. With genomewide association analysis we mapped the CED mutation to a 102 -kilo-base pair interval on chromosome 17. The associated interval contains a previously uncharacterized member of the forkhead box transcription factor family (FOXI 3), which is specifically expressed in developing hair and teeth. Mutation analysis revealed a frameshift mutation within the FOXI 3 coding sequence in hairless dogs. Thus, we have identified FOXI 3 as a regulator of ectodermal development...|$|R
5000|$|At first look, the Hairless and Powderpuff {{varieties}} of Chinese <b>crested</b> <b>Dogs</b> {{appear to be}} two different breeds, but hairlessness is an incomplete dominant trait within a single breed. The Hairless has soft, humanlike skin, as well as tufts of fur on its paws ("socks") and tail ("plume") and long, flowing hair on its head ("crest"). In addition to being an incomplete dominant gene, the [...] "hairless" [...] gene has a prenatal lethal effect when homozygous. Zygotes affected with double hairless genes (1 in 4) never develop into puppies, and are reabsorbed in the womb. All hairless Cresteds are therefore heterozygous.|$|R

40|$|Ragwort (Jacobaea vulgaris syn. Senecio jacobaea), {{a common}} weed of pasture and poorly managed land worldwide, is toxic to {{livestock}} and horses. There is no fully satisfactory control option available. The {{aim of the}} work described in this thesis {{was to assess the}} potential of root infecting pathogens to cause disease in ragwort, and to examine the possibility of using them as biological control agents against this weed. Thirty-six root infecting isolates were obtained from ragwort roots, collected from a nationwide postal survey where Pony Club adult leaders were asked to provide samples. Twenty-one of these were identified as Fusarium spp. by morphological identification and tested for the ability to cause disease on aseptically raised ragwort seedlings. Twelve isolates demonstrated virulence towards ragwort when measured by disease score over a 14 day period. These isolates were identified by molecular means using the internal transcribed spacer and translation elongation factor genes, as either Fusarium avenaceum or F. acuminatum while isolates of F. solani, F. redolens, F. cerealis or F. culmorum did not exhibit virulence except one isolate of F. culmorum which was weakly virulent. To investigate the biological control potential of virulent isolates, a representative of F. avenaceum and F. acuminatum plus the one weakly virulent F. culmorum isolate, were tested against plants of agricultural importance in grasslands. Six grasses (<b>crested</b> <b>dogs</b> tail, Cynosurus cristatus; Timothy, Phleum pratense; red fescue Festuca rubra; Italian ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum; and two varieties of perennial ryegrass, L. perenne) were unaffected by inoculation with any of the isolates. There {{was no significant difference between}} the symptoms caused by F. avenaceum and F. acuminatum on ragwort, red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (T. repens). F. culmorum was more virulent towards white clover than either red clover or ragwort. This suggests that although high concentrations of pure PA may inhibit fungal growth, the range of other nutrients in the plants can counteract this negative effect.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{experimental}} study was to evaluate the physiologic bone remodeling in beagle dogs following the placement of small-diameter (3. 25 mm) implants in fresh extraction sites. Five 1 -year-old beagle dogs that weighed approximately 10 to 13 kg each were used in this study. The third and fourth premolars (P 3, P 4) were used as experimental teeth, which were hemisected using a fissure bur; the distal roots were removed carefully using forceps. Implants (3. 25 -mm wide, 10 - or 11. 5 -mm long) {{were placed in the}} fresh extraction sockets with the neck of the implant {{at the level of the}} buccal bone <b>crest.</b> The <b>dogs</b> were subsequently put to sleep according to the following schedule: one dog 15 days after implant placement, two dogs after 1 month, and the remaining two dogs after 3 months. The distance from the implant shoulder to the bone wall crest was measured at both the buccal and lingual sites. The width of the buccolingual bone crest was measured using a caliper. Assessments were made immediately after root extraction and at 2, 4, and 12 weeks after implant placement. The mean width of the buccolingual bone crest was 4. 5 ± 0. 5 mm at the time of root extraction. Subsequently, at 2, 4, and 12 weeks after implant placement, the buccolingual bone width was 4. 1 ± 0. 5 mm, 3. 7 ± 0. 3 mm, and 3. 5 ± 0. 7 mm, respectively. Two weeks after implant placement, the lingual bone crest was measured at 0. 2 ± 0. 3 mm from the implant shoulder, while the buccal bone crest was 0. 3 ± 0. 3 mm. After 4 weeks of healing, the mean distance from the implant shoulder to the lingual bone crest was 0. 1 ± 0. 9 mm, compared to 0. 4 ± 0. 9 mm for the buccal bone crest. After 12 weeks of healing, the bone crest at the lingual sites was - 0. 3 ± 0. 5 mm from the implant shoulder, compared to 0. 8 ± 0. 3 mm at the buccal sites. The findings from this study show that although vertical bone remodeling was indeed observed, the mean vertical buccal bone resorption was 0. 5 mm. It might be suggested, therefore, that the implant position along the lingual wall and the use of implants with a narrow diameter in relation to the extraction socket width play a key role in reducing the rate of vertical bone resorption at the buccal aspect of implants placed in fresh extraction sockets...|$|R
