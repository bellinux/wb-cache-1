25|$|Ricoeur also {{invoked the}} notion of distanciation when {{interpreting}} and understanding others. For Ricoeur, distanciation is two-fold: a) humans always interpret from a distanced position via their physical and experiential proximity to the experiences being discussed (i.e., they were not always there when it happened), and b) {{there will always be}} a distance between their experiences and their interpreted truths and meaning of those experiences. While imagination enables hermeneutic therapists to understand their clients and empathize with their experiences, {{there will always be a}} distance between what the therapist imagines and the actual embodied experience of the client. Ironically, it is this concept of distanciation that invokes the therapist's responsibility to make the attempt, to get as close as is possible, because without breaching that surface, truth and meaning are limited in their <b>co-creation.</b> Hermeneutic counseling theory states that a therapist and a client cannot work together to co-create meaning without empathically envisioning and understanding one another.|$|E

2500|$|For {{indigenous}} {{cultures of}} the Americas, storytelling is used as an oral form of language associated with practices and values essential to developing one's identity. This is because everyone in the community can add their own touch and perspective to the narrative collaboratively - both individual and culturally shared perspectives {{have a place in}} the <b>co-creation</b> of the story. Oral storytelling in indigenous communities differs from other forms of stories because they are told not only for entertainment, but for teaching values.

40|$|This thesis aims to {{increase}} {{understanding of what}} motivates consumer-to-consumer (C 2 C) sharing of co-creative advertising campaigns on social media platforms. Consumer use of the Internet has increased immensely, and affects organisations due {{to the growth of}} consumer-to-consumer interactions, such as word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth is a powerful form of advertising because of consumer trust in their social media networks, therefore, it is crucial for organisations {{to increase}} C 2 C sharing as a form of advertising, and in particular, co-creative advertising campaigns. To achieve this aim, this study used a grounded theory approach, to gather a comprehensive amount of data to discover theoretical propositions about the phenomenon. A total of ten unstructured depth interviews were conducted before theoretical saturation was reached. The results of the study found that consumer motivations to share <b>co-creations</b> online were pride, and to connect with others, conceptualised by social media self-presentation, and a consciousness of others. Whilst consumer motivations to participate in co-creative advertising campaigns were escapism and self-interest. The primary implication of these findings is understanding how organisations can influence consumer motivations to share <b>co-creations</b> online, hence, organisations advertising, by increasing personal connections that consumers can use to connect with others in consumer-to-consumer platforms online...|$|R

30|$|Recent brand {{relationship}} {{research has}} {{paid attention to}} brand love, brand credibility, and brand loyalty.

We review relevant literature on brand relationship and risk avoidance and develop research hypotheses about brand relationship and risk. We find that consumers’ risk avoidance influences brand trust, brand credibility, brand loyalty, and brand choice overload. We suggest implications about how brand relationships can promote social network markets and open business innovations through social construction process.|$|R

2500|$|Kirby grew {{increasingly}} dissatisfied with working at Marvel. There {{have been a}} number of reasons given for this dissatisfaction, including resentment over Stan Lee's increasing media prominence, a lack of full creative control, anger over breaches of perceived promises by publisher Martin Goodman, and frustration over Marvel's failure to credit him specifically for his story plotting and for his character creations and <b>co-creations.</b> He began to both script and draw some secondary features for Marvel, such as [...] "The Inhumans" [...] in Amazing Adventures, as well as horror stories for the anthology title Chamber of Darkness, and received full credit for doing so; but in 1970, Kirby was presented with a contract that included such unfavorable terms as a prohibition against legal retaliation. When Kirby objected, the management refused to negotiate any contract changes. Kirby, although he was earning $35,000 a year freelancing for the company, subsequently left Marvel in 1970 for rival DC Comics, under editorial director Carmine Infantino.|$|R
40|$|Together {{universities}} and universities of applied sciences (UASs) form {{the higher education}} system as a dual model in Finland.

30|$|Recent {{research}} on brand relationships such as brand love, brand credibility, brand loyalty and brand choice overload suggests several {{important aspects of}} global marketing. One is for an interaction between brand relationships and social network markets. Recent emerging creative markets in various market areas involve intensive collaborations and networks based on brand trust, love, and credibility. In market and society, collaborations and <b>co-creations</b> derived from brand relationships generate various social network markets and open business innovations (Potts, et al., 2008 a; 2008 b). Currently, creative collaborations emerge from public institutions to nonprofit organizations, to universities, to business companies through constructive relationships between providers and customers (Krishna, 2014; Kodama and Shibata, 2015). Networks change the picture of market and technology through knowledge diffusion and collective intelligence (Surowiecki, 2004; Yun et al., 2015). It is expected that emerging brand networks from current brand relationships can significantly influence current market power through new digital technologies in a global network market. Our findings about brand relationships and risk avoidance will contribute to exploring various relationships between brands and customers {{and the role of}} brand communities involved in open innovation of fashion industry.|$|R

50|$|In 1993 McFarlane {{contracted}} Neil Gaiman, {{along with}} three other recognized authors, Alan Moore, Dave Sim, and Frank Miller, to write one issue of Spawn. While doing so, Gaiman introduced the characters Angela, Cogliostro, and Medieval Spawn. All three characters were co-created and designed by series creator Todd McFarlane. The series continued to feature all of the characters after Gaiman's involvement ended. Some characters had tie-ins with McFarlane's toy company, and Cogliostro had {{a prominent role in}} the live-action movie in 1997. McFarlane had initially agreed that Gaiman retained creator rights to the characters, but later claimed that Gaiman's work had been work-for-hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman's <b>co-creations</b> entirely, pointing to the legal indicia of Spawn #9 and the lack of legal contract stating otherwise. McFarlane had also refused to pay Gaiman for the volumes of Gaiman's work that McFarlane republished and kept in print. In 2002, Gaiman filed suit and won a sizable judgment against McFarlane and Image Comics for the rights due any creator. All three characters were then equally co-owned by both men. In 2012, McFarlane and Gaiman settled their dispute, and Gaiman was given full ownership of Angela.|$|R
40|$|What do {{emotions}} do?” asks Sara Ahmed. Emotions, feelings, {{senses and}} affects are complex, slippery concepts. They shape, circulate between and connect bodies, {{they belong to}} individuals and to collectivities alike, they reside inside, within us and outwith when they are released outwards towards others defining the contours of different interpellated subjectivities. ‘Feelings-in-common’, collective feelings are brought about by impressions left by bodily others (Ahmed, 2004). Geographers argue that affects are intangible and ineffable yet a virtual force existing as a subsurface of latent bodily responses. Senses refer to those percepts that help tourists become aware of and interpret something through which meaning {{is given to the}} toured place. There is increasing interest in the sensuous in tourist studies (Crouch & Desforges, 2003), and our session seeks to further this interest considering connections between emotions, feelings, affects and senses in tourism. In this session, papers are invited that advance emotional, affectual and sensory geographies of tourism. Emotions, feelings, affects and senses cannot be divorced from one another and from the body, these take place within and around the body (Davidson & Milligan, 2004). We encourage paper submissions to address the question: What do embodied emotions, feelings, senses and affects do in tourism? Submissions can examine individual emotions (fear, joy, happiness, pride, shame and the like), or senses working alone or in concert, or they can address more broadly theoretical and methodological <b>co-creations</b> and co-performances of emotions, feelings and senses in tourism studies...|$|R
40|$|Attachment theory {{predicts that}} family {{bereavement}} leads even securely attached individuals to experience temporary attachment insecurity. Attachment in/security is displayed through the way narratives are constructed, and the Adult Attachment Interview posits particular indices of ‘narrative incoherence’ for narratives related to experiences of bereavement. This thesis explores bereaved families’ therapy narratives {{to see if}} they display signs of narrative incoherence or evidence of lack of resolution as predicted by attachment theory. The thesis also examines whether there is evidence of shifts and changes changes in the stories over time that could be understood as reflecting a move towards greater coherence. Families are dynamic systems and the stories told in family therapy are <b>co-creations</b> between family members and the therapists: the impact of the actions of family members and therapists on narrative coherence are also analysed. Five bereaved families’ narratives were recorded during the therapy intervention ‘Telling the Story’, at the beginning and towards the end of their family bereavement therapy. An Attachment Theory informed Thematic Analysis was carried out on the transcripts and identified four themes: Evidence of Unresolved Loss, Creating Incoherence, Creating Coherence and Evidence of Coherence. Results show that there is, as predicted by the Adult Attachment Interview, evidence of narrative incoherence, and additionally there are behavioural and systemic features that create further incoherence in the narratives. The results also show how coherence can be created and what features a more coherent family story includes. The findings have implications for bereavement therapy interventions, therapist training and methodological development. Limitations and suggestions for further research are also discussed...|$|R
