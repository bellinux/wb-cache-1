40|$|An angle Ω {{is defined}} {{to serve as}} a metric for global {{side-chain}} orientations, which reflects the orientation of the side <b>chain</b> <b>relative</b> to the radial vector {{from the center of the}} protein to an amino acid. The side-chain orientations of buried residues exhibit characteristically different orientations than do exposed residues, in both monomeric and dimeric structures. Overall, buried side chains point mostly inward, whereas surface side chains tend to point outward from the surface. This difference in behavior also correlates well with the residue hydrophobicity; so a global side-chain orientation can be viewed as a direct structural manifestation of hydrophobicity. When various solvent-accessible layers are considered, the behavior is relatively continuous between centrally located and exposed residues. In the case of interfacial residues between subunits, there are statistically significant differences between exposed residues and interface residues for ALA, ARG, ASN, ASP, GLU, HIS, LYS, THR, VAL, MET, PRO, and overall the interface residues have an increased tendency to point inward.

Examination of mouse light-chain RSS indicates that kappa light-chain RSS consistently show a greater degree of similarity to a consensus sequence than do those of lambda light chain. To determine whether this difference in natural RSS could affect the patterns of light-chain gene rearrangement and expression, we have constructed recombination substrates containing both a typical mouse kappa RSS pair and a typical mouse lambda RSS pair.

A TEM-stable expanded phase {{can be obtained by}} intercalating n-alkylammonium ions between the silicate layers of a parent biotite. The vermiculite particles were embedded in Spurr resin and centrifuged to improve orientation.

Lattice images of biotite, Ba-vermiculite and octylammonium-vermiculite, the latter showing aperpendicular rangement of the alkyl <b>chains</b> <b>relative</b> to the silicate layers, were obtained with a resolution ~ 2 A. The reliability of these images was confirmed by computer simulation. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for investigating structural defects and deformations in layer-silicates (Brown & Rich, 1968; Lee et al., 1975; Amouric et al., 1981; Vali & K 6 ster, 1986).

For both proximity induced and intrinsic local attractive interaction induced superconductivity, a fully gapped intervalley pairing state is favored in this system, which is an equal superposition of the singlet and the m= 0 triplet for the lack of centrosymmetry.
