A kilowatt-pumped <b>burst</b> <b>amplifier</b> is presented delivering broadband 1. 4 mJ pulses with a spectral bandwidth supporting sub- 7 fs pulse duration.

40|$|Abstract:Quality of the Colour Composite {{video signal}} {{has become the}} basic {{criteria}} of today’s TV transmission systems (Terrestrial / Satellite / Cable). Video streaming is increasingly finding its way in day-to-day lives of people. The videos typically passes through several processing stages {{before they reach the}} end user. The effect of most processing stages is to degrade the quality of the video that passes through it. The only reliable method to assess the video quality perceived by a human observer is to ask human subjects for their opinion, which is termed subjective video quality assessment (VQA). Subjective VQA is impractical for most applications due to the human involvement in the process. Hence we go for objective analysis, which includes the verifying Colour Composite Video Signal parameters like sync pulses, <b>colour</b> <b>burst</b> and the luminance. The need to have a low cost video switcher and a CCVS analyzer with high performance and to easily carry the analyzer equipment from one place to other i. e., a portable system, made us to develop the low cost microcontroller based automatic video switcher and CCVS analyzer.

50|$|In {{practice}} {{however, the}} recovery of this colour information from telerecordings is highly complex for several reasons. Firstly, the colour reference timing signal, known as the <b>colour</b> <b>burst,</b> is absent from telerecordings, as it is nominally {{off the edge of}} the visible screen area being recorded. This timing has to effectively be recovered since the phase of the chroma dots, which is represented by their horizontal position on the screen, determines the hue of the reconstructed colours. Distortions in the geometry of the telerecordings due to the nature of physically recording from a non-flat CRT screen onto film means that a transformation has to be applied in order to infer the original positions of the chroma dots within the broadcast.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{topology}} of PON, {{the transmission}} modes for downstream (that is, from OLT to ONU) and upstream (that is, from ONU to OLT) are different. For the downstream transmission, the OLT broadcasts optical signal {{to all the}} ONUs in continuous mode (CM), that is, the downstream channel always has optical data signal. However, in the upstream channel, ONUs can not transmit optical data signal in CM. Use of CM would result {{in all of the}} signals transmitted from the ONUs converging (with attenuation) into one fiber by the power splitter (serving as power coupler), and overlapping. To solve this problem, burst mode (BM) transmission is adopted for upstream channel. The given ONU only transmits optical packet when it is allocated a time slot and it needs to transmit, and all the ONUs share the upstream channel in the time division multiplexing (TDM) mode. The phases of the BM optical packets received by the OLT are different from packet to packet, since the ONUs are not synchronized to transmit optical packet in the same phase, and the distance between OLT and given ONU are random. Since the distance between the OLT and ONUs are not uniform, the optical packets received by the OLT may have different amplitudes. In order to compensate the phase variation and amplitude variation in a short time (for example within 40 ns for GPON), burst mode clock and data recovery (BM-CDR) and <b>burst</b> mode <b>amplifier</b> (for example <b>burst</b> mode TIA) need to be employed, respectively. Furthermore, the BM transmission mode requires the transmitter to work in burst mode. Such a burst mode transmitter is able to turn on and off in short time. The above three kinds of circuitries in PON are quite different from their counterparts in the point-to-point continuous mode optical communication link.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown in the past that pulsed laser systems {{operating}} in the so-called “burst mode” are a beneficial approach to generate high peak power laser pulses at high repetition rates suitable for various applications. So far, most high-energy burst-mode laser systems put great effort into generating a homogeneous energy distribution across the burst duration, e. g., by shaping the pump pulse. In this work, we present a new shaping technique, which is able to produce arbitrary energy distributions within the burst by pre-shaping the seed pulse burst with a Pockels cell. Furthermore, this technique allows for the precompensation of any static modulations across the burst, which may be introduced during the subsequent amplification process. Therefore, a pulse burst with a uniform energy distribution can also be generated. The method is tested with an ultra-short pulse <b>burst</b> mode laser <b>amplifier</b> system producing <b>bursts</b> of a 1 ms duration with a pulse repetition rate of 1 MHz and a maximum output power of 800 W during the burst.

Real-time respiration rate (RR) was measured during CA storage and regular fruit sampling carried out to assess disease severity, objective colour, ethylene production and firmness. The automated in situ set-up used allowed continuous recordings of real-time respiration measurements without disruption to the CA environment. Cold stored strawberry fruit treated for 2. 5 d with CA midway through the storage period were firmer and maintained a more vibrant <b>colour</b> despite <b>bursts</b> of increased RR. Furthermore, just 2. 5 d of CA was sufficient to extend the shelf-life of strawberries (based on disease incidence) by a further 3 d, as compared to control.

At 5 °C, avocado skin colour and internal discolouration were positively affected by the mid CA treatment. These results {{are discussed in the}} context of the targeted use of CA, compared to control, for extending shelf-life, and reducing waste of these two different fruit produces. Furthermore, reducing the length of time required for CA application, which has not previously been explored in avocado or strawberries, would potentially be more energy efficient/cost effective...|$|R

NiO materials have been widely studied as counter electrodes for complementary electrochromic devices, in particular, smart windows. The world leading institutions on NiO efforts include National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Uppsala University. Another example of an electrochromic material is polyaniline which can be formed either by the electrochemical or chemical oxidation of aniline. If an electrode is immersed in hydrochloric acid which contains a small concentration of aniline, then a film of polyaniline can be grown on the electrode. Depending on the oxidation state, polyaniline can either be pale yellow or dark green/black. Other electrochromic materials that have found technological application include the viologens and polyoxotungstates.|$|R

The ages of the SSPs are from 0. 5 to 19. 5 Gyr and the metallicities range from 0. 0001 to 0. 03. We include a variety of prescriptions for the initial mass function (IMF) in our investigation, including different choices for the lower and upper mass cut-offs to the distribution, as well as the slope. We find that the age, the metallicity and the lower mass cut-off all play an important role in determining the integrated colours of the instantaneous burst SSPs. In particular, variations in the choice of IMF can lead to deviations of up to 0. 47 mag and 2. 25 mag in integrated B -V and V -K colours, respectively. Conversely, we find that altering the rate of mass loss in a stellar wind, or the choice of the upper mass cut-off to the IMF, does not have a significant effect on the results. We also investigate the discrepancies that exist between the results of various SSP studies. We compare the isochrones and the colour-temperature calibrations adopted in each of these studies, and estimate the deviations owing to the choice of stellar models, spectral library, and/or IMF. We find that the deviation arising from changes in the IMF is greater than that caused by changes to the evolutionary models or spectral calibrations utilized by each study. Therefore, the form of the IMF should be chosen with care when conducting SSP studies...|$|R
40|$|Recently, themobilemarket {{has grown}} tremendously and mobile devices have become {{ubiquitous}} and indispensable {{in our daily}} life. This introduced a new era for themobile market where the main focus {{is to reduce the}} cost and power consumption of battery supplied devices. The power amplifier is a key component in all wireless communication systems. In most of today’s smartphones and other mobile devices, the RF Power Amplifier is predominantly designed in a more exotic technology. To reduce the cost and environmental footprint, it is desirable to completely integrate the RF PA and the entire transceiver into a single system-on-chip (SoC). In addition, the new wireless and mobile communication standards introduce new challenges for fully-integrated power amplifiers. One major challenge is the efficient generation of a Watt-level output power despite the low-breakdown voltage in nanometer scale technologies. As the voltage dropswith the technology scaling, not only the output power and efficiency, but also the stringent requirements on linearity become significantly harder. Certainly, due to the increased data rate, high linearity over instantaneous wide bandwidth is needed in future mobile communication standards. Unlike analog and RF circuitry, digital circuits benefit from technology scaling. Therefore, if a PA is used in switched mode, voltage linearity is not required. A switched-mode PA (SMPA) cannot amplify amplitude modulated (AM) signals, but using techniques such as pulse width modulation (PWM), the amplitude information can be encoded in the time domain and hence efficiently amplified. This thesis manuscript addresses the major challenges of integrating linear and simultaneously highly efficient PAs and PA architectures in standard nanometer technologies in the frequency range from 900 MHz to 5 GHz. In total, four different PAs have been designed: two linear RF PAs, one linear RF PA with integrated power detector and finally a reconfigurable digital RF PA. All RF PAs are designed to cope with several major challenges for fully-integrated RF PA design. The first linear PA is a two-stage power amplifier with a clover-shaped distributed active transformer (DAT) combiner in a standard 90 nm CMOS technology targeting the LTE-communication standard. This test chip achieves the required Watt-level output power for all modern mobile communication standards: an output power of 29. 4 dBm is delivered to the antenna with 25. 8 % power added efficiency (PAE). The RF PA was evaluated with a 10 MHz 16 -QAM LTE uplink signal with 7 dB PAPR for LTE-band VIII in the 900 -MHz range. Experimental results show that all stringent linearity requirements are satisfied with 15 %PAE at an average output power of 25. 1 dBm, which is more than the required 23 dBm average output power level. Due to the implementation of a linearity improvement technique, the second RF PA, fabricated in a 180 nm SOI RF PA, is highly linear even over a wide instantaneous bandwidth. This high linearity over a wide bandwidth is required for all future mobile communication standards. The performance of the RF PA is observed for a 64 -QAM 20 MHz LTE-advanced uplink signal (PAPR= 8. 8 dB). This second RF PA delivers a 22. 4 dBm with 21. 7 % PAE, while simultaneously obey all linearity requirements. In addition, the RF PA achieves similar performance at LTE-band I (1. 9 GHz) up till LTE-band VII (2. 5 GHz) The high linearity of the RF PA allows to transmit a LTE-advanced uplink signal even up to a 60 MHz instantaneous bandwidth with a 10. 3 dB PAPR efficiently. Since the power amplifier is the most power hungry building block in a transmitter, the third linear RF PA is integrated together with an on-chip power detector in a 40 nm standard CMOS technology. The on-chip power detector detects both the RF output current and the RF output voltage to monitor the output power of the RF PA and hence is able to measure the output power even for non-fixed 50 Ohm load. The power detector introduces a sense winding to measure the RF output current. The RF PA is a single stage RF PA using transformer-based input and output matching to support the 5 GHz WLAN IEEE 802. 11 ac communication standard. With continuous wave signals, the RF PA achieves 38. 8 %PAE and a drain efficiency of 49. 9 %at a 24 dBm output power. With a 40 MHz 64 -QAM WLAN signal at 5 GHz, the RF PA transmits 16. 9 dBm while operating with 17. 3 % efficiently. Finally, a burst-mode RF transmitter was presented to achieve efficiency enhancement. A fully-integrated Burst Mode transmitter has been realized using aforementioned fully integratedWatt-level RF PA togetherwith a baseband PWMmodulator processed in 65 nm standard CMOS, designed by P. Nuyts. During Burst-Mode operation, the RF PA operates always in saturation. And at 930 MHz, it has a gain of 31 dB at low duty cycles and drops to 29 dB at peak output power. It implies that the variation over the whole duty cycle range is limited to 2 dB. This proves the inherent linear behavior of the <b>burst</b> mode <b>amplifier.</b> At 100 % duty cycle, the power amplifier delivers a peak output power of 28. 8 dBm with 23. 7 % PAE. While applying a 20 MHz WLAN IEEE 802. 11 b/g to the PA, the RF PA achieves 11. 7 % PAE at 23. 1 dBm average output power, where the EVM limit is reached. The transmitter clearly satisfies the industry-based LTE EVM specification of 5. 6 % for output powers ranging from about 14 to 23 dBm. This proved the potential for a single chip design. Consequently, a fourth single chip fully-integrated reconfigurable multilevel PWM transmitter was designed in a 40 nm standard CMOS. To fully-digital multi-level RF PA is implemented in a 40 nm standard CMOS process to generate a multi-level PWM signal {{and at the same time}} achieve the required watt-level output power for modern mobile systems. This RF PA architecture uses transformer-based series power combiner to sum the output power of several power amplifiers. Due to the multi-mode operation, simulations show still 3. 5 times more efficiency at 15 dB back-off than a conventional Class B amplifier. Simultaneously, this multi-mode RF PA extends the dynamic range by 15 dB and hence doesn’t constrain this digital transmitter architecture to modulated signals with only low PAPR. Due to technical issues, experiments could never confirm the multi-level operation nor the 3. 5 times more efficiency than a conventional Class B at 15 dB back-off.

"This river {{does not}} see the naked sky, [...] 540 [...] Till it begins to {{progress}} silverly [...] Around the western border of the wood, [...] Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood [...] Seems at the distance like a crescent moon: [...] And in that nook, the very pride of June, [...] Had I been used to pass my weary eves; [...] The rather for the sun unwilling leaves [...] So dear {{a picture of his}} sovereign power, [...] And I could witness his most kingly hour, [...] When he doth lighten up the golden reins, [...] 550 [...] And paces leisurely down amber plains [...] His snorting four. Now when his chariot last [...] Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast, [...] There blossom'd suddenly a magic bed [...] Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red: [...] At which I wondered greatly, knowing well [...] That but one night had wrought this flowery spell; [...] And, sitting down close by, began to muse [...] What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus, [...] In passing here, his owlet pinions shook; [...] 560 [...] Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook [...] Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth, [...] Had dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth [...] Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought, [...] Until my head was dizzy and distraught. [...] Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole [...] A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul; [...] And shaping visions all about my sight [...] Of <b>colours,</b> wings, and <b>bursts</b> of spangly light; [...] The which became more strange, and strange, and dim, [...] And then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim: [...] 571 [...] And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell [...] The enchantment that afterwards befel? [...] Yet it was but a dream: yet such a dream [...] That never tongue, although it overteem [...] With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring, [...] Could figure out and to conception bring [...] All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay [...] Watching the zenith, where the milky way [...] Among the stars in virgin splendour pours; [...] 580 [...] And travelling my eye, until the doors [...] Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight, [...] I became loth and fearful to alight [...] From such high soaring by a downward glance: [...] So kept me stedfast in that airy trance, [...] Spreading imaginary pinions wide. [...] When, presently, the stars began to glide, [...] And faint away, before my eager view: [...] At which I sigh'd that I could not pursue, [...] And dropt my vision to the horizon's verge; [...] 590 [...] And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge [...] The loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er [...] A shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar [...] So passionately bright, my dazzled soul [...] Commingling with her argent spheres did roll [...] Through clear and cloudy, even when she went [...] At last into a dark and vapoury tent-- [...] Whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train [...] Of planets all were in the blue again. [...] To commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd [...] 600 [...] My sight right upward: but it was quite dazed [...] By a bright something, sailing down apace, [...] Making me quickly veil my eyes and face: [...] Again I look'd, and, O ye deities, [...] Who from Olympus watch our destinies! [...] Whence that completed form of all completeness? [...] Whence came that high perfection of all sweetness? [...] Speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O where [...] Hast thou a symbol of her golden hair? [...] Not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun; [...] 610 [...] Not--thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun [...] Such follying before thee--yet she had, [...] Indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad; [...] And they were simply gordian'd up and braided, [...] Leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded, [...] Her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow; [...] The which were blended in, I know not how, [...] With such a paradise of lips and eyes, [...] Blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs, [...] That, when I think thereon, my spirit clings [...] 620 [...] And plays about its fancy, till the stings [...] Of human neighbourhood envenom all. [...] Unto what awful power shall I call? [...] To what high fane?--Ah! see her hovering feet, [...] More bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet [...] Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose [...] From out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows [...] Her scarf into a fluttering pavilion; [...] 'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million [...] Of little eyes, as though thou wert to shed, [...] 630 [...] Over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed, [...] Handfuls of daisies."--"Endymion, how strange! [...] Dream within dream!"--"She took an airy range, [...] And then, towards me, like a very maid, [...] Came blushing, waning, willing, and afraid, [...] And press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much; [...] Methought I fainted at the charmed touch, [...] Yet held my recollection, even as one [...] Who dives three fathoms where the waters run [...] Gurgling in beds of coral: for anon, [...] 640 [...] I felt upmounted in that region [...] Where falling stars dart their artillery forth, [...] And eagles struggle with the buffeting north [...] That balances the heavy meteor-stone;-- [...] Felt too, I was not fearful, nor alone, [...] But lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky. [...] Soon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high, [...] And straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd; [...] Such as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd [...] Huge dens and caverns in a mountain's side: [...] 650 [...] There hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd [...] To faint once more by looking on my bliss-- [...] I was distracted; madly did I kiss [...] The wooing arms which held me, and did give [...] My eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live, [...] To take in draughts of life from the gold fount [...] Of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count [...] The moments, by some greedy help that seem'd [...] A second self, that each might be redeem'd [...] And plunder'd of its load of blessedness. [...] 660 [...] Ah, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press [...] Her very cheek against my crowned lip, [...] And, at that moment, felt my body dip [...] Into a warmer air: a moment more, [...] Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store [...] Of newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes [...] A scent of violets, and blossoming limes, [...] Loiter'd around us; then of honey cells, [...] Made delicate from all white-flower bells; [...] And once, above the edges of our nest, [...] 670 [...] An arch face peep'd,--an Oread as I guess'd.|$|R
