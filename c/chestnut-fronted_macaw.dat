The wings of these macaws are long and narrow which is typical for species of parrot which travel long {{distances}} in order to forage. They have a massive downward curved upper mandible and a patch of pale skin around the eye that extends to base of the beak. The skin patch bears minute feathers arranged in lines that form a pattern over the otherwise bare skin in all species of the genus except the scarlet macaw in which the skin is bare. In most species the bill is black, but the scarlet macaw and green-winged macaw have a predominantly horn coloured upper mandible and a black lower one.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>{{chestnut}}-fronted</b> {{or severe}} <b>macaw</b> is mostly green in colour with patches {{of red and}} blue on the wings. The head has a chestnut brown patch just above the beak. The beak is black and the patches around the eyes are white with lines of small black feathers. It {{is the only one}} of the miniature macaws that has lines of feathers in the bare patches around its eyes. In the wild their typically gregarious personality can become more aggressive at puberty giving them the name Severe. This tendency can be curbed in captivity but the species requires significant handling to make a tame pet. It is 45 - 50 cm long and weighs 300 - 410 g ...|$|R
