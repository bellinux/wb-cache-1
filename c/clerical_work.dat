5|$|In 1921, Kimball {{began work}} at the Thatcher branch of the Arizona Trust and Savings Bank, where he was {{eventually}} promoted to assistant cashier at $225 per month, a high salary at the time. The bank failed in 1923, {{in the aftermath of}} the Depression of 1920–21; Kimball lost his $3000 investments in bank stock and was forced to take a lower-paying job at another bank. Kimball also performed a variety of other local jobs to earn extra income to support his wife and children, including playing the piano and singing at local events, stringing with Camilla for local newspapers, distributing for an herbal laxative company, and <b>clerical</b> <b>work</b> for local stores.|$|E

The slow post-earthquake reconstruction, which has lasted for decades, is not currently completed. Nowadays Gesualdo holds its economy mostly on professional and <b>clerical</b> <b>works.</b>|$|R
5|$|Back at Berkeley from Johns Hopkins, Stratton {{stayed in}} the {{philosophy}} department as its second faculty member and first psychology specialist until the psychology department broke off in 1922. The new department started with four people: Stratton as chair; Edward Chace Tolman, with a Harvard degree, and an initiator of rodent experiments soiling the rooms of the philosophy department and hastening the split of the psychology division; Brown, Stratton's earlier student and Berkeley faculty member from 1908 onward; and Olga Bridgman, the first Berkeley psychology PhD awardee, albeit from the philosophy department. Before the split Stratton had set up Berkeley's first psychology lab in the philosophy department and taught psychology courses with Brown. The courses included sensation, perception, emotion, memory, and applications of psychology to professions such as law, medicine, schooling and <b>clerical</b> <b>work</b> by priests.|$|E

25|$|In 1721 Peter {{followed}} {{the advice of}} Theophan Prokopovich in designing the Holy Synod. It was a council of ten clergymen.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to describe the cost management practices in a company specialized {{in the manufacture of}} time control machines. Presently (in 1963) a standard direct costing system is employed by this company. Theoretically speaking the company's system is somewhat different from the so-called direct costing. Yet some difference is unescapable, since such ideal form as "a differential cost for a differential purpose" appears to be difficult to supply data on costs as rich as possible to serve for business management in view of the limited man-power for <b>clerical</b> <b>works.</b> Practically the most multi-purpose use of limitedly available cost informations is required. From such viewpoint, the standard direct costing system of the company seems very suggestive. So, in this paper we want to present the company's practices laying stress on the manufacturing profit report as the most significant information to be derived by the system, as well as the management methods for cost-down, in connection with the systems of accounting and production control...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] There are two {{organizing}} {{models that}} are effective among clerical workers. One {{model is the}} media-oriented, high-tech type of organizing. AFSCME does this very well; some other unions have also used it effectively. It starts with polling and opinion research on the work force that might be organized. This is followed up by targeted direct mail, telephone banks, radio and TV ads, campaign-specific newspapers and so on. This type of campaign is most appropriate for large public-sector units, especially when the <b>clericals</b> <b>work</b> in multiple locations. It is an important and successful means of organizing, but it has limited private-sector potential. The other successful model for organizing clerical workers is the grass-roots mass participation model, where the union staff representative builds the committee, and then the committee does the actual organizing. This approach was successful at Harvard University and at other high-visibility universities such as Columbia and Yale. It is also the approach {{that has been used}} in many less well publicized campaigns in the public and private sectors. This type of organizing is a very slow process because it is done one-on-one, worker-to-worker; but it builds strong commitment and involvement in the union...|$|R
25|$|Leonard Maurice Keysor {{was born}} Leonard Maurice Kyezor on 3 November 1885 in Maida Vale, London.

After completing his studies, Keysor travelled to Canada in 1904 where he remained {{for a period of}} ten years before emigrating to Australia in 1914 where his brother Stanley and sister Madge were living. He undertook <b>clerical</b> <b>work</b> in Sydney, New South Wales. He was the cousin of British actress and comedian, Rita Webb.|$|E
25|$|Another {{arena in}} which GLBT issues were being played out was in National service. Compulsory uniformed (usually military) service was {{implemented}} in 1967: all 18-year-old males were required to train full-time for two or two-and-a-half years, according to their level of education. Homosexuality and transsexuality were listed as conditions in a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) 'Directory of Diseases' (disease code 302). Prior to enlistment, all enlistees underwent a medical examination, during which {{they were asked to}} declare their homosexuality and/or transgender status (medics conducting the examination had little awareness of the difference between the two). New recruits who came out were deployed to non-combat, non-sensitive vocations. They were generally downgraded to a Public Employment Status of 3 (PES3) and assigned only light <b>clerical</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
500|$|Cardus {{spent his}} winters in Manchester, {{studying}} hard {{in anticipation of}} any opportunity for an opening as a music critic, eking out his summer savings by taking temporary <b>clerical</b> <b>work.</b> Around 1916 he met Edith King, an art teacher and amateur actress who became a regular attender at the Lyons café meetings. In the summers, when Cardus returned to Shrewsbury, she kept him informed of musical and cultural events in Manchester. The Shrewsbury years, which Brookes describes as a [...] "magical interlude", ended suddenly when, {{at the end of}} the 1916 summer, Alington was appointed headmaster of Eton. Initially it seemed likely that Cardus would join him there as his secretary, but Cardus's military exemption was under review; the uncertainty of his position ended the possibility of a post at Eton. He left Shrewsbury in September 1916 with little money, and no immediate prospects of regular work.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "major consequence" [...] of the typewriter's {{development}} was {{the entrance of}} women into the <b>clerical</b> <b>work</b> force. Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s, the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings. Before the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the first typing school in 1881, women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine. The expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded the efficiency of typewriters, however, also created demand for additional clerical workers. The low wages accepted by women—often 50% (or less) of those paid to a man—made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions. As typing and stenography positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories, women were attracted in large numbers to office work. In 1874, less than 4% of clerical workers in the United States were women; by 1900, the number had increased to approximately 75%. Before his death, Sholes remarked of the typewriter, [...] "I do feel that I have done something for {{the women who have}} always had to work so hard. This will enable them more easily to earn a living." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sociologists, economists, and {{politicians}} have proposed several {{theories about the}} causes of gender wage gap. Some believe that woman's salaries are based on the career path that women choose. They stipulate that the women chose low-paying jobs, <b>clerical</b> <b>work,</b> and to work in services (see also Pink-collar worker). [...] This is said to be relatively true at time because many women who select these careers find it easier to continue working these simple jobs rather that quit them if they choose to raise a family.|$|E
2500|$|Women held 25-30% of {{the jobs}} in the cities. Few women were {{employed}} in heavy industry, railways or construction.

50|$|When {{the pieces}} are sculptural ceramics, huacos are {{characterized}} by pictorial richness. There are many kinds of pots and containers covered with gaudy polychrome motifs, usually anthropomorphic representations of animals or mythological, erotica, etc. Two-toned Moche pottery is characterized by complex painted scenes detailing a narrative level. Examples of erotic huacos (Spanish: huacos eróticos), make the Moche's 800-year period (c. 200 BC to c. 600 AD) the longest unbroken erotic ceramics tradition in the world, unique {{in the history of}} mankind. In the 1570s during the Spanish conquest of Peru, Viceroy Francisco de Toledo and his <b>clerical</b> advisers <b>worked</b> to destroy many erotic huacos, though some extant artifacts have survived.|$|R
