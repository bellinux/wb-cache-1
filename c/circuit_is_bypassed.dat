40|$|Bariatric surgery {{has proved}} to be more {{effective}} than medical therapy in the treatment for obesity. Multiple techniques have been described and can be divided into three main groups: Restrictive surgery, where the main objective is to decrease the volume of caloric intake; malabsortive surgery, where a portion of the absortive <b>circuit</b> <b>is</b> <b>bypassed</b> and thus limiting the caloric absortion; and a combination of both. Among the restrictive techniques, gastroplasty {{was one of the first}} procedures described. First horizontal gastroplasty and then vertical banded gastroplasty showed good short-term results but with poor long-term outcomes. These techniques have been gradually abandoned. Adjustable gastric banding is a minimally invasive technique and has the advantage of being reversible. Weight loss is adequate, but less effective than gastric bypass. Postoperative complications are low at short-term, but increase per year at long-term follow-up. Sleeve gastrectomy is an effective weight loss procedure that can be performed safely as a first stage or primary procedure. This results in excellent weight loss and co-morbidity reduction that exceeds, or is comparable to, that of other accepted bariatric procedures. Gastric plicature is a relatively new procedure and has reported good short-term outcomes in weight loss with few short-term complications. However, long-term outcomes are yet to be demonstrated...|$|E

The low voltage section includes a transformer, rectifier, variable resistor and a bank of capacitors, while the starter circuit comprises several diodes and capacitors connected as a Cockcroft-Walton multiplier.

40|$|An {{animal that}} has {{previously}} encountered and reacted to antigen usually possesses an immune system poised to vigorously react to another {{challenge of the}} same antigen. It is often the case, however, that the immune cells of the primed animal are incapable of function when injected into an untreated, naive recipient. This barrier to adoptive immune transfer first appears in mice around 14 d of age (1). If the immune lymphocytes are injected by a subcutaneous route, a temporary immunity may ensue (2). Treatment of recipients with low doses of irradiation (3) or cyclophosphamide (Cy) (4 - 6) may allow successful transfer. In each case, it appears that effective adoptive transfer of immunity requires that the recipient's suppressor cell <b>circuits</b> <b>be</b> <b>bypassed</b> or curtailed. The ability of adoptively transferred immune cells to function in normal adult recipients, however, does not always require preparation of the host. For example, lymphoid cells from contact-sensitized animals {{have been shown to}} effectively transfer delayed-type hypersensitivity upon intravenous injection into normal adult animals (7). In this paper we report experiments designed to study immunoregulatory lymphocyte interactions that may account for the relative ease with which contact hypersensitivity can be adoptively transferred. The described interactions are related to previously reported immunoregulatory activities. These results are discussed in terms of our understanding of delayed-typed hypersensitivity and its regulation. Materials and Methods Mice.

5000|$|The media {{coverage}} {{during the investigation}} proved hostile to the railroad. One of the first newspaper reporters on the scene was a photographer for the Elko Daily Free Press, who took pictures of the railroad cars dangling {{over the side of}} the bridge, in the river and tipped over. The Southern Pacific accused the paper of publishing pictures taken at angles that made the damage appear worse than it was, to which the photographer responded, [...] "God knows, it would have been impossible to make it look worse than it was". The railroad was criticized for the amounts paid in compensation. In one case where a passenger originally bought a ticket on a coach fare train, but before boarding upgraded to the City of San Francisco, a premium fare train, the railroad only refunded the difference between the two tickets. Other papers promoted a theory that the sabotage story was a coverup to hide the railroad's negligence in allowing the engineer to operate the train at such high speed. These papers interviewed and noted that some passengers were uncomfortable with the speed of the train several minutes before it derailed; as the train rounded corners passengers had difficulty standing and some beer bottles were shaken off of tables. Despite these details, the official position of both the Southern Pacific and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) remains unchanged that the train was sabotaged, noting the evidence the rails were moved and the track <b>circuits</b> <b>were</b> <b>bypassed.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{power factor correction}} circuit has a fixed output voltage. However, in some applications, a PFC circuit with a wide output voltage range is needed. A single phase power factor correction circuit with wide output voltage range is developed in this work. After a comparison of two main power stage candidates (Buck+Boost and Sepic) in terms of efficiency, complexity, cost and device rating, the buck+boost converter is employed as the variable output PFC power stage. From the loss analysis, this topology has a high efficiency from light load to heavy load. The control system of the variable output PFC <b>circuit</b> <b>is</b> analyzed and designed. Charge average current sensing scheme has been adopted to sense the input current. The problem of high input harmonic currents at low output voltage is discussed. It is found that the current loop gain and cross over frequency will change greatly when the output voltage changes. To solve this problem, an automatic gain control scheme is proposed and a detailed <b>circuit</b> <b>is</b> designed and added to the current loop. A modified input current sensing scheme is presented to overcome the problem of an insufficient phase margin of the PFC circuit near the maximum output voltage. The charge average current sensing <b>circuit</b> will <b>be</b> <b>bypassed</b> automatically by a logical circuit when the output voltage {{is higher than the}} peak line voltage. Instead, a resistor is used to sense the input current at that condition. Therefore, the phase delay caused by the charge average current sensing <b>circuit</b> <b>is</b> avoided. The design and analysis are based on a novel air conditioner motor system application. Some detailed design issues are discussed. The experimental results show that the variable output PFC circuit has good performance in the wide output voltage [...] ...|$|R
40|$|An {{arteriovenous}} (AV) fistula is {{an abnormal}} high flow connection between an artery and vein which allows blood to flow directly from an artery into a vein, thus bypassing the capillary bed. Normally, oxygenated blood flows from arteries into the capillary bed, where oxygen is {{released into the}} tissues. Deoxygenated capillary blood then flows into veins {{and returns to the}} heart. When there is a direct connection between a high-pressure artery and low-pressure vein, a short <b>circuit</b> <b>is</b> created which <b>bypasses</b> the high resistance capillary bed. This results is in a high flow situation and pulsatile blood flow in the veins. This can cause the veins to bulge and enlarge and become varicose. If the AV communication is very large, tissues downstream may receive insufficien...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â€” Energy {{storage system}} plays an {{important}} role in electric vehicles. In these energy storage systems, a large number of battery cells are usually connected in series to enhance the output voltage for motor driving. The difference in electrochemical characters will cause state-of-charge (SOC) and terminal voltage imbalance between different cells. In the existing system, a hybrid cascaded multilevel converter which involves both battery energy management and motor drives. Each battery cell can be controlled to be connected into the <b>circuit</b> or to <b>be</b> <b>bypassed</b> by a half-bridge converter. All half bridges are cascaded to output a staircase shape dc voltage. Then, an H-bridge converter is used to change the direction of the dc bus voltages to make up ac voltages. The outputs of the converter are multilevel voltages with less harmonics and lower dv/dt, which is helpful to improve the performance of the motor drives. The imbalance of terminal voltage and SOC can also be avoided, Sso the life of the battery stack will be extended. In the proposed system, the level of the multi-level inverter can be increased to further reduce the total harmonic distortion without change in the circuit topology.

50|$|The <b>circuit</b> <b>was</b> also {{extensively}} {{used for}} testing, especially in Formula One. In 1986, Brabham Formula One driver Elio de Angelis {{was killed in}} a testing accident at the fast first turn after the rear wing of his Brabham BT55 had broken off. Although the <b>circuit</b> <b>was</b> not the cause of the crash, it was modified {{in order to make it}} safer. The length of the Mistral Straight was reduced from 1.8 km in length to just over 1 km, and the fast sweeping Verierre curves where de Angelis had crashed <b>were</b> <b>bypassed.</b> Effectively, after the start, instead of heading into the left hand Verierre sweeper, cars now braked hard and turned sharp right into a short run that connected the pit straight to the Mistral. This changed the circuit length for a Grand Prix from 5.81 km (3.61 mi) to just 3.812 km (2.369 mi). This also had the effect of cutting lap times from Keke Rosberg's 1985 pole time of 1:32.462 in his Williams-Honda turbo, to Nigel Mansell's 1990 pole time of 1:04.402 in his V12 Ferrari.|$|R
