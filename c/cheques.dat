5|$|Further {{denominations}} {{ranging from}} $5000 to $500 million were issued {{in the period}} between August 2006 and May 2008 as cent <b>cheques</b> quickly became outmoded. In {{the second quarter of}} 2008, special Agro <b>cheques</b> (Agricultural <b>Cheques)</b> were issued in denominations ranging from $5 billion to $100 billion as the currency exchange rate was floated. Since the functions were similar to Bearer <b>cheques,</b> it was in regular use as prices continue to rise. These <b>cheques</b> also carried time limits and limited security features. In the final months of the second dollar, the $200000 cheque was the lowest legal tender denomination by decree, despite having its expiry date extended twice. The $100000000 Bearer Cheque would have been the lowest legal tender denomination in circulation had the expiry dates of currency <b>cheques</b> been enforced without extension, with the $100 billion Agro Cheque being the highest whether or not the $200000 note was legal tender.|$|E
5|$|The RBZ also issued special traveller's <b>cheques</b> in 2003, {{with six}} {{denominations}} ranging from $1000 to $100000. These were short-lived due to unpopularity {{with the general}} public: identification was required both during issue and encashment of such <b>cheques,</b> which could only be used once by the bearer. As usual, banks levied a commission fee {{on all of the}} <b>cheques.</b>|$|E
5|$|Chopra once cited an {{interesting}} anecdote about {{his belief in}} Sarkar's film-making abilities. He said that he never personally signed the <b>cheques</b> for the film's expenditure. He transferred money into Sarkar's bank account and the <b>cheques</b> were eventually signed by Sarkar and his spouse.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cheque</b> {{number was}} added and <b>cheque</b> books were issued so that <b>cheque</b> numbers were sequential. This allowed for some basic fraud {{detection}} by banks {{and made sure}} one <b>cheque</b> was not presented twice.|$|R
50|$|Since the tax {{applied only}} to <b>cheque</b> accounts, bank {{customers}} could choose {{not to have a}} <b>cheque</b> facility to avoid the tax, or could keep a separate <b>cheque</b> account used only when needing to write a <b>cheque.</b>|$|R
50|$|A crossed <b>cheque</b> {{generally}} is a <b>cheque</b> that only bears two parallel transverse lines, optionally {{with the words}} 'and company' or '& Co.' (or any abbreviation of them) {{on the face of}} the cheque,between the lines, usually at the top left corner or at any place in the approximate half (in width) of the <b>cheque.</b> In the UK, the crossing is across the <b>cheque</b> by the person who originally wrote the <b>cheque</b> (the drawer), or it can legitimately be added by the person the <b>cheque</b> is payable to (the payee), or even by the bank that the <b>cheque</b> is being paid into.|$|R
5|$|The Reserve Bank issued Special Agro (Agricultural) <b>cheques</b> from 15 May to 31 July 2008. Although of a {{different}} design and with the intention for use only by farmers, it had {{found its way into}} regular use because of the parallel functions with bearer <b>Cheques</b> and the exponential rise of food prices. Following the 2008 currency reform, Agro and bearer <b>cheques</b> were phased out on 1 January 2009.|$|E
5|$|The 2006 {{bearer cheque}} series {{was put into}} {{circulation}} on 1 August 2006 and initially consisted of 14 denominations, ranging from 1¢ to $100000. The <b>cheques</b> were signed by Dr. Gideon Gono and were set to expire on 31 July 2007, except for the $100 and $500 <b>cheques,</b> which were initially due to expire on 31 December 2007, but later extended to 31 July 2008. The $5 denomination was also issued, despite not being widely publicised in the changeover campaign.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 {{bearer cheque}} series was first issued on 2 March 2007 with the {{introduction}} of $5000 and $50000 <b>cheques</b> to act as intermediary denominations between the $1000, $10000 and $100000 <b>cheques</b> respectively. As inflation intensified, the $200000 bearer cheque was also introduced on 1 August 2007, followed by the joint introduction of the $250000, $500000, and $750000 denominations on 20 December 2007. The $200000 bearer cheque had its date of lapse extended twice up to 31 December 2008.|$|E
5000|$|A {{certified}} check or certified <b>cheque</b> {{is a form}} of <b>cheque</b> for which the bank verifies that sufficient funds exist in the account to cover the <b>cheque,</b> and so certifies, at the time the <b>cheque</b> is written. Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the <b>cheque</b> is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, a certified <b>cheque</b> cannot be stopped (can't [...] "bounce"), and, in this manner, its liquidity is similar to cash, barring bank failure or illegal act (such as the funds being based on a fraudulent loan, at which point the <b>cheque</b> will be disavowed).|$|R

5|$|The Standard Chartered {{series was}} a series of {{emergency}} bearer <b>cheques</b> issued by the Standard Chartered Bank (hence the title on the top of these <b>cheques)</b> and the Cargill Cotton Group. They were authorised by the Reserve Bank as legitimate issues and were valid for six months from the date of issue, the first currency notes of the Zimbabwean dollar to have a time limit. They carry the signature of the company's finance director Priscilla Mutenbwa and operations director Stephen Newton-Howes.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Cheque</b> {{writers are}} advised to specify {{the amount of the}} <b>cheque</b> before signing it. A blank <b>cheque</b> can be {{extremely}} dangerous for its owner, because whomever obtains the <b>cheque</b> could write in any amount of money, and would be able to cash it (to the extent that the checking account contains sufficient funds, and depending on the laws in the specific country). Under American law, a blank <b>cheque</b> is an example of an [...] as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code's Article 3, Section 115 (a). Writing an amount in a blank <b>cheque,</b> without the authority of the signer, is an alteration. It is legally equivalent to changing the numbers on a completed (non-blank) <b>cheque.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>cheque</b> {{or check}} (American English; see {{spelling}} differences) is {{a document that}} orders a bank to pay a specific amount of money from a person's account to the person in whose name the <b>cheque</b> has been issued. The person writing the <b>cheque,</b> the drawer, has a transaction banking account (often called a current, <b>cheque,</b> <b>chequing</b> or checking account) where their money is held. The drawer writes the various details including the monetary amount, date, and a payee on the <b>cheque,</b> and signs it, ordering their bank, known as the drawee, to pay that person or company {{the amount of money}} stated.|$|R
5|$|On 1 August 2008 the {{banknotes}} of {{the third}} dollar (ZWR), which were printed for the abandoned {{second phase of the}} 2006 redenomination, replaced the <b>cheques</b> of the second dollar at the ratio of 10 billion (1010) to 1. The Bearer and Agro <b>cheques</b> of the second dollar were phased out along with the smaller denominations {{of the third}} dollar on 1 January 2009. Despite the reform the Reserve Bank issued several high-value denominations up to $100 trillion ($1014) in the period between September 2008 to January 2009, which merely kept in similar pace with the cash rate instead of the black market rates.|$|E
5|$|Julia {{found out}} that she was {{pregnant}} in January 1940. John Winston Lennon was born on 9 October 1940, on the second-floor ward of the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital in Liverpool, supposedly during a German air raid in World War II, although it has been confirmed there was no air raid on this date. Alf first saw his son that November when he returned from working as a merchant seaman on troop transports during World War II. He sent regular pay <b>cheques</b> to Julia, who lived with her son at 9 Newcastle Road (the Stanley family's home). He occasionally went back to Liverpool, but did not stay long before he was sent off on another ship. The <b>cheques</b> to Julia stopped when he went absent without leave in 1943. Neither Julia nor the Merchant Navy knew of his whereabouts. Julia only found out because she stopped receiving her allowance money, and the Navy wrote to her to inform her that they were looking for him.|$|E
5|$|On {{his first}} day in office, Macdonald kept a key Liberal promise by {{bringing}} in old age pensions for elderly people in need. <b>Cheques</b> would be mailed out to 6,000 pensioners {{by the end of}} March 1934. It was a popular move even though monthly pension payments in Nova Scotia were substantially below the national average.|$|E
5000|$|In the USA, a <b>cheque</b> {{as a form}} {{of payment}} can legally be refused for any reason (or no reason). Simply put: A payment via <b>cheque</b> is not a [...] "payment" [...] until the <b>cheque</b> was cashed and clears the banks.Example: You cannot order a fast food meal, throw a <b>cheque</b> on the counter and just leave with the meal, if they do not accept your payment via <b>cheque,</b> you would be {{committing}} larceny by taking the meal.|$|R
5000|$|In Scotland, a <b>cheque</b> {{acts as an}} {{assignment}} {{of the amount of}} money to the payee. As such, if a <b>cheque</b> is dishonoured in Scotland, what funds are present in the bank account are [...] "attached" [...] and frozen, until either sufficient funds are credited to the account to pay the <b>cheque,</b> the drawer recovers the <b>cheque</b> and hands it into the bank, or the drawer obtains a letter from the payee stating that they have no further interest in the <b>cheque.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A booster <b>cheque</b> is a {{fraudulent}} or bad <b>cheque</b> {{used to make}} {{a payment}} to a credit card account in order to [...] "bust out" [...] or raise the amount of available credit on otherwise-legitimate credit cards. The amount of the <b>cheque</b> is credited to the card account by the bank as soon as the payment is made, even though the <b>cheque</b> has not yet cleared. Before the bad <b>cheque</b> is discovered, the perpetrator goes on a spending spree or obtains cash advances until the newly-"raised" [...] available limit on the card is reached. The original <b>cheque</b> then bounces, but by then it is already too late.|$|R

5|$|The Zimbabwean dollar {{was first}} redenominated on 1 August 2006 under a {{currency}} reform campaign codenamed Operation Sunrise and involving the motto Zero to Hero. New-style bearer <b>cheques</b> {{of the second}} dollar (ISO 4217:ZWN) was introduced and replaced those of the first dollar (ZWD) at the ratio of 1000 to 1.|$|E
5|$|The {{change over}} process was given {{at short notice}} and was also rapid because all issues prior to the August 2006 series were to be demonetised and {{rendered}} worthless on 21 August 2006. Poor communications meant that many civilians of Zimbabwe were unable to convert old bearer <b>cheques</b> to new ones before the deadline.|$|E

5|$|A {{negotiable}} instrument {{is a type}} of contract that allows the transfer of money, such as a <b>cheque.</b> With a <b>cheque</b> there are three parties - the person holding the bank account who gives the <b>cheque</b> (the drawer), the party the <b>cheque</b> is made out to (the payee) and the drawer's bank which promises to pay the money to the payee (the drawee).|$|R
50|$|Adding a {{crossing}} to a <b>cheque</b> increases its security {{in that it}} cannot be cashed at a bank counter but must be paid into an account {{in exactly the same}} name as that which appears on the ‘payee’ line of the <b>cheque</b> (i.e. the person who has received the <b>cheque,</b> who is legally the “payee” and “holder” of the <b>cheque).</b>|$|R
5|$|Two {{variations}} {{that were}} issued for the $10000 and $100000 denominations are {{recognised in the}} Standard Catalog of World Paper Money: the difference between them {{was the use of}} digit grouping. <b>Cheques</b> with the denomination expressed as '10000' or '100000' bear serial numbers with the (scarce) prefix AA, while notes with prefixes AB onwards is expressed as '10000' or '100000'.|$|E
5|$|As the reconstituted Central Bank of Somalia fully assumes its {{monetary}} policy responsibilities, {{some of the}} existing money transfer companies are expected {{in the near future}} to seek licenses so as to develop into full-fledged commercial banks. This will serve to broaden the scope of the national payments system to include formal <b>cheques,</b> which in turn is expected to reinforce the effectiveness of the use of {{monetary policy}} in domestic macroeconomic management.|$|E

50|$|Under the {{clearing}} {{rules of the}} Canadian Payments Association, a post-dated <b>cheque</b> cannot be cashed prior to the date written on it.

5000|$|When a {{certified}} <b>cheque</b> is drawn, the bank operating the account verifies {{there are currently}} sufficient funds in the drawer's account to honour the <b>cheque.</b> Those funds are then set aside in the bank's internal account until the <b>cheque</b> is cashed or returned by the payee. Thus, {{a certified}} <b>cheque</b> cannot [...] "bounce", and its liquidity is similar to cash, absent failure of the bank. The bank indicates this fact by making a notation {{on the face of}} the <b>cheque</b> (technically called an acceptance).|$|R
