50|$|A <b>coupling</b> <b>nut,</b> {{also known}} as {{extension}} nut, is a threaded fastener for joining two male threads, most commonly a threaded rod, but also pipes. The outside of the fastener is usually a hex so a wrench can hold it. Variations include reducing coupling nuts, for joining two different size threads; sight hole coupling nuts, which have a sight hole for observing the amount of engagement; and coupling nuts with left-handed threads. These are used to make up long rod assemblies from shorter lengths of rods. The rods are threaded into the <b>coupling</b> <b>nut</b> for a certain distance. <b>Coupling</b> <b>nut</b> dimensions are described by the Industrial Fasteners Institute in standard IFI-128. It is given a plain finish. It is either cold drawn or hot rolled depending on the bar stock used. Coupling nuts threaded with two different thread sizes and profiles are called reducing coupling nuts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coupling}} system is usually made of two bayonet ramps machined on the external {{side of the}} receptacle connector and 2 stainless steel studs mounted inside the plug connector’s <b>coupling</b> <b>nut.</b> Several classes of electrical cable connectors, including audio, video, and data cables use bayonet connectors. Examples include BNC, C, and ST connectors. (The BNC connector is not exactly as described in this article, as the male, not female, connector has the slots and spring.) ...|$|E
50|$|Electrical blind mate {{connectors}} provide {{power or}} signal and are distinguished from other connectors {{in that they}} do not feature a rigid mechanical retention mechanism belonging to the interface itself, such as a threaded <b>coupling</b> <b>nut</b> on an SMA connector. They are typically used in a multi-pin arrangement between racks and panels, daughtercard to backplane, or similar applications where the connector is not mated by itself, but rather by the action of inserting the entire unit or module.|$|E

50|$|Threaded Coupling {{interconnect}} mating designs use a {{threaded nut}} on the plug, and a corresponding set of threads on the receptacle,to mate {{the pair of}} components. The <b>coupling</b> <b>nut</b> is usually equipped with flats or knurling for easy assembly. Different thread types, profiles andgeometries provide different functionality. Buttress Threads, for example, are often specified on plastic connectors due to their enhanced tensile strength.The MIL-C-38999 connector incorporates a triple-start threaded coupling mechanism for greater vibration protection and faster mating and unmating.|$|E
50|$|The BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) {{connector}} is {{a miniature}} quick connect/disconnect radio frequency connector used for coaxial cable. It features two bayonet lugs on the female connector; mating is fully achieved with a quarter {{turn of the}} <b>coupling</b> <b>nut.</b> BNC connectors are used with miniature-to-subminiature coaxial cable in radio, television, and other radio-frequency electronic equipment, test instruments, and video signals. The BNC was commonly used for early computer networks, including ARCnet, the IBM PC Network, and the 10BASE2 variant of Ethernet. BNC connectors are made to match the characteristic impedance of cable at either 50 ohms or 75 ohms. They are usually applied for frequencies below 4 GHz and voltages below 500 volts.|$|E

50|$|The term {{is usually}} a misnomer, {{introduced}} mostly by Fender whose guitars traditionally had what is called bolt-on necks. Real bolted joints (i.e., using bolt <b>coupled</b> with a <b>nut)</b> exist—particularly in acoustic guitars—but are less common in electric guitars. However, at least one aftermarket manufacturer offers a replacement for Fender neckplates and screws that uses captive inserts—embedded in the guitar body {{by means of an}} external self-tapping thread — and M4 machine screws. The maker claims this permits a higher fastening torque than ordinary wood screws, and hence a better coupling between neck and body.|$|R

[...] "Instantly, Sir What's-his-name recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the window, and turned to join the lady, victorious, but with a bump on his brow, found the door locked, tore up the curtains, made a rope ladder, got halfway down when the ladder broke, and he went headfirst into the moat, sixty feet below. Could swim like a duck, paddled round the castle till {{he came to a}} little door guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads together till they cracked like a <b>couple</b> of <b>nuts,</b> then, by a trifling exertion of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, Miss March.

Fitting comprises parts made of materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent leakage gaps from forming as temperature decreases. Consists of <b>coupling</b> <b>nut,</b> two flared tube ends, and flared O-ring spacer. Spacer contracts more than tube ends do as temperature decreases. This greater contraction seals tube ends more tightly, preventing leakage...|$|E
5000|$|Whether {{a rubber}} bushing can be {{replaced}} or repaired depends upon the propeller; some cannot. Some can, but need special equipment to insert the oversized bushing for an interference fit. Others {{can be replaced}} easily. The [...] "special equipment" [...] usually consists of a funnel, a press and rubber lubricant (soap). If {{one does not have}} access to a lathe, an improvised funnel can be made from steel tube and car body filler; as the filler is only subject to compressive forces it is able to do a good job. Often, the bushing can be drawn into place with nothing more complex than a <b>couple</b> of <b>nuts,</b> washers and a threaded rod. A more serious problem with this type of propeller is a [...] "frozen-on" [...] spline bushing, which makes propeller removal impossible. In such cases the propeller must be heated in order to deliberately destroy the rubber insert. Once the propeller is removed, the splined tube can be cut away with a grinder and a new spline bushing is then required. To prevent a recurrence of the problem, the splines can be coated with anti-seize anti-corrosion compound.|$|R
50|$|A grooved fitting, {{also known}} as a grooved coupling, has four elements: grooved pipe, gasket, <b>coupling</b> housing, and <b>nuts</b> and bolts. The groove is made by {{cold-forming}} (or machining) a groove {{at the end of a}} pipe. A gasket encompassed by coupling housing is wrapped around the two pipe ends, with the coupling engaging the groove; the bolts and nuts are tightened with a socket or impact wrench. The installed coupling housing encases the gasket and engages the grooves around the pipe to create a leakproof seal in a self-restrained pipe joint. There are two types of grooved coupling; a flexible coupling allows a limited amount of angular movement, and a rigid coupling does not allow movement and may be used where joint immobility is required (similar to a flange or welded joint).|$|R
60|$|Who can be {{familiar}} with any rustic highway in summer-time, without storing up knowledge of the many tramps who go from one oasis of town or village to another, to sell a stock in trade, apparently not worth a shilling when sold? Shrimps are a favourite commodity {{for this kind of}} speculation, and so are cakes of a soft and spongy character, <b>coupled</b> with Spanish <b>nuts</b> and brandy balls. The stock is carried on the head in a basket, and, between the head and the basket, are the trestles on which the stock is displayed at trading times. Fleet of foot, but a careworn class of tramp this, mostly; with a certain stiffness of neck, occasioned by much anxious balancing of baskets; and also with a long, Chinese sort of eye, which an overweighted forehead would seem to have squeezed into that form.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted at PT. XYZ which is a manufacturing company engaged {{in the manufacture of}} spare parts of screwpress and digester. The study was conducted only in the manufacture of spare parts of screwpress, namely protection nut, screw worm, cone guide, dismentling plate, cone, pin & <b>coupling</b> <b>nut,</b> strainer, extension shaft, intermediate gear, and flexible coupling. The flow pattern at PT. XYZ is job shop and produced by make to order, each product has a different process flow, sequence and timing of different processes, but through the facilities of the same engine, so may result in idle time on a machine and the accumulation of another job on the machine. PT. XYZ used production scheduling by FCFS rule that still result in a delay in the completion of orders and there was so much undone job because makespan values was too large. The {{purpose of this study was}} to minimize the makespan, namely the Tabu Search Algorithm. Results from this study is the reduction occurred from time to schedule company with Tabu Search Algorithm is from 141. 22 hours or minutes become 132. 14 8473. 2 7928. 4 hours or minutes. Relative Error shows that the savings obtained makespan between Tabu Search Algorithm with the method of company is 6. 8715 % and the value of Efficiency Index is 1. 068715. It can be concluded that the Tabu Search Algorithm produces a smaller makespan than the company actual scheduling...|$|E
