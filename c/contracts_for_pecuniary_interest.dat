Moreover, since smuggling, which the Isle of Man Purchase Act had only checked - not suppressed - had by that time almost disappeared, and since the Manx revenue had started to produce a large and increasing surplus, the authorities looked more favourably on the Isle of Man, and, thanks to this fact and to the representations of the Manx people to British ministers in 1837, 1844 and 1853, it obtained a somewhat less stringent customs tariff and an occasional [...] towards erecting its much neglected public works.|$|R

25|$|Bias {{arising out}} of a non-pecuniary {{interest}} can, like a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest,</b> result in the automatic disqualification of a judge from hearing a case. In R. v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2) (1999), the issue was whether Lord Hoffmann {{should be regarded as}} automatically disqualified from hearing an appeal by Augusto Pinochet against his extradition to Spain to stand trial for crimes against humanity. Lord Hoffmann was the Director and Chairperson of Amnesty International Charity Ltd., a company undertaking the aspects of the work of Amnesty International Ltd. which are charitable under UK law. He had no <b>pecuniary</b> <b>interest</b> in the company as he was neither employed nor paid by it, but had carried out fund-raising for it. Amnesty International Ltd. was a party to the case against Pinochet.
