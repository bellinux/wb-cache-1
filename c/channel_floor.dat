40|$|We {{report the}} {{implementation}} of an on-chip microscope system, termed fluorescence optofluidic microscope (FOFM), which is capable of fluorescence microscopy imaging of samples in fluid media. The FOFM employs an array of Fresnel zone plates (FZP) to generate an array of focused light spots within a microfluidic channel. As a sample flows through the channel and across the array of focused light spots, the fluorescence emissions are collected by a filter-coated CMOS sensor, which serves as the <b>channel’s</b> <b>floor.</b> The collected data can then be processed to render fluorescence microscopy images at a resolution determined by the focused light spot size (experimentally measured as 0. 65 mm FWHM).

40|$|High-resolution multibeam {{bathymetry}} enabled {{to identify}} coaxial trains of crescent-shaped bedforms within {{the heads of}} channelized features lying in shallow-water sectors along the tectonically-controlled Calabrian Margin. These bedforms have wavelengths of tens or few hundreds of meters and wave heights of some meters, and their crest-lines trend perpendicular to the maximum slope gradients. Repeated multibeam surveys realized in 2007, 2008, 2012 and 2013 showed a rapid and significant morphological evolution of the <b>channel’s</b> <b>floors,</b> with the generation or upslope migration of the bedforms. Based on their size, upslope migration and similarities with crescent-shaped bedforms recognized in other active canyon's heads, these features {{can be interpreted as}} cyclic steps. The bedforms are, in fact, formed or modified by frequent slope failures and related sedimentary flows, whose occurrence is favored by the concurrent presence of several predisposing and triggering mechanisms, such as high sedimentary rate due to steep coastal creek, severe storms and seismic events...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{topography}} {{data on the}} NAMOC {{originate from}} wide-range sonar scans. With a total length of about 3800 km, NAMOC {{is one of the}} longest underwater channels in the world. It is 100-200 m deep and 2-5 km wide at the <b>channel</b> <b>floor.</b> The rising levees of the NAMOC (about 100 m above the sea bed) often hinder confluence of some tributaries, which instead run along NAMOC for hundreds of km. Its western (right-hand, max. height 250 m) levee rises some 100 m above the eastern one (max. height 150 m). This asymmetry is attributed to the Coriolis effect affecting the turbidity currents, which reach velocities of 6-8.5 m/s and deposit silt and clay over the channel. The levee is absent {{in some parts of the}} NAMOC, for example between 56°N and 57°N, due to the local side-flows of sand.|$|E

40|$|Facies {{models that}} {{summarize}} the deposits of fluvial systems are well established for humid climate settings and for desert environments, but the deposits of rivers in the sub-humid and semiarid seasonal tropics {{have been largely}} ignored. Our observations and data from modern streams and recent deposits in northeastern Australia show how such rivers, with extremely variable discharge, have distinctive deposit characteristics that are substantially different from conventional fluvial facies models. These properties include (1) erosionally based channel-fill lithosomes that exhibit complex lateral facies changes, with (2) abundant, pedogenically modified mud partings, (3) complex internal architecture that may lack the macroform elements typical of other fluvial sediment bodies, (4) an abundance of sedimentary structures formed under high flow stage, and (5) an abundance of in situ trees that colonize <b>channel</b> <b>floors</b> and are adapted to inundation by fast-flowing water. We illustrate examples of this fluvial style from the rock record, and set out a new facies model. The recognition of such a distinctive fluvial character, and of changes in character through vertical successions, will aid paleoclimate and reservoir analysis...|$|R

50|$|Submerged Flow - {{when the}} water surface {{downstream}} of the flume is high enough to restrict flow through a flume, the flume is deemed to be submerged. Lacking the extended throat and discharge sections of the Parshall flume, the Montana flume has little resistance {{to the effects of}} submergence and as such it should be avoided. Where submerged flow is or may become present, there are several methods of correcting the situation: the flume may be raised above the <b>channel</b> <b>floor,</b> the downstream channel may be modified, or a different flume type may be used (typically a Parshall flume). Although commonly thought of as occurring at higher flow rates, It should be noted that submerged flow can exist at any flow level as it is a function of downstream conditions. In natural stream applications, submerged flow is frequently the result of vegetative growth on the downstream channel banks, sedimentation, or subsidence of the flume.|$|E
5000|$|A 2007 study [...] {{concluded}} the English Channel {{was formed by}} erosion caused by two major floods. The first was about 425,000 years ago, when an ice-dammed lake in the southern North Sea overflowed and broke the Weald-Artois chalk range in a catastrophic erosion and flood event. Afterwards, the Thames and Scheldt flowed through the gap into the English Channel, but the Meuse and Rhine still flowed northwards. In a second flood about 225,000 years ago the Meuse and Rhine were ice-dammed into a lake that broke catastrophically through a high weak barrier (perhaps chalk, or an end-moraine left by the ice sheet). Both floods cut massive flood channels in the dry bed of the English Channel, somewhat like the Channeled Scablands or the Wabash river in the USA.A further update in 2017, attributed a series of previously described underwater holes in the <b>Channel</b> <b>floor</b> -"100m deep" [...] and in places [...] "several kilometres in diameter" [...] to lake water plunging over a rock ridge causing isolated depressions or plunge pools.|$|E
5000|$|Walsh {{delivered}} his final plans for section 2 in September 1906. It was relatively {{similar to the}} ad hoc plans presented earlier, based on the 143 x 33 ft lock size used across the Trent system. To address the lack of water, Walsh added large piers leading upstream from the locks, forming small lakes {{at the entrance to}} each one. These were built from [...] tamarack poles driven into the riverbanks and covered with planks. Upstream from the lock in each of the pier areas was a 10 x 6 ft box in the <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> used to capture silt. Three earthen dams would redirect water from local creeks into the system, and the entire system would be lined with puddle, a clay mixture widely used to line channels and canals to prevent water leakage. The canal would be spanned by four bridges; two existing wooden bridges in Holland Landing would be raised, and two swing bridges would be built, one at the 2nd Concession and one at Green Lane.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{response of}} downstream moving European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) to velocity gradients created by orifice weirs {{placed in a}} flume were studied. The aim was to identify interspecific variation and test two hypotheses: (1) a more abrupt velocity gradient would induce a higher avoidance response and over a greater distance, and (2) fish would acclimate to the velocity gradient by incrementally sampling conditions closer to the orifice until successful passage occurred. European eel moved along the <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> and walls, responding after physical contact with the weir. Brown trout moved downstream head first and switched orientation at the velocity gradient without contacting the structure. Brown trout spent longer than European eel immediately upstream of a <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> orifice, although time to pass was similar; but less time at a mid-column orifice despite taking longer to pass. The mid-column orifice delayed both species longer. European eel passed orifices head first on initial encounter with no rejections, whereas brown trout passed tail first. Positions where brown trout first switched orientation and closest point to the orifice reached during initial approach occurred closer to a <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> than mid-column treatment. Brown trout {{did not appear to}} acclimate to the velocity gradient by sampling successively closer to the orifice.

40|$|The salient {{features}} {{of the interaction between}} a free-surface flow and a cylinder of rectangular cross-section are investigated and discussed. Laboratory-scale experiments are performed in a water channel under various flow conditions and elevations of the cylinder above the <b>channel</b> <b>floor.</b> The flow field is characterized on the basis of time averaged and fluctuating local velocity measurements. Dynamic loadings on the cylinder are measured by two water-insulated dynamometers placed inside the cylinder structure. Starting from frequency and spectral analyses of the force signals, insights on the relationship between force dominant frequencies and the Strouhal number of the vortex shedding phenomenon are provided. Experimental results highlight the strong influence of the asymmetric configuration imposed by the two different boundary conditions (free surface and <b>channel</b> <b>floor)</b> on (i) the mean force coefficients and (ii) the vortex shedding frequencies.

40|$|Mendocino Channel, a deep-water sinuous channel {{located along}} {{the base of}} Gorda Escarpment, was {{for the first time}} {{completely}} mapped with a multibeam echosounder. This study uses newly acquired multibeam bathymetry and backscatter, together with supporting multichannel seismic and sediment core data to quantitatively describe the morphometry of the entire Mendocino Channel and to explore the age and possible causes that {{may have contributed to the}} formation and maintenance of the channel. The first 42 km of the channel is a linear reach followed for the next 83. 8 km by a sinuous reach. The sinuous reach has a sinuosity index of 1. 66 before it changes back to a linear reach for the next 22. 2 km. A second sinuous reach is 40. 2 km long and the two reaches are separated by a crevasse splay and a large landslide that deflected the channel northwest towards Gorda Basin. Both sinuous reaches have oxbow bends, cut-off meanders, interior and exterior terraces and extensive levee systems. The lower sinuous reach becomes more linear for the next 22. 2 km before the channel relief falls below the resolution of the data. Levees suddenly decrease in height above the <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> mid-way along the lower linear reach close to where the channel makes a 90 ° turn to the southwest. The entire <b>channel</b> <b>floor</b> is smooth at the resolution of the data and only two large mounds and one large sediment pile were found on the <b>channel</b> <b>floor.</b> The bathymetry and acoustic backscatter, together with previously collected seismic data and box and piston cores provide details to suggest Mendocino Channel may be no older than early Quaternary.

40|$|Flexible {{barriers}} {{can be used}} within channelized riverbeds as {{an effective}} and efficient alternative to protect from debris flows. Their retention capability strongly depends {{on the size of}} the mesh openings and the gap between the lower barrier edge and the <b>channel's</b> <b>floor.</b> The question is now whether there is a relation between the grain size distribution of the debris material and the openings of a flexible barrier. Small-scale laboratory tests were performed to study these loading aspects of flexible debris-flow barriers for the Milibach river (Canton Berne, Switzerland). In situ debris material has been used to quantify the influence of different mesh sizes and the gap between the lower barrier edge and the riverbed compared to the d 90 grain size and the flow height, where d 90 is the maximum diameter of 90 % of the grains. It was possible to study the filling process and the retaining behaviour of the barriers as a function of the mesh size. A reasonable retention was reached with the net having a mesh size and a basal gap smaller than or equal to d 90. These relations could be transferred to the field. A dimensional analysis reveals possible dimensionless numbers that can be used to scale the laboratory results. The findings are supported by the results of similar laboratory tests using debris material from different locations and by the available field measurements...|$|R
