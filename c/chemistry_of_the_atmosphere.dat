5000|$|... 1990-1999: In 1990 the NSF's {{appropriation}} passed $2 {{billion for}} the first time. NSF funded the development of several curricula based on the NCTM standards, devised by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. These standards were widely adopted by school districts during the subsequent decade. However, in what newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal called the [...] "math wars", organizations such as Mathematically Correct complained that some elementary texts based on the standards, including Mathland, have almost entirely abandoned any instruction of traditional arithmetic in favor of cutting, coloring, pasting, and writing. During that debate, NSF was both lauded and criticized for favoring the standards. In 1991 the NSFNET acceptable use policy was altered to allow commercial traffic. By 1995, with private, commercial market thriving, NSF decommissioned the NSFNET, allowing for public use of the Internet. In 1993 students and staff at the NSF-supported National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, developed Mosaic, the first freely available browser to allow World Wide Web pages that include both graphics and text. Within 18 months, NCSA Mosaic becomes the Web browser of choice {{for more than a}} million users, and sets off an exponential {{growth in the number of}} Web users. In 1994 NSF, together with DARPA and NASA, launched the Digital Library Initiative. One of the first six grants went to Stanford University, where two graduate students, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, began to develop a search engine that used the links between Web pages as a ranking method, which they later commercialized under the name Google. In 1996 NSF-funded research established beyond doubt that the <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> above Antarctica was grossly abnormal and that levels of key chlorine compounds are greatly elevated. During two months of intense work, NSF researchers learned most of what is known about the ozone hole. In 1998 two independent teams of NSF-supported astronomers discovered that the expansion of the universe was actually speeding up, as if some previously unknown force, now known as dark energy, is driving the galaxies apart at an ever-increasing rate. Since passage of the Small Business Technology Transfer Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-564, Title II), NSF has been required to reserve 0.3% of its extramural research budget for Small Business Technology Transfer awards, and 2.8% of its R&D budget for small business innovation research.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemistry}} and mineralogy of soils reflects the <b>chemistry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> below which they develop. Today {{the presence of}} a cover of land plants can obscure the signature of a highly oxidizing atmosphere. Prior to the advent of higher land plants ca. 400 m. y. ago the obscuring effect of a biological interface should have been minor. It can be shown that under such conditions the behavior of ferrous iron during weathering depends on the relationship between the ratio of the net concentration of oxidants to the concentration of acids in rainwater, and on the ratio of the oxygen demand to the acid demand for complete weathering of the parent rock. An analysis of the behavior of iron in some 15 paleosols between 1. 0 and 2. 9 b. y. in age showed some time ago that iron was retained, or largely retained, in paleosols developed on rocks with a low ratio of oxidant demand to acid demand (R value) and was lost from paleosols with a high R value. The results indicate that between 1. 1 and 2. 9 b. y. b. p. the ratio of the net concentration of oxidants to CO 2 in rainwater was less than ca. 1 / 600 of the present-day value.
