40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2000 Cyanide is used {{extensively}} in the mining industry to leach gold and silver from their ores. Cyanide, {{in the form of}} sodium or potassium cyanide, is added in excess to that required theoretically due to equilibrium and kinetic considerations in the leaching step. This results in free <b>cyanide</b> <b>and</b> various other <b>cyanide</b> complexes reporting to the effluent streams of these operations In this study the removal of these species from solution by means of ion exchange resins was investigated Equilibrium conditions, kinetic parameters and the competitive exchange nature of the process was evaluated.

The experimental data obtained was found to be well explained by the Freundlich-type multiand single-component isotherms.

25|$|Instead of distilling, {{the sample}} is {{injected}} into an acidic stream where the HCN formed is passed under a hydrophobic gas diffusion membrane that selectively allows only HCN to pass through. The HCN that passes through the membrane is absorbed into a basic carrier solution that transports the CN to an amperometric detector that accurately measures cyanide concentration with high sensitivity. Sample pretreatment determined by acid reagents, ligands, or preliminary UV irradiation allow cyanide speciation of free <b>cyanide,</b> available <b>cyanide,</b> <b>and</b> total <b>cyanide</b> respectively. The relative simplicity of these flow injection analysis methods limit the interference experienced by the high heat of distillation and also prove to be cost effective since time consuming distillations are not required.|$|R

40|$|The {{sources and}} {{speciation}} of reduced carbon and nitrogen inferred {{for the early}} Archean are reviewed in terms of current observations and models, and known chemical reactions. Within this framework hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> <b>and</b> <b>cyanide</b> ion in significant concentration would have been eliminated by reaction with excess formaldehyde to form cyanohydrin (glycolonitrile), and with ferrous ion to formferrocyanide. Natural reactions of these molecules would under such conditions deserve special consideration in modeling of primordial organochemical processes. As a step in this direction, transformation reactions have been investigated involving glycolonitrile {{in the presence of}} water. We find that glycolonitrile, formed from formaldehyde <b>and</b> hydrogen <b>cyanide</b> or cyanide ion, spontaneously cyclodimerizes to 4 -amino- 2 -hydroxymethyloxazole. The crystalline dimer is the major product at low temperatue (approximately 0 C); the yield diminishes with increasing temperature at the expense of polymerization and hydrolysis products. Hydrolysis of glycolamide and of oxazole yields a number of simpler organic molecules, including ammonia and glycolamide. The spontaneous polymerization of glycolonitrile and its dimer gives rise to soluble, cationic oligomers of as yet unknown structure, and, unless arrested, to a viscous liquid, insoluble in water. A loss of cyanide by reaction with formaldehyde, inferred for the early terrestrial hydrosphere and cryosphere would present a dilemma for hypotheses invoking <b>cyanide</b> <b>and</b> related compounds as concentrated reactants capable of forming biomolecular precursor species. Attempts to escape from its horns may take advantage of the efficient concentration <b>and</b> separation of <b>cyanide</b> as solid ferriferrocyanide, <b>and</b> most directly of reactions of glycolonitrile and its derivatives...|$|R

The amount of the cyanide in the biomass of the fungus grown in presence of the waste was very scarce and comparable to that in absence of the pollutant.

Adsorption of Au(CN) 2 − and Ag(CN) 2 − on carbon degassed at 950 °C under 10 − 5 torr (1. 33 × 10 − 3 P) vacuum is decreased by 50 pct compared with the adsorption on normal activated carbon.
