In the delaminated zone the sublaminates are modelled by two beam <b>crosses</b> <b>stacked</b> one over another and coupled at the delamination front. The legs of the beam crosses are extended to the undamaged area in order to approximate the stiffness behaviour of the remaining structure. The lengths of the extended beams and an enlargement factor for their tensile stiffnesses are the free parameters of the model, which may be adapted later on to 3 D-analysis. The beams are stretched at the grip-ends according to the deformations of the undamaged structure. For the deformed laminate the energy release rates (ERRs) are evaluated at the delamination front in length and cross direction.

40|$|ABSTRACT Carton Clamp Test Methodologies and the Effects on Load Containment and Retention Tyler Don Blumer A carton clamp is an {{alternative}} device for moving packages and material. Instead of using iron tines {{like that of a}} conventional forklift, a carton clamp uses two large aluminum platens to slightly compress and secure the load for handling. This is advantageous as it allows operators to move layers of a unitized load individually, and eliminates the need for a pallet when handling full unitized loads. When using a carton clamp attachment, it is often difficult for operators to accurately gauge the amount of force being applied to the load. The required clamping force changes depending on the size, shape, and weight of the load. This creates the potential for under-clamping (slippage) and over-clamping (compressive damage). Seeing a market need for a reliable means of testing, two organizations set out to develop a testing protocol. A rift formed between schools of thought regarding the correct testing procedure. ISTA provides a sterile, calculated, and stationary simulation of carton clamp handling in its ISTA 6 -SAMS test protocol. ASTM offers a more holistic, dynamic, observational approach in its mobile ASTM 6055 standard protocol. One school of thought is suggested to imply that a package should be developed to be handled by the carton clamp (ASTM). The other school of thought is that the carton clamp attachment should be properly adjusted to the package specimen (ISTA). Previous studies have been performed citing the ISTA standard and using a specialized carton clamping device vibration device that is calibrated for laboratory research. Arguably, this method, though repeatable in nature, does not accurately simulate carton clamp handling found in industry. Likewise, the equipment investment is cost prohibitive for those in industry wishing to duplicate such a study. ASTM uses a carton clamp truck as used in industry, but does not specify any specific parameters making repeatability between laboratories and practitioners ambiguous. This study examined whether or not a common ground can be reached; implementing a carton clamp lift truck as found in industry allowing for mobile (hazard course) testing. A modified version of ISTA 3 B will be paired off against ASTM 6055 for evaluating both column and <b>cross</b> <b>stack</b> pallet patterns with a variety of treatments. This study attempted to determine if carton clamps as found in industry are capable and repeatable enough to provide consistent data. Similarly, this study examined the test methodologies effect on load containment via stretch film force, load retention via unitized load slippage, and the effects of ride height and driver interaction. The study sought to understand if these effects are uniform across the unitized load, or if particular layers of the load more affected than others...|$|R

In order to verify good impregnation, {{we performed a}} vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI) test of a full {{cross section of the}} CS module (CSM), 40 conductors tall and 14 conductors wide [2]. It was discovered that after preparation of the full <b>cross</b> section <b>stack</b> until completion of the VPI, the stack shrunk in height by 20 - 25 mm. Our study of the literature and discussions with the leading experts in VPI did not reveal obvious reasons for this change of height, so we launched a study to address this issue. We assembled two 12 x 1 (tall by wide) arrays and several 7 x 1 arrays in order to study characteristics of the dry winding pack under compressive force and effects of different fabrication steps. Then we impregnated these arrays in different conditions under compressive force and studied change of height as a result of compression, impregnation, gelling and curing of the stack of insulated conductors. We showed that by controlling the application of the compressive force, before closing the mold and during impregnation, one can reduce the height uncertainty. Most of the height reduction takes place while the glass is dry under the dead weight and the applied compressive force. Reduction of height during injection of the resin and during gelling, curing and cooling of the coil is noticeable, reproducible and relatively small.
