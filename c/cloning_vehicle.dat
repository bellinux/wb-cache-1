Both Tn 4001 C and Tn 4001 T transposed in M. pulmonis, and Tn 4001 T transposed in M. arthritidis.

The conjugative plasmid was transmissible to Streptococcus faecalis as well as to Streptococcus agalactiae (group B). The two nonconjugative plasmids were readily mobilized by a number of sex factors into these same two backgrounds and, in addition, readily transformed Streptococcus sanguis Challis to tetracycline resistance.

After transformation by this plasmid, both Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium were shown to express fimbriae which reacted with Klebsiella fimbrial antiserum. The approximate location of the relevant genes on the chimeric plasmid was determined by insertion of the transposable element Tn 5.

40|$|The plasmid pNov 2, {{carrying}} a cloned chromosomal marker conferring resistance {{to at least}} 2. 5 micrograms of novobiocin per ml, was constructed with a new Haemophilus influenzae <b>cloning</b> <b>vehicle,</b> pDM 2. The novobiocin marker of pNov 2 was not normally expressed, but in Rec+ cells approximately one in 10 (4) cells in a culture of a transformant became novobiocin resistant, a frequency about four orders of magnitude higher than the spontaneous mutation frequency. Variants of such cells that had lost the plasmid were also novobiocin resistant. Since Rec- cultures bearing pNov 2 showed novobiocin resistance only at the normal mutation frequency, we concluded that the Rec+ novobiocin-resistant transformants arose because of a rare recombination between plasmid and chromosome in which the chromosome acquired the novobiocin marker from the plasmid. Evidence is presented that novobiocin sensitivity is dominant over this particular novobiocin resistance marker...|$|E

Previous genetic studies have suggested that the products of the genes encoding transcripts 1 and 2, which are encoded by the TL-DNA region of pTiA 6, are responsible for inducing the auxin-independent phenotype of crown gall tissues. Here we report the construction of a plasmid, pMTlacT 2, which directs the synthesis of the Mr 49, 800 polypeptide encoded by the transcript 2 gene. Cell-free extracts prepared from Escherichia coli harboring this plasmid converted indoleacetamide to indoleacetic acid, the natural auxin of plants; extracts prepared from plasmidless strains of E. coli or strains harboring the <b>cloning</b> <b>vehicle</b> pBR 322 did not carry out this reaction.

The vehicles also contain a broad-host-range replicon and could be introduced into bacteria either by transformation or by transduction, using bacteriophage P 2. Insertion of foreign DNA into a unique restriction endonuclease cleavage site promotes the synthesis of either the Escherichia coli lactose operon or the kanamycin phosphotransferase gene from transposon Tn 5. Expression of the lactose operon could be detected by observing the color of Rhizobium colonies on medium that contained a chromogenic indicator. We also determined the growth conditions that {{make it possible to}} select either for or against the expression of the E. coli lactose operon in R. meliloti. Recombinant plasmids were constructed by inserting MboI restriction fragments of R. meliloti DNA into one of the vehicles, pMK 353.

The type I dihydrofolate reductase, encoded by plasmid R 483 and residing within transposon 7 (Tn 7), had a subunit molecular weight of 18, 000. The type II dihydrofolate reductase, specified by plasmid R 67, had a subunit molecular weight of 9, 000. These two enzymes were antigenically distinct in that anti-type II dihydrofolate reductase (R 67) antibody did not cross-react {{with the type}} I (R 483) protein. The trimethoprim-resistant reductase specified by plasmid R 388 had a subunit molecular weight of about 10, 500 and was immunologically related to the type II (R 67) enzyme.

Cloning experiments performed in plasmids carrying similar lacZ-phoC fusions confirmed their usefulness as cloning vectors for direct screening of recombinants. As compared to conventional lacZ alpha-complementation-based vectors, {{which can only be}} used in E. coli hosts carrying specific lacZ mutations, the lacZ-phoC fusion-based vectors can be used in combination with any E. coli host and require a less expensive histochemical assay for screening of recombinants, while retaining all the advantageous features that made the former so popular as general purpose <b>cloning</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R

The lambda plac 5 EcoRIDNA fragment containing the operator, promoter, and beta-galactosidase gene of the lactose operon {{was linked to}} the ColE 1 derivative plasmid pSF 2124, creating a plasmid designated pBGP 100, pBGP 100 contains one EcoRI site at the lac DNA/pSF 2124 DNA junction and another at the lambda DAN/pSF 2124 DNA junction. We deleted the latter EcoRI site to generate a plasmid (pBGP 120) retaining a single EcoRI site at the lac DNA/nSF 2124 DNA junction. To determine whether DNA introduced at the EcoRI site of pBGP 120 was expressed under lactose control, we inserted the EcoRI fragment containing 28 S ribosomal DNA of Xenopus laevis, creating the hybrid plasmid pBGP 123. RNA-DNA hybridization of pulse-labeled RNA from cells containing pBGP 123 showed that induction of the lac operon increases the percentage of labeled RNA complementary to Xenopus 28 S DNA about 9 -fold.

40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} analysis of in vitro transcriptional complexes of pBR 322 and pACYC 184 revealed {{five and six}} major transcriptional units, respectively, in these two plasmid vectors. These units are transcribed with various efficiencies, depending upon the individual promoter strengths, which differ in pBR 322 up to 10 -fold.

Whereas P 2 is known to promote tetracycline resistance and to be inactivated by HindIII cleavage, P 1 is able to transcribe DNA integrated at that site and probably contributes to the expression of the beta-lactamase gene in pBR 322. In pACYC 184, besides P 1, P 2, and the cat (chloramphenicol resistance) promoter (P 5), two initiation sites (P 3 and P 4) were mapped in a region that appears to be part of insertion sequence 1.
