Nineteen eighties, the {{sintering}} zone {{of cement}} rotary kiln and transition belt use main magnesia <b>chrome</b> <b>brick</b> {{because of its}} excellent performance, but the Cr 6 + is carcinogenicity, which causes great harm to the air, water pollution, animal or human. Therefore, new basic refractory material of free of chrome began to be developed. This test, the raw material {{is made up of}} fused magnesite particles (particle size 0 to 3 mm), fine fused magnesite powder with the size less than 200 meshes and fine fused magnesia-zirconiaâ€™s powder with the size less than 320 meshes, polyvinyl alcohol and calcium lignosulfonate liquor being used as the combiner. This paper discusses the effect of sinter temperature on sinter character of products...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} new {{refractories}} for copper converters is addressed in this thesis. Penetration resistance is viewed as the first property that must be evaluated for the selection of new refractories since {{it is known that}} melt penetration can promote or enhance the main wear mechanisms in copper converters: dissolution, erosion and spalling. Thus, a penetration test was designed where it is possible to control the oxygen potential and the "in-situ" formation of converter melts by injecting a mixture of inert gas and oxygen according to thermodynamic calculations. Initially, the effects of oxygen potential and matte grade on three different refractories (burned magnesite <b>chrome</b> <b>brick,</b> burned spinel bonded magnesite brick and spinel direct bonded) were studied using the operating conditions of copper converters. This allowed the selection of a potential candidate, the spinel direct bonded brick. Subsequently, the effect of time, temperature and melt composition on the penetration resistance of this candidate was studied and compared with the current refractory used in copper converter, namely burned magnesitechrome brick. The reactions occurring at the refractory pill-interface, the mechanisms and kinetics of penetration and the differences in performance were determined. In addition the mechanism of dissolution and penetration of magnetite coatings applied into basic refractories were elucidated since it is considered important when proposing new solutions and alternative refractories to avoid or reduce wear in copper converters...|$|E
40|$|In India, {{chromite}} is {{used for}} making magnesia <b>chrome</b> <b>bricks</b> due to its low modulus of elasticity. But the use of magnesia <b>chrome</b> <b>bricks</b> in the sintering zone of cement rotary kilns causes environmental pollution due {{to the formation of}} Cr+ 6 compounds. In order to meet the above challenges and to satisfy the operational demands due to use of alternative fuels, now-a-days, galaxite spinel is being used in place of chromite as a chrome free material. Galaxite is not available in nature and electro fusion is the main process by virtue of which it is industrially manufactured. However, the main drawback of electro-fusion process is both time and energy consumption. In such a backdrop, the present work has been carried out which describes the synthesis of galaxite by plasma fusion process and also the characterization of its refractory properties for application in cement rotary kilns. This alternative process is absolutely new, faster in approach and also economically viable. The developed magnesia galaxite brick shows higher performance rate and is also economically cost effective as compared to the conventional magnesia chrome and magnesia galaxite bricks, presently available in the market...|$|R
50|$|Heavy {{rain on the}} Etheridge {{watershed}} {{washed away}} the Tate and Lynd River railway bridges and the Chillagoe smelters had to close between 19 April and 3 May 1911. Copper smelting only operated for half the year. The copper furnace was remodelled in May 1911 with extra battery jackets replacing the brick shaft. The forehearths of cast iron were also replaced by riveted mild steel. The tanks were lined with <b>chrome</b> <b>bricks.</b> A 42 inch Dwight-Lloyd unit for the palate sintering process was completed by November 1911. However {{a large part of}} the smelter, including an electric crane, was destroyed by fire. The damage was quickly repaired and the smelter recommenced in February 1912.|$|R
50|$|As of 2011, {{nothing had}} taken place yet as for the conversion. In 2011, it was given a new green and gold paint scheme, {{replacing}} the mauve and teal colors added during a major update done in the mid-1980s that included new canopies at the entrances highlighted with <b>chrome,</b> glass <b>brick</b> and neon, and inside the mall were new indirect lighting replacing the large 1970s era light sculpture chandeliers, revised planters, benches and fountains in the revised design and color scheme.|$|R
25|$|MD 273 {{continues}} east through farmland to {{the community}} of Calvert, where the highway intersects MD 272, which heads south as North East Road and north as <b>Chrome</b> Road. <b>Brick</b> Meetinghouse Road partially parallels the present course to the south, providing access to the East Nottingham Friends Meetinghouse and the Elisha Kirk House. MD 273 crosses Little North East Creek, intersects Blue Ball Road in Blue Ball Village, and meets Little Elk Creek Road, which leads to Little Elk Farm and the historic home Hopewell. The state highway crosses Little Elk Creek just west of Rock United Presbyterian Church as the highway reaches Fair Hill, where Fair Hill Drive parallels MD 273 to the south before the intersection with MD 213, which heads south as Singerly Road and north as Lewisville Road. Beyond MD 213, MD 273 passes through Fair Hill Natural Resources Management Area, a state park most well known for the Fair Hill Training Center, an equestrian training facility. The state highway passes passes under three service bridges within the park and parallels an abandoned alignment as it crosses Big Elk Creek. MD 273 leaves the state park just west of Appleton Road in Appleton. The highway reaches its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line, where it continues east as DE 273 (Nottingham Road) into Newark.|$|R
