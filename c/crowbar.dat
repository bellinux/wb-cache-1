5|$|In late 1993, {{in order}} to make Todd look more menacing, he was given a scar to his right cheek by Marty's friend, Luna Moody, when she hit him in his face with a <b>crowbar</b> while {{preventing}} his attempt to rape Marty for a second time. The camera would often close in on and emphasize Todd's scar, which later became synonymous with the character.|$|E
5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a <b>crowbar.</b> Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E

In mining, <b>crowbars</b> are used to break and remove rock, but not as much in modern mining.|$|R

5|$|Former guitarist Scott Danough {{has said}} that he is {{influenced}} by metal and hardcore bands, like At The Gates, Slayer, Cradle of Filth, Integrity and Earth Crisis. Vocalist Brandan Schieppati has also mentioned American thrash metal bands as an influence on Bleeding Through, e.g. Testament or Exodus. In an interview, guitarist Brian Leppke added Cro-Mags, Entombed, <b>Crowbar</b> and Pantera as well to the list of influences. Lastly, keyboardist Marta Peterson is the one who brings industrial, symphonic black metal, and goth inspirations to the band's sound.|$|E
5|$|Michael Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), {{also known}} as Bishop II, is a {{scientist}} employed by Weyland-Yutani. Ripley meets him at the furnace, where he tells her that he designed the Bishop android series; his medical team will extract the Alien Queen inside her and destroy it. Ripley does not believe him, and backs away towards the furnace as he begs her {{to give him the}} creature. Aaron sneaks up behind him and strikes him with a <b>crowbar,</b> nearly ripping off his ear. He watches in despair as Ripley sacrifices herself by falling into the lead smelter.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 1983, {{the wooden}} {{rear of the}} cabinet was pried open with a <b>crowbar</b> and the cup was stolen again. Four men were tried and convicted in {{absentia}} for the crime. The trophy has never been recovered, and {{it is widely believed}} to have been melted down and sold. Only one piece of the Jules Rimet Trophy has been found, the original base which FIFA had kept in a basement of the federation's Zürich headquarters prior to 2015.|$|E

5|$|In Episode One players {{make their}} way through a linear series of levels and {{encounter}} various enemies and allies. The gameplay is broken up between combat-oriented challenges and physics-based puzzles. Episode One integrates tutorial-like tasks into the story to familiarize the player with new gameplay mechanics without breaking immersion. A head-up display appears on the screen to display the character's health, energy, and ammunition. Throughout the course of the game, the player accesses new weapons and ammunition that are used to defend the character from enemy forces. Unlike in Half-Life 2, where Gordon's initial weapon is the <b>crowbar,</b> Gordon first acquires the Gravity Gun, which plays {{a crucial role in the}} game by allowing the player to use physics to manipulate objects at a distance in both combat and puzzle-solving scenarios.|$|E
5|$|On the April 14, 2003, {{episode of}} World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)'s Raw, one of WWE's primary {{television}} programs, Matthews and York {{teamed up to}} defeat Phil Brown and Pat Cusick in a dark match. In the months that followed, Matthews wrestled for North America's three largest wrestling promotions, WWE, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), and ROH. His early months in WWE saw him taking on Lance Storm and <b>Crowbar</b> in dark matches, and Matt Hardy, Último Dragón and A-Train on Velocity. On July 19, 2003, at Death Before Dishonor, a Ring of Honor event, he teamed with Krazy K in a loss to Jeff Hardy in a handicap match. In August 2003, Matthews lost to Chris Sabin on an episode of TNA Xplosion.|$|E
5|$|Peggy tries {{in vain to}} {{extinguish}} the flames, but is forced out by her friends and family. Stacey, unaware of the events, heads upstairs to Lily and becomes trapped. She uses the <b>crowbar</b> to smash a boarded-up window and hands Lily over to Ryan, who has climbed a ladder. Peggy realises Phil is still inside {{and returns to the}} building with Billy. They find him trapped beneath a wooden beam, and are able to drag him out to safety. Ryan goes back up the ladder and carries an unconscious Stacey out. Stacey regains consciousness and sees that Lily is safe, and tells Ryan that Lily is his daughter. Peggy stares at the pub as it is completely destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Leonard Dillon (Charles S. Dutton) is the Fury 161 {{preacher and}} {{chaplain}} to the prisoners. An inmate {{with a history}} of murder and rape, he turned to God while incarcerated. Dillon {{is one of the few}} prisoners to whom Ripley speaks after her arrival; he asks if she has faith, and says that his men have faith enough to accept anyone. He delivers an eloquent eulogy during Newt and Hicks' funeral which touches Ripley. When prisoners try to rape her, Dillon bashes them with a <b>crowbar.</b> Ripley asks Dillon to kill her and the gestating Alien inside her, and he promises to do so when the Alien is dead. Shortly afterwards, Dillon organizes the remaining prisoners to lure the Alien into the foundry and drown it in molten lead. When the Alien attempts to follow Ripley out of the trap, Dillon baits it; when it attacks, Ripley submerges them both in the molten lead.|$|E
5|$|Most of the ranged {{weapons are}} based on real {{firearms}} {{with the exception of}} a Yithian directed-energy weapon introduced at the end of the game. The player character can also perform a melee attack with a <b>crowbar</b> or with a gun if all ammunition for it has been used up. The game features a realistic combat system: due to lack of HUD, the player has to count shots manually to know when the gun goes empty. There is also no artificial on-screen targeting reticle; instead, the player must aim through the iron sights on the weapons themselves, but sustained aiming tires the character and drops accuracy. The shooting system is unique in that fired rounds go exactly where the gun's barrel is pointing. For example, if the player character readies a reloaded weapon and the player pulls the trigger before the character animation has finished, the round will be discharged in the direction the gun was pointing when the shot was fired.|$|E
5|$|Peggy {{demands that}} Stacey leave the pub and Stacey pleads with {{her not to}} call the police for Lily's sake. She {{attempts}} to tell Ryan that he is Lily's father, but is interrupted by Pat, who thinks Stacey is trying to seduce him and slaps her. Phil smashes through the door using a <b>crowbar</b> that was left in the room. He starts taking cash and drinking alcohol, and interrupts Peggy before she can call the police about Stacey. They argue, with Phil accusing Peggy of loving the pub more than she loves him and throwing a match to the alcohol-soaked floor to start a fire. It spreads quickly, causing an explosion. The customers flee the pub, Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) is knocked to the ground and trampled in the process but is rescued by his father Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra) and brother Tamwar (Himesh Patel).|$|E

5|$|The marble was quarried from Mt. Pentelikon {{and transported}} 19km to the acropolis of Athens. A {{persistent}} {{question has been}} whether it was carved in situ. Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds {{it is easier to}} move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a <b>crowbar</b> to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is recoverable on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style, however, Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} between <b>Crowbar</b> and Terry Funk for the WCW Hardcore Championship. The match started when Funk ambushed <b>Crowbar</b> backstage. They fought inside a truck, and Funk sent <b>Crowbar</b> through {{a table with}} a hip toss. <b>Crowbar</b> {{attacked}} Funk with a car door, and slammed a door into Funk's head. Funk performed a low blow, and slammed the door into Crowbar's head repeatedly. Funk handcuffed <b>Crowbar,</b> and attacked him with the car door and a steel chair. <b>Crowbar</b> fought back with the chair, and performed a slingshot splash to Funk through a table. Funk fought back with chair shots, and pinned <b>Crowbar</b> after a piledriver on the car door to win the match and the title.|$|E
25|$|The ninth {{match was}} a <b>Crowbar</b> on a Pole match between Diamond Dallas Page and David Flair. Before the match, Flair {{attacked}} Page from behind {{with his own}} <b>crowbar,</b> and Page was knocked down outside the ring. Page returned, and the match started with Flair having the advantage. Flair performed several attacks, and applied the figure four leglock. Flair retrieved the <b>crowbar,</b> and attempted to use it. Page avoided it, and pinned Flair after a Diamond Cutter to win the match.|$|E

60|$|But {{we went to}} work. We {{decided to}} sink a shaft. So, for a week we climbed the mountain, laden with picks, drills, gads, <b>crowbars,</b> shovels, cans of {{blasting}} powder and coils of fuse and strove with might and main. At first the rock was broken and loose and we dug it up with picks and threw it out with shovels, and the hole progressed very well. But the rock became more compact, presently, and gads and <b>crowbars</b> came into play. But shortly nothing could make an impression but blasting powder.|$|R
25|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Meng, <b>Crowbar</b> and WCW Hardcore Champion Terry Funk in a Triple Threat {{match for the}} WCW Hardcore Championship. The match started out with <b>Crowbar</b> hitting Funk with a steel chair, and then {{dragging}} him backstage, where Meng joined {{the two men in}} the brawl using a variety of weapons. In the climax of the match, <b>Crowbar</b> applied a figure four leglock on Funk which was broken up by Meng who was then attacked by Funk and Meng with steel chairs. Meng then superkicked a chair into Meng's face followed by making Funk submit to the Tongan Death Grip to win the WCW Hardcore Championship.|$|E
