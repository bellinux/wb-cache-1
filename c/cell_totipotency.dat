Recently, several plant transcription factors that regulate meristem formation and dedifferentiation have been identified and include members of the TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 /CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR (TCP), WUSCHEL (WUS), and WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION (WIND 1) families. WUS and WIND positively control plant <b>cell</b> <b>totipotency,</b> while TCP negatively controls it.

We characterized and compared the transcriptome and proteome of rapeseed (Brassica napus) MDEs from the few-celled stage to the globular/heart stage using two MDE culture systems: conventional cultures in which MDEs initially develop as unorganized clusters that usually lack a suspensor, and a novel suspensor-bearing embryo culture {{system in which the}} embryo proper originates from the distal cell of a suspensor-like structure and undergoes the same ordered cell divisions as the zygotic embryo. Improved histodifferentiation of suspensor-bearing MDEs suggests a new role for the suspensor in driving embryo cell identity and patterning. An MDE culture cDNA array and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein sequencing were used to compile global and specific expression profiles for the two types of MDE cultures. Analysis of the identities of 220 candidate embryo markers, as well as the identities of 32 sequenced embryo up-regulated protein spots, indicate general roles for protein synthesis, glycolysis, and ascorbate metabolism in the establishment of MDE development. A collection of 135 robust markers for the transition to MDE development was identified, a number of which may be coregulated at the gene and protein expression level. Comparison of the expression profiles of preglobular-stage conventional MDEs and suspensor-bearing MDEs identified genes whose differential expression may reflect improved histodifferentiation of suspensor-bearing embryos.

Renewal of totipotent stem cells in the germline and cellular differentiation during early embryogenesis rely upon posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract Recent {{research}} has considerably changed our {{views about the}} developmental biology of early mammalian embryos compared with the ideas that were predominant throughout the previous 30 years or so. New data obtained recently suggest that the mammalian embryo uses traits of axes determination mechanisms that are not too different from the modes used by other vertebrates. In particular, it appears that asymmetry cues derived from the oocyte cytoplasm and modified/specified during sperm penetration appear to be crucial in normal embryogenesis, rather than the environmental influences exerted, e. g. at embryo implantation in the uterus. On the other hand, recent advances in research on the equivalents of a Spemann-Mangold organizer in species other than amphibia (including mammals) provide a background for new discussions of early embryonic patterning (axis formation) processes in the embryonic disc. In combination, these new views appear to be of considerable interest in {{the debate on the}} developmental properties and the ethical status of embryonic stem cells. The present review focuses specifically on the new aspects of axis determination and pattern formation processes in early mammalian embryos and relates this to questions about the developmental potential of embryonic stem <b>cells</b> (<b>totipotency</b> vs pluripotency/omnipotency), i. e. facts that appear to be worth considering in the recent debate about the ontological status of the early human embryo as well as of human embryonic stem cells...|$|R

Plant somatic cells {{have the ability to}} undergo sustained divisions and give rise to an entire organism. This remarkable feature is called plant <b>cell</b> <b>totipotency.</b> SE is a notable illustration of plant totipotency and involves reprogramming of development in somatic cells toward the embryogenic pathway.

It has been observed that there are genetic and also physiological factors that trigger in vitro embryogenesis in various types of plant somatic cells. Analysis of the proteome and transcriptome has led to the identification and characterization of certain genes involved in SE. Most of these genes, however, are upregulated only in the late developmental stages, suggesting that they do not play a direct role in the vegetative-to-embryogenic transition. However, the molecular bases of those triggering factors and the genetic and biochemical mechanisms leading to in vitro embryogenesis are still unknown.

40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} is {{an example}} of induced cellular totipotency, where embryos develop from vegetative cells rather than from gamete fusion.

The BABY BOOM (BBM) and LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC 1) and LEC 2 transcription factors are key regulators of plant <b>cell</b> <b>totipotency,</b> as ectopic overexpression of either transcription factor induces somatic embryo formation from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings without exogenous growth regulators or stress treatments.

In this study, we have analyzed the dynamics and possible role of histone H 3 K 9 methylation, a major repressive modification, as well as the effects on microspore embryogenesis initiation of BIX- 01294, an inhibitor of histone methylation, tested {{for the first time in}} plants, in Brassica napus and Hordeum vulgare. Results revealed that microspore reprogramming and initiation of embryogenesis involved a low level of H 3 K 9 methylation.

40|$|Background: During human {{preimplantation}} development, early blastomeres {{are believed}} to be totipotent. It is likely, however, that blastomeres are allocated to a specific lineage prior to any morphological differentiation. NANOG, SOX 2 and SALL 4 are transcription factors that {{play a key role in}} controlling stemness in embryonic stem cells (ESC) and are therefore candidate markers for developmental triggers in early embryos. KRT 18, a trophoblast-determining gene, may mark early differentiation. Examining the expression pattern of these genes may inform us about when and in which <b>cells</b> <b>totipotency</b> is lost during early human development. Methods: Thirtheen oocytes, 124 preimplantation embryos and 7 human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines were examined for the presence of NANOG, SOX 2, SALL 4 or KRT 18 proteins using immunostaining and confocal microscopy. Results: All stemness markers were expressed in the hESC, but none of them was specific for totipotent cells during human preimplantation development, and none of them seemed to mark cells allocated to the inner cell mass (ICM) or trophectoderm. After lineage specification, only the nuclear expression of NANOG and SOX 2 became restricted to the ICM, at least to some cells because only a subpopulation expressedNANOG. KRT 18 expression was seen for the first time during compaction in some outer cells. KRT 18 was not expressed in hESC. Conclusion: We conclude that the protein expression patterns of markers that define stemness in ESC do not identify the totipotent cells in human preimplantation embryos.

We found that many stages of the cell cycle were compatible with reprogramming as long as a sufficient supply of essential nuclear factors, such as Brg 1, were retained in the recipient cell following enucleation. Consistent with this conclusion, the increased efficiency of reprogramming when using donor nuclei from embryonic cells could be explained, at least in part, by reintroduction of embryonic nuclear factors along with the donor nucleus. By contrast, cell cycle synchrony between the donor nucleus and the recipient cell was not required at the time of transfer, as long as synchrony was reached by the first mitosis.

More detailed analyses revealed that AHL 15 is not specifically involved in the embryogenesis program, but that, surprisingly, the protein rather is involved in post embryonic development. Our analyses in Arabidopsis and tobacco showed that AHL 15 act as suppressors of developmental phase changes. In Arabidopsis, reduced AHL 15 expression coincided with a faster progression from the vegetative to the reproductive phase. By contrast, AHL 15 overexpression delayed the vegetative to reproductive phase change in both Arabidopsis and tobacco, causing some axillary meristems to be maintained in the vegetative phase, thereby allowing polycarpic development in these monocarpic annuals. By using RNA sequencing analysis, an extensive reprogramming of the transcriptome detected after AHL 15 activation. Rapid decondensation of heterochromatin was observed after AHL 15 activation, indicating that the global reprogramming of the transcriptome by AHL 15 might {{at least in part}} be caused by extensive modulation of the chromatin configuration. ...|$|E

Although Argonautes are broadly expressed, the Piwi subfamily primarily functions in the germ line. Piwi proteins are associated with germline-specific ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules in Drosophila, zebrafish, and mouse. Depending on the species and on the specific family member, Piwis play important roles in spermatogenesis and/or in maintaining germ cell and stem <b>cell</b> <b>totipotency.</b> Piwis bind to a newly discovered class of small RNAs, called piRNAs. C. elegans contains a large set of Argonaute/Piwi-related proteins, including two closely related to piwi called prg- 1 and prg- 2. The function of prg- 1 and prg- 2 and whether piRNAs exist in C. elegans is unknown. ResultsHere, we demonstrate that the Piwi-like protein PRG- 1 is localized to P granules in germ cells entering spermatogenesis and is required for successful spermatogenesis. Loss of prg- 1 causes a marked reduction in expression of a subset of mRNAs expressed during spermatogenesis, and prg- 1 mutant sperm exhibit extensive defects in activation and fertilization. Moreover, prg- 1 activity {{is required for the}} presence of the small RNAs called 21 U-RNAs.

Among the Argonaute family members, rde- 1 and alg- 1 / 2 have previously been shown to be essential for RNAi and development, respectively. In this work, we wanted to assign functions to the remaining members of this large family of proteins. Here, we describe the phenotype of 31 deletion alleles representing all of the previously uncharacterized Argonaute members. In addition to rde- 1, our analysis revealed that two other Argonaute members csr- 1 and prg- 1 are also essential for development. csr- 1 is partially required for RNAi, and essential for proper chromosome segregation. prg- 1, a member of PIWI subfamily of Argonaute genes, exhibits reduced brood size and temperature-sensitive sterile phenotype, implicating that it is required for germline maintenance. Additionally, we showed that RDE- 1 interacts with trigger-derived sense and antisense siRNAs (primary siRNAs) to initiate RNAi, while several other Argonaute proteins, SAGO- 1, SAGO- 2, and perhaps others, functioning redundantly, interact with amplified siRNAs (secondary siRNAs) to mediate downstream silencing. Moreover, our analysis uncovered that another member of Argonaute gene family, ergo- 1, is essential for the endogenous RNAi pathway. Furthermore, we built an eight-fold Argonaute mutant, MAGO 8, and analyzed its developmental phenotype and sensitivity to RNAi.

To characterize the molecular events of this unique process, transcriptome analysis, {{in combination with}} biochemical and histological approaches, were conducted in cotton, a typical plant species in SE. Genome-wide profiling of gene expression allowed the identification of novel molecular markers characteristic of this developmental process. Results RNA-Seq was used to identify 5, 076 differentially expressed genes during cotton SE. Expression profile and functional assignments of these genes indicated significant transcriptional complexity during this process, associated with morphological, histological changes and endogenous indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) alteration. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the genes were enriched for basic processes such as metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Unigenes were abundant for the functions of protein binding and hydrolase activity. Transcription factor–encoding genes {{were found to be}} differentially regulated during SE. The complex pathways of auxin abundance, transport and response with differentially regulated genes revealed that the auxin-related transcripts belonged to IAA biosynthesis, indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) metabolism, IAA conjugate metabolism, auxin transport, auxin-responsive protein/indoleacetic acid-induced protein (Aux/IAA), auxin response factor (ARF), small auxin-up RNA (SAUR), Aux/IAA degradation, and other auxin-related proteins, which allow an intricate system of auxin utilization to achieve multiple purposes in SE. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on selected genes with different expression patterns and functional assignments were made to demonstrate the utility of RNA-Seq for gene expression profiles during cotton SE.

40|$|International audienceEmbryonic stem (ES) {{cells are}} {{pluripotent}} cells {{derived from the}} inner cell mass of the mammalian blastocyst. Cellular differentiation entails loss of pluripotency and gain of lineage-specific characteristics. However, the molecular controls that govern the differentiation process remain poorly understood. We have characterized small RNA expression profiles in differentiating ES cells {{as a model for}} early mammalian development. High-throughput 454 pyro-sequencing was performed on 19 - 30 nt RNAs isolated from undifferentiated male and female ES cells, as well as day 2 and 5 differentiating derivatives. A discrete subset of microRNAs (miRNAs) largely dominated the small RNA repertoire, and the dynamics of their accumulation could be readily used to discriminate pluripotency from early differentiation events. Unsupervised partitioning around meloids (PAM) analysis revealed that differentiating ES cell miRNAs can be divided into three expression clusters with highly contrasted accumulation patterns. PAM analysis afforded an unprecedented level of definition in the temporal fluctuations of individual members of several miRNA genomic clusters. Notably, this unravelled highly complex post-transcriptional regulations of the key pluripotency miR- 290 locus, and helped identify miR- 293 as a clear outlier within this cluster. Accordingly, the miR- 293 seed sequence and its predicted cellular targets differed drastically from those of the other abundant cluster members, suggesting that previous conclusions drawn from whole miR- 290 over-expression need to be reconsidered. Our analysis in ES cells also uncovered a striking male-specific enrichment of the miR- 302 family, which share the same seed sequence with most miR- 290 family members. Accordingly, a miR- 302 representative was strongly enriched in embryonic germ cells derived from primordial germ cells of male but not female mouse embryos. Identifying the chromatin remodelling and E 2 F-dependent transcription repressors Ari 4 a and Arid 4 b as additional targets of miR- 302 and miR- 290 supports and possibly expands a model integrating possible overlapping functions of the two miRNA families in mouse <b>cell</b> <b>totipotency</b> during early development. This study demonstrates that small RNA sampling throughout early ES cell differentiation enables the definition of statistically significant expression patterns for most cellular miRNAs. We have further shown that the transience of some of these miRNA patterns provides highly discriminative markers of particular ES cell states during their differentiation, an approach that might be broadly applicable to the study of early mammalian development...|$|E
40|$|Embryonic stem (ES) cells do {{not exist}} in nature but, usually {{produced}} from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst, are considered equivalent to ICM cells captured during {{a short period of}} transient self-renewal and pluripotency capability. Although, artificial, ES cells represent a formidable model to investigate fundamental aspects of cell stemness and early embryo development. ES cells are indeed the only stem cell type able to indefinite self-renewal and to differentiate into cellular derivates of ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal lineages. Recent extensive studies have revealed that ES cells maintain self-renewal and pluripotency because of a self-organizing network of transcription factors and intracellular pathways activated by extracellular signalling that together prevent their differentiation and promote their proliferation, and because of epigenetic processes that maintain the chromatin in a plastic differentiation status. Primordial germ cells (PGCs), the embryonic precursors of gametes, because of their unique ability to retain true developmental totipotency, are considered the mother of all stem cells. Despite several similarities with ES cells, they display only transient self-renewal capability and distinct lineage-specific characteristics. In fact, in normal condition PGCs are believed to differentiate into germ cells only, oogonia/oocytes in the female, and prospermatogonia in the male which ultimately produce eggs and sperm, respectively. It is not until the fertilization of the egg or parthenogenesis that the intrinsic germ <b>cell</b> <b>totipotency</b> program is revealed. Many aspects of the extrinsic factors and signalling required for ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency have been identified and dissected. On the other hand, several extrinsic factors controlling PGC development have been identified, but the underlying molecular signalling remains little defined. In the present review, by comparing the available information about signalling elicited by four growth factors such as leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP 4), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF 2) and kit ligand (KL) in mouse ES cells and PGCs, on which most of such studies have been performed, we aimed to give clues for the molecular understanding of the similarities and differences between these two unique cell types and to explain how apparent contradictory properties such as lineage-specific characteristics and pluripotency may coexist within PGCs. The first two growth factors have been demonstrated to control key aspects of the self-renewal and pluripotency of ES cells. BMP 4 and KL are known for their crucial role in regulating various process of PGC development in the embryo from the formation of PGC precursors and PGC specification (BMP 4) to their survival, proliferation and migration (KL). Moreover, the combined action of LIF, FGF 2 and KL is necessary and sufficient for PGC transformation into ES-like cells termed embryonic germ (EG) cells...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is {{a general}} rule of nature that larger organisms are more com-plex, at least as {{measured}} by the number of distinct types of cells present. This reflects the fitness advantage conferred by a division of labor among spe-cialized <b>cells</b> over homogeneous <b>totipotency.</b> Yet, increasing size has both costs and benefits, and the search for understanding the driving forces behind the evolution of multicellularity is becoming a very active area of research. This article presents an overview of recent experimental and theoretical work aimed at understanding this biological problem from the perspective of physics. For a class of model organisms, the Volvocine green algae, an emerging hypothesis connects the transition from organisms with totipotent cells to those with ter-minal germ-soma differentiation to the competition between diffusion and fluid advection created by beating flagella. A number of challenging problems in fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamics, and control theory emerge when one probes the workings of the simplest multicellular organisms. ...|$|R
40|$|In most {{multicellular}} organisms, including mammals, {{germ cells}} {{are at the}} origin of new organisms and ensure {{the continuation of the}} genetic and epigenetic information across the generations. In the mammalian germ line, the primordial germ cells (PGCs) are the precursors of the primary oocytes and prospermatogonia of fetal ovaries and testes, respectively. In mammals such as the primates, in which the formation of the primary oocytes is largely asynchronous and occurs during a relatively long period, PGCs after the arrival into the XX gonadal ridges are termed oogonia which then become primary oocytes when entering into meiotic prophase I. In the fetal testes, germ cells derived from the PGCs after gonad colonization are termed prospermatogonia or gonocytes. One of the most fascinating aspect of the mammalian germline development is that it is probably the first cell lineage to be established in the embryo by epigenetic mechanisms and that these inductive events happen in extraembryonic tissues much earlier that gonad develop inside the embryo proper. Moreover, such events prepare the germ <b>cells</b> for <b>totipotency</b> through genetic and epigenetic regulations of their genome function. How this occurs remained a mystery until short time ago. In this chapter, I will report and discuss the most recent advances in the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the formation in extraembryonic tissues and migration of PGCs toward the gonadal ridges made primarily by studies carried out in the mouse with some perspective in the human. Established concepts about these processes will be only summarized when necessary since they are widely described and discussed in many excellent reviews; most of them are cited in the text below...|$|R
40|$|Formation of a eutherian mammal {{requires}} concurrent {{establishment of}} embryonic and extraembryonic lineages. The {{functions of the}} trophectoderm and primitive endoderm are to enable implantation in the maternal uterus, axis specification and delivery of nutrients. The pluripotent epiblast represents the founding cell population of the embryo proper, which is protected from ectopic and premature differentiation until it is required to respond to inductive cues to form the fetus. While positional information {{plays a major role}} in specifying the trophoblast lineage, segregation of primitive endoderm from epiblast depends upon gradual acquisition of transcriptional identity, directed but not initiated by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling. Following early cleavage divisions and formation of the blastocyst, cells of the inner <b>cell</b> mass lose <b>totipotency.</b> Developing epiblast <b>cells</b> transiently attain the state of naive pluripotency and competence to self-renew in vitro as embryonic stem cells and in vivo by means of diapause. This property is lost after implantation as the epiblast epithelializes and becomes primed in preparation for gastrulation and subsequent organogenesis. This is the final published version.

40|$|The {{germline}} is the totipotent and immortal lineage. In {{order to}} protect its developmental potential, the germline must prevent the expression of somatic factors that would lead germ cells to acquire a more differentiated fate. A shared feature of germ cells in different organisms {{is the presence of}} dense, non-membrane-bound organelles called germ granules. Germ granules in Caenorhabditis elegans, called P granules, are segregated to the germ lineage in embryos and at most stages of development are concentrated around the outer surface of nuclei. P granules are composed of RNA and RNA-binding proteins including the PGL and GLH proteins, and worms that lack these proteins are sterile, especially at high temperatures. Although much is known about the assembly, composition, and physical properties of P granules, their functions remain unknown. In this thesis, I used genetic analysis, immunostaining and microscopy, and transcript profiling to investigate the role of P granules in the C. elegans germline. To test the effects of eliminating P granules, worms were simultaneously depleted of the four most important P-granule proteins (PGL- 1, PGL- 3, GLH- 1, and GLH- 4). As expected from previous genetic analysis, this caused sterility. Unexpectedly, in a fraction of sterile worms, germ cells were observed to express markers of somatic fate. Transcript profiling of dissected P-granule-depleted gonads revealed up-regulation of many genes normally restricted to neuronal tissues and down-regulation of genes involved in germline processes. P granules {{do not appear to be}} necessary for larval germline development, and the transcriptomes of larval gonads with or without P granules are nearly identical. These findings support a model in which P granules maintain germ <b>cell</b> <b>totipotency</b> and immortality by preventing somatic development in the germline. This thesis also explored whether expression of a germ cell program, including P granules, in the somatic cells of worms extends their lifespan. This analysis was inspired by a previous study that claimed that long-lived daf- 2 mutants use an ectopic germline program in their somatic cells to extend their lifespan. Contrary to what was previously reported, I did not find evidence of an ectopic germ cell program in daf- 2 worms and showed that daf- 2 mutants do not rely on P granules or a master germline chromatin regulator for their lifespan extension. I also found that worms that are known to express germline proteins in their somatic cells are not long-lived. Taken together, my findings demonstrate a role for P granules in preventing somatic development in the C. elegans germline and argue against the hypothesis that acquisition of a germ cell program in somatic cells increases lifespan...|$|E
40|$|In higher plants, the zygote divides {{to produce}} the embryo, a bipolar {{structure}} with one, two or several embryonic leaves (cotyledons), the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and the root apical meristem (RAM). Throughout plant life, apical meristems continually produce new organs (branches, leaves or roots), which are continuously added to the plant body. An important consequence of this unlimited and reiterative growth, defined as “recurrent ontogenesis”, {{is the absence of}} separation between germ-line and soma; thus any somatic cell is a potential progenitor of a new individual. This capacity (totipotency) is revealed by processes of vegetative propagation in vivo, such as: i) adventitious embryos from nucellar cells; ii) adventitious embryos from single cells of epidermis of stems and leaves; iii) adventitious buds of multicellular origin. Moreover, somatic <b>cell</b> <b>totipotency</b> is most clearly expressed in the ability of plant cells to develop into a complete fertile plants by in vitro adventitious embryogenesis and/or organogenesis. The concept of totipotency implies that every plant cell, with a normal complement of chromosomes, is able to express its genetic potential by regenerating a whole plant. However, as differentiation proceeds, tissues, initially competent to develop {{in a number of different}} patterns, reduce their degree of freedom, becoming eventually determined with respect to a single fate. Differentiated plant cells can also acquire new cell fates in the adult body, often independently of neighbouring cells. Structures as embryos, shoots, leaves and flowers may occur upon a leaf or leaf homologue in any position (epiphylly). The principal aim of this work is the improvement of our information on plant <b>cell</b> <b>totipotency</b> at molecular, cytological and biochemical level through the study of a plant systems featured by epiphylly: the clone EMB- 2 of the interspecific hybrid Helianthus annuus x H. tuberosus characterized by the ectopic proliferation of adventitious morphogenetic structures on leaves. Notwithstanding the relative difficulty to identify the genes involved in the acquisition of <b>cell</b> <b>totipotency,</b> it is likely that a regulatory network, analogous to that involved in meristem and zygotic embryo development control the coordinate development of adventitious meristems and somatic embryos. Recent findings seem to support this point of view. In fact, the ectopic expression of genes involved in formation and maintenance of SAM (e. g. KNOTTED 1 -like homeobox, KNOX) or in embryo development (e. g. LEAFY COTYLEDON, LEC) is sufficient to re-programme in vivo the fate of differentiate cells. In the present work, the LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 -like gene of H. annuus (HaL 1 L) was isolated HaL 1 L expression patterns. HaL 1 L mRNA peaked at an early stage of embryogenesis (i. e. globular-, heart-, early cotyledon-embryo). More precisely, at the globular and heart stage HaL 1 L mRNA was prevalent in the outer cell layers of the embryo, in the suspensor and in integumentary tapetum cells. At cotyledon stage, HaL 1 L transcripts became evenly distributed throughout the embryo, but the positive signal was more evident in both inner cells of the integument and integumentary tapetum cells. In particular, a very strong signal was detected in the chalaza’s window. This result could support the hypothesis that HaL 1 L plays a role in the control of the nutrient transfer during embryo development. The class I KNOX gene of H. tuberosus, named HtKNOT 1, was also isolated. HtKNOT 1 was expressed in vegetative shoot apices and stem internodes of H. tuberosus, while leaves (blades and veins) and petioles did not accumulate any detectable HtKNOT 1 transcripts. In particular, a higher accumulation of HtKNOT 1 mRNA was detected in apical stem internodes in comparison to medial and basal region of the stem. HtKNOT 1 transcripts were strongly detected in the meristematic dome of the SAM, but a weak presence of transcripts was also detected in incipient leaf primordia. These findings indicate that, in some species, the transcriptional down-regulation of class I KNOX genes is not a prerequisite for lateral organ initiation. In apical stem internodes of H. tuberosus, HtKNOT 1 is expressed in cambial cells, phloem cells and xylematic parenchyma cells of the xylem. In basal internodes, HtKNOT 1 expression was restricted to the presumptive initials and recently derived phloem cells. The expression of HtKNOT 1 in the cambium is not surprising because the class I KNOX genes are involved in the meristem maintenance and the cambial cells behave as totipotent cells responsible for the stem radial growth. In this work we have also investigated the possible role of HtKNOT 1 in controlling the development of the heterogamous inflorescence in the Helianthus genus. Inflorescence meristems of H. annuus and H. tuberosus showed HtKNOT 1 expression in the region of the floret meristems and in developing organ primordia (i. e. floral bracts, petals, stamens and carpels). In older flowers strong expression of HtKNOT 1 was seen in developing ovule. Notably, in the anthers of H. annuus, HtKNOT 1 expression was also seen in pollen mother cells, in the tapetum and in the first and second mitotic division of developing pollen. This expression analysis also strongly suggests that the HtKNOT 1 function is employed in pollen morphogenesis: this fact, if confirmed, will be one not yet discovered role of the class I KNOX genes. Several data support the view that when class I KNOX and/or LEC genes are not properly repressed adventitious phenomena of epiphylly became possible in different species. The EMB- 2 somaclonal variant, derived by in vitro tissue culture of the tetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 68) interspecific hybrid Helianthus annuus x H. tuberosus (A- 2 clone), shows an unusual pattern of development: it produces both in vitro and in vivo, epiphyllous embryos and shoot-like structures. More precisely, in addition to nonepiphyllous leaves (NEP) that expanded normally, some leaves of EMB- 2 plants exhibit on the adaxial surface knobs and a prominent proliferation of ectopic structures (EP leaves), usually arranged in clusters along leaf veins. In EMB- 2 plants, HtKNOT 1 was highly expressed in both stem internodes and EP leaves. By contrast, HtKNOT 1 mRNA accumulation was undetected in roots, petioles and NEP leaves. HtKNOT 1 transcripts were confined at the level of the palisade cell layer in EP leaves. Thereafter, transcripts accumulated in developing morphogenetic structures, but the signal did not spread to epidermal cells. However, as development of shoot-like structures proceeded, transcript signal was also spread throughout epidermal cells. Afterwards, the level of Ht-KNOT 1 transcripts decreased and mainly accumulated in the external cell layers of ectopic shoot-like structures. In contrast, in adventitious embryos, HtKNOT 1 transcripts were confined to the basal portion of structures, whereas in the advanced globular embryos, the signal was restricted to a few scattered cellsHaL 1 L transcripts were undetected in both A- 2 and NEP leaves while it was expressed in EP leaves. More precisely, the accumulation of HaL 1 L transcripts was evenly detected throughout all stages of somatic embryos. On the contrary, no signal related to HaL 1 L transcript accumulation was observed in developing shoot-like structures. Histological analyses suggested that epidermal and parenchyma cells around the vascular bundles contributed to the development of epiphyllous structures. Thus, the ectopic accumulation of HaL 1 L mRNA in this cell type opens the possibility that HaL 1 L is also involved in switching somatic cell fate towards embryogenic competence. Given the clear link of both cytokinins and auxin with plant organogenesis and embryogenesis, the endogenous levels of these hormones were detected in epiphyllous (EP) and non-epiphyllous (NEP) leaves of EMB- 2 plants as well in the non-epiphyllous control genotype (A- 2). The endogenous levels of cytokinins and IAA in NEP leaves of EMB- 2 plants did not significantly differ in comparison to A- 2 leaves. By contrast, the content of both hormones in EP leaves were 1. 8 -fold higher than NEP ones. The results suggested that epiphylly of EMB- 2 plants was tightly related to a localized increase of hormones in EP leaves as compared to NEP ones. The involvement of cytokinins in ectopic morphogenetic events of EMB- 2 plants was strengthened by immunolocalization results. The presence of active zeatin marked the development of adventitious shoot-like structures, from the first division of epidermal cells to SAM establishment. In EP leaves, a strong immunostaining was detected wherever the ectopic structures were formed, as well as at the level of the vascular bundles. In addition, a strong immunoreaction marked adaxial epidermal cells, which in some case undergo periclinal division, as well as clusters of epidermal cells, from which morphogenetic structures were likely to originate. As morphogenetic structures developed, a strong immunostaining was clearly detected. By contrast, in epiphyllous embryolike structures, zeatin signals were confined to a few scattered cells. Notably, before ectopic structures became evident, HtKNOT 1 expression and zeatin signal were localized in distinct histological domains (mesophyll tissue vs. epidermis). However, as morphogenetic processes occurred, the accumulation of HtKNOT 1 transcripts and zeatin clearly overlapped. A- 2 leaves (i. e. non epiphyllous clone) displayed a strong accumulation of auxin in vascular bundles but not in the epidermis. Nevertheless, an immunostaining signal of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) was evident in the mesophyll cells, preferentially in the chloroplasts. By contrast, EP leaves showed an auxin accumulation in a single cell or in a small group of cells of the adaxial epidermis. Indeed, early stages of ectopic embryogenic structures showed a strong immunostaining at the level of the whole globular embryo-like structure. By contrast, as for the zeatin immunolocalization, in advanced stages of embryo development a characteristic scattered immunoreaction was observed. In EP leaves with shoot-like structures, the auxin is preferentially accumulated in the protoderm and in active dividing cells. Interestingly, in the early stages of somatic embryo development, HaL 1 L expression and auxin were localized in the same histological domains (i. e. epidermis, parenchyma cells of vascular bundles, globular embryos). In conclusion, the epiphylly of EMB- 2 plants seems linked to a complex regulatory network involving hormones and transcription factors. At physiological level the epiphylly of EMB- 2 can be related to a localized increase of both zeatin and IAA while about the molecular mechanisms involved, HtKNOT 1 and HaL 1 L cooperate during ectopic embryogenesis. On the contrary, in adventitious organogenesis only misexpression of HtKNOT 1 has probably specific function. The histological analyses, the localization of auxin and cytokinin in specific histological domains and the expression patterns of HaL 1 L and HtKNOT 1 also identified the epidermal cells located in proximity of vascular bundles as the totipotent cells of the EMB- 2 clone. The localized increase of IAA in epidermal layers of EP leaves could determines an alteration in the intracellular polarity an therefore a shift of cell division plane (anticlinal vs. periclinal). Thereafter, citokinins, activated by HtKNOT 1, could promote, by active divisions, the development of ectopic structures. Additionally, the two transcription factors could interact with other regulators of embryogenesis and/or organogenesis in the differentiation and organization of ectopic structure...|$|E
40|$|Sponges {{from the}} phylum Porifera, Latin porus, “pore”; ferous, “bearing”(Borror 1988) are {{essential}} yet often overlooked in coral-reef ecosystems. Marine sponges {{are among the}} oldest, structurally simplest multicellular sessile animals that {{bridge the gap between}} single celled organisms (protists) and more complex Metazoans (Kaplan 1988, Taylor et al 2007). Although they lack complex tissues and organs seen in higher Metazoa, they are nevertheless a highly successful group of animals due to their aquiferous filtering system, <b>cell</b> <b>totipotency,</b> and plasticity of their body (Brusca and Brusca 2003). As a prolific producers of bioactive metabolites, they have considerable ecological importance due to their abundance and ability to filter enormous volumes of seawater (Taylor et al 2007). In each section of this report, I will discuss a topic relating to all sponges, dive further into explination specifically for Clionid sponges, and lastly compare two case studies for the topic involving Clionids exclusively. The aim of this review is to examine recent developments in the understanding of a variety of sponge aspects and to help others understand basic sponge biology and lifestyles while further explaining why Clionid sponges specifically are of importance and how they impact the worlds oceans. A coral reef is a tropical shallow-water photosynthetic scleractinian coral community colonized and strongly affected by octocorals, algae, and other invertebrates such as sponges, that secrete calcium carbonate (Rutzler 2004). The entire reef system operates through different animal-plant symbioses which construct limestone through secretion and cementation (Rutzler 2004). The health of different coral reef communities have been attributed to how fast limestone is created versus eroded within certain vicinities, along with many other factors. Sponges participate in all aspects of these processes thus playing an especially important role (Neumann 1966, Diaz and Rutzler 2001, Rutzler 2004). Rutzler (2004) claims that modern sponges can no longer be solely included with coral reef framework builders because they clearly impact the coral reef stabilization as well as its destruction due to the major processes of bioerosion and lithification (Goreau et al. 1979). After Diaz and Rutzler (2001) studied sponge diversity, abundance, productivity and nutrient cycling from Carrie Bow Caye on the barrier reef in Belize, they explained that sponges have multiple properties that make them influential part of coral reef ecosystems. These characteristics include high diversity, high abundance, calcification capabilities, acting as primary producers of nitrification through symbioses, having different chemical and physical adaptations for space competition with the potential to change the chemistry of the water column. Sponges are of particular interest in the medical field and researchers have looked specifically at the sponge-bacteria relationship as a possible source of natural medicines after isolating antimicrobial compounds (Stierle and Stierle 1992, Imamura et al 1993, Jayatilake et al 1996, Bultel-Ponce et al 1997, Webster et al 2001 b). Also, many sponges produce and release antibiotics that play a role in their own defense by warding off hungry predators, being encroached on by aggressive neighbors, or overgrown by fouling organisms. (Ruppert and Fox 1988, Stierle and Stierle 1992, Imamura et al 1993, Jayatilake et al 1996, Bultel-Ponce et al 1997, Webster et al 2001 b). Recently, a collection of important bioactive compounds have been discovered as antibiotics in sponges, many having potential pharmacological significance (Brusca and Brusca 2003). Specifically, two different Clionid species; Cliona celata (Keyzers et al 2008), Cliona patera (Sawangong et al 2008). I will not discuss these in this report, but they are noted for completeness sake. The discovery of these natural products in sponges has led to a renewed interest in and a desire to understand sponges. Sponges of the family Clionidae have long been known for the ecological impact they cause by riddling limestone objects which they inhabit in most marine environments (Rutzler 1975). Clionid sponges {{are one of the most}} important framework bioeroders on coral reefs. They have the ability to out compete stressed corals, so any dramatic increases in the area or abundance of these sponges could lead to an increase in the breakdown of the reef framework and reduce the opportunity for reef recovery (Callahan et al 2005). They are extremely strong reef space competitors aggressively undermining and displacing live coral tissue (Rutzler 1975, 2002 a; Lopez Victoria et al 2003, Lopez-Victoria 2 ̆ 6 Zea 2005). Researchers also find boring sponges of importance when reconstructing paleoenviromental records by measuring the size of bore holes in reefs compared to the geological record (Edinger and Risk 1996, Zundelevich et al 2007) ...|$|E

We are using cattle clones as a model to assess the inter-individual epigenetic variability and its consequences on phenotypes, including agronomical relevant traits and developmental pathologies. Indeed, the developmental defects frequently associated with cloning {{could be related to}} the insufficient extent of reprogramming, leading to perturbations of the nuclear microenvironment of the early embryo with long term consequences. To identify epigenomic patterns affected by incomplete reprogramming, we used immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA followed by hybridization on a new bovine promoter microarray (MeDIP-chip). The microarray targets the upstream region (- 2000 to + 1360 bp) of 21416 genes (UMD 3. 1 assembly). We first focused on liver, because overgrowth of this organ is often observed in clones. The microarray has been hybridized with MeDIP samples from livers of normal Holstein animals (4 perinatal controls and 8 adults, obtained by artificial insemination and all healthy) and livers of Holstein clones (7 perinatal clones, either stillborn or suffering from severe pathologies, and 7 adult clones, with normal to pathological phenotypes). After normalization of the data, enriched probes were identified using ChIPmix (Martin-Magniette et al., 2008). Results of exploratory analysis, including correlation clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), will be presented. A statistical test based on differences in the spatial distribution of the enriched probes was used to identify Differentially Methylated Regions (DMR) related to age and cloning. In age-related DMR, we show that cloning erases the methylation signatures associated to age. Conversely, analysis of cloning-related DMR revealed that bovine clones behave like adults independently of their age...|$|R
