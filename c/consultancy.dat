40|$|In {{the past}} five years, {{political}} scientists in Australia have begun {{to pay more attention}} to the increased use of external consultants by public sector agencies. There has been particular interest in some high-profile ‘policy review’ <b>consultancies,</b> as well as the emergence of firms specialising in ‘policy advice’ or ‘management strategy’. This paper seeks to complement this emerging body of mainly qualitative research by undertaking quantitative analysis of the ‘type’ of <b>consultancies</b> undertaken. Three Commonwealth departments were examined for the five years from 1988 / 89 (the first year of mandatory reporting on consultants). 3, 500 <b>consultancies</b> were coded using eleven categories, with these categories grouped under the super-category of either ‘programme content’ or ‘corporate services’. ‘Programme content’ <b>consultancies</b> were those geared to research, review and advice on the substance or purpose of programmes, as distinct from their administrative infrastructure. The paper shows that <b>consultancies</b> oriented to program content were quite conspicuous, being roughly equal in total number and cost to those oriented to corporate services. The distinctiveness and significance of program content <b>consultancies</b> is evidenced by two further patterns. First, program content <b>consultancies</b> were undertaken by different consulting entities to those undertaking <b>consultancies</b> oriented to corporate services. Academics, for instance, were very prominent in the former but not so in the latter. Second, programme content <b>consultancies</b> were much more likely to be justified by the ‘need for independent review’ than were the corporate service <b>consultancies,</b> though the main official justification for both orientations was ‘need for specialist skills’. Overall, the paper argues that the matters referred to consultants were often significant for program development. This analysis of the early years of mandatory reporting is intended to serve as a benchmark for a follow-up study, so as to gauge whether program content <b>consultancies</b> have become even more prominent a decade later...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} five years, {{academics}} in Australia have begun {{to pay more attention}} to the increased use of external consultants by public sector agencies. This paper seeks to complement this emerging body of mainly qualitative research by undertaking quantitative analysis of the 'type' of <b>consultancies</b> undertaken. Three Commonwealth departments were examined for the 1988 - 93 period, the first years of mandatory reporting on consultants and a period of 'take-off' in their use by departments. Over 3500 <b>consultancies</b> were coded using eleven categories, with these categories grouped under the super-category of either 'programme content' (PC) or 'corporate services' (CS). The paper shows that <b>consultancies</b> oriented to PC were quite conspicuous, being roughly equal in total number and cost to those oriented to CS. The distinctiveness and significance of PC <b>consultancies</b> is evidenced by two further patterns. First, although a majority of both PC and CS <b>consultancies</b> were undertaken by private businesses or partnerships, about forty per cent of PC <b>consultancies</b> were undertaken by entities that did not rely on consulting as their primary source of income. Among these 'non-commercial' consultants, academics were especially prominent in PC <b>consultancies.</b> Second, PC <b>consultancies</b> were much more likely to be justified by the 'need for independent review' than were CS <b>consultancies.</b> Overall, the article argues that the matters referred to consultants were often significant for the development of programme or major projects within them. Whether it was desirable for around fifty per cent of these programme content <b>consultancies</b> to be given to commercial entities, ostensibly reliant on consulting or contracting as a major source of income, is a matter for debate...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an empirical study, investigating the uptake of ecodesign by industrial design <b>consultancies</b> (ID <b>consultancies)</b> in Australia, China, Germany and the USA. Designing products for a low environmental load, usually termed as ecodesign, offers high potential to reduce the environmental impact of our society, aiming for a sustainable development. However, there still appears to be no widespread uptake of ecodesign into product development praxis by industrial designers, with most ecodesign activity focusing on the engineering phase. Especially seldom are the necessary radical interventions to significantly improve the environmental performance of products. The literature review revealed that ID <b>consultancies</b> might {{be in a position to}} improve this situation. This paper {{presents the}} findings of a website content analysis, investigating the extent of ecodesign uptake by ID <b>consultancies</b> in Australia, China, Germany and the US. Those four countries were chosen to see if different, country specific frameworks impact on the attitude of ID <b>consultancies</b> towards ecodesign. The paper verifies that ID <b>consultancies</b> have a high potential to improve ecodesign uptake by using their influence especially on early phases of the product development process and by addressing also non engineering related issues for ecodesign. This potential does not appear to be fully embraced yet. The paper concludes by identifying the highest representation of ecodesign on websites of Australian ID <b>consultancies</b> and the lowest on websites of Chinese ID <b>consultancies.</b> The way ID <b>consultancies</b> practice ecodesign is very country specific. Understanding the differences and developing recommendations how ID <b>consultancies</b> can better unfold their ecodesign potential requires deeper investigations in the case specific factors...|$|R

40|$|Ecodesign offers {{significant}} {{potential to}} reduce {{the environmental impacts of}} products. Whilst some integration of environmental considerations into design occurs in progressive companies when engineering the product, this only represents a small share of the possible design interventions to improve the environmental performance of products. For example, developing new product concepts to fulfill needs in a less environmentally harmful way and considering user related aspects offers a large, currently under-realized potential. This paper identifies industrial design (ID) <b>consultancies</b> as potential agents to tackle this issue on a strategic and operational basis. The extent to which this potential is currently applied was assessed by conducting a content analysis of websites of ID <b>consultancies</b> in Australia, China, and Germany. How ID <b>consultancies</b> represent their ecodesign practice is country-specific. Despite the differences, some ID <b>consultancies</b> in all countries announce and/or show the capability to develop completely new concepts and to influence user related factors to improve environmental performance. This shows their potential to address current shortcomings in ecodesign practice. As ID <b>consultancies</b> embracing that potential still are a minority, further research should be directed to a deeper examination of barriers and stimuli for ID <b>consultancies</b> to take up ecodesign. ecodesign practice; industrial design; design <b>consultancies...</b>|$|R
