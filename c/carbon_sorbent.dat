30|$|Surface {{functionality}} of <b>carbon</b> <b>sorbents</b> {{is characterized}} by its responsibility for all activity and reactivity as well as capability for all adsorption properties and processes. In this work, infrared spectroscopy was used to obtain information about the chemical structure and functional groups of the raw material and the hybrid activated carbon biosorbents. The FTIR spectrum were recorded using a Shimadzu Fourier Transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR system-BX 0.8009) {{was used in the}} range 200 – 4000  cm− 1 to acquire the FT-IR spectra of all chemically and biologically treated active <b>carbon</b> <b>sorbents.</b> These sorbents were also imaged by the use of scanning electron microscope (JSM- 5300, JEOL Ltd.). An ion sputtering coating device (JEOL-JFC- 1100 E) was used to coat the SEM specimens with gold to increase the conductivity. The Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) technique is the most common method for determining the surface area of powders and porous materials. Nitrogen gas is generally employed as the probe molecule and is exposed to a solid under investigation at liquid nitrogen conditions (i.e. 77  K). The surface area of the solid is evaluated from the measured monolayer capacity and knowledge of the cross-sectional area of the molecule being used as a probe. For the case of nitrogen, the cross-sectional area is taken as 16.2 A 2 /molecule. Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS 90 was used to measure the particle size and the zeta potential of active <b>carbon</b> <b>sorbents</b> microspheres.|$|R

The hypothesis of this environmental engineering master thesis: modified, catalyst coated activated <b>carbon</b> <b>sorbent</b> {{combined with other}} advanced oxidation processes can effectively decompose organic pollutants in water and air. To test this hypothesis, titanium dioxide catalyst coated activated <b>carbon</b> <b>sorbent</b> was prepared by sol gel method, its features were investigated and the evaluation of efficiency of decomposition of chosen organic pollutants in different advanced oxidation systems was performed.
