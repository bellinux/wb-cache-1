40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. The author {{questioned}} why state attorneys, {{prosecutors and}} magistrates/judges in South Africa rarely review the compensation concerns of sexual violence <b>complainants</b> and witnesses in criminal sentencing matters, and in quasi-criminal civil forfeiture proceedings, as is frequently done for other classes of <b>complainants</b> (namely, commercial crime <b>complainants</b> and victims {{of violent crime}} in general). A conclusion was reached, after conducting extensive research for this thesis, that offender and state compensation processes were sparingly utilized in cases of sexual violence, in part, due to institutional biases that resulted in discrimination. The above finding was substantiated by way of twenty-seven (27) interviews with criminal justice role-players, eight (8) court file case studies and forty-seven (47) victim surveys. The above subject matter is important because failures by criminal justice state role-players to review the compensation concerns of sexual violence victims, on account of biases, causes real harm to these vulnerable <b>complainants.</b> For example, research in this thesis confirmed that state and offender compensation can assist sexual violence <b>complainants</b> with their cultural obligations, court appearances and post-assault health expenses and to pre-empt compensation reviews on account of biases disrupts victims' post assault recoveries. Further, compensation can assist sexual violence <b>complainants</b> with security related expenses, including relocation costs, {{so as to avoid}} repeated victimization...|$|R

25|$|Women are not {{necessarily}} sympathetic to female complainants who have been sexually harassed. If the harasser was male, internalized sexism (or jealousy over the sexual attention towards the victim) may encourage some women to react with as much hostility towards the <b>complainant</b> as some male colleagues. Fear of being targeted for harassment or retaliation themselves may also cause some women to respond with hostility. For example, when Lois Jenson filed her lawsuit against Eveleth Taconite Co., the women shunned her both at work and in the community—many of these women later joined her suit. Women may even project hostility onto the victim in order to bond with their male coworkers and build trust.|$|E
40|$|The list {{of motives}} by Kanin (1994) {{is the most}} cited list of motives to file a false {{allegation}} of rape. Kanin posited that <b>complainants</b> file a false allegation out of revenge, {{to produce an alibi}} or to get sympathy. A new list of motives is proposed in which gain is the predominant factor. In the proposed list, <b>complainants</b> file a false allegation out of material gain, emotional gain, or a disturbed mental state. The list can be subdivided into eight different categories: material gain, alibi, revenge, sympathy, attention, a disturbed mental state, relabeling, or regret. To test the validity of the list, a sample of 57 proven false allegations were studied at and provided by the National Unit of the Dutch National Police (NU). The complete files were studied to ensure correct classification by the NU and to identify the motives of the <b>complainants.</b> The results support the overall validity of the list. <b>Complainants</b> were primarily motivated by emotional gain. Most false allegations were used to cover up other behavior such as adultery or skipping school. Some <b>complainants,</b> however, reported more than one motive. A large proportion, 20 % of <b>complainants,</b> said {{that they did not know}} why they filed a false allegation. The results confirm the complexity of motivations for filing false allegations and the difficulties associated with archival studies. In conclusion, the list of Kanin is, based on the current results, valid but insufficient to explain all the different motives of <b>complainants</b> to file a false allegation...|$|R

Because the <b>complainant</b> died during the injunction process, a lower court had dismissed the case, but the Supreme Court of the Nation, granted the injunction and ordered recognition of the marriage by both the state of Puebla and the IMSS. The injunction required IMSS to extend benefits equal to married heterosexual couples' benefits to gays and lesbians who are married or have entered into civil unions throughout Mexico.|$|E

Retaliation can even involve further sexual harassment, and also stalking and cyberstalking of the victim. Moreover, a school professor or employer accused of sexual harassment, or who is the colleague of a perpetrator, can use their power to see that a victim is never hired again(blacklisting), or never accepted to another school.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A common {{finding in}} several studies is patients' dissatisfaction with {{complaint}} handling in health care. The reasons why {{are for the}} greater part unknown. The key to an answer {{may be found in}} a better understanding of patients' expectations. We investigated patients' expectations of complaint handling in hospitals. METHODS: Subjects were patients who had lodged a complaint at the complaint committees of 74 hospitals in the Netherlands. A total of 424 patients (response 75 %) completed a written questionnaire {{at the start of the}} complaint procedures. Derived from justice theory, we asked what they expected from fair procedures, fair communication and fair outcome of complaint handling. RESULTS: The predominant reason for <b>complainants</b> to lodge a complaint was to prevent the incident from happening again. <b>Complainants</b> expected fair procedures from the complaint committee, in particular an impartial position. This was most important to 87 % of the <b>complainants.</b> They also expected to be treated respectfully. Furthermore, they expected the hospital and the professional involved to respond to their complaint. A change in hospital performances was the most wanted outcome of complaint handling, according to 79 % of the <b>complainants.</b> They also expected disclosure from the professionals. Professionals should admit a mistake when it had occurred. More <b>complainants</b> (65 %) considered it most important to get an explanation than an apology (41 %). Only 32 % of <b>complainants</b> expected the professional to make an effort to restore the doctor-patient relationship. A minority of <b>complainants</b> (7 %) wanted financial compensation. CONCLUSION: Nearly all <b>complainants</b> want to prevent the incident from happening again, not out of pure altruism, but in order to restore their sense of justice. We conclude that complaint handling that does not allow for change is unlikely to meet patients' expectations. Secondly, complaint handling should not be left exclusively to complaint committees, the responses of hospital and professionals are indispensable. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>complainants,</b> Abdul Malik bin Sukor, an undischarged bankrupt, and his wife, Mislia binte Yusof, {{wished to}} sell their Housing and Development Board flat in Woodlands. They sought {{the help of a}} real estate agent named Rudolph Khoo, who {{informed}} them that Malik would have to be discharged from his bankruptcy before they could sell their flat. Khoo offered to help the <b>complainants</b> obtain a loan of S$25,000, to be repaid upon the sale of the flat. To facilitate these procedures, Khoo introduced a lawyer, Alan Shankar s/o (son of) Anant Kulkarni, to the <b>complainants,</b> who was to assist them in applying for a discharge from bankruptcy on Malik's behalf, acting for them in the sale of their flat, and documenting several loans that they had procured from one Chiang Bin Kwang. The loans from Chiang were to be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the flat. Following this, Mislia asked for two more loans from Chiang, which Shankar helped to arrange. In total, she signed three agreements to borrow a sum of $88,500, consisting of $45,000, $30,000 and $13,500 on three separate occasions. However, Mislia claimed she only received $40,000, consisting of $25,000, $10,000 and $5,000 on each of the occasions. Four years later, the <b>complainants</b> lodged a complaint against Shankar with the Law Society of Singapore. Following an investigation, Shankar was tried by the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society and convicted of three counts of grossly improper conduct contrary to section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act. The charges were based on allegations that Shankar had acted for both the <b>complainants</b> and Chiang without advising the <b>complainants</b> of the consequences of this conflict of interest, that he had not taken full instructions from the <b>complainants,</b> that he had asked the <b>complainants</b> to sign documents without properly explaining their effect, and that he had not ascertained whether the sums of money that Chiang paid to Mislia were in line with the loan agreements.|$|R
