25|$|The {{economic}} {{history of the}} colony was {{closely related to the}} economic health of the mother country. Despite increasing returns from the Dutch system of land tax, Dutch finances had been severely affected by the cost of the Java War and the Padri War, and the Dutch loss of Belgium in 1830 brought the Netherlands to the brink of bankruptcy. In 1830, a new Governor-General, Johannes van den Bosch, was appointed to make the Indies pay their way through Dutch exploitation of its resources. With the Dutch achieving political domination throughout Java {{for the first time in}} 1830, it was possible to introduce an agricultural policy of government-controlled forced cultivation. Termed cultuurstelsel (<b>cultivation</b> <b>system)</b> in Dutch and tanam paksa (forced plantation) in Indonesian, farmers were required to deliver, as a form of tax, fixed amounts of specified crops, such as sugar or coffee. Much of Java became a Dutch plantation and revenue rose continually through the 19th century which were reinvested into the Netherlands to save it from bankruptcy. Between 1830 and 1870, 1 billion guilders (€10.5 billion 2016) were taken from Indonesia, on average making 25 per cent of the annual Dutch Government budget. The <b>Cultivation</b> <b>System,</b> however, brought much economic hardship to Javanese peasants, who suffered famine and epidemics in the 1840s.|$|E

However, other sources claimed the Dutch's <b>Cultivation</b> <b>system</b> is linked to famines and epidemics in the 1840s, firstly in Cirebon and then Central Java, as cash crops such as indigo and sugar had to be grown instead of rice. Furthermore, the age of first marriage dropped during the 19th century thus increasing a woman's child bearing years.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Protected <b>cultivation</b> <b>systems</b> {{are used}} {{throughout}} {{the world as a}} powerful instrument to produce crops.

They range from fully passive “solar greenhouses” with thick energy storage walls as found in China to the high-tech “closed greenhouses” in Western Europe. This variety is due to local conditions, including the local climate, the availability of resources like water, energy, capital, labor and materials, local legislation and social aspects, to mention a few.

25|$|Although {{the war had}} {{severely}} exhausted the Dutch finances, the pacification of Java {{enabled the}} colonial government of Dutch East Indies to implement Cultuurstelsel ("The Culture System") in Java, without any local opposition.

Commodity prices recovered from the recession, leading to increased investment in the colony. The sugar, tin, copra and coffee trade on which the colony had been built thrived, and rubber, tobacco, tea and oil also became principal exports. Political reform increased the autonomy of the local colonial administration, moving away from central control from the Netherlands, whilst power was also diverged from the central Batavia government to more localised governing units.|$|E

Factors for the great population growth include the impact of Dutch colonial rule including the imposed end to civil war in Java, the increase in the area under rice cultivation, and the introduction of food plants such as casava and maize that could sustain populations that could not afford rice.

Van Hoëvell was a proponent of private ownership, and argued that the system, besides being immoral, was also economically ineffective. His criticism of Dutch colonial practices extended to the Dutch West India Company; he was a supporter of abolitionism at a time when Dutch colonists owned tens of thousands of slaves, mainly on plantations in Surinam.|$|E

However, many crops are currently unsuited to these environments, particularly closed <b>cultivation</b> <b>systems,</b> due to space limitations, low light intensity, high implementation costs, and high energy requirements. A major barrier to closed <b>system</b> <b>cultivation</b> is the high running cost, which necessitates the use of high-margin crops for economic viability.

In addition, it is important to develop cultivars equipped with growth parameters that are suitable for closed cultivation. Small plant size is of particular importance due to the limited cultivation space.

40|$|Intercropping and {{agroforestry}} {{are mixed}} plant species <b>cultivation</b> <b>systems</b> that can potentially reduce pressure {{on land and}} water resources by generating higher crop yields and by increasing resource use efficiencies through exploitation of complementarities between species. While it is frequently claimed that mixed <b>cultivation</b> <b>systems</b> remain popular in Chinese agriculture, there are also reports {{that it is in}} decline. Little quantitative evidence is available on the prevalence of intercropping and agroforestry. Therefore, we conducted a village-level survey in 68 villages across six provinces in China in 2014 to document the prevalence of these mixed species <b>cultivation</b> <b>systems</b> in 2009 and 2014. We found that intercropping was practiced on approximately three percent of the arable land in the surveyed villages, while agroforestry was practiced on approximately one percent of the arable land and one percent of the area of plantation plus forest land. The use of both systems did not significantly change between 2009 and 2014. An explorative village-level analysis of factors associated with mixed species cultivation practices reveals a significant positive association with labour availability, and a smaller, but mostly significant, negative association with agricultural machinery power. These survey results provide the first systematically collected quantitative evidence on the current use and trend of mixed <b>cultivation</b> <b>systems</b> in China.

2500|$|By {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, the colonial {{control of the}} Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) had passed from the Dutch East India Company (VOC) to the Dutch {{government}} due to the economic failure of the VOC. [...] In order to increase revenue, the Dutch colonial government implemented a series of policies termed the <b>Cultivation</b> <b>System</b> (Dutch: cultuurstelsel), which mandated Indonesian farmers to grow a quota of commercially crops such as sugar and coffee, instead of growing staple foods such as rice. [...] At the same time, the colonial government also implemented a tax collection {{system in which the}} collecting agents were paid by commission. The combination of these two strategies caused widespread abuse of colonial power, especially on the islands of Java and Sumatra, resulting in abject poverty and widespread starvation the farmers. The colony was governed with a minimum of soldiers and Government officials. The former rulers maintained their absolute power and control over the natives. A quite common strategy used by many colonizing countries.|$|E
60|$|It {{is universally}} {{admitted}} {{that when a}} country increases rapidly in population, the people cannot be very greatly oppressed or very badly governed. The present system of raising a revenue by the cultivation of coffee and sugar, sold to Government at a fixed price, began in 1832. Just before this, in 1826, the population by census was 5,500,000, while {{at the beginning of}} the century it was estimated at 3,500,000. In 1850, when the <b>cultivation</b> <b>system</b> had been in operation eighteen years, the population by census was over 9,500,000, or an increase of 73 per cent in twenty-four years. At the last census, in 1865, it amounted to 14,168,416, an increase of very nearly 50 per cent in fifteen years--a rate which would double the population in about twenty-six years. As Java (with Madura) contains about 38,500 geographical square miles, this will give an average of 368 persons to the square mile, just double that of the populous and fertile Bengal Presidency as given in Thornton's Gazetteer of India, and fully one-third more than that of Great Britain and Ireland at the last Census. If, as I believe, this vast population is on the whole contented and happy, the Dutch Government should consider well before abruptly changing a system which has led to such great results.|$|E
