50|$|These field {{effects are}} {{reversed}} when {{the direction of}} spin is reversed. It is therefore difficult to build an efficient reversible commutated dynamo, since for highest field strength {{it is necessary to}} move the brushes to {{the opposite side of the}} normal neutral plane.

5000|$|A <b>compensation</b> <b>winding</b> in a DC {{shunt motor}} is a winding {{in the field}} pole face plate that carries {{armature}} current to reduce stator field distortion. Its purpose is to reduce brush arcing and erosion in DC motors that are operated with weak fields, variable heavy loads or reversing operation such as steel-mill motors. When flux from the armature current is about equal to the flux from the field current, the flux at the field pole plate is shifted. Under a fixed load, there is an optimal commutation point for the brushes that minimizes arcing and erosion of the brushes. When the ratio of armature flux to field flux varies greatly or reverses, the optimum commutation point shifts as result of the varying flux at the pole face plate. The result is arcing of the brushes. By adding a compensating winding in the pole face plate that carries armature current {{in the opposite direction}} of current in the adjacent armature windings, the position of the flux at the pole face plate can be restored to the position it would have with zero armature current. The main drawback of a <b>compensation</b> <b>winding</b> is the expense.|$|E

40|$|As a {{renewable}} energy, wind power, most {{is anticipated}} to contributed {{a significant part}} of the generation in power systems in the future, but also bring new problems related to the integration of power quality, consisting mainly of voltage control and reactive power <b>compensation.</b> <b>wind</b> power generally dose not contribute to voltage control in the system. induction machines are mostly used as generators in wind power production based. induction generators used in wind turbines and wind farms consume a large amount of reactive power. next, since there is no voltage control of induction machines installed and draw reactive power from the power system, these machines are a source of of voltage fluctuations. therefore, a combination of wind turbines for power networks, especially the poor distribution network is one of the major concerns of power system studies. reactive power compensation and power quality in the poor distribution networks to connect the wind turbines are a big task for this thesis. this work was simulated using matlab / simulink for a weak distribution network and the integration of wind power in the network. without reactive power <b>compensation</b> of <b>wind</b> power in the network, the collapse of the system voltage and under voltage tripping of wind generators occur. for dynamic reactive power compensation, as statcom (static synchronous compensator) and capacitors are used at the point of interconnection of wind farms and networks, the system absorbs the generated wind power while maintaining its voltage level. as a result the study shows that, reactive power compensation by statcom and capacitor banks make it possible the combination of wind farm in a weak distribution network...|$|R
50|$|The Rosenberg {{generator}} is {{very similar}} to the Metadyne generator, both in its construction and its electrical connection. It generally does not have a <b>compensation</b> <b>winding,</b> so that the whole of the armature reaction opposes the initial excitation. Parts of the magnetic circuit are normally not laminated, which creates delays between excitations and fluxes, but the machines are used in applications where a quick response is not essential. Their predominant use has been in trains, where they are axle-driven, and used to provide lighting and the charging of batteries. An axle-driven generator is subject to variable speeds and changes in the direction of rotation, but the characteristics of the machine allow it to produce useful energy down to very low speeds. At slow speeds, the output voltage increases with the square of the speed, but the magnetic circuit soon becomes saturated, resulting in much smaller increases as the speed increases. When used in circuits which include batteries charged from the output, a rectifier or reverse-current cut-out is normally required to prevent discharge of the batteries through the generator at very low speeds, or when the train stops.|$|E
50|$|The diagram shows three {{arrangements}} of a metadyne machine. In all cases, compensation windings have been omitted for clarity. The first arrangement represents a one-cycle cross-field machine. In a normal DC machine, {{the effect of}} the excitation current generates a flux (A1), which in turn generates a quadrature flux which is at right angles to the exciting flux. By wiring the quadrature brushes together, current is produced in the armature, and the flux that this produces (A2) is again at right angles to the quadrature axis, resulting in an armature reaction which is directly opposed to the original excitation. This feature is fundamental to the machine, and does not depend on its direction of rotation. When the armature reaction is partially compensated by a <b>compensation</b> <b>winding,</b> the uncompensated portion of the armature reaction acts in this way. As the output current rises, it suppresses {{the effect of the}} excitation, until it reaches a state where there is just enough excitation to maintain the current. Any further increase would eliminate the flux which sustains its operation, and the current is maintained irrespective of the resistance of the load or the back emf produced by it. The machine thus acts as a constant-current generator, where the current is proportional to the excitation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} recently towards integrating more renewable energy resources, in particular wind power, in form of distributed generation (DG) units. However, one important challenge with wind DG units is to provide low-cost and fast-responding reactive power <b>compensation</b> of the <b>wind</b> turbine’s inductive load to ensure a stable voltage profile in the system. Since reactive power can only be compensated locally, we consider a scenario where a wind DG unit is co-located with a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging station or a parking lot, and we investigate how to align incentives to encourage PEV owners to participate in reactive power <b>compensation</b> for <b>wind</b> DG units. For this purpose, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage Stackelberg game between the wind DG unit and the PEV owners.

The technique is well established, but {{much remains to}} be understood regarding its practical upper frequency limit. Typically, zero-flux systems consist of a measuring head mounted around the primary current carrier and an electronic unit creating a balancing current in the <b>compensation</b> <b>winding.</b> In this paper the phenomena responsible for the frequency dependency of the phase angle error in zero-flux systems in the span 5 Hz – 10 kHz are described using two-channel power measuring systems as reference systems.

At higher frequencies, the error passes a maximum in transition between the normal operation and the work regime as an ordinary transformer.

A potentially-promising compensatory project that reduces eagle mortality from power line electrocution is suggested to generate the environmental gains (credit), which is quantified using hypothetical data. Pending completion of on-going research, this framework could be applied with actual data to inform future compensation at Smøla.

40|$|The paper summarises the {{refereed}} {{contributions of}} seven articles reviewed {{for publication in}} the IJETP Special Issue on "Reactive <b>compensation</b> for <b>wind</b> farms". The main goal of the special issue {{is to provide a}} forum to exchange information on the reactive power <b>compensation</b> requirements for <b>wind</b> farms and introducing possible price mechanisms for today's deregulated power industry. Uncompensated reactive power causes stress on the hosting utility grid as well as added expenses, which create in difficulties for power purchasing agreements from independent wind energy producers. Wind power producers need to comply with the hosting utility grid interconnection standards, e. g., voltage and frequency, as well as to provide controllable active and reactive sources of power. Active power supply is mainly dependent on the potential of wind power produced and the turbine design. Reactive power demand on the other hand depends on the conversion devices and the recovered power quantity fed to the grid. Static Var Compensators (SVC), Unified Power Quality Conditioners (UPQC), Unified Power Flow Controllers (UPFC), and the Distributed Static Synchronous Compensators (DSTATCOM) are all new emerging devices aimed at regulating the reactive power requirements. The excellent controllability of these devices has paved the way to flexible and dynamic controllers that are capable of regulating the flow of active and reactive power components. These devices are now suggested for the control of the reactive power requirement of wind generators. Studies have demonstrated acceptable voltage stabilisation results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to the problem of optimal sizing of energy storage required for <b>compensation</b> of <b>wind</b> farm generation variability. Using wind farm production data from the BPA, we assess the effect of forecast quality and economic dispatch timing on the size of storage and critical power rating required to nearly perfectly match the committed energy. We develop a Model-Predictive-Control (MPC) based operational model following NERC standard recommendations. Different forecasts are considered and compared from the storage sizing perspective. The results of our simulations can be fit by two simple relations, connecting the storage sizing with forecast error, wind variability, and the timescales of scheduling. A more accurate forecast reduces the storage sizing. However, diminishing returns are observed when the forecast error becomes comparable to natural wind variability within the commitment time interval.
