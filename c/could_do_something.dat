As an example of this, Hall & Greenbergfound that even for a very reflective scene, using this with a maximum depth of 15 resulted in an average ray tree depth of 1.7.|$|E
25|$|While {{trying to}} support his family, Knievel {{recalled}} the Joie Chitwood show he saw as a boy and decided that he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> similar using a motorcycle. Promoting the show himself, Knievel rented the venue, wrote the press releases, set up the show, sold the tickets and served as his own master of ceremonies. After enticing the small crowd with a few wheelies, he proceeded to jump a twenty-foot-long box of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions. Despite landing short and having his back wheel hit the box containing the rattlesnakes, Knievel managed to land safely.|$|E

[...] However, following the success of noitulovE, three additional commercials have been aired within the Good Things... campaign: Fridge, Hands, and Tipping Point (Guinness' most expensive advertising campaign to date).|$|E

[...] Hole's classic track [...] "Violet" [...] features the lyrics [...] "And the sky was all violet / I want it again, but violent, more violent", alluding to lyrics from Smith's [...] "Kimberly".

500|$|The {{founders of}} Circus Juventas, Dan and Betty Butler, met as {{teenagers}} at the Sailor Circus of Sarasota during the mid-1970s. Dan was a catcher on the flying trapeze, and Betty was an aerialist on the cloud swing. They began dating at age sixteen, {{went on to}} perform at Florida State University's Flying High Circus, and married in 1980. Dan became a successful real estate broker in Atlanta, but faced bankruptcy and chemical dependency. The couple came to reside in Minnesota because Dan Butler was receiving {{alcohol and drug abuse}} rehabilitation at Hazelden. The Butlers attended Sailor Circus reunions together and after one, in April 1994, Betty Butler wondered, [...] "Wouldn't it be great if we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> in ?" ...|$|E

Unlike {{previous}} Grand Theft Auto games which have a strong cultural or cinematic influence, [...] " [...] really have any cinematic influences", as explained by Houser. [...] "We were consciously trying to go, well, if video games are going to develop into the next stage, then the thing isn't {{to try and do}} a loving tribute or reference other stuff. It's to reference the actual place itself". Houser also said, [...] "In terms of the character, we wanted something that felt fresh and new and not something that was obviously derived from [...] movie. [...] Maybe [...] <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> ourselves that would live alongside that stuff".|$|E

Speaking of Jacqui's sudden change of heart, Cooper states: [...] "He pulls out a knife. That changes the situation - the dynamic changes immediately. He <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> really horrible to her - it's not necessarily about killing someone, he could slash her face or anything. In a situation like that, your mind plays tricks as you wonder what someone could do to you." [...] Cooper has spoken of her feelings of responsibility to portray it correctly and stated [...] "I wanted to show how horrendous it was for Jacqui. She wonders whether she could die like this - all to protect her family…" ...|$|E
500|$|Recent reviews {{have also}} applauded the episode. Shearman and Pearson rated the episode five stars out of five, {{describing}} it as [...] " [...] delightful...comic fable". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that it [...] "works {{because it takes}} this very silly idea and proceeds to take it seriously." [...] He criticized the program for its [...] "corniness" [...] and its reliance on the [...] "magical black guy" [...] stereotype, but concluded that [...] "The Unnatural" [...] was successful [...] "because it embraces {{this side of the}} show’s profile [...] <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> sweet and lovely and moving". VanDerWerff also complimented Martin's performance, calling his acting [...] "terrific". Cynthia Fuchs from PopMatters wrote that Duchovny's directing debut was excellent.|$|E
500|$|Hugh Syme {{provided}} the artwork for Octavarium. The idea of depicting a giant Newton's cradle was {{born out of}} discussions between Syme and Portnoy. The two talked about how [...] "for everything you do in music you create either a cluster or triad", according to Syme. [...] "And then it became evident that for every action there is an opposite reaction. So I thought we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> based on the Newton's cradle." [...] There are numerous references to the numbers five and eight throughout the artwork, alluding to the album's concept. For example, the Newton's cradle has eight suspended balls, and there are five birds on the cover. The album booklet features an octagonal maze, spider and octopus, among other references. The landscape on the cover is made up of a sky and grass from Indiana, and a background from the Lake District.|$|E

500|$|Matheos {{originally}} intended the first OSI album as a [...] "project" [...] which would never produce a second album. For Free, Matheos and Moore {{wanted to use}} a different musician lineup to focus OSI on primarily being Matheos and Moore. They {{did not want to}} give the impression that the guests on the first album were part of the band. Matheos stated that the music on Free was [...] "focused less on the progressive elements or the metal elements that were on the first record. We thought we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> just a little more groove oriented." [...] Matheos and Moore had both worked with bassist Joey Vera in the past and considered him [...] "perfect" [...] for the album. Moore was pleased with Vera's bass parts: Vera sent them to Moore in a state such that they required very little editing or enhancement for the final mix of the album.|$|E

[...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved to myself that I <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance {{to go to college and}} you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E

A television presenter for the public broadcasting program American Experience, McCullough said he once asked Stanley Marcus– [...] "one of the wisest men I know"– what single problem or aspect of American life, if given a magic wand, he would change, to which Marcus replied, [...] "I'd try to do something about television."

500|$|Within {{a year of}} Louise Harrison's death, Harry {{was staying}} in Los Angeles with Harrison and Boyd, while Harrison worked with Ravi Shankar on the soundtrack to the film Raga. A Bengali Hindu, Shankar was distraught at {{the news of the}} {{humanitarian}} disaster then occurring in East Pakistan, following the outbreak of the Bangladesh Liberation War in March 1971. After fleeing the war zone in their homeland, an estimated 7 million refugees were being accommodated in inadequate camps in India, where diseases such as cholera had become rife. Shankar later recalled that Harrison was deeply moved by his request for help in aiding the Bengali refugees, as a result of which he committed to staging the Concert for Bangladesh in New York that summer. Author Elliot Huntley suggests that, having been incapable of assuaging his mother's pain as she lay dying in 1970, Harrison gained extra motivation from [...] "a situation his fame and commercial cache <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to alleviate".|$|E
500|$|After the {{positive}} {{response to the}} opening sequence by Banksy, creator Matt Groening and Jean came to Kricfalusi {{and asked him if}} he <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> similar. Originally, they only wanted him to do the storyboards and then let their regular crew animate it, but Kricfalusi insisted on doing the animation himself, explaining that [...] "If we had done it that way, no one would even have known that I {{had anything to do with}} it because it would have ended up on model and all pose to pose". [...] On The Simpsons, the animators draw key poses and then let tweeners interpolate between those poses. The interpolation however, is a straight a to b animation. That way the animation ends up having the characters just going from pose to pose. Kricfalusi explains that on The Simpsons he [...] "wanted to try moving the characters in crazy fun ways, not just looking funny each time they come to a stop", and further elaborated [...] "that the way things happened was even more important than what was happening in my work. You can’t write visual performance. You have to actually draw it." ...|$|E
