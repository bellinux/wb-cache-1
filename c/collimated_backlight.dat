In order to make display device optimized for different {{function of}} the mobile phone, this paper proposes a display device which can be switched among 2 D direct view, 3 D direct view and projection modes while using single liquid crystal(LC) panel as image source. The device features a highly <b>collimated</b> <b>backlight</b> unit and polymer dispersed liquid crystal(PDLC) diffuser {{at the back of}} the LC panel, and a switchable lenticular array as well as a stretchable projection lens in front. The ray tracing simulation has shown well controlled light path of the backlight module and sufficient image quality of the projection lens while maintaining the compactness of the device for mobile application. 1...|$|E

For energies Ei � 100 MeV/u, the total deposited specific energy, ɛ, isin principle known with a good accuracy. When {{the density of the}} heated sample, ρ 0, remains unchanged, the thermodynamic state of matter after irradiation is completely defined by ɛ and ρ 0. In this case any measured physical quantity is determined as a function of this well defined thermodynamic state. The governing parameter for volumetric heating of matter is the specific energy deposition. For our analysis a specific energy of 130 kJ/g deposited in solid hydrogen was chosen. According to the SESEAME equation of state, this corresponds to a temperature of about 0. 6 eV (warm dense matter regime), if the beam energy is fully converted into internal energy. A corresponding SIS- 18 beam would consist of 8 × 10 10 uranium ions of 200 MeV/u focused to abeamspotradiusrb= 350 µm (standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution). The choice of materials for our target is dictated primarily by the proposed method of diagnostics, which is based on the measurement of the spectral and angular distributions of x-rays scattered by the heated sample [1]. At GSI, a time-resolved x-ray <b>backlighter</b> (<b>collimated</b> or focused) can be driven by the Phelix laser. However, with probe x-rays in the keV range, we are restricted to targets consisting of low-Z elements. It is very advantageous to have a homogeneous density distribution in the target volume for diagnostics and interpretation of the scattering data. ion beam PHELIX x−ray probe bea...|$|R
