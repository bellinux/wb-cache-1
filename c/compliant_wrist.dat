The device provides the robot system the necessary flexibility which accommodates transitions as the robot makes contact with the environment, corrects positioning error in automatic assembly, avoids high impact forces and protects the surface from damage. The device also supplies the displacement sensing of the passive compliance so that active feedback control is possible. This report is intended {{to serve as a}} reference material to introduce the control software of the robot <b>compliant</b> <b>wrist</b> system developed and implemented in the lab. The detail discussion on system performance and parameters selection {{can be found in the}} thesis [3]. The rest of material is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the compliance control methods of robot manipulators. The historic development of both passive and active compliance method is discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods are investigated. Based on the unsolved problems in this issue, the six-degree freedom <b>compliant</b> <b>wrist</b> is developed, and the design feature is presented. Section 3 discusses the hybrid position/force control scheme using the sensing information from the device. The positioning error due to load or external force when robot moves in free space is compensated for, so that the effective stiffness is increased. In force control when robot is constrained by environment, the trajectory is modified by sensed force, so that the effective stiffness is decreased. Section 4 deals with the implementation of the control scheme. Various programs have been developed to perform the hybrid control operations, such as hybrid control demonstration, surface tracking, edge tracking, insertion and pulling out, and writing operation. The programs have been successfully implemented in the experiments. Definition and selection of the parameters in the programs are discussed.

Hybrid position/force control is important in most robotic tasks; accurate position control is needed in unconstrained directions, and accurate force control is needed in constrained directions.

40|$|Compliance {{has been}} {{exploited}} in various forms in robotic systems to allow rigid mechanisms to {{come into contact with}} fragile objects, or with complex shapes that cannot be accurately modeled. Force feedback control has been the classical approach for providing compliance in robotic systems. However, by integrating other forms of instrumentation with compliance into a single device, it is possible to extend close monitoring of nearby objects before and after contact occurs. As a result, safer and smoother robot control can be achieved both while approaching and while touching surfaces. This paper presents the design and extensive experimental evaluation of a versatile, lightweight, and low-cost instrumented <b>compliant</b> <b>wrist</b> mechanism which can be mounted on any rigid robotic manipulator in order to introduce a layer of compliance while providing the controller with extra sensing signals during close interaction with an object’s surface. Arrays of embedded range sensors provide real-time measurements on the position and orientation of surfaces, either located in proximity or in contact with the robot’s end-effector, which permits close guidance of its operation. Calibration procedures are formulated to overcome inter-sensor variability and achieve the highest available resolution.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Robots are widely used as substitutes for humans in situations involving repetitive tasks where a precise and repeatable motion is required. Sports technology is an area which has seen {{an increase in the}} implementation of robots which simulate specific human motions required for a sport. One purpose is to test sports equipment, where the requirement is for a motion to be performed with consistent variables. One issue which has arisen frequently in the robot simulation of humans is the inherent presence of vibration excited in a flexible object being manipulated by a robot, and this issue is not unfounded in the situation presented in this research, of a golf robot manipulating a flexible golf club during the simulation of a golf swing. It had been found that during robotic simulations of golf swings performed with the Miyamae Robo V at the Sports Technology Institute at Loughborough University, swing variables such as shaft deformation and clubhead orientation were dissimilar to those measured for human golf swings. Vibrations present in the golf club were identified as the key cause of the disparity between human and robot swing variables. This research sought to address this issue and find a method which could be applied to reduce clubhead vibrations present in robot simulations of a golf swing to improve their similarity to human swings. This would facilitate the use of the golf robot for equipment testing and club fitting. Golf swing variables were studied and measured for 14 human subjects with the aim being to understand the motion that the robot is required to simulate. A vibration damping gripper was then fitted to the robot to test the effect that changing the interface between the robot-excited vibrations and the club would have, this was achieved with a selection of silicone sleeves with differing material properties which could be attached to the club. Preliminary results showed a noticeable reduction in clubhead vibrations and this solution was investigated further. Mathematically modelling the robot was seen as the most suitable method for this as it meant the robot remained functional and allowed a number of solutions to be tested. Several iterations of a mathematical model were developed with the final model being structurally similar to the robot {{with the addition of a}} <b>compliant</b> grip and <b>wrist.</b> The method by which the robot is driven was also recognised as having a large effect on the level of vibration excited in the clubhead and the methodology behind generating smooth robot swing profiles is presented. The mathematical model was used to perform 6 swings and the resulting shaft deformation and clubhead vibration were compared with data from human swings. It was found that the model was capable of producing swing variables comparable to human swings, however in the downswing portion of the swing the magnitude of these variables were larger for the simulations. Simulations were made which sought to demonstrate the difference between the model replicating the rigid robot and a compliant system. Reductions in vibration were achieved in all swings, including those driven with robot feedback data which contains oscillations excited by the method with which the robot is driven...|$|R

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} control law for a {{manipulator}} {{with the aim}} of realizing desired time-varying motion/force profiles {{in the presence of a}} stiff environment. In many cases, the interaction with the environment affects only one degree of freedom of the end-effector of the manipulator. Therefore, the focus is on this contact degree of freedom, and a switching position-force controller is proposed to perform the hybrid position-force tracking task. Sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee input-to-state stability of the switching closed-loop system with respect to perturbations related to the time-varying desired motion-force profile. The switching occurs when the manipulator makes or breaks contact with the environment. The analysis shows that to guarantee closed-loop stability while tracking arbitrary time-varying motion-force profiles, the controller should implement a considerable (and often unrealistic) amount of damping, resulting in inferior tracking performance.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} an instrumented <b>compliant</b> <b>wrist</b> mechanism which serves as an interface between robotic platforms and their environments in order to detect surface positions and orientations. Although inspired by similar existing devices, additional features such as noncontact distance estimations, a simplified physical structure, and wireless operation were incorporated into the design. The primary role envisioned for this mechanism was for enabling robotic manipulators to perform surface following tasks prior to contact as this was one requirement of a larger project involving inspection of surfaces. The information produced by the <b>compliant</b> <b>wrist</b> system can be used to guide robotic devices in their workspace by providing real-time proximity detection and collision detection of objects. Compliance in robotic devices has attracted the attention of many researchers due to the multitude of benefits it offers. In the scope of this work, the main advantage of compliance is that it allows rigid structures to come into contact with possibly fragile objects. Combined with instrumentation for detecting the deflections produced by this compliance, closed-loop control can be achieved, increasing the number of viable applications for an initially open-loop system. Custom fabrication of a prototype device was completed to physically test operation of the designed system. The prototype incorporates a microcontroller to govern the internal operations of the device such as sensor data collection and processing. By performing many computation tasks directly on the device, robotic controllers are able to dedicate more of their time to more important tasks such as path planning and object avoidance by using the pre-conditioned compliant device data. Extensive work has also gone into the refinement of sensor signals coming from the key infrared distance measurement sensors used in the device. A calibration procedure was developed to decrease inter-sensor variability due to the method of manufacturing of these sensors. Noise reduction in the signals is achieved via a digital filtering process. The evaluation of the performance of the device is achieved through the collection of a large amount of sensor data for use in characterisation of the sensor and overall system behavior. This {{comes in the form of}} a statistical analysis of the sensor outputs to determine signal stability and accuracy. Additionally, the operation of the device is validated by its integration onto a manipulator robot and incorporating the data generated into the robot’s control loop...|$|E
40|$|This work {{considers}} {{the control of}} a manipulator {{with the aim of}} executing desired time-varying motion–force trajectories {{in the presence of a}} stiff environment. In several situations, the interaction with the environment constrains just one degree of freedom of the manipulator end-effector. Focusing on this contact degree of freedom, a switching position–force controller is considered to perform the hybrid motion–force tracking task. To guarantee input-to-state stability of the switching closed-loop system, a novel stability result and sufficient conditions are presented. The switching occurs when the manipulator makes or breaks contact with the environment. The analysis shows that to guarantee closed-loop stability while tracking arbitrary time-varying motion–force profiles with a rigid manipulator, the controller should implement a considerable (and often unrealistic) amount of damping, resulting in inferior tracking performance.

40|$|Teleprogramming was {{developed}} {{as a solution to}} problems of teleoperation systems with significant time delays [5]. In teleprogramming, the human operator interacts in real time with a graphical model of the remote site, which provides for real time visual and force feedback. The master system automatically generates symbolic commands based on the motions of the master arm and the manipulator/model interactions, given predefined criteria of what types of motions are to be expected. These commands are then sent via a communication link, which may delay the signals, to the remote site. Based upon a remote world model, predefined and possibly refined as more information is obtained, the slave carries out commanded operations in the remote world and decides whether each step has been executed correctly.

40|$|This {{document}} proposes {{the development}} of the remote site workcell for teleoperation with significant communication delays (on the order of one to 20 seconds). In these situations, direct teleoperation becomes difficult to impossible due to the delays in visual and force feedback. Teleprogramming has been developed in order to overcome this problem. In teleprogramming, the human operator interacts in real time with a graphical model of the remote site, which provides for real time visual and force feedback. The master arm and the manipulator/model interactions, given predefined criteria of what types of motions are to be expected. These commands are then sent via a communication link, which may delay the signals, to the remote site.

40|$|An {{original}} model-based tactile 3 -D {{object recognition}} system is presented. The {{development of this}} system was motivated by {{the need for a}} "blind" back-up solution to maintain the object recognition capability of the Space Shuttle robot manipulator when the sun light blinds the video-cameras normally used for object recognition. Tactile object recognition requires the identification of the explored object as well as the recovery of its 3 -D position and orientation. Such a complex task calls for a robotic tactile sensing system whose parameters (spatial resolution, probing compliance, tactile image processing) are beyond those usually offered by the emergent tactile sensing technology. The development of the tactile sensing system described in this thesis has resulted in a number of contributions: (i) novel tab-shaped elastic overlay which reduces the cross-talk errors in the tactile sensor, (ii) instrumented passive <b>compliant</b> <b>wrist</b> for more efficient object exploration, and (iii) 2 -D correlation method for the integration of the local tactile images in a global image of the explored object surface. The original model-based tactile object recognition paradigm in this thesis can be summarized as follows: "Given a set of 3 -D objects having their surfaces Braille-like embossed with terms of a Pseudo-Random Array (PRA) for which is a priori known how the unfolded faces of geometrical models of these objects are mapped into the PRA plane, and given the tactile image of the explored object surfaces, determine the identity, position, and orientation of that object. " Tactile object recognition is thus reduced to the recognition of a small set of symbols embossed on object surfaces. The use of multi-valued (instead of the usual binary) pseudo-random encoding allows {{to reduce the number of}} embossed symbols which actually are needed to recognized in the tactile image. An original contribution is made by the development of a Pseudo-Random Multi-Valued Product Array (PRMVPA) encoding and related pseudo-random/natural code conversion algorithm. While it is inherently limited to a given set of embossed objects, the described "blind" method allows for a simpler and faster 3 -D object recognition using solely tactile sensing. Such an object recognition method has potential applications in controlled environments such as the Space Shuttle, nuclear stations, underwater maintenance of the oil platforms and pipelines...|$|E
