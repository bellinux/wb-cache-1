40|$|The {{wealth of}} the {{publicly}} available data repositories related to chemical compounds and substances allows current research methodologies to integrate pieces of information across different resources. Typically, current trends {{in the design and}} development of compoundto-compound relatedness measures try to infer commonalities between substances based on the 3 D representation of the compounds, sequential information of their targets, and toxicological liabilities. However, compared to the available <b>compound</b> <b>characteristics,</b> this subset is limited. In this paper we explore a novel direction towards compound-to-compound relatedness, which attempts to integrate a significantly larger number of <b>compound</b> <b>characteristics,</b> including <b>compound</b> structure and chemical properties, indications, related sequences, pathways, genes, toxicity, and other pharmacological information. The challenges that are posed are great; the heterogeneity of the available databases from which the different pieces of information are drawn, the diversity of the formats in which the data are offered, and the lack of a well established benchmark to evaluate compound-to-compound relatedness measures. We show how these challenges are addressed within our approach, and we attempt an evaluation of the suggested relatedness measure through a manually curated benchmark dataset. The main novelty of the work is the integration of the data and the combination of several similarity measures, including a string kernel, Jaccard and Tanimoto. Our results suggest that the proposed measure generates meaningful associations among the tested compounds; examples of these associations are presented and discussed analytically...|$|R

The "futile metabolism" of nitroaryl <b>compounds</b> <b>characteristic</b> of most aerobic nitroreductase systems reflects competition between natural radical-decay pathways and a one-electron transfer reaction to yield superoxide ion, O 2 -.

There are clear parallels in the chemistry of ArNO 2 - and O 2 -. While nitro radicals have frequently been invoked as damaging species, they are very unreactive (except as simple reductants).

40|$|D-alpha-Tocopherol {{polyethylene}} glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) -stabilized nanosuspensions (25 wt%, {{relative to the}} drug weight) were produced by media milling for 9 model drug compounds [cinnarizine, griseofulvin, indomethacin, itraconazole, loviride, mebendazole, naproxen, phenylbutazone and phenytoin]. After 3 months of storage at room temperature, Ostwald ripening occurred {{in all of the}} samples, except for indomethacin. Whereas lowering the temperature could slow down the ripening, it markedly increased upon storage at 40 degrees C. As for ripening, settling generally became more pronounced at 40 degrees C compared to 4 degrees C. As the nanosuspensions were afflicted by Ostwald ripening and settling, we explored nanosuspension drying as a strategy to circumvent these stability issues. Spray-drying and freeze-drying were evaluated for nanosuspensions and coarse reference suspensions of the compounds. Nanoparticle agglomeration could be visually observed in all of the powders. To evaluate the effect of agglomeration on the key characteristic of drug nanocrystals (i. e. rapid dissolution), dissolution experiments were performed under poor sink conditions. It was found that the compounds could be categorized into 3 groups: (i) compounds for which it was impossible to differentiate between coarse and nanosized products (griseofulvin, mebendazole, naproxen), (ii) compounds that gave clear differences in dissolution profiles between the nanosized and the coarse products, but for which drying of the nanosuspensions did not decrease the dissolution performance of the product (indomethacin, loviride, phenytoin) and (iii) compounds that showed differences between coarse and nanosized products, but for which drying of the nanosuspensions resulted in a significant decrease of the dissolution rate (cinnarizine, itraconazole, phenylbutazone). To gain insight on the influence of the drug <b>compound</b> <b>characteristics</b> on the dissolution of the dried products, the dissolution behavior of the compounds of the second and the third group was linked to the <b>compound's</b> <b>characteristics.</b> It was found that compounds with a more hydrophobic surface resulted in agglomerates which were harder to disintegrate, for which dissolution was compromised upon drying.

We developed a mathematical model simulating biologically relevant transport and HIV-neutralization processes occurring when semen-borne virus interacts with a microbicide delivery vehicle coating epithelium. The model enables analysis of how vehicle-related variables, and anti-HIV <b>compound</b> <b>characteristics,</b> affect microbicide performance.

Our findings demonstrate the need to pair potent active ingredients with well-engineered formulation vehicles, and highlight the importance of the dosage form in microbicide effectiveness.
