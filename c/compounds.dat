A repetitive compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E

The acetic acid (<b>compound</b> 1) and alcohol (<b>compound</b> 2) are converted to <b>compound</b> 3.

Although strontium {{is in the same}} group as magnesium, and organomagnesium <b>compounds</b> are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organostrontium <b>compounds</b> are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive. Organostrontium <b>compounds</b> tend to be more similar to organoeuropium or organosamarium <b>compounds</b> due to the similar ionic radii of these elements (Sr2+ 118pm; Eu2+ 117pm; Sm2+ 122pm).

5|$|Unlike the organolithium <b>compounds,</b> the {{organometallic}} <b>compounds</b> of {{the heavier}} alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The application of organosodium <b>compounds</b> in chemistry {{is limited in}} part due to competition from organolithium <b>compounds,</b> which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide. Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic <b>compounds</b> of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium <b>compounds</b> and of limited utility. A notable reagent is Schlosser's base, a mixture of n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide.
