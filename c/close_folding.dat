40|$|Detailed {{investigations}} in the Gander area have revealed {{the presence of}} two previously unrecognised terranes with contrasting structural, metamorphic and intrusive histories. These are named the metasedimentary terrane and the sedimentary and volcanic terrane. Older pre-Middle Ordovician polydeformed and metamorphosed rocks, mainly sediments of the Gander Group, are assigned to the metasedimentary terrane. The Gander Group is informally subdivided into the amphibolite-psammite member, the mixed member, and the pelite-mafic volcanic member. These members structurally overlie undifferentiated, predominantly psammitic metasediments of the group. The sedimentary and volcanic terrane includes the lower and upper members of the Davidsville Group. Mafic agglomerates occur {{at the base of}} this mid-Ordovician greywacke-slate sequence. [...] Intrusive into the Gander Group are schistose, pre- or early-kinematic garnetiferous leucocratic granite, mafic and ultramafic bodies, as well as late-kinematic 'porphyritic granite' and apparently undeformed gabbro and diabase. Early gabbro, pyroxenite and serpentinite, and post-tectonic diabase dykes intrude the Davidsville Group. [...] The Gander Group contains southeast facing, major recumbent F₂ folds, with two later crenulation fabrics and associated folds. Major structures are refolded into steep attitudes in the East near the contact with the basement, and in the West close to the Davidsville Group. This step-like refolding is considered to be Acadian (Devonian) in age. Rocks of the Gander Group have undergone greenschist to low amphibolite facies metamorphism, and local thermal overprinting. Within the Davidsville Group, upright open to <b>close</b> <b>folding</b> and later crenulation or kinking are attributed to the Acadian deformation. This terrane is much less recrystallized and of lower metamorphic grade (sub-greenschist facies). [...] Greywackes of the Davidsville Group contain metamorphic detritus derived from the metasedimentary terrane, indicating deformation, meta-morphism, uplift and erosion of the Gander Group before mid-Ordovician time. A fault now separates rocks of the metasedimentary terrane and volcanic terrane in the Gander area...|$|E

Genera of the Pyronemataceae lack unifying macroscopic or microscopic characteristics; this lack of uniting characters has led various authors to propose a variety of classification schemes.|$|R

40|$|The ultrafast excited-state {{dynamics}} {{underlying the}} receptor state photorecovery is {{resolved in the}} M 100 A mutant of the photoactive yellow protein (PYP) from Halorhodospira halophila. The M 100 A PYP mutant, with its distinctly slower photocycle than wt PYP, allows isolation of the pB signaling state for study of the photodynamics of the protonated chromophore cis-p-coumaric acid. Transient absorption signals indicate a subpicosecond excited-state proton-transfer reaction in the pB state that results in chromophore deprotonation prior to the cis-trans isomerization required in the photorecovery dynamics of the pG state. Two terminal photoproducts are observed, a blue-absorbing species presumed to be deprotonated trans-p-coumaric acid and an ultraviolet-absorbing protonated photoproduct. These two photoproducts are hypothesized to originate from an equilibrium of open and <b>closed</b> <b>folded</b> forms of the signaling state,...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{holographic}} model for local quench in 1 + 1 dimensional Conformal Field Theory (CFT). The local quench {{is produced by}} joining two identical CFT’s on semi-infinite lines. When these theories have a zero boundary entropy, we use the AdS/Boundary CFT proposal to describe this process in terms of bulk physics. Boundaries of the original CFT’s are extended in AdS as dynamical surfaces. In our holographic picture these surfaces detach from the boundary and form a <b>closed</b> <b>folded</b> string which can propagate in the bulk. The dynamics of this string is governed by the tensionless Yo-Yo string solution and its subsequent evolution determines the time dependence after quench. We use this model to calculate holographic Entanglement Entropy (EE) of an interval {{as a function of}} time. We propose how the falling string deforms Ryu-Takayanagi’s curves. Using the deformed curves we calculate EE and find complete agreement with field theory results...|$|R
