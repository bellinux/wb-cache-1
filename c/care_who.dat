5|$|Khal Drogo's khalasar {{arrives at}} the city of Vaes Dothrak. Viserys Targaryen impatiently waits for the army Drogo agreed to lend him, the bride price offered for his sister Daenerys, to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. When Viserys misinterprets Daenerys's {{invitation}} to dinner as an order, he becomes angry and strikes her. For the first time, Daenerys fights back, hitting her astounded brother and promising that if he raises a hand against her again, his hands will be cut off. Later, the banished knight Jorah Mormont tells her that Viserys {{would not be a}} good leader for the invasion of Westeros and, despite what Viserys believes, the people of the Seven Kingdoms do not <b>care</b> <b>who</b> rules them {{as long as they are}} ruled well. Daenerys agrees that Viserys could not conquer the Seven Kingdoms even if Khal Drogo gave him an entire army.|$|E

25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what you are doing when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't <b>care</b> <b>who</b> he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E

25|$|The Daintree River Ferry is a cable ferry {{across the}} Daintree River in Cape Tribulation. The ferry {{is the only}} cable ferry {{operating}} within tropical Australia and its daily hours of operation are between 06:00 and midnight. In July 2003, the Shire of Douglas overturned a motion to investigate {{the construction of a}} low-lying single lane bridge with a boom gate and a second ferry across the Daintree. Residents feared a bridge would threaten the rainforest due to a potential increase in traffic. Where as tourist operators stated a bridge would have boosted the local economy. Over the 2011 Easter long weekend, during a period when the ferry was free, tourists using the ferry dramatically increased and resorts were booked out. After Easter local tourism operators expressed a desire for the ferry to be free year-round but their suggestion was ignored. As of 1 July 2011, the cost of a return ticket for private use motor cars and utilities was $22. Limited annual quantities of Daintree ferry concessional travel policy applies to the following people: Cairns Regional Council ratepayers, residents, business operators and employees who work north of the Daintree River and are within the former Douglas Shire area; Queensland Health or Blue <b>Care</b> <b>who</b> travel across the Daintree Ferry {{in the course of their}} duties; and Residents of the Wujal Wujal Aboriginal Shire and some Cook Shire Council residents.|$|E
25|$|While {{returning}} to Spain, the Niña and Pinta encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, {{on the night}} of 13 February, lost contact with each other. All hands on the Niña vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the Azore Islands, but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the Niña laid anchor at Santa Maria Island, but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found to drop anchor nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Niña moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he {{and the rest of the}} crew stayed on the Niña, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members were saying their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, João de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the Niña, in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission for him to come aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or <b>care</b> <b>who</b> Columbus said that he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.|$|E

Beyoncé contributed to the writing and production processes, {{and it was one}} of the last tracks to be added to the album.

500|$|The {{character}} of Meacham also presents an unconventional take on Christian principles {{to support the}} film's main theme of redemption.

Meacham's dying words to Jake, [...] "God don't <b>care</b> <b>who</b> you were, Son, only who you are", speaks of the central theme of redemption. The hummingbird that Jake sees at various points in the film is a [...] "good spirit" [...] that could represent either Alice or Ella; an alternate theory is that Ella was an angel that helped Jake [...] "get over" [...] Alice.

I think he’s not a bad guy, he just gets blinded by ambition." [...] On the character's second season arc, Fazekas reiterated that he [...] "puts his ambition and his ego over other things, over sometimes doing the right thing, and he often doesn't <b>care</b> <b>who</b> gets hurt or who is upset about it ... he actually decides {{to do the right thing}} in the end at great cost to himself." ...|$|E
