Currently, many scientists are looking for new coagulants, flocculants and physicochemical methods allowing for sufficient removal of pollutants from water.

The <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> <b>oxide</b> suspension not contain-ing PAA is the most stable at pH 03. Under these conditions, each positively charged solid particle is surrounded by a negatively charged diffusion layer which protects from par-ticle collision and aggregates formation (electrostatic stabi-lization).

The objective of this investigation is to study {{the role of the}} surface oxide formed during the fretting process on the tribological behavior of this class of materials, at temperatures up to 5500 C. The investigation, which was carried out using a specially designed tribometer, showed that the wear coefficient and the coefficient of friction (COF) generally decrease with the increase of temperature at different work rates. When the work rate was fixed at relatively high value (350 mJ/s), the wear coefficient was found to decrease monotonically with temperature, while the COF experienced a peak at 2000 C. Analysis of the specimen fretted at 2000 C showed that the hard wear debris promoted abrasive wear and caused an increase in the COF. In addition, the formed oxide was thin, non-continuous and contained mainly cobalt monoxide (CoO), which contributed to the increase in the COF. Analysis of the specimen fretted at 5500 C showed that the wear damage decreased due to the formation of a continuous thick protective oxide containing mainly <b>chromium</b> (<b>III)</b> <b>oxide</b> (Cr 2 O 3), known for its good tribological characteristics.
