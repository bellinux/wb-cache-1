5|$|HSA {{formed an}} {{agreement}} with the German Focke-Wulf aircraft company to collaborate on a joint study that looked into the issue of equipping the P.1150 with two additional lift engines. However, in October 1961, West Germany elected to entirely withdraw from participation in the programme. This was a blow that was directly felt not only by HSA and the development team, but by the British Air Ministry, who had been also seeking to collaborate with its West German counterparts on the matter of VTOL aircraft. Meanwhile, further studies served to confirmed fears that the P.1150 would be too small to meet <b>customer</b> <b>specifications,</b> and thus Camm initiated work on an enlarged derivative design. In conjunction with HSA's redesign, Bristol worked to enlarge the original PCB engine and raised the exhaust heat to increase thrust to 146.8kN (30,000lbf). It could have theoretically reach speeds of up to Mach1.7–2.|$|E
25|$|Various {{avionics}} and onboard {{systems are}} integrated on the Lynx {{in order to}} perform differing mission profiles. Several operators have equipped their Lynx with BAE Systems' Sea Spray surveillance radar to provide for a surface search capability, which is used in maritime patrol, search and rescue, and other mission profiles. British Army models are equipped with a Marconi Elliot automatic flight control system capable of performing automatic three axes stabilisation. The integration of both avionics and weapons systems is customized upon each Lynx batch to <b>customer</b> <b>specifications</b> and requirements. Most of the installed sensors and avionics are typically integrated with the aircraft's avionics management system (AMS), from {{where they can be}} managed by either pilot; sensors such the optional nose-mounted FLIR can be set up to directly cue the weapon systems. Functions such as navigation and communications are also tied into the AMS, information from these systems are displayed directly to the pilots on interchangeable integrated display units in the cockpit. The Lynx is considerably easier to service and maintain than the AgustaWestland Apache.|$|E
