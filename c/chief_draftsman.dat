5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, as the <b>chief</b> <b>draftsman</b> {{of the final}} document, {{including}} the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E

2500|$|Furness's first commission, Germantown Unitarian Church (1866–67, {{demolished}} ca. 1928), was a solo effort, but in 1867, {{he formed}} {{a partnership with}} Fraser, his former teacher, and George Hewitt, who {{had worked in the}} office of John Notman. The trio lasted less than five years, and its major commissions were Rodef Shalom Synagogue (1868–69, demolished) and the Lutheran Church of the Holy Communion (1870–75, demolished). Following Fraser's move to Washington, D.C., to become supervising architect for the U.S. Treasury Department, the two younger men formed a partnership in 1871, and soon won the design competition for the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1871–76). Louis Sullivan worked briefly as a draftsman for Furness & Hewitt (June - November 1873), and his later use of organic decorative motifs can be traced, at least in part, to Furness. By the beginning of 1876, Furness had broken with Hewitt, and the firm carried only his name. [...] Hewitt and his brother William formed their own firm, G.W. & W.D. Hewitt, and became Furness's biggest competitor. In 1881, Furness promoted his <b>chief</b> <b>draftsman,</b> Allen Evans, to partner (Furness & Evans); and, in 1886, did the same for four other long-time employees. The firm continued under the name Furness, Evans & Company as late as 1932, two decades after its founder's death.|$|E

5000|$|He {{attended}} night {{courses at}} Case Institute of Technology, and learned technical drawing, design skills, and structural engineering. As the streetcar manufacturers transitioned from wooden to steel construction, his expertise {{allowed him to}} accept a better offer with Southern Car Company in High Point, North Carolina, where he became chief engineer, {{and he and his}} wife moved south in 1910. Thomas became <b>chief</b> engineer, <b>draftsman</b> and designer for the company, using both his mechanical skills and his experience as a skilled woodworker. After he was laid off there when the company folded in 1916, he was persuaded to undertake a contract to renovate streetcars for the Southern Public Utilities Company of Charlotte, North Carolina, using Southern's former facilities and many of its employees. The following year, he organized Perley A. Thomas Car Works, which became famous for its streetcars.|$|R
50|$|As Archbishop of York, Wulfstan's {{administrative}} duties were considerable. In {{addition to}} tending {{the spiritual and}} financial needs of the religious and secular communities of the North of England, he was {{deeply involved in the}} vital politics of the South. He {{was one of the most}} important members of king Æthelred II's advisory council, known as the Witan, and as such was active in all the most significant political decisions of the day. By 1008 he had secured the privilege of drafting the official royal legislation promulgated by the king and the Witan. He was deeply concerned with legislation, holding that good laws were essential if a people were to prosper. He continued as the king's <b>chief</b> legal <b>draftsman</b> on into the reign of the Danish king Cnut the Great. It is both remarkable and puzzling that Wulfstan was able to play so central a role in politics under both Æthelred's and Cnut's reigns, especially as it was under Æthelred's reign that Wulfstan, in his Sermo Lupi, so vehemently decried the depredations of the Danish and Norwegian Vikings.|$|R

5000|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Al's plans of {{attending}} the Colorado School of Mines were changed by an encounter with a Swallow biplane that flew over an area where he was working. Following the aircraft to the local airfield, Al noticed several mistakes in the aircraft rigging which he gladly offered to help fix. After rerigging the plane, which was flown by J. Don Alexander, he was offered {{a job at the}} Alexander Aircraft Company. [...] At the age of 19, Al took the job as an assistant to the <b>chief</b> engineer and <b>draftsman</b> at the Alexander Company in Denver. [...] His early years proved unfruitful with his assistance on an eventually failing design. Finally, Al got the chance to build the M-1, also known as the Long Wing Eaglerock, a plane of his own design. While the airplane had some success as a trainer, its success was not enough to keep him at the Alexander company. In 1926, after spending some time working for Montague, where he designed his M-2, Al started taking his first flying lessons. Eventually, after the financial demise of Montegue, Al returned to Alexander. [...] In 1928, he became the chief engineer at Alexander. [...] During the time as chief engineer, he was responsible for several advances in the field of aircraft design, primarily through design of the Bullet, which was a low-wing airplane with relatively high speeds and a patented retractable landing gear.|$|R

"May 2012 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The Cuban press Ediciones Vigía was founded in April of 1985 by Rolando Estévez Jordán, <b>chief</b> designer and <b>draftsman</b> of the press, and Alfredo Zaldívar, a Cuban poet. The Vigía collective of writers, artists, and volunteers have been working collaboratively since 1985 to publish handmade books that combine art, literature, and movable parts. Today, the artists and volunteers at Vigía are recognized internationally for their ability to creatively repurpose materials and craft unique, interactive works of book art that feature the work of both Cuban and non-Cuban writers and poets. In this thesis, I focus my attention on the press between 1985 and the early 2000 s. I aim to place Vigía books made during this period within historic and modern contexts to reveal how the press stands as a model for Cuban identity, and how the books published by Vigía present Cuba's cultural history as a continuum, unbroken by the Cuban Revolution of 1959. I begin by first contextualizing Vigía books within the larger framework of art history and handmade books, focusing specifically on the relationships that can be found between the Cuban books, medieval manuscripts, and Renaissance prints. Locating the Vigía books within the twentieth-century Cuban vanguardia and new art movements also provides a historical framework that informs our understanding of the society in which these books were created. Finally, a close analysis of one book, Hechizo del Vigía, within both historic and modern contexts demonstrates how Ediciones Vigía's handmade books, as I argue, serve as authentic symbols of Cuban identity...|$|R
