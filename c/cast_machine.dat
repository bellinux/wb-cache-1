The final pressure should replace the gravity feeding of the molten metal into empty spaces of the casting and inhibit the clustering of bubbles, the tablet height eliminates the air amount enclosed in casting after pressing...|$|E

We suggest that the fundamental difference between human and machine intelligence comes down to embodiment factors. We define embodiment factors as the ratio between an entity's ability to communicate information vs compute information. We speculate on the role of embodiment factors in driving our own intelligence and consciousness. We briefly review dual process models of cognition and <b>cast</b> <b>machine</b> intelligence within that framework, characterising it as a dominant System Zero, which can drive behaviour through interfacing with us subconsciously. Driven by concerns about the consequence of such a system we suggest prophylactic courses of action that could be considered.

The study results are presented showing that this method compromises {{the quality of the}} <b>cast</b> <b>machine</b> parts and of the equipment itself. Specifics of the nodularization process using the in-mold method do not provide the proper conditions for removal of chemical reaction products to the slag, i. e., the products stay in the mold cavity and they also decrease the quality of the casting. In this work, corrosion-type defects were diagnosed mostly {{on the surface of the}} casting and some compounds in the near-surface layer—i. e., fayalite (Fe 2 SiO 4) and forsterite (Mg 2 SiO 4) —which cause discontinuities in the metal matrix. The results presented here were selected based on experimental melts of ductile iron. The elements of the mold used in this study, the shape of the mixing chamber, charge materials, method of melting, temperature of liquid metal, etc. were directly related to the production conditions.

Following this fact, designers and users of machine parts made from these materials should not use them in conditions where the explosive mixtures occur...|$|E
