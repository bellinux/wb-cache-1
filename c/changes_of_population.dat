40|$|Large-scale {{exploitation}} of wild {{animals and plants}} through fishing, hunting and logging often depends on augmentation through releases of translocated or captively raised individuals. Such releases are performed worldwide in vast numbers. Augmentation can be demographically and economically beneficial but can also cause four types <b>of</b> adverse genetic <b>change</b> to wild populations: (1) loss of genetic variation, (2) loss <b>of</b> adaptations, (3) <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> composition, and (4) <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>population</b> structure. While adverse genetic impacts are recognized and documented in fisheries, little effort is devoted to actually monitoring them. In forestry and wildlife management, genetic risks associated with releases are largely neglected.

The Supreme Court has since indicated that the highest electoral imbalance permissible under Japanese law is 3:1, and that any greater imbalance between any two districts is a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. [...] In recent elections the malapportionment ratio amounted to 4.8 in the House of Councillors (census 2005: Ōsaka/Tottori; election 2007: Kanagawa/Tottori) and 2.3 in the House of Representatives (election 2009: Chiba 4/Kōchi 3).|$|E
