5|$|Since being {{founded in}} 1954, Burger King has {{undergone}} five <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> Further, during the ownership tenure of Grand Metropolitan, Grand Met merged with Guinness in 1997 {{to form a}} new company, Diageo. TPG Capital's ownership was shared with Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, both of which held minority shares. During 3G Capital's ownership, 3G divested a 29% stake of the chain to Justice Holdings of Great Britain when the chain was again taken public in 2012. When Burger King merged with Tim Hortons in 2014, Berkshire Hathaway bought into the newly combined chain as part of an debt-equity financing deal.|$|E
5|$|The {{club has}} seen its share of struggles, {{both on and off}} the ice. The team has had two <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> from Firestone to Rod Bryden in 1993 due to the arena {{development}} process and its financing, and subsequently to Eugene Melnyk after the team filed for bankruptcy in 2003. On the ice, the club finished last in the League in its first four seasons. Changes in hockey management have led to steady improvement of the team's play, resulting in the team qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 11 of the last 12 seasons, winning the Presidents' Trophy in 2002–03 and making it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2007.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a new diesel {{shunting}} locomotive, made by Thomas Hill of Rotherham was purchased. It {{was built}} at Kilnhurst, and driven along the ex-Great Central Railway line {{from there to}} the works. The first Ruston and Hornsby engine was partially dismantled, and eventually cut up in January 1978. The connection between the works and the British Rail network was cut in 1984, and the system became one of {{a very small number of}} isolated standard gauge railways. By 1986, the track layout had been simplified, and the track across Jordan bridge had been lifted. When rail operation ceased in the 1990s, one of the Hudson tipping wagons went to the National Railway Museum at Shildon, and the Thomas Hill engine, after several <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> is now located on the Peak Rail preserved railway at Matlock.|$|E

25|$|Evidently the Monkland Canal Company {{exercised}} {{the power}} to acquire the Railway Company, and with the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> of the canal itself, the Drumpeller Railway became {{the property of the}} Caledonian Railway (CR). The CR changed the track gauge to standard gauge during June 1872 in association with making a connection of the hitherto isolated line to its own network. The connection was a west-to-south curve at Bargeddie station on the Rutherglen and Coatbridge line, giving rail access from the pits.|$|E
25|$|The Arena {{was used}} by the Newcastle Cobras ice hockey team from August 1996. The Cobras were the former Durham Wasps, who had been bought by Newcastle {{businessman}} John Hall, owner of Newcastle United football club. Hall's intention was to move the team to a new venue in Newcastle near the football team's ground St James' Park, as part of his wider Sporting Club vision for the city. After failing to get planning permission, after a season spent in Sunderland still as the Wasps, the team instead moved into the newly built Arena, and began the 1996/97 season as the Cobras. Due to <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> after two years the team was renamed the Newcastle Riverkings, before again being renamed as the Newcastle Jesters. The Jesters played for a single season in 2000/01 before being shut down.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, after various <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> SodaStream {{became a}} wholly owned {{subsidiary}} of Cadbury Schweppes, although it operated as an autonomous business within the group. In 1998, SodaStream {{was bought by}} Soda-Club, an Israeli company founded in 1991 by Peter Wiseburgh, who from 1978 to 1991 had been Israel's exclusive distributor for SodaStream, creating the world's largest home carbonation systems supplier. In 2003 Soda-Club closed the SodaStream factory in Peterborough, moving the company's gas cylinder refilling and refurbishment department to Germany. Under the ownership of Soda-Club, the brand has been relaunched in many markets, with new machines and new flavours available in 41 countries. In 2012, SodaStream teamed with Yves Béhar to introduce SodaStream Source, a line of soda machines designed with a special emphasis on sustainability. Béhar's design earned SodaStream a Good Housekeeping Institute seal of approval in 2013.|$|E
25|$|CBN is {{now seen}} in 180 {{countries}} and broadcast in 71 languages. He founded the CBN Cable Network, which was renamed the CBN Family Channel in 1988 and later simply the Family Channel. When the Family Channel became too profitable for Robertson {{to keep it}} under the CBN umbrella without endangering CBN's non-profit status, he formed International Family Entertainment Inc. in 1990 with the Family Channel as its main subsidiary. Robertson sold the Family Channel to the News Corporation in 1997, which renamed it Fox Family. A condition of the sale was that the station would continue airing Robertson's television program, The 700 Club, twice a day in perpetuity, regardless of any <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership.</b> The channel is now owned by Disney and run as Freeform. On December 3, 2007, Robertson resigned as chief executive of CBN; he was succeeded by his son, Gordon.|$|E
25|$|The late 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries saw {{the demise of}} Surrey's long-standing {{industries}} manufacturing paper and gunpowder. Most of the county's paper mills closed {{in the years after}} 1870, and the last survivor shut in 1928. Gunpowder production fell victim to the First World War, which brought about a huge expansion of the British munitions industry, followed by sharp contraction and consolidation when the war ended, leading to the closure of the Surrey powder mills. New industrial developments included the establishment of the vehicle manufacturers Dennis Brothers in Guildford in 1895. Beginning as a maker of bicycles and then of cars, the firm soon shifted into the production of commercial and utility vehicles, becoming internationally important as a manufacturer of fire engines and buses. Though much reduced in size and despite multiple <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> this business continues to operate in Guildford. Kingston and nearby Ham became a centre of aircraft manufacturing, with the establishment in 1912 of the Sopwith Aviation Company and in 1920 of its successor H.G. Hawker Engineering, which later became Hawker Aviation and then Hawker Siddeley.|$|E

25|$|Although {{they were}} {{not meant to be}} seen by the public, the {{paintings}} remain important works in Goya's oeuvre. When Goya went into self-imposed exile in France in 1823, he passed Quinta del Sordo to his grandson, Mariano. After various <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> the house came into the possession of the Belgian Baron Emile d'Erlanger in 1874. After 70 years on the walls of Quinta del Sordo, the murals were deteriorating badly and, in order to preserve them, the new owner of the house had them transferred to canvas under the direction of Salvador Martínez Cubells, the chief art restorer at the Museo del Prado. After showing them at the Exposition Universelle of 1878 in Paris, d'Erlanger eventually donated them to the Spanish state. The effects of time on the murals, coupled with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the crumbling plaster on canvas, meant that most of the murals required restoration work and some detail may have been lost, but in this respect Saturn Devouring His Son appears to have fared better than some of the other works.|$|E
500|$|The Sembawang Hot Spring ( [...] ; pinyin: sanbawang wenquan), {{located at}} Gambas Avenue between Woodlands Avenue 12 and Sembawang Road, {{is the only}} natural hot spring on the main island of Singapore.

The spring is {{believed}} by locals to have healing properties, and its water has been bottled commercially by Fraser and Neave, under the brand name of Seletaris. Since its discovery in 1909, the spring, now on land belonging to a military air base, has gone through several <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and abortive redevelopment plans. The hot spring retains a rural rustic feel for nature visitors to unwind.|$|E
500|$|In 1971, Merrick sold a half-interest in Easy Jet and {{his full}} brother Jet Smooth to Joe McDermott, {{and five years}} later, in 1976, the {{partners}} sold Easy Jet to the Buena Suerte Ranch for $3.57million (approximately $ as of [...] ). Later, after two of the partners in the ranch died unexpectedly, Merrick re-purchased Easy Jet and bought a controlling share in the ranch. In 1980, the stallion was syndicated for $30million (approximately $ as of [...] ), a record amount at the time. The syndicate had 50shares, each costing $600,000 (approximately $ as of [...] ). The oil bust of the 1980s, and changes in US tax laws affecting horse operations, led to financial problems for the horse market {{in general and the}} syndicate, which led to financial difficulties for Merrick and resulted in many <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> for Easy Jet until the death of the champion in 1992.|$|E

500|$|In April 2006 Yeovil {{became the}} first town in Britain to {{institute}} a somewhat controversial system of biometric fingerprint scanning in nightclubs. Individuals wishing {{to gain access to}} one of the town's nightclubs were asked in the first instance to submit their personal details for inclusion in a central system. This included a photograph and index fingerprint. Thereafter, each entry to one of the participating premises required a fingerprint scan. The scheme is no longer in operation. According to Nigel J Marston, Licensing Manager of South Somerset District Council, the scheme was short lived as, [...] "The company that originally supplied went through various <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and the project became unsupported. This allied to several of the venues closing down lead to the death of the scheme." [...] In February 2007, Yeovil Town Council {{became the first}} English council to ban the children's craze Heelys in the centre of the town and High Street. Skateboards, roller skates and roller blades are also illegal in the area. Councilors have stated this is due to [...] "numerous complaints about the activities of youngsters".|$|E
