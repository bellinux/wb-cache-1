The electrode supported cell was operated during 6100 h under a current density of j =- 0. 75 Acm- 2 at 778 - 780 °C, the electrolyte supported cell during 2200 h under j =- 0. 5 Acm- 2 at 834 °C.

Periodically taken OCVs remained constant, i. e. there was no increase in non-ionic electrolyte conduction. Impedance spectroscopic measurements showed that the increase in the cell resistance with time was both due to increasing ohmic and reactive terms at the electrode supported cell. At the electrolyte supported cell the ohmic rise prevailed...|$|R
50|$|For this to work, {{the cell}} {{capacitance}} must {{be higher than}} the electrode capacitance by at least an order of magnitude. Capacitance slows the kinetics (the rise and fall times) of currents. If the electrode capacitance is much {{less than that of}} the cell, then when current is passed through the electrode, the electrode voltage will change faster than the <b>cell</b> <b>voltage.</b> Thus, when current is injected and then turned off (at the end of a duty cycle), the electrode voltage will decay faster than the <b>cell</b> <b>voltage.</b> As soon as the electrode voltage asymptotes to the <b>cell</b> <b>voltage,</b> the voltage can be sampled (again) and the next amount of charge applied. Thus, the frequency of the duty cycle is limited to the speed at which the electrode voltage rises and decays while passing current. The lower the electrode capacitance the faster one can cycle.|$|E

It optimizes cell timing per user-selected groups of cells and outputs timing adjustments, one for each of the selected groups. To verify the theory, we acquired and present data for both unloaded and loaded cell-timing optimizations. For the unloaded cells, the preoptimization baseline energy spread was reduced by 34 % and 31 % for two shots as compared to baseline. For the loaded-cell case, the measured energy spread was reduced by 49 % compared to baseline...|$|R
