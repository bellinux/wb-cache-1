5000|$|Doffing is a {{separate}} process. An attendant (or robot in an automated system) winds down the ring rails to the bottom. The machine stops. The thread guides are hinged up. The completed bobbin <b>coils</b> (<b>yarn</b> packages) are removed from the spindles. The new bobbin tube {{is placed on the}} spindle trapping the thread between it and the cup in the wharf of the spindle, the thread guides are lowered and the machine restarted. Now all the processes are done automatically. The yarn is taken to a cone winder. Currently, machines are manufactured by Rieter (Switzerland), ToyoTa (Japan), Zinser, Suessen, (Germany) and Marzoli (Italy). The Rieter compact K45 system, has 1632 spindles, while the ToyoTa has a machine with 1824 spindles. All require controlled atmospheric conditions.|$|R
30|$|Many {{temperature}} indicators or sensors show color {{changes for}} {{materials used in}} food and medical fields. However, they are not helpful for a color-blind person or children who lack judgment. In this paper, we introduce simply fabricated and more useful low-temperature indicator (~ 30  °C) for devices that actuates using paraffin-infiltrated multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) <b>coiled</b> <b>yarn.</b> The density difference of MWCNT yarn provides large strain (~ 330  %) when heat causes the melted polymer to move. Furthermore, the MWCNT yarn decreases the melting point of paraffin. These properties allow control of the actuating temperature. In addition, mechanical strength was enhanced by MWCNT than previously reported temperature-responsive actuators based on shape memory polymers. This simply fabricated temperature indicator can be applied in latching devices for medical and biological fields.|$|R
30|$|We also {{checked the}} tensile {{actuation}} of a paraffin-infiltrated MWCNT-coiled yarn powered by electrical heat. When the hybrid yarn {{was exposed to}} heat for 100  s at an 8  V square-wave pulse, a contraction of 3.3  % was generated at first {{for a short time}} and then steadily elongation occurred during heating (Fig.  3 f). The tensile strains of − 3.7 and − 4.2  % were obtained by applying 0.25  Hz, 6  V, and an 8  V square-wave voltage at 50  % duty cycle to lift a load that provided a 3.9  MPa stress as shown in Fig.  3 f (inset). The hybrid-coiled yarn experienced creep during the cycles and the creep constantly increased at higher applied voltage. From this experiment, the paraffin volume expanded during heating, and simultaneously, paraffin slowly flowed out and ran along the yarn when the paraffin was exposed close to its melting point. We measured the weight of paraffin-infiltrated MWCNT-coiled yarn before and after heating by oven. An average weight decrease of ~ 20.6  % occurred during heating. Such a large change in weight makes a huge volume change in the yarn, with the result of high elongation of the <b>coiled</b> <b>yarn</b> close to the melting point during heating.|$|R

30|$|The {{methods for}} making the twisted and <b>coiled</b> CNT <b>yarns</b> are like those above {{described}} for the electrochemical methods, and various methods {{can be used for}} incorporating high volume fractions of guest in these yarns. These methods include, for example, melt or solution infiltration (which can be followed by in situ polymerization) and biscrolling, in which the guest is deposited on a CNT sheet before twist insertion [2]. Use of paraffin wax as guest provides large yarn volume changes, and thereby large torsional and tensile strokes, so the experimental results described herein use this guest for hybrid yarn muscles.|$|R
50|$|Once the bobbin is full, {{the hobby}} spinner either {{puts on a}} new bobbin, or forms a skein, or balls the yarn. A skein is a <b>coil</b> of <b>yarn</b> twisted into a loose knot. Yarn is skeined using a niddy-noddy or other type of skein -winder. Yarn is rarely balled {{directly}} after spinning, it will be stored in skein form, and transferred to a ball only if needed. Knitting from a skein, is difficult as the yarn forms knots, {{in this case it}} is best to ball. Yarn to be plied is left on the bobbin.|$|R
30|$|Figure  3 c {{shows the}} tensile {{actuation}} of the paraffin-infiltrated MWCNT-coiled yarn vs exposure time at certain temperatures, with increments of 5 °C from 30 to 70  °C. Each temperature was maintained for 28  min. From these measurements, the first elongation of ~ 15  % started at ~ 30  °C, {{and the major}} elongation (over 30  % at each temperature) occurred between 35 and 45  °C. The elongation was asymptotically approached at each temperatures and almost finished at ~ 60  °C. The final tensile elongation of this sample was ~ 214  %, {{which is similar to}} that in Fig.  3 b. The applied load from 0.28 to 2.75  MPa generated tensile elongation of 109 – 330  % (Fig.  3 d). Also, the elongation starting points of temperature gradually shifted. Figure  3 e shows that the tensile actuation of paraffin-infiltrated MWCNT-coiled yarn consisted of a layer of various numbers of MWCNT sheets under the same weight (~ 5  mN) during heating. The total tensile actuation of <b>coiled</b> <b>yarns</b> twisted by four-, eight-, and twelve-layer MWCNT sheets was obtained as 180, 112, and 28  % at ~ 80  °C, respectively. The actuation starting points became faster with decreasing the number of MWCNT sheets in the layer. Tensile strain of our yarn actuator is highly related to weight percent of MWCNT because the MWCNT layer acts as barrier to prevent guest paraffin from flowing out when heated. Therefore, when less MWCNT layers, the guest paraffin flows out more easily and the yarn actuator shows higher tensile performance.|$|R
30|$|The {{reviewed}} work on twist-spun CNT artificial muscles {{demonstrates the}} extremely high torsional and tensile muscle performance {{than can be}} obtained by the use of twisted, non-coiled and twisted, <b>coiled</b> CNT <b>yarns.</b> The liquid-electrolyte-based twisted, non-coiled muscles (1) generate highly reversible torsional rotation (250 °/mm of muscle length), which is 1000 times that for prior-art muscles, as well as a 590 revolutions/minute maximum rotation rate that was maintained for 30 full rotations and (2) a gravimetric peak torsional power output similar to that of large, high-power electric motor [1]. While the demonstrated use of these muscles for microfluidic circuits might become practical, the need for an electrolyte bath and associated confinement system is problematic (especially since it dramatically increases system weight and volume).|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{describe}} methods for producing high performance CNT-based torsional and tensile artificial muscles by processes that involve inserting twist into forest-drawn CNT sheets. All of these muscles use yarn volume expansion (produced either electrochemically or by thermal expansion of a yarn guest) to reversibly generate yarn contraction and yarn untwist [1, 2]. <b>Yarn</b> <b>coiling,</b> produced by inserting high twist into the CNT yarn, dramatically amplifies tensile stroke and work capabilities {{compared with those}} for non-coiled yarn [2].|$|R
40|$|Yarn-based supercapacitors having {{improved}} performance {{are needed for}} existing and emerging wearable applications. Here, we report weavable carbon nanotube yarn supercapacitors having high performance because of high loadings of rapidly accessible charge storage particles (above 90 wt% MnO 2). The yarn electrodes are made by a biscrolling process that traps host MnO 2 nanoparticles within the galleries of helically scrolled carbon nanotube sheets, which provide strength and electrical conductivity. Despite the high loading of brittle metal oxide particles, the biscrolled solid-state yarn supercapacitors are flexible and can be made elastically stretchable (up to 30 % strain) by over-twisting to produce <b>yarn</b> <b>coiling.</b> The maximum areal capacitance of the yarn electrodes were up to 100 times higher than for previously reported fibres or yarn supercapacitors.

All-solid-state torsional electrochemical yarn muscles have provided a large torsional muscle stroke (53 ° per mm of yarn length) and a tensile stroke of up to 1.3 % when lifting loads that are ~ 25 times heavier than can be lifted by the same diameter human skeletal muscle. Over a million torsional and tensile actuation cycles have been demonstrated for thermally powered CNT hybrid yarns muscles filled with paraffin wax, wherein a muscle spins a rotor at an average 11, 500 revolutions/minute or delivers 3 % tensile contraction at 1200  cycles/minute. At lower actuation rates, these thermally powered muscles provide tensile strokes of over 10 %.|$|R
