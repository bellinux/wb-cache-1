She left {{most of her}} estate, {{estimated}} at $3.5 million and also including her Manhattan apartment and Bellerive, to a long-time friend, Helen O'Hagan, a retired director of <b>corporate</b> <b>relations</b> at Saks Fifth Avenue. Colbert had met O'Hagan in 1961 {{on the set of}} Parrish, her last film, and the pair became best friends around 1970.

[...] Though O'Hagan was financially comfortable without the generous bequest, Bellerive was sold for over $2 million to David Geffen. Colbert's remaining assets were distributed among three heirs: $150,000 to her niece Coco Lewis; a trust worth more than $100,000 to UCLA for Pressman’s memory; and $75,000 to Marie Corbin, Colbert's Barbadian housekeeper.|$|E
