40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{experimental}} {{study was to determine}} whether the university student in an experimental group which does teacher-guided revision and rewriting of an essay achieves greater skill in later composition performance than the student in a control group which corrects an essay's mechanical and grammatical errors {{with the aid of a}} handbook and does not revise nor rewrite. This research was designed to answer the following questions: 1. To what extent will students who are taught to revise and rewrite become editors? 2. To what extent will students who are taught to revise and rewrite become accurate proofreaders? 3. To what extent will students who are taught to revise and rewrite improve their composition skills in both the areas of editing and proofreading?The subjects of this research experiment were students enrolled in freshman composition at a state university. The twenty-six students in the control group and the twenty-five students in the experimental group were found to be comparable in educational background, age, race, sex, class standing, future career choices, and English ability. The control and experimental groups were taught alike with the exception of the lessons dealing with revision and rewriting. During these lessons members of the experimental group did teacher-guided revision of their corrected themes and were taught to makerevision a process of editing rather than just proofreading. In contrast, members of the. control group were asked to make an out-of-class <b>correction</b> <b>sheet</b> of only the mechanical and grammatical errors in each of their themes; they were not asked to revise themes 1, 3, 5, and 7, but rather wrote themes 2, 4, a process of proofreading. Both groups discussed revision, even though only the experimental group did an actual revision. In order to measure the results of this experiment, compositions written by the experimental and control classes at the beginning and end of the experiment were analyzed. The compositions were coded, mixed, and scored by four evaluators using an eight-category essay evaluation form and working independently of each other. After individual gains were tabulated for each student, the mean of each groups' gains was found for each of the three sections of the essay evaluation form: proofreading, editing, and total composition. The t-test was then applied to the three sets of means to determine the significance of the difference between them. It was found that there was no significant difference. However, since both groups had made gains between their beginning and end-of-term essays, the t-test for the hypothesized value of a single mean was then applied to the three sets of means. The gains made by both groups in each of the areas were significant at the. 001 level. The main conclusion of this study was that there is no assurance that a student who writes four themes and revises and rewrites each into a new theme will improve his composition 6, and 8 on four new topics. They were taught to make revision skills any more than one who writes eight themes on eight different topics and makes a <b>correction</b> <b>sheet</b> for each [...] at least if each group is taught to revise and rewrite. Another conclusion of the study was that editing skills evidently are learned in some way other than through revising and rewriting. The conclusions implied that after teaching the steps necessary for revision, a teacher can assign an out-of-class <b>correction</b> <b>sheet</b> rather than have students do a complete revision in class. Another implication was that if students discuss revision techniques, and then either make a <b>correction</b> <b>sheet</b> or do a complete revision, rewriting is not necessary. It seemed possible that further research might show that if students discuss revision techniques and perceive their problems, they may not need to make a <b>correction</b> <b>sheet</b> or an actual revision. If comprehension of revision is achieved, the actual writing out of what they have comprehended may be irrelevant. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E

40|$|We enumerate the {{singular}} algebraic curves {{in a complete}} linear system on a smooth projective surface. The system must be suitably ample in a rather precise sense. The curves may have up to eight nodes, or a triple point of a given type and up to three nodes. The curves must also pass through appropriately many general points. The number of curves is given by a universal polynomial in four basic Chern numbers. To justify the enumeration, we make a rudimentary classification {{of the types of}} singularities using Enriques diagrams, obtaining results like Arnold's. We show that the curves in question do, in fact, appear with multiplicity 1 using the versal deformation space, Shustin's codimension formula, and Gotzmann's regularity theorem. Finally, we relate our work to Vainsencher's work with up to seven nodes. Comment: [...] 31 pa ges, AMSTeX: revised version of the published article with minor corrections and updated references.

In the first approach the flow {{is represented by}} point vortices, {{and in the second}} it is simulated as the evolution of a continuous vortex sheet composed of short linear elements or ''panels''. The comparison is based on fresh simulations using approximately the same number of elements in either model, paying due attention in both to the boundary conditions far downstream as well as those on the splitter plate from which the mixing layer issues. The comparisons show that, while both models satisfy the well-known invariants of vortex dynamics approximately to the same accuracy, the vortex panel model, although ultimately not convergent, leads to smoother roll-up and values of stresses and moments that are in closer agreement with the experiment, and has a higher computational efficiency for a given degree of convergence on moments.

40|$|Purpose: In {{this work}} {{we present a}} dual-phase {{diffusion}} tensor imaging (DTI) technique that incorporates a correction scheme for the cardiac material strain, based on 3 D myocardial tagging. Methods: In vivo dual-phase cardiac DTI with a stimulated echo approach and 3 D tagging was performed in 10 healthy volunteers. The time course of material strain was estimated from the tagging data and used to correct for strain effects in the diffusion weighted acquisition. Mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, helix, transverse and sheet angles were calculated and compared between systole and diastole, with and without strain correction. Data acquired at the systolic sweet spot, where the effects of strain are eliminated, served as a reference. Results: The impact of strain correction on helix angle was small. However, large differences were observed in the transverse and sheet angle values, with and without strain correction. The standard deviation of systolic transverse angles was significantly reduced from 35. 9 ± 3. 9 ° to 27. 8 °± 3. 5 ° (p< 0. 001) upon strain-correction indicating more coherent fiber tracks after correction. Myocyte aggregate structure was aligned more longitudinally in systole compared to diastole as reflected by an increased transmural range of helix angles (71. 8 °± 3. 9 ° systole vs. 55. 6 °± 5. 6 °, p< 0. 001 diastole). While diastolic sheet angle histograms had dominant counts at high sheet angle values, systolic histograms showed lower sheet angle values indicating a reorientation of myocyte sheets during contraction.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{relationships}} {{of the variables}} of a process to be controlled are expressed in a mathematical model of the process. In {{the case of the}} rolling of metal the process is described by the physics of the deformation of the metal in the roll gap. In developing the theory of rolling it is necessary to survey the field for existing theories and decide upon the theory that most nearly describes the process. The final model is in a form which shows the relationship of manipulated variables to measurable variables. The control of rolling is done by a machine, or rolling mill. From a control point of view it is necessary to study the combined behavior of machine and metal deformation to find the variables that may be used to most effectively regulate the process. A typical problem in this area is to control the output thickness to a given deviation from nominal. The machine-process equations show that output thickness is controlled readily by strip tensions and rolling speed. The mathematical model also shows which variables most effectively control the thickness and what the relationships are between changes in controlled variables and <b>correction</b> in output <b>sheet</b> thickness. Since the control of the process is the object of the investigation, the controller must be capable of working into conventional rolling mill drive equipment.

40|$|This practitioner’s {{essay was}} {{published}} in Visual Communication, an international peer-reviewed journal. It sets {{out to make a}} contribution to the field of pedagogy and drawing by testing in a series of drawing experiments what it is possible to learn about the form and content of a drawing by redrawing it. The essay explores the value of transcription as a means of learning to make and 'read' drawings. It tracks Farthing’s twenty-five interrogative transcriptions from the charcoal drawing 'Man Reading a Newspaper' made in 1950 by the modernist painter Jean Hélion. The research that enabled this essay began in 2006, when the author was Principal Investigator in ‘Drawing from Turner’ a collaborative project situated in Tate Britain‘s print room funded by the Rootstein Hopkins foundation and Tate Gallery. This project explored the value of transcription in teaching and learning, and was published by Tate Britain in 2006 as an exhibition (and at [URL] britain/exhibition/drawing-turner/drawing-turner-drawings). On 5 May 1950, when he was 46 years old, Jean Helion, son of a dressmaker and a taxi driver, made a drawing from life of a man reading a newspaper. He made the drawing in just a few minutes, with charcoal, without <b>corrections,</b> on a <b>sheet</b> of cartridge paper, 22 " × 32 ". When in June 2007 I showed the drawing to an artist friend, he said the newspaper that is central to the image looked like it was drawn by Frank Gehry. This observation and a recent experience of working on a research project that tested the value of making transcriptions as a means of both better understanding individual drawings and more generally learning how to draw got me thinking anew about Helion’s drawing. The research question underpinning the original Drawing from Turner project – Could the making of transcriptions from the drawings of high achievers have a part to play in developing a curriculum for learning to draw today? – clearly remained relevant but more important now was the specific question: What can you learn about a drawing by redrawing it? So the project On Drawing a Man Reading a Newspaper was born. It clearly relates to the Turner project, but this time focuses on just one modernist drawing and on discovering what can be learned by not just redrawing a drawing once but by redrawing it over and over again...|$|R

Para tanto, aplicou-se ??s demonstra????es financeiras das empresas brasileiras do subsetor de ???siderurgia e metalurgia??? listadas na BM&FBOVESPA, no per??odo de 2009 a 2014, a sistem??tica de corre????o monet??ria de balan??os (CMB). Foram calculados ??ndices de comparabilidade entre diferentes empresas e entre per??odos da mesma empresa tanto a valores hist??ricos quanto a valores monetariamente corrigidos, considerando-se as vari??veis lucro l??quido, retorno sobre o patrim??nio l??quido (ROE) e valor econ??mico agregado (EVA??), importantes indicadores de {{performance}} utilizados pelos investidores enquanto usu??rios da informa????o. Formularam-se hip??teses para cada uma destas vari??veis buscando-se verificar a exist??ncia de diferen??as de comparabilidade entre as informa????es corrigidas e as informa????es hist??ricas. Estas hip??teses foram testadas por meio da aplica????o do teste t de Student, pressupondo-se como hip??tese nula a igualdade entre os ??ndices de comparabilidade corrigidos e os ??ndices hist??ricos, cabendo ao teste indicar sua aceita????o ou rejei????o. Ademais, foram calculadas e analisadas as varia????es percentuais entre os ??ndices de comparabilidade com os efeitos inflacion??rios e os ??ndices isentos destes efeitos. Os resultados dos testes de hip??teses evidenciaram diferen??as de comparabilidade entre empresas para todas as vari??veis. J?? os resultados dos testes relativos ao eixo temporal apontaram diferen??as de comparabilidade para a vari??vel ROE, n??o havendo evid??ncia estat??stica de diferen??as na comparabilidade entre per??odos para o lucro l??quido e EVA??. No entanto, as varia????es percentuais dos ??ndices corrigidos de comparabilidade temporal em rela????o aos ??ndices hist??ricos para estas vari??veis revelaram impactos relevantes para parte das empresas, os quais n??o devem ser desprezados. Os achados da pesquisa corroboram com a import??ncia da corre????o monet??ria das demonstra????es financeiras. This {{research has}} provided {{a discussion about the}} impacts on qualitative characteristics of comparability of information resulting from the lack of monetary correction of financial statements in the current Brazilian economic scenario. In face of that, the monetary <b>correction</b> of balance <b>sheet</b> was applied in the financial statements of Brazilian companies included in the subsector of steel and metallurgy that are listed on BM&FBOVESPA, from 2009 to 2014. It was calculated the comparability ratio between different companies and between different periods of the same company both at historical values and at adjusted for inflation values, considering the net profit, return on equity (ROE) and the economic value added (EVA??), which are important performance ratio used by investors as users of accounting information. Hypotheses were made for each variable in order to verify the differences of comparability between the adjusted information and the historical information. Those hypotheses were tested through the application of Student???s T-test, assuming as the null hypothesis the equality between the comparability of adjusted ratio and historical ratio, so the test???s role is indicate its acceptance or rejection. Moreover, it was calculated and analysed the percentage change between the comparability ratio considering inflationary effects and the comparability ratio without those effects. The results of hypothesis tests have shown comparability between different companies for all variables. In another hand, the results of the time axis tests have shown comparable differences for the ROE, with no statistical evidence of differences in comparability between periods for net income and for EVA??. However, the percentage change of the adjusted ratio of temporal comparability compared to historical ratio for those variables has shown significant impacts on the companies, which should not be neglected. This discovery corroborates the importance of the monetary correction of financial statements...|$|R
