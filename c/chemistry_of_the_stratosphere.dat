40|$|A {{number of}} key {{problems}} in atmospheric chemistry are shaped by the strength and character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various mechanisms acting to move and mix air in the upper troposphere. These transport processes are examined from a mechanistic perspective, with primary emphasis on the tropopause and middle-troposphere regions in the extratropics. <b>The</b> roles <b>of</b> vertical and horizontal transport “barriers ” are explored, including the processes by which such barriers are created and are overcome. These transport considerations lead to a hypothesis concerning the processes that shape the tropopause itself. Some perspectives are offered on the still immature subject <b>of</b> transport in <b>the</b> upper troposphere <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tropics. The upper troposphere is a transition zone separating <b>the</b> distinctly different <b>chemistries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere</b> from those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower troposphere. This region exchanges air with <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere</b> and <b>the</b> lower troposphere through various atmospheric transport processes. <b>The</b> differing efficiencies <b>of</b> these transport processes determine, to a significant degree, <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photochemical processes that occur there. <b>The</b> effects <b>of</b> anthropogenic influences on ozone and aerosol concentrations in the upper troposphere are of current interest because of their potential contributions to climate change. For example, observed sharp ozone losses in <b>the</b> lower <b>stratosphere</b> can influence chemical and climate changes in the upper troposphere by means <b>of</b> transport across <b>the</b> tropopause. Groundlevel anthropogenic sources of nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons could play a substantial chemical role in changing the ozone concentrations in the upper troposphere.

Three years (1978 - 1980) of this simulation were averaged to form a monthly, zonal-mean ozone distribution {{that was used in}} the 20 -year integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FVGCM for "unperturbed" conditions. The second 20 -year GCM integration included a fully-developed ozone hole. This ozone distribution was from three years, 1998 - 2000, from the same CTM simulation. <b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> this work is to determine <b>the</b> coupled response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chemistry</b> and dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stratosphere.</b> These experiments are the first step in understanding the coupled response. An important initial question concerns <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signals: if 20 -year integrations turn out to be too short, the runs will be extended...|$|R
