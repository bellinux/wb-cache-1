40|$|A {{series of}} scaling studies {{attempting}} to correlate the H(high) -mode power threshold (P{sub TH}) with global parameters have been conducted. Data from these discharges {{is also being}} used to look for dependence of P{sub TH} on local edge parameters and to test theories of the transition. Boronization and better operational techniques have resulted in lower power thresholds and weaker density scaling. Neon impurity injection experiments show that radiation also {{plays a role in}} determining P{sub TH}. A low density threshold for the L(low) -H(high) transition has been linked with the locked mode low density limit, and can be reduced with the use of an error field <b>correcting</b> <b>coil.</b> Highly developed edge diagnostics, with spatial resolution as low as 5 mm, are used to evaluate how the power threshold depends on local edge conditions. Preliminary analysis of local edge conditions for parameter scans of n{sub e}, B{sub T}, and I{sub p} in single-null discharges, and the X-point imbalance in double-null discharges-show that, just before the transition to H-mode, the edge temperatures near the separatrix are approximately constant at 100 < T{sub i} < 220 eV and 35 < T{sub e} < 130 eV, even though the threshold power varied from 1. 5 to 14 MW. During a density scan, the edge ion collisionality, v{sub *i}, varied from 2 to 17, demonstrating that a transition condition as simple as v{sub *i} = constant is inconsistent with the data. The local edge parameters of n{sub e}, T{sub e}, and T{sub i} do not always follow the same global scaling as P{sub TH}. Therefore, theories of the L-H transition need not be constrained by these scalings...|$|E

A realistic interventional neuroradiology simulator would provide procedural and skill training for either educational purpose or pre-therapeutic simulation in complex cases. This work aims at evaluating the clinical realism of a computer-based simulator for the EVT of aneurysms. Material and Methods: A prototype computer-based EVT simulation system was developed and implemented. A silicon vascular phantom (Elastrat, Geneva, Switzerland) {{as well as two}} patient data sets were used for the evaluation. A coil adapted to the aneurysm was deployed under fluoroscopy. Then, a simulation was done with the same, as well as larger and smaller coils under the same viewing incidence and was visually assessed and compared to fluoroscopic images. The maximum of coil pressure onto the aneurysm sac was recorded during all simulations. Results: In all cases, simulation with the <b>correct</b> <b>coil</b> showed a realistic coil behaviour and aneurysm filling.

Metabolite resonances {{were evaluated by}} metabolic ratios and absolutely by <b>correcting</b> for <b>coil</b> load and comparison to phantom measurements. Metabolic images were created to visualize the metabolic changes. All patients showed spectra that were different from those measured in healthy control subjects. Spectral changes were also present in normal-appearing matter (NAM) that was distant from lesions. The resonance at 3. 55 ppm which is usually assigned to both myo-inositol and glycine, {{was the only one}} to allow a discrimination between healthy volunteers, astrocytoma grade II, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (p > 0. 02). From the different echo times used we conclude that an increase in this resonance has to be assigned to glycine rather than myo-inositol. This resonance might be used to grade human gliomas more reliably. Total creatine (Cr) decreased more drastically with malignancy than N-acetylated metabolites (NA). This led to a higher NA/Cr ratio in GBM compared to astrocytoma grade II. NA/Cr was thus pseudonormal in GBM due to a change in both nominator and denominator. This study reveals the importance of comparing magnetic resonance spectroscopy data of lesions to spectra measured in identical localizations in healthy control subjects instead of NAM and the importance of quantifying single metabolic peaks instead of creating metabolic ratios in clinical magnetic resonance spectroscopy...|$|R

Methods Eleven PAD patients with claudication (ankle-brachial index 0. 67 ± 0. 14) and 16 age-matched NL underwent symptom-limited CE-MRI using a pedal ergometer. Tissue perfusion and arterial input were measured at rest and peak exercise after injection of 0. 1 mM/kg of gadolinium-diethylnetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). Tissue function (TF) and arterial input function (AIF) measurements were made from the slope of time-intensity curves in muscle and artery, respectively, and normalized to proton density signal to <b>correct</b> for <b>coil</b> inhomogeneity. Perfusion index (PI) [*]=[*]TF/AIF. Perfusion reserve (PR) [*]=[*]exercise TF/ rest TF. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated from 11 NL and 10 PAD with repeated MRI on a different day. Results Resting TF was low in NL and PAD (mean[*]±[*]SD 0. 25 [*]±[*] 0. 18 vs 0. 35 [*]±[*] 0. 71, p[*]=[*] 0. 59) but reproducible (ICC 0. 76). Exercise TF was higher in NL than PAD (5. 5 [*]±[*] 3. 2 vs. 3. 4 [*]±[*] 1. 6, p[*]=[*] 0. 04). Perfusion reserve was similar between groups and highly variable (28. 6 [*]±[*] 19. 8 vs. 42. 6 [*]±[*] 41. 0, p[*]=[*] 0. 26). Exercise TF and PI were reproducible measures (ICC 0. 63 and 0. 60, respectively). Conclusion Although rest measures are reproducible, they are quite low, do not distinguish NL from PAD, and lead to variability in perfusion reserve measures. Exercise TF and PI are the most reproducible MRI perfusion measures in PAD for use in clinical trials. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the case}} of the hyperpolarized gas imaging of the lungs, a cost {{effective}} vest-coil (to be described in detail in the Hyperpolarized Gas section) is used. Normally this coil geometry gives nearly ideal coil sensitivity. However, not all patients are of similar sizes, and therefore when imaging larger patients, the vest coil does not completely circumscribe the patient. This leads to severe non-uniformities in the sensitivity profile near the open section of the vest coil, following the 1 /r 2 principle of coil sensitivity. This, in turn, leads to significant attenuation of the MR signal from the affected portion of the lung volume. The goal of this project is to correct the inhomogeneities using only the acquired scan. This would allow complete backwards compatibility with all previous scans, and allow the process to work without requiring any additional use of the rather expensive 3 He gas.

40|$|Abstract. A {{critical}} point for optimization of the inductive coil design {{that can be}} applied to the cleaner rheological forming (CRF) process is to verify the <b>correct</b> relationship between <b>coil</b> length and billet length. Multi-power induction heating (with rapid change of the power) inevitably involves the existence of a temperature gradient between the billet periphery (over-heated) and core. It is indispensable to adopt a power-time heating pattern for the complete melting of eutectic at the core with limited overheating at the periphery. Typically, high power is used for the rapid reheating of the billet to the eutectic temperature range (approximately 10 ℃ lower than eutectic temperature) and low power for the remelting of the desired liquid fraction and for the radial homogenization of the liquid fraction. So, in the present study, the optimal induction coil of the multi-power induction heating system (for cleaner rheological forming, 60 Hz) to achieve the globular microstructure for a variety of the cleaner rheological material was designed and manufactured. The current contribution focuses on the influences of the multi-power induction heating parameters (power variation per each step, reheating time, and holding temperature per each step) of rheological ALTHIX 86 S materials (similar to the compositions of ASTM A 319) on the resulting microstructure with an appropriate control of the grain size.

Therefore, structures in different oligomeric states are barely distinguishable, and it is very challenging to find <b>correct</b> alignment in <b>coil</b> regions.

In this approach, we build the alignment based on not only structural coordinate information but also realistic environmental information extracted from biological unit files provided by the Protein Data Bank (PDB). At first, we eliminate all environmentally unfavorable pairings of residues. Then we identify alignments in core regions via a maximal clique finding algorithm. Two extreme value distribution (EVD) form statistics have been developed to evaluate core region alignments. With an optional extension step, global alignment can be derived based on environment-based dynamic programming linking. We show that our method is able to differentiate three-dimensional structures in different oligomeric states, and is able to find flexible alignments between multidomain structures without predetermined hinge regions. The overall performance is also evaluated on a large scale by comparisons to current structural classification databases as well as to other alignment methods...|$|R

Furthermore, spatial misregistration of this RF coil to its µ-map was simulated by shifting the µ-map in different directions and the effect on PET quantification was evaluated. Measurements of a PET NEMA standard emission phantom were performed on an integrated hybrid PET/MR system. Various CT parameters were used to calculate different µ-maps for the flexible RF coil and to evaluate the impact on the PET activity concentration. A 511 keV transmission scan of the local RF coil was used as standard of reference to adapt the slope of the conversion from HUs to LACs at 511 keV. The average underestimation of the PET activity concentration due to the non-attenuation <b>corrected</b> RF <b>coil</b> in place was calculated to be 5. 0 % in the overall phantom. When considering attenuation only in the upper volume of the phantom, the average difference to the reference scan without RF coil is 11. 0 %. When the PET/CT conversion is applied, an average overestimation of 3. 1 % (without extended CT scale) and 4. 2 % (with extended CT scale) is observed in the top volume of the NEMA phantom. Using the adapted conversion resulting from this study, the deviation in the top volume of the phantom is reduced to − 0. 5 % and shows the lowest standard deviation inside the phantom in comparison to all other conversions. Simulation of a µ-map misregistration shows acceptable results for shifts below 5 mm for the flexible surface RF coil. The adapted conversion from HUs to LAC at 511 keV within this study can improve hardware component AC in PET/MR hybrid imaging as shown for a flexible RF surface coil. Furthermore, these results have a direct impact on the improvement of the hardware component AC of the examined flexible RF coil in conjunction with position determination...|$|R
40|$|Predicting the {{secondary}} structure of proteins {{is important in}} biochemistry because the 3 D structure can be determined from the local folds that are found in secondary structures. Moreover, knowing the tertiary structure of proteins can assist in determining their functions. The objective of this thesis is to compare the performance of Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in predicting {{the secondary}} structure of 62 globular proteins from their primary sequence. For each NN and SVM, we created six binary classifiers {{to distinguish between the}} classes’ helices (H) strand (E), and coil (C). For NN we use Resilient Backpropagation training with and without early stopping. We use NN with either no hidden layer or with one hidden layer with 1, 2, [...] ., 40 hidden neurons. For SVM we use a Gaussian kernel with parameter fixed at = 0. 1 and varying cost parameters C in the range [0. 1, 5]. 10 - fold cross-validation is used to obtain overall estimates for the probability of making a correct prediction. Our experiments indicate for NN and SVM that the different binary classifiers have varying accuracies: from 69 % <b>correct</b> predictions for <b>coils</b> vs. non-coil up to 80 % correct predictions for stand vs. non-strand. It is further demonstrated that NN with no hidden layer or not more than 2 hidden neurons in the hidden layer are sufficient for better predictions. For SVM we show that the estimated accuracies do not depend on the value of the cost parameter. As a major result, we will demonstrate that the accuracy estimates of NN and SVM binary classifiers cannot distinguish. This contradicts a modern belief in bioinformatics that SVM outperforms other predictors...|$|R

40|$|Myoglobin (Mb) is a {{centrally}} important, widely studied mammalian protein. While {{much work}} has investigated multi-step unfolding of apoMb using acid or denaturant, holomyoglobin unfolding is poorly understood despite its biological relevance. We present here the first systematic unfolding simulations of holoMb {{and the first}} comparative study of unfolding of protein orthologs from different species (sperm whale, pig, horse, and harbor seal). We also provide new interpretations of experimental mean molecular ellipticities of myoglobin intermediates, notably <b>correcting</b> for random <b>coil</b> and number of helices in intermediates. The simulated holoproteins at 310 K displayed structures and dynamics in agreement with crystal structures (R g ~ 1. 48 - 1. 51 nm, helicity ~ 75 %). At 400 K, heme was not lost, but some helix loss was observed in pig and horse, suggesting that these helices are less stable in terrestrial species. At 500 K, heme was lost within 1. 0 - 3. 7 ns. All four proteins displayed exponentially decaying helix structure within 20 ns. The C- and F-helices were lost quickly in all cases. Heme delayed helix loss, and sperm whale myoglobin exhibited highest retention of heme and D/E helices. Persistence of conformation (RMSD), secondary structure, and ellipticity between 2 - 11 ns was interpreted as intermediates of holoMb unfolding in all four species. The intermediates resemble those of apoMb notably in A and H helices, but differ substantially in the D-, E- and F-helices, which interact with heme. The identified mechanisms cast light {{on the role of}} metal/cofactor in poorly understood holoMb unfolding. We also observed β-sheet formation of several myoglobins at 500 K as seen experimentally, occurring after disruption of helices to a partially unfolded, globally disordered state; heme reduced this tendency and sperm-whale did not display any sheet propensity during the simulations...|$|R
40|$|The Master thesis was {{original}} {{intended to}} {{be an attempt to}} make a direct competitive product to today s workout equipment using magnetic resistance. Since the resistance will be controlled digital, the option of making MagnetGym a closed circuit with inputs from the muscles was uttered. The thesis was then extended with biofeedback resistance control. With biofeedback, from EMGs sensors, the hypothesis was that the exact percentage of muscle activation, and therefore the percentage of force a person can generate, can be measured. This indulging the MagnetGym into today s ranks of smart products. The thesis focus will be on product development, dividing MagnetGym into sections and give proof of concept to each section. MagnetGym was divided into resistance, EMG and controls. Controls was divided into three subcategories; resistance regulator, resistance control, and resistance selection. Throughout the work period restrictions occurred, with limited budget and knowledge the end product ended up being not as in depth as hoped. Each section was evaluated to find the best solution, to solve the problems that ended in prototypes that were tested. The resistance will be generated by solenoids where the core will be moved. The resistance regulator will be done by PWM to control the amount of power traveling through the coil. The resistance control, which supervise that the resistance is correct, is a load cell between the user and the resistance. Resistance selection was in this thesis done by a LCD ad-on with buttons for the microcontroller Arduino, which will connect the MagnetGym together making it a closed circuit. The MagnetGym was connected to the body with EMG, also an ad-on for Arduino. The proof of concept went fine, however the final prototype would not work. Because of the budget and knowledge restrictions an optimal prototype with <b>correct</b> components and <b>coils</b> was not accomplished. The prototype was made with alternative components that would give proof of concept, no more. The MagnetGym is a mediocre idea that probably will not be competitive with traditional and already existing gym equipment according to this thesis. The coil will generate a lot of heat, which means cooling is needed. This will make the gym equipment more high maintenance than necessary resulting in a less cost efficient gym equipment. However the EMG idea can be the future of training, the tests and theory shows that the interpretation will be difficult task to overcome, but with further experiments there is hope...|$|R
