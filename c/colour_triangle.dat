40|$|There {{has been}} offered to use the {{non-linear}} transformations of standard colour diagram to select the discrete colours of television systems for the first time. The offered study technique showed that the non-linear transformations allow to obtain the equicontrast diagram with rather uniform field which is applicable for stated problem. The study of transformed colour field to be played back by television system showed that area corresponding the <b>colour</b> <b>triangle</b> is in its central part and exhibits the better uniformity; it offers scope for exact calculations. The transformation of coordinates of standard diagram and the calculated coordinate grid with small step allows to go from the equicontrast diagram to the standard one and to calculate exactly the discrete video signals. The method, which was basel on the optimization of zone of discrete colours to be played back, which allows to calculate the colour distinctions with equal colour differences, has been developed. The expressions to calculate the video signals of output devices have been obtainedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in six villages in three mandals viz., Tadikonda, Medikonduru and Pedanandipadu in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. All the 150 chilli farmers participating in Crop Life India (CLI) sponsored safe use of pesticides and Integrated Pest Management project were taken as sample for the study. It was expressed all the respondent farmers purchasing pesticides from authorised dealers. It was observed from the responses that all the respondents used face/nose mask and about 80 per cent used head dress. No one used hand gloves and shoes. It {{is interesting to note}} that no one used recommended personal protection equipment. Recommended personal protection equipments (PPEs) were not used by the farmers but expressed strong desire to use them if available at affordable cost and fit to local environment. Regarding the disposal empty pesticide containers 50 per cent of them bury these in the field and rest are either buried or crushed and thrown in the field. Re-use of empty pesticide bottles was not in practice. About 80 per cent of the respondents used Taiwan sprayers. About 82 per cent of the respondents took bath and 74 per cent changed clothes after spraying pesticide and 82. 67 per cent were aware of the <b>colour</b> <b>triangle</b> indication on the pesticide bottles. About 53. 33 per cent expressed that they have knowledge on upkeep of the sprayers...|$|E
50|$|After the {{development}} of the CIE system, color triangles were used as chromaticity diagrams, including briefly with the trilinear coordinates representing the chromaticity values. Since the sum of the three chromaticity values has a fixed value, it suffices to depict only two of the three values, using Cartesian co-ordinates. In the modern x,y diagram, the large triangle bounded by the imaginary primaries X, Y, and Z has corners (1,0), (0,1), and (0,0), respectively; <b>colour</b> <b>triangles</b> with real primaries are often shown within this space.|$|R

Fourier techniques {{are used to}} characterise the sequences that count walks of length n on both these families of graphs. In {{the case of the}} cyclic graph, we show that these sequences are associated to an induced <b>colouring</b> of Pascal's <b>triangle.</b> This extends previous results concerning the Jacobsthal numbers...|$|R

The beauty of the old ship is in stark contrast to the dirty blackened tugboat with its tall smokestack, which scurries across the still surface of the river.|$|R
40|$|Robots are {{developed}} {{to carry out}} certain task to help the human beings. A robot carrying out a particular needed task has promising applications {{for the betterment of}} human society. So the control of their motion remains a vital part for a robot. In this project, I have to develop the simulation of mobile agents (robots) in an arena of obstacles from a start point to a destination point without collision. So in a way this project deals with successful navigation of robots in prior known environment. This document presents a computer vision method and related algorithms for the navigation of a robot in a static environment. Our environment is a simple white coloured area with coloured obstacles (circle with white colour, rectangles with orange <b>colour,</b> <b>triangle</b> with green colour and hexagon with pink colour which helps in identifying the obstacle) and robot is in a rectangular form. The agents starting point is in blue colour and the destination point is in red colour. This environment is input by the user with the starting point and the destination point. The data acquired from here is then used as an input for the program which controls the robot drive motion in graphic control window. Robot then tries to reach its destination avoiding obstacles in its path. The algorithm presented in this paper uses the distance transform methodology to generate paths for the robot to execute which are written in C++ compiler. These paper developments can also be applied to vehicles for collision free driving. ...|$|E
40|$|The Amish {{religious}} movement {{have its}} roots in the Protestant Reformation in the 16 th century. The Amish people are anabaptists and have strict rules for their way of life. They were persecuted in Europe and Amish groups emigrated to Pennsylvania. Today the most traditional part of the movement – the Old Amish People – lives in Lancaster County west of Philadelphia, USA. This paper describs a study of the colours in Old Amish Quilts, traditional Amish patchwork quilts used as bed covers. The patches are single-coloured fabric pieces forming clear symmetrical patterns with deep and strong colours. The quilts are important in Amish culture; they are made for the bride’s wedding chest. Nowadays traditional Amish quilts also are made for turists as wall decorations – “wallhangings”. The selection of quilts for my survey consists of five Old Amish Quilts from Lancaster Heritage Museum and The American Quilt Study Group, 15 quilts, at that time, belonging to The Esprit Collection and eight new quilts with traditional patterns (wallhangings). The colour analysis was carried out using Natural Colour System (NCS) with the aim of identifying general principles for selection of colours. The analysis shows that most hues are located in {{the lower part of the}} colour circle ・from red (R) to green (G), and most nuances - with relatively high degree of blackness or chromaticness - in the lower part of the <b>colour</b> <b>triangle.</b> Colour choice is often dependent on moral or religious preferences. For example, in quilts from Lancaster County, yellowish colours are - as representing ・hochmut・ (arrogance) - regarded as bad colour choice. The strong colours in Old Amish Quilts have no counterpart in public life. In Lancaster county Amish people wear black, brown and dark blue clothes and their wagons are black; colourfulness is restricted to the bedrooms and the private sphere...|$|E

5000|$|Aircraft {{position}} was recorded {{along with the}} <b>colour</b> of the <b>triangle</b> beneath the minute hand {{at the time of}} sighting. This was reported to sector headquarters, where counters of the relayed colour were used to represent each air raid on a large table with a map of the UK overlaid with a British Modified Grid. As the plots of the raiding aircraft moved, the counters were pushed across the map by magnetic [...] "rakes". This system enabled [...] "Fighter Controllers" [...] to see very quickly where each formation was heading and allowed an estimate to be made of possible targets. The age of the information was readily apparent from the colour of the counter. Because of the simplicity of the system, decisions could be made quickly and easily.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen its spatial {{frequency}} is high enough, {{a grid of}} grey horizontal strips presented on a coloured background may change its neutral colour. It was found that some background colours induce a strong illusion and some no illusion at all. The effect of the background colour on the illusion was studied for the spatial frequencies of 0. 5, 2. 5, 4, and 8 c/deg. Thirty chromaticities (evenly distributed across the <b>colour</b> gamut <b>triangle)</b> of the backgrounds in the equiluminant plane, and 24 in the ML plane (where S-contrast was zero), were tested. Five matches were made for each frequency and each background chromaticity. Viewing was binocular. For the low (0. 5 c/deg) frequency strips, the backgrounds were found to induce the colour, if any, approximately complimentary {{to that of the}} background (i. e., chromatic simultaneous contrast). For the high (8 c/deg) frequency, most backgrounds induced only illusory colours close to unique hues (yellow, blue, and green), with a few backgrounds inducing a mixture of green with blue. Then, the method of adjustment was used to determine the unique hues for the same three observers. A remarkable similarity was found between unique hues and illusory loci, suggesting that the illusion is due to a difference in the spatial resolution of the post-receptor channels producing the unique hues...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. There {{are various}} methods for extracting iso-surfaces from {{volumetric}} data. Many specific techniques {{have been developed}} to increase the speed of computation and decrease memory requirements. A comparison of the selected methods was made in different aspects. Surprisingly, experiments proved, that there is no direct relation between precision and human perception of the extracted iso-surface. Although a precision of the iso-surface extraction is very important as well, it is not mentioned usually. After the extraction, the surface (usually the triangular mesh) is displayed by a standard package that uses algorithms like constant, Gouraud or Phong shading, for shading polygonal meshes. Unfortunately the Gouraud and Phong shadings cannot be used in some cases as these techniques prefer the "smoothness " to "precision " of the displayed surface. In cases, when the <b>colour</b> of the <b>triangle</b> of the triangular mesh is given in a representative inner point for each triangle, both methods can lead to very misleading results. The S-shading method that respects the smoothness and precision in some extent can be used...|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of sets {{is called a}} weak A-system if sizes of all pairwise intersections of these sets coincide. We prove a new upper bound on the function. /~,. (n), the maximal size of a {{collection of}} n-element sets no three of which form a weak A-system. Namely, we prove that, for every 6 > 0. L,(n) = o(n! 1 " 2 +~). We say that three sets A,B,C form a (3 -) A-system if A ~ B = B c ~ C = C c ~ A. If a weaker condition IA c ~ BI = IB ~ CI = IC c ~ AI is satisfied then these sets are said to form a weak (3 -) A-system. A long-standing question, widely advertised by Erd 6 s, asks how large a collection of n-element sets can be if no three of its members form a A-system. Two problems are closely related with this one: its analogue for weak A-systems, and the problem of finding the maximal size r(n) of a complete graph whose edges can be coloured by n <b>colours</b> without monochromatic <b>triangles.</b> Denote by f(n), resp. by fw(n), the maximal size {{of a collection of}} n-element sets no three of which form a A-system, resp. a weak A-system. Note that the collection of N n-element sets without weak A-systems gives rise to a colouring of a complete graph on N vertices into n colours without monochromatic triangles; with elements of the system as vertices, and their intersection sizes as edge colours. Therefore fw(n) < ~ r(n); and obviously ji,. (w) < ~ f(n). The problem of determining the exact growth rate of fin) was first raised in [4]. Since then it {{has become one of the}} most famous unsolved problems in combinatorics, and one of the favourite problems of Erd 6 s.
