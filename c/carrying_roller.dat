Thengai Srinivasan was recruited to play Sriramachandramurthy. Balachander recalled, [...] "Normally I try to get all actors to modulate the dialogue in a particular manner but for this character I wanted Thengai {{to do it in}} his style, so instead of teaching him, I asked him how he would like to do the scene and then developed on it. I wanted him to play it as a character and not as a comedian for I felt that the humour would come out on its own through his unique body language and dialogue delivery". Nagesh appeared in a cameo role as himself. Sowkar Janaki was selected to appear in a role of socialite who is hired to pose as Chandran's mother. Viji, sister of actress Saritha, made her acting debut with this film, playing the sister of Chandran. The character is a skater, and Balachander cast her as such after noticing her <b>carrying</b> <b>roller</b> skates. At Balachander's insistence, Kamal Haasan made a cameo appearance as Charuhasan, an actor posing as a lawyer in the climax of the film. The name is a reference to Haasan's real-life brother. During the film's shooting, Rajinikanth met his future wife Latha, then a student of Ethiraj College for Women, who went to interview him for her college magazine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Transport {{of ground}} and coal {{at the surface}} coal dig in Kostolac, Serbia, is done using {{transportation}} belts (3 - 5 kilometres in length) using the systems of BTR (Bagger-Transporter-Remover) and BTM (Bagger-Transporter-Mill). The transporter belt during circular movement is suspended on carry-rollers (during transport of weight) and on support-rollers (without weight). Two or three carry-rollers, or three support-rollers make a garland. Garlands (5 carry and 3 supporting) are built into a section and they enable the movement of belt over them. The number of sections depends on the transportation system length. Reliability of these systems is governed by {{the reliability of the}} <b>carry</b> and support <b>rollers.</b> In order to determine the reliability of the BTR and BTM systems, reliability analysis of both <b>carry</b> and support <b>rollers</b> was performed using the method of Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD). In this paper the assessment of roller reliability is described using the FTA method with failure elements. The reliability function was determined {{on the basis of the}} RBD in the case where all of the constructive elements of the rollers are in operation – the complex relationship, and when some of the elements are in failure mode – the quasi-complex relationship...|$|R

At present, several fig trees have taken root and are growing over these foundations. There are remnants of the rollers and other machinery on one pair of foundations. To {{the west of}} the foundations once ran the carrier, which transported the cane from where it was unloaded into the rollers. It was a continuous belt of timber slats housed in steel chains running between axles, and remnants of these chains and axles remain. Beside the foundations is a copper tray, also reputedly from a nearby mill. To the east of the stack is the remains of a boiler. It was one of two which provided steam for the larger 50 hp engine which powered the mill. It was located beside the stack originally.|$|R

50|$|The MG 3 is an automatic, air-cooled, belt-fed short recoil-operated firearm. It {{features}} a roller locked bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} the bolt head, a pair of rollers, the striker sleeve, bolt body and return spring. The bolt is locked securely by a wedge-shaped striker sleeve, which forces two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head outward, and into corresponding recesses in {{the extension of the}} breech of the barrel. On firing, both the barrel and barrel extension recoil to the rear. The resulting impact (much like a Newton's cradle) moves the carrier to the rear withdrawing the wedge and both rollers as they are cammed inward and out of their sockets by fixed cams, unlocking the bolt head. The bolt carrier and bolt then continue to the rear together guided by fixed guides while the barrel and barrel extension return to battery. Upon return of the bolt forward, the impact of the rollers against the camming surfaces on the breech <b>carry</b> the <b>rollers</b> from their seats, and, together with the surfaces on the striker sleeve, force the rollers outward, locking the bolt head into the barrel extension and ensuring a complete lock. The bolt also houses a spring-loaded casing extractor and ejector. Ejection is carried out when the ejector strikes the buffer head, sending a push forward through the ejector bar, which hits the ejector pin. This pin pushes the top of the base of the cartridge, which is still held by the extractor at the base, causing the empty casing to rotate and eject downward through the ejection chute.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{behaviour}} of polymeric rollers employed in a cam mechanism of an industrial machine, {{consisting of two}} concentrically fitted rings made of polyurethane and short fibre-reinforced PEEK. A cyclic mechanical characterisation of the materials was at first carried out by strain controlled fatigue tests. The safe range of working conditions of the rollers in terms of rotating speed and contact load was then investigated by rolling contact tests <b>carried</b> out on <b>roller</b> prototypes with a dedicated test rig. These tests allowed obtaining important information about the different damage mechanisms occurring in the component: above a critical working temperature, rollers failure resulted from rings unfitting due to excessive deformations, while fatigue crack nucleation in the outer ring at the interface with the inner one was observed below this threshold, at high contact load levels. No contact fatigue damage appeared. FEM models of the roller were also developed, based on cyclic material data, in order to analyse the cyclic stress and strain field and to predict the fatigue life, finding a satisfactory agreement with the experimental rolling contact tests results...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to develop and {{validate}} an automatic algorithm for classification of cross-country (XC) ski-skating gears (G) using Smartphone accelerometer data. Eleven XC skiers (seven men, four women) with regional-to-international levels of performance <b>carried</b> out <b>roller</b> skiing trials on a treadmill using fixed gears (G 2 left, G 2 right, G 3, G 4 left, G 4 right) and a 950 -m trial using different speeds and inclines, applying gears and sides as they normally would. Gear classification by the Smartphone (on the chest) and based on video recordings were compared. Formachine-learning, a collective database was compared to individual data. The Smartphone application identified the trials with fixed gears correctly in all cases. In the 950 -m trial, participants executed 140 ± 22 cycles as assessed by video analysis, with the automatic Smartphone application giving a similar value. Based on collective data, gears were identified correctly 86. 0 % ± 8. 9 % of the time, a value that rose to 90. 3 % ± 4. 1 % (P < 0. 01) with machine learning from individual data. Classification was most often incorrect during transition between gears, especially to or from G 3. Identification was most often correct for skiers who made relatively few transitions between gears. The accuracy of the automatic procedure for identifying G 2 left, G 2 right, G 3, G 4 left and G 4 right was 96 %, 90 %, 81 %, 88 % and 94 %, respectively. The algorithm identified gears correctly 100 % of the time when a single gear was used and 90 % of the time when different gears were employed during a variable protocol. This algorithm could be improved with respect to identification of transitions between gears or the side employed within a given gear...|$|R
40|$|LPG {{tanks are}} {{essential}} storage device in refineries and were frequently subjected to SCC on inner surface during service {{and must be}} inspected from inside regularly. MT or PT are two conventional methods used for the inspection but is very costly and toilsome because of the requirement of scaffolding and the extreme hot working condition inside the tank. Practical experience had shown that epoxy layer may be applied on the inner surface of the LPG tanks to alleviate SCC however extra work of epoxy layer removal was required before MT or PT. In this study, an automated inspection method based on multi-channel electromagnetic technique was developed in lieu of conventional MT or PT.

Scarcely had the men gathered there than the vessel plunged her head into the sea. There was a loud report, and the top-gallant mast fell over her bows with a crash. Two of the Chilians with axes crawled out along the bowsprit and cut away the gear that held the spar alongside, and the wreckage at once floated away. The jib-boom was then got in, and the vessel felt the relief and lifted her head more buoyantly over the seas. For four days the gale continued, her bulwarks were carried away, and the waves swept her decks continually. One tremendous <b>roller</b> <b>carried</b> away the boats, the caboose, and all the deck fittings, together with four of the Chilians and six of the Peruvian sailors. The straining had opened her seams, and although the pumps had been kept going as long as the crew had been able to work at them, the water had been gaining steadily, and even the Chilians, who had kept on doggedly long after the Peruvians had thrown themselves down exhausted and hopeless, now ceased what was evidently a useless labour.|$|R
40|$|International audienceCorrelation between {{particulate}} {{organic carbon}} (POC) and calcium carbonate sinking through the deep ocean {{has led to the}} idea that ballast provided by calcium carbonate is important for the export of POC from the surface ocean. While this idea is certainly to some extent true, it is worth considering in more nuance, for example, examining the different effects on the aggregation and sinking of POC of small, non-sinking calcite particles like coccoliths and large, rapidly sinking calcite like planktonic foraminiferan tests. We have done that here in a simple experiment <b>carried</b> out in <b>roller</b> tanks that allow particles to sink continuously without being impeded by container walls. Coccoliths were efficiently incorporated into aggregates that formed during the experiment, increasing their sinking speed compared to similarly sized aggregates lacking added calcite ballast. The foraminiferan tests, which sank as fast as 700 md− 1, became associated with only very minor amounts of POC. In addition, when they collided with other, larger, foram-less aggregates, they fragmented them into two smaller, more slowly sinking aggregates. While these effects were certainly exaggerated {{within the confines of the}} rolling tanks, they clearly demonstrate that calcium carbonate ballast is not just calcium carbonate ballast - different forms of calcium carbonate ballast have notably different effects on POC aggregation, sinking, and export...|$|R
