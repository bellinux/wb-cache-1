50|$|Diamond plate, {{also known}} as <b>checker</b> <b>plate,</b> tread plate and Durbar floor plate, {{is a type of}} metal stock with a regular pattern of raised {{diamonds}} or lines on one side, with the reverse side being featureless. Diamond plate is usually steel, stainless steel or aluminum. Steel types are normally made by hot rolling, although modern manufacturers also make a raised and pressed diamond design.|$|E
40|$|Photocatalytically active TiO 2 -patterned {{polyimide}} (PI) films (PI-TiO 2) were fabricated using {{thermal transfer}} patterning (TTP). When subjected to hot pressing, the TiO 2 nanoparticles electrosprayed on steel mesh templates were successfully transferred and formed <b>checker</b> <b>plate</b> patterns on PI film. FE-SEM studies confirmed that pressing at 350  °C and 100  MPa was optimum for obtaining patterns with uniform TiO 2 coverage. When {{the quantity of}} TiO 2 on the template increased, the amount of it immobilized on PI film also increased from 0. 3245 to 1. 2378  mg per 25  cm 2. XPS studies confirmed the presence TiO 2 on the patterns, and indicated the formation of carboxylic acid and amide groups on the PI surface during TTP. When tested under UVA irradiation, PI-TiO 2 with 1. 2378  mg/ 25  cm 2 TiO 2 loading exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance for methylene blue (10  μM) degradation, with a rate constant of 0. 0225  min&# 8722; 1 and stable photocatalytic efficacy for 25 cycles of reuse. The PI-TiO 2 was also successfully used to degrade amoxicillin, atrazine, and 4 -chlorophenol. During photocatalysis, the toxicity of 4 -chlorophenol against Vibrio fischeri and the antibiotic activity of amoxicillin against Escherichia coli were decreased. Overall, TTP {{was found to be}} a potentially scalable method for fabricating robust immobilized TiO 2 photocatalyst...|$|E
50|$|Mobile radio base {{stations}} with flanged pole are mobile support structures {{composed of a}} special trailer with retracting stabilizers approved for road use. The antenna supporting pole, with climbing ladder up to the summit, is fixed to the main base frame and it is composed of cylindrical flanged sections integrated by two or three sets of guys with a standard height of up to 20 meters. The flanged pole mobile station, installable in eight hours, does not require civil works or foundations, and is complete of lateral ballast concrete weights and a working platform in <b>checkered</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
50|$|RDUs are mobile radio base {{stations}} transportable on trucks. Their use is strategic for the {{rapid expansion of}} cellular networks. A rapid deployment flanged pole is a mobile radio base station infrastructure transportable on truck, allowing fast and easy installation in restricted spaces. The antenna supporting pole, with climbing ladder up to the summit, is fixed to the main base frame and is composed of cylindrical flanged sections integrated by two or three sets of guys with a standard height of up to 30 meters. The flanged pole mobile station, installable in eight hours, does not require civil works or foundations, and is complete, including lateral ballast concrete weights and a working platform in <b>checkered</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|R
5000|$|An IJzerkoekje ( [...] , iron cookie) {{is a very}} {{specific}} 'soft' cookie, traditionally eaten by Dutch fishermen, especially in Vlaardingen, {{one of the main}} harbours of the Netherlands during the 19th and 20th centuries. It is an oval cookie over half an inch thick with a cinnamon 'creamy' taste. The cookies were invented in the city of Vlaardingen and are baked on a <b>checkered</b> iron <b>plate,</b> creating a characteristic pattern.|$|R
50|$|For an {{improved}} bridge deck made of steel, starting in 2004, <b>checkered</b> steel <b>plates</b> were contributed: in Vietnam and in Ecuador by the provincial governments, in Laos and Myanmar by the Argentinean mill of Ternium, one of Latin America’s principal steel producers.Also in 2005, Toni begins using wire rope {{from the mountain}} cable cars of his home country. In Switzerland, the cable cars are required to change these cables frequently, due to the tight safety regulations imposed by the government.|$|R
