40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} meta user {{interface}} {{to design the}} user interface to tune vector-valued parameters of a given parametrized model. In our framework, the user defines a desired number of <b>slider</b> <b>bars</b> to control the parameters. The number of <b>slider</b> <b>bars</b> is independent from the dimension of the original parametrized model, which is important to design perceptually plausible user interface. Those <b>slider</b> <b>bars</b> correspond to straight axes in the parameter space. If the axes are not perpendicular each other, change {{of the value of}} one <b>slider</b> <b>bar</b> affects other <b>slider</b> <b>bars,</b> which significantly degrades the usability of the system. Our system can minimize this effect by simply enabling the lock attribute of each <b>slider</b> <b>bar,</b> which orthogonalizes the corresponding axes in the parameter domain. We show an image color adjustment software as our application example. However, the underlying idea of our system can be applied to any parametrized models. ...|$|R

30|$|I now discuss more {{detailed}} aspects {{of running the}} model. Examining the interface of Figure 1, one sees the following attributes: the Display map is in the top center, and its geometry is discussed later. Plots A and B are off to the right, <b>slider</b> <b>bars,</b> on-off switches, as well as monitors, are all discussed subsequently. To start any run, one must click SETUP, which initiates a few random polar magnetic fields; this prevents division by zero, since averages over the interface are performed. Next, the GO/STOP button starts evolving the model in time. The display situated in the top-middle of the interface show the blue/red magnetic fields as they migrate across the solar disk. The two graphs on the right display average properties of polar magnetic fields (Plot A) and the latitudes of new regions (Plot B) per time step, as the model evolves. Above the Display {{are a number of}} generic added features of Netlogo, e.g. a <b>slider</b> <b>bar</b> to speed up the entire processing, however, at high speed the display itself does not keep up with the timesteps, owing to the huge volume of features required to redraw. The field motion calculations are not affected by the speed of the display; all motions are calculated with very high accuracy. Let us now go through the features of our particular solar magnetic field mapping model and its usage in Netlogo.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The project aims {{to create}} an {{alternative}} search interface for MEDLINE/PubMed that may provide assistance to the novice user and added convenience to the advanced user. An earlier version {{of the project was}} the 'Slider Interface for MEDLINE/PubMed searches' (SLIM) which provided JavaScript <b>slider</b> <b>bars</b> to control search parameters. In this new version, recent developments in Web-based technologies were implemented. These changes may prove to be even more valuable in enhancing user interactivity through client-side manipulation and management of results. Results PubMed Interact is a Web-based MEDLINE/PubMed search application built with HTML, JavaScript and PHP. It is implemented on a Windows Server 2003 with Apache 2. 0. 52, PHP 4. 4. 1 and MySQL 4. 1. 18. PHP scripts provide the backend engine that connects with E-Utilities and parses XML files. JavaScript manages client-side functionalities and converts Web pages into interactive platforms using dynamic HTML (DHTML), Document Object Model (DOM) tree manipulation and Ajax methods. With PubMed Interact, users can limit searches with JavaScript <b>slider</b> <b>bars,</b> preview result counts, delete citations from the list, display and add related articles and create relevance lists. Many interactive features occur at client-side, which allow instant feedback without reloading or refreshing the page resulting in a more efficient user experience. Conclusion PubMed Interact is a highly interactive Web-based search application for MEDLINE/PubMed that explores recent trends in Web technologies like DOM tree manipulation and Ajax. It may become a valuable technical development for online medical search applications. </p...|$|R

In this paper we provide evidence for the converse, that beliefs about causation influence the perception of temporal order. Participants that learned the structure of causal relations among a set of <b>slider</b> <b>bars</b> on a computer screen were biased to report the movements of the sliders as conforming to a temporal order consistent with their causal beliefs despite the absence of a correlation between temporal order and causal structure in the stimuli...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} whether expressing emotional states using a simple line drawing {{to represent a}} robot's face can serve to elicit altruistic behavior from humans. An experimental investigation was conducted in which human participants interacted with a humanoid robot whose facial expression was shown on an LCD monitor that was mounted as its head (Study 1). Participants were asked to play the ultimatum game, which is usually used to measure human altruistic behavior. All participants were assigned to be the proposer and were instructed to decide their offer within 1 min by controlling a <b>slider</b> <b>bar.</b> The corners of the robot's mouth, {{as indicated by the}} line drawing, simply moved upward, or downward depending on the position of the <b>slider</b> <b>bar.</b> The results suggest that the change in the facial expression depicted by a simple line drawing of a face significantly affected the participant's final offer in the ultimatum game. The offers were increased by 13 % when subjects were shown contingent changes of facial expression. The results were compared with an experiment in a teleoperation setting in which participants interacted with another person through a computer display showing the same line drawings used in Study 1 (Study 2). The results showed that offers were 15 % higher if participants were shown a contingent facial expression change. Together, Studies 1 and 2 indicate that emotional expression in simple line drawings of a robot's face elicits the same higher offer from humans as a human telepresence does...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of {{nonionic}} surfactant on removal of contamination and also investigates {{the impact of}} surfactant temperature on <b>slider</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion. The experiments were carried out for various ultrasonic frequencies, sonication time, sonication power and surfactant temperatures. Different parts of corrosion suspect parts were analysed to identify the corrosion by using nano scanning electron microscope SEM technique. Potentiostat tests were carried out to identify the corrosion potential for different surfactant temperatures. From experimental results, it can be observed that the corrosion rate was slightly higher for 60 οC surfactant temperature as compared to 25 οC. The results indicates that the removal efficiency of glue contamination and other particulate contamination improved from 67 % (Surfactant temperature 25 οC) to 85 % (Surfactant temp 55 οC) but when the temperature was over 55 οC the removal rate was decreased. This {{is due to the}} fact that at temperature around 50 - 55 οC the solubility of surfactant in water is higher and therefore the surfactant becomes more active. At higher temperature (more than 55 οC) the solubility of surfactant in water is poor. The surfactant seperates out from water and the liquid becomes cloudy. When the surfactant temperature exceeds the cloud point, the effect of surfactant is lowered. From data it can also be seen that 2 % surfactant concentration gives higher removal efficiency as compared to other concentration levels. From SEM analysis, no <b>slider</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion was found for both 25 and 60 οC surfactant temperature. The optimum sonication time and ultrasonic power obtained was 3 min and 250 W respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background With {{the rapid}} growth of medical {{information}} and the pervasiveness of the Internet, online search and retrieval systems have become indispensable tools in medicine. The progress of Web technologies can provide expert searching capabilities to non-expert information seekers. The objective of the project is to create an alternative search interface for MEDLINE/PubMed searches using JavaScript <b>slider</b> <b>bars.</b> SLIM, or Slider Interface for MEDLINE/PubMed searches, was developed with PHP and JavaScript. Interactive <b>slider</b> <b>bars</b> in the search form controlled search parameters such as limits, filters and MeSH terminologies. Connections to PubMed were done using the Entrez Programming Utilities (E-Utilities). Custom scripts were created to mimic the automatic term mapping process of Entrez. Page generation times for both local and remote connections were recorded. Results Alpha testing by developers showed SLIM to be functionally stable. Page generation times to simulate loading times were recorded the first week of alpha and beta testing. Average page generation times for the index page, previews and searches were 2. 94 milliseconds, 0. 63 seconds and 3. 84 seconds, respectively. Eighteen physicians from the US, Australia and the Philippines participated in the beta testing and provided feedback through an online survey. Most users found the search interface user-friendly and easy to use. Information on MeSH terms and the ability to instantly hide and display abstracts were identified as distinctive features. Conclusion SLIM can be an interactive time-saving tool for online medical literature research that improves user control and capability to instantly refine and refocus search strategies. With continued development and by integrating search limits, methodology filters, MeSH terms and levels of evidence, SLIM may be useful in the practice of evidence-based medicine. </p...|$|R

It is a visual representation of the events that took place over time on the space. It is a simple tool that takes input from the users to represent the data on the map in timely manner. This tool is designed keeping in mind a vast set of users like from regular users to teacher, students, computer science students, professors etc. This tool can be mainly used for school projects by the teachers to help the students know more about history or any events that took place over time. Important inventions can be displayed in space vs. time on the map like displaying the "History of pi" which is greatly useful for mathematics students. This tool is very interactive {{in the sense that the}} user is asked to enter the start and end year, also interval between the years for the period he wants to see the time line for. Depending on the data entered by the user, the <b>slider</b> <b>bar</b> on the map is represented with start and end years and the user given interval is used to mark the interval between the years on the <b>slider</b> <b>bar.</b> Users have control over the timeline they want to see and also the distance or gap between the years. Users also enter data for each event point like latitude, longitude, description and further data related to the event point. Users also upload pictures related to the event, wiki links and video links for the event points. Users can see a clear representation of the points on the map as the time line <b>slider</b> <b>bar</b> is moved. For each and every point user can click on the point to know more about the event point. Information, description, picture, wiki and video links can be seen for the point by clicking it. A lot of map objects toolbars and custom tool bars have been added to make the tool more interactive and give the users a choice of playing around or getting more knowledge from the tool.

Attaching the isovalue to an interactive input, such as a <b>slider</b> <b>bar</b> or a dial, provides further insight as one watches the isosurfaces change shape and meld into each other.

Artists have been expert at mixing colour for centuries, yet although the artist and designer has access {{to a wide range of}} digital imaging tools and technologies, that on first glance, are dedicated to the creation of colour mixtures, the resulting colours are often disappointing.
