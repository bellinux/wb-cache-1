We report on the outcome after thalamic centro-median (CM) DBS in patients with generalized epilepsy who had been previously treated with extended callosal section. MethodsFour consecutive patients with generalized epilepsy who were previously submitted to callosal section and had at least 1 year of follow-up after deep brain implantation were studied. Age ranged from 19 to 44 years. All patients were submitted to bilateral CM thalamic DBS. Post-operative <b>CT</b> scans <b>documented</b> the electrode position in all patients. All patients had pre- and post-stimulation prolonged interictal scalp EEG recordings, including spike counts. Attention level was evaluated by means of the SNAP-IV questionnaire. The pre-implantation anti-epileptic drug regimen was maintained post-operatively in all patients. ResultsPost-operative <b>CT</b> <b>documented</b> that all electrodes were correctly located. There was no morbidity or mortality. Seizure frequency reduction ranging from 65 to 95 % and increased attention level was seen in all patients. Interictal spiking frequency was reduced from 25 to 95 %, but their morphology remained the same. There was re-synchronization of interictal discharges during slow-wave sleep in 2 patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Results of hemiarthroplasty after acute complex {{proximal}} humerus fractures are controversial. The {{main problem}} is the fixation and healing of the greater tuberosity (GT). To address this problem a hemiarthroplasty with a large metaphyseal volume was designed and introduced. METHODS: Thirty hemiarthroplasties were implanted for acute, complex, proximal humeral fractures in  30 consecutive patients (average age: 63. 3  years; range, 41 - 78). One patient was lost; 2 patients could only be interviewed telefonically. Two patients had to be revised because of secondary displacement of the GT within the first 2 postoperative years. The remaining 25 patients were assessed clinically, radiographically, and with computer tomography (CT) imaging after a mean of 25  months (range, 24 - 29). RESULTS: Greater tuberosity healed in situ in 23 patients. In 12 cases, <b>CT</b> <b>documented</b> severe resorption of GT without displacement of a measurable bone fragment and an intact clinical cuff function with a radiographically preserved acromio-humeral distance.

40|$|Abstract from short. pdf file. Thesis supervisor: Dr. Carol R. Reinero. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In an {{experimental}} model of feline asthma, computed tomography (CT) and ventilator-acquired pulmonary mechanics {{were used in}} the assessment of various conditions. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed to induce airflow limitation. First, it was hypothesized that the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 2 cmH₂O or inspired oxygen concentration of 30 % would improve pulmonary mechanics and decrease evidence of atelectasis compared with no PEEP or 100 % O₂ in cats undergoing BAL. Secondly, it was hypothesized that heliox-driven nebulization of albuterol (heliox/albuterol) would lead superior reduction in airflow limitation and <b>CT</b> <b>documented</b> anatomic changes compared with heliox/saline, nitrox/albuterol or nitrox/saline 24 hrs post-allergen challenge and 5 minutes post-BAL. In the first study, the use of 30 % inspired oxygen concentration failed to show any significant improvement in pulmonary mechanics but did diminish atelectasis. It was also associated with further desaturation of hemoglobin in some cats. The modest levels of PEEP employed were without effect on any of our outcome parameters. In the second study, heliox failed to demonstrate any benefit in terms of oxygenation, pulmonary mechanics, or CT features. As expected, nebulized albuterol improved peak airway pressure when compared with saline nebulization. In this study mechanical ventilation and the use of PEEP may have altered our outcome parameters, especially in regard to CT attenuation and portions of lung aeration.

40|$|Abstract Background The HIV and AIDS {{epidemic}} in Malawi poses multiple challenges from an equity perspective. It {{is estimated that}} 12 % of Malawians are living with HIV or AIDS among the 15 - 49 age group. This paper synthesises available information to bring an equity lens on Counselling and Testing (CT) and Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) policy, practice and provision in Malawi. Methods A synthesis {{of a wide range}} of published and unpublished reports and studies using a variety of methodological approaches was undertaken. The analysis and recommendations were developed, through consultation with key stakeholders in Malawi. Findings At the policy level Malawi is unique in having an equity in access to ART policy, and equity considerations are also included in key <b>CT</b> <b>documents.</b> The number of people accessing CT has increased considerably from 149, 540 in 2002 to 482, 364 in 2005. There is urban bias in provision of CT and more women than men access CT. ART has been provided free since June 2004 and scale up of ART provision is gathering pace. By end December 2006, there were 85, 168 patients who had ever started on ART in both the public and private health sector, 39 % of the patients were male while 61 % were female. The majority of patients were adults, and 7 % were children, aged 14 years or below. Despite free ART services, patients, especially poor rural patients face significant barriers in access and adherence to services. There are missed opportunities in strengthening integration between CT and ART and TB, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) and maternal health services. Conclusion To promote equitable access for CT and ART in Malawi there is need to further invest in human resources for health, and seize opportunities to integrate CT and ART services with tuberculosis, sexually transmitted infections and maternal health services. This should not only promote access to services but also ensure that resources available for CT and ART strengthen rather than undermine the provision of the essential health package in Malawi. Ongoing equity analysis of services is important in analyzing which groups are unrepresented in services and developing initiatives to address these. Creative models of decentralization, whilst maintaining quality of services are needed to further enhance access of poor rural women, men, girls and boys. </p...|$|R

The vast majority of CRC develop from benign precursor lesions, so-called adenomatous polyps, which via the adenoma-carcinoma pathway may eventually transform into colon cancer. It has been shown that endoscopic removal of adenomas interrupts this pathway and subsequently reduces CRC incidence and cancer-related mortality. Thus endoscopic CRC screening programs have been instituted in many coun-tries to reduced CRC cancer mortality.

40|$|Spiral CT {{has proved}} to be a {{valuable}} tool by providing various kinds of three-dimensional (3 D) images of the studied structures. Such 3 D images, which offer a more realistic depiction of the lesions, could be of interest for surgeons who are attempting to treat conservatively blunt abdominal traumas and lead to less inappropriate triage between conservative and operative management particularly for renal trauma. A good working relationship between surgeons and radiologists allowed us to perform an early follow-up 3 D spiral CT on a commercially available spiral CT scanner. In the first adult patient, the 3 D CT demonstrated minor spleen injury associated with severe lacerations of the left kidney with complete separation of the kidney lower pole. A delayed partial lower nephrectomy was performed.

40|$|Objective: Unusual {{clinical}} course Background: Trauma is {{the leading}} cause of death in people younger than 45 years and head injury is the main cause of trauma mortality. Although epidural hematomas are relatively uncommon (less than 1 % of all patients with head injuries and fewer than 10 % of those who are comatose), they should always be considered in evalua-tion of a serious head injury. Patients with epidural hematomas who meet surgical criteria and receive prompt surgical intervention can have an excellent prognosis, presumably owing to limited underlying primary brain damage from the traumatic event. The decision to perform a surgery in a patient with a traumatic extraaxi-al hematoma is dependent on several factors (neurological status, size of hematoma, age of patients, CT find-ings) but also may depend on the judgement of the treating neurosurgeon. Case Report: A 30 -year old man arrived at our Emergency Department after a traumatic brain injury. General examination revealed severe headache, no motor or sensory disturbances, and no clinical signs of intracranial hypertension. A <b>CT</b> scan <b>documented</b> a significant left fronto-parietal epidural hematoma, which was considered suitable for surgical evacuation. The patient refused surgery. Following CT scan revealed a minimal increase in the size of the hematoma and of midline shift. The neurologic examination maintained stable and the patient continued to refuse the surgical treatment. Next follow up CT scans demonstrated a progressive resorption of hematoma...|$|R
