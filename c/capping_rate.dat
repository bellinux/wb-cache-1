An optical active Acrylate end-functionalized poly (lactic acid) (DPLA) was {{synthesized}} via melt polycondensation, with lactic acid, polyalcohol and {{acrylic acid}} as raw materials. The prepolymer products in each process {{were characterized by}} FT-IR, 1 H-NMR. The curing PLA coating (CPLA) was prepared using optical active DPLA, reactive diluent and photoinitiator. Gel fraction, thermal stability and degradation properties of the UV curing PLA coating properties were evaluated. The results show that branched structure of hydroxyl-terminated poly (lactic acid) (OHPLA) is beneficial to increase acrylic end <b>capping</b> <b>rate</b> (Da), Da ois as high as 88 %. The structure of prepolymer {{and the performance of}} the coating are adjusted by changing content of polyalcohol. After crosslinking modification, degradation rate of CPLA is reduced and CPLA has better thermal stability than the pure PLA...|$|E
40|$|The {{directed}} polymerization of actin networks is {{an essential}} element of many biological processes, including cell migration. Different theoretical models considering the interplay between the underlying processes of polymerization, capping and branching have resulted in conflicting predictions. One of the main reasons for this discrepancy is the assumption of a branching reaction that is either first order (autocatalytic) or zeroth order in the number of existing filaments. Here we introduce a unifying framework from which the two established scenarios emerge as limiting cases for low and high filament number. A smooth transition between the two cases is found at intermediate conditions. We also derive a threshold for the <b>capping</b> <b>rate,</b> above which autocatalytic growth is predicted at sufficiently low filament number. Below the threshold, zeroth order characteristics are predicted to dominate the dynamics of the network for all accessible filament numbers. Together, this allows cells to grow stable actin networks over a large range of different conditions. Comment: revtex, 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{growth of}} an actin network against an {{obstacle}} that stimulates branching locally is studied using several variants of a kinetic rate model {{based on the}} orientation-dependent number density of filaments. The model emphasizes the effects of branching and capping on the density of free filament ends. The variants differ in their treatment of side versus end branching and dimensionality, and assume that new branches are generated by existing branches (autocatalytic behavior) or independently of existing branches (nucleation behavior). In autocatalytic models, the network growth velocity is rigorously independent of the opposing force exerted by the obstacle, and the network density {{is proportional to the}} force. The dependence of the growth velocity on the branching and capping rates is evaluated by a numerical solution of the rate equations. In side-branching models, the growth velocity drops gradually to zero with decreasing branching rate, while in end-branching models the drop is abrupt. As the <b>capping</b> <b>rate</b> goes to zero, it is found that the behavior of the velocity is sensitive to the thickness of the branching region.

40|$|In {{the first}} paper {{the effect of}} {{accessibility}} upon rent is investigated for office properties located in Downtown Stockholm. Starting from the firm’s cost minimization problem, a translog hedonic model is derived. The results suggest the model has good predictive power in explaining the variation in the log of the rent. A negative rent gradient is obtained with a base approximately 90 meters from the postulated focal point. It appears as if Space Syntax adds important information {{to the understanding of}} the intraurban office rent pattern. The second paper investigates assumed capitalisation rates in 3026 discounted cash flow valuations of office properties in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö during the time period 1998 - 2004. The study investigates determinants of property-level variation in <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> and how going in and exit <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> relate to each other. Exit <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> exhibit substantial variation across properties. Part of this cross-sectional variation can be attributed to the location of the property, part of it is due to other characteristics of the property. Exit <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> are differentiated between properties of the same type on the same market segment, which shows that valuers apply property level fine-tuning when setting exit <b>cap</b> <b>rates.</b> Properties with low market rent and high long-run vacancy assumption typically have high exit <b>cap</b> <b>rates.</b> Properties in peripheral parts of a city typically have higher exit <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> than properties in central parts. The implicitly assumed going-in <b>cap</b> <b>rate</b> (defined as assumed net operating income year one divided by estimated market value) follows a similar pattern as the exit <b>cap</b> <b>rate</b> but exhibits more temporary, property-specific variation. Going-in <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> are strongly influenced by temporary deviations of vacancy rates and rents from assumed “normal” levels of vacancy and rent. The difference between going-in and exit <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> is influenced by assumed short-run growth in net operating income in the way stipulated by theory: high assumed short-run growth is associated with going-in <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> being lower than exit <b>cap</b> <b>rates.</b> QC 2010111...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFilopodium, a spike-like actin {{protrusion}} at {{the leading}} edge of migrating cells, functions as a sensor of the local environment and has a mechanical role in protrusion. We use modeling to examine mechanics and spatial-temporal dynamics of filopodia. We find that > 10 actin filaments have to be bundled to overcome the membrane resistance and that the filopodial length is limited by buckling for 10 – 30 filaments and by G-actin diffusion for > 30 filaments. There is an optimal number of bundled filaments, ∼ 30, at which the filopodial length can reach a few microns. The model explains characteristic interfilopodial distance of a few microns as a balance of initiation, lateral drift, and merging of the filopodia. The theory suggests that F-actin barbed ends have to be focused and protected from capping (the <b>capping</b> <b>rate</b> has to decrease one order of magnitude) once every hundred seconds per micron of {{the leading edge}} to initiate the observed number of filopodia. The model generates testable predictions about how filopodial length, rate of growth, and interfilopodial distance should depend on the number of bundled filaments, membrane resistance, lamellipodial protrusion rate, and G-actin diffusion coefficient...|$|E

40|$|Behaviour {{of single}} {{bacterium}} have been mysterious {{for many years}} due to the technical difficulty and nature of bacteria forming communities. It has not been long since engineers and scientists have started to develop various techniques and devices to study and isolate single bacterium. In the present thesis, three subprojects with a common theme of applying single bacterium cells for engineering application or investigating regulation of gene expressions is introduced. Recently, metal structures with micrometer dimensions have been fabricated and successfully utilized to isolate single bacterial cells with dimensions similar to the designed pillars. First project further develops previously discovered feature of single bacterial cell isolation by metal hollow structures to capture polymeric nanoparticles inside the hollow structures. High achievement rates of filling the nanoparticles inside the structures and subsequently capping the top opening of hollow pillars have been attained. The study demonstrates that the shape of structures affects both the capturing rate and <b>capping</b> <b>rate</b> of nanoparticles. In the second project, a fabrication method and result of simple template to obtain well organized array of single bacterial cells is shown. The bacterial cells with size less than micrometer are patterned on a gold substrate in a uniform matter. The technique developed here requires no additional binding agent nor chemical modification of the substrate which provides an advantage in saving the processing time and cost in comparison to existing techniques developed to isolate single bacterial cells. The isolated bacterial cells are further engineered with magnetic nanoparticles to illustrate bacterial cell wall property remaining the constant after deposition. In the last project, promoter activity of single cells has been analyzed to study the population behaviour of the bacterial culture. In contrast to {{the assumption that the}} behaviour of a single bacterium would be identical as a group, the opposite behaviour was found. In the thesis, phenotypic heterogeneity within a promoter that may correlate with the external morphology is shown. During the experiment, two different morphology of cells were observed to exist in a single culture, a short cell and a long elongated cell and the promoter activity correlated with the morphology where the short body ones had higher activity in the promoter compared to the long ones.

40|$|We {{consider}} a log-linearized {{version of a}} discounted rents model to price commercial real estate {{as an alternative to}} traditional hedonic models. First, we verify a key implication of the model, namely, that <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> forecast commercial real estate returns. We do this using two different methodologies: time series regressions of 21 US metropolitan areas and mixed data sampling (MIDAS) regressions with aggregate REIT returns. Both approaches confirm that the <b>cap</b> <b>rate</b> is related to fluctuations in future returns. We also investigate the provenance of the predictability. Based on the model, we decompose fluctuations in the <b>cap</b> <b>rate</b> into three parts: (i) local state variables (demographic and local economic variables); (ii) growth in rents; and (iii) an orthogonal part. About 30 % of the fluctuation in the <b>cap</b> <b>rate</b> is explained by the local state variables and the growth in rents.

For offices, by contrast, the <b>cap</b> <b>rate</b> does not forecast returns even though adsditional evidence reveals that expected returns on offices are also time-varying. We link this varying success of the <b>cap</b> <b>rate</b> in forecastings commercial property returns to differences in the stochastic properties of their rental growth rates.

40|$|Crawling {{motion is}} {{characteristic}} of most animal cells and is principally based on actin-myosin II cytoskeletal system. The major components and reactions contributing to motility have been identified, but the overall picture of how these molecular events are orchestrated to result in {{the motion of the}} cell is still missing. We used a combination of experimental imaging, image analysis, and numerical modeling to analyze at a quantitative level how the elements of the actin-myosin machinery are coordinated in several important aspects of the crawling motion: the assembly of the characteristic pattern of actin network in the leading lamellipodium, the interaction between retrograde flow of the actin network and substrate adhesions, and the coordination of motion and assembly of actin and myosin II polymers over the entire cell during steady-state migration. First, we used enhanced phase contrast microscopy correlated with fluorescence and electron microscopy to investigate the supra-filament organization of actin in the lamellipodium of motile fish epidermal keratocytes. We showed a close correspondence between individual filament orientations and optical criss-cross network pattern by quantifying the orientational distribution of features in electron microscopy and optical microscopy images. We tested the hypothesis that the criss-cross pattern observed by optical microscopy results from variation of actin density, which is due to stochastic events of branching and capping of filaments. Based on this hypothesis, we produced simulated images of lamellipodium similar to experimental images. These simulations provided quantitative tools to estimate structural and dynamical parameters of the actin network in lamellipodia, notably the filament length, the actin concentration, the curvature of filaments and <b>capping</b> <b>rate.</b> Protrusion {{at the edge of the}} cell is coupled to the substrate adhesion, but at the same time is associated with the retrograde flow of the actin network away from the edge. We observed that focal adhesions were mostly localized at the boundary between the fast retrograde flow zone (the lamellipodium) and the slower flow zone (the lamellum). We analyzed simultaneously the actin flow and the formation of focal adhesion. Based on these results, we proposed a multi-stage model for the advance of the leading edge of migrating cell: advance of the lamellipodium is followed by the formation of the nascent adhesion complexes, which results in the reduction of the flow rate, advance of the lamellum, and then protrusion of the lamellipodium from a new base. We finally focused on the dynamics of the acto-myosin system in entire migrating cell. For this purpose, we developed a tracking program which allowed quantifying motion, contraction and assembly of cytoskeletal components. We measured the dynamics of actin, myosin II and their relative motion in migrating fish keratocytes. These results supported the dynamic network contraction model suggesting that the actin network deformed by myosin II drives the translocation of cell body. Focusing on the different aspects of the crawling motion, and balancing experimental and theoretical approaches, we obtained original results, which contributed to a better understanding of the dynamics of the lamellipodium and crawling motion in general...|$|E
40|$|Terminally {{functionalised}} oligo(vinyl ether) s {{were produced}} in ab initio cationic polymerisations. Various polymerisations and chain end functionalisation systems were investigated. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry {{was applied to}} analyse the obtained oligomers and thus the polymerisation and chain end functionalisation process. Oligo(isobutyl vinyl ether), also oligo(ethyl vinyl ether) and oligo(methyl vinyl ether) were synthesised in cationic polymerisation. Silyl enol ethers {{were added to the}} polymerisation as end-capping agents before initiations and they compete with monomer to cap the carbocationic chain end. The methodology relies on a comparable end <b>capping</b> <b>rate</b> to chain propagation rate so that oligomers can still be produced in the presence of reactive end-capping agents whilst other side reactions are suppressed. Polymerisation temperatures investigated range from - 78 °C to the room temperature (21 °C), 4 out of 6 silyl enol ethers were applied and are proved to be reactive in the end-capping. Initiation systems investigated include iBVEHCl/Yb(OTf) 3 and iBVE-HCl/SnC 14 and both produced oligomers with high chain end functionalities. Generally silyl enol ether functionalised oligo(vinyl ether) s have lower molecular weights and broader molecular weight distributions than their identical control polymerisations without end-capping. The iBVE-HCl/SnCI 4 initiation system produced functionalised oligomers with narrower molecular weight distribution than iBVE-HCl/Yb(OTf) 3 initiation system. Different silyl enol ether reactivities in end-capping were observed. It was also observed that ab initio chain end functionalisation by reactive silyl enol ethers largely suppressed the majority of side reactions during polymerisation. This suppression was attributed to the higher rates of end-capping than side reaction rates. When (1 -tert-butyl-vinyloxy) trimethyl-silane was applied as end-capping agent, the polymerisation system produced oligomers with narrower molecular weight distributions than the control polymerisations without end-capping while the chain end functionalities were also obtained. This indicates the possibility of setting up a controlled ab initio chain end functionalisation cationic polymerisation system in which the oligomer's molecular weight, polydispersity and chain end functionality can be regulated at the same time. MALDI-TOF MS, NMR and SEC are mainly applied in the oligomer characterisation. Side reactions in this polymerisation system were examined from these analyses. Under less critical polymerisation conditions 7 different chain ends from side reactions are observed in MALDI-TOF mass spectra. Based on the MS and NMR observation the various chain end structures are identified. Side reactions are also postulated which mainly include ß-proton elimination, water capping of the carbocationic chain end and combinations of these. Sample preparation for MALDI-TOF MS analysis of oligo(vinyl ether) s is investigated. Direct laser desorption of oligo(isobutyl vinyl ether) was observed for the samples of molecular weight of up to 2 k Daltons. Complementary information of oligo(isobutyl vinyl ether) s obtained from ESI MS indicates a serious mass discrimination in MALDI-TOF MS technique and thus it is regarded that MALDITOF MS can not provide reliable molecular weight distributions for polymers with broad molecular weight distributions. Combination of SEC and MALDI-TOF MS to calibrate SEC columns and quantitative application of MALDI-TOF MS to analyse the oligomers' chain end functionalities were also explored...|$|E

40|$|This thesis has a {{two-fold}} objective, namely {{to explore}} the role of <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> in predicting the returns to commercial real estate, and to identify how <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> {{can be used to}} improve the allocation of real estate in a dynamic investment portfolio. Seeking an answer to the first question, we run predictive regressions using data for real estate "All Properties" and for all four major property types, examining the predictability power of <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> for a forecasting horizon from one to four quarters in the future. Moreover, we examine whether or not stock dividend-price ratio can predict real estate returns, and examine the predictability of stock returns by <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> and dividend-price ratio. The analysis confirms that both <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> and the dividend-price ratio can predict real estate "All Properties" returns for up to one year in the future. Concerning the analysis per property type, the results vary from property type to property type, and for different forecast horizons. Moreover, the analysis shows that stock returns can be predicted by the dividend-price ratio at all forecast horizons, whereas the <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> seem to have somewhat limited predictive power regarding the stock returns. We approach the second question by following the dynamic portfolio allocation methodology proposed by Brandt and Santa-Clara (2006). We expand the existing set of "basis" assets comprised of stocks and real estate to include "conditional" portfolios, and then compute the portfolio weights of this expanded set of assets by applying the Markowitz solution to the optimization problem. We apply this methodology to three different portfolio rebalancing horizons. Moreover, we work with three cases for each portfolio, i. e. with the unconditional case, with the case where the dividend-price ratio is the only conditioning variable, and with the case where the <b>cap</b> <b>rate</b> is the second conditioning variable. In almost all instances the results confirm that, by adding the <b>cap</b> <b>rate</b> as an additional state variable, the performance of the portfolios increases significantly. The same conclusion stands when we impose a "no shorting" restriction to real estate, although now the role of <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> seems somewhat less significant. by Stylianos Avramidis.

The increased level of commercial mortgage loan defaults from 1 % {{at the start}} of 2009 to 9. 32 % by the end of 2011 provides motivation for questioning underwriting standards which previously served the lending industry well. This dissertation investigates factors that affect the probability of Non-performance among commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) loans, proposes conditions under which the standard ratios may not apply, and tests additional criteria which may prove useful during economic periods previously not experienced by commercial mortgage underwriters. In this dissertation, <b>Cap</b> <b>Rate</b> Spread, the difference between the <b>cap</b> <b>rate</b> of a property and the Coupon Rate of the associated loan, is introduced to test whether the probability of Non-performance can be better predicted than by relying on traditional commercial mortgage underwriting criteria such as Loan to Value (LTV) and Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR). Testing the research hypotheses with a probit model using a database of 47, 883 U. S. CMBS loans from 1993 to 2011, <b>Cap</b> <b>Rate</b> Spread is found to have a significantly negative relationship with loan Non-performance. That is, as the <b>Cap</b> <b>Rate</b> Spread falls, the probability of Non-performance rises appreciably. A numerical model suggests that among loans which would have passed the standard ratio tests requiring loans to have values of LTV less than. 8 and DSCR greater than 1. 25, a <b>Cap</b> <b>Rate</b> Spread criteria requiring loans to have a value greater than 1 % would have prevented the origination of an additional 1, 798 CMBS loans reducing the rate of Non-performance from 14. 9 % with only the LTV and DSCR criteria to just 11. 6 % by adding the <b>Cap</b> <b>Rate</b> Spread criteria. Of course, adding additional criteria will also lead to errors of rejecting loans which would have performed well. Back testing with the same sample of CMBS loans, this Type I error rate rises from 19 % with only the LTV and DSCR criteria to 34 % with the addition of the <b>Cap</b> <b>Rate</b> Spread. Ultimately, CMBS loan underwriters must individually determine an acceptable level of Non-performance appropriate to their business model and tolerance for risk. Using intuition, experience, tools, and rules, each underwriter must choose a balance between the competing risks of rejecting potentially profitable loans and accepting loans which will fail. This research result is important because it helps deepen our understanding of the relationships between property income and loan performance and provides an additional tool that underwriters may employ in assessing CMBS loan risk...|$|R

But a {{correlation}} analysis indicates that <b>cap</b> <b>rates</b> have been largely unresponsive to alternative rates of return available to investors, {{with the exception of}} BBB bonds, over most of the past 25 years.
