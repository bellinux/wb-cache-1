5|$|The {{riddle of}} water and {{nutrient}} transport through the plant remained. Physiologist Von Mohl explored solute transport and the theory of water uptake by the roots using the concepts of cohesion, transpirational pull, <b>capillarity</b> and root pressure. German dominance {{in the field of}} physiology was underlined by the publication of the definitive textbook on plant physiology synthesising the work of this period, Sach's e of 1882. There were, however, some advances elsewhere such as the early exploration of geotropism (the effect of gravity on growth) by Englishman Thomas Knight, and the discovery and naming of osmosis by Frenchman Henri Dutrochet (1776–1847).|$|E

25|$|The liquid {{activated}} high-energy mixture {{can be used}} {{by itself}} for casting small architectural details and decorative items, or foamed (expanded) for lightweight concrete. HEM Nanoconcrete hardens in low and subzero temperature conditions and possesses an increased volume of gel, which reduces <b>capillarity</b> in solid and porous materials.|$|E
25|$|Because of its size, {{the tree}} {{has been studied}} for its water pull. Water from the roots can be pushed up only a few meters by osmotic {{pressure}} but can reach extreme heights by using a system of branching <b>capillarity</b> (capillary action) in the tree's xylem (the water tubules) and sub-pressure from evaporating water at the leaves. Sequoias supplement water from the soil with fog, taken up through air roots, at heights to where the root water cannot be pulled.|$|E
25|$|A {{counting}} chamber,(also {{known as}} hemocytometer), is a microscope slide that is especially designed to enable cell counting. The hemocytometer has two gridded chambers in its middle, which {{are covered with}} a special glass slide when counting. A drop of cell culture {{is placed in the}} space between the chamber and the glass cover, filling it by <b>capillarity.</b> Looking at the sample under the microscope, the researcher uses the grid to manually count the number of cells in a certain area of known size. The separating distance between the chamber and the cover is predefined, thus the volume of the counted culture can be calculated and with it the concentration of cells. Cell viability can also be determined if viability dyes are added to the fluid.|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis is {{generally}} associated with aerobic exercise and endurance exercise. While arteriogenesis produces network changes {{that allow for}} a large increase {{in the amount of}} total flow in a network, angiogenesis causes changes that allow for greater nutrient delivery {{over a long period of}} time. Capillaries are designed to provide maximum nutrient delivery efficiency, so an increase in the number of capillaries allows the network to deliver more nutrients in the same amount of time. A greater number of capillaries also allows for greater oxygen exchange in the network. This is vitally important to endurance training, because it allows a person to continue training for an extended period of time. However, no experimental evidence suggests that increased <b>capillarity</b> is required in endurance exercise to increase the maximum oxygen delivery.|$|E
25|$|E. imperialis can be {{identified}} from other bees by its relatively large size and relatively sparse hairs, which expose their brightly metallic color. Males have conspicuous white marks around the mouth, whereas similar markings are diminutive in females. Males also have a broad hind tibia, rhomboid or triangular in shape and rounded distally, used as a storage organ for aromatic materials. Male forelegs have five tarsal segments, which have dense tufts of hairs (or ‘brushes’) on the ventral surface, that are useful for picking up oily liquids by <b>capillarity.</b> An elongated pit covered by long hairs (a ‘scar’) {{can also be seen}} on the outer rear surface of the tibia, which shows two lobes, each of which has an opening into the tibial organ. The wall of the tibial organ is extremely wrinkled, on which the inner surface has many large branched hairs. Males also display a characteristic pattern of short, dense hairs on the outer surface of the mid tibia, with one or two small hairy patches within a much larger patch. All E. imperialis are known to have relatively long tongues in comparison to other bee species. They also have two widely separated tufts of hair without any obvious tubes or slits on the second (metasomal) sternum.|$|E

For the multiphase equilibria, {{the results of the}} van der Waals approach practically coincide with the Gibbs formulae, but for modelling of the dynamics of phase transitions the van der Waals approach is much more convenient. The van der Waals <b>capillarity</b> energy is now widely used in the phase field models of multiphase flows. Such terms are also discovered in the dynamics of non-equilibrium gases.|$|E
500|$|In 1900, Einstein's paper [...] "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen" [...] ("Conclusions {{from the}} <b>Capillarity</b> Phenomena") was {{published}} in the journal Annalen der Physik. On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed his thesis, with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics, serving as pro-forma advisor. As a result, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich, with his dissertation [...] "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions".|$|E
500|$|Einstein's first paper {{submitted}} in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. It {{was published}} in 1901 with the title [...] "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", which translates as [...] "Conclusions from the <b>capillarity</b> phenomena". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were {{the foundation for the}} 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.|$|E
500|$|At liquid–air interfaces, {{surface tension}} {{results from the}} greater {{attraction}} of liquid molecules to each other (due to cohesion) than to the molecules in the air (due to adhesion). The net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes the liquid to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane. Thus, the surface becomes under tension from the imbalanced forces, which is probably where the term [...] "surface tension" [...] came from. Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules for each other through a web of hydrogen bonds, water has a higher surface tension (72.8 millinewtons per meter at 20°C) {{compared to that of}} most other liquids. Surface tension {{is an important factor in}} the phenomenon of <b>capillarity.</b>|$|E

[...] Between 1658 and 1661 Thévenot conducted experiments on <b>capillarity</b> and the siphon. [...] He proposed the use of lemon juice as a cure for various maladies, as well as ipecac as a remedy for dysentery.|$|E
2500|$|The Navier–Stokes {{equations}} {{assume that}} the fluid being studied is a continuum (it is infinitely divisible and not composed of particles such as atoms or molecules), and is not moving at relativistic velocities. At very small scales or under extreme conditions, real fluids made out of discrete molecules will produce results different from the continuous fluids modeled by the Navier–Stokes equations. For example, <b>capillarity</b> of internal layers in fluids appears for flow with high gradients. [...] For large Knudsen number of the problem, the Boltzmann equation may be a suitable replacement.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{contribution}} to smallpox vaccination {{was made in}} the 1960s by Benjamin Rubin, an American microbiologist working for Wyeth Laboratories. Based on initial tests with textile needles with the eyes cut off transversely half-way he developed the bifurcated needle. This was a sharpened two-prong fork designed to hold one dose of reconstituted freeze-dried vaccine by <b>capillarity.</b> Easy to use with minimum training, cheap to produce ($5 per 1000), using 4 times less vaccine than other methods, and repeatedly re-usable after flame sterilization, it was used globally in the WHO Smallpox Eradication Campaign from 1968. Rubin estimated that it was used to do 200 million vaccinations per year during the last years of the campaign. Those closely involved in the campaign were awarded the [...] "Order of the Bifurcated Needle". This, a personal initiative by Donald Henderson, was a lapel badge, designed and made by his daughter, formed from the needle shaped to form an [...] "O". This represented [...] "Target Zero", the objective of the campaign.|$|E

This must, in portable barometers, in very dry weather, be kept moist with a sponge. A small iron bottle of pure mercury to supply leakage should be supplied with every barometer, as also a turnscrew. The vernier plate and scale should be screwed, not soldered on the metal sheath, as if an escape occurs in the barometer-case the solder is acted upon at once. A table of corrections for capacity and <b>capillarity</b> should accompany every instrument, and simple directions, etc., in cases of trifling derangement, and alteration of neutral point.|$|E

I have seen boys about the streets, who are very anxious to appear like men, {{take a piece of}} cane, and light it and smoke it, as an imitation of a cigar. They are enabled to do so by the permeability of the cane in one direction, and by its <b>capillarity.</b> If I place this piece of cane on a plate containing some camphin (which is very much like paraffin in its general character), exactly {{in the same manner as}} the blue fluid rose through the salt will this fluid rise through the piece of cane. There being no pores at the side, the fluid cannot go in that direction, but must pass through its length. Already the fluid is at the top of the cane: now I can light it and make it serve as a candle. The fluid has risen by the capillary attraction of the piece of cane, just as it does through the cotton in the candle.|$|E

The {{power or}} force which makes {{combustible}} gas or vapour abandon its elastic state {{in contact with}} a solid, that it may cover the latter with a thin stratum of its own proper substance, is considered as being neither attraction nor affinity. It is able also to extend liquids and solids in concrete laminæ {{over the surface of}} the acting solid body, and consists in a repulsion, which is developed from the parts of the solid body by the simple fact of attenuation, and is highest when the attenuation is most complete. The force has a progressive development, and acts most powerfully, or at first, in the direction in which the dimensions of the attenuated mass decrease, and then {{in the direction of the}} angles or corners which from any cause may exist on the surface. This force not only causes spontaneous diffusion of gases and other substances over the surface, but is considered as very elementary in its nature, and competent to account for all the phenomena of <b>capillarity,</b> chemical affinity, attraction of aggregation, rarefaction, ebullition, volatilization, explosion, and other thermometric effects, as well as inflammation, detonation, &c. &c. It is considered as a form of heat to which the term native calorie is given, and is still further viewed as the principle of the two electricities and the two magnetisms.|$|E
