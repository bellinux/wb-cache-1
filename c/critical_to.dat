5|$|As {{the species}} has no fixed nest sites that {{individuals}} {{can use to}} locate their own partner or chick, emperor penguins must rely on vocal calls alone for identification. They use {{a complex set of}} calls that are <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> individual recognition between parents, offspring, and mates, displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguins. Vocalizing emperor penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.|$|E

What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation.|$|E
5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The Ethics of Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria {{because it can}} be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human freedom as <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> the moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E
5|$|Hinde {{became a}} circuit rider {{in the early}} 1800s. While his circuit varied over the years, he served large {{portions}} of Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri. Much of the territory he covered was generally lawless, violent and dangerous. Circuit riders served numerous churches and were supposed to plant new ones in new or underserved communities. They were <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> {{the development of the}} frontier.|$|E

By considering the interdependencies of the critical infrastructure sectors, it will be shown how all critical infrastructures can be modelled as information infrastructures when considering information warfare attacks. </p...|$|R
5|$|In his magisterial three-volume Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion (1772–74), Priestley {{outlined}} {{his theories}} of religious instruction.

This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that is <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> understanding his later writings—it {{paved the way for}} his materialism and necessitarianism (the belief that a divine being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws).|$|E
5|$|In {{the form}} {{trivalent}} chromium, Cr(III), or Cr3+, chromium {{was identified as}} an essential nutrient in the late 1950s and later accepted as a trace element for its roles in the action of insulin, a hormone <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> the metabolism and storage of carbohydrate, fat and protein. The precise mechanism of its actions in the body, however, have not been fully defined, leaving in question whether chromium is essential for healthy people.|$|E

5|$|Phosphorylation: cTnI was {{the first}} sarcomeric protein {{identified}} to be a substrate of PKA. Phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser23/Ser24 under adrenergic stimulation enhances relaxation of cardiac muscle, which is <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> cardiac function especially at fast heart rate. Whereas PKA phosphorylation of Ser23/Ser24 decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and increases relaxation, phosphorylation of Ser42/Ser44 by PKC increases Ca2+ sensitivity and decreases cardiac muscle relaxation. Ser5/Ser6, Tyr26, Thr31, Ser39, Thr51, Ser77, Thr78, Thr129, Thr143 and Ser150 are also phosphorylation sites in human cTnI.|$|E

The French also ultimately understood {{that in order to}} quell the revolt in Syria they needed to offer concessions in Anatolia and establish cooperation with the Turks, whose financial, military and moral support was <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> the rebels. When truces were reached with the Turks, the French redeployed large numbers of troops from the Anatolian front to suppress the rebels in Syria.|$|E

5|$|The formal {{patterns}} of meter used in Modern English verse to create rhythm no longer dominate contemporary English poetry. In {{the case of}} free verse, rhythm is often organized based on looser units of cadence rather than a regular meter. Robinson Jeffers, Marianne Moore, and William Carlos Williams are three notable poets who reject the idea that regular accentual meter is <b>critical</b> <b>to</b> English poetry. Jeffers experimented with sprung rhythm {{as an alternative to}} accentual rhythm.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of two methods of instruction on secondary school students’ <b>critical</b> response <b>to</b> Prose Literature text. The study adopted a pretest, posttest, control group quasi experimental design. The {{participants in the study}} were 84 Senior Secondary II students of Literature-in-English purposively selected from four Schools in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of Edo State. Two intact classes were randomly assigned to each of the treatment and control groups. Three hypotheses were tested at 0. 05 alpha level. The instruments used were: <b>Critical</b> Response <b>to</b> Prose Literature Test (r =. 75), Questionnaire on Home Background of Students (r =. 82), and <b>Critical</b> Response <b>to</b> Prose Literature Test Marking Guide. Data obtained were subjected to Analysis of Covariance and graph. The results showed significant main effect of treatment on students’ <b>critical</b> response <b>to</b> Prose Literature (F (1, 77) = 44. 731; p <. 05). Students exposed to Engagement Strategies Method performed better than those exposed to the Conventional Method of instruction. Further, home background of students had no significant effect on students’ <b>critical</b> response <b>to</b> Prose Literature text (F (2, 77) = 4. 902; p <. 05). There was significant interaction effect of treatment and home background of students on students’ <b>critical</b> response <b>to</b> Prose Literature text (F (2, 77) = 3. 508; p <. 05). It was concluded that Engagement Strategies Method is effective in promoting students’ <b>critical</b> response <b>to</b> Prose Literature text. Teachers of Literature-in-English should employ Engagement Strategies Method in teaching Prose Literature to students in Senior Secondary Schools...|$|R
