40|$|A {{crucial role}} of {{segmental}} duplications (SDs) {{of the human}} genome has been shown in chromosomal rearrangements associated with several genomic disorders. Limited knowledge is yet available on the molecular processes resulting in chromosomal rearrangements in tumors. The t(9; 22) (q 34;q 11) rearrangement causing the 5 'BCR/ 3 'ABL gene formation has been detected in more than 90 % of cases with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In 10 - 18 % of patients with CML, genomic deletions were detected on der(9) chromosome next to translocation breakpoints. The molecular mechanism triggering the t(9; 22) and deletions on der(9) is still speculative. Here we report a molecular cytogenetic analysis of a large series of patients with CML with der(9) deletions, revealing an evident breakpoint clustering in two regions located proximally to ABL and distally to BCR, containing an interchromosomal duplication block (SD_ 9 / 22). The deletions breakpoints distribution appeared to be strictly related to the distance from the SD_ 9 / 22. Moreover, bioinformatic analyses of the regions surrounding the SD_ 9 / 22 revealed a high Alu frequency and a poor gene density, reflecting genomic instability and susceptibility to rearrangements.

FRA 6 E {{is one of the}} most frequently expressed common fragile sites of the human genome. It harbours several genes, PARK 2 being regarded as the most relevant one. According to the results obtained from interphase FISH analysis, FRA 6 E can be considered a mid-late-replicating sequence characterised by heterogeneous replication timing. Molecular combing did not reveal specific replication parameters at the fragile site: fork rates were highly comparable to those detected at an early replicating locus (LMNB 2) used as control and in very good agreement with the whole-genome data obtained in parallel. The same indication applied to the density of initiation zones, the inter-origin distances from adjacent ongoing forks, the frequencies of unidirectional forks, fork arrest events and asynchronous forks. Interestingly, PARK 2 appeared embedded in an early/late replication transition zone, corresponding to intron 8 (162 kb) and to the fragility core of FRA 6 E. In cells exposed to aphidicolin, few forks progressing at a rather slow rate were observed, the majority of them being unidirectional, but again a specific response of the fragile site was not observed. In summary, at FRA 6 E the replication process is not impaired per se, but <b>chromosome</b> <b>breakages</b> occur preferentially at an early/late replication transition zone. Aphidicolin might increase the occurrence of breakage events at FRA 6 E by prolonging the time interval separating the replication of early and late replication domains.
