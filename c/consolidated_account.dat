The 2007 guidance focused on specific MMR, rather than dollar magnitude in determining the scope and sufficiency of evidence to be obtained at decentralized units. The interpretation (common under the pre-2007 guidance) that a unit or group of units was material and therefore {{a large number of}} controls across multiple processes require testing irrespective of risk, has been superseded. Where account balances from single units or groups of similar units are a material portion of the <b>consolidated</b> <b>account</b> balance, management should carefully consider whether MMR may exist in a particular unit. Testing focused on just the controls related to the MMR should then be performed.

5000|$|While the Permanent Fund {{generally}} generated large surpluses {{even after}} payment of the Dividend PFD, the state general fund operated at a substantial deficit. However, the <b>consolidated</b> <b>account</b> of both General and Permanent Funds usually shows a surplus. The Funds' ultimate uses were never clearly spelled out at its inception, leaving no current consensus over what role Fund earning should {{play in the}} current and expected state budget shortfalls. However, some people argue that the original intent was to fund state government after the temporary oil riches ceased, while others note that the Fund's intent changed from its 1976 origin when in 1982 the Dividend program began. Public opinion strongly favors the Dividend program. Indeed, in 1999, with oil prices going as low as $9 per barrel and Alaska's oil consultant Daniel Yergin forecasting low prices [...] "for the foreseeable future", the State put an advisory vote before Alaskans, asking if government could spend [...] "some" [...] part of Permanent Fund earning for government purposes. Gov. Knowles, Lt. Gov. Ulmer, and many other elected officials urged a [...] "yes" [...] vote. Campaign spending greatly favored the [...] "yes" [...] side. The public voted [...] "no" [...] by nearly 84%. (Oil prices rose dramatically, starting about two weeks after Yergin's prediction, to above $60 per barrel, though the quantity produced continues to fall.) Perceived support of the dividend program is so universally strong that it ensures the dividend's continuity {{and the protection of}} the Fund's principal, since any measure characterized as negatively impacting dividend payouts represents a loss to the entire populace. That is, legislators willing to appropriate the Fund's annual earnings are constrained by the politically suicidal nature of any decrease in the public's dividend.|$|E

We find that those firms which adopted <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounting</b> early reported a significantly better change in reported performance at the time of adoption than those firms which only consolidated when required to do so.

The author brings the three components of the Greek canon most important to Freud - myth, tragedy and philosophy – into dialogue with psychoanalysis to show the importance of their influence on Freud's ideas on temporality.

The study, Consolidated Balance sheets, income from business groups was presented at the annual conference of the National Society of Accountants in Dijon in 1954, will be widely quoted and discussed in the professional literature until 1964. This paper seeks to highlight the genesis of this seminal text on the <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounts.</b> Richard and Veyrenc where did they get their inspiration?

In order to observe, in a scientific manner, this evolution of the accounting standards, we conducted a content analysis of principal legislative accounting texts, international and national (France and Romania), supplemented by a lexicometric analysis.
