To this aim, a kind of <b>calibration</b> <b>step</b> {{has been added to}} the described methodology. In particular, the calibration concerns two parameters for describing the area constraints in the segmentation phase (Section 3.2) and two parameters for describing the shape constraints in the validation phase (Section 3.4). The goal of the <b>calibration</b> <b>step</b> is to find out a configuration of such parameters that minimizes the differences between the results gathered by the automatic procedure and those obtained with the human judgements in terms of orientation, length, and width for the considered brushstrokes. In this way, the outcomes of the <b>calibration</b> <b>step</b> drive the choice of the constraints and influence the brushstrokes extraction procedure.|$|R

Once at STScI, the data are processed by a series of computer algorithms that convert its format into an internationally accepted standard (known as FITS: Flexible Image Transport System), correct for missing data, and perform final calibration of the data by removing instrumental artifacts. The <b>calibration</b> <b>steps</b> are different for each HST instrument, but as a general rule they include cosmic ray removal, correction for instrument/detector non-uniformities, flux calibration, and application of world coordinate system information (which tells the user precisely where on the sky the detector was pointed).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a dynamic multivariate jump driven model in a credit setting.

The parameters of the model come from a two <b>step</b> <b>calibration</b> procedure. First, a joint calibration on swaptions on the spreads is performed and second, a correlation matching procedure is applied. For the first <b>calibration</b> <b>step,</b> we make use of equity-like pricing formulas for payer and receiver swaptions, based on the characteristic function and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method. In the second <b>calibration</b> <b>step,</b> we fix the correlation in the model to match the prescribed (in casu historically observed) correlation. This can be done fast since a closed form expression is readily available. The resulting jump driven dynamic model generates correlated spreads very fast. This model can be used to price a whole range of exotic structures. We illustrate this by pricing the currently popular credit Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) structures. Because of the built in jump dynamics a better assessment of gap risk is possible. 2...|$|R
