However, there are no similar studies between long-term <b>climate</b> <b>cycles</b> and estuarine species. In this study, barramundi (Lates calcarifer) landings as recorded by the Fish Board across north-east Queensland were found to be significantly correlated with an index of the Quasi-biennial Oscillation at lags of three to four years and the latitude of the sub-tropical ridge one to four years prior to catch. These results indicate that long-term <b>climate</b> <b>cycles</b> may affect the early life cycle stages of the species by influencing climate variables such as rainfall, stream flow and temperature and hence nutrient availability and nursery habitat suitability.

The emergence of climatic geomorphology was foreshadowed by the work of Wladimir Köppen, Vasily Dokuchaev and Andreas Schimper. William Morris Davis, the leading geomorphologist of his time, recognized the role of climate by complementing his [...] "normal" [...] temperate <b>climate</b> <b>cycle</b> of erosion with arid and glacial ones. Nevertheless, interest in climatic geomorphology was also a reaction against Davisian geomorphology that was by the mid-20th century considered both un-innovative and dubious.

5000|$|Hurricane Katrina and {{shrinkage}} of New Orleans {{had significant}} effects on various {{groups in the}} city. African Americans, renters, the elderly, and people with low income were disproportionately impacted by Hurricane Katrina compared to affluent and white residents. First, African Americans {{are less likely to}} have rental and homeowner's insurance and to have insurance with major companies as compared to whites, which is related to practices of racially based insurance redlining. Since people of color were more likely to rely on public transportation, the dependence of the evacuation on personal transportation impacted these individuals more than those with personal means to leave the area. Some academics highlight this disparity as an issue of climate injustice, which is the differential impact of climate change on certain groups, as scientists have shown that increases in activity of Atlantic hurricanes [...] "are believed to reflect, in large part, contemporaneous increases in tropical Atlantic warmth...and have attributed these increases to a natural <b>climate</b> <b>cycle</b> termed the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), while other studies suggest that climate change may instead be playing the dominant role." ...|$|E
