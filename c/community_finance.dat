Montgomery Jr. and others, who {{were charged with}} using blind pools operated by the <b>Community</b> <b>Finance</b> Corporation to defraud $3,000,000 through mail fraud. Austin H. Montgomery Jr. and William L. Cunningham were charged in February 1923 for their connection with the bankrupt <b>Community</b> <b>Finance</b> Corporation. [...] Others indicted in the same case included John A. Berryman, for using the mails to defraud investors in connection with Fidelity Finance Company. For selling securities in a similar operation to <b>Community</b> <b>Finance</b> Corporation, Berryman surrendered to Peter J. McCoy in August 1923. In September 1923, after being accused of a $6,000,000 blind pool deal concerning the <b>Community</b> <b>Finance</b> Corporation, Montgomery was found in Quebec, Canada.|$|E

40|$|In {{the face}} of severe {{resource}} shortages, <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> is increasingly being promoted as an alternative source of finance for public health providers. Non-government organisations have long-standing experience of <b>community</b> <b>financing,</b> {{but there is little}} documentation of the range of approaches. In this review, a sample of twenty NGOs was studied to explore these experiences. The range of approaches adopted by different organisations and the information available regarding success in achieving financial sustainability are described. Two preconditions for successful <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> (in this sense) are suggested by the evidence: collection of relevant background data relating to the proposed site of the <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> programme, and consultation with the community. The Health Economics and Financing Programme is supported by the Overseas Development Administration.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> mechanisms can raise additional revenue, increase equitable access to {{primary health care}} (PHC), and improve social protection. More recently there has been interest in scaling up <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> as a step towards universal coverage either via tax-based systems or social health insurance. Using key informant interviews and focus group discussions, this study sought to assess the desirability and feasibility of scaling-up community health insurance in Armenia. The results {{suggest that there is}} broad-based political support for scaling up the schemes and that <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> is synergistic with major health sector reforms. High levels of social capital within the rural communities should facilitate scaling up. Existing schemes have increased access and quality of care, but expansion of coverage is constrained by affordability, poor infrastructure, and weak linkages with the broader health system. Long-term subsidies and system-building will be essential if the expanded schemes are to be financially viable and pro-poor. Overall, successfully scaling up <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> in Armenia would depend on addressing a range of obstacles related to legislation, institutional capacity, human resources and resistance to change among certain stakeholders.

50|$|In 2012, London Mutual Credit Union {{became the}} first British credit union to offer payday loans. The initial 12 months trial for {{short-term}} payday loans was completed in 2013. The scheme {{was funded by the}} Friends Provident Foundation and the Barclays <b>Community</b> <b>Finance</b> Fund, with project support from the Financial Inclusion Centre. The pilot payday loan received 6,087 applications for an average loan of £238. In the 12-month pilot, 2,923 short-term loans with a value of £687,757 were provided to 1,219 different borrowers. Under the scheme, borrowers could take out a payday loan or spread out repayment over a longer period. 29% of applicants repaid their loan in one month, while 59% of applicants opted to repay their loan over three months. However, in a survey, 66% of applicants said their main reason for taking out a loan with London Mutual was the low cost of borrowing compared to other payday lenders. Only 10% said that the option to repay {{over a longer period of}} time was their main reason for choosing the credit union.|$|E
40|$|Abstract How {{to finance}} and {{provide health care}} for the more than 1. 3 billion rural poor and {{informal}} sector workers in low- and middle-income countries {{is one of the greatest}} challenges facing the international development community. This article presents the main findings from an extensive survey of the literature of <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> arrangements, and selected experiences from the Asia and Africa regions. Most <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> schemes have evolved in the context of severe economic constraints, political instability, and lack of good governance. Micro-level household data analysis indicates that <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> improves access by rural and informal sector workers to needed heath care and provides them with some financial protection against the cost of illness. Macro-level cross-country analysis gives empirical support to the hypothesis that risk-sharing in health financing matters in terms of its impact on both the level and distribution of health, financial fairness and responsiveness indicators. The background research done for this article points to five key policies available to governments to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of existing <b>community</b> <b>financing</b> schemes. This includes: (a) increased and well-targeted subsidies to pay for the premiums of low-income populations; (b) insurance to protect against expenditure fluctuations and re-insurance to enlarge the effective size of small risk pools; (c) effective prevention and case management techniques to limit expenditure fluctuations; (d) technical support to strengthen the management capacity of local schemes; and (e) establishment and strengthening of links with the formal financing an...|$|R

40|$|The {{working paper}} offers a {{conceptual}} basis for action research on internal controls in <b>community</b> <b>finance</b> institutions (CFIs) in rural Cambodia.

A related barrier is the reluctance of poor people to assert their rights â€“ a reluctance compounded by functional illiteracy. The paper works within a shareholder rights framework to building institutions. It makes the case that practitioners must be much more aware of the control needs â€“ and the information management needs [...] of shareholders in predominantly oral societies. Given that awareness, it makes the case that REFLECT â€˜literacy circlesâ€™ can be adapted effectively to improving the quality of CFIs.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a strategy}} for financing health services in sub-Saharan Africa. The individual components of the strategy are as follows: general tax revenues, international finance, a system of user charges, <b>community</b> <b>finance,</b> health insurance, and contributions from nongovernmental organizations, including the private sector. The author states that financial positions of public health care systems in sub-Saharan Africa would be greatly enhanced if governments in the region were to adopt policies that would use each of the above sources of finance. Since a strong financial base {{is a prerequisite for}} an effective health care system, such policies would considerably improve the health status of the population.
