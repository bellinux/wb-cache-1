40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the common refractive disorders among patients in the Jos University Teaching Hospital, Jos, Nigeria. A total of 808 eyes were examined for refractive anomalies. 666 (82. 4 %) of the eyes had refractive anomalies. Hyperopia was found in 360 (44. 6 %) eyes. Myopia in 234 (28. 9 %) eyes and Astigmatism in 277 (34. 43 %) eyes. Further analysis revealed {{that out of the}} 234 myopic eyes; 124 (52. 9 %) had low myopia, 13 (5. 6 %) had high myopia and 97 (41. 5 %) had <b>clinically</b> less <b>significant</b> myopia. High hyperopia was found in 44 eyes and 239 eyes had <b>clinically</b> less <b>significant</b> hyperopia.

5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common <b>clinically</b> <b>significant</b> congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E
5|$|A {{supply of}} easily {{accessible}} uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices {{are important for}} reducing rates of infection and <b>clinically</b> <b>significant</b> gastroenteritis. Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) {{have been found to}} decrease rates of gastroenteritis in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective.|$|E
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no <b>clinically</b> <b>significant</b> delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E

5|$|Obesity and {{metabolic}} syndrome are both {{closely related to}} plasma triglyceride levels. Therefore, the focus on an association between APOA5 and BMI or {{metabolic syndrome}} is understandable. Available studies show that minor APOA5 alleles could be associated with an enhanced risk of obesity or metabolic syndrome development. However, genome wide studies have failed to prove that APOA5 is a gene associated with BMI values and/or obesity, so the effect could be far from <b>clinically</b> <b>significant</b> or at least significantly context-dependent.|$|E
5|$|The fetal {{hypothalamus}} and pituitary {{start to}} secrete thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is first measurable at 11 weeks. By 18â€“20 weeks, {{the production of}} thyroxine (T4) reaches a <b>clinically</b> <b>significant</b> and self-sufficient level. Fetal triiodothyronine (T3) remains low, less than 15ng/dL until 30 weeks, and increases to 50ng/dL at full-term. The fetus needs to be self-sufficient in thyroid hormones in order to guard against neurodevelopmental disorders that would arise from maternal hypothyroidism. The presence of sufficient iodine is essential for healthy neurodevelopment.|$|E
5|$|Familial dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} systolic heart failure (prevalence 1:5000). A wider range of mutations (including some non-sarcomeric proteins as well) is associated with DCM. The cTnC mutations associated with DCM thus far are Y5H, Q50R, D75Y, M103I, D145E (also associated with HCM), I148V, and G159D. Of these, Q50R and G159D co-segregated with disease in affected family members, increasing confidence that they are <b>clinically</b> <b>significant</b> mutations. The biochemical consequences of thin filament DCM-associated mutations are less well established than for HCM, {{although there has been}} some suggestion that some of the mutations abolish the calcium desensitizing effect of cTnI phosphorylation at Ser22/23. This may be because some mutations disrupt the precise positioning of cNTnC for triggering muscle contraction when cTnI is unphosphorylated.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} risk {{and severity of}} serotonergic side effects and serotonin toxicity, with individual drugs and combinations, is complex. Serotonin syndrome {{has been reported in}} patients of all ages, including the elderly, children, and even newborn infants due to in utero exposure. The serotonergic toxicity of SSRIs increases with dose, but even in over-dose it is insufficient to cause fatalities from serotonin syndrome in healthy adults. Elevations of central nervous system serotonin will typically only reach potentially fatal levels when drugs with different mechanisms of action are mixed together. Various drugs, other than SSRIs, also have <b>clinically</b> <b>significant</b> potency as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, (e.g. tramadol, amphetamine, and MDMA) and are associated with severe cases of the syndrome.|$|E

25|$|A {{positive}} screen warrants an antibody panel/investigation {{to determine}} if it is <b>clinically</b> <b>significant.</b> An antibody panel consists of commercially prepared group O red cell suspensions from donors that have been phenotyped for antigens that correspond to commonly encountered and <b>clinically</b> <b>significant</b> alloantibodies. Donor cells may have homozygous (e.g. K+kâˆ’), heterozygous (K+k+) expression or no expression of various antigens (Kâˆ’kâˆ’). The phenotypes of all the donor cells being tested are shown in a chart. The patient's serum is tested against the various donor cells. Based on the reactions of the patient's serum against the donor cells, a pattern will emerge to confirm the presence {{of one or more}} antibodies. Not all antibodies are <b>clinically</b> <b>significant</b> (i.e. cause transfusion reactions, HDN, etc.). Once the patient has developed a <b>clinically</b> <b>significant</b> antibody it is vital that the patient receive antigen-negative red blood cells to prevent future transfusion reactions. A direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) is also performed as part of the antibody investigation.|$|E
