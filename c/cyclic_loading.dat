25|$|The {{resistance}} of the cohesionless soil to liquefaction {{will depend on the}} density of the soil, confining stresses, soil structure (fabric, age and cementation), the magnitude and duration of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading,</b> {{and the extent to which}} shear stress reversal occurs.|$|E
25|$|Depending on {{the initial}} void ratio, the soil {{material}} can respond to loading either strain-softening or strain-hardening. Strain-softened soils, e.g. loose sands, can be triggered to collapse, either monotonically or cyclically, if the static shear stress {{is greater than the}} ultimate or steady-state shear strength of the soil. In this case flow liquefaction occurs, where the soil deforms at a low constant residual shear stress. If the soil strain-hardens, e.g. moderately dense to dense sand, flow liquefaction will generally not occur. However, cyclic softening can occur due to cyclic undrained loading, e.g. earthquake loading. Deformation during <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> will depend on the density of the soil, the magnitude and duration of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading,</b> and amount of shear stress reversal. If stress reversal occurs, the effective shear stress could reach zero, then cyclic liquefaction can take place. If stress reversal does not occur, zero effective stress is not possible to occur, then cyclic mobility takes place.|$|E
25|$|The term 'cyclic mobility' {{refers to}} the {{mechanism}} of progressive reduction of effective stress due to <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading.</b> This may occur in all soil types including dense soils. However, on reaching a state of zero effective stress such soils immediate dilate and regain strength. Thus shear strains are significantly less than a true state of soil liquefaction whereby a loose soil exhibits flow type phenomena.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a finite-element {{model is}} {{developed}} {{in which the}} nonlinear soil behavior is represented by a hyperbolic relation for static load condition and modified hyperbolic relation, which includes both degradation and gap for a <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> condition. Although batter piles are subjected to lateral load, the soil resistance is also governed by axial load, which is incorporated by considering the P-Δ moment and geometric stiffness matrix. By adopting the developed numerical model, static and <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> analyses are performed adopting an incremental-iterative procedure where the pile is idealized as beam elements and the soil as elastoplastic spring elements. The proposed numerical model is validated with published laboratory and field pile test results under both static and <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> conditions.

25|$|A 'flow failure' may {{initiate}} if {{the strength}} of the soil is reduced below the stresses required to maintain equilibrium of a slope or footing of a building for instance. This can occur due to monotonic loading or <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading,</b> and can be sudden and catastrophic. A historical example is the Aberfan disaster. Casagrande referred to this type of phenomena as 'flow liquefaction' although a state of zero effective stress is not required for this to occur.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue {{is defined}} as failure of a {{material}} due to repeated/cyclic loading or unloading (tensile or compressive stresses). It {{is also an important}} parameter for biomaterial because cyclic load is applied during their serving life. In this <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> condition, micro crack/flaws may be generated at the interface of the matrix and the filler. This micro crack can initiate permanent plastic deformation which results in large crack propagation or failure. During the cyclic load several factor also contribute to microcrack generation such as frictional sliding of the mating surface, progressive wear, residual stresses at grain boundaries, stress due to shear.|$|E
25|$|A {{state of}} 'soil liquefaction' {{occurs when the}} {{effective}} stress of soil is reduced to essentially zero, which corresponds to a complete loss of shear strength. This may be initiated by either monotonic loading (e.g. single sudden occurrence {{of a change in}} stress – examples include an increase in load on an embankment or sudden loss of toe support) or <b>cyclic</b> <b>loading</b> (e.g. repeated change in stress condition – examples include wave loading or earthquake shaking). In both cases a soil in a saturated loose state, and one which may generate significant pore water pressure on a change in load are the most likely to liquefy. This is because a loose soil has the tendency to compress when sheared, generating large excess porewater pressure as load is transferred from the soil skeleton to adjacent pore water during undrained loading. As pore water pressure rises a progressive loss of strength of the soil occurs as effective stress is reduced.|$|E
40|$|Lightly stabilised {{granular}} {{materials with}} cementitious binders are generally characterised by their stiffness modulus and this paper examines {{the use of}} monotonic and <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> indirect diametrical tensile (IDT) testing to determine the stiffness characteristics of these materials.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new Linear Matching Method (LMM) technique for the direct evaluation of ratchet limit of structure {{subjected to a}} general <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> condition, which can be decomposed into cyclic and constant components. The <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> history considered in the paper contains multi-load extremes to include most complicated practical applications. The numerical procedure is described which uses LMM state-of-the-art numerical technique to obtain a stable cyclic state of component, followed by a LMM shakedown analysis, to calculate the maximum constant load, i. e. the ratchet limit, which indicates the load carrying capacity of the structure subjected to <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> condition to withstand an additional constant load. This approach is particularly useful {{in conjunction with the}} evaluation of the stable cyclic response, which produces the cyclic stresses, residual stresses and plastic strain ranges for the low cycle fatigue assessment. A benchmark example of holed plate under the combined action of <b>cyclic</b> thermal <b>load</b> and constant mechanical load is presented to verify the applicability of the new ratchet limit method, through the comparison with published results by a simplified method assuming a <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> with two extremes. To demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the method for complicated <b>cyclic</b> <b>load</b> condition with multi-load extremes, a composite thick cylinder with radial opening subjected to <b>cyclic</b> thermal <b>loads</b> and constant internal pressure is analyzed using the proposed ratchet limit method. The further verification by the Abaqus step-by-step inelastic analysis demonstrates that the proposed new method provides a general-purpose technique for the evaluation of ratchet limit, and has both the advantages of programming methods and the capacity to be implemented easily within a commercial finite element code Abaqus...|$|R
