40|$|We {{make three}} points in {{response}} to Boyce, Daly, Hounkpatin, and Wood (2017). First, we <b>clarify</b> <b>a</b> <b>misunderstanding</b> of the goal of our analyses, which {{was to investigate the}} links between life satisfaction and spending patterns, rather than spending volume. Second, we report a simulation study we ran to demonstrate that our results were not driven by the proposed statistical artifact. Finally, we discuss the broader issue of why, in a world of big data, small but reliable effect sizes can be valuable...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of deep {{sub-micron}} (DSM) era, floorplanning has become increasingly important in physical design process. In this paper we <b>clarify</b> <b>a</b> <b>misunderstanding</b> in using Lagrangian relaxation for the minimum area floorplanning problem. We show {{that the problem is}} not convex and its optimal solution cannot be obtained by solving its Lagrangian dual problem. We then propose a modified convex formulation and solve it using min-cost flow technique and trust region method. Experimental results under module aspect ratio bound [0. 5, 2. 0] show that the running time of our floorplanner scales well with the problem size in MCNC benchmark. Compared with the floorplanner in [27], our floorplanner is 9. 5 X faster for the largest case “ami 49 ”. It also generates a floorplan with smaller deadspace for almost all test cases. In addition, since the generated floorplan has an aspect ratio closer to 1, it is more friendly to packaging. Our floorplanner is also amicable to including interconnect cost and other physical design metrics...|$|E

This translation will allow matters to be set straight concerning a number of fundamental theoretical issues connected to Stackelberg’s work as well as allow to <b>clarify</b> <b>a</b> number of <b>misunderstandings</b> that go back to the first reviews of Stackelberg’s 1934 classic on competition theory...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} in a quantum measurement, the {{preferred}} basis {{is determined by the}} interaction between the apparatus and the quantum system, instead of by the environment. This interaction entangles three degrees of freedom, one system degree of freedom we are interested in and preserved by the interaction, one system degree of freedom that carries the change due to the interaction, and the apparatus degree of freedom which is always ignored. Considering all three degrees of freedom the composite state only has one decomposition, and this guarantees that the apparatus would end up in the expected preferred basis of our daily experiences. We also point out some problems with the environment-induced super-selection (Einselection) solution to the preferred basis problem, and <b>clarifies</b> <b>a</b> common <b>misunderstanding</b> of environmental decoherence and the preferred basis problem.

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the editorial by Sparacino-Watkins et al 1 that accompanied our recent article 2 demonstrating the beneficial effects of dietary inorganic nitrate supplementation in experimental models of pulmonary hypertension (PH). The editorial provides a timely overview of the scientific rationale for exploiting the recently characterized nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway in PH and other car-diovascular disorders. We agree {{with the authors that}} a therapeutic approach based on this pathway represents an exciting new avenue for a debilitating disease with very poor outcome. However, we wish to <b>clarify</b> <b>an</b> apparent <b>misunderstanding</b> regarding the dose required for efficacy in humans. Sparacino-Watkins et al suggest that the concentrations of nitrate (and nitrite) shown to prevent and reverse PH in our study are very high and unrealistic in terms of translation to the human condition. They extrapolate from the mouse to humans and intimate that a 70 -k...|$|R
40|$|In their {{letter to}} the editor, Grimsrud, Gallefoss, and Løchen (2012) criticize us for putting too little {{emphasis}} on the health hazards of snus in our study (Lund & Scheffels, 2012) and suggest that our scientific consensus that snus is much less harmful than cigarettes is faulty. Furthermore, they warn us {{about the risk of}} becoming useful tools for the tobacco industry and imply that we have been too selective in our choice of references. It seems timely for us to try and <b>clarify</b> <b>a</b> few <b>misunderstandings</b> in this respect. First, in our article, we do not recommend the use of snus in general. Instead, we suggest that snus might serve as an alternative to other cessation aids for highly nicotine-addicted or heavy smok-ers if other available aids fail to lead to smoking cessation. We do not claim that snus is risk free. The interesting question is, therefore, not whether the use of snus increases the risk for diseases in general or specific illnesses in particular, but rather how the risks from snu...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank the organisers for {{inviting}} me. I have known Charlie for a long time, and it is a great privilege to be given the opportunity to comment on this paper. Before moving on to substantive issues, it is important that I <b>clarify</b> <b>a</b> possible <b>misunderstanding</b> first. Essentially Charlie sets up a “straw man”, which he then sets about knocking down. Since Stephen Cecchetti, Hans Genberg and myself are associated with the “straw man ” view – you might call us the “straw men ” – it is obviously important that I set the record straight. Charlie repeatedly emphasises that, in a flexible inflation-targeting framework, if you look at the entire future path of expected inflation and growth, there is no independent role for asset prices. He asserts that we argue otherwise. To quote our paper: “It is also important to emphasise that our proposal is wholly consistent with the remit of inflation-targeting central banks, as we are recommending that while they might react to asset price misalignments, they must not target them”.

40|$|We {{comment on}} the recent paper by Azzalini et al. (2015) on two {{different}} distributions proposed in the literature for the modelling of data that have asymmetric and possibly long-tailed clusters. They {{are referred to as}} the restricted and unrestricted skew normal and skew t-distributions by Lee and McLachlan (2013 <b>a).</b> We <b>clarify</b> <b>an</b> apparent <b>misunderstanding</b> in Azzalini et al. (2015) of this nomenclature to distinguish between these two models. Also, we note that McLachlan and Lee (2014) have obtained improved results for the unrestricted model over those reported in Azzalini et al. (2015) for the two datasets that were analysed by them to form the basis of their claimson the relative superiority of the restricted and unrestricted models. On this matter of the relative superiority of these two models, Lee and McLachlan (2014 b, 2016) have shown how a distribution belonging to the broader class, the canonical fundamental skew t (CFUST) class, can be fitted with little additional computational effort than for the unrestricted distribution. The CFUST class includes the restricted and unrestricted distributions as special cases. Thus the user now has the option of letting the data decide as to which model is appropriate for their particular dataset...|$|R
30|$|The article aims to <b>clarify</b> <b>an</b> {{existing}} <b>misunderstanding</b> by {{the users}} of {{fetal bovine serum}} (FBS), who assume that certain countries, like Australia and New Zealand, have fewer cattle disease viruses and pose less risk {{for the presence of}} viruses, than do the other FBS producing countries. The article reviews the 2013 information from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), regarding the presence and absence of the 14 viruses of concern for FBS in the cattle populations of the 30 major FBS producing countries of the world. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and European Union (EU) regulations have identified 8 adventitious viruses and 6 additional viruses of importation concern that need to be tested for or eliminated in FBS, viruses that can cross the placental barrier from the donor cow to the fetus. A comparison is made regarding the number of viruses of concern reported presently in each of the FBS producing countries. The results of the comparison reveal that four Scandinavian countries report the fewest number of viruses of concern for FBS (six in total), while Australia and the USA are among the countries reporting the highest numbers of viruses of concern for FBS (ten in total). FBS from Australia and the USA has thus no advantage over the other FBS producing countries, regarding the number of viruses needed to be tested for and eliminated.|$|R
40|$|The weak {{natural law}} thesis asserts that any {{instance}} {{of law is}} either a rational standard for conduct or defective. At first glance, the thesis seems compatible with {{the proposition that the}} validity of a law within a legal system depends upon its sources rather than its merits. Mark C. Murphy has nonetheless argued that the weak natural law thesis can challenge this core commitment of legal positivism via an appeal to law’s function and defectiveness conditions. My contention in the current paper is that in order to make good on the challenge, the defender of the weak natural law thesis should appeal explicitly to the common good, understood as the principal normative reason in the political domain. In section I I outline the main implications of the weak natural law thesis and <b>clarify</b> <b>a</b> common <b>misunderstanding</b> regarding its explanatory role. Section II then argues for the indispensability of the common good to the natural law jurisprudential thesis {{on the grounds that it}} has an essential role to play in a natural law account of law’s defectiveness conditions and the presumptive moral obligatoriness of legal norms. Finally, in section III I examine the compatibility of a strengthened version of the weak natural law thesis with legal positivism in light of the centrality of the common good to the natural law jurisprudential position...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{builds on}} a {{previous}} work in which we attempted to retrieve a phylogenetic signal using abstract structural features alone, as opposed to cognate sets, drawn from a sample of Island Melanesian languages, both Oceanic (Austronesian) and (non-Austronesian) Papuan (Science 2005 [309]: 2072 - 75). Here we <b>clarify</b> <b>a</b> number of <b>misunderstandings</b> of this approach, referring particularly to the critique by Mark Donohue and Simon Musgrave (in this same issue of Oceanic Linguistics), in which they fail to appreciate the statistical principles underlying computational phylogenetic methods. We also present new analyses that provide stronger evidence supporting the hypotheses put forward in our original paper: a reanalysis using Bayesian phylogenetic inference demonstrates the robustness of the data and methods, and provides a substantial improvement over the parsimony method used in our earlier paper. We further demonstrate, using the technique of spatial autocorrelation, that neither proximity nor Oceanic contact can be {{a major determinant of}} the pattern of structural variation of the Papuan languages, and thus that the phylogenetic relatedness of the Papuan languages remains a serious hypothesis...|$|R
