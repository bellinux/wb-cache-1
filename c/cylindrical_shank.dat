50|$|The shank {{is the end}} of a {{drill bit}} grasped by the chuck of a drill. The cutting edges of the drill bit contact the workpiece, and are {{connected}} via the shaft with the shank, which fits into the chuck. In many cases a general-purpose arrangement is used, such as a bit with cylindrical shaft and shank in a three-jaw chuck which grips a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shank</b> tightly. Different shank and chuck combination can deliver improved performance, such as allowing higher torque, greater centering accuracy, or moving the bit, but not the chuck, with a hammer action.|$|E
50|$|The lug's taper is {{normally}} 60 degrees (although 45 {{is common for}} wheels designed for racing applications), and is designed to center the wheel accurately on the axle, and to reduce the tendency for the nut to loosen, due to fretting induced precession, as the car is driven. Honda uses a spherical rather than a tapered seat, but the nut performs the same function. Older style (non-ferrous) alloy wheels have a 1/2 to 1 inch <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shank</b> slipping into the wheel to center it and a washer that applies pressure to clamp the wheel to the axle.|$|E

Specifically, micro-end mills are made by Ga ion beam sputtering of a <b>cylindrical</b> tool <b>shank.</b> Using an ion energy of 20 keV, the focused beam defines the tool cutting edges that have submicrometer radii of curvature. We demonstrate 25 {micro}m diameter micromilling tools having 2, 4 and 5 cutting edges. These tools fabricate fine channels, 26 - 28 microns wide, in 6061 aluminum, brass, and polymethyl methacrylate. Micro-tools are structurally robust and operate for more than 5 hours without fracture...|$|R
50|$|Many chucks have jaws, (sometimes called dogs) {{that are}} {{arranged}} in a radially symmetrical pattern like the points of a star. The jaws are tightened up to hold the tool or workpiece. Often the jaws will be tightened or loosened {{with the help of}} a chuck key, which is a wrench-like tool made for the purpose. Many jawed chucks, however, are of the keyless variety, and their tightening and loosening is by hand force alone. Keyless designs offer the convenience of quicker and easier chucking and unchucking, but have lower gripping force to hold the tool or workpiece, which is potentially more of a problem with <b>cylindrical</b> than hexagonal <b>shanks.</b> Some lathe chucks have independently moving jaws which can also hold irregularly shaped objects (ones that lack radial symmetry). Collet chucks, rather than having jaws, have collets, which are flexible collars or sleeves that fit closely around the tool or workpiece and grip it when squeezed. A few chuck designs are more complex yet, and they involve specially shaped jaws, higher numbers of jaws, quick-release mechanisms, or other special features.|$|R

5000|$|Developed by Bosch in 1975 for hammer drills, the SDS System uses an SDS Shank {{which is}} a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shank</b> with {{indentations}} to be held by the chuck. [...] A tool is inserted into the chuck by pressing in, and is locked in place until a separate lock release is used. The rotary force is supplied through wedges that fit into two or three open grooves. The hammer action actually moves the bit up and down within the chuck since the bit is free to move a short distance. Two sprung balls fit into closed grooves, allowing movement whilst retaining the bit. SDS relies on a tool having the same shank diameter as the chuck; there are three standard sizes: ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a systematic modelling procedure {{for assessing the}} pro®le quality of concave-arc ball-end (CABE) milling cutters with a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shank.</b> CABE milling cutters are widely used in three-axis numerical control (NC) machines for producing dies and moulds of complicated surface features. Evaluation of the contour quality of the CABE milling cutter is crucial in enhancing machining accuracy and eciency. In order adequately to describe {{the shape of the}} clamped cutter, the centre-line axis of the minimum circumscribed cylinder of the cylinder shank is taken as the referenced datum axis. The minimum circumscribed concave-arc revolving surface and the minimum circumscribed spherical surface are carefully derived in sequence. The pro®le errors and tolerances are estimated. The quality of the CABE milling cutter is assured by using the proposed modelling procedure, and several numerical examples are presented to illustrate its eVectiveness. The results indicate that the present method is feasible and can be extended to enhance the quality of various revolving cutters...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} precise {{approach}} to the generation of optimized collision-free and gouging-free tool paths for 5 -axis CNC machining of freeform NURBS surfaces using flat-end and rounded-end (bull nose) tools having <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shank.</b> To achieve high approximation quality, we employ analysis of hyper-osculating circles (HOCs) (Wang et al., 1993 a,b), that have third order contact with the target surface, and lead to a locally collision-free configuration between the tool and the target surface. At locations where an HOC is not possible, we aim at a double tangential contact among the tool and the target surface, {{and use it as}} a bridge between the feasible HOC tool paths. We formulate all such possible two-contact configurations as systems of algebraic constraints and solve them. For all feasible HOCs and two-contact configurations, we perform a global optimization to find the tool path that maximizes the approximation quality of the machining, while being gouge-free and possibly satisfying constraints on the tool tilt and the tool acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via several experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Tests of two 10 -foot-diameter two-blade {{propellers}} which differed only in shank design {{have been}} made in the Langley 16 -foot high-speed tunnel. The propellers are designated by their blade design numbers, NACA 10 -(5) (08) - 03, which had aerodynamically efficient airfoil shank sections, and NACA l 0 -(5) (08) - 03 R which had thick <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shank</b> sections typical of conventiona 1 blades, The propellers mere tested on a 2000 -horsepower dynamometer through a range of blade-angles from 20 deg to 55 deg at various rotational speeds and at airspeeds up to 496 miles per hour. The resultant tip speeds obtained simulate actual flight conditions, and the variation of air-stream Mach number with advance ratio is within the range of full-scale constant-speed propeller operation. Both propellers were very efficient, the maximum envelope efficiency being approximately 0, 95 for the NACA 10 -(5) (08) - 03 propeller and about 5 percent less for the NACA 10 -(5) (08) - 03 R propeller. Based on constant power and rotational speed, the efficiency of the NACA 10 -(05) (08) - 03 propeller was from 2. 8 to 12 percent higher than that of the NACA 10 -(5) (08) - 03 R propeller over a range of airspeeds from 225 to 450 miles per hour. The loss in maximum efficiency at the design blade angle for the NACA 10 -(5) (08) - 03 and 10 -(5) (08) - 03 R propellers vas about 22 and 25 percent, respectively, for an increase in helical tip Mach number from 0. 70 to 1. 14...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Currently, {{straight}} cutting-edge carpenter shapers {{are widely}} used in the production process. The manner of contact between this traditional type of shaper and the workpiece is a piecewise continuous curve. One drawback of shapers of this type is that the noise generated during the cutting process tends to be very loud. In order to overcome this problem, the current paper takes {{the thickness of the}} cutter into account and employs the concept of equidistant lines and surfaces to develop a new carpenter shaper that comprises a helical cutting edge on a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shank</b> surface. The geometric shape of the blade surface that is mounted in the groove of the cutter shank is ®rst derived. The contact curve of the proposed carpenter shaper with the workpiece is shown to be continuous. In order to establish a geometric model that facilitates the simple production of a carpenter helical shaping cutter, this paper presents a new design approach, which constructs an equidistant and equivalent involute helical surface model and a corresponding planar unwinding torus model. The carpenter shaper thus obtained is proven to be successful in reducing the noise levels of the cutting process. The contact style of the shaper also oVers the additional advantages of higher cutting e¤ciency, lower energy consumption and longer tool-life. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the eVectiveness of the proposed modelling approach. The results indicate that the proposed carpenter helical shaping (CHS) cutter model is accurate, e¤cient and comprehensive. The model is su¤ciently accurate that it {{can be used as a}} guideline for the design, manufacture and assembly of robust, reliable and silent wooden shapers...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} the applications of plastic limit analysis to offshore foundations and anchors, including the drag embedment anchors (DEAs) for mobile offshore drilling units (MODU?s) and spudcan foundations for jack-up platforms. In deep waters, drag embedment anchors are an attractive option for mooring of semisubmersible platforms due to low installation cost and high holding capacity; {{on the other}} hand, jack-up platforms are more stable than semisubmersible platforms but only can be placed in shallow waters. The analyses of anchor capacities are developed for an idealized anchor comprising a rectangular fluke, a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>shank,</b> and a metal chain connected to the shank at the padeye. The anchor trajectory prediction during drag embedment is also developed by considering anchor behavior {{in conjunction with the}} mechanics of the anchor line. The results of simulations show that anchors approach at equilibrium condition rapidly during the embedment and both the normalized holding capacity and the anchor line uplift angle remain constants in this stage. Besides the geometry of the fluke, the properties of the shank and soil are also crucial factors in the anchor-soil interaction behavior. Partial failure of mooring systems for floating structures will subject drag anchors to loads having an appreciable component outside of the intended plane of loading. Partial failure of mooring systems during hurricanes in recent years have generated an interest in understanding drag anchor performance under these conditions. The analysis {{presents the}} simulations of three dimensional trajectories of an anchor system subjected to an out-of-plane load component. For the conditions simulated in the example analyses, the anchor experienced a modest amount of continued embedment following partial failure of the mooring system; however, the ultimate embedment and capacity of the anchor is much less than what would have developed if the anchor had continued in its original trajectory within the plane of intended loading. The analyses of the spudcan foundation of jack-up units include preloading, bearing capacity, and the displacement assessment. When the contribution of the soil moment resistance is considered, a three-stage assessment procedure is recommended: superposing environmental forces on the plot of yield surface, determining the value of yield function corresponding to the external forces, and computing the factor of safety of the spudcan. The results of the assessment may be ambiguous while the different yield functions are employed to analyze the spudcan in soft clay...|$|E
