40|$|The {{epidemiological}} {{burden of}} <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> is increasing worldwide {{and there is}} very little empirical evidence regarding the economic impact of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> on individuals and households. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the evidence on how <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> affect household healthcare expenditure, non-health consumption, labour (earned) income, and to demonstrate how transfers may provide some insurance against shocks from <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases.</b> We have explicated a two-part Heckit model on household level data obtained from the Living Standard Measurement Surveys (LSMS) from Russia to control for nontrivial proportion of zeros in the dependent variables, skewed distribution of expenditure data and endogeneity. The results indicate that <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> are significantly associated with higher levels of household healthcare expenditure in Russia and productivity losses reflected by reduced labour supply and reduced household labour income. Non-healthcare expenditure also increased. Results suggest that households are able to insure non-health consumption against <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases,</b> possibly from transfers, which also increased. In addition, socioeconomic status indicators significantly explained the impact of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> on households. Insurance and higher average education in households were associated with higher healthcare expenditure. Household transfers were significant in Russia despite an appreciable level of insurance cover. We conclude that households depend on informal coping mechanisms in the face of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases,</b> irrespective of insurance cover. These results have implications for policies regarding the financing of treatment and control of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in the country studied.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Adolescents with {{intellectual}} disability (ID) (ID-adolescents) and adolescents with <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> are both {{more likely to}} have emotional and behavioural problems. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the association between <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents and emotional and behavioural problems in a large school-based sample. METHODS: We obtained data on 1044 ID-adolescents, aged 12 - 18 years, attending secondary schools in the Netherlands. Parents of the adolescents completed the Dutch version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and questions about <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in their child and about the background of the child. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of emotional and behavioural problems were generally high in ID-adolescents with <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> (45 %), compared with ID-adolescents without <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> (17 %). The likelihood of emotional and behavioural problems was high in ID-adolescents with two [odds ratios (OR) 4. 47; 95 % CI: 2. 97 - 6. 74] or more than two <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> (OR 8. 01; 95 % CI: 5. 18 - 12. 39) and for ID-adolescents with mental <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> (OR 4. 56; 95 % CI: 3. 21 - 6. 47). Also ID-adolescents with somatic <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> had a high likelihood of emotional and behavioural problems (OR 1. 99; 95 % CI: 1. 33 - 2. 99), in particular in the combination of somatic and mental <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> (OR 5. 16; 95 % CI: 3. 46 - 7. 71).

Therefore, this study examined the association between the number of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> and PA in a Dutch working population. MethodsData of 131, 032 workers from the Dutch Public Health Monitor 2012 were used in this cross-sectional study conducted in 2015 in the Netherlands. PA was operationalized as adherence (yes/no) to three PA guidelines. One of these was the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guideline (≥ 3 days/week, ≥ 20 min/day of vigorous-intensity activities). Also, the amount of moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA in min/week for those who were physically active for > 0 min/week was calculated. Associations between <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> (0, 1, ≥ 2 <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases)</b> and PA were examined using logistic regression and Generalized Estimating Equations stratified for age (19 – 54 years/ 55 – 64 years). ResultsWorkers aged 19 – 54 years with one (OR= 0. 90 (99 % CI= 0. 84 – 0. 95)) and multiple <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> (OR= 0. 76 (99 % CI= 0. 69 – 0. 83)) had lower odds of adhering to the ACSM-guideline than workers without <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Similar patterns were found for older workers.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between multiple <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> and depressive symptoms in middle-aged and elderly populations. Methods This study was performed using the 2009 Korean Community Health Survey, which targeted adults over the age of 40 (N =  156, 747 participants, 88, 749 aged 40 – 59  years and 67, 998 aged ≥ 60  years). The Korean version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-K) was used as the measurement tool for depressive symptoms (CES-D-K score over 16). Multiple <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> were defined as the concurrent presence of two or more <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Results The prevalence and risk ratios (RRs) of experiencing depressive symptoms increased in the presence of multiple <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> and with the number of comorbidities. The RRs of experiencing depressive symptoms according to the presence of multiple <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> were higher in the middle-aged population (adjusted RR, 1. 939, 95 % confidence limits (CL), 1. 82 - 2. 06) than in the elderly population (adjusted RR, 1. 620, 95 % CL, 1. 55 - 1. 69). In particular, middle-aged women who suffer from 4 or more <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> have the highest RR (adjusted RR, 4. 985, 95 % CL, 4. 13 - 6. 03) for depressive symptoms. Conclusions Multiple <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> are closely associated with depressive symptoms in middle-aged and elderly populations. Given the mutual relationship between multiple <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> and depressive symptoms, attention to and the assessment of depressive symptoms are needed in people with multiple <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> has risen along with increased longevity. Co-occurrence {{of two or}} more <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in an individual (multimorbidity) is prevalent and poses a huge burden to individuals and the society. However, determinants of multimorbidity are largely unknown. Handgrip strength is a general indicator of muscle strength and linked with premature mortality. However, its role in multimorbidity has never been evaluated. To investigate the relationships between handgrip strength and multiple <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> and multimorbidity, and to assess the usefulness of age and handgrip as a marker of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> and multimorbidity in a community dwelling sample of men and women, we analyzed a cross-sectional cohort with 1, 145 subjects (748 men and 397 women) aged 50  years and older living in Hong Kong. Low handgrip strength was significantly associated with increased odds of having five and three <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in men and women, respectively, after controlling for age, body mass index, history of smoking, educational level, marital level and comorbidity. Multivariable-adjusted handgrip strength was significantly decreased with the number of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in men (trend, P = 0. 001), but the trend in women was marginal (trend, P = 0. 06). Conversely, multivariable-adjusted age was significantly increased with the number of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in women (trend, P = 0. 033), but not in men (trend, P = 0. 118). In conclusion, handgrip strength is associated with multiple <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> and multimorbidity in men and women after adjustment of confounding factors. It shows a linear trend of association with the number of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in men, but not in women. Since handgrip strength is a biomarker of multiple physiological systems, its augmentation may be a feasible strategy to improve general health and decrease likelihood of having multiple <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> and hence, premature mortality. © 2012 The Author(s). published_or_final_versionSpringer Open Choice, 25 May 201...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{background}} information about <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in the Aboriginal population in the NT and to stimulate input and comment to assist in the revision of the Preventable <b>Chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> Strategy (PCDS) and implementation plan.   This paper outlines some of the issues in relation to <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in Aboriginal populations in the NT. It follows on from the previous background paper that compares <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> frameworks and models of care and provides an opportunity to examine specific issues for <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in Aboriginal populations. It is structured around the three key components of the current NT PCDS of prevention, early detection and management of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases.</b> The underlying factors impacting on <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> - Aboriginal community control, the social determinants of health and access to primary health care are included so as to highlight the comprehensive approach required to improve health outcomes. The gap of 17 years between the life expectancy of Aboriginal people and all other Australians is well known. The gap for women is narrowing, albeit much too slowly, however the gap for men is not decreasing. There have been significant reductions in deaths from infectious diseases, maternal, peri natal and nutritional conditions and injuries. In contrast, deaths from <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> increased although the rate of increase slowed. Aboriginal people have much higher rates of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> than other Australians. For Aboriginal people in the NT the most common illnesses are Type 2 diabetes, anxiety and depression, ischaemic heart disease, kidney disease and airways disease. While the social determinants of health have a significant impact on health the evidence shows that much of the burden of <b>disease</b> caused by <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> can be prevented by focusing on the modifiable risk factors – smoking, poor nutrition, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity.  ...|$|R
40|$|Chapter 1 {{introduces}} the key concepts {{and the broader}} context of this thesis and presents its aims, research questions and the methodology of the studies. The studies originate from the need of schools for practical training and schools for special secondary education {{to know more about}} the <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> of their pupils with ID and about the impact of these diseases on their emotional and behavioural functioning. Schools for practical training and schools for special secondary education prepare pupils for entering the labour market and for participation in society. They need information on whether and to what degree ID-adolescents have additional <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> because both ID and <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> can lead to limitations in adolescents’ capacities. Capacities seem to be particularly limited in case of emotional and behavioural problems. In addition, limited capacities can have a profound effect on participation of ID-adolescents in educational programs, occupational opportunities and societal participation. However, evidence on the prevalence rates of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents and the impact on their emotional and behavioural functioning was limited. The aims of this thesis were: (1) to explore the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents and the impact on their behaviour; and (2) to assess the knowledge about <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents among teachers working in schools for practical training and special secondary schools. These goals were translated in the following five research questions: 1. What is known in the literature on the prevalence rates of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in populations of children with ID? 2. What is the prevalence of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents aged 12 – 18 years in two provinces in the north of the Netherlands, Groningen and Drenthe (total population of about 1. 1 million people) ? 3. What is the concordance between the knowledge teachers have on the presence of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents and the knowledge of parents and healthcare professionals? 4. What is the association between <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents and their emotional and behavioural functioning? 5. What is the association between <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents and the full range of pervasive developmental disorder behaviour?...|$|R
40|$|Evidence on teachers' {{knowledge}} about somatic and mental <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> among ID-adolescent {{compared to the}} knowledge parents and healthcare professionals have, is limited. The {{aim of this study}} is: (1) to assess the knowledge of teachers on the presence of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents; (2) to compare teachers with parents and healthcare professionals and parents with healthcare professionals regarding the knowledge on the presence of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents. We obtained data on 1044 ID-adolescents attending secondary schools, fully covering one region of the Netherlands. Teachers, parents and general practitioners (GPs) of the adolescents completed a questionnaire about the occurrence of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in their child during the previous 12 months. The questionnaire was derived from the Dutch National Permanent Survey on Living Conditions questionnaire periodically administered in a representative population sample (n approximate to 10, 000). Concordance between teachers, parents and healthcare professionals on the presence of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents was relatively low. In about half of all 66 dyads the concordance was for the most part fair and just in 10 dyads good to very good; nine of these latter cases concerned somatic <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases.</b> In addition, teachers reported mostly lower prevalence rates of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents compared to the parents, in particular on mental <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Although prevalence rates of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> among ID-adolescents are very high, knowledge on this among teachers is limited. While information on <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents is available among different informants, the disagreement between them reflects different points of view between the informants and probably indicates a lack of communication. The communication among teachers, parents and GPs should be improved to combine the knowledge and information on the presence of <b>chronic</b> <b>diseases</b> in ID-adolescents. This may provide opportunities to improve the support of these adolescents in their school career and in their transition from school to work. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
