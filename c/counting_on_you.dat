500|$|Less than an {{hour before}} the {{independence}} ceremony a Belgian officer arrived to request that Lumumba depart for parliament. Kasongo was disturbed by what Lumumba planned to say and told Kanza as he left, [...] "I'm <b>counting</b> <b>on</b> <b>you</b> to do your best to tone down that speech." [...] As Lumumba dressed, Kanza and one of the secretaries, André Mandi, read through as much of the speech as they could, replacing some individual words with less inflammatory language and crossing out several full paragraphs deemed too difficult to temper. Lumumba then left in a motorcade for his official residence to rendezvous {{with the rest of his}} government. Kanza and Mandi followed in the second car, making additional revisions to the speech. These were so extensive that both feared Lumumba would be unable to clearly read his remarks. Upon their arrival at the residence, Kanza and Mandi briefly explained their alterations to Lumumba. Greatly pleased with the result, Lumumba stated that he would read some parts of the speech verbatim, then improvise to respond to the atmosphere in the room as he saw fit. He made his own alterations to the script during the speeches given by Baudouin and Kasa-Vubu.|$|E
2500|$|Abbott {{formally}} {{announced his}} re-election campaign on July 14, 2017. He chose the Amtrak depot at historic Sunset Station in San Antonio for his formal announcement of candidacy: [...] "I've proven that I'm {{willing to take}} on the liberals, I'm {{willing to take on}} Washington, D.C., and I'm <b>counting</b> <b>on</b> <b>you</b> to have my back." [...] Several protesters were led out of the hall before Abbott began speaking. The formal announcement came four days before the beginning of a special legislative session that could split the Republican Party into factions favoring Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Patrick, on one hand, and House Speaker [...] Joe Straus, a Moderate Republican who opposes much of the Abbott-Patrick conservative agenda.|$|E

2500|$|Pope Benedict XVI created Rosales Cardinal-Priest of Santissimo Nome di Maria in Via Latina in the consistory of March 24, 2006. [...] Rosales joined 14 others, {{two of them}} Asians, as {{the newest}} members of the College of Cardinals. Pope Benedict told the new cardinals: “I want to sum up {{the meaning of this}} new call that you have {{received}} in the word which I placed at the heart of my first Encyclical: caritas. This matches well the color of your cardinal's robes. May the scarlet that you now wear always express the caritas Christi, inspiring you to a passionate love for Christ, for his Church and for all humanity.” A little later, he added: “I am <b>counting</b> <b>on</b> <b>you,</b> dear Brother Cardinals, to ensure that the principle of love will spread far and wide, and will give new life to the Church at every level of her hierarchy, in every group of the faithful, in every religious institute, in every spiritual, apostolic or humanitarian initiative.” ...|$|E

More than half the assets are unmarketable stock and ventures no man could value, while whether they will ever realize anything goodness only knows.
