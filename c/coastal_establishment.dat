5000|$|Prince Rupert School (PRS) {{takes its}} name from the former <b>coastal</b> <b>establishment</b> HMS Royal Rupert, which had {{previously}} been a Kriegsmarine stronghold during Nazi rule, located at the scenic port city of Wilhelmshaven on the North Sea coast. The school has its beginnings from [...] "Operation Union", which allowed Army and RAF personnel based in Allied-occupied West Germany to bring their families over. PRS {{is believed to be the}} first comprehensive, co-educational, boarding school under the terms of the Education Act 1944 and was one of the first schools established in Germany to exclusively educate children of British military personnel. Housed in a block of buildings along the port, it was formally handed over on 1 July 1947, by the lowering of the Royal Navy's white ensign and the raising of the Union flag. Present at this ceremony were many of the first 70 pupils who were attending school for a one-month trial period, prior to the full complement reporting to the school on 7 September 1947. Some pupils missed the ceremony as their truck became lost on its way to Wilhelmshaven. Smitherman, the first headmaster, chose that name in recognition of the kindness and help he had received from the Royal Navy personnel of HMS Royal Rupert. [...] The official opening ceremony of the school by George Tomlinson MP, Minister of Education, took place on 11 May 1948.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese soon {{realized}} that control of Sri Lanka was necessary for protection of their <b>coastal</b> <b>establishments</b> in India {{and they began to}} manipulate the rulers of the Kotte kingdom to gain control of the area. After skilfully exploiting rivalries within the royal family, they took control of a large area of the kingdom and the Sinhalese King Mayadunne established a new kingdom at Sitawaka, a domain in the Kotte kingdom. Before long he annexed much of the Kotte kingdom and forced the Portuguese to retreat to Colombo, which was repeatedly besieged by Mayadunne and the later kings of Sitawaka, forcing them to seek reinforcement from their major base in Goa, India. Following the fall of the kingdom in 1593, the Portuguese were able to establish complete control over the coastal area, with Colombo as their capital.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Purpose: This chapter {{examines}} Sarawak {{economy as}} {{the one of the}} fastest growing states in Malaysia. Far from being content with the current status quo, Sarawak is taking all feasible steps to remain the most competitive state in the country for industrialisation and modernisation. This means there is an urgent need for economic planners to accelerate the state’s growth and development to enable it to attain its goal of becoming an industrialised and financial hub by the turn of the century. Ambitious it may sound, but it is not an impossible task given the state’s inherent advantages from nature’s treasure to its human resources, which are working hand in hand towards making the goal a reality. Method: The official micro and macro economic data were used to examine current economic trends and forecast for the year 2000 and beyond. The overall analysis incorporated surveys from various consultancy firms in the state. Result: Sarawak’s robust economic growth over the last thirty-four years can be attributed to three crucial factors. Firstly, the role of the state in preparing the ground for sound economic growth through transparent government, prudent policies, pragmatic programmes and strategically planned projects. Secondly, the key role of the vibrant private sector as major partners in projects and the overall public-private partnership of the state. Finally, the strong leadership of the Chief Minister has been invaluable in redefining and redesigning the concept of the urban and rural approach resulting in dynamic changes in rural development and <b>coastal</b> network <b>establishments.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|At the Yavne-Yam site in Israel, a Bronze Age <b>coastal</b> {{industrial}} <b>establishment,</b> {{a variety}} of lead objects were found which appear to have some connection with fishing and maritime activities, including bells, weights, and rings of various sizes. At numerous other ancient coastal sites throughout the Mediterranean, similar objects have been documented but no systematic or typological study yet {{has been made of}} them. This study focuses primarily on the archaeological context and potential uses of the lead rings that have been found in maritime contexts, which range in size from small grommets to large, saucer-sized circlet. The potential uses for such lead rings include net and anchor weights, devices for detangling caught fishing line, and securing brail lines. The context, size, and typology of the rings could be indicative of their functions as well as the size of the assemblages and their date. Additionally, ancient texts can provide some insight on ancient sailing and fishing practices, in particular the work of Strabo and Oppian. Some preliminary results and conclusions based on these investigations are presented here. In addition to {{a variety of}} rings, a lead “bell” with a ball in the middle and several similar objects were also found at the Yavne-Yam site. In context, these discoveries suggest that bells were used in certain types of fishing at Yavne-Yam in antiquity, perhaps as described in Oppian. Conversely, they could also have been used as sounding weights to find the depth of the water and what the seabed was made of. Since the “bells” come in different shapes and sizes, they could have served multiple different purposes. This study helps us understand the range of possible identifications and functions when considering the correct labeling of Yavne-Yam’s lead objects. Most importantly, connecting these uses to their societies and creating a more accurate historic profile provides a way for Mediterranean archaeologists to help identify the objects and understand their role on a bigger stage...|$|R
40|$|The southeastern United States harbors {{an unusually}} large number of endemic plant taxa, which may reflect the refugial nature of the region during Pleistocene glacial maxima. Understanding the genetic {{diversity}} and structure of extant plant taxa can provide insights into the biogeographical processes that shaped them genetically. Here, we investigate the levels and partitioning of allozyme diversity in the southeastern North American endemic, Ceratiola ericoides, which displayed greater genetic variation and structure than other endemics. Central Florida populations represent a center of genetic diversity, whereas South Carolina and Georgia Fall Line sandhill populations have {{a subset of the}} Central Florida genetic diversity and may be relicts of a once continuous distribution. This much broader, continuous distribution throughout the southeastern United States occurred during glacial maxima when the scrub habitat, dominated by C. ericoides, expanded considerably owing to drier climatic conditions. Georgia Coastal Plain populations appear to have been independently founded more recently by propagules from Central Florida and the Fall Line sandhills because they have an even more limited subset of genetic diversity and greater genetic heterogeneity among populations. Since their <b>establishment,</b> <b>coastal</b> plain populations appear to have had little, if any, gene exchange among each other or with the relatively proximate Fall Line sandhill populations. These data underscore the importance of understanding the genetic composition and historical biogeograph...|$|R
40|$|Extreme {{events such}} as storm surges and tsunamis in {{combination}} with subsidence of densely populated coastal areas pose an increasing threat {{to millions of people}} in the tropics. Intertidal mangrove forests may form a natural protection against some extreme events, but have also widely been destroyed by <b>coastal</b> development. The <b>establishment</b> of mangroves and the maintenance of their stability over the short- to long-term requires an understanding of sedimentary processes and landforms in the coastal zone, making geomorphology a crucial, but sometimes neglected discipline when attempting restoration for disaster risk reduction. Mangrove geomorphic setting varies markedly across the tropics, depending on abiotic parameters such as suspended sediment supply and tidal range, with different restoration strategies suitable for each. In this study we provide a global categorization of mangrove geomorphic settings, based on the literature and global remote sensing data. The world's mangroves can be broadly defined as: (1) minerogenic and high tidal range; (2) minerogenic and low tidal range; and (3) organogenic and low tidal range. We further discuss restoration and management approaches most suitable for each geomorphic setting. Overall, this study can be used to inform managers about the relevance of geomorphic knowledge for successful mangrove restoration, how an understanding of geomorphology can influence site selection and restoration success, and how to match specific restoration methods to the prevailing geomorphic context. The stronger incorporation of geomorphic knowledge into site planning and design will improve the success rates of restoration for this important and globally threatened ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|Population {{biology and}} socio-ecology of Indo-Pacific {{humpback}} dolphins Sousa chinensis were investigated during a 3 -year study {{period in the}} Algoa Bay region, South Africa. The dolphins inhabit a narrow strip of coastal waters, mostly less than 15 m deep. Groups are small (mean = 7 animals) and their daily activities concentrate around shallow rocky reefs-the primary feeding grounds. Dependence on these restricted, shallow-water habitats is evident throughout the year. Site fidelity is generally weak and is subject to seasonal migration, although female site fidelity seems {{to be related to}} reproductive stage. Births occur predominantly in summer. The social system is highly fluid, structured to some degree by sex and age, 'matesearching' behavior being the most likely male reproductive strategy. The dolphins inhabiting Algoa Bay are part of a substantially larger population that uses a considerable length of the coastal zone. Estimated population parameters are generally low, as are modelled population growth rates, and an increase in the population size seems unlikely. Humpback dolphins appear to be vulnerable to negative environmental pressure and the alteration/destruction of inshore habitats is probably among the greatest threats to them. Conservation of this species should be given high priority and be seen as an important part of integrated <b>coastal</b> zone management. <b>Establishment</b> of multiple-use management areas with controlled ecotourism and several priority sites declared as strict reserves seems to be the most effective conservation approach. In order to be successful, conservation and management policies need to recognize the needs and lifestyles of the local inhabitants. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the performance of}} the intelligence collection organisations of the armed services of New Zealand during the Second World War. It considers the intelligence bodies of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force and looks at their growth, development and demise, and assesses their effectiveness as intelligence organisations. The question of how much New Zealand could be expected to achieve in the field of intelligence arises, not least because New Zealand was demographically small, had a long coastline and was geographically relatively remote. How much could New Zealand contribute to the Allied cause in intelligence terms is another issue, and what forms did any participation take? Were there lessons to be learned from the wartime experience (there were, but they went for the most part largely unheeded) ? New Zealand, like other countries, had a fragmented approach to intelligence collection, making for a degree of complexity over a range of activity, despite the intelligence organisations being of modest size. The examination of the organisations in this thesis includes multi-service and multi-departmental dimensions along with the production of useful intelligence. Whether good use was made of intelligence collected is another matter. There was a substantial amount of liaison, contact and practice between departments of state as to various aspects of intelligence, the Organization for National Security and coastwatching being two notable areas. The overarching role and limitations of the Organization for National Security with regard to intelligence is explored, {{and the development of a}} combined intelligence centre examined. The participation of New Zealand signals intelligence organisations in the great Allied interception offensive is detailed, along with the mundane but fundamental task of <b>coastal</b> surveillance. The <b>establishment</b> and spectacular decline of the first local independent security service is traced. Both the intelligence and security aspects of the Army's operationally deployed units are covered, along with the growth of RNZAF air intelligence. The effectiveness of all of these organisations could hardly be expected to be uniform, and indeed it was not. Some bodies succeeded in their collection roles beyond expectations, others were reasonably effective, and two organisations failed dismally in different ways, for a number of reasons. If a pattern emerges at all, it is that small single service component-type intelligence sections collecting operational intelligence were the most effective New Zealand intelligence organisations. Operational focus and. operational requirements underlay the drive for successful collection. Most significant within the Allied context were the signals intelligence bodies. At the other end of the scale, larger co-operative interdepartmental New Zealand intelligence ventures failed to deliver projected results. New Zealand's armed forces had an interesting variety of intelligence contributions during the Second World War. Of these, the most effective organisations collected intelligence to meet directed operational requirements...|$|R
