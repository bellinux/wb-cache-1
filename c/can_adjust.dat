In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the facial nerve, which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Steam {{introduced}} {{the ability to}} share most games with family members and close friends by authorizing machines to access one's library. Authorized players can install the game locally and play it separately from the owning account. Users can access their saved games and achievements providing the main owner is not playing. When the main player initiates a game while a shared account is using it, the shared account user is allowed {{a few minutes to}} either save their progress and close the game or purchase the game for his or her own account. Within Family View, introduced in January 2014, parents <b>can</b> <b>adjust</b> settings for their children's tied accounts, limiting the functionality and accessibility to the Steam client and purchased titles.|$|E

By finding secrets and activating lights throughout the level, the player raises their score and final medal ranking. There are also secret levels hidden throughout the game, where the player completes objectives against the clock. The player can compete against a ghost copy of their previous path through a level.

50|$|A {{second type}} of {{equalizer}} used in monitor systems are parametric equalizers. A parametric equalizer does not use fixed frequency bands. Instead each frequency band <b>can</b> be <b>adjusted.</b> The center frequency <b>can</b> be <b>adjusted</b> over a several-octave range. The bandwidth of each band <b>can</b> be <b>adjusted</b> from a wide Q affecting several octaves to a narrow Q affecting 1/3rd, 1/6th, or less of an octave, {{and the level of}} the band <b>can</b> be <b>adjusted.</b> Each band may have a different frequency sweep range, with the left or lower bands sweeping the lower octaves, the middle bands sweeping the middle octaves, and the right or higher bands sweeping the higher octaves. There is normally a lot of overlap between bands. Parametric equalizers typically have 3 to 5 filtering bands per channel. Examples of parametric equalizers are Rane PE 55 and Klark Teknik DN410.|$|R

25|$|Most insects {{have a high}} {{reproductive}} rate.

Although there are many forms of reproductive organs in insects, there remains a basic design and function for each reproductive part. These individual parts may vary in shape (gonads), position (accessory gland attachment), and number (testicular and ovarian glands), with different insect groups.|$|E
25|$|There {{are strong}} network {{effects in the}} initial choice of rail gauge, and in gauge {{conversion}} decisions. Even when placing isolated rails not connected to any other lines, track layers usually choose a standard rail gauge so they can use off-the-shelf rolling stock.
