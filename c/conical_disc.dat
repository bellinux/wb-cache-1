40|$|Canter {{chippers}} {{are used}} in sawmills to reduce the circular cross section of logs to a rectangular shape before sawing. The canter chipper is a <b>conical</b> <b>disc</b> equipped with knives on its periphery. When rotated at high velocity it transforms the outer parts of a log into sawdust and chips. It {{is important to be}} able to predict the energy consumption during canting since it is useful to know whether a particular canting strategy can be employed in situations where there is a limit on the power supply. A theoretical model in which energy consumption can be calculated is necessary for such a prediction. Data concerning the specific cutting energy is needed to develop the model for the canting operation. In this paper the energy consumption during chipping of spruce is determined by using a pilot wood chipper at two different cutting rates and for several cutting angles. The results indicate that the specific energy to cut wood chips increases as the angle between the fibre direction and the cutting plane increases...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally the {{performance}} of centrifugal spreaders is evaluated in spreading halls by measuring fertiliser distribution patterns in standardised tests. Alternative distribution patterns can be measured with compact devices that intercept the particle flow immediately after leaving the spinning disc. An experimental facility was built which allowed the measurement of the tangential, {{as well as the}} cylindrical distribution of the particle flow at the disc edge. A number of experiments were carried out, using one type of centrifugal spreader with a <b>conical</b> <b>disc.</b> The influences of vane length, mass flow rate, particle size and fertiliser type on both the tangential and the cylindrical distribution patterns have been investigated. The results show that flows of particles with a larger mean diameter achieve a higher velocity on the disc, causing the distribution patterns to shift to lower angular positions. Furthermore, it is concluded that a smaller average particle size leads to a higher mass discharge flow rate from the hopper. In addition, a shift of the cylindrical distribution to a lower vertical position is observed when the mass flow rate increases. (C) 2003 Silsoe Research Institute.

40|$|Spinning disc {{centrifugal}} {{fertilizer spreader}} is important since 90 % of the 140 million tons/annum worldwide fertilizer production is spread using this simple and robust tool.

A combination of a recent analytical model for description of motion on a spinning disc and the hodographic ballistics is achieved. The combined model can be considered nearly exact for single particles leaving a <b>conical</b> <b>disc</b> with pitched straight vanes. The ballistic flight is approached with constant drag coefficient that is validated by the hodographic method. ”In-silico ” spreading experiments using experimentally characterized particle clusters are sensitive to spreader and fertilizer properties. Parameters like loading area on the disc and drag coefficient in the air however, may need empirical corrections to reliably simulate transversal spreading patterns {{and the quality of}} spreading as a function of working with. The present software tool may be put to good use in machine construction and teaching. A spreader with two spinning discs is implemented in the calculations.

40|$|In modern sawmills, chipper canters {{are used}} to {{transform}} the approximately circular cross section of logs into a rectangular shape before the log is sawn into planks and boards. The chipper canter is in essence a <b>conical</b> <b>disc</b> equipped with knives on its periphery and a circular saw blade at its base. Thorough {{the action of the}} chipper canter, the outer parts of a log is removed and transformed into sawdust and chips. In some situations it might be important to be able to predict the energy consumption during canting, for example when one wants to know whether a particular canting strategy can be used considering that {{there is a limit to}} the electrical power supply. The aim of this paper was therefore to develop a theoretical model that can perform such a prediction. The canting process can be divided into two parts; the chipping performed by knifes and the sawing performed by the saw blade on the chipper head. The sawing part is performed in order to get a smooth enough surface of the reduced portion of the log. In this paper, emphasis is put on the chipping part of the process and the contribution from sawing is treated only in principal. The results from the theoretical model were compared to results from a field trial and it was concluded that the model gave a fair prediction of the power needed...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical pulps {{are used}} in paper {{products}} such as magazine or news grade printing papers or paperboard. Mechanical pulping gives a high yield; nearly everything in the tree except the bark {{is used in the}} paper. This means that mechanical pulping consumes much less wood than chemical pulping, especially to produce a unit area of printing surface. A drawback of mechanical pulp production is the high amounts of electrical energy needed to separate and refine the fibers to a given fiber quality. Mechanical pulps are often produced from slow growing spruce trees of forests in the northern hemisphere resulting in long, slender fibers that are well suited for mechanical pulp products. These fibers have large varieties in geometry, mainly wall thickness and width, depending on seasonal variations and growth conditions. Earlywood fibers typically have thin walls and latewood fibers thick. The background to this study was that a more detailed fiber characterization involving evaluations of distributions of fiber characteristics, may give improved possibilities to optimize the mechanical pulping process and thereby reduce the total electric energy needed to reach a given quality of the pulp and final product. This would result in improved competitiveness as well as less environmental impact. This study evaluated the relation between fiber characteristics in three types of mechanical pulps made from Norway spruce (Picea abies), thermomechanical pulp(TMP), stone groundwood pulp (SGW) and chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). In addition, the influence of fibers from these pulp types on sheet characteristics, mainly tensile index, was studied. A comparatively rapid method was presented on how to evaluate the propensity of each fiber to form sheets of high tensile index, by the use of raw data from a commercially available fiber analyzer (FiberLabTM). The developed method gives novel opportunities of evaluating the effect on the fibers of each stage in the mechanical pulping process and has a potential to be applied also on‐line to steer the refining and pulping process by the characteristics of the final pulp {{and the quality of the}} final paper. The long fiber fraction is important for the properties of the whole pulp. It was found that fiber wall thickness and external fibrillation were the fibercharacteristics that contributed the most to tensile index of the long fiber fractions in five mechanical pulps (three TMPs, one SGW, one CTMP). The tensile index of handsheets of the long fiber fractions could be predicted by linear regressions using a combination of fiber wall thickness and degree of external fibrillation. The predicted tensile index was denoted BIN, short for Bonding ability INfluence. This resulted in the same linear correlation between BIN and tensile index for 52 samples of the five mechanical pulps studied, each fractionated into five streams(plus feed) in full size hydrocyclones. The Bauer McNett P 16 /R 30 (passed 16 meshwire, retained on a 30 mesh wire) and P 30 /R 50 fractions of each stream were used for the evaluation. The fibers of the SGW had thicker walls and a higher degree of external fibrillation than the TMPs and CTMP, which resulted in a correlation between BIN and tensile index on a different level for the P 30 /R 50 fraction of SGW than the other pulp samples. A BIN model based on averages weighted by each fiber´s wall volume instead of arithmetic averages, took the fiber wall thickness of the SGW into account, and gave one uniform correlation between BIN and tensile index for all pulp samples (12 samples for constructing the model, 46 for validatingit). If the BIN model is used for predicting averages of the tensile index of a sheet, a model based on wall volume weighted data is recommended. To be able to produce BIN distributions where the influence of the length or wall volume of each fiber is taken into account, the BIN model is currently based on arithmetic averages of fiber wall thickness and fibrillation. Fiber width used as a single factor reduced the accuracy of the BIN model. Wall volume weighted averages of fiber width also resulted in a completely changed ranking of the five hydrocyclone streams compared to arithmetic, for two of thefive pulps. This was not seen when fiber width was combined with fiber wallthickness into the factor “collapse resistance index”. In order to avoid too high influence of fiber wall thickness and until the influence of fiber width on BIN and the measurement of fiber width is further evaluated, it is recommended to use length weighted or arithmetic distributions of BIN and other fiber characteristics. A comparably fast method to evaluate the distribution of fiber wall thickness and degree of external fibrillation with high resolution showed that the fiber wallthickness of the latewood fibers was reduced by increasing the refining energy in adouble disc refiner operated at four levels of specific energy input in a commercial TMP production line. This was expected but could not be seen by the use of average values, it was concluded that fiber characteristics in many cases should be evaluated as distributions and not only as averages. BIN distributions of various types of mechanical pulps from Norway spruce showed results that were expected based on knowledge of the particular pulps and processes. Measurements of mixtures of a news‐ and a SC (super calendered) gradeTMP, showed a gradual increase in high‐BIN fibers with higher amounts of SCgrade TMP. The BIN distributions also revealed differences between the pulps that were not seen from average fiber values, for example that the shape of the BINdistributions was similar for two pulps that originated from <b>conical</b> <b>disc</b> refiners, a news grade TMP and the board grade CTMP, although the distributions were on different BIN levels. The SC grade TMP and the SC grade SGW had similar levels of tensile index, but the SGW contained some fibers of very low BIN values which may influence the characteristics of the final paper, for example strength, surface and structure. This shows that the BIN model has the potential of being applied on either the whole or parts of a papermaking process based on mechanical or chemimechanical pulping; the evaluation of distributions of fiber characteristics can contribute to increased knowledge about the process and opportunities to optimize it...|$|E

50|$|The inner peridium, or spore sac, {{is nearly}} spherical, 2.5 - 5 mm thick, pale gray to pale tan in color, and dusted with fine whitish {{particles}} that also cover the inner {{surface of the}} freshly opened rays. The mouth on {{the apex of the}} peridium is very small, minutely fibrous, and surrounded by a <b>conical,</b> white <b>disc</b> which is distinctly outlined and radially fibrous (if not deeply grooved). As the fruit body matures, the fibrous layer of the outer peridium splits, star-like, into three to six rays about halfway down or more. The fungus is fornicate, meaning that the rays curve downward so that the base of the fruit body becomes arched up, which elevates the spore sac. This leaves its delicate fibrous, mycelial layer as a distinct, membranous, white cup on the underside, with its margin also rayed by slits, the rays attached to the rays of the plant above. When freshly opened, the inner surface of the rays is covered with a fleshy, pale buff, layer of tissue. This layer, when dry, forms the thin, tan or light brown, smooth and nearly complete membrane over the fibrous layer. The underside of the rays is white and smooth.
