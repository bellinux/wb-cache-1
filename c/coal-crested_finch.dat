50|$|The <b>coal-crested</b> <b>finch</b> (Charitospiza eucosma) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thraupidae. Though {{previously}} classified in the bunting and American sparrow family Emberizidae, more recent studies suggest it {{is closer to the}} tanagers. Its current family status is incertae sedis. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Charitospiza.|$|E
50|$|Birds include parrots, toucans, emus, buzzards, blue macaws, Merganser, Inhambu-Carap√© and sharp-tailed grass tyrant.The veery (Catharus fuscescens) of North America {{lives in}} the unit in from November to February.Nine endemic species of bird have been found. Large-billed antwren (Herpsilochmus longirostris), helmeted manakin (Antilophia galeata) and white-striped warbler (Myiothlypis leucophrys) {{are found in the}} forest {{formations}} of the unit. The collared crescentchest (Melanopareia torquata), rufous-sided pygmy tyrant (Euscarthmus rufomarginatus), curl-crested jay (Cyanocorax cristatellus), shrike-like tanager (Neothraupis fasciata), white-rumped tanager (Cypsnagra hirundinacea) and <b>coal-crested</b> <b>finch</b> (Charitospiza eucosma) are found in the closed cerrado.|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{in birds}} is often attributed to sexual selection, but another interpretation suggests {{the evolution of}} this phenomenon by natural selection. Predation {{may be an important}} selective pressure, acting mainly on females. In this study, I tested the latter hypothesis on the <b>coal-crested</b> <b>finch</b> (Charitospiza eucosma Oberholser, 1905) in a neotropical savanna of the Central Brazil (Cerrado). I used capture methods for ascertaining the sex ratio in the population, and focal observations to gather behavioral data. My results show that the sex ratio is skewed toward males (1 : 1. 39). Males were more vigilant, vocalized for longer periods of time, and used higher perches than females. Females foraged more, spent more time on parental care and remained on the ground for longer periods than males. These results support the 'foraging effort hypothesis, suggesting that females are more preyed upon because they spend more time foraging. Ultimately, this may reflect the fact that females invest more on parental care than males. The sex-dependent parental investment may favor the evolution of different antipredator strategies in males and females: the camouflage in females as a less efficient strategy than vigilance in males...|$|E
