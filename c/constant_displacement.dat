50|$|The rate is {{reckoned}} {{with respect to}} the change in crack area, so if we use U for strain energy, the strain energy release rate is numerically dU/dA. It may be noted that for a body loaded in <b>constant</b> <b>displacement</b> mode, the displacement is applied and the force level is dictated by stiffness (or compliance) of the body. If the crack grows in size, the stiffness decreases, so the force level will decrease. This decrease in force level under the same displacement (strain) level indicates that the elastic strain energy stored in the body is decreasing—is being released. Hence the term strain energy release rate which is usually denoted with symbol G.|$|E

40|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of accelerations to be encountered on orbiting spacecraft: (1) quasi-steady accelerations, caused by atmospheric drag or by gravity gradients, 10 (exp - 6) to 10 (exp - 7) g sub o; (2) transient accelerations, caused by movements of the astronauts, mass translocations, landing and departure of other spacecraft, etc.; and (3) oscillary accelerations, caused by running machinery (fans, pumps, generators). Steady accelerations cause continuing displacements; transients cause time-limited displacements. The important aspect is the area under the acceleration curve, measured over a certain time interval. Note that this quantity is not equivalent to a velocity because of friction effects. Transient motions are probably less important than steady accelerations because they only produce <b>constant</b> <b>displacements.</b> If the accelerative forces were not equal and opposite, the displacement would increase with time.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the conditions necessary to achieve optimum chest compression (CC) performance during <b>constant</b> peak <b>displacement</b> cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This was accomplished by first performing a sensitivity analysis on a theoretical <b>constant</b> peak <b>displacement</b> CPR CC model to identify the parameters with the highest sensitivity. Next, the most sensitive parameters were then optimized for net sternum-to-spine compression depth, using a two-variable non-linear least squares method. The theoretical CC model was found to be most sensitive to: thoracic stiffness, maximum sternal displacement, CC rate, and back support stiffness. Based on a two-variable, non-linear least squares analysis to optimize the model for the net sternum-to-spine compression depth during <b>constant</b> peak <b>displacement</b> CPR, it was found that the optimum ranges for the CC rate and back support stiffness are between 40 - 120  cpm and 241. 0 - 1198. 5  Ncm- 1, respectively. Clinically, this suggests that current ERC guidelines for the CC rate during peak displacement CPR are appropriate; however, practitioners should be aware that the stiffness of the back support surfaces found in many hospitals may be sub-optimal and should consider using a backboard or a concrete floor to enhance CPR effectiveness. © 2011 International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.

Studies have shown that people afraid of heights or falling have poor postural control, especially in the absence of strong visual cues.

Screrefennae moved a lot and did not bring to the field crops, but made their living by hunting and collecting bird eggs. Suehans was a seminomadic tribe that had good horses like Thüringians and ran fur hunting to sell the skins. It was too far north to grow grain. Prokopios, ca. 550 AD, also describes a primitive hunter people he calls skrithifinoi. These pitiful creatures had neither wine nor corn, for they did not grow any crops.
