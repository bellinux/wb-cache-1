40|$|Polysilsesquioxanes are a {{class of}} {{siloxane}} polymers commonly prepared by the hydrolysis and condensation of trialkoxysilanes or trichlorosilanes. From a trifunctional monomer one would expect the organically-modified polymers to be highly crosslinked and insoluble resins. However, while some silsesquioxane monomers with R = H, CH{sub 3 }, or vinyl do form crosslinked polymers capable of forming gels, the majority react to form soluble oligosilsesquioxanes, including discrete polyhedral oligomers, and polymers. Because of their solubility, ladder structures have been proposed. However, viscosity studies by Frye indicate that the polyphenylsilsesquioxane is more likely best represented by a polymer rich in both cyclic structures and branches, but without any regular stereochemistry. In this study, the authors have examined the hydrolysis and <b>condensation</b> <b>polymerizations</b> of phenyltrialkoxysilane, benzyltrialkoxysilane, and 2 -phenethyltrialkoxysilane monomers under both acidic and basic conditions.

40|$|A {{series of}} copoly(arylene ether sulfone) s having {{precisely}} two, {{three or four}} quaternary ammonium (QA) groups clustered directly on single phenylene rings along the backbone are studied as anion exchange membranes. The copolymers are synthesized via <b>condensation</b> <b>polymerizations</b> involving either di-, tri- or tetramethylhydroquinone, followed by virtually complete benzylic bromination using N-bromosuccinimide and quaternization with trimethylamine. This synthetic strategy allows an excellent control and systematic variation of the local density and distribution of QA groups along the backbone. Small angle X-ray scattering of these copolymers shows extensive ionic clustering, promoted by an increasing density of QA on the single phenylene rings. At an ionexchangecapacity (IEC) of 2. 1 meq. g- 1, the water uptake decrease with an increasing local density of QA groups. Moreover, at moderate IECs at 20 °C the Br- conductivity of the densely functionalized copolymers is higher than a corresponding randomly functionalized polymer, despite the significantly higher water uptake of the latter. Thus, placing multiple cations on single aromatic rings in the polymers facilitates {{the formation of a}} distinct percolating hydrophilic phase domain with high ionic concentration to promote efficient anion transport, despite probable limitations by reduced ion dissociation.

The difference between the sooting tendencies of aliphatics and aromatics is thought to result mainly from the different routes of formation.
