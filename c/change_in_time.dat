5|$|De Broglie's {{prediction}} {{of a wave}} nature for electrons led Erwin Schrödinger to postulate a wave equation for electrons moving {{under the influence of}} the nucleus in the atom. In 1926, this equation, the Schrödinger equation, successfully described how electron waves propagated. Rather than yielding a solution that determined the location of an electron over time, this wave equation also could be used to predict the probability of finding an electron near a position, especially a position near where the electron was bound in space, for which the electron wave equations did not <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> This approach led to a second formulation of quantum mechanics (the first by Heisenberg in 1925), and solutions of Schrödinger's equation, like Heisenberg's, provided derivations of the energy states of an electron in a hydrogen atom that were equivalent to those that had been derived first by Bohr in 1913, and that were known to reproduce the hydrogen spectrum. Once spin and the interaction between multiple electrons were describable, quantum mechanics made it possible to predict the configuration of electrons in atoms with atomic numbers greater than hydrogen.|$|E

25|$|Thermodynamic {{equilibrium}} {{is characterized}} by the free energy for the whole (closed) system being a minimum. For systems at constant volume the Helmholtz free energy is minimum and for systems at constant pressure the Gibbs free energy is minimum.

25|$|The {{transition}} from childhood to adolescence {{can be seen}} in the amount of work children partake in as this changes over time. For example, Yucatec Mayan children's play time decreases from childhood to adolescence and as the child gets older, is replaced for time spent working. In childhood the work is initiated by others whereas in adolescence it is self-initiated. The shift in initiation and the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> spent working versus playing shows the children's motivation to participate in order to learn.|$|E

25|$|If {{the system}} doesn't <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> they {{eliminate}} all {{movement in the}} direction of the constraint, thus constraint forces do not perform work on the system, as the velocity of that object is constrained to be 0 parallel to this force, due to this force. This only applies for a single particle system. For example, in an Atwood machine, the rope does work on each body, but keeping always the net virtual work null. There are, however, cases where this is not true.|$|E
25|$|The Institute also {{attempted}} to reformulate dialectics as a concrete method. The {{use of such}} a dialectical method {{can be traced back}} to the philosophy of Hegel, who conceived dialectic as the tendency of a notion to pass over into its own negation as the result of conflict between its inherent contradictory aspects. In opposition to previous modes of thought, which viewed things in abstraction, each by itself and as though endowed with fixed properties, Hegelian dialectic has the ability to consider ideas according to their movement and <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> as well as according to their interrelations and interactions.|$|E
25|$|Wave {{functions}} {{change as}} time progresses. The Schrödinger equation describes how wave functions <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> {{playing a role}} similar to Newton's second law in classical mechanics. The Schrödinger equation, applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle, predicts that {{the center of a}} wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time. This also has the effect of turning a position eigenstate (which {{can be thought of as}} an infinitely sharp wave packet) into a broadened wave packet that no longer represents a (definite, certain) position eigenstate.|$|E

Even though these <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> allocation do not conform to our prediction for binding minimum age regulation or compulsory schooling separately, the observed <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> allocation may follow from the combination (although the lack of a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> schooling is not consistent with binding compulsory schooling regulation).|$|R

[...] Chaffin (again briefly acting director in von Engelken's absence) declined {{to pay for his}} journey, and MacNeil did not come. [...] According to Burdette, [...] "the action saved the government less than $20 in October, but may have cost many times that amount before the revised quarter design was accepted the following year." [...] Von Engelken viewed sample coins about that time. [...] He objected to two leaves of the olive branch on the obverse that lay within the angle of the [...] "L" [...] in [...] "Liberty" [...] and asked that they be removed; this was done. [...] The Mint Director then met with Secretary McAdoo to view coins struck from the modified dies. [...] McAdoo felt that the figure of Liberty was indistinct, but von Engelken persuaded him that could not be changed without considerable delay. [...] They did decide that the Mint could make the shield clearer, and approved the design with that instruction. [...] Feeling it was impossible to make the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> to strike coins in 1916, von Engelken instructed Joyce that beginning in 1917, the figure of Liberty should be sharpened. [...] By the time dies were finally made, the year 1916 was almost over, and only 52,000 quarters were struck. [...] This was done as proof that the Barber design had been replaced in the 25th year, as Mint officials believed was required.|$|E
