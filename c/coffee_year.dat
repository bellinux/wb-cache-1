A cross-sectional study design was used to describe the current situation and establish any relationships between adoption of coffee certification standards and productivity. Researcher administered questionnaires were used to collect data from 270 coffee farmers. Stratified random sampling was used to sample the farmers in each agroecological zone. Productivity was defined as kilograms cherry produced per coffee tree.

A study was conducted to assess the organic carbon pool under Young and Old tree plantations at Uhonmora, Edo State, Nigeria. The plantation species included Anacadium occidentales, Theobroma cacao and Coffea robusta. Result showed that SOC pool was the maximum in the old cashew plots (45 years) and decreased in the following order SOC in young cocoa (1 <b>year)</b> > young <b>coffee</b> (6 <b>years)</b> > old cocoa (46 years) > young cashew (2 <b>years)</b> > old <b>coffee</b> (20 <b>years).</b> Results also indicated that differences in SOC pool under different plantation were statistically significant (p ≤ 0. 05). The A. Occidentals plot had 6. 36 g/kg soil organic carbon after 45 years in this study and it was found to store more than double SOC pool when compared to other plantations. The soils also vary in the N contents. The young cashew plot was low in N content but adequate for other plots. Using the SOC as indicator, the soil organic matter content needs to be improved upon for sustainable productivity. Soil texture in all the plantations was loamy sand. Soil organic carbon content variation across the plantations with age of establishment will necessitate the need to produce a suitable habitat for microorganisms which are involved in litter degradation process.
