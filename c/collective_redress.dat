40|$|Once a {{preserve}} of the American legal landscape, the class action device today transcends geographic boundaries. In the past decade, efforts have intensified to establish collective litigation instruments in diverse legal terrains outside the United States - including Europe - {{often with the}} common goal of allowing some form of <b>collective</b> legal <b>redress</b> while avoiding perceived disadvantages of class actions in the American experience. Today more than ever, from legislators to litigants to scholars, European reformers face the challenge - and the opportunity - of making fundamental choices about the scope {{and shape of the}} collective legal remedies they wish to make available. Choices about the shape of the class action device reflect foundational judgments about the proper allocation of costs, and there is much from the U. S. experience that can inform Europe's prospective reformers. This article describes the history and current status of class action rules in the U. S., and then compares class actions and another form of extra-compensatory damages - one type of punitive damages â as means of doing the same thing. Although neither punitive damages of this sort nor class actions generally have traditionally existed in civil law systems, they both - and especially this particular form of punitive damages - can, from an economic view, be made to vindicate the same kind of social cost accounting goals. By considering these legal devices together, we hope to shed light on crucial choices facing Europe as it grapples with how best to provide <b>collective</b> legal <b>redress</b> in light of the lessons of the U. S. experience with class actions. Class actions, <b>Collective</b> legal <b>redress,</b> Punitive damages, Extra-compensatory damages, Allocation of costs, Deterrence...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the private enforcement of EU competition law and forum shopping with a particular focus on cross-border <b>collective</b> end-consumer <b>redress.</b> There is no coherent framework across the EU for these types of cases. This lack of uniformity has the potential to create recourse to different national courts. Lawyers may engage in forum shopping when filing lawsuits on behalf of the victims of mass torts. Such practices can provide Member States with incentives to amend their laws to attract collective proceedings and create competition between national judicial systems. However, forum shopping is not the only concern. There appears to be a paucity of cross-border collective claims. This is coupled with an apparent lack of motivation for end-consumers to seek a remedy, particularly if the only choice is to litigate outside their own legal regime. Addressing this situation is vital given that end-consumers regularly suffer harm in the form of higher prices, lower output, reduced quality and limited innovation as a result of antitrust infringements but they are rarely compensated due to legal and practical obstacles. To each end-consumer the harm may indeed be de minimis. However, the aggregate harm can amount to a considerable sum. In the absence of effective redress procedures, infringing undertakings retain the spoils of their unlawful conduct. Against this background, this thesis {{examines the}} extent to which the conflicts-of-laws rules encourage forum shopping and considers the appropriate forum and the appropriate procedural measures that need to be adopted in order to facilitate effective and equal access to justice for end-consumer victims of EU competition law violations...|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} we examine, through ethnographic {{research}} data, whether downshifting behaviour is possible within UK alternative community lifestyles, {{how it is}} manifested, and whether it may be considered a form of resistance to consumer culture in such a context. Contrary to our expectations, and although a few individuals within the examined communities still presented anti-consumer culture discourses, the communal and most individual approaches to discourses and practices encompassing downshifting and ethical consumption were not about resisting, but about living a positive alternative. By conceptually viewing these communities as ‘positive alternatives’, we can understand their production, consumption, consumption avoidance {{as well as their}} disposal practices not as attempts to escape, resist or subvert the market, but as <b>collective</b> efforts to <b>redress</b> what they perceive as the shortcomings of consumer culture, the marketplace and their effects on people’s everyday lives.

40|$|This study {{documents}} and critically evaluates {{the history of}} the alter-globalization movement in Canada. It makes a contribution to existing scholarship by providing the most comprehensive historical account available of the movement's major mobilizations during the past fifteen years. The study also deploys an interdisciplinary theoretical framework to examine the largely overlooked temporal dimensions of contemporary activism in the age of instant communication. While recent years have seen a proliferation of scholarship lauding the advantages of ""new media activism,"" of which the alter-globalization movement in an example par excellence, most of this literature neglects what are arguably more pressing questions regarding the ways in which contemporary social actors conceptualize and organize time, and the implications of these hegemonic temporal norms for patterns of <b>collective</b> action. To <b>redress</b> this gap, this study evaluates the social, cultural and political implications for activism of the process of time-space compression, driven by the basic dynamics of capitalism and facilitated by digital communication technologies. Using evidence collected from semi-structured interviews, it therefore not only offers the first systematic and in-depth account of the history (and pre-history) of the Canadian alter-globalization movement, it also demonstrates that the social acceleration of time facilitated by new media technologies encourages a tendency toward ""fast activism"" by diminishing three activist time-related practices in particular: building sustained movement infrastructure, learning from the past, that is, collective memory, and thinking reflexively about the future, that is, long-term strategic planning. The study's conclusion offers some tentative suggestions for improving the political capacities and potentials of today's anti-status quo troublemakers. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>redress</b> congregates {{claims of}} a group of claimants with similar factual and legal issues {{together}} in one action. It is introduced in consumer litigation primarily to overcome the weakness of expensive and time-consuming court proceedings in small claims in order to increase consumers' access to justice.

The European Commission is currently examining existing <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms in the Member States, exploring effective and efficient means to address mass claims of consumers. During the process of the Commission's project in <b>collective</b> <b>redress,</b> a special question has gradually attracted stakeholders' attention, which is how the <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> would work in a cross-border context.

40|$|This Working Paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> as a possible way to defend workers’ rights in the EU. Since {{the implementation of the}} internal market and the development of the Community acquis trade unions and the workers they represent in Europe are confronted with the question how to defend workers’ rights that can be derived from EU law, especially in a cross-border context. Although in theory it is often claimed that foreign workers have access to justice and can address to local courts like any other worker the practice is rather patchy. In the first exploratory contribution Jan Cremers describes the latest developments in the European Union related to the cross-border enforcement of workers’ rights. The notion of <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> is introduced with a short explanation of the position of the trade unions. After an exploration of practical experiences the article ends with an overview of challenges and open questions that have led to further desktop research. Martin Bulla investigated whether <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> can provide a possible way of improvement of judicial enforcement of posted workers’ rights vested in the Posting of Workers Directive (Directive 96 / 71 /EC). The contribution starts with the most significant problems posted workers are facing, followed by an overview of basic types of <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> procedures as well as differences in approaches to legal regulation in countries. EU initiatives dealing with the issue of <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mainly related to consumer law are examined and existing legal instruments are addressed with a view to a possible use for enhancement of posted workers’ rights. Finally an overview of ways of applying redress procedures under the existing legislation is followed by proposals concerning a better functioning of <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> in respect to posted workers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of the 2013 Commission?s Communication and Recommendation on <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms by combining the theory of input/output legitimacy with the EU legal concept of effectiveness. In particular, this paper asks first, whether the inputs provided by the European Parliament and stakeholders {{in the course of the}} policy-making process of private enforcement of competition law and of <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> had an impact on the EU rules currently adopted; and second, whether such inputs have increased rather than decreased {{the effectiveness of}} these rules. The paper shows that the European Parliament and stakeholders? positions are reflected in the adopted rules. As for the impact of such inputs in terms of more, rather than less, effectiveness, the assessment seems to point to a decreased effectiveness of these rules, which is reflected in the adoption of soft-law, which means that the Member States may not adopt it, and in the capability of these rules to promote compliance with Article 101 and 102 TFEU. However, this paper also shows that the European Parliament and stakeholders? inputs highlighted the need that the <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> rules should respect some important legal values that make the judicial decision-making process legitimate. This is an important precondition for the proper application of the new rules on <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> by the legal community, which in turn is likely to make such rules effective...|$|E
40|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>redress</b> is a {{procedural}} mechanism {{that allows for}} reasons of procedural economy and efficiency of enforcement many similar legal claims to be combined into a single court action. Consumers and investors encounter problems with the enforcement of their rights through the individual redress, especially in times of the financial crisis. If {{a substantial number of}} harmed individuals decide not to pursue their, usually low, claims, the unduly gained profits of the opposite party can be extremely high. Thus, <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms can represent better option for consumers and investors, as their claims tend to be much less burdensome in case of the collective action. However, such mechanisms can trigger the abuse of the procedures, with the most commonly quoted threat being the example of American regulation of class actions. Negative characteristics of American model are the reasons that EU decided to shape its own concept of <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms. The binding act in this field in the EU is directive on injunctions for the protection of consumers’ interests; however, there is no binding act yet regarding compensatory actions. In June 2013, the European Commission published the Recommendation on common principles for injunctive and compensatory <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms in the Member States concerning violations of rights granted under Union Law. It is not binding on Member States, however, it can serve as a guideline to improve their existing legislations, especially the regulation of collective compensatory actions.

40|$|The {{technological}} developments {{that led to}} mass production and globalisation also changed the law. As {{it is not uncommon}} for individuals to be harmed in identical or similar ways by mass-produced products and standardised corporate practices, mechanisms are needed to cope with these new situations. This has been reflected by the introduction of product liability laws around the world. In addition to substantive law being adjusted to these developments, entire legal systems must also be changed. <b>Collective</b> <b>redress</b> is the procedural counterpart that mirrors these changes in substantive law. Current procedural provisions were created in the light of two-party litigation and cannot cope with multi-party situations. Therefore, a mechanism of <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> is being introduced globally. On 11 June 2013, the European Commission published a series of common, non-binding principles for <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms in European Union member states in the form of a Recommendation. Member states were invited to implement the principles set out in the Recommendation by 26 July 2015. Currently, the relatively new European mechanisms vary significantly, and although the broad rules of the Recommendation are unlikely to change this situation, the Recommendation aims to create a coherent approach in terms of <b>collective</b> <b>redress.</b> A comparison of the different regimes will uncover weaknesses and help to evaluate and improve the Recommendation. As the European Commission rejects ‘United States (US) style’ class actions for entrepreneurial litigation caused by contingency fees, punitive damages and the American rule of costs, Australia provides with their unavailability a great object of comparison. Having conducted class actions for almost 25 years, Australia can be regarded as one of the most developed countries—alongside the US and Canada—in relation to <b>collective</b> <b>redress.</b> A comparison of the existing mechanisms in Europe and Australia will provide an overview of how the major difficulties of class actions are handled, such as the rational apathy of claimants, free riders and the avoidance of unmeritorious claims. After introducing the topic in the first section of the thesis, the second section will analyse the existing mechanisms on the basis of national reports. The legal developments concerning <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> will be analysed, and a summary of the current developments will be provided. Drawing upon the outcome of the second section, the third section will compare the similarities and differences between the various legal systems, and it will evaluate the different approaches by focusing on the major difficulties.

40|$|In {{line with}} primary EU {{competition}} law, the new Damages Directive 2014 / 104 /EU aims {{to provide all}} victims of competition law violations with a right to compensation. This includes consumers who often suffer harm {{at the very end}} of the supply chain. This article analyses the impact of this Directive on consumer redress. Thereby, it identifies a tension built into the Directive between the public interest in enhancing the respect of competition law, on the one hand, and the private interest in compensating the victims of anti-competitive conduct, on the other hand. By concentrating the right to claim damages on the — direct or indirect — purchaser who ultimately had to pay the overcharge, the Directive runs the risk that infringers of competition law will escape private enforcement actions in cases where this overcharge was passed down to final consumers who, especially in mass damage cases, will not have sufficient incentives to bring individual damage claims to the courts. This problem is aggravated by the fact that the Damages Directive itself does not provide for any <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms. Rather, in 2013, the Commission decided to address that issue only through adopting the non-binding <b>Collective</b> <b>Redress</b> Recommendation. Thereby, the Commission recommends avoiding all the features that make up the so-called ‘toxic cocktail’ of US class actions. Yet past experience and most recent reforms in some Member States seem to indicate that pure systems of opt-in <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms will not significantly contribute to private enforcement of competition law. Indeed, for the time being, experimenting with different national systems is the best approach to identifying the best system of <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> for competition law cases...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} the first {{in-depth}} academic discussion of the key aspects of the enhanced <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms introduced recently in relation to competition law infringements in the UK by the Consumer Rights Act. The legislation is a particularly significant development because of the historical and contemporary focus on the ‘consumer’ {{at the heart of}} competition/antitrust law and because the reforms also reflect more recent debates generally in legal practice about ‘access to justice’. The article first recounts the pivotal role played by ‘class actions’ in US antitrust enforcement before outlining the recent debate on encouraging and facilitating private enforcement in the EU, particularly in relation to <b>collective</b> <b>redress,</b> culminating in the (anodyne) Commission Recommendation of June 2013. As the article notes, most of the <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms introduced across the EU Member States to date have been opt-in models, but these have been criticised for their limited impact and effectiveness, and an opt-out representative model has been introduced in some Member States and discussed in others. The article will reflect on the limited provision in the UK on <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> in relation to competition law infringements prior to the Consumer Rights Act, in particular the limitations in the opt-in follow-on procedure under s 47 B of the Competition Act 1998, as demonstrated by CA v JJB. The article will then focus on the Act’s provisions (and associated Tribunal rules) in relation to opt-in/opt-out collective proceedings and settlements (in both follow-on and stand-alone actions). The article will outline the new statutory provisions in sections 47 B and 49 A and B of the Competition Act 1998, for Collective Proceedings and Collective Settlements respectively. The Tribunal rules on certification will be considered, noting the potential difficulties in their practical application, before further analysis of two key problematic aspects of the proposed opt-out <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> scheme, which may limit its effectiveness and uptake. The first concerns the appointment of the class/settlement representative and the second concerns the potential funding arrangements in relation to opt-out collective proceedings. The article questions whether the combination of these two aspects may dis-incentivise and unnecessarily limit the effectiveness of the new opt-out provisions, although it is accepted that this will also greatly depend on the Competition Appeal Tribunal interpretation and application of its new Tribunal Rules in relation to Collective proceedings, in particular regarding certification, appointment of the class/settlement representative and determination of the appropriate costs and expenses incurred in pursuing a collective claim...|$|E

Thus far, no unified European class action mechanism has been developed, and only some member states have developed their own systems.

Central to my work, therefore, is the belief that collective actions constitute an attractive vehicle to solve, or at least diminish, the inefficienciesof antitrust enforcement. The paper explores some options as to how to design <b>collective</b> <b>redress</b> mechanisms in order to influence the ability to bring successful collective claims. This would, in turn, consider the advantages of opt-out collective actions in tackling the issues related to low participation rates, lack of funding and sub-optimal deterrence. From this perspective, the article moves on to propose collective actions as a potential remedy to facilitate access to justice, to deal with a wide range of legal and economic issues and to mitigate dysfunctional compensatory mechanism of EU antitrust enforcement...|$|E
