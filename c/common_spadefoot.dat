Its natural habitats are tropical moist lowland forests, rivers, freshwater marshes, and nearby plantations and heavily degraded former forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{plasticity}} {{is found}} in most organisms, but its role in evolution remains controversial. Environmentally induced phenotypic differences may be translated into adaptive divergence among lineages experiencing different environmental conditions through genetic accommodation. To examine this evolutionary mechanism, we studied the relationship between plasticity in larval development, postmetamorphic morphology, and morphological diversity in spadefoot toads, a group of closely related species that are highly divergent in the larval period and body shape and are distributed throughout temperate areas of both the New and the Old World. Previous studies showed that accelerated metamorphosis is adaptive for desert-dwelling spadefoot toads. We show that even under <b>common</b> garden conditions, <b>spadefoot</b> toad species show divergent reaction norms for the larval period. In addition, experimentally induced changes in the larval period caused correlated morphological changes in postmetamorphic individuals such that long larval periods resulted in relatively longer hindlimbs and snouts. A comparative analysis of morphological variation across spadefoot toad species also revealed {{a positive correlation between}} the larval period and limb and snout lengths, mirroring the effects of within-species plasticity at a higher taxonomic level. Indeed, after ≈ 110 Ma of independent evolution, differences in the larval period explain 57 % of the variance in relative limb length and 33 % of snout length across species. Thus, morphological diversity across these species appears to have evolved as a correlated response to selection for a reduced larval period in desert-dwelling species, possibly diverging from ancestral plasticity through genetic accommodation...|$|R

50|$|The {{eastern spadefoot}} {{is native to}} Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Macedonia, Romania, Russian Federation, Serbia, Syria and Turkey. It is quite common in Iran but is {{uncommon}} over much of its range. It {{is thought to be}} extinct in Jordan and its status is unclear in Albania, Iraq, Moldova and Ukraine. It lives in light woodland, bushy and semi-desert areas, badlands, arable fields and dunes. It prefers loose soil where it can use its spades to dig the burrow in which it lives, but is also found in rocky areas and pebbly clay soils. The range of eastern spadefoot is limited by mean annual temperature and rainfall (the species does not live in the areas with insufficient summer temperature and in areas with a high rainfall level), but the northern distribution limit may additionally depend on the distribution of <b>common</b> <b>spadefoot.</b> Because the species has large tadpoles, the distribution is additionally limited by presence of sufficiently large but fishless ponds.|$|E
50|$|The {{eastern spadefoot}} is a plump toad {{with a large}} head with a flat topped skull, large, {{protruding}} eyes and vertical slit-like pupils. It can grow to a length of about 9 cm. The skin is smooth with a scattering of small warts. The male has a large gland {{at the back of}} his fore legs which becomes enlarged in the breeding season. The front foot has four toes and the back foot has five with deeply indented webbing between them. The hind legs are short and at the back of each hind foot is a yellowish bony protuberance, the inner metatarsal tubercle or spade, that gives the animal its name. The colour of the frog is quite variable, the back often being pale grey with large, greenish, irregularly shaped blotches and the belly being pale grey. The eastern spadefoot can be distinguished from the western spadefoot (Pelobates cultripes) by the colour of the spade which is black in the latter, and from the <b>common</b> <b>spadefoot</b> (Pelobates fuscus) by the fact that its head is not domed.|$|E

40|$|During a {{long-term}} {{study of the}} amphibian fauna on an artificial island near Vienna (Austria), one isolated site was completely encircled with a permanent drift fence and pitfall traps. Eleven amphibian species occurred at the study site. For the <b>Common</b> <b>Spadefoot</b> Toad (Pelobates fuscus) and for the Danube Crested Newt (Triturus dobrogicus). individuals could be recognized by photographing the highly variable dorsal/ventral patterns. Daily patrols of the drift fence, for 6 years since 1986, enabled us to monitor the demography and dynamics of these two species. For T. dobrogicus, the adult part of the censused population decreased from 207 to 87 individuals during the first 2 years of investigation and then remained stable. Pelobates fuscus showed a constant decrease over 6 years, from 626 to 62 individuals. Juveniles were produced annually; a massive increase in this age class was observed for both species {{during the period of}} investigation.

30|$|Glyphosate-based {{herbicides}} {{are currently}} applied at various time points or periods {{over the year}} [5]. As shown in Figure  1, these can coincide {{with the presence of}} all developmental stages of the four amphibian species observed on fields, no matter if being preterm or stable. However, in all species, the risk of exposure is clearly reduced in preterm populations. This becomes clear when comparing the total number of pentads per species representing the time phase of reproductive behaviour (i.e. all developmental stages pooled) with the total number of pentads in which glyphosate-based herbicides can be applied (Figure  1). In our verbal model, possible exposure decreases for about 50 % in the early breeders when preterm (common frog 14 to 6 pentads, common toad 14 to 8 pentads) and also in the late breeders the decrease is moderate (green toad 38 to 27 pentads, <b>common</b> <b>spadefoot</b> 20 to 13 pentads). Early in the year, regarding possible exposure risk during pre-sowing/pre-emerging in spring, the improvement of preterm reproduction is only slight in all four species and affects adults as well as eggs. More evident, potential glyphosate applications in summer with siccation and stubble cultivation do no longer or less coincide with late larval and juvenile stages of species when preterm.|$|E
30|$|Effect of {{pesticides}} on the terrestrial life phase (Carsten Brühl, University of Koblenz-Landau Several amphibian species like the fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) or the <b>common</b> <b>spadefoot</b> (Pelobates fuscus) inhabit the agricultural landscape during their summer activity period, resulting in possible terrestrial exposure [2]. Owing to {{the biology of}} the species, {{it is to be}} expected that dermal exposure is the major route of exposure [17, 18]. The skin of amphibians has a unique structure and function that is not comparable to that of mammals. Since it is considerably more permeable, amphibians are more vulnerable to PPPs than other terrestrial vertebrates. The susceptibility of terrestrial amphibians has not yet been described to any great extent, although some studies have shown that PPPs at environmentally relevant concentrations can be toxic for terrestrial life stages of amphibians [19]. Postmetamorphic juvenile European common frogs were directly sprayed with different PPPs in a laboratory study. The mortality of the animals in the case of all seven PPP formulations investigated (4 fungicides, 2 herbicides and 1 insecticide) was high, reaching 100  % at field application rates and 40  % at 10  % field application rate, despite the fact that products and application quantities authorised in Germany and Switzerland have been tested [19]. The authors have noted that in addition to the active substance, co-formulants can also decisively influence the toxicity of PPPs to amphibians.|$|E
40|$|THE GRASS SNAKE IN THE WORM RIVER VALLEY: A BORDERLINE CASE The Grass snake (Natrix natrix) has {{recently}} recolonised the Dutch {{part of the}} valley of the river Worm (situated on the border between the Netherlands and Germany) from source populations across the German border. In the 1980 s they disappeared from the Dutch part of the valley due to habitat destruction {{as a result of the}} construction of a NATO goods depot. The species was rediscovered in 2005, which led to the construction of artificial breeding sites (breeding heaps) on the Dutch side of the Worm. Since then, dozens of Grass snakes have been sighted and the numbers of eggs deposited in the breeding heaps have been increasing each year. At the moment, the Grass snake uses the Dutch bank of the Worm for foraging and egg deposition, and there is no evidence that it hibernates on the Dutch side. Stimulating further colonisation of areas in Limburg by means of specific management measures requires careful consideration, in view of the importance of the province of Limburg for rare and threatened amphibians like the Tree frog (Hyla arborea), the <b>Common</b> <b>spadefoot</b> (Pelobatus fuscus) and the Midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans), which are potential preys for Grass snakes. What makes the situation interesting from a herpetogeographical point of view is that the Grass snakes in the Worm valley could have a completely different origin than the other Dutch populations, underlining the region’s reputation in terms of the national herpetofauna...|$|E
40|$|This thesis pursues {{amphibian}} biotop {{preferences in}} locations where moldavites were quarried in the past. Field work {{took place in}} two localities near Trhové Sviny. The first one is situated {{near the village of}} Slavče where an illegal extraction still occures,. The second locality is found by the village of Dobrkovská Lhotka. This locality was partially recultivated in 2010. The aim of this work was to establish which factors do influence different amphibian species in the both studied locations. There were found five various species of amphibians near the village of Slavče: the Common frog (Rana temporaria), the Edible frog (Pelophylax kl. esculentus), the European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina), the European tree frog (Hyla arborea) and the Common toad (Bufo bufo). The results were statistically evaluated. Based on them it was established that the Common frog prefers the herb layer, the European Fire-bellied toad prefers semi shaded medium sized pools that do not dry up. The European tree frog and the Edible frog prefer large areas of pools and ponds. More over the edible frog demands ponds that are partially overgrown. The Common toad was represented only with one single individual. Therefore a statistical analasys could not be executed. The whole locality is negatively influenced by local inhabitants who gather here manure and organic waste from their gardens. On locality located near to Dobrkovská Lhotka was transformed from a mining landscape to a pond and three pools. All amphibian species that lived in the locality before reclamation were still present here. Occurrence of <b>Common</b> <b>spadefoot</b> (Pelobates fuscus) was confirmed by the unique finding of a tadpole.

40|$|Goal Determine {{presence}} of the zoosporic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, the causative agent of the amphibian skin disease chytridiomycosis, in free ranging amphibians in the Netherlands and Flanders (Belgium) Methods Volunteers and professionals collected data from free ranging amphibians by stroking 3 – 5 times with a sterile cotton-tipped dryswab over {{the underside of the}} legs, feet and drink patch. All amphibians were individually sampled. Hygienic measurements were taken to prevent cross-infection. Quantitative real-time TaqMan PCR assays were performed for the determination of Bd infections. A total of 2, 771 swabs were collected between August – October 2008 (American bullfrogs in Flanders) and between March – September 2009 (all species in the Netherlands and in Flanders). Samples were collected in all provinces and all species apart from the marsh frog were sampled. Results Bd infected amphibians have been found all over the Netherlands, in all provinces apart from Groningen, Zuid-Holland and Zeeland. A total of 4 % of all amphibians in the Netherlands (3. 7 %) and Belgium (5. 4 %) are infected with Bd. Critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable amphibian species are infected Bd was found in all native species apart from the <b>common</b> <b>spadefoot</b> (low sample size) and the mars frog (no data collected). The smooth newt was the most sampled species of all amphibians. None of the infected individuals showed any visible symptoms. We carefully suggest that Bd can be found in all amphibians over the whole of the Netherlands. Discussion & recommendations No data on prevalence can be calculated due to ad hoc sampling and the impact of Bd infections on native species is yet unknown. Phylogenetic analyses of Bd haplotypes will give insight in the virulence of the strains and the process of invasion into the Netherlands and Flanders. Studying the relationship between aquatic stress and the virulence of Bd will help in the determination of the true risk for the survival of amphibian populations as well as the study of the ecology of Bd in the European temperate climate zone. Simultaneously, vulnerable populations like the midwife toad should be monitored intensively to prevent catastrophic declines that cannot be reversed. We face the enormous challenge to define the true impact of Bd infection on native amphibians and at the same time, find means of prevention and cure to sustain amphibian populations...|$|E
