Nonlinear forecasting indicates that at beach cusp horns, the behaviour of swash flow is more predictable and global (meaning that characteristics of individual swash events are well represented by the behaviour of the timeseries as a whole). Conversely, at beach cusp bays, the behaviour of swash flow is less predictable and more local (meaning that the characteristics of individual swash events are best represented by the behaviour of {{a small fraction of}} the timeseries). Bispectral analysis indicates that there is a nonlinear transfer of energy from the incident wave frequency f to infragravity frequency ~f/ 2 which only occurs in the bay, suggesting that the local behaviour is caused by interactions between successive swash cycles which are magnified by channelling caused by the beach <b>cusp</b> <b>geometry.</b> The local behaviour and the bispectral signatures are not present in offshore measurements, and are not present in runup timeseries collected when the beach was planar.

Limited data exist for reconstruction in specific pathologies with isolated cusp pathology. We analyzed the results of aortic valve repair in patients with aortic regurgitation caused by myxomatous cusp prolapse in the presence of tricuspid valve anatomy and normal root size. MethodsOver a 12 -year period, 111 patients underwent aortic valve reconstruction for regurgitant tricuspid aortic valves without concomitant root dilatation. Cusp prolapse was caused by myxomatous degeneration in 72 subjects (group I) and associated with fenestrations in 39 subjects (group II). Prolapse was corrected by means of plication of the free margin in the presence of normal cusp tissue only (n = 62) or combined with triangular resection of cusp tissue (n = 10). It was treated with additional closure of the fenestration with autologous pericardium in 39 instances (group II). Follow-up was complete in 98. 5 % (cumulative 385 years). ResultsHospital mortality was 1. 8 %, and during follow-up, there was 1 thromboembolic event and no endocarditis. Freedom from reoperation at 5 and 8 years was 96 %. ConclusionsIsolated cusp prolapse is a relevant cause of aortic regurgitation in tricuspid aortic valves without concomitant root dilatation. In myxomatous stretching of cusp tissue, plication of the free margin suffices to restore <b>cusp</b> <b>geometry</b> and aortic valve function.

To evaluate {{the quality of}} a tool path (i. e. the remaining material, commonly referred to as cusps), machining tests must usually be performed. If the tests prove to be unsatisfactory, new tool paths must be generated and run. In this paper, a new approach for modeling cusps is presented which makes use of recent advances in vector algebraic computation of swept volumes. The method uses the computer’s graphics card to compute the <b>cusp</b> <b>geometry</b> from the swept volumes. The algorithm was verified with a machining test by measuring the cusp height between two adjacent passes with a Coordinate Measuring Machine and comparing it to the modeled cusp height. machining, modeling the surface that will be generated by a tool path is more difficult than for 3 -axis. The simplicity of 3 -axis machining allows for the development of simplified algorithms to compute and visualize the surface resulting from a tool path. Unfortunately, these simplifications cannot easily be generalized to 5 -axis tool motion. Gouge {{checking and}} measuring for 5 -axis tool paths has been a widely researched area [13]. However, gouge checking only measures the error of a tool path and does not measure its quality. To determine the quality, researchers usually perform a machining test to measure cusp heights (the material remaining on the workpiece between adjacent passes of the tool). If the test proves to be unsatisfactory, the researcher must compute new tool paths adding more tool passes and perform a new machining test. byCategories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R

This paper presents observations of the dayside ionosphere from SuperDARN HF radars in Antarctica during an extended interval (~ 12 h) of quasi-steady IMF conditions (By ~ Bz < 0). The observations show a quasi-stationary feature in the SWB in the morning sector close to magnetic local noon which {{takes the form of a}} 2 ° poleward distortion of the boundary.

The comparison of these density measurements, obtained from 44 flare episodes (during 14 different flares), demonstrates the compatibility of flare plasma density diagnostics with SXR and radio methods. The density in the upflowing plasma {{is found to}} be somewhat lower than in the filled loops, having ratios in a range n(sub e, sup upflow) /n(sub e, sup SXR) = 0. 02 - 1. 3, and a factor of 3. 6 higher behind the upflow front. The acceleration sites are found to have a much lower density than the SXR-bright flare loops, i. e., n(sub e, sup acc) /n(sub e, sup SXR) = 0. 005 - 0. 13, and thus must be physically displaced from the SXR-bright flare loops.

Lively discussions of such matters as plasma drift in a torus and its effect on achieving a laboratory thermonuclear reac-tion occurred between Fermi, Kerst, Landshoff, Teller, R. R.

When the subject was reopened in 1951, the toroidal pinch (as proposed, with a superimposed Bz field, by the writer in 1948) was selected as the confinement geometry for initial study and it passed through the usual vicissitudes and modifications— instability, linear dynamic pinches (Columbus), rf pinches, so called Bz and wall stabilized pinches; while parallel speculations and experimental forays were made into <b>cusped</b> <b>geometries</b> (Picket Fence), spinning plasmas, shocks in axial and convergent geometries and magnetic mirrors.

The question addressed was whether the reimplantation (David) technique or the remodeling (Yacoub) technique provides the optimum event free survival in patients with an aortic root aneurysm suitable for an aortic valve-sparing operation. In total, 392 papers were found using the reported search criteria, of which 14 papers provided the {{best evidence}} to answer the clinical question. A total of 1338 patients (Yacoub technique in 606 and David technique in 732) from 13 centres were included. In most series, cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time were longer for the David technique compared to the Yacoub technique. Early mortality was comparable between the two techniques (0 - 6. 9 % for the Yacoub technique and 0 - 6 % for the David technique). There is a tendency for a higher freedom from significant long-term aortic insufficiency in the David group than the Yacoub group, which does not necessarily result in a higher reoperation rate in the Yacoub group. In the largest series reported, freedom from a moderate-to-severe aortic insufficiency at 12 years was 82. 6 ± 6. 2 % in the Yacoub and 91. 0 ± 3. 8 % in the David group (P = 0. 035). Freedom from reoperation {{at the same time}} point was 90. 4 ± 4. 7 % in the Yacoub group and 97. 4 ± 2. 2 % in the David group (P = 0. 09).

40|$|This study {{primarily}} {{investigated the}} flow and aeroacoustics {{associated with the}} slat of a three-element aerofoil in approach conditions. The study assessed importance of several factors and examined their aerodynamic impacts. The factors investigated were aerofoil incidence, slat angle, slat <b>cusp</b> <b>geometry,</b> fixing transition and blowing in the slat cove. A combination of experimental and computational techniques investigated the factors selected. The experimental work employed PIV, pressure tap, a force balance, flush mounted microphones and an acoustic array. The computational work used DES along with the FW-H acoustic analogy to obtain the far-field directivity. Tonal features occurred at high incidence and originated at the slat trailing edge, due to the blunt trailing edge and gap, and at the reattachment point. Fixing transition removes the tone at the reattachment point and reduces the slat gap tone at the trailing edge but does not remove the tone generated by the blunt trailing edge. All of the tones found, only occurred at certain slat and wing settings. Broadband sound was present in all conditions but had a strong dependence on the incidence of the wing. The sound was loudest with the wing at ? = 5 o with a reduction as the wing incidence was increased. The broadband sound also reduced as the slat angel decreased from ?S = 23 o. The shear incidence angle was a good indicator {{of the impact of}} these two factors on the sound generated. Extending the slat cusp reduced the broadband sound at low aerofoil incidence. However, for ? ? 10 o the extension led to increased broadband sound. Neither blowing nor fixing transition {{had a significant impact on}} the broadband sound generated by the slat system. The aerodynamic loads generated by the wing were mainly dependent on the aerofoil incidence. However, other factors did influence the forces generated.

40|$|The cusp {{energetic}} particle (CEP) {{event is}} a new magnetospheric phenomenon. The events were detected in the dayside cusp for hours, in which the measured helium ions had energies up to 8 MeV. All of these events were associated with a dramatic decrease and large fluctuations in the local magnetic field strength. During January 1999 - December 1999 covered by this report, I have studied the CEP events by analyzing the POLAR, GEOTAIL, and WIND particle and magnetic field data measured during the geomagnetic quiet periods in 1996 and one geomagnetic storm period in 1998. The simultaneous observations indicated that the ion fluxes in the CEP events were higher than that in both the upstream and the downstream from the bow shock. The pitch angle distribution of the helium ions in the CEP events was found to peak around 90 deg. It {{was found that the}} mirror parameter, defined as the ratio of the square root of the integration of the parallel turbulent power spectral component over the ultra-low frequency (ULF) ranges to the mean field in the cusp, is correlated with the intensity of the cusp MeV helium flux, which {{is a measure of the}} influence of mirroring interactions and an indication of local effect. It was also found that the turbulent power of the local magnetic field in the ultra-low frequency (ULF) ranges is correlated with the intensity of the cusp energetic helium ions. Such ULF ranges correspond to periods of about 0. 33 - 500 seconds that cover the gyroperiods, the bounce periods, and the drift periods of the tens keV to MeV charged particles when they are temporarily confined in the high-altitude dayside cusp. These observations represent a discovery that the high-altitude dayside cusp {{is a new}} acceleration and dynamic trapping region of the magnetosphere.

The ability of these cells to deform and navigate through the capillary beds is of fundamental importance for proper functioning of the cardiovascular transport system. The erythrocyte is essentially a capsule, and flow-induced erythrocyte deformation involves the interfacial dynamics of a membrane-enclosed fluid volume stressed in a viscous flow. Elastic capsule dynamics is a complicated problem involving the coupling of fluid and membrane forces; it is also found in a variety of scientific and engineering applications. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of elastic capsules and erythrocytes using the Spectral Boundary Element (SBE) method, a high-order / high-accuracy method for capsule and cellular dynamics. For strain-hardening Skalak elastic capsules in an extensional flow, our investigations demonstrate a shape transition in accordance with experimental observations to a cusped conformation at high flow rates, which allows the capsule to withstand the increased hydrodynamic forces. Our computational methodology reveals a region of bifurcation, in which both spindled and <b>cusped</b> steady-state <b>geometries</b> coexist for a single flow rate. The method is also used to investigate the dynamics of strain-softening Neohookean capsules in the same flow pattern. The strain-softening capsules become highly extended at weaker flow rates than strain-hardening capsules, and do not form steady-state cusped shapes. The SBE method has been extended to model the erythrocyte by using a biconcave disc reference geometry and adaptive prestress to enforce area incompressibility. The method accurately reproduces experimental data from erythrocyte ektacytometry, but allows examination of the erythrocyte dynamics beyond the geometric constraints inherent in ektacytometry and other experimental techniques, including observation of the three-dimensional oscillatory behavior over a range of capillary numbers and viscosity ratios. Our results support a prediction by Fischer, Skalak, and coworkers that the erythrocyte shear modulus decreases at small shear deformations. Our work also suggests that cellular deformation is largely independent of the flow pattern, consistent with the findings of experimental investigators...|$|R
40|$|A flow {{visualization}} was {{studied by}} using neutrally buoyant, helium-filled soap bubbles, {{to determine the}} effect of injection hole geometry on the trajectory of an air jet in a crossflow and to investigate the mechanisms involved in jet deflection. Experimental variables were the blowing rate, and the injection hole <b>geometry</b> <b>cusp</b> facing upstream (CUS), cusp facing downstream (CDS), round, swirl passage, and oblong. It is indicated that jet deflection is governed by both the pressure drag forces and the entrainment of free-stream fluid into the jet flow. For injection hole geometries with similar cross-sectional areas and similar mass flow rates, the jet configuration with the larger aspect ratio experienced a greater deflection. Entrainment arises from lateral shearing forces {{on the sides of the}} jet, which set up a dual vortex motion within the jet and thereby cause some of the main-stream fluid momentum to be swept into the jet flow. This additional momentum forces the jet nearer the surface. Of the jet configurations, the oblong, CDS, and CUS configurations exhibited the largest deflections. The results correlate well with film cooling effectiveness data, which suggests a need to determine the jet exit configuration of optimum aspect ratio to provide maximum film cooling effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} simulation code (ffx) {{designed to}} analyze ion thruster optics is described. It {{is an extension}} of an earlier code and includes special features like the ability to model a wide range of grid <b>geometries,</b> <b>cusp</b> details, and mis-aligned aperture pairs to name a few. However, the principle reason for advancing the code was in the study of ion optics erosion. Ground based testing of ion thruster optics, essential {{to the understanding of the}} processes of grid erosion, can be time consuming and costly. Simulation codes that can accurately predict grid lifetimes and the physical mechanisms of grid erosion can be of great utility in the development of future ion thruster optics designed for more ambitious applications. Results of simulations are presented that describe wear profiles for several standard and non-standard aperture geometries, such as those grid sets with square- or slotted-hole layout patterns. The goal of this paper will be to introduce the methods employed in the ffx code and to briefly demonstrate their use. THE FFX CODE Many simulation codes have been developed to study various aspects of ion thruster optics. One such code is the igx code, developed by Nakayama and Wilbur for the high-speed, three-dimensional analysis of grid sets with axially aligned, hexagonal aperture layouts. 1 This code has been shown to agre...|$|R
40|$|Fluid diodes are fluidic {{devices that}} enhance fluid flow in a {{particular}} direction while inhibiting it {{in the opposite direction}} without the use of moving parts. This is accomplished through the use of nozzle shaped geometry {{on one side of the}} diode, and <b>cusp</b> shaped <b>geometry</b> on the opposing side. Fluid meets very little resistance as is travels though the nozzle side of the diode. The cusps on the other side of the diode reduce the effective flow area, thereby inhibiting flow. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a fluid diode installed in a reconstructed cardiovascular system of an infant diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The fluid diode is not used inside the heart, but rather inside a shunt connecting the ventricle to the pulmonary artery. Currently, patients are experiencing regurgitant blood flow inside this shunt, which is known as a Sano shunt. This regurgitant volume increases the workload of the ventricle, which can lead to myocardial hypertrophy and eventual cardiac failure [1, 2]. The principle objective of this thesis is to characterize the performance of certain diodes by testing them experimentally using a mock circulatory system. Experiments were performed on three different size diodes-in-shunts as well as three different size empty shunts. The data from each diode-in-shunt test was compared to the data from each empty shunt test in order to determine if any performance gain was present. The regurgitant fraction (RF%) as well as the individual systolic and diastolic flow volumes were used to evaluate the performance of both the diodes-in-shunts as well as the empty shunts. The earlier experiments were conducted with the diode situated in the middle of the shunt. By moving the diode to the entrance of the shunt, the RF% was improved by as much as 51 %. However, with only three different size diodes-in-shunts as well as three different size empty shunts available for testing, it is hard to draw any definitive conclusions as to whether or not a diode can maintain the same systolic flow levels while reducing diastolic flow levels. Further testing using different diameter diodes is required. Advisor: Kevin Col...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the mechanism of venous valve closure in physiologic conditions in situ, particularly the clarification of the role of reversed flow through the valve in the closure of the valve cusps. A second purpose was the study of temporal relations between movements of the valve <b>cusps,</b> changes in <b>geometry</b> of venous sinus, and blood flow. Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers underwent examination with duplex ultrasound scanning. The time relationship between the flow and venous valve movements was analyzed on the basis of real time ultrasound scan records of the saphenofemoral junction. The size and shape of the common femoral vein and the proximal greater saphenous vein were measured with a planimeter. Results: Reverse flow below the valve was registered in only one of the 12 studied subjects. The maximum peak velocity of the reverse flow in this case was 0. 8 cm/s and the duration was 0. 2 seconds. The reverse flow was registered just before and just after valve closure. The mean duration of the outflow wave below the valve was 816 ± 57 ms, which was not significantly different {{from the time of the}} valve cycle (819 ± 55 ms; P =. 864). The closure of the valve coincided with the decrease of the flow velocities. The first detectable movement of the valve cusps occurred 108 ± 21 ms after the beginning of the flow deceleration. The mean time interval from the first cusp movement to the complete closure of the valve was 139 ± 51 ms. Both the size and the shape of the sinus changed during the valve cycle. The size of the sinus increased as much as 127 % of the baseline value (1. 79 ± 0. 25 cm at baseline; 2. 27 ± 0. 23 cm maximum; P =. 02), and it became more spheric in shape. The changes in size and shape of the sinus coincided with the movements of the valve cusps. The first detectable change in the sinus size occurred 80 ± 30 ms after the first detectable movement of the cusps toward closure. Conclusion: Reverse flow through the valve is not necessary for the closure of the venous valve. The closure of the venous valve coincides with the decrease of the flow velocities and the ballooning of the sinus (increase of size and the curvature of the valve sinus).
