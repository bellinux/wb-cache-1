40|$|When {{listening}} to music, the ear is the <b>closest</b> <b>organ</b> {{to be exposed}} to sound. The external auditory canal of the ear is colonised by normal flora such as Staphylococcus aureus, which is inevitably exposed to sound waves. In an immunocompromised patient, a change in the equilibrium of the microflora would be detrimental. This study aims to determine whether S. aureus undergoes any phenotypic or genotypic changes after exposure to various types of sounds. S. aureus was exposed to sounds produced from two musical instruments i. e. acoustic and electrical; and solo vocalisation. A non-exposed group was included as a control. The bacteria in liquid medium were exposed to the sounds while incubating at 37 °C. After nine hours of exposure to the various types of sound, the bacteria were evaluated for any changes in phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. Results showed that there was no change in the growth pattern of the bacteria although the growth rate was enhanced in all the exposed groups. However, there was no change in their morphology, biochemical properties and susceptibility to three antibiotics. The biofilm production of the bacteria increased following the exposure to all types of sound. Protein profile of the acoustic and electrical instrument groups showed a deletion of a 30 to 32 kDa protein but the nucleotide sequences of seven housekeeping genes of the bacteria were not altered. In conclusion, exposure of S. aureus to audible sounds produced by acoustic and electrical instruments, as well as solo vocalisation resulted in some changes in their biological characteristics...|$|R

40|$|This {{review paper}} {{is devoted to}} {{conventional}} radiotherapy and to hadron therapy. In this therapeutical modality, proposed by R. R. Wilson in 1946, the physical selectivity of proton and light ion beams is used to irradiate tissues very <b>close</b> to <b>organs</b> at risk, which cannot be irradiated (the brain and the spinal cord for instance). Also fast neutrons are employed, {{but they are not}} suitable for a truly conformal irradiation. Carbon ions have the added advantage, with respect to protons, of the high density of ionization {{at the end of the}} range in matter. This property is very valuable for the control of tumours which are radioresistant to both X-rays and protons. After clarifying the general principles, a review is presented of the world hadron therapy centres which are running or are in the design and construction stage. (33 refs) ...|$|R

As well as housing the Hallé Orchestra, it was used for pop and rock concerts. A Wurlitzer organ from the Paramount Cinema in Manchester was installed over four years and first used in public in a BBC programme broadcast in September 1977.

50|$|Radiation Oncologists {{have been}} using proton therapy to treat cancer since the 1950s. Long {{recognized}} for their targeting capability, proton beams achieve greater precision than traditional X-rays, while exposing healthy tissue to less radiation. This allows physicians to deliver high doses of radiation even when tumors are <b>close</b> to sensitive <b>organs</b> and tissue. A proton therapy beam’s powerful energy is focused directly on a patient’s tumor. Once released, the energy stops - there is no exit dose and no additional radiation unlike X-ray beams and gamma knife rays.|$|R
