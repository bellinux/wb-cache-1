5|$|When the sinoatrial {{cells are}} resting, {{they have a}} {{negative}} charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive. This is called depolarisation and occurs spontaneously. Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium <b>channels</b> close and calcium ions then begin to enter the cell, shortly after which potassium begins to leave it. All the ions travel through ion <b>channels</b> in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium only start {{to move out of}} and into the cell once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called voltage-gated. Shortly after this, the calcium <b>channels</b> close and potassium <b>channels</b> open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to have a negative resting charge and is called repolarization. When the membrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium <b>channels</b> close and the process may begin again.|$|E
