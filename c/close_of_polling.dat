25|$|The runoff count took a week, {{handled by}} the Democratic State Central Committee (because this was a party primary). Johnson was finally {{announced}} the winner by 87 votes out of 988,295 cast. The Committee voted to certify Johnson's nomination {{by a majority of}} one (29–28), with the last vote cast on Johnson's behalf by Temple, Texas, publisher Frank W. Mayborn. There were many allegations of voter fraud; one writer alleges that Johnson's campaign manager, future Texas governor John B. Connally, was connected with 202 ballots in Precinct 13 in Jim Wells County where the names had curiously been listed in alphabetical order with the same pen and handwriting, just at the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling.</b> Some of these voters insisted that they had not voted that day. Robert Caro argued in his 1989 book that Johnson had thus stolen the election in Jim Wells County, and that 10,000 ballots were also rigged in Bexar County alone. Election judge Luis Salas said in 1977 that he had certified 202 fraudulent ballots for Johnson.|$|E

50|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the members}} of the 2nd Seanad Éireann, the upper house of the Oireachtas (legislature) of Ireland. These Senators were elected or {{appointed}} in March 1938 and served until the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>poll</b> for the 3rd Seanad in July 1938.|$|R
2500|$|Compulsory voting {{has also}} been {{promoted}} for its collective benefits. [...] It becomes difficult for coercion {{to be used to}} prevent disadvantaged people (the old, illiterate or disabled) to vote, and for obstacles to be put in the way of classes of individuals (ethnic/coloured; either registration requirements or placement of voting booths) as often happens under other voting systems. The compulsion requirement also needs to be kept in proportion: jury duty and compulsory military service are vastly more onerous citizen's compulsions [...] than attending a local voting booth once every few years. Perhaps the most compelling reason to use a system of compulsory voting is a simple matter of logistics, that is, to facilitate the smooth and orderly process of an election. Every year in countries that do not have compulsory voting election officials have to guess at the numbers of voters who might turn out – this often depends on the vagaries of the weather. Often voters are disenfranchied in those countries when voting officials err and not enough voting booths are provided. Long queues can result with voters being turned away at the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling</b> not having had their chance to exercise their democratic right to vote.|$|E
50|$|A precinct-count {{voting system}} is a voting system that {{tabulate}}s ballots at the polling place. Generally, systems that hand count the ballots will tabulate only after the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling.</b> Other voting systems typically tabulate the ballots as they are cast. In all systems, the vote totals are made public only after the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling.</b> For DREs and some paper-based systems these systems provide electronic storage of the vote count and may transmit results to a central location over public telecommunication networks. This system allows for voters to be notified of voting errors such as over voting and can prevent residual votes.|$|E

50|$|In 1948, an {{incident}} involving Lyndon B.

Johnson won the election against Coke Stevenson by 87 votes.|$|E
50|$|On {{election}} day, polling {{times were}} arranged to allow results from most provinces {{to be announced}} more or less simultaneously, {{with the exception of}} Atlantic Canada, whose results were known before the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling</b> in other provinces due to the British Columbia Supreme Court's decision in R. v. Bryan.|$|E
5000|$|Counting {{of votes}} began {{immediately}} after the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling,</b> but the EC {{said it would not}} be announcing results because of [...] "problems," [...] including the blocking of advance voting and the failure to hold voting in some constituencies.

50|$|At the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>poll,</b> {{the slot}} {{at the top}} of the ballot box is sealed by the {{presiding}} officer or poll clerk (the election and polling agents appointed by candidates can also apply their own seals to the boxes) before being transported 'directly and without delay' by the presiding officer to the central counting location.|$|R
50|$|Complaints were {{received}} by polling officials about the earlier than advertised <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling</b> booths in some electorates, the poor quality pencils supplied {{to fill in}} ballot papers (they apparently blunted easily, leaving many votes incomprehensible to officials) and the Senate ballot paper in New South Wales which listed 50 candidates, confusing many voters and leading to {{a significant number of}} informal votes.|$|R
50|$|There {{were a few}} {{reports of}} irregularities. Some polling {{stations}} ran out of ballot boxes, causing long delays in voting. To fit more ballots into the ballot boxes, some election workers forcefully stuffed ballots into the box using objects such as barbecue forks and metal rulers. Some stations also used random cardboard boxes without official seals. Some ballot boxes were opened before the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 16 April 2014, Pawar visited Masalwadi, {{a village}} in the Baramati {{constituency}} from which his cousin Supriya Sule was contesting the general election, and threatened the villagers {{that if they did}} not vote for Sule, he would punish them by cutting off water supply to the village. Pawar may have violated the election code of conduct as campaigning is not permitted within the 48 hours prior to the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Geoffrey Bing {{stated in}} Parliament that {{impersonation}} {{took place at}} one polling station on [...] "a really large scale", and that two election agents who arrived to investigate were attacked by a mob of two hundred people.

Carl Cullinane seeks to explore what might happen in between...|$|R
50|$|By 1955, the {{existence}} of television on election nights was having a significant effect. It prompted returning officers to hold their counts immediately after the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polls,</b> so that the results were declared during {{the early hours of}} the morning, rather than the following day. In 1955, for the first time, a majority of constituencies declared on the night (357 of the 630 constituencies).|$|R
5000|$|UKGameshows.com has polled {{its readers}} {{on the subject}} of the {{greatest}} British game shows and game show hosts on a four-year cycle.

50|$|In 1983, section 45 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 {{provided}} that:45 (a) Claims for enrolment... {{which are}} {{received by the}} Registrar after six {{o'clock in the afternoon}} of the day of the issue of the writ for an election shall not be registered until after the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling</b> at the election.This had the effect of closing the electoral roll on the day when an election was called, so that anyone who had not registered before it was called {{would not be able to}} vote.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the vote}} was no longer {{confined}} to the richest families in the county, voters quickly came to expect the candidates for whom they voted to meet their expenses in travelling to the poll and to entertain them when they got there. At the Wiltshire election of 1559, one of the candidates, George Penruddock, was Steward to William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke: at the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling,</b> Penruddock invited all the voters, {{as well as his}} opponents and the Sheriff, to a dinner at Wilton House, Lord Pembroke's seat.|$|E
50|$|A trial {{took place}} in Sopwell and Verulam wards under which voters could vote either by {{internet}}, phone, post or at the polling station using a touch screen system. The internet voting trial {{was funded by the}} Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions as part of an attempt to get more people involved in elections. As a result of the trial one of the wards set the fastest declaration time at only 4 minutes after the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling.</b> However turnout was actually down from 24.1% to 23.3% in Sopwell ward and down from 41.9% to 38.9% in Verulam ward compared to the last election in 2000.|$|E
50|$|During major {{election}} coverage, {{the program}} may center on political analysis and commentary, as the show's prime time airing generally {{coincides with the}} <b>closing</b> <b>of</b> <b>polls</b> in many states. Larry King would air generally {{near the end of}} each hour with various guests during election coverage while hosting a panel {{at the end of the}} night which is midnight eastern the usual time slot for the show's daily repeat outside of live election coverage.|$|R
50|$|Polling {{opened at}} 8 a.m., with both parties organising {{transport}} for their supporters. Rosettes in party colours were widely worn: blue for the Conservatives and red for the Liberals. The Liberals were fearful of personation and employed {{a large number}} of scrutineers at the eleven polling stations. Polling was relatively slow until lunch time, when large numbers of navvies and mill-operators voted. There was a heavy poll from 5 p.m. until the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polls</b> at 8 p.m.|$|R
5000|$|On polling {{day at the}} <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>poll</b> Unionist {{headquarters}} were [...] "confidently {{expecting that}} Sir Henry Hibbert's majority will exceed 2,000". Unsurprisingly, the Unionists held the seat. However, their majority fell by 5.6% to 1,967 {{as a result of}} a swing to the Liberals;The Liberal candidate John Jackson stated that he was content to have disappointed Bonar Law and to have reduced a Unionist majority in a by-election for the time since the general election.|$|R
50|$|A direct-recording {{electronic}} (DRE) {{voting machine}} records votes {{by means of}} a ballot display provided with mechanical or electro-optical components that can be activated by the voter (typically buttons or a touchscreen); that processes data with computer software; and that records voting data and ballot images in memory components. After the election it produces a tabulation of the voting data stored in a removable memory component and as a printed copy. The system may also provide a means for transmitting individual ballots or vote totals to a central location for consolidating and reporting results from precincts at the central location. These systems use a precinct count method that tabulates ballots at the polling place. They typically tabulate ballots as they are cast and print the results after the <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling.</b>|$|E
50|$|On {{election}} night 16 October 2004, four {{hours after the}} <b>close</b> <b>of</b> <b>polling,</b> with 78 per cent of the vote counted, Liberal leader, Brendan Smyth, conceded defeat to Labor. Smyth conceded that the incumbent Labor Government had been returned {{for a second term}} and appeared set to win the Territory's first ever majority mandate. Labor had obtained 47 per cent of the vote across the ACT, with the Liberals at 34.8 per cent and the Greens at 9.2 per cent. Swings were recorded towards Labor (+5.3 per cent), Liberal (+3.2 per cent) and the ACT Greens (+0.1 per cent). Support for the Democrats collapsed and they lost their one and only seat. Counting continued up until 27 October 2004, when all preferences were distributed, resulting in Labor winning nine seats, the Liberals winning seven seats, while the Greens won one seat. The ACT Electoral Commission determined and announced the election's final results on 29 October 2004. The result marked {{the first time in the}} history of ACT self-government that one party was able to win a majority in its own right.|$|E

5000|$|On polling day, Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry tweeted {{a picture}} of a house (in Strood) adorned with England flags with a white van parked outside, which drew accusations of liberal elitism {{including}} from her fellow Labour Party MP Simon Danczuk among others.
