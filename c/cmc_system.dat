These new social spaces help establish social networks and rely on technology to allow users to interact with a group of others. As such, their design and development revolves around two main areas: usability and sociability. As this paper will demonstrate, there is a constant struggle between these two fundamental disciplines which stand at the heart of <b>CMC</b> <b>systems.</b> The group’s interests and rationale can often conflict with those of the user resulting in tension which can be damaging and even destructive.

Discussing quality and access in distance education from theoretical constructs, Garrison [2] states that the `concern for quality in distance education has identified an emerging paradigm based upon two-way communication as a necessary and central component of an educational transaction' (p. 17). In other words, interactive two-way communication is the critical component in distance education.
