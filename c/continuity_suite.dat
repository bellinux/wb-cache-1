5000|$|In-vision {{continuity}} was re-introduced {{as part of}} Children's BBC/CBBC) on 9 September 1985. From then until 1994, {{this came}} from the main BBC1 <b>continuity</b> <b>suite</b> itself, referred to as [...] "the broom cupboard" [...] and introduced by various presenters including Andy Crane, Andi Peters and Phillip Schofield; Since then, it has come from larger, specialised studios. As of September 2011, presentation for both CBBC and CBeebies originates from the BBC's MediaCityUK studios in Salford Quays, following the BBC Children's department move from London.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{he moved to}} ATV. Fellow {{broadcaster}} Alex Trelinski recalled [...] "he brought some great laughs into his continuity slots. The highlight of the week was on a Friday night when ATV would screen a horror film after News at Ten under the umbrella title of [...] "Appointment with Fear". Everybody would have fun, with often the <b>continuity</b> <b>suite</b> lights being darkened, and Peter Tomlinson would appear clutching a teddy bear. I wouldn't bother with the film, but his intro was worth watching and would have me in stitches".|$|E
50|$|In Jersey, Channel's first {{headquarters}} were a purpose-built centre at {{the corner}} of Rouge Bouillon and Val Plaisant, housing one main 1,000 sq.ft. studio for all local productions and a <b>continuity</b> <b>suite.</b> As the company expanded, Channel moved into larger facilities in 1988 at La Pouquelaye, converted from the former offices of Rediffusion's Jersey operation. Initially, the La Pouquelaye centre housed two production studios (the smaller studio B was latterly converted into offices) and a continuity studio, later used exclusively for Puffin's Pla(i)ce. Channel moved to its current, smaller premises at Castle Quay in June 2015.|$|E
50|$|ITV and Channel 4 took {{advantage}} of C-Day to update their <b>continuity</b> <b>suites</b> to be widescreen capable, broadcasting their idents in widescreen.|$|R
50|$|Studios 3 & 4 - Studios {{designed}} for use as in-vision <b>continuity</b> <b>suites,</b> news studio and interviews. Originally used Studio 3, but much was transferred to Studio 4 later on. Studio 4 was closed in 1996, and productions transferred back to Studio 3. Located in original building.|$|R
25|$|From {{inception}} {{for over}} 20 years, Radio 1 broadcast from an adjacent pair of <b>continuity</b> <b>suites</b> (originally Con A and Con B) {{in the main}} control room of Broadcasting House. These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op). This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle. Due to needle time restrictions, much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings. The DJs were assisted {{by one or more}} technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts.|$|R
50|$|On 3 September 2007, the CSO {{studio was}} dropped in a {{relaunch}} which {{saw a small}} studio set built in TC12. As part of the relaunch, new logos, presenters and idents were introduced. The design of the new 'office' set {{has been compared to}} the original 'broom cupboard', though unlike the 'broom cupboard' the 'office' is not a functioning <b>continuity</b> <b>suite.</b> CBBC presentation originated from Studio HQ5 at MediaCityUK in Salford Quays {{for the first time on}} Monday 5 September 2011 as part of the relocation of the BBC's Children's department (incorporating both CBBC and CBeebies).|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to build a suite of software tools that use a unique combination of techniques to generate specific audio material. Emphasis will be put on the methods used to create the desired sounds, how to achieve sophisticated control over relevant parameters quickly and easily, and how to provide functionality that cannot be replicated with existing software. The driving force behind the creation of each piece of software is the type of sound created and how this can be used within my own compositions. The development of application will begin with a specific sound or compositional method in mind, which will be worked towards through a process of refining various audio and control processes. I have become increasingly interested in drone music and two of the three applications will be ideally suited to creating audio material for this genre. The final application stems from my interest in the cut up style compositions of Akufen and is designed to simplify the creation of samples in this style. An important part of {{the research}} is the development of the graphical user interfaces for each piece of software. I want to create not just Max/MSP patches, but standalone applications that I find enjoyable and easy to use. I feel {{it is important to have}} <b>continuity</b> throughout the <b>suite</b> and will demonstrate this by using a similar design aesthetic in each application. Through my research of other applications created in Max, I recognise that the design of the user interface has a large impact on whether I enjoy using the software. With this in mind I intend to organise the interfaces in a logical way, and to keep them as clear as possible. Another main research aim is using the computer to cut down the time it takes to achieve my compositional goals. Through actively using the applications as they are being developed, I will be able to identify areas that I can refine, which will save time when composing. One area I will investigate is the application of random number procedures and how they can be used to provide interesting variation of the sound within bounded parameters. Each of the final applications will demonstrate their role in my compositional process. I will use Max/MSP as the development environment as I have had extensive experience with it during my undergraduate degree, and also for independent projects. As a prototyping environment it has an advantage over traditional code based programming because any changes are instantly usable, giving the environment a ‘live’ feel. The diagrammatical nature of the patching window also lends itself to experimentation and quick changes, which are not as feasible in text based programming languages. When working towards a specific sound, this ease of experimentation is a vital characteristic of the software and will undoubtedly save time during the development process...|$|R
