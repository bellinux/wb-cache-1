Assays on latex collected in Belo Horizonte and Recife yielded LD 90 values similar to those obtained with the reference substance collected in Rio de Janeiro (Ilha do Governador), demonstrating geographic stability of the molluscicidal effect. The molluscicidal action of aqueous dilutions of the latex in natura, <b>centrifuged</b> (<b>precipitate)</b> and lyophilized, was stable for up to 124 days at room temperature (in natura) and for up to 736 days in a common refrigerator at 10 to 12 ºC (lyophilized product).

40|$|H-Canyon {{will begin}} {{dissolving}} High Aluminum - Low Uranium (High Al/Low U) Used Nuclear Fuel (UNF) following approval by DOE which is anticipated in CY 2011. High Al/Low U is an aluminum/enriched uranium UNF with small quantities of uranium relative to aluminum. The maximum enrichment level expected is 93 % {sup 235 }U. The High Al/Low U UNF will be dissolved in H-Canyon in a nitric acid/mercury/gadolinium solution. The resulting solution will be neutralized {{and transferred to}} Tank 39 H in the Tank Farm. To confirm that the solution generated could be poisoned with Gd, neutralized, and discarded to the Savannah River Site (SRS) high level waste (HLW) system without undue nuclear safety concerns the caustic precipitation of simulant solutions was examined. Experiments were performed with three simulant solutions representative of the H-Canyon estimated concentrations in the final solutions after dissolution. The maximum U, Gd, and Al concentration were selected for testing from the range of solution compositions provided. Simulants were prepared in three different nitric acid concentrations, ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5 M. The simulant solutions were neutralized to four different endpoints: (1) just before a solid phase was formed (pH 3. 5 - 4), (2) the point where a solid phase was obtained, (3) 0. 8 M free hydroxide, and (4) 1. 2 M free hydroxide, using 50 wt % sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The settling behavior of the neutralized solutions {{was found to be}} slower compared to previous studies, with settling continuing over a one week period. Due to the high concentration of Al in these solutions, precipitation of solids was observed immediately upon addition of NaOH. Precipitation continued as additional NaOH was added, reaching a point where the mixture becomes almost completely solid due to the large amount of precipitate. As additional NaOH was added, some of the precipitate began to redissolve, and the solutions neutralized to the final two endpoints mixed easily and had expected densities of typical neutralized waste. Based on particle size and scanning electron microscopy analyses, the neutralized solids were found to be homogeneous and less than 20 microns in size. The majority of solids were less than 4 microns in size. Compared to previous studies, a larger percentage of the Gd was found to precipitate in the partially neutralized solutions (at pH 3. 5 - 4). In addition the Gd:U mass ratio was found to be at least 1. 0 in all of the solids obtained after partial or full neutralization. The hydrogen to U (H:U) molar ratios for two accident scenarios were also determined. The first was for transient neutralization and agitator failure. Experimentally this scenario was determined by measuring the H:U ratio of the settled solids. The minimum H:U molar ratio for solids from fully neutralized solutions was 388 : 1. The second accident scenario is for the solids drying out in an unagitiated pump box. Experimentally, this scenario was determined by measuring the H:U molar ratio in centrifuged solids. The minimum H:U atom ratios for <b>centrifuged</b> <b>precipitated</b> solids was 250 : 1. It was determined previously that a 30 : 1 H:Pu atom ratio was sufficient for a 1 : 1 Gd:Pu mass ratio.

30|$|A {{concentrated}} 70  % aqueous acetone decoction {{was obtained}} from the dried sapwood of Q. crispula infected by Raffaelea quercivora. When the concentrated solution was sitting at room temperature, a precipitate was observed. After having been <b>centrifuged,</b> the <b>precipitate</b> (brownish-red colored, 5.25  g) and supernatant (khaki colored, 15.4  g) were separated. The precipitate was subjected to Sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography and preparative HPLC to yield (1). The chemical shifts and coupling constants of 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of (1) are shown in Table  1. Acid hydrolysis of (1) gave an ellagic acid and a gallic acid, indicating that it possesses these phenolic acids with ester binding and/or glycosidic linkage as shown in ellagitannins such as tellimagrandin II [8]. The negative ion mode of the LC-TOF/MS for (1) by ESI gave 2 main peaks at m/z 584.9888 and m/z 300.9526 with an intensity of 80 and 100  %, respectively. In our previous paper, ester bonds of gallic acid and hexahydroxy diphenoic acid (HHDP) to a sugar of tercheblin gave only molecular ions without any fragments using the conditions described in this paper for the negative ion mode of the LC-TOF/MS [9]. In addition, pentagalloylglucose gave 2 main peaks for the molecular ion and fragment ion corresponding to [M − galloyl]+ (data not shown). These results mean that an ester binding in hydrolyzable tannins is not cleaved, while a glycosidic linkage is easily cleaved by the ESI mode of the LC-TOF/MS. If the fragment ion m/z 300.9526 could be obtained by loosing 1  mol of ellagic acid from molecular ion m/z 584.9888, an ellagic acid should be connected at the C 1 position of the sugar moiety as a glycosidic linkage. Thus, a mole of gallic acid could be connected at another position of the sugar as an ester bond, which appears at m/z 300.9526. According to the mass number of the molecular ion and the fragment ion peaks, the sugar moiety of (1) is considered to be xylose.|$|R

IGF binding protein 1 (IGFBP 1) is {{a protein}} that regulates {{the actions of}} IGF-I by binding to IGF-I which alters it's ability to bind to the IGF-I receptor. Diet and exercise may influence this system. While IGFBP 1 levels increase with fasting or prolonged exercise, feeding will reverse this elevation. The intent {{of this study was}} to determine if an in vivo manipulation of IGFBP 1 affects in vitro glucose transport in the rat soleus. Sixteen male Spaque Dawley rats were fasted for 12 hours. Half of the animals were then allowed a two hour ad libitum refeeding period. Animals were anesthetized and had their soleus muscles removed. Muscles were then randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Treatments involved an incubation in either 4 or 8 mM glucose in either the presence or absence of IGF-I (75 ng x ml"'). Final incubation for all treatment groups included [3 H]- 3 -O-methylglucose (437 µCi x mM-) for the measurement of glucose transport. Following incubation, muscles were weighed, homogenized in 1 ml of 10 % trichloroacetic acid, and <b>centrifuged</b> to <b>precipitate</b> out protein. 100 µl of the supernatant was added to 3 ml of scintillation fluid and analyzed in a scintillation counter. Glucose transport was determined by 3 H activity. A statistical analysis of the various groups shows that there is no significant difference between fasted and refed animal for any specific treatment. However, when all the fasted and refed animals area grouped, glucose transport rate is significantly greater (p< 0. 05) in fasted (3. 59 ± 0. 44 µM x ml"' x hr) animals than in refed animals (2. 56 ± 0. 27 µM x ml"' x hr'). Additionally, muscles that were treated with IGF-I in 8 mM glucose demonstrated a greater rate of glucose transport (5. 12 ± 0. 68 µM x ml- 1 x hr') than all other treatments (2. 13 ± 0. 39 to 2. 90 ±. 33 µM x ml-' x hr'). This study showed that IGF-I is a stimulator of glucose transport in an 8 mM glucose media. Additionally, the results show that glucose transport is greater if the animals are fasted. The differences between fasted and refed animals demonstrated in this study supports the hypothesis that diet manipulated IGFBP 1 levels are able to alter the biological effects of IGF-I.

30|$|The {{content of}} total tannin was {{determined}} by protein precipitation/binding method using the method reported by Atlabachew et al. (2014) using egg albumin to precipitate tannins in the plant extracts. A portion of 0.3  mL the sample extract was properly diluted to 2  mL with distilled water and mixed with 2  mL of 5  mg/mL egg albumin in acetate buffer solution (0.1  M, pH, 4.6), which was previously prepared, and kept for 15  min, centrifuged at 2000  rpm for 20  min and supernatant was filtered with filter paper and used for analysis. Exactly 400 µL of the supernatant was taken and 1  mL of Folin–Denis reagent was added, followed by 1  mL of 7  % (w/v) sodium carbonate solution (Na 2 CO 3), and then filled with distilled water to 10  mL. The light blue colored solution was measured using UV/Vis spectrophotometer at 760  nm. For tannin determination, first total polyphenols in the tea extracts before protein precipitation was determined using Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (TPC 1). Then the same volume of the extract was treated with protein (egg albumin) and kept for some time. Then, after a set period of time, the solution was <b>centrifuged</b> and the <b>precipitated</b> was kept for the second, the supernatant (which is free from tannins) was taken and the concentration of non-tannin phenolic compounds was determined using the above procedure. Then, tannin concentration {{was determined by}} difference. Calibration curve was constructed using tannic acid in ethanol–water mixture; the result was expressed with tannic acid equivalent per dry weight of the sample.|$|R
40|$|Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst. (BM), a {{traditional}} Ayurvedic medicine, used for centuries as a memory enhancing, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, sedative and antiepileptic agent. BM extract have been extensively investigated by several authors for their neuropharmacological effects. In nuclear medicine, {{red blood cells}} (RBC) labeled with technetium- 99 m (99 mTc) have several clinical applications. However, data have demonstrated that synthetic or natural drugs could modify the labeling of RBC with 99 mTc. As Bacopa monnieri is extensively used in medicine, we evaluated its influence on the labeling of RBC and plasma proteins using technetium- 99 m (99 mTc). This labeling procedure depends on a reducing agent and usually stannous chloride is used. Blood was incubated with BM extracts. Stannous chloride solution and 99 mTc were added. Blood was centrifuged and plasma (P) and blood cells (BC) were isolated. Samples of P or BC were also <b>precipitated,</b> <b>centrifuged</b> and insoluble fraction (IF) and soluble fraction (SF) were separated. The percentage of radioactivity (%ATI) in BC, IF-BC and IF-P were calculated. The %ATI significantly decreased on BC from 95. 53 ± 0. 45 to 35. 41 ± 0. 44, on IF-P from 80. 20 ± 1. 16 to 7. 40 ± 0. 69 and on IF-BC from 73. 31 ± 1. 76 to 21. 26 ± 1. 40. The morphology study of RBC revealed important morphological alterations due to treatment with BM extracts. We suggest that the BM extract effect {{could be explained by}} an inhibition of the stannous and pertechnetate ions or oxidation of the stannous ion or by damages induced in the plasma membrane...|$|R
