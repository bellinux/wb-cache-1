500|$|In disclaiming U.S. culpability in January 2001, then-President <b>Clinton</b> <b>told</b> reporters, [...] "The {{evidence}} {{was not clear}} that there was responsibility for wrongdoing high enough {{in the chain of}} command in the Army to say that, in effect, the government was responsible." [...] American lawyers for the No Gun Ri survivors rejected that rationale, saying that whether 7th Cavalry troops acted under formal orders or not, [...] "the massacre of civilian refugees, mainly the elderly, women and children, was in and of itself a clear violation of international law for which the United States is liable under the doctrine of command responsibility and must pay compensation". Writing to the Army inspector general's office in May 2001, the lawyers also pointed out that numerous orders were issued at the war front to shoot civilians, and said that the U.S. military's self-investigation – [...] "allowing enforcement to be subject to the unbridled discretion of the alleged perpetrator" [...] – was an ultimate violation of victims' rights.|$|E

We wanted voters to be able to find, in one easy place, all of the various plans and policies that I’ve been talking about throughout this campaign.” Kaine emphasized that the book had a positive message about the country's future, unlike what he said was the pessimistic vision put forth by Trump's 2015 book Crippled America. The campaign chose the slogan and title [...] "Stronger Together" [...] from 85 possibilities; it was used on the campaign aircraft, campaign bus, and in a series of policy speeches.|$|E
2500|$|FBI Director James Comey {{identified}} 110 emails as containing {{information that}} was classified {{at the time it}} was sent, including 65 emails deemed [...] "Secret" [...] and 22 deemed [...] "Top Secret". None of these had classification markings. However, as noted in Clinton's non-disclosure agreement, unmarked classified information should be treated the same as marked classified information. An additional three email chains contained [...] "portion markings", simply a [...] "(C)" [...] indicating [...] "Confidential" [...] in front of one or more paragraphs. These were not included in Comey's list of 110 because the State Department failed to confirm they were classified at the time they were sent. <b>Clinton</b> <b>told</b> the FBI she did not know the meaning of [...] "(C)". Nearly 2,100 emails on the server were retroactively marked as classified by the State Department.|$|E

2500|$|The {{indication}} by Caroline Kennedy {{that she}} was possibly interested in being appointed drew the most media attention. [...] Her family legacy (including that her uncle Robert F. Kennedy had previously held the seat) and star power was balanced against her inexperience in politics and elections. [...] Her uncle Senator Ted Kennedy, in a battle with brain cancer, encouraged her to seek the position. [...] On December 15, Kennedy indicated {{that she was}} definitely seeking the appointment, making phone calls to Paterson and other prominent Democrats. [...] Kennedy and her uncle had backed Obama over Clinton at a crucial time in the long presidential nomination struggle, and some past Clinton supporters initially disparaged Kennedy's qualifications for the senate seat. [...] But soon <b>Clinton</b> <b>told</b> her supporters not {{to stand in the}} way of a Kennedy selection; Clinton said she herself would have no public comments on any of the possible choices.|$|E
2500|$|The Bush {{administration}} never officially {{commented on}} the film. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who is portrayed in the film, called the sibling rivalry portrayed in the film [...] "high-grade, unadulterated hooey" [...] and said that Stone's exploration of the family dynamic could have benefited from actual conversations with the Bush family. Slate magazine's Timothy Noah, however, noted that [...] "most [...] the film's more ludicrous details" [...] are actually directly taken from non-fiction sources, and argued that the film was too kind to Bush in omitting certain historically recorded dramatic events, most notably Bush's alleged mocking of murderer Karla Faye Tucker, a woman put to death during his tenure of the Texan governorship. However, the incident is disputed by Bush himself, and as such is also unconfirmed. In a March 2010 [...] "Screen Test" [...] interview with The New York Times Lynne Hirschberg, Josh Brolin claims Bush did in fact watch the film. [...] Brolin said Oliver Stone met with Bill Clinton in China and <b>Clinton</b> <b>told</b> Stone he'd lent his copy of W. to Bush.

It was on this occasion that Blumenthal was accused by the independent counsel of seeking to discredit the office of the counsel by passing stories to the media about Starr and his aides. The leadership of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives felt enough evidence existed in regard to the Paula Jones case and Lewinsky for impeachment proceedings to begin in December 1998.|$|R

2500|$|On September 23, 2010, United States Secretary of State Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>told</b> Japanese [...] Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara that Senkaku {{and nearby}} waters {{are covered by}} the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, which obligates the United States to defend Japanese {{territory}} from attacks by third-party countries, and maintained that USA {{does not have a}} position regarding the sovereignty of the islands. At a press conference held on the same day, United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said that in the event of military conflict over the Senkaku islands, [...] "Washington would honor its military commitment to intervene". A reporter posed the same question to clarify an earlier Kyodo report that [...] "US changed its position", similar statements were made at a US State Department Press Conference a month previously on August 16, 2010: [...] "The U.S. position on this issue is longstanding and has not changed. The United States does not take a position {{on the question of the}} ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands. We expect the claimants to resolve this issue through peaceful means among themselves. But Article 5 of the 1960 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security states that the treaty applies to the territories under the administration of Japan. There's no change. That (Kyodo) report is incorrect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the July 1999 {{murder of}} Army Pfc. Barry Winchell, {{apparently}} motivated by anti-gay bias, President Clinton issued {{an executive order}} modifying the Uniform Code of Military Justice to permit evidence of a hate crime to be admitted during the sentencing phase of a trial. In December, Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered a review of DADT {{to determine if the}} policy's anti-gay harassment component was being observed. When that review found anti-gay sentiments were widely expressed and tolerated in the military, the DOD adopted a new anti-harassment policy in July 2000, though its effectiveness was disputed. On December 7, 1999, Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>told</b> an audience of gay supporters that [...] "Gays and lesbians already serve with distinction in our nation's armed forces and should not face discrimination. Fitness to serve should be based on an individual's conduct, not their sexual orientation." [...] Later that month, retired Gen. Carl E. Mundy defended the implementation of DADT against what he called the [...] "politicization" [...] of the issue by both Clintons. He cited discharge statistics for the Marines for the past 5 years that showed 75% were based on [...] "voluntary admission of homosexuality" [...] and 49% occurred during the first 6 months of service, when new recruits were most likely to reevaluate their decision to enlist. He also argued against any change in the policy, writing in the New York Times: [...] "Conduct that is widely rejected by a majority of Americans can undermine the trust that is essential to creating and maintaining the sense of unity that is {{critical to the success of}} a military organization operating under the very different and difficult demands of combat." [...] The conviction of Winchell's murderer, according to the New York Times, [...] "galvanized opposition" [...] to DADT, an issue that had [...] "largely vanished from public debate". Opponents of the policy focused on punishing harassment in the military rather than the policy itself, which Sen. Chuck Hagel defended on December 25: [...] "The U.S. armed forces aren't some social experiment." ...|$|E

He didn't seem to have any doubt that we would succeed, but I knew that that was his religion working in him; I hadn't the same confidence; I hadn't any idea where to turn to raise all that bullion, and I said so. I think he was ashamed of me, privately, because of my weak faith. He told me to give myself no uneasiness, no concern; and said in a simple, confident, and unquestioning way, [...] "the Lord will provide."

[...] "I was a mediocre country lawyer", Riley <b>told</b> <b>Clinton.</b> [...] "This isn't my thing." [...] Clinton next considered his Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, a former Arizona governor. Clinton prepared to nominate Babbitt when two problems surfaced—a false published report about gambling debts in Las Vegas and opposition to Babbitt's nomination voiced by Sen. Orrin Hatch, who was the ranking Republican on the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. Hatch had <b>told</b> <b>Clinton</b> that Babbitt's strong pro-environmental views had enraged a group of Republican senators in the western United States who might take revenge either on Babbitt's nomination or on the candidate Clinton nominated to replace him in the Department of the Interior.
