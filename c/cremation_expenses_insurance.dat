40|$|The subject. Nowadays {{a variety}} of civil law studies {{actively}} discusses the issues of insurance regulation. However, legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> is unknown to Russian legal doctrine and practice. The research focuses on legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance.</b> The purpose of the article is to reveal a potential that legal and economic instruments have in comparison to other guarantees of unobstructed enjoyment of the rights and legitimate interests. The methodology. It is a comparative law approach that allows to describe the peculiarities of legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> in foreign countries, outline the criteria to match the existing models, determine their similarities and differences as well as benefits and drawbacks. Economic analysis of law is helpful to evaluate the convenience of a new tool for citizens and its influence {{on the level of}} their legal expenses. The results, scope of it’s application. As a result, the article argues that legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> improves the financial accessibility of qualified legal assistance and stimulates legal activity, since it does not impose any formal restrictions on the clients, the content of the contract or the sphere of its application. Meanwhile, the research formulates and characterizes some difficulties that may occur in the course of introduction of this institution to Russian law. Primarily, such obstacles include the low level of insurance culture, the need of significant amendments to legislation in force and the lack of professional expertise in this field. Despite different political and legal obstacles, it is necessary to create an effective model of legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> in Russia in order to improve Russian legal system and form the culture of getting legal services in time. Conclusions. The insurance mechanisms provide citizens with an opportunity to minimize their legal and financial risks connected to unforeseeable situations, which require covering costs of professional legal assistance. The authors conclude that legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> is able to become an additional guarantee to the right to qualified legal assistance in case of appropriate adaptation to current conditions of Russian legal life and legal mechanisms.  </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of varying {{defendant}} fault on the comparison of litigation outcomes under the contingent fee regime and the legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> regime. The criteria for regime comparison are: (i) expected plaintiff payoffs, (ii) plaintiff and defendant expenditures, (iii) total contest effort, (iv) incentives for delegation, and (v) justice. We find that the performance of both regimes is highly dependent on defendant fault and this serves to sharpen the analysis to current literature.

Many consumers could not distinguish between the legal cover of car insurance (protection against being sued for damages) and Motor Legal <b>Expenses</b> <b>Insurance</b> (pursuit of legal rights in recovering uninsured losses and cases of prosecution).

These can include employment disputes, litigation, disciplinary actions, human rights complaints and criminal charges.

40|$|Modern civil legal aid, has {{its roots}} in the post war United Kingdom, being a {{fundamental}} component of the welfare state, recognised as such by the political parties of the time. The provision of civil legal aid today is a different animal and does not share the same values as the 'old' scheme. This analysis will assess the evolution of civil legal aid, its success and failure, and consider the changes it has undergone and the forces behind those changes in dictating its current profile as a limited and franchised public services provision.;Legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance,</b> unlike civil legal aid, is a relative newcomer as a provider of access to civil justice. The scepticism that accompanied its arrival in this country, some 20 years ago, has dissipated. Insurers battled with the problems of adverse selection, European regulation and the public perception of their product, all of which have influenced market penetration. The position of legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> within the civil justice system has begun to strengthen and is now openly recognised and supported by the legal establishment. A key objective of this analysis is to consider the rise of the legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> market in the United Kingdom. This analysis seeks to assess the history of legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> and evaluate its current position as a viable addition, or possible alternative, to State funded civil legal aid.;Therefore, it becomes necessary for this study to consider the position of comparative European jurisdictions. In addition, the role and reaction of the legal practitioner situated amidst such significant and fundamental change is solicited and evaluated since they have, at once, fought change and yet accepted it in equal measure.;Finally, this analysis explores the future position of civil legal aid and legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance.</b> It considers the survival of the former, growth of the latter and the dynamics of the State and private sectors working together to mould a new model for the provision of access to civil justice in the United Kingdom...|$|R

40|$|The {{right of}} access to civil justice is a {{cornerstone}} of the Belgian legal order. At present time, however, financial barriers prevent about {{three quarters of the}} Belgian population from fully asserting their subjective rights. As traditionally, apart from legal aid, private funding is the dominant method of funding a civil claim in Belgium, alternative funding options in between private and public funding might hold some prospects for improving the access to civil ustice. Therefore this paper aims to provide an in-depth economic analysis of the effects of cost shifting, client-lawyer fee arrangements and legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> on the various dimensions of the access to civil justice. In summary, the main results from the analysis are that theoretically all three alternative funding methods may hold certain prospects for improving the accessibility of civil justice. But, as far as empirical data are available, cost shifting fits least the requirements for solving the policy issue addressed in this paper. However, the validity of this empirical observation is subject to certain limitations. Both contingency fees and legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> hold clear prospects for overcoming risk aversion and liquidity constraints. Also, relative to hourly fees, the incentive scheme inherent to contingency fees appears most appropriate to curb lawyer opportunism. The involvement of a legal expenses insurer may lead lawyers to behave less opportunistically too. Finally, within the current legal framework, insurers' control of costs and quality requires their direct or indirect involvement in the civil justice administration system. This may pose some challenging policy issues as the market for legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> further develops in the future. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the ways}} in which legal {{services}} are financed, and indeed shaped, is through private insurance arrangement. Two contrasting types of legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance</b> contracts (LEI) seem to dominate in Europe: before the event (BTE) and after the event (ATE) legal <b>expenses</b> <b>insurance.</b> Notwithstanding institutional differences between different legal systems, BTE and ATE insurance arrangements may be instrumental if government policy is geared towards strengthening a market-oriented system of financing access to justice for individuals and business. At the same time, emphasizing the role of a private industry as a keeper of the gates to justice raises issues of accountability and transparency, not readily reconcilable with demands of competition. Moreover, multiple actors (clients, lawyers, courts, insurers) are involved, causing behavioural dynamics which are not easily predicted or influenced. Against this background, this paper looks into BTE and ATE arrangements by analysing the particularities of BTE and ATE arrangements currently available in some European jurisdictions and by painting a picture of their respective markets and legal contexts. This allows for some reflection on the performance of BTE and ATE providers as both financiers and keepers. Two issues emerge from the analysis that are worthy of some further reflection. Firstly, there is the problematic long-term sustainability of some ATE products. Secondly, the challenges faced by policymakers that would like to nudge consumers into voluntarily taking out BTE LEI...|$|R
