After Beefcake threw David Sammartino out of the ring, Valiant lifted him up and slammed him to the <b>cement</b> <b>floor.</b> He then pushed Sammartino back into the ring before being attacked by Bruno. A short while later, all four men began fighting in the ring, and the match ended in a no-contest.|$|E
25|$|According to The Last Godfather, the men wrapped Perrino's corpse in {{a carpet}} {{and drove to}} a {{construction}} company, Commercial Brick, located at 98 Jewett Avenue in Port Richmond, Staten Island owned by Anthony Basile and buried him underneath the <b>cement</b> <b>floor</b> of the store. Several weeks later, one of his limbs {{was said to have}} risen up from the floor, making the mobsters dig a deeper grave. Years later, Anthony Basile was indicted on drug trafficking charges; Salvatore Vitale and Joseph Massino feared Anthony would become an informant and reveal Perrino's gravesite. His remains were removed from the <b>cement</b> <b>floor</b> and buried again.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of housing for people 2 ̆ 019 s well-being, {{there is little evidence}} on the causal impact of housing and housing improvement programs on health and welfare. In this paper, we help to fill this gap by investigating the impact of a large-scale effort by the Mexican Government to replace dirt <b>floors</b> with <b>cement</b> <b>floors</b> on child health and adult happiness. We find that replacing dirt <b>floors</b> with <b>cement</b> <b>floors</b> significantly improves the health of young children. Specifically, we find significant decreases in the incidence of parasitic infestations, diarrhea, and the prevalence of anemia, and an improvement in children 2 ̆ 019 s cognitive development. Additionally, we find that replacing dirt <b>floors</b> by <b>cement</b> <b>floors</b> significantly improves adult welfare, as measured by increased satisfaction with their housing and quality of life, as well as by lower scores on depression and perceived stress scales...|$|R
25|$|Even with {{an extra}} two months, the {{contractors}} still rushed to finish the building. The huge granite steps {{leading up to the}} main entrance were not in place (and would not be until 1940). Among the rooms being prepared at the last minute was the 1,000-seat circular auditorium {{at the rear of the}} second floor. Workers laid a <b>cement</b> <b>floor</b> for the auditorium (although this would later be replaced with marble). The marble wall material in the auditorium came from the Hilgartner Marble Co. of Baltimore, while the seating and woodwork came from the American Seating Co. of Grand Rapids. The fan-shaped ceiling and the frieze in the auditorium were designed by Louis Ludwig of Washington, D.C., while the installation of the ceiling and the frieze was done by the A.W. Lee Co. of Washington. Contractors were also busy installing sashes, windows, and ventilation grillwork throughout the building, and laying a <b>cement</b> <b>floor</b> in the memorial hall on the second floor. Bronze was used for the sashes, doors, doorjambs, and other exterior work where connection to the granite was required, and these items were installed by the William H. Jackson Co. of New York. The interior and exterior ironwork was supplied by the Alexandria Iron Works and the Washington Stair and Ornamental Iron Co. Other than the auditorium, no attempt was made to complete the first floor, the lodge rooms on the second floor, or any of the tower rooms in time for the dedication.|$|E

In the second period, Maple Leafs' Red Horner and Red Wings' Alex Motter fought on the ice and continued {{to do so in the}} penalty box with local police called in to break it up.

2500|$|In 2017, Buffalo Trace Distillery {{unveiled}} the much talked about O.F.C. Building, better {{known by its}} nickname “Bourbon Pompeii.” This building is a true historic gem in the chronicles of American bourbon distilling, with the original foundation wall built by Taylor in 1869, and then a second foundation Taylor built in 1873 when {{he set out to}} build the industry’s first “modern” distillery. The fermenting vats inside were found intact and date back to 1883. The foundation and the vats were covered with a <b>cement</b> <b>floor</b> when the building was decommissioned in 1958 and forgotten, until 2016 when Buffalo Trace began work on the O.F.C. Building to turn it into meeting and event space. That plan was altered upon discovery of this rare archeological treasure, although the upper levels of the building will still be used as event space as originally planned. One of Taylor’s fermenters will also be re-lined with copper as Taylor had originally designed it, for usage in the near future. These are unique finds, and may arguably be called the oldest, most intact distillery in existence in the United States; as intact remains of early buildings and equipment on most distilleries are completely removed during development and expansion.|$|E
