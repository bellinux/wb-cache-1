25|$|Monday <b>came,</b> <b>all</b> was well. Tuesday came, he not sick. Wednesday came, {{and still}} he was well; with which his impertinent wife did much twit {{him in his}} teeth. Thursday came, and dinner was ended, he very well: {{he went down to}} the water-side, and took a pair of oars to go to some {{buildings}} he was in hand with in Puddle-dock. Being {{in the middle of the}} Thames, he presently fell down, only saying, 'An impost, an impost,' and so died. A most sad storm of wind immediately following.|$|E
25|$|The Comanche {{have often}} been portrayed by historians in the U.S. as a simple and crude tribe lacking any {{coherent}} political organization or authority. Their success in creating an empire of the Plains, sophisticated diplomacy, and highly organized raids on Mexico contradicts that opinion. The numerous small Comanche bands came together in summer, usually on the Red River or one of its tributaries in Texas or Oklahoma to formulate plans and organize groups of raiders. Comanches <b>came</b> <b>all</b> {{the way from the}} Arkansas River to join the raids. Among the raiders were Kiowa, Kiowa-Apache, and other Indians plus a few renegade Mexicans and Anglos.|$|E

The Minto Sports Complex houses the university's two arena ice rinks, which seat 840 as well as Matt Anthony Field the home of Gee-Gees soccer and rugby, which seats 1,500. In 2013, the university opened Gee-Gees Field a new stadium for its varsity football team located at Lees Campus. The new stadium holds over 4,000 spectators and serves as the first on-campus home to the Gee-Gees football team in 120 years. Along with the stadium <b>came</b> <b>all</b> new facilities including: new team rooms, coaches’ offices, dedicated athletic therapy and video rooms.|$|E

25|$|In 1565, the Captain-major João Pereira {{brought the}} carrack {{to the port}} of Yokoseura with the {{intention}} of going to trade in Hirado. He was dissuaded from doing so by the Jesuits in Yokoseura, and was persuaded to head to another Ōmura anchorage at the bay of Fukuda, within present-day Nagasaki, accompanied by a small galleon belonging to Diogo de Meneses, the captain of Malacca. Deprived of his potential pickings, Matsura Takanobu sought to punish the Portuguese for switching ports and conspired with Sakai merchants who <b>came</b> <b>all</b> the way to Hirado for naught. Matsura promised to divide the booty with the Sakai merchants in return for the loan of eight to ten of their large junks, and attached up to sixty smaller Japanese boats to form a flotilla carrying several hundred samurai to sail to Fukuda. The Jesuit fathers in Hirado sent warnings to Pereira when they realized what Takanobu was doing, but Pereira dismissed the threat. He was hence surprised when he saw the Hirado flotilla approach from the horizon.|$|E
25|$|The Hearst news empire {{reached a}} revenue peak about 1928, but the {{economic}} {{collapse of the}} Great Depression in the United States and the vast over-extension of his empire cost him control of his holdings. It {{is unlikely that the}} newspapers ever paid their own way; mining, ranching and forestry provided whatever dividends the Hearst Corporation paid out. When the collapse <b>came,</b> <b>all</b> Hearst properties were hit hard, but none more so than the papers; Furthermore, his now-conservative politics, increasingly at odds with those of his readers, only worsened matters for the once great Hearst media chain. Having been refused the right to sell another round of bonds to unsuspecting investors, the shaky empire tottered. Unable to service its existing debts, Hearst Corporation faced a court-mandated reorganization in 1937. From that point, Hearst was reduced to being merely another employee, subject to the directives of an outside manager. Newspapers and other properties were liquidated, the film company shut down; there was even a well-publicized sale of art and antiquities. While World War II restored circulation and advertising revenues, his great days were over. The Hearst Corporation continues to this day as a large, privately held media conglomerate based in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of all the}} LH sedans, {{the first}} {{generation}} Concorde was most {{closely related to the}} Eagle Vision. The Concorde was given a more traditional image than the Vision. The two shared nearly all sheetmetal in common with the main differences limited to their grilles, rear fascias, body side moldings, and wheel choices. The Concorde featured a modern take on Chrysler's signature waterfall grille. It was split into six sections divided by body colored strips with the Chrysler Pentastar logo on the center strip. The Concorde's rear fascia was highlighted by a full-width and full-height lightbar between the taillights, giving the appearance that the taillights stretched across the entire trunk. In keeping with its upscale position, Concorde's body side moldings incorporated bright chrome (later golden colored) work not found on its Dodge or Eagle siblings. On Concordes with gray lower body paint color, the gray <b>came</b> <b>all</b> {{the way up to the}} chrome beltline; on Visions the gray lower body paint area was smaller and much more subtle. Wheel styles, which included available aluminum wheels with a Spiralcast design, were also unique to the Chrysler LH sedans (Concorde, LHS, New Yorker); Dodge and Eagle had their own different wheel styles.|$|E

500|$|Hornish again {{returned}} to Penske in 2006. The team changed manufacturers, joining Honda when Toyota and Chevrolet left the series after the 2005 season. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I figured I <b>came</b> <b>all</b> this way, I ought to give myself one more shot at it. I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E
500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if she could hear him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and began to think that it may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I <b>came</b> <b>all</b> the way from Varanasi to hear your songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, [...] "Stay here and sing for me. (…) Varanasi is not the only place where I live; I pervade the whole universe." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1978, Salvatore [...] "Ciaschiteddu" [...] Greco, {{the old and}} ailing {{former head}} of the Sicilian Mafia Commission, <b>came</b> <b>all</b> the way from Venezuela to try to {{restrain}} Calderone, Di Cristina, Gaetano Badalamenti and Salvatore Inzerillo from retaliating against the growing power of the Corleonesi.

Greco tried to convince them not to go ahead and offered Di Cristina to emigrate to Venezuela.|$|E

2500|$|The Sixers finally <b>came</b> <b>all</b> the {{way back}} in 1976–77, in large part due to a {{byproduct}} of the ABA–NBA merger. The ABA's last champions, the New York Nets, were facing having to pay almost $5 million to the Knicks for [...] "invading" [...] the New York area {{on top of the}} $3.2 million expansion fee for joining the NBA. When the Sixers offered to buy the contract of the Nets' franchise player, Julius Erving, for $3 million—roughly the cost of NBA membership—the Nets {{had little choice but to}} accept. A few months before that trade, Kosloff had sold the Sixers to local philanthropist Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr., grandson of George Dunton Widener and heir to the Widener fortune.|$|E
2500|$|Governor Winthrop {{served as}} both the primary {{prosecutor}} and judge at the trial. The other magistrates representing the prosecution were Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley, John Endecott, Richard Bellingham, Israel Stoughton, Roger Harlakenden, Increase Nowell, Simon Bradstreet, and John Humphrey. [...] There were eight ministers present for the proceedings, beginning with John Cotton and John Wilson from the church at Boston. [...] Hugh Peter <b>came</b> <b>all</b> the way from Salem, and Thomas Weld was there from Roxbury as one of Hutchinson's accusers.

2500|$|The HH600 {{was nearly}} {{identical}} to the previous #0900 of the New Haven internally and mechanically, but it was clad in new bodywork, with a straight-sided hood and cab sides that <b>came</b> <b>all</b> {{the way to the}} frame. [...] The HH600 was powered by a 6-cylinder McIntosh & Seymour 531 engine of , and was built from July 1932 through May 1939; in all, 78 HH600s were constructed. [...] The first-built units had sharp-edged front hood corners, but in 1934 ALCO employed industrial designer Otto Kuhler to clean up the appearance; he curved the corners and recessed the headlight, and all subsequent HH series units were of this style until another restyling in 1938 where the nose was further rounded. Late versions of this locomotive used the 6-cylinder 538 engine.|$|E
