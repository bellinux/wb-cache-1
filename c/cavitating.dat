25|$|The valvular {{event that}} causes such <b>cavitating</b> {{conditions}} to exist is the closing {{mechanics of the}} MHV. Several causes of cavitation relating to valve closure have been identified. Squeeze flow is cavitation that is said to occur as the occluder approaches the housing during closure and fluid is squeezed between the occluder and the valve housing causing a low pressure formation. Water hammer is cavitation caused by the sudden stop of the valve occluder as it contacts the valve housing. This sudden retardation of the fluid retrograde inertia is said to put the fluid under tension causing cavitation. Squeeze flow is said to form a cloud of bubbles at the circumferential lip of the occluder whereas water hammer {{is said to be}} seen as transient bubbles at the occlude housing.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Data {{showed that}} among 5 -year-old Chinese, 96. 7 % of <b>cavitated</b> primary teeth were left untreated. The study aimed {{to report on}} the course of <b>cavitated</b> primary teeth within the Chinese health-care system over a period of 3. 5 years. METHODS: Selection of high caries risk {{children}} for inclusion in a sealant comparison study was based on the presence of <b>cavitated</b> dentine lesions in their primary teeth. At the 6 -month sealant evaluation point many of these <b>cavitated</b> dentine lesions had not been treated. This necessitated monitoring these <b>cavitated</b> teeth 6 -monthly for those exfoliated, restored, with a cavity left open, having caused toothache (symptom) and having (or having had) an abscess or fistulae (symptom). Care-seeking instruction was given at every evaluation point. anova and t-test were used in analysing the data. RESULTS: A total of 1012 <b>cavitated</b> primary teeth in 305 children (7. 6 to 9. 3 years old), were followed for 3. 5 years. A total of 92. 9 % of <b>cavitated</b> primary teeth were left open, while 7. 1 % were restored at some stage during the observation period; 98. 5 % of restored teeth and 95. 5 % of <b>cavitated</b> teeth left open exfoliated and 93. 9 % of restored teeth and 81. 5 % of <b>cavitated</b> primary teeth left open exfoliated without any symptoms. Having (or having had) toothache was the symptom most frequently related to exfoliated restored teeth and to exfoliated <b>cavitated</b> teeth left open.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{risk factors}} for <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence and extent of <b>cavitated</b> caries among adolescents. Methods: Three hundred and three Iowa Fluoride Study (IFS) subjects met inclusion criteria for interval between dental examination and the responses from the IFS (ages 13. 5 to 17. 0) and the Block Kids Food Frequency (ages 13. 0 to 17. 0) questionnaires, respectively. The analyses focused on the outcome variables of net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence and net <b>cavitated</b> caries increment counts, respectively. The independent IFS questionnaire variables related to demographics, fluorides, oral hygiene, beverage intakes, dental visits, sealants and previous caries incidence variables, respectively, whereas, Block 2 ̆ 7 s questionnaire variables related to intakes of solid foods and beverages, respectively. Two sets of analyses, logistic and negative binomial regression analyses, were conducted to assess the associations between risk factors and net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence and increment counts from 13 to 17, respectively. Results: In multivariable logistic regression analyses, significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) negative associations were found between age 13 to 17 net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence and greater frequency of consumption of vegetables, greater brushing frequency and greater frequency of sugar-free beverage consumption. Additionally, significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) positive associations were found between age 13 to 17 net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence and both net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence from 9 to 13 and frequency of consumption of solid-foods in the combined category of presumed moderate cariogenicity. The significant interaction effect showed {{that the effect of}} the presence/ absence of sealants varied for girls vs. boys. In multivariable negative binomial analyses assessing the association between net <b>cavitated</b> caries increment count from 13 to 17 and risk factors, significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) positive associations were found with greater intake of foods predominant in starch, presence of sealants, greater baseline age, <b>cavitated</b> caries increment count from 9 to 13, and greater frequency of consumption of foods predominant in added sugar, respectively. Significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) negative associations were found between net <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence and greater frequency of consumption of foods predominant in fiber and natural sugar and greater daily fluoride intake from water. However, daily fluoride intake from water was not statistically significant with the significant interaction effect included between baseline age and net <b>cavitated</b> caries increment count from 9 to 13 (dichotomized as Y/N). Conclusion: Presence of sealants, frequency of consumption of vegetables and previous <b>cavitated</b> caries incidence from 9 to 13 were associated with outcomes of incidence and extent of <b>cavitated</b> caries observed among IFS adolescents.

40|$|PurposeThis study {{examined}} {{risk factors for}} children having new <b>cavitated</b> caries between 5 and 9 years old. MethodsSubjects were Iowa Fluoride Study cohort children(mostly Caucasian and of relatively high socioeconomic status) with both primary and mixed dentition caries exams and at least 2 diet diaries recorded between 5 and 8 years old (N= 198). Using surface-specific transitions, combined counts of new <b>cavitated</b> caries (d 2 - 3 f and/or D 2 - 3 F) were determined from 4 primary second molars, 8 permanent incisors, and 4 permanent molars. Food and beverage intake frequencies were abstracted. Other factors were assessed using periodic questionnaires. Logistic regression identified predictors of new <b>cavitated</b> caries. ResultsThirty-seven percent had new <b>cavitated</b> caries. The mean new <b>cavitated</b> caries count for all children was 1. 17 surfaces (212. 28 SD). In multivariable logistic regression, the following were significantly associated (P<. 10) with having new <b>cavitated</b> caries: noncavitated caries experience at 5 years old (odds ratio [OR]= 2. 67, P=. 03); <b>cavitated</b> caries experience at 5 years old (OR= 3. 39, P=. 004); greater processed starch at snack frequency (OR= 3. 87, P=. 07); being older (OR= 1. 68, P=. 04); and less frequent tooth-brushing (P=. 001). ConclusionResults suggested that increased tooth-brushing frequency and reduced consumption of processed starches as snacks may reduce caries incidence in younger school-aged children.

40|$|The International Caries Consensus Collaboration {{undertook}} a consensus process and here presents clinical recommendations for carious tissue removal and managing <b>cavitated</b> carious lesions, including restoration, based on texture of demineralized dentine. Dentists should manage the disease dental caries and control activity of existing <b>cavitated</b> lesions to preserve hard tissues and retain teeth long-term. Entering the restorative cycle {{should be avoided}} as far as possible. Controlling the disease in <b>cavitated</b> carious lesions should be attempted using methods which are aimed at biofilm removal or control first. Only when <b>cavitated</b> carious lesions either are noncleansable or {{can no longer be}} sealed are restorative interventions indicated. When a restoration is indicated, the priorities are as follows: preserving healthy and remineralizable tissue, achieving a restorative seal, maintaining pulpal health, and maximizing restoration success. Carious tissue is removed purely to create conditions for long-lasting restorations. Bacterially contaminated or demineralized tissues close to the pulp {{do not need to be}} removed. In deeper lesions in teeth with sensible (vital) pulps, preserving pulpal health should be prioritized, while in shallow or moderately deep lesions, restoration longevity becomes more important. For teeth with shallow or moderately deep <b>cavitated</b> lesions, carious tissue removal is performed according toselective removal to firm dentine. In deep <b>cavitated</b> lesions in primary or permanent teeth,selective removal to soft dentineshould be performed, although in permanent teeth,stepwise removalis an option. The evidence and, therefore, these recommendations support less invasive carious lesion management, delaying entry to, and slowing down, the restorative cycle by preserving tooth tissue and retaining teeth long-term. status: publishe...|$|R

METHODS: Data were collected by a mailed survey from {{a random sample of}} dentists from each State/Territory in Australia in 2003 - 2004. Dentists provided service data on patients treated on a typical clinical day for patients attending with a diagnosis of dental caries. RESULTS: Restorative rates were higher for insured patients, radiograph rates were higher for emergency visits, prophylaxis and topical fluoride rates were higher for non-emergency visits and at capital city locations with topical fluoride also higher for patients from higher socio-economic status areas, endodontic rates were higher for emergency visits and at non-capital city locations, while extraction rates were higher for males, uninsured patients and for emergency visits. Poisson regression models compared the rates of services from different service areas for initial and <b>cavitated</b> carious lesions with gross carious lesions, controlling for patient demographics, visit type, location and socio-economic status. Restorative services were provided at higher rates (P< 0. 05) for <b>cavitated</b> carious lesions (RR= 2. 38), radiographs were provided at lower rates for both initial (RR= 0. 28) and <b>cavitated</b> carious lesions (RR= 0. 31), both prophylaxis and topical fluoride services were provided at higher rates for initial carious lesions (RR= 2. 33 and 3. 00, respectively), endodontic services were provided at lower rates for both initial (RR= 0. 03) and <b>cavitated</b> carious lesions (RR= 0. 07), and extractions were provided at lower rates for both initial (RR= 0. 23) and <b>cavitated</b> carious lesions (RR= 0. 16) compared to the reference category of gross caries. CONCLUSION: Service patterns varied by level of carious lesion severity with initial carious lesions managed by more preventive services, <b>cavitated</b> carious lesions with more restorative services, gross carious lesions with more radiographic, endodontic and extraction services. However, initial carious lesions tend to be managed with restorative rather than preventive service, suggesting scope for increased management by minimum intervention approaches. David S.
