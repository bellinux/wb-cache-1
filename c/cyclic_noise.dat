40|$|The authors {{developed}} a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) scheme for classifying focal liver lesions (FLLs) as liver metastasis, hemangioma, and three histologic differentiation types of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), {{by use of}} microflow imaging (MFI) of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. One hundred and three FLLs obtained from 97 cases {{used in this study}} consisted of 26 metastases (15 hyper- and 11 hypovascularity types), 16 hemangiomas (five hyper- and 11 hypovascularity types) and 61 HCCs: 24 well differentiated (w-HCC), 28 moderately differentiated(m-HCC), and nine poorly differentiated (p-HCC). Pathologies of all cases were determined based on biopsy or surgical specimens. Locations and contours of FLLs on contrast-enhanced images were determined manually by an experienced physician. MFI was obtained with contrast-enhanced low-mechanical-index (MI) pulse subtraction imaging at a fixed plane which included a distinctive cross section of the FLL. In MFI, the inflow high signals in the plane, which were due to the vascular patterns and the contrast agent, were accumulated following flash scanning with a high-MI ultrasound exposure. In the initial step of our computerized scheme, a series of the MFI images was extracted from the original cine clip (AVI format). We applied a smoothing filter and time-sequential running average techniques in order to reduce signal noise on the single MFI image and <b>cyclic</b> <b>noise</b> on the sequential MFI images, respectively. A kidney, vessels, and a liver parenchyma region were segmented automatically by use of the last image of a series of MFI images. The authors estimated time-intensity curves for an FLL by use of a series of the temporally averaged MFI images in order to determine temporal features such as estimated replenishment times at early and delayed phases, flow rates, and peak times. In addition, they extracted morphologic and gray-level image features which were determined based on the physicians’ knowledge of the diagnosis of the FLL, such as the size of lesion, vascular patterns, and the presence of hypoechoic regions. They employed a cascade of six independent artificial neural networks (ANNs) by use of extracted temporal and image features for classifying five types of liver diseases. A total of 16 temporal and image features, which were selected from 43 initially extracted features, were used for six different ANNs for making decisions at each decision in the cascade. The ANNs were trained and tested with a leave-one-lesion-out test method. The classification accuracies for the 103 FLLs were 88. 5 % for metastasis, 93. 8 % for hemangioma, and 86. 9 % for all HCCs. In addition, the classification accuracies for histologic differentiation types of HCCs were 79. 2 % for w-HCC, 50. 0 % for m-HCC, and 77. 8 % for p-HCC. The CAD scheme for classifying FLLs by use of the MFI on contrast-enhanced ultrasonography has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy in the histologic diagnosis of HCCs and the other liver diseases...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated that humans are able to implicitly encode and retain repeating patterns in meaningless auditory noise. Our study aimed at testing the robustness of long-term implicit recognition memory for these learned patterns. Participants performed a cyclic/non-cyclic discrimination task, during which they were presented with either 1 -s <b>cyclic</b> <b>noises</b> (CNs) (the two halves of the noise were identical) or 1 -s plain random noises (Ns). Among CNs and Ns presented once, target CNs were implicitly presented multiple times within a block, and implicit recognition of these target CNs was tested 4 weeks later using a similar cyclic/non-cyclic discrimination task. Furthermore, robustness of implicit recognition memory was tested by presenting participants with looped (shifting the origin) and scrambled (chopping sounds into 10 - and 20 -ms bits before shuffling) versions of the target CNs. We found that participants had robust implicit recognition memory for learned noise patterns after 4 weeks, right from the first presentation. Additionally, this memory was remarkably resistant to acoustic transformations, such as looping and scrambling of the sounds. Finally, implicit recognition of sounds was dependent on participant’s discrimination performance during learning. Our findings suggest that meaningless temporal features as short as 10 ms can be implicitly stored in long-term auditory memory. Moreover, successful encoding and storage of such fine features may vary between participants, possibly depending on individual attention and auditory discrimination abilities...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{cognitive}} radio systems, cyclostationary feature detection {{plays an important}} role in spectrum sensing, especially in low SNR cases. To configure the detection threshold under a certain noise level and a pre-set miss detection probability Pf, it’s important to derive the theoretical distribution of the observation variable. In this paper, <b>noise</b> distribution in <b>cyclic</b> frequency domain has been studied and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution is found to be a precise match. Maximum likelihood estimation is applied to estimate the parameters of GEV. Monte Carlo simulation has been carried out to show that the simulated ROC curve is coincided with the theoretical ROC curve, which proves the efficiency of the theoretical distribution model.

40|$|AbstractCymA, {{the outer}} {{membrane}} {{component of the}} cyclodextrin (CD) uptake and metabolism system of Klebsiella oxytoca, was reconstituted into lipid bilayer membranes. The channel properties of this unusual porin were studied in detail. The binding of CDs to the channel resulted in its complete block for ion transport. This result allowed the detailed investigation of carbohydrate binding, and the stability constants for the binding of cyclic and linear carbohydrates to the binding site inside the channel were calculated from titration experiments of the membrane conductance with the carbohydrates. Highest stability constant was observed for α-cyclodextrin (α-CD; K= 32, 000 1 /M) followed by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD; K= 1970 1 /M) and γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD; K= 310 1 /M). Linear maltooligosaccharides bound also to CymA but with much smaller stability constants as compared to <b>cyclic</b> ones. The <b>noise</b> of the current through CymA in multi- and single-channel experiments was investigated using fast Fourier transformation. The current through the open channels had a rather high spectral density, which was a Lorentzian function of the frequency up to 2000 Hz. Upon addition of cyclic dextrins to the aqueous phase the spectral density decreased in a dose-dependent manner, which {{made it impossible to}} evaluate the binding kinetics. Experiments with single CymA-channels demonstrated the channel is highly asymmetric concerning channel flickers and current noise...|$|R
40|$|Mn and V oxyanions were {{successfully}} incorporated into sulphuric acid anodized oxide layer developed on AA 2024 as a sealing process. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) {{was employed to}} understand the deposition mechanism of Mn and V oxyanions during sealing process. Different electrochemical techniques such as <b>cyclic</b> polarization, electrochemical <b>noise</b> (EN), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were employed to study the corrosion performance of the developed coatings. CV results showed the presence of cathodic peak potential (Epc) at 0. 36 V and - 0. 32 V for permanganate and vanadate solutions respectively. Both peaks indicated the multi electron transfer electrochemical reduction of permanganates and vanadates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies carried out on the pore filled oxide layers also indicated the presence of + 4 oxidation states of both Mn and V. Results obtained from cyclic polarization technique showed the initiation of pitting occurred at - 0. 6 V on both plain (PO) and Mn-V oxyanion sealed oxide layers (MnVO). Whereas passivation potential (Ep) observed at - 0. 35 V only {{in the case of}} sealed oxide layer. No change in the current density (60 µAcm- 2) value was observed when the potential scan was increased to 2000 mV with respect to OCP. This could be due to the effective barrier layer property of the sealed oxide layer. No sign of visual pits were observed on cyclic polarization tested sealed oxide layer surface. EN results showed the higher noise resistance (Rn) value for MnVO (1. 7 MΩ. cm 2) compared to PO (0. 24 MΩ. cm 2) after 1 h immersion in 3. 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} and analytical modal analysis {{is used to}} establish a system modelling methodology in rotating structures, which subsequently can help in design and development of rotating machinery. The purpose of the study is to develop and use modal testing and vibration analysis which would involve obtaining the mathematical model of the system from the test data and subsequently obtaining the unbalanced parameters. The research work includes the application of modal testing method in rotor rig to investigate different modal parameters and detect the behaviour and performance of rotating machinery. This method would be capable of solving many of the related rotating machine problems, such as in turbine and compressor. Unbalance is one of the problems which exist in rotating machinery. Balancing is usually an expensive and laborious procedure and a balancing system would be beneficial for rotor dynamic systems and power generation applications. Excess vibration can cause <b>noise,</b> <b>cyclic</b> stress and wear in machinery. It is important to identify all the critical speeds within the range of operation and analyse the damping effect, mass unbalance and other phenomena in rotating machinery and their effects in their safe operation. These will be investigated in this study. There are several phenomena associated with rotating machinery such as centrifugal and gyroscopic forces which would create complexity in the mathematical procedures in modal analysis {{that they need to be}} addressed and interpreted appropriately before they could be used in modal testing of rotating machinery. The experimental technique used in this thesis to obtain the modal and dynamic response properties of structures. This technique has been applied to rotating structures, however the full implementation of modal testing in rotating structures and the implications are not fully understood. and are therefore in need of further investigations. In this study the Frequency Response Function (FRF) data obtained from the specific experimental results are curve-fitted by theoretical data regenerated from overall statistical analysis of measured data. Different excitation methods are used in experiment (hammer and shaker). For hammer test, transient signal is produced. While for shaker test, different vibration signals are produced (Sine, Random and Burst Random). In shaker test, a special frame was designed and used around a plain bearing and the accelerometers were attached to the outer surface of the bearing to measure the response of the lateral motion on several points of the shaft. The excitation force with help of push' rod was generated and applied to the shaft. This method can help to solve the problem in the attachment of shaker and force transducers to the rotor system. The analysis of vibration suppression with different locations and configurations of the unbalanced masses and effect of the adding of balance masses to suppress the vibration amplitude has been studied properly. The experimental results were used for verification of Finite Element (FE) models, since it has good capability for eigen analysis and also good graphical facility. 3 -D models result in large number of nodes and elements. This project demonstrates how to extract a plane 2 -D model from the 3 -D model that can be used with fewer nodes and elements with no loss in accuracy of the results. Transient orbit analysis in the literature indicates that the bearing stiffness and damping affects the vibration amplitude. In this project the study of the effects on the bearing reaction forces and cyclic. bending stress will be investigated. It is envisaged that the approach is not limited to the condition diagnosis and predictive failure but could help the designers to have better understanding of rotor performance at the system design stage. The experimental data are used to characterise the dynamic behaviour of the system and introduce to the correction unbalance to suppress the excess vibration. The experimental data are also used to generate the FE models and subsequently calculate the dynamic reaction forces in the bearings and the cyclic bending stress...|$|R
