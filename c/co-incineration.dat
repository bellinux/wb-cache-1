40|$|Highlights • Four {{approaches}} recovering {{energy from}} sewage sludge are assessed from 3 E perspective. • Influence of sludge organic content on the assessment result is concluded. • Energy efficiency and economic performance decrease sharply due to low sludge VS/TS. • <b>Co-incineration</b> in cement kilns {{is the best}} choice for low-organic-content sludge. Abstract Anaerobic digestion (AD), specific incineration (INC), <b>co-incineration</b> in coal-fired power plants (CINP) and <b>co-incineration</b> in cement kilns (CINC) are the four common approaches recovering energy from sludge in South China, where low-organic-content sludge is an important issue influencing the performance of the four approaches. In this study, the four approaches are assessed from the aspects of environmental impacts, energy efficiency and economic performance (3 E), and the influence of sludge organic content on the results is particularly paid attention to.

40|$|Essent {{operates}} a coal-fired power plant, called AC- 9, in Geertruidenberg. A gasifier connected to AC- 9 thermally treats waste wood through gasification. The waste wood Essent used is demolition and construction wood, the so-called B-wood. The gas produced through gasification is {{fed into the}} connected AC- 9 where it is used as fuel. However, after the BVA’s (Besluit Verbranden Afvalstoffen) entry into force, Essent had to stop the gasification of waste wood and the subsequent use of the resulting gas as fuel. The BVA is the Dutch implementing measure of the Waste Incineration Directive (Directive 2000 / 76 /EC, WID). According to the BVA, any power plant co-incinerating products of thermal treatment of waste {{is regarded as a}} <b>co-incineration</b> plant irrespective {{of the quality of the}} product. In the case of a power plant connected to a gasifier, the BVA treats the whole plant as a <b>co-incineration</b> plant. This raises the question of whether the plant of Essent, which is treated as a <b>co-incineration</b> plant by the BVA, is regarded as a <b>co-incineration</b> plant by the WID as well. To answer the question, first, the report dealt with the highly complicated issue of what constitutes waste. Second, it studied how the WID defines incineration and <b>co-incineration</b> plant. Third, it analysed the consistency of the BVA with the WID and the EC Treaty. Fourth, to find out whether the purified producer gas from the gasifier can be characterized as a ‘clean’ secondary fuel on which the BEES (Besluiten emissie-eisen stookinstallaties A en B) should be applicable, the properties of the gas were examined and compared with the properties of clean biomass. The report also investigated how the emissions per generated MJ looked like if the power plant is fired on only coal and on a combination of coal and producer gas. Finally, the criteria distilled from the case law of the European Court of Justice were applied to the producer gas of Essent. ...|$|E

40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} (MSW) {{management}} {{is becoming increasingly}} popular {{around the world as}} a means of accommodating the increasing amounts of waste that the growing global population generates. China currently produces more MSW than any other country. As such, this area of the world is facing challenges on an unprecedented scale. MSW management in China is highly dependent on landfilling, and the development of sanitary landfills is currently a top priority for the Chinese government. Hangzhou {{is one of the most}} developed cities in China. In fact, in 2013, the amount of incinerated MSW in Hangzhou represented 56 % of total MSW. MSW incineration is primarily performed via a process of <b>co-incineration</b> with coal because MSW has a low heating value. This paper employs a environmental impact assessment by LCA program to determine whether refuse-derived fuel (RDF) production and incineration can have a more positive impact on the environment than the <b>co-incineration</b> of MSW with coal in Hangzhou, China. According to the results, RDF production and incineration could improve Hangzhou’s MSW management global warming potential from - 33 % to 0 %, the acidification potential from - 90 % to 34 %, and the eutrophication potential from - 1 200 % to 350 % in comparison to the <b>co-incineration</b> of MSW with coal. The treatment of organic reject material from RDF production has a significant effect on the results; as such, it should be utilized in energy production rather than landfilled.

40|$|Carbonization is a newly {{developed}} process that converts sewage sludge to biocoal, {{a type of}} solid biomass that can partially substitute for coal during power generation. This study presents {{an assessment of the}} environmental effects of various sewage sludge treatment processes, including carbonization, direct landfills, <b>co-incineration</b> with municipal solid waste, and mono-incineration in Taiwan. This assessment was conducted using the life cycle assessment software SimaPro 7. 2 and the IMPACT 2002 + model. Results show that carbonization is the best approach for sewage sludge treatment, followed in descending order by <b>co-incineration</b> with municipal solid waste, direct landfills, and mono-incineration. The carbonization process has noticeable positive effects in the environmental impact categories of terrestrial ecotoxicity, aquatic ecotoxicity, land occupation, ionizing radiation, aquatic eutrophication, non-renewable energy, and mineral extraction. For the emission quantity of greenhouse gases, landfilling has the greatest impact (296. 9 kg CO 2 eq. /t sludge), followed by mono-incineration (232. 2 kg CO 2 eq. /t sludge) and carbonization (146. 1 kg CO 2 eq. /t sludge). <b>Co-incineration</b> with municipal solid waste has the benefit of reducing green house gas emission (– 15. 4 kg CO 2 eq. /t sludge). In the aspect of energy recovery, sewerage sludge that has been pretreated by thickening, digestion, and dewatering still retains a high moisture content, and thus requires a significant amount of energy use when used as a substitute solid fuel.

40|$|Owners of stables {{and owners}} of zoos have {{difficulty}} finding an economically sustainable deposition of their produced manure. More {{than two million}} tons of horse manure are produced in urban environments in Sweden every year. If the manure cannot be used as fertilizer on farm land it is classified as a waste fraction and should be handled according to current regulations. The manure is a valuable waste fraction that contains both energy and nutrients. If the manure cannot be spread on farm land more applications need to be identified, where the energy and nutrients in the manure can be used. The focus {{in this study is}} to investigate possible applications for the usage of horse and zoo manure within Borås municipality where, among other things, a waste water treatment plant and a combined heat and power plant are available. Horse and zoo manure have been investigated in the following applications: co-digestion with sewage sludge at a waste water treatment plant (lab experiments), co-digestion with food waste (theoretical), <b>co-incineration</b> with waste (full scale) and <b>co-incineration</b> with biomass (theoretical). Potential quantity of manure and economical and legal aspects have been studied as well. There is no compilation of the number of horses in the country which makes it hard to estimate the true quantity of manure. The quantity of manure from the zoos are somewhat easier to estimate since the zoo owners are fewer and have knowledge of their manure production. The co-digestions experiments in this study showed that addition of horse manure to digestion can be of interest in many ways, among other things it can give a more stable biogas production and a possible decrease in the Cd/P-ratio in the end product. Horse manure turned out to have a faster degradation rate compared to zoo manure, however the degradation rate was lower than that of sewage sludge. Zoo manure gave a relatively low biogas production compared to horse manure at thermophilic conditions. The <b>co-incineration</b> trial with waste and manure gave no negative effect with regard to emissions and operation. However, the amount of manure added to the incineration trial was low. The theoretical studies regarding the <b>co-incineration</b> with biomass, showed two potential alternatives that need to be investigated further. Interesting aspects to look further upon, based on this study, are for example:• Laws and regulations in the EU regarding manure. • Co-digestion of manure and sewage sludge in a larger scale. • Laws and regulations and costs regarding incineration of manure with biomass...|$|E

The major part of the dry matter content of this sludge consists of nontoxic organic compounds, in general a combination of primary sludge and secondary (microbiological) sludge. The sludge also contains a substantial amount of inorganic material and a small amount of toxic components. There are many sludge-management options in which production of energy (heat, electricity, or biofuel) {{is one of the key}} treatment steps. The most important options are anaerobic digestion, co-digestion, incineration in combination with energy recovery, <b>co-incineration</b> in coal-fired power plants, <b>co-incineration</b> in combination with organic waste focused on energy recovery, use as an energy source {{in the production of}} cement or building materials, pyrolysis, gasification, supercritical (wet) oxidation, hydrolysis at high temperature, production of hydrogen, acetone, butanol, or ethanol, and direct generation of electrical energy by means of specific micro-organisms. Incineration and <b>co-incineration</b> with energy recovery and use of sewage sludge in the production of Portland cement are applied on a large scale. In these processes, the toxic organics are destructed and the heavy metals are immobilized in the ash or cement. The energy efficiency of these processes strongly depends upon the dewatering and drying step. It is expected that these applications will strongly increase in the future. Supercritical wet oxidation is a promising innovative technology but is still in the development stage. With the exception of biogas production, the other biological methods to produce energy are still in the initial research phase. Production of biogas from sewage sludge is already applied worldwide on small, medium, and large scales.

40|$|Automotive {{shredder}} residue (ASR) is a heterogeneous waste stream with varying particle size and elemental composition. Owing to its complexity and hazardous characteristics, landfilling of ASR {{is still a}} common practice. Nevertheless, incineration with energy recovery of certain ASR fractions (Waste-to-Energy, WtE) emerges as an interesting alternative. In a full scale experiment, a waste mix of 25 % heavy ASR, 25 % refuse derived fuel (RDF), and 50 % waste water treatment (WWT) sludge was incinerated in the SLECO fluidized bed combustor (FBC) at the Indaver site in Antwerp, Belgium. Input and output streams were sampled and analyzed to make an inventory {{of the most important}} pollutants and toxics. The inventory was further used to determine the environmental impact. Results are compared to those of two other scenarios: incineration of the usual waste feed (70 % RDF and 30 % WWT sludge) and <b>co-incineration</b> of 39 % ASR with 61 % WWT sludge. It can be concluded that <b>co-incineration</b> of heavy ASR in an existing FBC is a valid and clean technology to increase current reuse and recovery rates. In the considered FBC, 27 % of the energetic value of ASR can be recovered, while all emissions remain well below regulatory limits and only 12. 6 % of the heavy ASR needs to be landfilled.

The present contribution gives an overview of the history of GHG emission regulation in Austria and identifies the progress made towards the realization of the national climate strategy to attain the GHG emission targets. The contribution uses Austria {{as an example of the}} way in which proper waste management can help to reduce GHG emissions. The GHG inventories show that everything must be done to minimize the carbon input due to waste deposition at landfill sites. The incineration of waste is particularly helpful in reducing GHG emissions. The waste-to-energy by incineration plants and recovery of energy yield an ecologically proper treatment of waste using state-of-the-art techniques of a very high standard. The potential for GHG reduction of conventional waste treatment technologies has been estimated by the authors. A growing number of waste incinerators and intensified <b>co-incineration</b> of waste in Austrian industry will both help to reduce national GHG emissions substantially. By increasing the number and capacity of plants for thermal treatment of waste the contribution of proper waste management to the national target for reduction of GHG emissions will be in the range of 8 to 14 %.

Municipal sewage sludge, taken from the Wastewater Treatment Plant in Tychowo and waste bicycle tires ware used in the examinations. In addition, results were compared with the results of coincineration of analysed sewage sludge mixed with hard coal as classic fuel. The initial stage of the study was a technical analysis of materials used in the examinations. Results of the analysis of exhaust gas fluxes, resulting from the <b>co-incineration</b> of examined waste and sewage sludge were presented and evaluated in the next part of paper. Following parameters were determined: cSO 2 – concentration of sulfur oxide (IV), cNOx –concentration of nitrogen oxides. Variable independent parameters determined during studies of mixtures incineration were: mass fraction of sludge in the fuel mixture, temperature in the combustion zone of the furnace and the excess air coefficient. Analysis of energetic properties and emissions of pollutants, under tested conditions of incineration of those mixtures, allowed determining the maximum share of sewage sludge in the fuel mixture and impact of variability of independent parameters of the incineration process on the quality of this process. Final analysis of energetic properties of mixtures and results of examinations on incineration conditions of those mixtures proved, that maximum mass fraction of sewage sludge should not exceed 10 %. Increase of incineration temperature significantly decreases quality of thermal processing of examined sewage sludge, increasing emissions of sulfur oxide (IV) and, to a greater extent, of nitrogen oxides NOx.

A two-phase CFD simulation of the flow and temperature field inside the tertiary air duct assesses the possibility of PCDD/F formation. It is demonstrated that fine atomization and sufficiently long tertiary air ducts virtually diminish the possibility of homogeneous PCDD/F formation.

40|$|Dioxins and furans, PCDD/Fs, {{are highly}} toxic {{substances}} formed in post combustion zones in furnaces. PCDD/F emissions are regulated by a waste incineration directive which relates also to <b>co-incineration</b> plants. Several observations of dioxin and furan enhancements in wet scrub- bers {{have been reported}} previously. This {{is thought to be}} due to the so-called "memory effect" which occurs when dioxins and furans absorb into plastic material in scrubbers and desorb when ambient circumstances alter significantly. At the <b>co-incineration</b> plant involved, dioxins and furans are controlled with a wet scrubber, the tower packing of which is made of plastic in which activated carbon particles are dispersed. This should avoid the memory effect and act as a dioxin and furan sink since dioxins and furans are absorbed irreversibly into the packing ma- terial. In this case, the tower packing in the scrubber is covered with a white layer that {{has been found to be}} mainly aluminium. The aim of this thesis was to determine the aluminium balance and the dioxin and furan behaviour in the scrubber and, thus, the impacts that the foul- ing has on dioxin and furan removal. The source of aluminium, reasons for fouling and further actions to minimize its impacts on dioxin and furan removal were also to be discovered. Measurements in various media around the scrubber and in fuels were made and a profile analysis of PCDD/F and mass balance calculations were carried out. PCDD/F content de- creased in the scrubber. The reduced PCDD/F was not discharged into scrubbing water. The removal mechanism seems to work in spite of the fouling, at least with low PCDD/F loads. Most of the PCDD/F in excess water originates from the Kymijoki River which is used as feeding water in the scrubber. Fouling turned out to consist mainly of aluminium hydroxides. Sludge combusted in the furnace was found to be a significant source of aluminium. Ways to minimize the fouling would be adjustment of pH to a proper lever, installation of a mechanical filter to catch the loose material from the scrubbing water and affecting the aluminium content of the sludge...|$|E

40|$|The {{substitution}} of combustion fuels in cement plants is increasing throughout many countries, and its individual performance is constantly assessed against strict regulatory standards. For cement plants within Australia, normal operations remain to use petroleum coal as the dominate energy source at the precalciner, avoiding {{the opportunity to}} reduce carbon-based resources and pollutant emissions (such as carbon dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, persistent organic pollutants) whilst providing the necessary energy needs through resource recovery. This paper presents stack emission monitoring of health-critical dl-PCB (dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl) congeners during the {{substitution of}} alternative fuels at ten Australian cement plants, and to distinguish statistical similarities between other key pollutants (such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD-F) and hydrogen halogens) and amongst the fuels used. Sampling of plant emissions was performed during normal operations (as baseline trials) and with the varied substitution rates of waste oil, solvents, chipped wood, refuge waste, carbon dust, shredded tyres and black sand (as experimental trials). The extraction of field and analytical data during these trials allowed for determining the total and individual unit mass of dl-PCB and PCDD-F isomers, standardised to 10 % O 2 and to World Health Organization (2005) toxicity equivalence (TEQ) values. The findings showed waste <b>co-incineration</b> during cement operations does reduce health-critical congeners of dioxins and dl-PCBs whilst providing the necessary energy and calcination needs. Experimental trials showed all dl-PCBs and PCB TEQ are below the internationally regulated Stockholm Convention article of 10 pg TEQ/Nm 3. In several cases, an increased rate of substituted fuel also identified a consistent reduction to baseline dl-PCBs. The distribution of toxic isomers (TCDD-F and PeCDD-F) were shown to be predominate during waste oil, wood chips, and solvent trials. Whereas the use of TDFs consistently showed a lower toxicity contribution.

In the first, the cutting oil emulsion is injected directly into the rotary kiln while the second scenario involves injection of the cutting oil emulsion in the tertiary air stream and thus directly into the precalciner. A detailed kinetic PSR modelling study is performed for combustion conditions relevant both to cement kiln and precalciner operating conditions. It is demonstrated that, although NOx emissions from the precalciner are generally substantially lower than those from the cement kiln, emulsion injection in the latter appears to be favourable and can lead up to 50 % reductions in NO levels. However, injection of cutting oil emulsion with relatively high nitrogen content in the precalciner may lead, under lean conditions, to increases in the emitted NO levels. The effect of cutting oil emulsion on CO and VOC emissions both under cement kiln and precalciner conditions is also quantified. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The EEEN forum has the {{objective}} {{to advance the}} evaluation of environmental policies. As resources become ever more scarce, policy needs well-integrated decisions that take into account side effects on all domains. Environmental economy has {{an important role to}} play in policy evaluation. Rather than focusing on single technologies or specific environmental effects, analytical models have a heliÂ­copter view on the full welfare impact. Through a focus on efficiency, environmental economics offers a methodology to balance environmental benefits and private investÂ­ment costs of policies. As waste and energy policies are managed by different administrative bodies, instruments are not inteÂ­grated. This presentation analyses, based on an analytical model, the side effects of taxation and subsidies in both domains. The theoretical approach is illustrated with the question whether high calorific waste should be treated in industrial installations to substitute primary fuel (<b>co-incineration)</b> or in conventional waste incinerators. Different energy and waste policy instruments interact in this issue. A second empirical illustration discusses the reasons and effects of integrating waste incinÂ­erators in the EU carbon emissions trading system. In both illustrations, taxes and subsidies have a direct impact on company behaviour and environmental impacts. - See more at: [URL] publishe...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the source}} of air {{pollutants}} is emission from local coal-fired boiler-houses and domestic heating boilers. The consequence of incineration of municipal waste is the introduction of additional pollutants into the atmosphere, including fly ash. The aim of this work was to evaluate the particle size distribution of fly ash emitted by coal combustion and <b>co-incineration</b> of coal with municipal waste in a domestic 18 kW central heating boiler equipped with an automatic fuel feeder. Mixtures of bituminous coal with different types of solid waste (5, 10 and 15 % of mass fraction) were used. Solid waste types consisted of: printed, colored PE caps, fragmented cable trunking, fragmented car gaskets and shredded tires from trucks. During the incineration of a given mixture of municipal waste with bituminous coal, the velocity of exhaust gas was specified, the concentration and mass flow of fly ash were determined together with the physico-chemical parameters of the exhaust gas, the samples of emitted fly ash were taken as the test material. Particle size analysis of fly ash was performed using laser particle sizer Fritch Analysette 22. The PM 10 share from all fly ashes from incineration of mixtures was about 100 %. Differences were noted between PM 2. 5 and PM 1...|$|E
40|$|<b>Co-incineration</b> of wastes started {{more than}} 20 years ago. In the last 10 years, {{the use of}} {{alternative}} fuels in the cement industry is continuously increasing. The use of solid wastes in cement kilns {{is one of the}} best technologies for a complete and safe destruction of these wastes, due to the fact that there is a simultaneous benefit of destroying wastes and getting the energy. However, particulate matters (PM) and gaseous chemicals emitted from a source into the environment could be directly transmitted to humans through air inhalation. Therefore, for accurate health risk estimation, the emission of pollutants must be determined. In this work, the analysis of the emission of different pollutants when replacing partially the fuel type used in a cement kiln is done. PM, PM 10, heavy metals and inorganic pollutants are analyzed. The methods used for sampling and analysis are the standard methods suggested by the EU regulations for stack analysis. Experimental results have shown the encouraging results: in particular clinker characteristics were unmodified, and stack emissions (NOx, SO 2 and CO mainly) were in the case of tires, slightly incremented but remaining almost always below the law imposed limits, and in some cases were even decreased...|$|E
40|$|The {{major part}} of the dry matter content of sewage sludge {{consists}} of nontoxic organic compounds, in general a combination of primary sludge and secondary microbiological sludge. The sludge also contains a substantive amount of inorganic material and a small amount of toxic components. There are many sludge-management options in which production of energy {{is one of the key}} treatment steps. The most important options are anaerobic digestion, co-digestion, incineration in combination with energy recovery and <b>co-incineration</b> in coal-fired power plants. The goal of our applied research is to verify, if the sludge from waste water treatment plants may be used as a biomass energy source in respect of the EU legislation, which would comply with emission limits or the proposal of energy process optimizing the preparation of coal/sludge mixture for combustion in the existing fluid bed boilers in the Czech Republic. The paper discusses the questions of thermal usage of mechanically drained stabilized sewage sludge from the waste water treatment plants in the boiler with circulated fluid layer. The paper describes methods of thermal analysis of coal, sewage sludge and its mixtures, mud transport to the circulating fluidised bed boiler, effects on efficiency, operational reliability of the combustion equipment, emissions and solid combustion residues...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the main {{results of the}} analysis and characterization of bricks manufactured with a clay and ashes mixture in the following proportions: 100 : 0, 99 : 1, 95 : 5, 90 : 10, 80 : 20 and 60 : 40 and calcined at a temperaturer anging from 50 to 1100 °C. The ashes {{used for this study}} were obtained from the bottom and the outlet gases of a Hoffmann-type brick furnace in Tabio, Cundinamarca, Colombia. When the typical coal consumption was substituted in part with incineration of municipal solid wastes (<b>Co-incineration).</b> The clay and ashes bricks were physical and chemical characterized with the following tests: XRaydiffraction (XRD), Fluorescent X-Ray (FXR), Infra RedSpectroscopy (IRS), Thermogravimetry (TG), Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy(AAS), Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) and Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) lixiviation tests that were performed according to the EPA 1311 method for the determination of heavy metals. Porosimetry, Cold Absorption, Breaking Load and Strength tests were also carried out to determinate the quality of the bricks. The strength and the breaking load slightly increases with the addition of ashes up to the 90 : 10 proportion and decreases in the higher ones, whereas the water absorption increases in all the mixtures. This study show that the finished product, manufactured with clay and ashes comply with all the quality standards required in Colombia...|$|E
