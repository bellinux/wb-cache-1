The nonlinear behavior of these plots is consistent with the onset of bridging. The onset of delocalization in the 2 -aryl- 2 -norbornyl <b>cation</b> as a result of electron withdrawing groups on the phenyl ring gives enhanced positive values for the isotope shifts at C 2 for deuterium substitution at Cg and reduced positive values for deuterium substitution at Cj.

Smaller <b>cations</b> form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metal <b>cations</b> do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal <b>cations</b> are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E

In the absence of steric hindrance, smaller group 2 <b>cations</b> tend to form stronger complexes, but when large polydentate macrocycles are involved the trend is reversed.|$|E

5|$|Holliday {{junctions}} {{may exist}} {{in a variety of}} conformational isomers with different patterns of coaxial stacking between the four double-helical arms. Coaxial stacking is the tendency of nucleic acid blunt ends to bind to each other, by interactions between the exposed bases. There are three possible stacking conformers: an unstacked form and two stacked forms. The unstacked form dominates in the absence of divalent <b>cations</b> such as Mg2+, because of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged backbones of the strands. In the presence of at least about 0.1 mM Mg2+, the electrostatic repulsion is counteracted and the stacked structures predominate. As of 2000, it was not known with certainty whether the electrostatic shielding was the result of site-specific binding of <b>cations</b> to the junction, or the presence of a diffuse collection of the ions in solution.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, {{like the}} alkali metals, has one valence {{electron}} and reacts easily with the halogens, but the similarities end {{there because of}} the small size of a bare proton H+ compared to the alkali metal <b>cations.</b> Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration.
