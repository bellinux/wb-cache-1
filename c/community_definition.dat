The communities are color-coded and the overlap between them is emphasized in red. The definition above is also local: if a certain sub-graph fulfills the criteria to {{be considered as a}} community, then it will remain a community independent of what happens {{to another part of the}} network far away. In contrast, when searching for the communities by optimizing with respect to a global quantity, a change far away in the network can reshape the communities in the unperturbed regions as well. Furthermore, it has been shown that global methods can suffer from a resolution limit problem, where the size of the smallest community that can be extracted is dependent on the system size. A local <b>community</b> <b>definition</b> such as here circumvents this problem automatically.|$|E

40|$|Community {{detection}} in networks {{refers to}} the process of seeking strongly internally connected groups of nodes which are weakly externally connected. In this work, we introduce and study a <b>community</b> <b>definition</b> based on internal edge density. Beginning with the simple concept that edge density equals number of edges divided by maximal number of edges, we apply this definition to a variety of node and community arrangements to show that our definition yields sensible results. Our <b>community</b> <b>definition</b> is equivalent to that of the Absolute Potts Model community detection method (Phys. Rev. E 81, 046114 (2010)), and the performance of that method validates the usefulness of our definition across a wide variety of network types. We discuss how this definition can be extended to weighted, and multigraphs, and how the definition is capable of handling overlapping communities and local algorithms. We further validate our definition against the recently proposed Affiliation Graph Model (arXiv: 1205. 6228 [cs. SI]) and show that we can precisely solve these benchmarks. More than proposing an end-all <b>community</b> <b>definition,</b> we explain how studying the detailed properties of community definitions is important in order to validate that definitions do not have negative analytic properties. We urge that community definitions be separated from community detection algorithms and propose that community definitions be further evaluated by criteria such as these.

In recent years, great efforts have been devoted to this problem in term of evaluating the resulting community structure. Our previous work has shown that in addition to the resolution limit of Q, both Q and D suffer from a more serious limitation, termed as extra weak community phenomenon, i. e. some derived communities do not satisfy even the weak <b>community</b> <b>definition.</b> In this paper, we provide a constrained optimization model to overcome extra weak community phenomenon. With an improved simulated annealing algorithm, we solve the constrained optimization model for both Q and D, and then use our new method in several practical community detection problems. The experimental results show that the new method can not only partition large networks into communities properly but also ensure that all resulting communities at least satisfy the weak <b>community</b> <b>definition.</b> In addition, we find that constrained optimization of Q finds fewer but large communities, while constrained optimization of D takes the network apart more detailed...|$|E

40|$|Complex {{networks}} {{constitute the}} backbones of many complex {{systems such as}} social networks. Detecting the community structure in a complex network is both a challenging and a computationally expensive task. In this paper, we present the HAMUHI-CODE, a novel fast heuristic algorithm for multi-scale hierarchical community detection inspired on an agglomerative hierarchical clustering technique. We define a new structural similarity of vertices based on the classical cosine similarity by removing some vertices {{in order to increase}} the probability of identifying inter-cluster edges. Then we use the proposed structural similarity in a new agglomerative hierarchical algorithm that does not merge only clusters with maximal similarity as in the classical approach, but merges any cluster that does not meet a parameterized <b>community</b> <b>definition</b> with its most similar adjacent cluster. The algorithm computes all the similar clusters at the same time is checking if each cluster meets the parameterized <b>community</b> <b>definition.</b> It is done in linear time complexity {{in terms of the number}} of cluster in the iteration. Since a complex network is a sparse graph, our approach HAMUHI-CODE has a super-linear time complexity with respect to the size of the input in the worst-case scenario (if the clusters merge in pairs), making it suitable to be applied on large-scale complex networks. To test the properties and the efficiency of our algorithm we have conducted extensive experiments on real world and synthetic benchmark networks by comparing it to several baseline state-of-the-art algorithms.

40|$|Finding {{communities}} {{is an important}} task for the discovery of underlying structures in social networks. While existing approaches give interesting results, they typically neglect the fact that communities may overlap, with some hub nodes participating in multiple communities. Similarly, most methods cannot deal with outliers, which are nodes that belong to no germane communities. The definition of community is still vague and the criterion to locate hubs or outliers vary. Existing approaches usually require guidance in this regard, specified as input parameters, e. g., the number of communities in the network, without much intuition. Here we present a general <b>community</b> <b>definition</b> {{and a list of}} requirements for a community mining metric. We review advantages and disadvantages of existing metrics and propose our new metric to quantify the relation between nodes in a social network. We then use the new metric to build a visual data mining system, which first helps the user to achieve appropriate parameter selection by observing initial data visualizations, then detects overlapping community structure from the network while also excluding outliers. Experiment results verify the scalability and accuracy of our approach on real data networks and show its advantages over existing methods that also consider overlaps. An empirical evaluation of our metric demonstrates superior performance over previous measures...|$|E

40|$|As {{a network}} evolves over time, {{multiple}} operators modify its configuration, without fully considering what {{has previously been}} done. Similar policies are defined more than once, and policies that become obsolete after a transition are left in the configuration. As a result, the network configuration becomes complicated and disorganized, escalating maintenance costs and operator faults. We present a method called NetPiler, which groups common policies by discovering a set of shared features and which uses the groupings for the configuration instead of using each individual policy. Such an approach removes redundancies and simplifies the configuration while preserving the intended behavior of the configuration. We apply NetPiler to the routing policy configurations from four different networks, and reduce more than 50 % of BGP communities and the related commands. In addition, we show that the reduced <b>community</b> <b>definitions</b> are sufficient to satisfy changes as the network evolves over nearly two years. 1...|$|R
