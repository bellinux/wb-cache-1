Cluster-to-cluster {{variations in the}} stellar initial mass function (IMF) have been suggested as an explanation. We discuss {{the implications of the}} observed degree of mass segregation in our sample clusters for the shape of the initial mass function. Our results are based on Hubble Space Telescope/WFPC 2 observations of six rich star clusters in the LMC, selected to include three pairs of clusters of similar age, metallicity and distance from the LMC centre, and exhibiting a large spread in <b>core</b> <b>radii</b> between the clusters in each pair. All clusters show clear evidence of mass segregation: (i) their luminosity function slopes steepen with increasing cluster radius, and (ii) the brighter stars are characterized by smaller <b>core</b> <b>radii.</b> For all sample clusters, both the slope of the luminosity function in the cluster centres and the degree of mass segregation are similar to each other, within observational errors of a few tenths of power-law slope fits to the data. This implies that their initial mass functions must have been very similar, down to ~ 0. 8 – 1. 0 Mʘ. We therefore rule out variations in the IMF of the individual sample clusters as the main driver of the increasing spread of cluster <b>core</b> <b>radii</b> with cluster age...|$|R

40|$|A {{model for}} {{positron}} binding to polar molecules {{is considered by}} combining the dipole potential outside the molecule with a strongly repulsive core of a given radius. Using existing experimental data on binding energies leads to unphysically small <b>core</b> <b>radii</b> {{for all of the}} molecules studied. This suggests that electron-positron correlations neglected in the simple model play a large role in determining the binding energy. We account for these by including polarization potential via perturbation theory and non-perturbatively. The perturbative model makes reliable predictions of binding energies for a range of polar organic molecules and hydrogen cyanide. The model also agrees with the linear dependence of the binding energies on the polarizability inferred from the experimental data [Danielson et al 2009 J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 42 235203]. The effective <b>core</b> <b>radii,</b> however, remain unphysically small for most molecules.

The galaxy sample includes 28 galaxies, 11 of which are confirmed members of the Virgo and Fornax clusters. In the 11 confirmed members, we detect 237 cluster candidates and determine their V magnitudes, V-I colors and <b>core</b> <b>radii.</b> After statistical – 2 – subtraction of background galaxies and foreground stars, most of the cluster candidates have V-I colors of- 0. 2 and 1. 4, V magnitudes lying between 20 and 25 th magnitude and <b>core</b> <b>radii</b> between 0 and 6 pc. Using Hα observations, we find that 26 % of the blue cluster candidates are most likely HII regions. The rest of the cluster candidates are most likely massive (> 10 4 M⊙) young and old clusters. A comparison between the red cluster candidates in our sample and the Milky Way globular clusters shows that they have similar luminosity distributions, but that the red cluster candidates typically have larger <b>core</b> <b>radii.</b> Assuming that the red cluster candidates are in fact globular clusters, we derive specific frequencies (SN) ranging from ∼ 0 - 9 for the galaxies.

40|$|We re-analyze {{constraints}} on the cosmological constant that {{can be obtained by}} examining the statistics of strong gravitational lensing of distant quasars by intervening galaxies, focusing on uncertainties in galaxy models (including velocity dispersion, luminosity functions, <b>core</b> <b>radii</b> and magnification bias effects) and on the parameters of the galaxy distribution and luminosity functions. In the process we derive new results on magnification biasing for galaxy lenses with non-zero <b>core</b> <b>radii,</b> and on how to infer the proper velocity dispersions appropriate for use in lensing statistics. We argue that the existing data do not disfavor a large cosmological constant. In fact, for a set of reasonable parameter choices, using the results of 5 optical quasar lensing surveys we find that a maximum likelihood analysis favors a value of in the range ≈ 0. 25 - 0. 55 in a flat universe. An open cosmology is not favored by the same statistical analysis.

By employing the largest sample of eMSTO LMC clusters so far used, we show that cluster <b>core</b> <b>radii,</b> masses, and dynamical state are not related to the genesis of eMSTOs. Indeed, clusters in our sample have <b>core</b> <b>radii,</b> masses and age-relaxation time ratios in the range ≈ 2 [...] 6 pc, 3. 35 - 5. 50 (log(M_cls/M_) and 0. 2 - 8. 0, respectively.

Furthermore, we confirm from a larger cluster sample recent results including young eMSTO LMC clusters, that the FWHM at the MSTOs correlates most strongly with cluster age, suggesting that a stellar evolutionary effect is the underlying cause.
