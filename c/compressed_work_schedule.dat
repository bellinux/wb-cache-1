The low female participation in labour workforce has motivated this study to be conducted. It aimed to provide insight to the employers on female employees special needs and their readiness to embrace flexible {{working arrangements}} if the resources were made available to them. “Readiness” to embrace flexible working arrangement was not previously studied in the flexible working arrangements field, hence a considerable amount of {{attention has been paid to}} construct the theoretical framework. An instrument is developed based on a critical review of Person-Environment (PE) fit theory that is able to explain the readiness of female employees depending on the situation surroundings them. Thus, this study postulates into three microsystems that are family (family responsibility, perceived benefits), work (career advancement, company policy), and community (supportive workplace) in PE fit theory that creates demands and resources (readiness on flexible working arrangements). The integrated approach has explained how the independent variables family responsibility, perceived benefits, career advancement, company policy impact on the readiness on flexible working arrangements and the mediating role of supportive workplace. The results shown that hypothesised relationships were partially supported, i. e family responsibility and perceived benefits was positively related to readiness to embrace flexible working arrangements. Besides, supportive workplace mediated the relationship between perceived benefits and company policy in relation to readiness to embrace flexible working arrangements. These findings have also demonstrated that women with different experience have different demands in flexible working arrangements. Findings have shown that 60 percent of the respondents were ready to embrace flexible working arrangements except for part time work options. Besides, this study has found that respondents with no children favored in <b>compressed</b> <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> as the statistical result recorded at p< 0. 05. The output of this study would be able to benefit policy makers, organizations and practitioners to establish flexible working arrangements in Malaysia.

40|$|Purpose: The {{following}} {{study examines}} employee satisfaction with an employer-imposed compressed workweek (“CWW”) schedule within a U. S. municipality (“City”). Design/methodology/approach: The study utilized an employee survey (N = 779) to test {{factors related to}} employee satisfaction with the CWW, a four-day, 10 -hours/day workweek (“ 4 / 10 schedule”). Findings: Employee satisfaction with the schedule is influenced by previous 4 / 10 pilot experience, <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> preference, and happiness with the 4 / 10 schedule’s implementation. Additionally, sick leave figures and survey results regarding informal substitute <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> suggest worker fatigue may limit the overall organizational value of the 4 / 10 schedule. Research limitations/implications: The study was opportunistic in nature and therefore constrained by the City’s HR Department concerns for survey length and respondent anonymity. This meant an inability to collect demographic data or to utilize validated scales. Practical implications: Analysis suggests that the potential work-life benefits of flexible <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> may not apply equally to employer-imposed vs. employee-chosen <b>compressed</b> <b>work</b> <b>schedules.</b> Further, CWWs engender greater fatigue despite employee satisfaction, an issue managers should consider when weighing schedule costs and benefits.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} of {{the effects}} of distribution of rest days in 12 hour shift systems. Although several studies have examined the effects of <b>compressing</b> <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> by comparing 8 and 12 hour shift systems, there is little published research examining the various forms of 12 hour shift system. METHODS: An abridged version of the standard shiftwork index which included retrospective alertness ratings was completed by a large sample of industrial shiftworkers. The respondents worked 12 hour shift systems that either did or did not incorporate breaks of > 24 hours between the blocks of day and night shifts. For the purposes of the analysis, each of these two groups were further subdivided into those who started their morning shift at 0600 and those who started at 0700. RESULTS: Systems which incorporated rest days between the day and night shifts were associated with slightly higher levels of on shift alertness, slightly lower levels of chronic fatigue, along with longer sleep durations when working night shifts and between rest days. Early changeovers were associated with shorter night sleeps between successive day shifts, but longer and less disturbed day sleeps between night shifts. These effects of changeover time were broadly in agreement with previous research findings. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of rest days in 12 hour shift systems had only limited effects on the outcome measures, although the few modest differences that were found favoured systems which incorporated rest days between the day and night shifts. It is conceded that the design of the study may have obscured some subtle differences between the shift systems. Nevertheless, it is concluded that the impact of distribution of rest days seems to be minor relative to previously found effects of other features of shift systems [...] for example, shift duration...|$|R
40|$|Travel demand Management (TDM) {{focuses on}} {{improving}} {{the efficiency of}} the transportation system through changing traveler 2 ̆ 7 s travel behavior rather than expanding the infrastructure. An employer based integrated TDM program generally includes strategies designed to change the commuter 2 ̆ 7 s travel behavior in terms of mode choice, time choice and travel frequency. Research on TDM has focused on the evaluation of the effectiveness of TDM program to report progress and find effective strategies. Another research area, identified as high-priority research need by TRB TDM innovation and research symposium 1994 [Transportation Research Circular, 1994], is to develop tools to predict the impact of TDM strategies in the future. These tools are necessary for integrating TDM into the transportation planning process and developing realistic expectations. Most previous research on TDM impact evaluation was worksite-based, retrospective, and focused on only one or more aspects of TDM strategies. That research is generally based on survey data with small sample size due to lack of detailed information on TDM programs and promotions and commuter travel behavior patterns, which cast doubts on its findings because of potential small sample bias and self-selection bias. Additionally, the worksite-based approach has several limitations that affect the accuracy and application of analysis results. Based on the Washington State Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) dataset, this dissertation focuses on analyzing the participation rates of <b>compressed</b> <b>work</b> week <b>schedules</b> and telecommuting for the CTR affected employees, modeling the determinants of commuter 2 ̆ 7 s <b>compressed</b> <b>work</b> week <b>schedules</b> and telecommuting choices, and analyzing the quantitative impacts of an integrated TDM program on individual commuter 2 ̆ 7 s mode choice. The major findings of this dissertation may have important policy implications and help TDM practitioners better understand the effectiveness of the TDM strategies in terms of person trip and vehicle trip reduction. The models developed in this dissertation may be used to evaluate the impacts of an existing TDM program. More importantly, they may be incorporated into the regional transportation model to reflect the TDM impacts in the transportation planning process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Project-based {{construction}} {{workers in the}} Australian construction industry work long and irregular hours and experience higher levels of work-to-family conflict and burnout than office-based workers, giving rise to an interest in alternative <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> {{as a means of}} supporting work-life balance. Alternative <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> were implemented in four case study construction projects in Australia. Interventions differed between projects, with two implementing a <b>compressed</b> <b>work</b> week, and the others introducing reduced hours schedules (one of which was optional). Data were collected from each case study project, using various combinations of focus groups, surveys, interviews and daily diary collection methods. The results were mixed. The <b>compressed</b> <b>work</b> week appears to have been favourably received where it was introduced. However, waged workers still expressed concerns about the impact on their weekly 'take-home' pay. Attempts to reduce work hours by changing from a six- to a five-day schedule (without extending the length of the working day between Monday and Friday) were less favourably received. Waged workers, in particular, did not favour reduced hours schedules. The results confirm the existence of two distinct labour markets operating in the Australian construction industry and markedly different responses to alternative <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> based upon whether workers are waged or salaried. The results clearly show that attempts to improve work-life balance must take the structural characteristics of the industry's labour markets into consideration in the design of interventions.

For early childhood children (age 3 or 4) in two-parent families, maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly varying hours, were associated with better academic outcomes, while paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly rotating shift and varying hours, were associated with lower academic outcomes. However, the positive impact of maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedule</b> disappeared for early childhood children in single-parent families. For middle childhood children (age 5 - 10), maternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules</b> were found to have no impact on children 2 ̆ 7 s academic achievement both in two-parent and single-parent families, whereas paternal nonstandard <b>work</b> <b>schedules,</b> particularly evening shift, had a negative effect in two-parent families.
