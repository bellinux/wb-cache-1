40|$|Effect of the {{nucleation}} mechanism on {{structure of}} polyfunctional <b>calcium</b> <b>silicophosphate</b> glass materials has been studied. It {{has been established}} that the structure differentiation via liquation mechanism with formation of the nanoscale spherical nonuniformities within microbeads and consequent structure arrangement prove the ides studied materials with glass-crystalline structure during thermal treatment. Provision of fine volume crystallization of carbon-hydroxyapatite {{in the structure of}} materials with the crystal size of about 1 Î¼m allows obtaining bioactive glass materials and coatings for bone implants with mechanical properties that allow their application on loaded areas of a bone...|$|E
