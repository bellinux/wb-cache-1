500|$|In December 2006, George W. Bush showed dissatisfaction when he {{was asked}} if he was in denial about the {{situation}} in Iraq (the most Bush had said about the situation was that the increase in attacks was [...] "unsettling"). Bush replied [...] "It's bad in Iraq. Does that help?". He had another run-in with Bush at a press conference at Camp David, when Bush asked him [...] "you still hanging around?". He then suggested to Robinson, with reference {{to the fact that it}} was a hot day, that [...] "next time you should <b>cover</b> <b>your</b> bald head". As Bush walked away, Robinson replied [...] "I didn't know you cared", to which Bush responded [...] "I don't". Robinson described his quip as a [...] "fatal error" [...] on his blog. In a final encounter in 2008, Bush joked with Robinson about still not wearing his hat.|$|E

2500|$|Any keenness of the Scots {{to attack}} {{is because they}} don't {{understand}} the superiority of Norman equipment: [...] "And let not their rashness move you, because so many insignia of your valour cause no alarm to them. They know not how to arm themselves for battle; whereas you, {{during the time of}} peace, prepare yourselves for war, in order that in battle you may not experience the doubtful contingencies of warfare. <b>Cover</b> <b>your</b> heads then with the helmet, your breasts with the coat of mail, your legs with the greaves, and your bodies with the shield, that so the foeman may not find where to strike at you, on seeing you thus surrounded on every side with iron." ...|$|E

2500|$|Immediately after {{finishing}} at Tuskegee, Stewart moved to New York and enrolled at New York University, where {{he earned a}} law certificate in 1896 {{and worked as a}} legal assistant in his father's law office. [...] A strong follower of Washington's principles, Stewart's father operated his office and his business relationship with his son under strict guidelines. [...] He required that his son sign a contract which specified his employment and compensation in detail, noting that [...] "my intention is to pay you $3 per week to <b>cover</b> <b>your</b> fare, lunches; allow you 5% of all my fees; at 21, I shall make you Notary Public and put your name on the door." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nick Cotton {{has become}} one of EastEnders most renowned villains. His 'nastiness' was voted the 25th [...] "Greatest Soap Moment" [...] in a Five poll in 2004, and he has also been voted the 4th most villainous {{television}} character in a Channel 4 poll. The Guardian columnist Charlie Brooker has denied Nick's villainous characterisation however, writing: [...] "The man simply isn't menacing; he's half as terrifying as an Argos catalogue. Whereas [...] Jez Quigley looked as though he'd enjoy riding an onyx stallion through a field full of groaning, recently-impaled victims before galloping home to bathe in the blood of the fallen, Nick Cotton merely looks like he might, at a push, dispute the price of a dented tin of custard with a supermarket checkout girl while you wait behind him, wondering when he last washed his hair." [...] The Timess Fiona McCade satirised the character when Altman appeared on the children's TV show Balamory, advising parents to: [...] "be prepared to <b>cover</b> <b>your</b> little ones’ eyes as the bad boy of soap strides into the colourful, fictional paradise, no doubt goosing Miss Hoolie, upsetting PC Plum and making Josie jump. I also fear for the safety of Archie, the chubby, cheerful posh boy who wears a pink kilt and lives alone in a big pink castle. With Nick in town, he doesn’t stand a chance." ...|$|E
