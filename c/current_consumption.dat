5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates {{the extent to which}} a country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets is known as a borrower, exchanging future payments for <b>current</b> <b>consumption.</b> Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E

40|$|For {{copyright}} protection of software for microcontrollers, {{it is important}} for developer to know real information about the degree of their security against unauthorized reading. Known methods of unauthorized reading of information by <b>consumption</b> <b>current,</b> such as the simple power analysis and the differential power analysis, are simple to perform, have low cost, and are carried out without destruction of chips. Perspective way of protection against such reading is masking of <b>consumption</b> <b>current.</b> Authors offer to create such adjustable filter of <b>consumption</b> <b>current</b> which would bring hindrances in <b>consumption</b> <b>current</b> of the microcontroller. To define type of the noise generator, which is necessary for control of adjustable filter, and also noise frequency, coefficients of mutual correlation between <b>consumption</b> <b>current</b> without masking and with masking by means of adjustable filter, depending on type of the generator of noise and on its frequency are defined. On the basis of the generator of noise, four devices of filters of a microprocessor powering system with protection of <b>consumption</b> <b>current</b> are developed. Comparison of the offered filters against existing systems of protection is executed, and determined, that the offered <b>consumption</b> <b>current</b> filters have the best efficiency. ??? ?????? ????????? ???? ???????????? ?????? ?? ????????????????? ????? ????? ???????? ?????????? ? ??????? ?? ???????????? ?? ???????????????????? ??????????. ???????? ?????? ???????????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?? ???? ???????????, ????? ??? ??????? ?????? ???? ??????????? ? ???????????????? ?????? ???? ???????????, ?????? ??? ??????????, ????? ?????? ?????????, ? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ?????????. ????????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ?????????? ???????? ???????????? ???? ???????????. ???????? ?????????? ??????? ????? ???????????? ?????? ???? ???????????, ??????? ?? ?????? ?????? ? ??? ??????????? ????????????????. ??? ????, ????? ?????????? ??? ?????????? ????, ??????????? ??? ?????????? ???????????? ????????, ? ????? ??????? ????, ?????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ????? ????? ??????????? ??? ???????????? ? ? ????????????? ??? ?????? ????????????? ???????, ? ??????????? ?? ???? ?????????? ???? ? ?? ??? ???????. ?? ???? ?????????? ???? ??????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ????????????????? ??????? ? ??????? ?? ???? ???????????. ????????? ????????? ???????????? ???????? ? ????????????? ????????? ??????, ? ???????????, ??? ?????????? ????????????? ????? ???????????? ??????? ???? ??????????? ?????????????????...|$|R

25|$|Natural gas was {{discovered}} accidentally in ancient China, as it {{resulted from the}} drilling for brines. The natural gas was used to boil brine to make salt. Natural gas was first used by the Chinese in about 500 BCE (possibly even 1000 BCE). They discovered a way to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo {{to where it was}} used to boil salt water to extract the salt, in the Ziliujing District of Sichuan. The world's first industrial extraction of natural gas started at Fredonia, New York, United States, in 1825. By 2009, 66 000km³ (or 8%) had been used out of the total 850 000km³ of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas. Based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3400km³ of gas per year, the total estimated remaining economically recoverable reserves of natural gas would last 250 years at <b>current</b> <b>consumption</b> rates.

Methods: Detailed data were collected using the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Meat Questionnaire. Results: Total <b>current</b> meat <b>consumption</b> was greater in men with than without ET (135. 3 ± 71. 1 vs. 110. 6 ± 80. 4 g/day, p = 0. 03) but not in women with versus without ET (80. 6 ± 50. 0 vs. 79. 3 ± 51. 0 g/day, p = 0. 76). In an adjusted logistic regression analysis in males, higher total <b>current</b> meat <b>consumption</b> was associated with ET (OR = 1. 006, p = 0. 04, i. e., with 10 additional g/day of meat, odds of ET increased by 6 %).
