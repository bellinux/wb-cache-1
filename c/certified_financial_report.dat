40|$|This article builds upon {{calls for}} {{a shift in the}} {{paradigm}} of the accounting discipline, away from preparing or <b>certifying</b> <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> of management activities aimed at maximizing share-holder wealth toward recognition that businesses must also be accountable to other stakeholders and indeed the community at large. If individuals in business apply a sound moral compass to their activities and decisions, we believe that commerce can shift toward outcomes that may not only satisfy shareholders but also contribute to the common good. In this article, we are con-cerned with the role of accounting and business education. We enumerate recommendations to-ward achieving this paradigm shift from profit maximization to social justice.

The dangers created by risky practices of financial institutions “too big to fail ” and the systemic risk of a global marketplace have not been resolved.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether family ties between companies’ director-owners and their auditors impacts audit quality in companies {{listed on the}} Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE). I use discretionary accruals and restatements to proxy for audit quality. The sample is constructed by hand-collecting <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> from KSE-listed companies for the period 2000 - 2012 (2005 - 2012 for restatements sample). I am able to identify family ties by matching the family names of director-owners who <b>certify</b> the <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> to the family names of audit partners in the firms that audit these companies. My results indicate that companies whose director-owners have family ties to their auditors report higher-quality accruals, suggesting higher audit quality. The {{results are consistent with}} the following incentives to appoint family-tied auditors in Kuwait (identified through interviews with director-owners, managers, and auditors) : reduce information asymmetry, implement stricter monitoring on management, enhance <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality, enhance confidentiality and trust between director-owners and auditors, facilitate communication and information flow, and protect ownership interests. ...|$|R
