5|$|The vast {{majority}} of refugees were motivated by economic concerns and sought to improve their living conditions and opportunities by migrating to the West. Events such as the crushing of the 1953 uprising, the imposition of <b>collectivisation</b> and East Germany's final economic crisis in the late 1980s prompted surges {{in the number of}} escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|However, this outward {{dullness}} concealed a sharp {{mind and}} great administrative talent. He operated mainly {{behind the scenes}} and cultivated {{an image of a}} colourless bureaucrat – for example, he was the only Bolshevik leader who always wore a suit and tie. In 1928 Molotov replaced Nikolai Uglanov as First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party and held that position until 15 August 1929. In a lengthy address to the Central Committee in 1929, Molotov told the members the Soviet government would initiate a compulsory <b>collectivisation</b> campaign to solve the agrarian backwardness of Soviet agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Stalin's early {{policies}} {{pushed for}} rapid industrialisation, nationalisation of private {{industry and the}} <b>collectivisation</b> of private plots created under Lenin's New Economic Policy. As leader of the Politburo, Stalin consolidated near-absolute power by 1938 after the Great Purge, a series of campaigns of political repression and persecution. Nazi German troops invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, but were repulsed by the Soviets in December. On Stalin's orders, the USSR launched a counter-attack on Nazi Germany. Stalin died in March 1953, his death triggered a power struggle in which Nikita Khrushchev after several years emerged victorious against Georgy Malenkov.|$|E
5|$|Upon taking power, Lenin's regime {{issued a}} series of decrees. The first was a Decree on Land, which {{declared}} that the landed estates of the aristocracy and the Orthodox Church should be nationalised and redistributed to peasants by local governments. This contrasted with Lenin's desire for agricultural <b>collectivisation</b> but provided governmental recognition of the widespread peasant land seizures that had already occurred. In November 1917, the government issued the Decree on the Press that closed many opposition media outlets deemed counter-revolutionary. They claimed the measure would be temporary; the decree was widely criticised, including by many Bolsheviks, for compromising freedom of the press.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{expected to}} reach these targets with economic aid from the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON) and loans from international agencies of the capitalist world. The 4th National Congress {{made it clear that}} agriculture would be socialised; however, during the Second Five-Year Plan the socialisation measures went so badly that Võ Chí Công, a Politburo member and Chairman of the Committee for the Socialist Transformation of Agriculture, claimed {{it would be impossible to}} meet the targets set by the plan by 1980. An estimated 10,000 out of 13,246 socialist cooperatives, established during the plan, had collapsed in the South by 1980. Politburo member Lê Thanh Nghị attacked lower-level cadres for the failure of the socialist agriculture transformation. The <b>collectivisation</b> process led to an abrupt drop in food production in 1977 and 1978, leading the 6th Plenum of the Central Committee to completely overhaul the Party's agricultural policies.|$|E
5|$|Soviet rule of Estonia was re-established by force, and sovietisation followed, {{which was}} mostly {{carried out in}} 1944–1950. The forced <b>collectivisation</b> of {{agriculture}} began in 1947, and was completed after the mass deportation of Estonians in March 1949. All private farms were confiscated, and farmers were made to join the collective farms. An armed resistance movement of 'forest brothers' was active until the mass deportations. A total of 30,000 participated or supported the movement; 2,000 were killed. The Soviet authorities fighting the forest brothers suffered also hundreds of deaths. Among those killed on both sides were innocent civilians. Besides the armed resistance of the forest brothers, a number of underground nationalist schoolchildren groups were active. Most of their members were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. The punitive actions decreased rapidly after Joseph Stalin's death in 1953; from 1956–58, {{a large part of}} the deportees and political prisoners were allowed to return to Estonia. Political arrests and numerous other crimes against humanity were committed all through the occupation period until the late 1980s. After all, the attempt to integrate Estonian society into the Soviet system failed. Although the armed resistance was defeated, the population remained anti-Soviet. This helped the Estonians to organise a new resistance movement in the late 1980s, regain their independence in 1991, and then rapidly develop a modern society.|$|E

25|$|<b>Collectivisation</b> in the Baltic {{states was}} {{introduced}} in early 1947, but the progress was slow. Despite new heavy taxes on farmers and intense propaganda, only about 3% of farms in Lithuania and Estonia joined kolkhozes {{by the end of}} 1948. Borrowing from the <b>collectivisation</b> experiences of the early 1930s, kulaks were named as the primary obstacle and became targets of repressions.|$|E
25|$|Across Eastern Europe, the Soviet {{model was}} enforced, with a {{termination}} of political pluralism, agricultural <b>collectivisation,</b> {{and investment in}} heavy industry. It was aimed for economic autarky within the Eastern Bloc. Monarchies were removed from power in Romania and Bulgaria.|$|E
25|$|However, the Soviet {{authorities}} {{then started}} {{a campaign of}} forced <b>collectivisation,</b> which largely nullified the earlier gains from the land reform as the peasants generally {{did not want to}} join the Kolkhoz farms, nor to give away their crops for free to fulfill the state-imposed quotas.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, the Politburo {{announced}} the mass <b>collectivisation</b> of agriculture, establishing both kolkhozy collective farms and sovkhoz state farms. Stalin stipulated that kulaks would {{be barred from}} joining these collectives. Although officially voluntary, many peasants joined the collectives out of fear they would face {{the fate of the}} kulaks; others joined amid intimidation and violence from party loyalists.|$|E
25|$|The {{deportation}} was a {{shock to}} Estonian and Latvian societies. The rate of <b>collectivisation</b> jumped from 8% to 64% from 20 March to 20 April in Estonia and from 11% to more than 50% from 12 March to 9 April in Latvia. By the end of the year, 80% Estonian and 93% Latvian farms joined kolkhozes. In Lithuania, which had the stronger Forest Brother movement and already experienced a mass deportation in May 1948 (Operation Vesna), the impact was not as great and the <b>collectivisation</b> rate was 62% by the end of 1949. Therefore, the Soviets organized another large deportation from Lithuania in April 1949 specifically targeting those who had escaped the Operation Priboi (approx. 3,000 people) and another mass deportation known as Operation Osen in fall 1951 (more than 20,000 people). Search and individual arrests of people who evaded deportation continued in Estonia until at least fall 1949.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failure}} of forced <b>collectivisation</b> that was {{attempted}} from 1949–53, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as workers self-management, was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader Edvard Kardelj, the main ideologue of the Titoist path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from {{within and outside the}} Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to the Goli otok.|$|E
25|$|The forced <b>collectivisation</b> of {{agriculture}} began in 1947, and was completed after the mass deportation in March 1949 (see Operation Priboi). Private farms were confiscated, and farmers {{were made to}} join the collective farms. In all three countries, Baltic partisans, known colloquially as the Forest Brothers, Latvian national partisans, and Lithuanian partisans, waged unsuccessful guerrilla warfare against the Soviet occupation for {{the next eight years}} in a bid to regain their nations' independence. Although the armed resistance was defeated, the population remained anti-Soviet.|$|E
25|$|Largely {{the same}} groups were {{responsible}} for the mass killing operations during the civil war, <b>collectivisation,</b> and the Great Terror. These groups were associated with Yefim Yevdokimov (1891–1939) and operated in the Secret Operational Division within General State Political Administration (OGPU) in 1929–31. Evdokimov transferred into Communist Party administration in 1934, when he became Party secretary for North Caucasus Krai. He appears to have continued advising Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Yezhov on security matters, and the latter relied on Evdokimov's former colleagues to carry out the mass killing operations that are known as the Great Terror in 1937–38.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of forced <b>collectivisation</b> under Joseph Stalin at least a million persons died, mostly in the Kazakh SSR. Islam, {{as well as other}} religions, were also attacked. In the Second World War several million {{refugees}} and hundreds of factories were moved to the relative security of Central Asia; and the region permanently became {{an important part of the}} Soviet industrial complex. Several important military facilities were also located in the region, including nuclear testing facilities and the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Virgin Lands Campaign, starting in 1954, was a massive Soviet agricultural resettlement program that brought more than 300,000 individuals, mostly from the Ukraine, to the northern Kazakh SSR and the Altai region of the Russian SFSR. This was a major change in the ethnicity of the region.|$|E
25|$|Between 1945 and 1985, the Soviet Union {{carried out}} a process of sovietization which aimed to weaken the {{national}} identities of the Baltic peoples. An {{important factor in the}} attempt to achieve this was large-scale industrialisation then direct attacks on culture, religion and freedom of expression. For the Soviet authorities the elimination of opposition and the transformation of the economics went hand in hand. The Soviet used massive deportations to eliminate resistance to <b>collectivisation</b> and support for the partisans. The Baltic partisans resisted Soviet rule by armed struggle for a number of years. The Estonian Forest brothers, as they were known, enjoyed material support among the local population. The Soviets had already carried out deportations in 1940–41, but the deportations between 1944 and 1952 were much larger in number. In March 1949, the top Soviet authorities organised a mass deportation of 90,000 Baltic nationals, whom they labelled as enemies of the people, to inhospitable areas of the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The 1932 {{competition}} for the Palace of the Soviets, a grandiose project to rival the Empire State Building, featured entries from all the major Constructivists as well as Walter Gropius, Erich Mendelsohn and Le Corbusier. However, this coincided with widespread criticism of Modernism, which was always difficult to sustain in a still mostly agrarian country. There was also the critique that the style merely copied the forms of technology while using fairly routine construction methods. The winning entry by Boris Iofan marked the start of eclectic historicism of Stalinist Architecture, a style which bears similarities to Post-Modernism in that it reacted against modernist architecture's cosmopolitanism, alleged ugliness and inhumanity with a pick and mix of historical styles, sometimes achieved with new technology. Housing projects like the Narkomfin were designed for the attempts to reform everyday life in the 1920s, such as <b>collectivisation</b> of facilities, equality of the sexes and collective raising of children, all of which fell out of favour as Stalinism revived family values. The styles {{of the old world}} were also revived, with the Moscow Metro in particular popularising the idea of 'workers' palaces'.|$|E
25|$|The {{border between}} East and West Berlin was also {{significantly}} tightened, {{although it was}} not fully closed at this stage. By the end of September 1952, about 200 of the 277 streets which ran from the Western sectors to the East were closed to traffic and the remainder were subjected to constant police observation. Railway traffic was routed around the Western sectors and all employees of nationalised factories had to pledge not to visit West Berlin on pain of dismissal. However, even with these restrictions the border in Berlin remained considerably easier to cross than the main inner German border; consequently, Berlin became the main route by which East Germans left for the West. The outflow of people remained considerable despite the new restrictions. Between 1949and the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, an estimated 3.5million East Germans– a sixth of East Germany's entire population– emigrated to the West. Events such as the crushing of the 1953 uprising and the shortages caused by the introduction of <b>collectivisation</b> resulted in major increases in refugee numbers. In August 1961, the Berlin Wall was built, finally putting an end to the stream of refugees. With the erection of the Wall, Berlin quickly went from being the easiest place to make an unauthorized crossing between East and West Germany to being the most difficult.|$|E
25|$|After {{existing}} as {{an independent}} country for twenty-one years, the Soviet Union occupied and annexed Estonia in June 1940 during World War II. In 1941–1944, Estonia was occupied by Nazi Germany. From February to November 1944, the German forces were expelled by the Red Army. The Soviet rule was re-established by force, and sovietisation followed, mostly carried out in 1944–1950. The forced <b>collectivisation</b> of agriculture began in 1947, and was completed after the mass deportation in March 1949. The Soviet authorities confiscated the private farms and made the peasants to join the collective farms. An armed resistance movement of forest brothers was active until the mass deportations.

500|$|During the Central Committee plenum of 19 December 1930, Alexey Rykov, the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (the {{equivalent}} of a Western head of government) was succeeded by Molotov. In this post, Molotov oversaw the Stalin regime's <b>collectivisation</b> of agriculture. He followed Stalin's line by {{using a combination of}} force and propaganda to crush peasant resistance to <b>collectivisation,</b> including the deportation of millions of kulaks (peasants with property) to gulags. An enormous number of the deportees died from exposure and overwork. He signed the Law of Spikelets and personally led the Extraordinary Commission for Grain Delivery in Ukraine, which seized a reported 4.2 million tonnes of grain from the peasants during a widespread manmade famine (later known as the [...] "Holodomor" [...] to Ukrainians). Contemporary historians estimate that between seven and eleven million people died, either of starvation or in gulags, in the process of farm collectivization. Molotov also oversaw the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan for rapid industrialisation.|$|E
500|$|Kenyatta was a Pan-Africanist. Assensoh {{suggested}} that Kenyatta initially had socialist inclinations but [...] "became {{a victim of}} capitalist circumstances"; conversely, Savage stated that [...] "Kenyatta's direction was hardly towards {{the creation of a}} radical new socialist society". When in power, he displayed a preoccupation with individual and mbari land rights that were at odds with any socialist-oriented <b>collectivisation.</b> He had been exposed to Marxist-Leninist ideas through his friendship with Padmore and the time spent in the Soviet Union, but had also been exposed to Western forms of liberal democratic government through his many years in Britain.|$|E
500|$|In 1864 the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes {{called the}} [...] "First International") united diverse revolutionary {{currents}} including French followers of Proudhon, Blanquists, Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and social democrats. Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation. Karl Marx became a leading {{figure in the}} International {{and a member of}} its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the mutualists, opposed Marx's state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings. Woodcock also reports that the American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and William B. Greene had been members of the First International. In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the League of Peace and Freedom (LPF), Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF). They allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow {{of the state and the}} <b>collectivisation</b> of property.|$|E
2500|$|Nor {{could they}} risk mass {{starvation}} or agricultural sabotage (e.g., holodomor) with a rapid <b>collectivisation</b> through massive state farms and agricultural producers' cooperatives (APCs). [...] Instead, <b>collectivisation</b> proceeded more slowly and in stages from 1948 to 1960 in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, and from 1955 to 1964 in Albania. [...] <b>Collectivisation</b> in the Baltic {{republics of the}} Lithuanian SSR, Estonian SSR and Latvian SSR took place between 1947 and 1952.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Collectivisation</b> often {{met with}} strong rural resistance, {{including}} peasants frequently destroying property rather than surrendering {{it to the}} collectives. Strong peasant links with the land through private ownership were broken and many young people left for careers in industry. [...] In Poland and Yugoslavia, fierce resistance from peasants, {{many of whom had}} resisted the Axis, led to the abandonment of wholesale rural <b>collectivisation</b> in the early 1950s. [...] In part because of the problems created by <b>collectivisation,</b> agriculture was largely de-collectivised in Poland in 1957.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Babel {{travelled}} in Ukraine {{and witnessed}} {{the brutality of}} forced <b>collectivisation</b> and dekulakisation. Although he never made a public statement about this, he privately confided in Antonina, [...] "The bounty {{of the past is}} gone -- it is due to the famine in Ukraine and the destruction of the village across our land." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Collectivisation</b> is {{a process}} pioneered by Joseph Stalin in the late 1920s by which Marxist-Leninist regimes in the Eastern Bloc and {{elsewhere}} attempted to establish an ordered socialist system in rural agriculture. [...] It required the forced consolidation of small-scale peasant farms and larger holdings belonging to the landed classes {{for the purpose of}} creating larger modern [...] "collective farms" [...] owned, in theory, by the workers therein or the state.|$|E
2500|$|By 1932, about 62% of {{households}} involved in agriculture {{were part of}} collectives, and by 1936 this had risen to 90%. Many of the peasants who had been collectivised resented {{the loss of their}} private farmland, and productivity slumped. Famine broke out in many areas, with the Politburo frequently ordering the distribution of emergency food relief to these regions. Armed peasant uprisings against dekulakisation and <b>collectivisation</b> broke out in Ukraine, northern Caucasus, southern Russia, and central Asia, reaching their apex in March 1930; these were repressed by the Red Army. Stalin responded to the uprisings with an article insisting that <b>collectivisation</b> was voluntary and blaming any violence and other excesses on local officials. Bukharin expressed concerns about these policies; he regarded them as a return to Lenin's old [...] "war communism" [...] policy and believed that it would fail. However, by the summer of 1928 he was unable to rally sufficient support in the party to oppose the reforms. In November 1929 Stalin removed him from the Politburo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} Poland {{nevertheless}} managed {{to carry out}} large-scale centrally planned industrialisation with no more difficulty than its collectivised Eastern Bloc neighbours further called into question the need for <b>collectivisation</b> in such planned economies. [...] Only Poland's [...] "western territories", those eastwardly adjacent to the Oder-Neisse line that were annexed from Germany, were substantially collectivised, largely in order to settle large numbers of Poles on good farmland which {{had been taken from}} German farmers.|$|E
2500|$|Although it {{contains}} passages {{written in the}} 1910s and 1920s, Doctor Zhivago was not completed until 1956. Pasternak submitted the novel to [...] "Новый Мир" [...] (Novy Mir), which refused publication due to its rejection of socialist realism. The author, like his protagonist Yuri Zhivago, showed more concern {{for the welfare of}} individual characters than for the [...] "progress" [...] of society. Censors also regarded some passages as anti-Soviet, especially the novel's criticisms of Stalinism, <b>Collectivisation,</b> the Great Purge, and the Gulag.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to eradicating the perceived inefficiencies associated with small-scale farming on discontiguous land holdings, <b>collectivisation</b> also purported {{to achieve the}} political goal of removing the rural basis for resistance to Stalinist regimes. A further justification given was the need to promote industrial development by facilitating the state's procurement of agricultural products and transferring [...] "surplus labor" [...] from rural to urban areas. In short, agriculture was reorganised in order to proletarianise the peasantry and control production at prices determined by the state.|$|E
2500|$|The Eastern Bloc {{possesses}} substantial agricultural resources, {{especially in}} southern areas, such as Hungary's Great Plain, which offered good soils {{and a warm}} climate during the growing season. Rural <b>collectivisation</b> proceeded differently in non-Soviet Eastern Bloc countries {{than it did in}} the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s. [...] Because of the need to conceal of the assumption of control and the realities of an initial lack of control, no Soviet dekulakisation-style liquidation of rich peasants could be carried out in the non-Soviet Eastern Bloc countries.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviets also modeled {{economies in}} the rest of Eastern Bloc outside the Soviet Union along Soviet command economy lines. [...] Before World War II, the Soviet Union used {{draconian}} procedures to ensure compliance with directives to invest all assets in state planned manners, including the <b>collectivisation</b> of agriculture and utilising a sizeable labor army collected in the gulag system. [...] This system was largely imposed on other Eastern Bloc countries after World War II. [...] While propaganda of proletarian improvements accompanied systemic changes, terror and intimidation of the consequent ruthless Stalinism obfuscated feelings of any purported benefits.|$|E
2500|$|Parts of the Ukrainian {{population}} initially {{welcomed the}} end of Polish rule and the phenomenon was strengthened by a land reform. The Soviet authorities also started a limited <b>collectivisation</b> campaign. There were large groups of prewar Polish citizens, notably Jewish youth, and, to a lesser extent, Ukrainian peasants, who saw the Soviet power {{as an opportunity to}} start political or social activity outside of their traditional ethnic or cultural groups. Their enthusiasm faded with time as {{it became clear that the}} Soviet repressions affected everybody. The organisation of Ukrainians desiring independent Ukraine (the OUN) was persecuted as [...] "anti-Soviet".|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{from the}} late 1920s with a {{centrally}} planned economy, Ukraine was involved in Soviet industrialisation and the republic's industrial output quadrupled during the 1930s. The peasantry suffered from the programme of <b>collectivisation</b> of agriculture which began during and {{was part of the}} first five-year plan and was enforced by regular troops and secret police. Those who resisted were arrested and deported and agricultural productivity greatly declined. As members of the collective farms were sometimes not allowed to receive any grain until unrealistic quotas were met, millions starved to death in a famine known as the Holodomor or the [...] "Great Famine".|$|E
2500|$|Unlike Soviet <b>collectivisation,</b> neither massive {{destruction}} of livestock nor errors causing distorted output or distribution {{occurred in the}} other Eastern Bloc countries. [...] More widespread use of transitional forms occurred, with differential compensation payments for peasants that contributed more land to APCs. [...] Because Czechoslovakia and East Germany were more industrialised than the Soviet Union, {{they were in a}} position to furnish most of the equipment and fertiliser inputs needed to ease the transition to collectivised agriculture. Instead of liquidating large farmers or barring them from joining APCs as Stalin had done through dekulakisation, those farmers were utilised in the non-Soviet Eastern Bloc collectivisations, sometimes even being named farm chairman or managers. [...] Massive industrialisation eventually caused young men to move to urban centres, depressing agricultural productivity.|$|E
