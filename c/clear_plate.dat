6000|$|It {{was under}} the {{influence}} of this last reflexion that Densher again delayed; and it was while he delayed that something else occurred to him. It was all round, visibly--given his own new contribution--a case of pressure; and in a case of pressure Kate, for quicker knowledge, might have come out with her aunt. The possibility that in this event she might be sitting in the carriage--the thing most likely--had had the effect, before he could check it, of bringing him within range of the window. It wasn't there he had wished to see her; yet if she was there he couldn't pretend not to. What he had however the next moment made out was that if some one was there it wasn't Kate Croy. It was, with a sensible shock for him, the person who had last offered him a conscious face from behind the <b>clear</b> <b>plate</b> of a café in Venice. The great glass at Florian's was a medium less obscure, even with the window down, than the air of the London Christmas; yet at present also, none the less, between the two men, an exchange of recognitions could occur. Densher felt his own look a gaping arrest--which, he disgustedly remembered, his back as quickly turned, appeared to repeat itself as his special privilege. He mounted the steps of the house and touched the bell with a keen consciousness of being habitually looked at by Kate's friend from positions of almost insolent vantage. He forgot for the time the moment when, in Venice, at the palace, the encouraged young man had in a manner assisted at the departure of the disconcerted, since Lord Mark was not looking disconcerted now any more than he had looked from his bench at his café. Densher was thinking that he seemed to show as vagrant while another was ensconced. He was thinking of the other as--in spite of the difference of situation--more ensconced than ever; he was thinking of him above all as the friend of the person with whom his recognition had, the minute previous, associated him. The man was seated in the very place in which, beside Mrs. Lowder's, he had looked to find Kate, and that was a sufficient identity. Meanwhile at any rate the door of the house had opened and Mrs. Lowder stood before him. It was something at least that she wasn't Kate. She was herself, on the spot, in all her affluence; with presence of mind both to decide at once that Lord Mark, in the brougham, didn't matter and to prevent Sir Luke's butler, by a firm word thrown over her shoulder, from standing there to listen to her passage with the gentleman who had rung. [...] "I'll tell Mr. Densher; you needn't wait!" [...] And the passage, promptly and richly, took place on the steps.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} for this thesis {{experience}} {{is to examine}} the connections and correlations between two-dimensional imagery and threedimensional form. The concept for this exploration came from genuine personal interest and sensitivity for multiple materials, techniques, and the dynamics and energy they create in relation to each other and their environment. My intention was to create a total environment in which the viewer receives not just a single frame perspective of a visual image or object, but instead becomes an interactive part of the space. This need to expand my work beyond a single object or pictorial frame of painting or photograph has evolved over the years from many different personal experiences and through my observation of other artists working in non-object orientations. Two artists that I have been particularly influenced by in terms of materials and use of space are the contemporary works of the Czech glass artists Dana Zamecnikova and her husband Marion Karel. Dana 2 ̆ 7 s work successfully utilizes both image and form by creating distinct interactive relationships between the two.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Science and IndustryJim L. NelssenThree {{experiments}} used 777 pigs {{to study}} the effects of fiber source; wheat middlings (midds), dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS), and choice white grease (CWG), and reduction strategies for growing and finishing pigs. Also a fourth study utilizing 1, 360 pigs was conducted to determine the effect of immunocastration (IC) and DDGS withdrawal on growth performance, carcass characteristics, fatty acid analysis, and iodine value (IV) of pork fat depots in growing and finishing pigs. Experiment 1 determined that the ingredient source of fiber (wheat middlings or DDGS) was more important than NDF level alone, for characterization of growth, carcass, and yield responses. Experiment 2 showed that a short (23 d) fiber reduction strategy was successful at fully recovering yield loss; however, a longer reduction (47 d) was necessary for further improvements in carcass fat quality (IV). Experiment 3 further proved that yield loss can be recovered with a short fiber reduction strategy (19 d), and that adding energy from CWG during the fiber reduction period can improve feed efficiency, but was unsuccessful at further improving carcass yield or carcass fat quality. Experiment 4 showed that carcass yield was lower for IC pigs than barrows regardless of dietary DDGS or withdrawal strategy. Also pigs fed 30 % DDGS throughout had decreased carcass yield; however, withdrawing DDGS from the diet on d 74 was effective at recovering the yield loss. While DDGS withdrawal strategy was successful at lowering IV, but was unsuccessful at fully lowering IV to values of pigs fed the control diet throughout. Iodine values were somewhat variable within fat depot, showing the jowl and <b>clear</b> <b>plate</b> fat were less accurate in showing changes from the diet, most likely due to the fact they are deposited earlier and are slower to turnover. Iodine value tended to be greater for IC pigs than barrows on d 107, but by d 125 there were no differences in IV between IC and barrows. This dramatic improvement from d 107 to 125 could be caused by the dilution of unsaturated fatty acids, specifically C 18 : 2 and C 18 : 3, due to the rapid deposition of fat in IC pigs...|$|E

[...] 1 pageThe current geodynamics of {{the region}} between north Africa and the Iberian Peninsula are {{dominated}} by the collision between the Eurasian and African plates. The ongoing deformation is mainly driven by the NW–SE, slow 4 - 5 mm/yr convergence that is partitioned across numerous faults and diffused through a broad region with no <b>clear</b> <b>plate</b> boundary defined. However, this region {{is characterized by the}} a series of geological structures that appear unrelated to the current dominant plate kinematics. The region is formed by the Gibraltar Arc system, an arcuate structure that is fronted by a large imbricated wedge of tectonically piled sediment slices in the Gulf of Cadiz, and a series of basins in the Mediterranean part {{of the region}}. The western, little deformed Alboran basin is located on the rear of the Gibraltar stacked units. The eastern Alboran basin is characterized by numerous volcanic ridges and is transitional to the South Balearic – North Algerian basin that displays a generally lower topography. The different tectonic elements are floored by a poorly known crystalline basement and their age, evolution and geodynamic origin is still strongly debated. Part of the uncertainty arises from the lack of deep penetrating modern geophysical data in much of the region. In the last 5 years, 3 successive cruise in the region have produced an extensive coverage of the different tectonic elements collection a series of wide angle seismic profiles in 2006 during the WestMed cruise with German R/V Meteor and two multichannel seismic reflection cruises with the R/V Sarmiento de Gamboa from mid September to late October (TopoMed-Gassis cruise) and late October to late November (Geomargen- 1 cruise) 2011. In this contribution we present the new images of the tectonic structures and sedimentary basin and the wide-angle seismic velocity models across key regions of the system. We also present an interpretation of the entire system {{in the context of a}} geodynamic model of eastward Miocene subduction, currently inactive, that may explain the structures observed in the data from the 3 cruises.

Test parameters, specimens, antigen or antibody, and conjugates for the two types of assays were identical except that p-nitrophenyl phosphate was used as the substrate for the ELISA and 4 -methylumbelliferyl phosphate was used as the substrate for ELFA. Automated readers were used for both assays. Antibody titers and sensitivity of antigen detection were quite similar for ELISA and ELFA. ELFA for rubella antibody, however, could be conducted with less antigen or shorter substrate incubation time (5 min for ELFA versus 30 min for ELISA). For herpes simplex virus antigen detection, ELFA could also be read after a shorter substrate incubation time (15 min for ELFA versus 30 min for ELISA). <b>Clear</b> polystyrene microtiter <b>plates</b> routinely used for ELISA could be used for ELFA, but <b>clear</b> polyvinyl chloride <b>plates</b> had high background fluorescence.
