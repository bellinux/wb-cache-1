50|$|Section {{three of}} the bill would direct the Secretary to provide veterans' <b>case-tracking</b> {{information}} access to employees of a state or local governmental agency assisting veterans with benefit claims. The bill would direct the Secretary to ensure that such access does not: (1) allow the employee to modify the data in the <b>case-tracking</b> system, or (2) include access to medical records. The bill would require such employees to complete a certification course on privacy issues before receiving such access.|$|E
5000|$|H.R. 1405 {{would make}} changes to certain {{administrative}} procedures and {{programs of the}} Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), including the fiduciary program, access to <b>case-tracking</b> information, and limits on bonuses for employees. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing H.R. 1405 would yield net discretionary savings of $108 million over the 2014-2018 period, assuming appropriation actions consistent with the bill. [...] Pay-as-you-go procedures {{do not apply to}} this legislation because it would not affect direct spending or revenues. H.R. 1405 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA).|$|E
5000|$|H.R. 1405 {{would require}} the Department of Veterans Affairs to include the {{appropriate}} appeals form whenever they reject a veteran's benefit claim. [...] The bill would also set up a way for state or local government agencies to gain view-only access to the <b>case-tracking</b> system {{so that they could}} help veterans with completing their claims. [...] The bill also outlines the rules under which the VA may assign, monitor, and interact with people acting on the behalf of a veteran - his or her fiduciary. Finally, the bill reduced from $400 million to $345 million the cap on the total amount of money that can be given out in bonuses each year to VA employees.|$|E
40|$|Radiologists {{make many}} diagnoses, but only {{sporadically}} get {{feedback on the}} subsequent clinical courses of their patients. We have created a web-based application that empowers radiologists to create and maintain personal databases of cases of interest. This tool integrates with existing information systems to minimize manual input such that radiologists can quickly flag cases for further follow-up without interrupting their clinical work. We have integrated this <b>case-tracking</b> system with an electronic medical record aggregation and search tool. As a result, radiologists can learn the outcomes of their patients with much less effort. We intend this tool to aid radiologists in their own personal quality improvement and {{to increase the efficiency}} of both teaching and research. We also hope to develop the system into a platform for systematic, continuous, quantitative monitoring of performance in radiology...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the burden of infectious disease within one immigration removal centre (IRC) in southern England using available data. We conducted {{a review of existing}} databases used to record cases of infectious disease and extracted health information from a random sample of 50  % of detainee medical notes. We found that there was poor correlation between routine databases and that no systematic infectious disease screening is undertaken within the IRC. However, infectious diseases were an important public health issue in the IRC: 2  % of detainees were recorded as being hepatitis B virus positive, 1  % were HIV positive, and 3  % had a diagnosis of Tuberculosis. This study's quantification of the burden of infectious diseases relies upon self-disclosure and therefore underestimates true prevalence. Consideration should be given to screening for infectious diseases in the IRC. Where disease is identified, systems for <b>case-tracking</b> are poorly aligned between services...|$|E
