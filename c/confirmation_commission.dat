500|$|The Spanish army's {{interest}} in the tank began {{near the end of}} World War I, when a formal petition for one Renault FT light tank was made to the French government on 28 October 1918. [...] This purchase, however, was not processed until 15 January 1919. Spain's Comisión de Experiencias, Proyectos y Comprobación del Material de Guerra (Experiences, Projects and <b>Confirmation</b> <b>Commission)</b> issued a formal order for an FT, armed with a [...] cannon, and days later extended the order to include another three cannon armed tanks, and another FT armed with a machine gun. On 5 March the order was authorized and then extended further to include two more FTs, armed with the [...] cannon. [...] On 20 March the French government declared that they could not process the sale, and on 12 April the process to acquire these vehicles began anew.|$|E

50|$|Executive Order No. 20, Series of 2001 {{effectively}} {{elevated the}} {{chairperson of the}} HUDCC as a cabinet official, with the officeholder holding the rank of Secretary, subject to {{the approval of the}} Commission on Appointments. However, since the administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, it has been designated as the cabinet portfolio of the Vice President of the Philippines, thus needing no <b>confirmation</b> by the <b>Commission</b> on Appointment as stipulated by the Philippine Constitution.|$|R

For three consecutive terms after the {{ratification of the}} constitution, one-half of the seats allocated to party-list representatives were filled [...] "by selection or election."

50|$|Benigno Aquino III was Secretary of Interior and Local Government, until Aquino named Robredo {{to succeed}} him.

In March 2012, the Commission on Appointments bypassed Robredo's nomination. His nomination was bypassed again in June 2012. Another confirmation hearing had reportedly been set on August 29, 2012, eleven days after Robredo's sudden death.|$|R
50|$|Henderson {{was wounded}} at the Battle of Resaca during the Atlanta campaign. He {{returned}} {{to lead his}} regiment during the Carolinas Campaign. General Joseph E. Johnston witnessed Henderson leading a desperate charge at the Battle of Bentonville, North Carolina, March 19-21, 1865. His brigade's charge helped restore a crumbling Confederate flank. Johnston proceeded to promote Henderson to brigadier general, or more likely to acting brigadier general, because Johnston had no authority to promote officers to general officer rank. On the other hand, the Confederate civilian authorities were in disarray and the Confederate Senate had already met {{for the last time}} so Henderson was unlikely to receive an official appointment, <b>confirmation</b> and <b>commission</b> and he was never legally commissioned. Henderson led the brigade as part of Carter L. Stevenson's Division of the II Corps of the Army of Tennessee until the surrender of Johnston's army at Bennett Place near Durham, North Carolina on April 26, 1865.|$|R
5|$|Like {{his father}} before him, Alec Waugh {{went to school}} at Sherborne, and, it was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Alec to leave, after a {{homosexual}} relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting <b>confirmation</b> of his <b>commission,</b> wrote The Loom of Youth (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, {{he was sent to}} Lancing College, in his opinion, a decidedly inferior school.|$|R
25|$|The {{power to}} appoint the Chief Justice {{lies with the}} President, who makes the {{selection}} {{from a list of}} three nominees prepared by the Judicial and Bar Council. There is no material difference in the process of selecting a Chief Justice from that in the selection of Associate Justices. As with the other Justices of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice is obliged to retire upon reaching the age of 70, otherwise there is no term limit for the Chief Justice. In the 1935 constitution, any person appointed by the president has to be confirmed by the Commission on Appointments; in the 1973 constitution, the person whom the president has appointed won't have to go <b>confirmation</b> under the <b>Commission</b> on Appointments.|$|R

50|$|Ruiz began a long {{military}} career in 1811, joining the Bexar Provincial Militia with {{the rank of}} lieutenant. He joined the Republican Army at Bexar and took part in failed revolution from Spain in 1813, fighting {{at the battle of}} Medina on August 18. Forced into exile from Texas until 1822, Ruiz returned after Mexico won its independence from Spain. He was ordered by the Mexican government to make attempts at peace with the hostile Native American tribes of the North, the Comanches and the Lipans. Appointed to the mounted militia upon his return, he successfully led a peace treaty delegation of Lipans to Mexico City later in 1822. The next year, Ruiz received a promotion to army captain, unassigned, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, receiving <b>confirmation</b> of his <b>commission</b> in 1825.
