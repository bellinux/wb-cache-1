40|$|The present work {{presents}} {{some results}} about the <b>categorial</b> <b>relation</b> between logics and its categories of structures. A (propositional, finitary) logic {{is a pair}} given by a signature and Tarskian consequence relation on its formula algebra. The logics are the objects in our categories of logics; the morphisms are certain signature morphisms that are translations between logics (AFLM 1,AFLM 2,AFLM 3 FC). Morphisms between algebraizable logics (BP) are translations that preserves algebraizing pairs (MaMe) : they can be completely encoded by certain functors defined on the quasi-variety canonically associated to the algebraizable logics. This kind of results will be useful {{in the development of}} a categorial approach to the representation theory of general logics (MaPi 1, MaPi 2, AJMP).

40|$|Images, or icons, {{have been}} made {{the subject of a}} ‘turn’. But no new epoch under its sign is looming. The image is just one medium among others. The best we can do is to face what it may and what it may not achieve. Its main {{competitor}} is the word – though there is a field of transition between both. Words and numbers surpass the image when one needs to refer to something that cannot be seen – this holds for ‘radioactivity’ just as much as for ‘responsibility’. To unambiguously show a <b>categorial</b> <b>relation</b> like causality or a logical feature like negation in an image borders on the impossible. (The aspiration to symbolize or manifest the invisible, though, has long inspired artistic images.) Pictures are accessible to the illiterate; while a language must be learned, an image seems to admit everyone. Yet that is in part an illusion. Obviously, {{it is not enough to}} see an image. To understand it, however, often a number of things must have been learnt in the first place, too...|$|E
40|$|Applications {{currently}} {{make use}} of many kinds of lex-ical information: <b>categorial</b> <b>relations</b> ("dog " is-a "ca-nine"), synonymy ("pooch " same-as "dog") and word associations ("walk " occurs-often-with "dog"). How-ever, an important type of information, differentia, is often omitted, especially in broad-coverage applica-tions. Differentia are properties that distinguish a con-cept from others belonging to the same higher-level cat-egory. For instance, both beagles and wolfhounds are hounds, but the former are small, whereas the latter are quite large. Applications should incorporate differentia to provide finer word-sense distinctions and to facilitate inference of information {{not mentioned in the}} text. Determining the differentia is a difficult task, since the available knowledge sources define these propertie...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we aim {{to analyse}} {{derivation}} by means of în- 1 (îm- 1), respectively a- 1 prefixes in old Romanian literary langua ge in terms of derivational morphology. Thus, we shall {{take into consideration the}} description of the delocutive derivation process that was widespread in the old age of Romanian literary language – influenced by Slavic language – in terms of the ‘conventi onal vocabulary’, made up by means of a set of morphological and semantic rules that influence the word formation process. Our attempt aims at organising în-, a- derivatives depending on the specialised <b>categorial</b> <b>relations</b> between the affix and the radic al/base in order to emphasise the importance of this internal means of vocabulary enrichment as early as the first stages of the literary language...|$|R
40|$|This paper, which {{falls into}} the field of derivational morphology, aims to analyse, from the logico-semantic viewpoint, the verbs derived with în– (îm–), excerpted from old Romanian texts. Starting from the {{assumption}} that, regardless of the stages of an idiom, there are sufficient means to render some aspects that have to do, in principle, with the internal lexical creativity of that particular language, {{it is interesting to}} emphasize the way in which ‘the change of state’ is reflected in old Romanian literary texts. The analysis grids include the semantic and morphological principles—adapted to our working material which consists of a corpus of religious and laic texts from the 16 th– 18 th centuries. Our approach has focused on various possibilities of expressing the ‘transformation’ materialized in the evolutional-dynamic process, taking into account the <b>categorial</b> <b>relations</b> between în– and the bases to which it is attached, and the conceptual values imposed by the mentioned affix on the derived term...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{develop a}} {{calculus}} of surgery data, called bridged links, which involves besides links also pairs of balls that describe one-handle attachements. As {{opposed to the}} usual link calculi of Kirby and others this description uses only elementary, local moves(namely modifications and isolated cancellations), and it is valid also on non-simply connected and disconnected manifolds. In particular, {{it allows us to}} give a presentation of a 3 -manifold by doing surgery on any other 3 -manifold with the same boundary. Bridged link presentations on unions of handlebodies are used to give a Cerf-theoretical derivation of presentations of 2 + 1 -dimensional cobordisms categories in terms of planar ribbon tangles and their composition rules. As an application we give a different, more natural proof of the Matveev-Polyak presentations of the mapping class group, and, furthermore, find systematically surgery presentations of general mapping tori. We discuss a natural extension of the Reshetikhin Turaev invariant to the calculus of bridged links. Invariance follows now- similar as for knot invariants- from simple identifications of the elementary moves with elementary <b>categorial</b> <b>relations</b> for invariances or cointegrals, respectively. Hence, we avoid the lengthy computations and the unnatural Fenn-Rourke reduction of the origina...|$|R

Moreover, we are able to start from a much weaker ``modularity''-condition, which implies the one of Turaev. Generalizations of the presentation to cobordisms of surfaces with boundaries are outlined. Comment: To appear in "Advances in Mathematics" (75 pages, 54 figures) see [URL]...|$|R
40|$|After a brief {{introduction}} to <b>categorial</b> grammar in <b>relation</b> to basic sentence structure, subject-verb agreement is implemented within the formalism with predicate-logical types. The apparatus is then applied {{to an analysis}} of clitics in terms of lifting. Phenomena such as clitic doubling and subject pro drop are treated in the general formalism of categorial logic. The clause-locality of cliticisation is captured by reference to temporally intensional domains in relation to which cliticclimbing over infinitival verbs is characterised...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a method for}} extracting biological relations (in the first place, relations used in the KEGG ontology of biological pathways) from scientific texts. The main assumption is that correct syntactic analysis combined with domain-specific heuristics provides a good basis for relation extraction. We propose an algorithm that searches through the syntactic trees produced by a parser based on a formalism called Referent Grammar (inspired by <b>Categorial</b> Grammar), identifies <b>relations</b> mentioned in the sentence, and classifies them {{with respect to their}} semantic class and epistemic status (facts, counterfactuals, hypotheses).
