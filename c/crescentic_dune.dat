5000|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} experimental measurements on aeolian sand movement were performed by Ralph Alger Bagnold, a British engineer who worked in Egypt prior to World War II. Bagnold investigated the physics of particles moving through the atmosphere and deposited by wind. He recognized two basic dune types, the <b>crescentic</b> <b>dune,</b> which he called [...] "barchan," [...] and the linear dune, which he called longitudinal or [...] "seif" [...] (Arabic for [...] "sword").|$|E
50|$|All these dune shapes {{may occur}} in three forms: simple, compound, and complex. Simple dunes are basic forms {{with a minimum}} number of slipfaces that define the {{geometric}} type. Compound dunes are large dunes on which smaller dunes of similar type and slipface orientation are superimposed, and complex dunes are combinations {{of two or more}} dune types. A <b>crescentic</b> <b>dune</b> with a star dune superimposed on its crest is the most common complex dune. Simple dunes represent a wind regime that has not changed in intensity or direction since the formation of the dune, while compound and complex dunes suggest that the intensity and direction of the wind has changed.|$|E
50|$|The Gran Desierto is {{best known}} for its {{magnificent}} Star Dunes, many in excess of 100 m high. More than two-thirds of the Gran Desierto is covered by sand sheets and sand streaks. The remaining area is split equally between a western population of star dunes and an eastern set of transverse or <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes.</b> Some of the larger <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes</b> in the northeastern sand sea exhibit reversing crests, a transitional morphologic feature associated with star dunes.|$|R
50|$|Crescent-shaped mounds are {{generally}} wider {{than they are}} long. The slipfaces are on the concave sides of the dunes. These dunes form under winds that blow consistently from one direction, and they also are known as barchans, or transverse dunes. Some types of <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes</b> move more quickly over desert surfaces than {{any other type of}} dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100 metres per year between 1954 and 1959 in China's Ningxia Province, and similar speeds have been recorded in the Western Desert of Egypt. The largest <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes</b> on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than three kilometres, are in China's Taklamakan Desert.|$|R

In another region known as Rock Garden, Sojourner encountered crescent moon-shaped dunes, which are similar to <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes</b> on Earth.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of Martian and terrestrial dunes was made based on Viking Orbiter pictures and aerial pictures of terrestrial deserts. The morphological similarity between the Martian <b>dunes</b> and terrestrial <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes</b> implies that the dynamics of dune formation are similar on the two planets, despite Martian constraints on dune formation that include much higher velocity winds required to move 'sand' in saltation, the possible inhibition of sand movement by absorbed water vapor, the seasonal 'snow' cover in the north circumpolar erg, and a probably sparse sand supply. The absence of longitudinal dunes and the restriction of massive <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes</b> to a few sites on Mars suggests that Mars may have a long eolian history in which much of the sand suitable for saltation has already been transported to the north polar erg and crater floor fields...|$|R

50|$|Fixed <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes</b> {{that form}} on the leeward margins of playas and river valleys in arid and {{semiarid}} regions {{in response to the}} direction(s) of prevailing winds, are known as lunettes, source-bordering dunes, bourrelets and clay dunes. They may be composed of clay, silt, sand, or gypsum, eroded from the basin floor or shore, transported up the concave side of the dune, and deposited on the convex side. Examples in Australia are up to 6.5 km long, 1 km wide, and up to 50 metres high. They also occur in southern and West Africa, and in parts of the western United States, especially Texas.|$|R
40|$|The Algodones Dune Field {{of southeastern}} California shows {{a complex and}} {{spatially}} diverse dune-field pattern that is superimposed upon a series of topographic lineations. Analysis of dune-field pattern parameters (dune crest length, crest orientation, dune spacing and defect density) derived from aerial images indicates that the dune-field pattern represents two constructional generations. Prominent compound <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes</b> formed during the first constructional generation. A younger generation consists {{of a variety of}} simple <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes,</b> linear dunes and zibars. Statistical differences in the pattern parameters between the dune groups within the second generation are resolved through consideration of the boundary conditions under which the dune pattern evolved, and provide explanations for: (1) diversity of dune types, (2) range in implied constructional times, (3) range in crest orientations, and (4) the anomalous nature of the population of linear dunes. The boundary conditions that have modified pattern development include orographic effects, grain size, vegetation, areal extent and antecedent conditions. Topographic lineations in the Algodones range from the Western Ramp, which defines the field margin, to subtle features masked by the pattern of dunes. Imaging of the Western Ramp using Ground Penetrating Radar shows high-angle cross-strata migrating perpendicular to the lineation trend. The most plausible hypothesis for the origin of the lineations is as dune ridges sequentially shed from adjacent Lake Cahuilla, which is the source of Algodones sands. The overall geomorphic complexity of the Algodones originates from the emplacement of the dune ridges during stages of Lake Cahuilla, the two generations of dune-field construction, and the controls exerted by boundary conditions...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} better the polygenetic evolution of landforms on the martian surface, field studies were conducted {{in and around the}} Kharga Depression, Egypt. The Kharga region, on the eastern edge of Egypt's Western Desert, was subject to erosion under mostly hyperarid climatic conditions, punctuated by brief pluvial episodes of lesser aridity, since early Pleistocene time. The region contains numerous landforms analogous to features on the martian surface: yardangs carved in layered surficial deposits and in bedrock, invasive dune trains, wind-modified channels and interfluves, and depressions bounded by steep scarps. Like many of the topographic depresions on Mars, the Kharga Depression was invaded by <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes.</b> In Egypt, stratigraphic relations between dunes, yardangs, mass-wasting debris, and wind-eroded flash-flood deposits record shifts in the relative effectiveness of wind, water, and mass-wasting processes as a function of climate change...|$|R

The sizes of the dunefields range from 40 to 3600 sq km and vary directly with crater size. Preliminary studies reveal dunefields of two varieties. The most common type is composed of massed straight to slightly wavy <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes</b> similar to those described by Breed. Dunefields of this type occupy more than 20 % of {{the area of the}} crater floor, with the dunefield margins often marked by a large dune wall or rampart. Dune spacing ranges between 0. 7 and 1. 2 km. The second type of dune accumulation consists of clusters of large, widely spaced straight or curved ridges, which often intersect to create rectilinear patterns. Dunes are typically spaced 1. 6 to 4 km apart. Earth terrestrial analogs for these dunes are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Barchans are <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes</b> {{propagating}} on a solid ground. They form dune {{fields in}} the shape of elongated corridors in which the size and spacing between dunes are rather well selected. We show that even very realistic models for solitary dunes do not reproduce these corridors. Instead, two instabilities take place. First, barchans receive a sand flux at their back proportional to their width while the sand escapes only from their horns. Large dunes proportionally capture more than they loose sand, while the situation is reversed for small ones: therefore, solitary dunes cannot remain in a steady state. Second, the propagation speed of dunes decreases with the size of the dune: this leads [...] through the collision process [...] to a coarsening of barchan fields. We show that these phenomena are not specific to the model, but result from general and robust mechanisms. The length scales needed for these instabilities to develop are derived and discussed. They turn out to be much smaller than the dune field length. As a conclusion, there should exist further - yet unknown - mechanisms regulating and selecting the size of dunes.

The present paper {{reports the}} formation of subaqueous barchan dunes from initially conical heaps in a rectangular channel. Because the most unique feature of a barchan dune is its horns, we associate the timescale for the appearance of horns to {{the formation of}} a barchan dune. A granular heap initially conical was placed on the bottom wall of a closed conduit and it was entrained by a water flow in turbulent regime. After a certain time, horns appear and grow, until an equilibrium length is reached. Our results show the existence of the timescales $ 0. 5 t_c$ and $ 2. 5 t_c$ for the appearance and equilibrium of horns, respectively, where $t_c$ is a characteristic time that scales with the grains diameter, gravity acceleration, densities of the fluid and grains, and shear and threshold velocities.

5000|$|Ergs are {{concentrated}} in two broad belts between 20° to 40°N and 20° to 40°S latitudes, which include regions crossed by the dry, subsiding air of the trade winds. Active ergs are limited to regions that receive, on average, no more than 150 mm of annual precipitation. The largest are in northern and southern Africa, central and western Asia, and Central Australia. In South America, ergs are limited by the Andes Mountains, but they do contain extremely large dunes in coastal Peru and northwestern Argentina. They are also found in several parts of the northeast coast of Brazil. The only active erg in North America is in the Gran Desierto de Altar (...) that extends from the Sonoran Desert in the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora to the Yuma Desert of Arizona and the Algodones Dunes of southeastern California. An erg that has been fixed by vegetation forms the Nebraska Sandhills (...) [...]Sand seas and dune fields generally occur in regions downwind of copious sources of dry, loose sand, such as dry riverbeds and deltas, floodplains, glacial outwash plains, dry lakes, and beaches. Almost all major ergs are located downwind from river beds {{in areas that are}} too dry to support extensive vegetative cover and are thus subject to long-continued wind erosion. Sand from these abundant sources migrates downwind and builds up into very large dunes where its movement is halted or slowed by topographic barriers to windflow or by convergence of windflow. Entire ergs and dune fields tend to migrate downwind as far as hundreds of kilometers from their sources of sand. Such accumulation requires long periods of time. At least one million years are required to build ergs with very large dunes, such as those on the Arabian Peninsula, in North Africa, and in central Asia. Sand seas that have accumulated in subsiding structural and topographic basins, such as the Murzuk Sand Sea (...) of Libya, may attain great thicknesses (more than 1000 m) but others, such as the ergs of linear dunes in the Simpson Desert (...) and Great Sandy Desert (...) of Australia, may be no thicker than the individual dunes superposed on the alluvial plain. Within sand seas in a given area, the dunes tend to be of a single type. For example, there are ergs or fields of linear <b>dunes,</b> of <b>crescentic</b> <b>dunes,</b> of star dunes, and of parabolic dunes, and these dune arrays tend to have consistent orientations and sizes.|$|R
40|$|The {{preserved}} {{deposits of}} dune-scale aeolian bedforms provide valuable palaeoenvironmental indicators of atmospheric circulation patterns and the latitudinal position {{and distribution of}} land masses. However, no attempts to use palaeowind directions and palaeogeographic reconstructions of ancient land mass distribution have been published to model Precambrian atmospheric circulation. The Mangabeira Formation is a large Mesoproterozoic aeolian erg succession (1. 6 to 1. 5 Ga) composed of two aeolian units that accumulated in the São Francisco Craton, Brazil. The Lower Unit records multiple drying-upward depositional cycles, each of which represents an episode of erg expansion and contraction driven by climate changes. The Upper Unit is composed dominantly of stacked aeolian dune strata that lack intervening interdune deposits and which record extreme aridity. Palaeowind directions recorded from cross-strata of transverse, <b>crescentic</b> aeolian <b>dunes</b> of the Lower and Upper Units record dune migration {{under the influence of}} two dominant winds that blew to the southeast and northwest. Analysis of these palaeowind data in relation to assessment of regional palaeogeographic reconstructions for the period 1. 6 to 1. 5 Ga reveals a correlation between atmospheric circulation and land mass distribution. At this time the São Francisco Craton was located between the mid-latitudes and the equatorial zone. The wind regime determined from analysis of dip azimuths of cross-strata of the Lower Unit (1. 6 to 1. 54 Ga) are consistent with a palaeogeographic position between 25 ° to 35 ° S. Analysis of cross-strata dip azimuths of the Upper Unit indicate northwest-directed palaeowinds and a dominant monsoonal wind pattern from 1. 54 to 1. 5 Ga. During this time the large land mass of the São-Francisco-Congo and Siberian cratons drifted northwards through the equatorial zone from palaeolatitude 30 ° S to 30 °N...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The Hopeman Sandstone, {{which is}} exposed at the {{southern}} edge of the Moray Firth Basin, is composed of a number of aeolian sandstone u its. These units, which have been mapped continuously for 4. 5 km, represent part of an ancient sand sea in which complex star dunes alternated with sand-filled star-dune corridors. The palaeowind regime was complex with prevailing winds from the NNE, secondary winds from the SSE and subordinate winds from the NW. The complex star dunes are represented by two types of deposits: Type I [...] large-scale or giant-scale mainly trough-formed high- to medium-angle cross-bedding, which constitute the slip-face deposits of actively migrating star dunes; and Type II [...] bimodaUy dipping more wedge-shaped large-scale or giant-scale sets, which apparently formed on the opposed flanks of relatively stationary star arm segments. The exposed star arms trend in three main directions being roughly parallel with the palaeowind directions. The dune-dune corridors contain small- and medium-sized <b>crescentic</b> or reversing <b>dunes</b> which frequently overlap the star-dune flanks, interdune flats, and rare ephemeral streams.

40|$|This Sheet Description {{describes}} the Quaternary and solid geology of the Umm Azzimul 1 : 100 000 scale geological map. The Umm Azzimul district covers approximately 2700 km 2 {{in the far}} southeast of the UAE {{along the border with}} Saudi Arabia and Oman. This district spans the transition from the extensive sand sea of the Ramlat ar Rabbad in the northwest to the distal alluvial fan sediments and Miocene limestone outcrops along the border with Oman around Al Manadir and Umm Azzimul, and includes the eastern extension of the Liwa megabarchan field. The oldest rocks in the area are the Miocene Dam Formation limestones and dolomites that form flat or very gently sloping limestone pavements within the interdunes in the far southeast of the district. In the northeast, these are partially overlain by the fluvial sands and gravels of the Hili Formation. These fluvial gravels represent the very distal end of a large alluvial fan system that extends out from the Hajar Mountains. The lithological composition of these gravels reflects their source area in the Hamrat Duru region of Oman, rather than the ophiolite source seen further north. These alluvial fans peter out in a series of continental sabkhas underlain by both fluvial and aeolian sands. The major part of the Umm Azzimul district consists of aeolian dunes of various morphologies. The dune morphology changes systematically in a south and south-easterly direction across the district, reflecting the migration of the dunes driven by the prevailing wind. In the northwest, the extensive Ramlat ar Rabbad sand sea is comprised of large barchan dunes that get progressively smaller to the south and east. Across {{the central part of the}} district, these morph into more discrete megabarchan dunes and dune ridges separated by flat interdune sabkhas. Much of the south-western part of the sheet is occupied by large <b>crescentic</b> megabarchan <b>dunes</b> up to 130 m high that extend west into the Liwa area, whilst in the east, the elongate linear dune ridges, punctuated by numerous star dunes and occasional megabarchans are more common. The star dunes become more frequent close to the Oman border. These dune ridges and star dunes can rise up to 100 m above the surrounding interdunes. Most of the district is sparely populated, with no major urban areas and few roads. The south of the region is also host to the relatively small Qusawira and Mender oilfields...|$|R
