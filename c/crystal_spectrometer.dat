40|$|During {{the last}} decades high–precision {{spectroscopy}} of exotic–atom X–rays profited in particular {{in the case of}} pions from the increasing number of stopped particles provided by the cyclotron trap at the accelerator facility of the Paul–Scherrer–Institut (PSI) together with modern detector concepts like charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrometers.</b> Presently, priority is given {{to the study of the}} strong–interaction effects in the most elementary system – pionic hydrogen. However, the systems with two or more nucleons are as fundamental for the development of a theoretical description of hadronic matter. Furthermore, the de–excitation of exotic atoms involves a variety of atomic processes, which become accessible in detail due to the high resolution achievable with <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrometers,</b> e. g., parallel transitions, line splittings, broadenings and intensity distributions. In addition, first successful attempts for a microscopic description of the atomic cascade are available now, which should be subject to stringent tests both for atoms and molecules. ...|$|R

It was lost on 14 December 2001 due to battery failure but revolutionised X-ray observations in its decade of operations. Yohkoh (or Sunbeam) orbited the Earth in an elliptical orbit, observing X-ray and γ-ray emissions from solar phenomena such as solar flares. Yohkoh carried four instruments. The Bragg <b>Crystal</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (BCS), the Wide Band Spectrometer (WBS), the Soft X-Ray Telescope (SXT) and the Hard X-Ray Telescope (HXT) were operated by a consortium of scientists from Japan, the USA and the UK.

5000|$|With his {{background}} in X-ray diffraction, Wollan {{was one of}} the first to recognize the potential value of neutrons for investigating the structure of materials. In May 1944 he asked the director of Clinton Laboratories (now Oak Ridge National Laboratory) for permission to use the neutron output of the X-10 reactor to study the diffraction of neutrons in single crystals. His request was granted, and a neutron <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrometer</b> that Wollan brought from Chicago was installed in the reactor that same month to make observations on a crystal of gypsum. Wollan and his group were transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to the Clinton Laboratories in August of that year.

That same year, Course XXII was upgraded to a full MIT academic department (previously it was a program under Chemical Engineering), Norm as invited by Manson Benedict {{to be one of}} the new department's founding assistant professors. Rasmussen was a key user of the new reactor, and participated in constructing a 6-meter bent <b>crystal</b> <b>spectrometer</b> used for gamma ray spectroscopy studies for many years. He migrated from determination of decay spectra to the use of spectra for measuring nuclear composition. This led him to a major program for the measurement of spent nuclear fuel composition, a matter of significant importance to the nuclear weapons programs where both tritium and plutonium were created in production reactors. the International Atomic Energy Agency adopted his techniques for use in proliferation studies.|$|E
