40|$|Abstract: <b>Catalysts</b> are {{important}} to the chemical industry and environmental remediation due to their effective conversion of one chemical into another. Among them, composite <b>catalysts</b> have attracted continuous attention during the past decades. Nowadays, composite <b>catalysts</b> are being used more and more to meet the practical catalytic performance requirements in the chemical industry of high activity, high selectivity and good stability. In this paper, we reviewed our recent work on development of composite <b>catalysts,</b> mainly focusing on the composite <b>catalysts</b> obtained from porous materials such as zeolites, mesoporous materials, carbon nanotubes (CNT), etc. Six types of porous composite <b>catalysts</b> are discussed, including amorphous oxide modified zeolite composite <b>catalysts,</b> zeolite composites prepared by co-crystallization or overgrowth, hierarchical porous <b>catalysts,</b> host-guest porous composites, inorganic and organic mesoporous composite <b>catalysts,</b> and polymer/CNT composite <b>catalysts...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is as a <b>catalyst</b> in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been {{employed as a}} <b>catalyst</b> since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a <b>catalyst</b> {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' <b>catalyst,</b> is used as a hydrogenation <b>catalyst,</b> specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a <b>catalyst</b> for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E

The traditional, industrial <b>catalysts</b> are ill-defined and used mainly for Petroleum products. Modern <b>catalysts</b> are well-defined organometallic compounds that come in two main categories, commonly known as Schrock <b>catalysts</b> and Grubbs' <b>catalysts.</b> Schrock <b>catalysts</b> are molybdenum(IV)- and tungsten(IV)-based, and are examples of Schrock alkylidenes.|$|R

The molecular dispersion of active sites in these materials limits the application of conventional spectroscopic techniques utilized for the characterization of heterogeneous <b>catalysts.</b> The X-ray absorption spectroscopy is the most suitable tool to characterize the molecular species present in these <b>catalysts</b> because this technique is sensitive to short-range structural orders, element-specific and amenable to in slits studies.

5|$|Because both {{methanol}} {{and carbon}} monoxide are commodity raw materials, methanol carbonylation long {{appeared to be}} attractive precursors to acetic acid. Henri Dreyfus at British Celanese developed a methanol carbonylation pilot plant as early as 1925. However, a lack of practical materials that could contain the corrosive reaction mixture at the high pressures needed (200 atm or more) discouraged commercialization of these routes. The first commercial methanol carbonylation process, which used a cobalt <b>catalyst,</b> was developed by German chemical company BASF in 1963. In 1968, a rhodium-based <b>catalyst</b> (cis−−) was discovered that could operate efficiently at lower pressure with almost no by-products. US chemical company Monsanto Company built the first plant using this <b>catalyst</b> in 1970, and rhodium-catalyzed methanol carbonylation became the dominant method of acetic acid production (see Monsanto process). In the late 1990s, the chemicals company BP Chemicals commercialised the Cativa <b>catalyst</b> (−), which is promoted by iridium for greater efficiency. This iridium-catalyzed Cativa process is greener and more efficient and has largely supplanted the Monsanto process, often in the same production plants.|$|E

The olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as <b>catalyst.</b> Normally Re2O7 on alumina is used for this process. Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.|$|E
30|$|Two {{types of}} {{carbon-based}} cathode <b>catalysts</b> were synthesized from FePc/PhRs and HB-FePc precursors, and characterized by electrochemical measurements, TG-DTA, XRD, and HXPES. The HB-FePc <b>catalysts</b> retained their ORR activity at high temperatures up to 900 °C. TG-DTA and XRD {{results showed that}} the HB-FePc <b>catalysts</b> have a linked structure and high thermostability at these high temperatures. From the HXPES analysis, the FWHMs of the C 1 s peaks of the FePc/PhRs <b>catalysts</b> exhibited a large increase (0.2 eV) at 600 °C and then decreased above 600 °C, possibly because of thermal decomposition of FePc macrocycles and subsequent graphitization. In contrast, that of the HB-FePc <b>catalysts</b> showed a negligible (0.02 eV) increase, so decomposition was suppressed by the biphenyl linker. In addition, the nitrogen content of the HB-FePc <b>catalysts</b> was higher than that of the FePc/PhRs <b>catalysts</b> between 600 °C to 800 °C. The retention of the ORR activity of the HB-FePc <b>catalysts</b> above 800 °C {{may be related to the}} graphitization of the HB-FePc <b>catalysts</b> containing ORR-active nitrogen [38]. The unique active site formation mechanism in the HB-FePc <b>catalysts</b> provides a possibility to synthesize carbon-based cathode <b>catalysts</b> with improved ORR activity at high pyrolysis temperatures.|$|R
