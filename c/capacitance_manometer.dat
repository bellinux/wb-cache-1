A variation on this idea is the <b>capacitance</b> <b>manometer,</b> in which the diaphragm makes up a part of a capacitor. A change in pressure leads to the flexure of the diaphragm, which results in a change in capacitance. These gauges are effective from 103 torr to 10−4 torr, and beyond.|$|E

The crystal holder is usually heated from the backside to temperatures of 500 to 700°C. Most setups also have RHEED equipment for the in-situ monitoring of surface superstructures on the growing surface and for measuring growth rates, and mass spectrometers for the analysis of the molecular species in the beams and the analysis of the residual gases.The gas inlet system, {{which is one of the}} most important components of the system, controls the material beam flux. Pressure controlled systems are used most commonly. The material flux is controlled by the input pressure of the gas injection capillary. The pressure inside the chamber can be measured and controlled by a <b>capacitance</b> <b>manometer.</b> The molecular beams of gaseous source materials injectors or effusion jets that ensure a homogeneous beam profile. For some starting compounds, such as the hydrides that are the group V starting material, the hydrides have to be precracked into the injector.

40|$|<b>Capacitance</b> <b>manometer</b> with sensors {{maintained}} at temperatures above {{the temperature of}} the vacuum vessel may read a higher gas pressure than the true value. This arises due to a transport process of molecules induced by molecule-surface collisions called thermal transpiration effect. Thermal transpiration effect depends on the pressure, the temperature gradient, gas, geometry and surface properties of the interconnecting pipe between the <b>capacitance</b> <b>manometer</b> and the vacuum vessel. To determine the height of the thermal transpiration effect for the biomolecular gas tetrahydrofuran, an experimental setup has been built. Its suitability to measure the thermal transpiration effect has been tested. Measurements of thermal transpiration effects for nitrogen and tetrahydrofuran have been analyzed with the semi-empirical Takaishi-Sensui equation. The coefficients of the Takaishi-Sensui equation can be used to determine the magnitude of the thermal transpiration effect for different temperature gradients, diameters of the interconnecting pipe and pressures...|$|E
40|$|Interpretation of {{planetary}} observations and proper modeling {{of planetary}} atmospheres are critically upon accurate laboratory {{data for the}} chemical and physical properties of the constitutes of the atmospheres. It is important that these data are taken over the appropriate range of parameters such as temperature, pressure, and composition. Availability of accurate, laboratory data for vapor pressures and equilibrium constants of condensed species at low temperatures is essential for photochemical and cloud models of the atmospheres of the outer planets. In {{the absence of such}} data, modelers {{have no choice but to}} assume values based on an educated guess. In those cases where higher temperature data are available, a standard procedure is to extrapolate these points to the lower temperatures using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Last summer the vapor pressures of acetylene (C 2 H 2) hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and cyanoacetylene (HC 3 N) was measured using two different methods. At the higher temperatures 1 torr and 10 torr <b>capacitance</b> <b>manometers</b> were used. To measure very low pressures, a technique was used which is based on the infrared absorption of thin film (TFIR). This summer the vapor pressure of acetylene was measured the TFIR method. The vapor pressure of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) was measured using <b>capacitance</b> <b>manometers.</b> Results for H 2 O agree with literature data over the common range of temperature. At the lower temperatures the data lie slightly below the values predicted by extrapolation of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Thin film infrared (TFIR) data for acetylene lie significantly below the values predicted by extrapolation.

5000|$|Aneroid gauges {{are based}} on a {{metallic}} pressure-sensing element that flexes elastically under the effect of a pressure difference across the element. [...] "Aneroid" [...] means [...] "without fluid," [...] and the term originally distinguished these gauges from the hydrostatic gauges described above. However, aneroid gauges can be used to measure the pressure of a liquid as well as a gas, and they are not the only type of gauge that can operate without fluid. For this reason, they are often called mechanical gauges in modern language. Aneroid gauges are not dependent on the type of gas being measured, unlike thermal and ionization gauges, and are less likely to contaminate the system than hydrostatic gauges. The pressure sensing element may be a Bourdon tube, a diaphragm, a capsule, or a set of bellows, which will change shape in response to the pressure of the region in question. The deflection of the pressure sensing element may be read by a linkage connected to a needle, or it may be read by a secondary transducer. The most common secondary transducers in modern vacuum gauges measure a change in capacitance due to the mechanical deflection. Gauges that rely on a change in capacitance are often referred to as <b>capacitance</b> <b>manometers.</b>|$|R

Pure water vapour was measured at ambient temperature with a Bruker IFS 120 HR at a spectral resolution of 0. 0027 cm- 1, pressures ranging from 0. 2 to 5 hPa, and absorption paths from 0. 25 to 80 m. In case of the short cell measurements (0. 25 m absorption path) high resolution reference measurements were taken while for the White cell measurements (20 and 80 m) low resolution reference spectra were sufficient. The White cell required a continuous flow of water while for the short cell static filling with a gas reservoir attached was sufficient. Pressures were measured with <b>capacitance</b> <b>manometers</b> for number density determination. Spectra were corrected for non-linearity and thermal self emission. Spectral calibration was performed by means of N 2 O measurements with NIST heterodyne line positions as reference. The field stop diameter was fitted from N 2 O and water lines. In total nine spectra were analyzed. Self broadening was obtained from measurements at 1 and 5 hPa. Merged pressure broadening data were then used as input for line position and linestrength determination of all data sets. Linestrengths with reasonable uncertainties (< 10 %) were obtained for 2 x 10 - 25 < S < 1 x 10 - 19.

The vapor pressure was measured for all systems mentioned above (both as pure components and corresponding mixtures) as a function of temperature and composition. The temperature range used in each case varied from approximately 10 k above the triple point temperature of each species to a temperature corresponding to a pressure of about 200 kPa on the saturation curve. As regards composition, a variable number of mixtures were prepared in accordance with the available amount of each component and the magnitude of the isotope effects.

In particular, acetylene (C 2 H 2) has been identified at Jupiter, Saturn and its satellite Titan, Uranus and Neptune. In the lower atmospheres of these planets, where colder temperatures prevail, the condensation and/or freezing of acetylene is probable. In order to obtain accurate models of the acetylene in these atmospheres, it is necessary to have a complete understanding of its vapor pressures at low temperatures. Vapor pressures at low temperatures for acetylene are being determined. The vapor pressures are measured with two different techniques in order to cover a wide range of temperatures and pressures.

Gradients in cases of interatrial septal defect {{are similar to those}} foundin animals with artificially produced defects. The data are used to form a rounded picture of thehemodynamics of interatrial septal defect. In pulmonic stenosis with interatrial communication, reversal of the usual left-to-right gradient may occur only during atrial systole. Under these circum-stances it is often possible to distinguish a patent foramen ovale with competent valve from aninteratrial septal defect. ATRIAL hemodynamics have been ex-tensively studied in animals'- 7 with or without interatrial communications. Despite the widespread use of right heart catheterization, there is still a paucity of such information in man. During routine right heart catheterization of several patients with congenital heart disease, passage of the catheter through inter-atrial communications made it possible to record pressure pulses from both atria. An analysis of these curves, insofar as it provides information on atrial hemodynamics in man, forms the basis of this report. METHODS The data consisted of atrial pressure pulses from 14 cases with congenital interatrial communications. Seven of these sets of curves were unsuitable for detailed analysis because of artefacts or large re-spiratory variations. However, the data from these discarded cases lend themselves to the same inter-pretation as the seven analyzed in detail. The atrial pressure curves were recorded from each atrium in quick succession, using the Sanborn <b>capacitance</b> <b>manometer</b> (fig. 1). A simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram (lead II) served as a time reference. The patients were supine and breath-ing quietly. The zero level was 5 cm. dorsad to the angle of Louis. Blood samples were obtained in each case from both atria. The presence and magnitude of right-to-left shunting of blood in the atria wer...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the freeze-drying process is to deliver a consistently stable, efficacious, easily reconstitutable, and non-immunogenic final product to the patient at an affordable cost. However, heterogeneity in the heat transfer to vials across the batch and in mass transfer resistance to sublimation were found to lead to variation in the factors affecting product quality both intra- and inter-batch. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to identify and quantify the sources of variation in the freeze-drying process, which alter the thermal history of the product and investigate their effects on the product quality attributes. Effects of processing parameters on the measurement of vial heat transfer coefficient (Kv), one of the major factors affecting the product temperature and drying time, were studied. This study found several nuances and pitfalls of Kv measurement. Calculation of Kv for developing a cycle for a new product should be based on measurements made at target shelf temperatures and chamber pressures, using the vial and fill volume of the new product. Experimentally obtained distribution in Kv across a batch of vials was combined with variations in three other input parameters – dry product layer resistance, fill volume and shelf temperature – in a first principles based, steady-state heat and mass transfer model to quantitatively predict the distribution in primary drying times in vials in the batch. A method was developed to experimentally measure the spatial variation in pressure in the drying chamber using a differential <b>capacitance</b> <b>manometer</b> and custom-made rig installed in a laboratory freeze-dryer. These measured pressure gradients were found to have an insignificant effect on drying time in comparison to the variations in the position-based Kv or ice nucleation temperature-dependent dry product layer resistance. Lastly, the effect of heterogeneity in the freezing and the primary drying steps of lyophilization on the reconstitution time for a lyophilized high concentration monoclonal antibody was investigated. Differences in product temperature and drying times affected the cake properties such as wetting, disintegration and hydration, altering reconstitution times...|$|E
40|$|Gaseous {{pollutants}} {{have been}} an environmental concern since 1956, when the first clean air act {{was established in the}} United Kingdom. Monitoring of gaseous emissions is a legal requirement in most countries, and this has generated a large demand for inexpensive, portable, and versatile gas analysers for the measurement of gaseous emissions. Many of the current commercial gas analysers have differing advantages and disadvantages, however, high cost is an important factor. Instruments with low detection limits and the ability to measure multiple gases tend to be very expensive, whereas, single gas analysers tend to be much more affordable. A non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) spectrometer, originally developed for a previous M. Sc. project, has been further developed in order to increase the sensitivity and to extend the instrument to the measurement of multiple gases. This type of instrument would be useful for environmental, industrial, and research applications. The instrument was inexpensive to construct when compared with the cost of current commercial gas analysers, is robust, and is partially portable around the laboratory. Infrared radiation from two infrared sources, pass through adjacent sample and reference cells and into corresponding detector cells. A sample comprising the analyte gas is contained in the sample cell, a non-absorbing gas, such as argon, is contained in the reference cell, and pure analyte gas of interest is contained in the detector cells. The two identical detector cells, which follow the reference and sample cells in the infrared optic paths, communicate only through a differential <b>capacitance</b> <b>manometer</b> which accurately measures small pressure differences between the otherwise identical cells. Any trace amount of the analyte gas in the sample cell absorbs radiation, depleting the appropriate infrared frequencies. This results in lower energy incident on the sample detector cell, reducing the infrared induced pressure rise in that detector cell compared to the reference side detector cell. The pressure difference is ii proportional to the concentration of absorbing gas in the sample cell, which is then determined using a calibration graph. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide calibration graphs from 40 ppm to 1000 ppm have been successfully established, and detection limits of 10. 33 ppm for CO₂, 8. 81 ppm for N₂O and 9. 17 ppm for CH₄ were determined. Dried air samples measured using the spectrometer gave an average value of 382 ± 9. 6 ppm which can be compared to the latest global atmospheric loading of 382. 4 ppm...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the mechanism of}} pressure broadening one must have accurate values of the pressure broadening coefficients {{as a function of}} vibrational quantum number. Unfortunately, such data for polyatomic molecules are scarce. The coefficient for self-broadening of methane {{has been found to be}} the same for the R(0) and R(1) lines of the 2 {nu}{sub 3 } and 3 {nu}{sub 3 } bands and for an unidentified line of the 5 {nu}{sub 1 } + {nu}{sub 3 } band at 6190 {angstrom} (1). Measurements have also been performed on the {nu}{sub 2 } (2) and {nu}{sub 1 } + {nu}{sub 3 } (3) bands of acetylene. In the work described here, high resolution spectra of single vibrational-rotational lines of the 5 {nu}{sub 3 } band of acetylene at 15, 600 cm{sup - 1 } have been taken to determine the coefficients for self-broadening at a much higher level of vibrational excitation. A single frequency cw dye laser (Spectra-Physics 580 A) with Rhodamine B as the lasing medium is used as a narrow bandwidth light source. The laser is continuously scannable over a 10 GHz region with 30 MHz linewidth. The unfocused beam is chopped and directed through a small, nonresonant optoacoustic cell. The pressure of the acetylene (> 99. 99 % purity) in the cell is measured with a <b>capacitance</b> <b>manometer.</b> The optoacoustic signal is detected by a miniature electret microphone placed within the cell and is processed by a lock-in amplifier. The high resolution scans are calibrated ({+-} 5 %) by monitoring the dye laser output with a spectrum analyzer equipped with 2 GHz FSR mirrors. All spectra were taken at room temperature (293 {+-} 2 K). At the relatively low pressures used in these experiments, the experimental linewidths are not more than three times the Doppler width (1. 1 GHz FWHM). The method of Gronwall was used to calculate values of the Voigt lineshape. With these data, the pressure broadened widths, {Delta}{nu}{sub p}, were extracted from the experimental lineshapes and are plotted as a function of pressure for the R(3), R(9), and R(15) lines in Figure 1. The lines drawn through the data points were determined by the linear least squares method. The self-broadening coefficients, {gamma}, and their standard errors are summarized in Table 1 along with the results of other workers...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to better understand the heat and mass transfer in freeze drying process and use this understanding to develop better guidelines for rational design, development and scale-up of freeze drying process. The main objective of a rational design of the freeze drying process is to obtain a stable and elegant product with minimal intra- and inter-batch variability. In addition, the designed freeze drying process should be robust and easily scaleable and transferable from one lyophilizer to another. During process development, there exist a number of manufacturing challenges such as differences in loading room environment, equipment design and capacity, load/batch size, container closure system, which needs to be taken into consideration during lyophilization cycle development and scale-up. ^ Variations in degree of supercooling between laboratory and production scale freeze-dryer results in differences in product temperature and drying time. To achieve homogeneous drying rate, the ice nucleation temperature for product vials within the same batch was controlled by using the reduced pressure ice fog technique. ^ Since primary drying is the longest step, optimization of this step is the focus in industry. Several analytical techniques (comparative pressure measurement (Pirani vs. <b>Capacitance</b> <b>Manometer),</b> dewpoint monitor, Tunable Diode Laser Absoprtion Spectroscopy (TDLAS), Lyotrack (Gas Plasma Spectroscopy), condenser pressure, pressure rise test, and product thermocouple were compared to determine the end point of primary drying. Besides being inexpensive, the midpoint of drop in the Pirani pressure is a good indicator of the end point of primary drying. ^ Further, gas flow dynamics in the duct connecting the chamber and the condenser imposes an upper limit to the maximum sublimation rate that a given lyophilizer can handle. At a fixed chamber pressure sublimation rate increases as the condenser pressure decreases. However, sublimation rate increases only until the gas flow velocity reaches Mach I limit (at which gas velocity equals speed of sound) at the duct exit. Further increase in sublimation rate results in loss of chamber pressure control (i. e., choked flow). From the sublimation test, choked flow was observed experimentally for the pressure range studied (60 - 200 mTorr) at different shelf temperature set point. Also, the Fluent simulation results predicted that the gas flow velocity reaches the speed of sound (i. e., Mach I limit) at the duct exit under the experimental conditions studied resulting in loss in chamber pressure control. ^ Key process parameters such as product temperature and drying time were significantly effected under different load conditions on a laboratory, pilot as well as a clinical scale freeze-dryer. Under partial load conditions, radiation effects dominate as the fraction of edge vials, which experience higher heat transfer via radiation, increases as the load on the shelf decreases. For an optimized process, even at 50 % of full load condition, cycle adjustments are required to achieve same product temperature profile as at 100 % of full load. ^ The container-closure system is another important variable during freeze-drying. There are freezing as well as drying difference between traditional containers (i. e., glass tubing vials) and glass syringes. An aluminum block holder system improved the heat and mass transfer compared to a plexiglass holder for freeze-drying in syringes. ^ The steady state theory of heat and mass transfer in freeze-drying was used to interpret the experimental data from various process development and scale up experiments and to make adjustments in cycles in different dryers to obtain equivalent product thermal histories. Further, general guidelines were developed to help in rational design, development and scale-up of the freeze-drying process. ...|$|E
