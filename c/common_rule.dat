5|$|Mary met {{her husband}} in Zagreb on 4July. She officially {{remained}} Sigismund's co-ruler {{until the end of}} her life, but her influence on government was minimal. Sigismund's land grants were always confirmed with Mary's own great seal {{during the first year of}} their <b>common</b> <b>rule,</b> but thereafter the grantees rarely sought her confirmation. Royal charters counted her regnal years not from her ascension, but from her husband's coronation. Nevertheless, Mary persuaded her husband to torture and execute John Horvat who was captured in July 1394 although Sigismund would have been willing to spare his life.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb is to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of}} these advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E
5|$|The Defective Premises Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons as a private member's bill by Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971, and given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972, coming into force as the Defective Premises Act 1972 on 1 January 1974. The Act establishes a duty of care builders and their sub-contractors owe to the occupiers of property they construct or modify, and also establishes a duty of care landlords hold towards their tenants and any third parties who might be injured by their failure to maintain or repair property. The Act received a mixed reaction from critics; while some complimented it on its simple nature compared to the previously complex <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> laws, others felt that it was too limited for what was desired to be achieved, and that the wording used was at times both too vague and too specific.|$|E

25|$|The Conciliation and Arbitration Act {{provided}} at s 38(f) that the Arbitration Court could declare an award to be a <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> of any industry. The other constitutional argument {{was that the}} Australian parliament had no power to provide for <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> awards. There were two impediments to this argument (1) the award had not at that time been declared to be a <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> award and (2) The boot manufacturers who applied to the High Court were all {{parties to the dispute}} and thus would be bound by the Award regardless. As Higgins had noted, the High Court will not answer a constitutional question unless it is necessary. The State of Victoria had intervened in the case to protect the public of that State from the operation of what it said was an invalid federal law. The argument was that the <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> provisions were invalid and could not be severed from the balance of the Act, such that the entire Act was invalid.|$|E

25|$|Griffith CJ {{expressed}} stronger {{views in}} relation to the constitutionality of the <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> provisions, stating that the function of an arbitrator was a judicial function that could only be exercised between parties to the dispute and after hearing them. The power to make a <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> award was a legislative function which, consistent with the decision in Whybrow (No 1), could not be conferred on the Arbitration Court. Griffith CJ emphasised the settlement of disputes between parties, with no apparent consideration as to the constitutional power {{in relation to}} the prevention of disputes. Griffith CJ held that the <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> provisions being unconstitutional did not invalidate the entire Act.|$|E

The Benedictine monasteries spread from Italy throughout Europe, being always by far the most numerous in England. They were followed by the Cluniac order, the Cistercians, Carthusians and Augustinian Canons. During the Crusades, the military orders of the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar were founded.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} main types of monastics. Those {{who live in}} monasteries under a <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> are coenobitic. Each monastery may {{formulate}} its own rule, and {{although there are no}} religious orders in Orthodoxy some respected monastic centers such as Mount Athos are highly influential. Eremitic monks, or hermits, are those who live solitary lives. It is the yearning of many who enter the monastic life to eventually become solitary hermits. This most austere life is only granted to the most advanced monastics and only when their superiors feel they are ready for it.|$|E
25|$|This secluded runestone {{is located}} in a grove near Väsby, Uppland, Sweden. It was raised by a Viking in {{commemoration}} of his receiving one danegeld in England. It is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr3 and, together with U 344, it has been said to be the earliest example of an Urnes style inscription in Uppland. The runic text follows a <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> to only carve a single rune for two consecutive letters, even when the letters were {{at the end of one}} word and the beginning of a second word. When the text shown as Latin characters, the transliterated runes are doubled and separate words are shown.

25|$|Domenico Carlo Maria Dragonetti (7 April 1763 – 16 April 1846) was an Italian {{double bass}} virtuoso and {{composer}} with a 3 string double bass. He stayed {{for thirty years}} {{in his hometown of}} Venice, Italy and worked at the Opera Buffa, at the Chapel of San Marco and at the Grand Opera in Vicenza. By that time he had become notable throughout Europe and had turned down several opportunities, including offers from the Tsar of Russia. In 1794, he finally moved to London to play in the orchestra of the King's Theatre, and settled there for the remainder of his life. In fifty years, he became a prominent figure in the musical events of the English capital, performing at the concerts of the Philharmonic Society of London as well as in more private events, where he would meet the most influential persons in the country, like the Prince Consort and the Duke of Leinster. He was acquainted with composers Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven, whom he visited on several occasions in Vienna, and to whom he showed the possibilities of the double bass as a solo instrument. His ability on the instrument also demonstrated the relevance of writing scores for the double bass in the orchestra separate from that of the cello, which was the <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> at the time. He is also remembered today for the Dragonetti bow, which he evolved throughout his life.|$|E
500|$|As these {{qualifying}} exams {{are extremely}} rigorous, support is usually available to people progressing through the exams. Often, employers provide paid on-the-job study time and paid attendance at seminars {{designed for the}} exams [...] Also, many companies that employ actuaries have automatic pay raises or promotions when exams are passed. As a result, actuarial students have strong incentives for devoting adequate study time during off-work hours. A <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb for exam students is that, for the Society of Actuaries examinations, roughly 400hours of study time are necessary for each four-hour exam [...] Thus, thousands of hours of study time should be anticipated over several years, assuming no failures [...]|$|E
500|$|There is a {{limit to}} the {{applicability}} of this lumped element model. [...] The model works well if the components are small enough that the time taken for a wave to cross them is insignificant, or equivalently, if there is no significant phase difference in the wave either side of the component. [...] What amounts to significant depends on how accurate the model is required to be, but a <b>common</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb is to require components to be smaller than one sixteenth of a wavelength. [...] Since wavelength decreases with frequency, this puts an upper limit on the frequency that can be covered in this kind of design. [...] This limit is much lower in the mechanical domain than the equivalent limit in the electrical domain. [...] This is because the much higher propagation speeds in the electrical domain lead to longer wavelengths (mechanical vibrations in steel propagate at about 6,000m/s, electromagnetic waves in common cable types propagate at about [...] ). [...] For instance, traditional mechanical filters are only made up to around 600kHz (although MEMS devices can operate at much higher frequencies due to their very small size). [...] In the electrical domain, on the other hand, the transition from the lumped element model to the distributed element model occurs in the hundreds of megahertz region.|$|E
