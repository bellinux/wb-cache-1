50|$|Cutter {{location}} is {{the topic of}} where to locate the cutter {{in order to achieve}} the desired contour (geometry) of the workpiece, given that the cutter's size is non-zero. The most common example is <b>cutter</b> <b>radius</b> compensation (CRC) for endmills, where the centerline of the tool will be offset from the target position by a vector whose distance is equal to the <b>cutter's</b> <b>radius</b> and whose direction is governed by the left/right, climb/conventional, up/down distinction. In most implementations of G-code, it is G40 through G42 that control CRC (G40 cancel, G41 left/climb, G42 right/conventional). The radius values for each tool are entered into the offset register(s) by the CNC operator or machinist, who then tweaks them during production {{in order to keep the}} finished sizes within tolerance. Cutter location for 3D contouring in 3-, 4-, or 5-axis milling with a ball-endmill is handled readily by CAM software rather than manual programming. Typically the CAM vector output is postprocessed into G-code by a postprocessor program that is tailored to the particular CNC control model. Some late-model CNC controls accept the vector output directly, and do the translation to servo inputs themselves, internally.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} find a common {{approach}} to plan the turning of a bio-inspired hexapod robot, a locomotion strategy for turning and deviation correction of a hexapod walking robot based on the biological behavior and sensory strategy of ants. A series of experiments using ants were carried out where the gait and the movement form of ants was studied. Taking {{the results of the}} ant experiments as inspiration by imitating the behavior of ants during turning, an extended turning algorithm based on arbitrary gait was proposed. Furthermore, after the observation of the radius adjustment of ants during turning, a <b>radius</b> <b>correction</b> algorithm based on the arbitrary gait of the hexapod robot was raised. The <b>radius</b> <b>correction</b> surface function was generated by fitting the correction data, which made it possible for the robot to move in an outdoor environment without the positioning system and environment model. The proposed algorithm was verified on the hexapod robot experimental platform. The turning and <b>radius</b> <b>correction</b> experiment of the robot with several gaits were carried out. The results indicated that the robot could follow the ideal radius and maintain stability, and the proposed ant-inspired turning strategy could easily make free turns with an arbitrary gait...|$|R

The undeformed and deformed chip dimensions, {{is a function of}} cutter rotation angle, instantaneous <b>cutter</b> <b>radius,</b> helix angle, and other processing parameters.

In this limit the guiding center velocity {{in the direction}} perpendicular to a homogeneous magnetic field is approximated by the E x B 0 /B 20 -velocity. The electron Larmor radius can safely be set to zero for most relevant conditions, but the ion-dynamics are noticeably influenced by finite Larmor radius effects. We analyzed the effects of finite Larmor <b>radius</b> <b>corrections</b> on the ion velocity and density by using a fluid model where these effects are included by a computationally simple filtering operation.

Surface roughness is mostly used to evaluate to the surface integrity. A theoretical surface roughness model for high face milling was established. The influence of cutting parameters on the surface roughness is analyzed. The surface roughness decreases when the <b>cutter</b> <b>radius</b> increases, total number of tooth and rotation angular speed, while it increases with the feeding velocity. The high speed face milling can get a smooth surface and it can replace the grinding with higher efficiency...|$|R

While, these approximate cutting methods cause the unavoidable residual hight Δh, and this Δh is related to Δx, Δy and <b>cutter</b> <b>radius</b> r. The relations among these are discussed on the cuttings of the circumferences and straight lines had any angles of inclination which we encounter well in cutting operations generally...|$|R

Fast and {{economical}} removal of icing {{snow on the}} airport runways, road, highways and other roads {{is a problem for}} keeping traffic flowing and driving safety in frozen weather. Based on the analysis of current researches on various mechanical deicing methods, a new mechanical-milling deicing method was presented. The milling cutting model was constructed by improving the cutting model. Subsequently, power design calculation of the milling equipment is also carried out.

However, {{in order to}} profit of the benefits multi-core processors can bring, the software has to be tailored to real parallel execution. In this paper a concept is proposed for partitioning numerical control software functions for being concurrently executed on multi-core systems. Specifically, the interpreter and the <b>cutter</b> <b>radius</b> compensation modules have been analyzed for devising a feasible parallel architecture.

Then the present report describes on several conditions required to expand the design method of hypoid gears heretofore into the angular hypoid gears. Consequently the design elements of the offset, the spiral angle, the <b>cutter</b> <b>radius,</b> the curvature of the tooth trace, and so on have been treated as a positive value usually, but it becomes clear that they have to mark the plus or minus sign for the method of common design...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} study on the effect of undetected stellar companions on the derived {{planetary}} radii for Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs). The current production of the KOI list assumes that each KOI is a single star. Not accounting for stellar multiplicity statistically biases the planets toward smaller radii. The bias toward smaller radii depends on the properties of the companion stars and whether the planets orbit the primary or the companion stars. Defining a planetary <b>radius</b> <b>correction</b> factor, X_R, we find that if the KOIs are assumed to be single, then, on average, the planetary radii may be underestimated by a factor of 〈X_R〉 ≈ 1. 5. If typical radial velocity and high-resolution imaging observations are performed and no companions are detected, then this factor reduces to 〈X_R〉 ≈ 1. 2. The correction factor 〈X_R〉 is dependent on the primary star properties and ranges from 〈X_R〉 ≈ 1. 6 for A and F stars to 〈X_R〉 ≈ 1. 2 for K and M stars. For missions like K 2 and TESS where the stars may be closer than the stars in the Kepler target sample, observational vetting (primary imaging) reduces the <b>radius</b> <b>correction</b> factor to 〈X_R〉 ≈ 1. 1. Finally, we show that if the stellar multiplicity rates are not accounted for correctly, then occurrence rate calculations for Earth-sized planets may overestimate the frequency of small planets by as much as 15 %– 20 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract High speed {{cutting of}} {{hardened}} steel SKD 61 (HRC 53) became {{possible by the}} introduction of a sintered carbides endmill coated by (Al,Ti) N. According to machining experiments, typical tool life of this endmill cutter is about 320 m for straight line cutting. It becomes, however, only 30 m for inner cylindrical surface cutting of the radius ratio ro/r = 2 (r: <b>cutter</b> <b>radius,</b> ro: machined geometry radius), which is often used for the machining of die/mold. This short tool life is caused by the rapid increase of cutting force, temperature elevation on the cutting tool, and chip jamming, all of which are easily introduced at inner curve cutting. By applying the constant cutting force control technique, the tool life can be elongated to 110 m. To regulate the cutting force at a constant level, the feed forward control is used based on a mathematical model of cutting force.

40|$|Standard 20 ° {{spur gears}} are {{typically}} generated {{with a whole}} depth of 2. 2 – 2. 25 times the module. At the nominal centre distance, this leaves a radial clearance, which is in itself redundant from a functional point of view. However, the intrinsic geometry of the cutting process always results in a non-involute root profile (the trochoid), which is even more pronounced {{in the case of}} using a rounded cutter tip in order to increase the strength of the cutting edge. Larger tip radii produce stronger tooth fillets, potentially increasing the bending strength, but reducing the involute part of the tooth. Thereby, they increase the risk of interference with mating gears. This paper performs a parametric investigation of the combined effect of the <b>cutter</b> <b>radius</b> and the dedendum on the clearance and the resulting tooth bending strength using analytical calculations, computerised generation and finite element simulations to determine the exact tooth geometry in search of stronger tooth forms. Non-dimensional modelling is used to obtain results applicable to entire gear families...|$|R

40|$|The {{propagation}} of dispersive Alfvén waves in a low-beta collisionless plasma with a high-density channel {{aligned with the}} ambient magnetic field, is studied in three space dimensions. A fluid model retaining linear Landau damping and finite Larmor <b>radius</b> <b>corrections</b> is used, together with a hybrid particle-in-cell simulation aimed to validate the predictions of this Landau-fluid model. It is shown that when the density enhancement is moderate (depending on the pump wavelength and the plasma parameters), the wave energy concentrates into a filament whose transverse size is prescribed by the dimension of the channel. In contrast, {{in the case of}} a stronger density perturbation, the early formation of a magnetic filament is followed by the onset of thin helical ribbons and the development of strong gradients.

The linear growth rates are determined and a strong stabilization of the instability for (k-perpendicular) (rho sub i) of 0. 2 or greater is observed. The nonlinear stage of the instability displays large vortices whose size is many times the initial velocity shear length. At saturation the simulation is dominated by the longest-wavelength mode permitted in the system.

40|$|Fatigue {{failures}} of rails often {{occur at the}} rail foot, since the geometry of this zone gives rise to stress concentrations under service loads or defects during rail manufacture and installation. In this paper, the fatigue behavior of cracks at the web/foot region of a rail is analyzed numerically.

40|$|The MHD and kinetic {{stability}} of an axially symmetric plasma, confined by a {{poloidal magnetic field}} with closed lines, is considered. In such a system the stabilizing effects of plasma compression and magnetic field compression counteract the unfavorable field line curvature and can stabilize pressure gradient driven magnetohydrodynamic modes provided the pressure gradient is not too steep. Isotropic pressure, ideal MHD stability is studied first and a general interchange stability condition and an integro-differential eigenmode equation for ballooning modes are derived, using the MHD energy principle. The existence of plasma equilibria which are both interchange and ballooning stable for arbitrarily large beta = plasma pressure / magnetic pressure, is demonstrated. The MHD analysis is then generalized to the anisotropic plasma pressure case. Using the Kruskal-Oberman form of the energy principle, and a Schwarz inequality, to bound the complicated kinetic compression term from below by a simpler fluid expression, a general anisotropic pressure interchange stability condition, and a ballooning equation, are derived. These reduce to the usual ideal MHD forms in the isotropic limit. It is typically found that the beta limit for ballooning modes is at or just below that for either the mirror mode or the firehose. (cont.) Finally, kinetic theory is used to describe drift frequency modes and finite Larmor <b>radius</b> <b>corrections</b> to MHD modes. An intermediate collisionality ordering in which the collision frequency is smaller than the transit or bounce frequency, but larger than the mode, magnetic drift, and diamagnetic frequencies, is used for solving the full electromagnetic problem. An integro-differential eigenmode equation with the finite Larmor <b>radius</b> <b>corrections</b> is derived for ballooning modes. It reduces to the ideal MHD ballooning equation when the mode frequency exceeds the drift frequencies. In addition to the MHD mode, this ballooning equation permits an entropy mode solution whose frequency is {{of the order of}} the ion magnetic drift frequency. The entropy mode is an electrostatic flute mode, even in equilibrium of arbitrary beta. Stability boundaries for both modes, and the influence of collisional effects on these boundaries has also been investigated. by Andrei N. Simakov. Thesis (Ph. D.)
