5000|$|One way {{to build}} a {{hardware}} random number generator is to use two independent <b>clock</b> <b>crystals,</b> one that for instance ticks 100 times per second and one that ticks 1 million times per second. On average the faster crystal will then tick 10,000 times for each time the slower one ticks. But since <b>clock</b> <b>crystals</b> are not precise, {{the exact number of}} ticks will vary. That variation can be used to create random bits. For instance, if the number of fast ticks is even, a 0 is chosen, and if the number of ticks is odd, a 1 is chosen. Thus such a 100/1000000 RNG circuit can produce 100 somewhat random bits per second.Typically such a system is biased—it might for instance produce more zeros than ones—and so hundreds of somewhat-random bits are [...] "whitened" [...] to produce a few unbiased bits.|$|R

40|$|Time Synchronization is {{essential}} for data transmission through wireless sensor networks(WSN). Each individual node in a WSN contains a <b>crystal</b> <b>clock.</b> Although the natural frequency of each <b>crystal</b> <b>clock</b> remains relatively constant, {{the quality of the}} crystal and environmental factors such as temperature cause the frequency to drift over time. In order to ensure that each node broadcasts the same global time within the micro-second range a time synchronization protocol must be implemented. Several protocols have been developed however none has been developed with security in mind. It is easy for an adversary to compromise a node causing faulty time sync messages to be sent out into the network. The Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol (FTSP) is the proposed protocol. The FTSP is made up of several component moduleswritteninnesCandisimplementedintheTinyOSenvironment. TinyOSisanopensourceoperatingsystemdevelopedspecifically for network systems. In order to investigate the effects of injecting bad time synchronization messages into a WSN implemented with the FTSP, one or two nodes in a testbed of telos motes must be programmed to send faulty time sync messages. In order to determine the level security of the FTSP, the resulting global time errors will be recorded and evaluated. ...|$|E

5000|$|There is also {{a similar}} way to build a kind of [...] "software random number generator".

If the OS timer and the CPU run on two independent <b>clock</b> <b>crystals</b> the situation is ideal and {{more or less the same}} as the previous example. But even if they both use the same <b>clock</b> <b>crystal</b> the process/program that does the clock drift measurement is [...] "disturbed" [...] by many more or less unpredictable events in the CPU such as interrupts and other processes and programs that runs at the same time. Thus the measurement will still produce fairly good random numbers. Some argue they are then not true random numbers but they seem to be good enough for most needs.|$|R
