40|$|<b>Territorial</b> <b>competence</b> is, {{together}} with material competence and functional competence, {{one of the}} fundamental forms of competence, without which the precise competence of a judicial body in the resolution of a criminal matter cannot be established. Among the fundamental forms of <b>competence,</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>competence</b> is imperative by its extreme importance, being immutable, namely the judicial bodies can only build a case or try a criminal case if they are competent from the territorial point of view. Starting from this qualification, it is extremely important to know the criteria based on which <b>territorial</b> <b>competence</b> is established {{and the way in which}} they are enforced, aspects analyzed in this article. In the light of the Romanian criminal procedural regulations, the establishment of the <b>territorial</b> <b>competence</b> of the judicial bodies is done depending on two main coordinates – art. 30 (competence for offenses perpetrated in the country) and art. 31 (competence for offenses perpetrated abroad). The establishment of the <b>territorial</b> <b>competence</b> as a criterion for the establishment of the <b>territorial</b> <b>competence</b> in criminal matters implies the approach of both criminal law aspects and criminal procedure law aspects. Thus, from the point of view of substantial law, the appreciation of the place of perpetration of an offense is done by applying the territoriality principle. The proper enforcement of the territoriality principle in the establishment of the place of perpetration of the offense was characterized by different approaches that adopted in the criminal law doctrine several forms around which several theories have been built – the theory of action, result, unlawfulness, preponderance and ubiquity. Last but not least, from the point of view of criminal procedure law, the analysis and definition of the place of perpetration of the offense is done in accordance with the theory of ubiquity or equivalence, a dominant theory in criminal doctrine nowadays...|$|R

40|$|As one of {{the core}} {{elements}} of statehood, territory is inextricably linked to sovereignty. For this reason, jurisdiction is primarily territorial. In principle, the sphere of power of the sovereign state—including its competence to exercise legislative, judicial, and executive authority—applies {{within the confines of}} its own territory. Otherwise, the state risks interfering with the sovereignty of other states and thereby breaking {{one of the}} fundamental principles of Public International Law (PIL), that of sovereign equality. The principle of sovereign equality dictates that all assertions of jurisdiction have to be balanced with the sovereign rights of other states. This is why “a State’s competence to exercise jurisdiction over its own nationals abroad is subordinate to that State’s and other States’ <b>territorial</b> <b>competence.</b> ” By placing the emphasis on sovereignty, classic PIL treats the question of jurisdiction in a fairly straightforward manner...|$|R

Important steps were the cession of the Kingdom of Bohemia to Ferdinand II in 1617, and his election as King of Hungary and Croatia on 16 May 1618. A few days later (23 May) took place the Defenestration of Prague, where (primarily thanks to the intervention of his uncle, Cardinal Franz Seraph of Dietrichstein, Prince-Bishop and Duke of Olomouc), Maximilian managed to avoid the involvement of his Moravian estates in the following uprising. Finally, after further negotiations, Ferdinand II was unanimously elected as Holy Roman Emperor on 28 August 1619. Ten years later, on 7 August 1629, Maximilian received, according to the law of primogeniture, the title of Imperial Count Palatine (Kaiserliche Hofpfalzgraf) with unlimited <b>territorial</b> <b>competence.</b>|$|R
40|$|Many {{states have}} enacted extra-territorial child sex tourism (CST) offences. Despite the {{existence}} of these offences, some states, including Australia and the United Kingdom, continue to privilege <b>territorial</b> <b>competence</b> as the basis of criminal jurisdiction. However, many destination countries for CST in South-east Asia lack the capacity to support prosecutions in this crime. This article explores the utility of partnerships between local and international law enforcement agencies and NGOs to facilitate prosecution in the jurisdiction of the offence. Through a case study of Cambodia, the article argues that such partnership arrangements provide the resources and integration required to enable sexual offences against children, by foreign offenders, to be prosecuted. NGOs undertake complex strategies to address the immediate needs of exploited children, while seeking to maintain their capacity to influence government policy. The risks, challenges, and sustainability of such partnerships are discussed, along with wider implications for South-east Asia. © 2014 The Author. Journal of Law and Societ...|$|R

We have tried to remain as faithful {{as possible to the}} Community of Communities clinical sense, organizational and psychodynamic statements, while still trying to locate the huge experience behind the philosophy of the therapeutic community in the socio-political Italian context. In Italy, health work is heavily regulated within public institutions with their own competences that cover specific administrative services, different types of users and particular territorial areas. Especially in the health services to childhood, the institutional and legal powers that law administration attaches to families, public schools, social services of <b>territorial</b> <b>competence</b> and local health authorities, require an articulated taking charge, involving all these institutions, which is often added to the Juvenile Court of Justice, with its almost limitless powers of decree.

One of the latter deals with the metropolitan areas is a concept with rather recent use in Romanian literature and the practice of local self-government. So far, the implementation of the metropolitan concept has been put into practice in terms of different administrative territories, associating and co-operating to achieve efficiency in local development processes. This paper, however, builds upon the existing European and American literature on metropolitan areas and aims at designing a new partnership-based model of metropolitan areas suitable for the Romanian environment. In this respect, based on the European principles (namely: economic and social cohesion, specialisation, exclusivity and subsidiary), this model will analyse the mutations emerging with the changes in the local decision-making processes.

40|$|The {{debate on}} {{regional}} development has recently expanded from an increasingly comprehensive {{view on the}} resilience regarding regions, {{in response to a}} very diverse matrix of external shocks, including financial crises, dangerous climate changes, terrorist movements and extreme environmental disasters. The notion of location resilience emerges as a specific ability of localities in reacting, responding and dealing with changes and uncertainties facing adversity, as natural disasters or artificial ones. In Brazil, an emblematic case of regional resilience can be identified in the region of the Industrial Pole of Cubatão, SP where it is analyzing how a region which has been called the "Valley of Death" (1980), managed to reverse an imminent situation of losing its industrialization through joint efforts.

40|$|AbstractIn 2013, the Province of Potenza {{has adopted}} its provincial Master Plan, named Territorial Coordination Plan (TCP), that draws the local {{governmental}} proposals {{for the development}} of the provincial territory and, in particular, provides guidelines and support to the local actors (including Communities, private sector and Municipalities) for the correct land planning and use. Province of Potenza has <b>territorial</b> coordination <b>competences</b> over 100 Municipalities and is mostly characterized by all the mayor natural risks whose potential impacts on the community are very serious in case of disasters. For this reason, an important section of the TCP is dedicated to the risk assessment/management and to the mitigation activities as important actions to be performed also at the urban level. An innovative aspect developed in the TCP is the implementation of the “resilience of communities” policy in territorial planning, by introducing risks-mitigation directives and recommendations to be applied to the local and urban planning and strategic actions in order to involve the local actors, the private sector and the community itself in the resilience's implementation processes. The TCP gives some inputs to be followed by the Municipalities in their urban planning activities and Municipalities are asked to demonstrate how the urban planning proposals are resilient. For risks “active” mitigation at local level (namely the “structural” prevention), the Province will contribute - among the national/regional institutional framework - in seeking to promote or facilitate programs of territorial extraordinary maintenance to be implemented by the local governments, through the identification of possible financial mechanisms and procedural facilitation. The resilience process is accompanied by other territorial policy actions acting on the natural and built environment systems, such as strategies for adaptation to climate change and environmental protection, and by the technical, organizational and knowledge support provided to municipalities in the implementation process over the provincial territory...|$|R

DOI: 10. 1006 /jhge. 2002. 0411 This paper explores the emerging territorial framework of west Cornwall in relation to community expression and power. It examines such issues as increasing administrative <b>competence,</b> <b>territorial</b> order and communal action. However, although such notions as emerging territoriality, secular political development and local communal cohesion are often associated with studies of modernisation and the emergence of distinctly modern systems and relations, this paper focuses on a peripheral region during the later medieval period (c. 1350 – 1550) and identifies such transitions as inherent within this pre-modern society. Evolving local ecclesiastical patterns in Cornwall during the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries saw numerous small chapels and sub-parochial foundations struggling for status and recognition amid an increasingly well-delineated territorial framework of parishes. By relating accounts of incidents and episodes of local ecclesiastical politics and discord to the territorial expressions of community organisation, combinations of local people are identified that were operating to control and order their local affairs. As well as questioning the implicit assumptions that some geographers and other scholars have about a medieval society that was supposedly dominated by a collage of lordly manorial and high ecclesiastical power, this paper also makes space for theories of territoriality and organisational complexity as a way of examining the developments of a period for which the written record is both sparse and partial...|$|R
40|$|Before 1990, the {{services}} of general interest (SeGI) in Romania were entirely provided by the public authorities. Afterwards, the market was gradually liberalized and the SeGI captured the attention of private operators. Nowadays, the business sector is involved next to the public authorities in offering {{services of general interest}} so as to respond citizens' expectations. The cooperation between the public authorities and the business sector is more developed in the area of SeGI that prove to be profitable, such as waste service and public transport, rather than services that need high investments in infrastructure, such as electricity, gas and water supply service. Starting from these overall considerations this paper addresses the legal and institutional issues generated by the organising and the provision of SeGI, with a particular emphasis on the <b>territorial</b> distribution of <b>competences</b> and the derived responsibilities. It takes into consideration the classification of competences associated to local authorities {{as a result of the}} decentralisation process, which are divided into exclusive, shared and delegated ones. Two territorial levels are considered, namely the counties - LAU 1 (the same as NUTS 3) and the localities (municipalities, towns and communes) 2 ̆ 013 LAU 2. The development regions (NUTS 2) are not considered as they are not administrative units and, consequently, do not have competences in the administration of {{the services}} of general interest. A series of drawbacks, inconsistencies are revealed followed by reflections on the solutions adopted by the authorities in favour of economic liberalisation and sustainable development of the local communities. They are derived from the Law of communitarian services of public utilities no. 51 / 2006, which is the main pillar of the policy framework for the public services in Romania. Thus, the public services in Romania could be provided by direct and indirect management. The latter might represent the solution that would directly support the cooperation between the local public administration authorities and the business sector and would indirectly generate the liberalization of services of general interest. The paper is based on the research conducted under the auspices of the on-going ESPON project "Indicators and perspectives for services of general interest in territorial cohesion and development 2 ̆ 013 SeGI" (PS 1 - 16, No. 094 / 2011), in which Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies is one of the partners involved...|$|R
