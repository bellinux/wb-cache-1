40|$|The {{transparent}} soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can {{be considered}} an important model organism due to its ease of <b>cultivation,</b> <b>suitability</b> for high-throughput genetic screens, and extremely well-defined anatomy. C. elegans contains exactly 959 cells that are ordered in defined differentiated tissues. Although C. elegans only possesses 302 neurons, {{a large number of}} similarities among the neuropeptidergic signaling pathways can be observed with other metazoans. Neuropeptides are important messenger molecules that regulate a wide variety of physiological processes. These peptidergic signaling molecules can therefore be considered important drug targets or biomarkers. Neuropeptide signaling is in the nanomolar range, and biochemical elucidation of individual peptide sequences in the past without the genomic information was challenging. Since the rise of many genome-sequencing projects and the significant boost of mass spectrometry instrumentation, many hyphenated techniques can be used to explore the "peptidome" of individual species, organs, or even cell cultures. The peptidomic approach aims to identify endogenously present (neuro) peptides by using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry in a high-throughput way. Here we outline the basic procedures for the maintenance of C. elegans nematodes and describe in detail the peptide extraction procedures. Two peptidomics strategies (off-line HPLC-MALDI-TOF MS and on-line 2 D-nanoLC-Q-TOF MS/MS) and the necessary instrumentation are described. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{joins the}} menagerie of behavioral model systems {{next to the}} fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the marine snail Aplysia californica and the mouse. In contrast to Aplysia, which contains 20, 000 neurons having cell bodies of hundreds of microns in diameter, C. elegans harbors only 302 tiny neurons from which the cell lineage is completely described, {{as is the case}} for all the other somatic cells. As such, this nervous system appears at first sight incommensurable with those of higher organisms, although genome-wide comparison of predicted C. elegans genes with their counterparts in vertebrates revealed many parallels. Together with its short lifespan and ease of <b>cultivation,</b> <b>suitability</b> for high-throughput genetic screenings and genome-wide RNA interference approaches, access to an advanced genetic toolkit and cell-ablation techniques, it seems that this tiny transparent organism of only I mm in length has nothing to hide. Recently, highly exciting developments have occurred within the field of neuropeptidergic signaling in C. elegans, {{not only because of the}} availability of a sequenced genome since 1998, but especially because of state of the art post genomic technologies, that allow for molecular characterization of the signaling molecules. Here, we will focus on endogenous, bioactive (neuro) peptides and mainly discuss biosynthesis, peptide sequence information, localization and G-protein coupled receptors of the three major peptide families in C. elegans.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of open areas as grasslands and croplands {{has become a}} vital issue addressed to biodiversity conservation. For this purpose, innovation in agricultural activities may be a key factor. To achieve this goal, {{it is essential to}} identify the agronomic suitability and the most appropriate spatial pattern for the proposed cultivation. Therefore, the definition of land suitability classes and of their boundaries is a key step. For this purpose we used the phytosociological approach since it is based on an ecological definition and hierarchical classification of plant communities and landscapes and can be considered as an indirect way to assess the variation of the environmental conditions. Starting from the Marche Region vegetation geo-database, for each vegetation series a draft of the main ecological factors matching with the ecological needs of Crocus sativus L. was carried out. Afterwards, two intermediate maps were drawn: the “Climatic suitability map” and the “Soil suitability map”. Finally, the “Crocus sativus <b>cultivation</b> <b>suitability</b> map” was drawn by overlapping these two maps. Results were tested by agronomic experimentations. The synphytosociological approach proved to be a very valuable method. In fact, the areas belonging to the highlighted different suitability classes (that is the different vegetation series) showed substantial differences in the saffron productivity. Moreover using the vegetation mapping procedures also the definition of the borders of each suitability class has been easily solved at the landscape scale...|$|E

Using the taxes-cropland area and number of families compiled from historical documents, we estimated the real cropland area and populations within each Lu (a province-level political region in the Northern Song Dynasty) in the mid-Northern Song Dynasty (AD 1004 - 1085). The estimations were accomplished through analyzing the contemporary policies of tax, population and agricultural development. Then, we converted the political region-based cropland area to geographically explicit grid cell-based fractional cropland at the cell size of 60 km by 60 km. The conversion was based on calculating <b>cultivation</b> <b>suitability</b> of each grid cell using the topographic slope, altitude and population density as the independent variables. As a result, the total area of cropland within the Northern Song territory in the 1070 s was estimated to be about 720 million mu (Chinese area unit, 1 mu = 666. 7 m(2)), of which 40. 1 % and 59. 9 % occurred in the north and south respectively.

Some sixteen soil series were studied on six land units by precise soil survey and their morphological and physicochemical properties were determined. Climatic and land qualities/characteristics for each crop were determined using the tables of crop requirements. An interpolation function was used to map values to scores in terms of land qualities/characteristics for land utilization types and the evaluation was carried out according to Kalogirou parametric approach. The interpolation technique by GIS functions helped in managing the spatial data and visualizing the results. Land suitability assessment for selected crops at the study area indicated that the priority for crops culture is wheat, mays and cotton, respectively.

40|$|O conhecimento indígena sobre a pedodiversidade é o objeto {{principal}} da etnopedologia. Nesse sentido, a tradição agrícola e cultural dos índios Uapixana, do tronco lingüístico Aruaque, em Roraima, constitui relevante acervo imaterial de valor etnocientífico, sendo valorizada pela Universidade Federal de Roraima em seus cursos superiores de Educação Indígena no Estado. Neste trabalho confrontou-se a experiência etnopedológica dos índios Uapixana com o Sistema Brasileiro de Classificação de Solos, durante o levantamento de solos da Terra Indígena (TI) Malacacheta. O sistema de classificação etnopedológica existente na comunidade indígena Uapixana da TI Malacacheta identifica e separa todos os principais compartimentos ambientais de ocorrência na área, permitindo relacionar aspectos de simples percepção e identificação (cor, textura, profundidade, vegetação) com aspectos cognoscíveis (uso, tipo de cultivo, vocação, etc.). Os índios Uapixana identificam e classificam oito tipos básicos de solos, que ocorrem individualmente ou formando associações: Imii Wyzda'u (Terra Amarelada), Imii Wyza'u (Terra Vermelha), Imii Pudiidiu (Terra Preta), Imii Pudiidiza'u (Terra Roxa), Katy Bara Pudiidiu (Barro Arenoso), Imii Kaxidia'u (Estopa Preta), Imii Katy Bara Pudiidiu Naik Baraka'u (Terra Arenosa Preta e Branca) e Imii Wyzadaza'u Rik Pudiidiu (Miscelânea de Terra Amarela, Roxa e afloramentos de rocha), abordando características morfológicas, físicas e químicas e as principais limitações quanto ao uso agrícola. Há relação evidente entre a dimensão do saber etnopedológico o saber etnoecológico, em sentido amplo. A experiência etnopedológica representa, assim, a extensão de uma abrangente cadeia de inter-relações homem-meio, dentro do princípio universal da ecologia humana da paisagem. O diálogo etnopedológico travado entre a comunidade indígena e os pedólogos trouxe contribuições muito relevantes e mutuamente benéficas: facilitou a transferência de conhecimento entre dois saberes, in loco, desvendando boa parte das relações etnopedológicas e etnoecológicas e refletindo sobre "como" e "por que" cada grupo identificava um dado tipo de solo. Permitiu ainda delinear o esboço da distribuição dos solos com base no saber indígena, utilizando a extrapolação cartográfica disponível ao pedólogo; esse fato facilitou o próprio mapeamento convencional, especialmente no reconhecimento de inclusões e associações de solos. De forma mais destacada, a experiência permitiu ainda uma real comunicação e aproximação entre os agentes do saber (indígenas e técnico), com base na troca e em descobertas mútuas de conhecimentos, gerando uma sinergia que aproxima o técnico e o indígena, com resultados práticos palpáveis, que extrapolam o próprio objetivo inicial do levantamento de solos da TI Malacacheta. Ethnopedology deals {{mainly with}} indigenous knowledge on pedo-diversity. In this sense, the agricultural and cultural {{traditions of the}} Wapishana Indians in Roraima, of the Arawak linguistic background, constitute a relevant pool of ethno-scientific knowledge in Amazonia. The Federal University of Roraima has increasingly acknowledged their importance in the Indigenous Education undergraduate courses. In this study, the ethnopedological classifications of the Wapishana Indians were confronted with the Brazilian System of Soil Classification in a soil survey of the Malacacheta Indian Territory. The ethnopedological classification of Wapishana Indians identifies and separates all environmental segments of the area, relating easily recognizable aspects of the soilscape (color, texture, depth, vegetation) with observable aspects (land use, <b>cultivation</b> type, <b>suitability).</b> The Wapishana classify eight basic soil types, that occur either separately or in associations: Imii Wyzda'u (Yellowish earth), Imii Wyza'u (Red earth), Imii Pudiidiu (Black Earth), Imii Pudiidiza'u (Dusky-Red Earth), Katy Bara Pudiidiu (Sandy loam), Imii Kaxidia'u (Black spongy), Imii Katy Bara Pudiidiu Naik Baraka'u (Black and White Sandy Ground) and Imii Wyzadaza'u Rik Pudiidiu (Mixed Yellowish earth, Dusky-Red earth and Rock outcrops), based on morphological, physical and chemical attributes, as well as land use limitations. There are clear relationships between the ethnopedological knowledge and the ethno-ecological dimension of the Wapishana culture, in the broadest sense. The ethnopedological observations, thus, represent {{an expression of the}} interwoven network of man-environment relationships, seen in a framework of universal principles of human/landscape ecology. The intense ethnopedological dialogue between soil scientists and Indians resulted in enriching, mutually beneficial contributions: the proper knowledge transfer in loco between two different traditions, the clarification of great part of the ethnopedological perceptions of both groups, and the understanding on how and why each group identified a given soil. Moreover, a soil map based on indigenous knowledge was drawn up, in an extrapolation of the cartographical base available to pedologists; this supported the conventional soil mapping of the area as well, especially in the recognition of soil inclusions and associations. Particularly, the experience allowed effective communication and approach of the representatives of indigenous and technical knowledge, based on knowledge transfer and mutual discoveries of understanding, creating synergy effects with promising results, which outreached the original aim of soil mapping of the Malacacheta Indian Territory...|$|R
