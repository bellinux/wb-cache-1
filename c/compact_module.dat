The use of LEDs allows the CIS to be highly power efficient, allowing scanners to be powered through the minimal line voltage supplied via a USB connection. CIS devices typically produce lower image quality compared to CCD devices; in particular, the depth of field is greatly limited, which poses a problem for material that is not perfectly flat. However, a CIS contact sensor is smaller and lighter than a CCD line sensor, and allows all the necessary optical elements {{to be included in}} a <b>compact</b> <b>module,</b> thus helping to simplify the inner structure of the scanner. With a CIS contact sensor, the scanner can be portable, with a height of only around 30 mm.CIS is both a key component of, and widely used in, scanners (especially portable scanners), electrographs, bar code readers and optical identification technology.|$|E

50|$|Many algebraically <b>compact</b> <b>modules</b> can be {{produced}} using the injective cogenerator Q/Z of abelian groups. If H is a right module over the ring R, one forms the (algebraic) character module H* consisting of all group homomorphisms from H to Q/Z. This is then a left R-module, and the *-operation yields a faithful contravariant functor from right R-modules to left R-modules. Every module of the form H* is algebraically compact. Furthermore, there are pure injective homomorphisms H → H**, natural in H. One can often simplify a problem by first applying the *-functor, since algebraically <b>compact</b> <b>modules</b> are easier to deal with.|$|R

Since 2008 there has been considerable turnover in administration. At first his daughter Sisiʻuno assumed the post of institute director in 2008, followed by his son Niulala in 2009, with Sisiʻuno returning in 2010. University management experienced turnover as well, with Dr. Michael Horowitz taking over as dean from 2008-2010, followed by Dr. Marilyn Dudley-Flores in 2011-2012. Dr. ʻOpeti Taliai, a Tongan anthropologist who holds a Ph.D. from Massey University {{as well as an}} ʻAtenisi undergraduate degree, served as dean from 2013 to 2014; he had previously taught linguistics at the institute. But after regionally promoting an acclaimed novella published in New Zealand, Dr. Horowitz returned as dean in 2015. There has been incremental renovation of the campus since Dr. Helu's death in February 2010. Three dilapidated buildings - a science laboratory, print shop, and office cottage - have been removed, with the laboratory being replaced by a <b>compact</b> <b>module</b> erected by Group Construction that has, however, not yet been equipped for laboratory instruction. By September 2014 the former university library had been abandoned and its collection moved to a building on the campus quadrangle.|$|E

40|$|An {{approach}} for purifying nuclear proteins that bind {{directly to the}} hyperphosphorylated C-terminal repeat domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II was developed and used to identify one human phosphoCTD-associating protein as CA 150. CA 150 is a nuclear factor implicated in transcription elongation. Because the hyperphosphorylated CTD is a feature of actively transcribing RNA polymerase II (Pol II), phosphoCTD (PCTD) binding places CA 150 in a location appropriate for performing a role in transcription elongation-related events. Several recombinant segments of CA 150 bound the PCTD. Predominant binding is mediated by the portion of CA 150 containing six FF domains, <b>compact</b> <b>modules</b> of previously unknown function. In fact, small recombinant proteins containing the fifth FF domain bound the PCTD. PCTD binding is the first specific function assigned to an FF domain. As FF domains are found {{in a variety of}} nuclear proteins, it is likely that some of these proteins are also PCTD-associating proteins.
