25|$|Polyethylene with {{multimodal}} {{molecular weight}} distribution consists of several polymer fractions, which are homogeneously mixed. Such polyethylene types offer extremely high stiffness, toughness, strength, stress crack resistance and an increased <b>crack</b> <b>propagation</b> resistance. They consist of equal proportions higher and lower molekularerer polymer fractions. The lower molecular weight units crystallize easier and relax faster. The higher molecular weight fractions form linking molecules between crystallites, thereby increasing toughness and stress crack resistance. Polyethylene with multimodal {{molecular weight distribution}} can be prepared either in two-stage reactors, by catalysts with two different active centers on a carrier or by blending in extruders.|$|E

40|$|<b>Crack</b> initiation, <b>propagation</b> and microfracture {{processes}} of austempered high silicon cast steel {{have been investigated}} by using an in-situ tensile stage installed inside a scanning electron microscope chamber. It is revealed that micro cracks always nucleate at the yielding near imperfections and the boundary of matrix-inclusions due to the stress concentration. There are four types of <b>crack</b> <b>propagations</b> in the matrix: crack propagates along the boundary of two clusters of bainitic ferrite; crack propagates along the boundary of ferrite-austenite in bainitic ferrite laths; crack propagates into bainitic ferrite laths; crack nucleates and propagates in the high carbon brittle plate shape martensite which is transformed from some blocky retained austenite due to plastic deformation.

25|$|Fatigue {{is defined}} as failure of a {{material}} due to repeated/cyclic loading or unloading (tensile or compressive stresses). It {{is also an important}} parameter for biomaterial because cyclic load is applied during their serving life. In this cyclic loading condition, micro crack/flaws may be generated at the interface of the matrix and the filler. This micro crack can initiate permanent plastic deformation which results in large <b>crack</b> <b>propagation</b> or failure. During the cyclic load several factor also contribute to microcrack generation such as frictional sliding of the mating surface, progressive wear, residual stresses at grain boundaries, stress due to shear.|$|E

40|$|By {{using the}} {{two-dimensional}} finite element software FRANC 2 D (Fracture Analysis Code 2 D), {{the calculation of}} stress intensity factors at the crack tips has been implemented through simulating two collinear cracks {{and a pair of}} offset parallel <b>cracks</b> <b>propagation.</b> Interaction and influence between cracks of different geometry patterns with the <b>cracks</b> <b>propagation</b> were discussed. The influence of crack interaction on the direction of propagation was also represented. The results show that the interaction between cracks could produce either an enhancement or a shielding effect on the stress field depending on the geometry of cracks (including the positions of cracks, the lengths of cracks and so on). The stress field of two collinear cracks has always been enhanced and the maximum interaction would occur at the case where the two cracks have the same length. As for a pair of offset parallel cracks, the enhancement and the shielding effecting on the stress field form an inflection point at about the beginning of cracks overlap. The stress field has been affected by the ratio of lateral separation to crack length not the lateral separation 2 h for a pair of offset parallel cracks. Once the two <b>cracks</b> overlap, the <b>propagation</b> directions of <b>cracks</b> would turn. The inflection point and turning would fade with the increase of the ratio of lateral separation to crack length. At the same time, some experimental tests were carried out to validate the analysis results...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA four-point {{combined}} DE/FE {{algorithm is}} proposed to constrain the rotation of a discrete element about its linked point and analyze the <b>cracks</b> <b>propagation</b> of laminated glass. In this approach, four linked points on a discrete element are combined with four nodes of the corresponding surface of a finite element. The penalty method is implemented to calculate the interface force between the two subdomains, the finite element (FE) and the discrete element (DE) subdomains. The sequential procedure of brittle fracture is described by an extrinsic cohesive fracture model only in the DE subdomain. An averaged stress tensor for granular media, which is automatically symmetrical and invariant by translations, is used to an accurate calculation of the averaged stress of the DE. Two simple cases in the elastic range are given to certify {{the effectiveness of the}} combined algorithm and the averaged stress tensor by comparing with the finite element method and the mesh-size dependency of the combined algorithm and the cohesive model is also investigated. Finally, the impact fracture behavior of a laminated glass beam is simulated, and the <b>cracks</b> <b>propagation</b> is compared with experimental results showing that the theory in this work can be used to predict some fracture characteristics of laminated glass...|$|R
40|$|Fire-induced {{vibration}} of four panels A-D {{has been}} studied and also relevant furnace temperature, temperature gradient, deflections and cracking distributions introduced. Time-domain analysis indicating vibration intensity has important relationships with boundary constraints. According to vibration intensity, the whole vibration process {{can be divided into}} three stages. During the first and third stages, acceleration signals are relatively low but during the second stage, vibration signals are strong so that more signal mutations have been detected. The signal mutations are due to the appearance of the main cracks. Frequency-domain analysis adopting Hilbert Transform (HT) shows that frequencies have been affected by <b>cracks</b> <b>propagation</b> and boundary constraints but the changes have not been influenced by damage locations in each panel. Furthermore, frequencies have fluctuated little in the first stage, but during the second stage, frequencies have fluctuated dramatically as a result of <b>cracking</b> <b>propagations</b> and an obvious falling trend has appeared. Also, in this stage frequencies have increased as a result of temporary swelling and increased friction within the panels. In the third stage, frequencies have changed smoothly and declined quickly.   Moreover, the three stages of frequency changes correspond to the three stages of deflection changes in sequence. Therefore, characteristics of fire behaviour including deformation and cracks of the panels can be monitored through analysis of vibration...|$|R

In this paper, {{the effects of}} surface defects on RCF behavior of M 50 NiL and M 50 steels were studied experimentally. Artificial dents were introduced on the rolling surface by using Rockwell hardness tester. The influences of dent shape and dent shoulders were examined by thrust-type RCF tests. Surface <b>cracks</b> initiation, <b>propagation</b> and spalling were monitored by scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation. The results showed that artificial dents reduce RCF lives of M 50 NiL and M 50 steels with mineral oil lubrication. The fatigue failure initiates at the surface defect {{with the effects of}} dent shape and dent shoulder. M 50 NiL steel has higher contact fatigue resistance than M 50.
