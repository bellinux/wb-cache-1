50|$|It {{is often}} not {{possible}} to obtain the information needed to satisfy the test. In some circumstances underlying securities certificates may be kept {{in more than one}} jurisdiction. If the applicable law is the law of the place where the relevant securities certificates are stored, and the holding is through various tiers of intermediaries a <b>collateral</b> <b>taker</b> may be unable to discover where the securities certificates in questions are actually located.|$|E

Unlike in the United States, Canadian security interests in cash deposits are not perfected by control, as is allowed under Article 9 of the US Uniform Commercial Code. Registration is the only option, which can expose a counterparty to the risk of subordination to prior registered interests. It has been argued, however, {{that in the case of}} title transfers of securities (or cash in a securities account), provincial Securities Transfer Acts or other laws similar to UCCs Article 8 would ensure that the <b>collateral</b> <b>taker</b> should be perfected by control.|$|E

5000|$|The {{last decade}} has seen an {{enormous}} {{growth in the}} use of securities as collateral. Purchasing securities with borrowed money secured by other securities or cash itself is called [...] "buying on margin". Where A is owed a debt or other obligation by B, A may require B to deliver property rights in securities to A, either at inception (transfer of title) or only in default (non-transfer-of-title institutional). For institutional loans, property rights are not transferred but nevertheless enable A to satisfy its claims in the event that B fails to make good on its obligations to A or otherwise becomes insolvent. Collateral arrangements are divided into two broad categories, namely security interests and outright collateral transfers. Commonly, commercial banks, investment banks, government agencies and other institutional investors such as mutual funds are significant <b>collateral</b> <b>takers</b> as well as providers. In addition, private parties may utilize stocks or other securities as collateral for portfolio loans in securities lending scenarios.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{indirect}} holding system, securities are held through fungible accounts (omnibus accounts). Under such a system, {{there is no}} record of an individual investor's interest in respect of the securities {{at the level of the}} issuer's or intermediary's register, other than the intermediary with whom the investor has a direct relationship. Thus, if the investor, or a person such as a <b>collateral</b> <b>taker</b> asserting a claim against the investor's interest were to try to enforce that claim at any of these higher levels, the response would be that no record exists of any interest against which the claim could be pursued. This problem demonstrates that any attempt to apply the look-through approach under a fungible custody structure runs counter to the widespread conflict of laws principle that jurisdiction over proprietary aspects of dispositions of movable property should broadly be attributed to the jurisdiction where orders in respect of that property are capable of being enforced.|$|E

For example, if C^+_t> 0 then the legal owner of the amount C^+_t at time t could be either the hedger or the counterparty (depending on the legal covenants of the collateral agreement) but the hedger, as a <b>collateral</b> <b>taker,</b> is allowed to use the collateral amount for his trading purposes. If there is no default before T, the <b>collateral</b> <b>taker</b> returns the collateral amount to the collateral provider. Hence the amount C^+_t should be accounted for when dealing with the hedger’s portfolio, but should be excluded from his wealth. In general, we have the following definition of the wealth process.|$|E
40|$|Key points - The recent {{decision}} of the High Court of the British Virgin Islands in Alfa v Cukurova has caused a stir among lawyers serving the international financial markets based in London. - The decision concerns the meaning of ‘appropriation’. Appropriation is a new remedy for collateral takers introduced by the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003, which implement the Financial Collateral Directive. - The decision holds that effective appropriation requires the <b>collateral</b> <b>taker</b> to take over from the collateral giver the {{ability to deal with}} the collateral as its own. - In Cukurova, where an equitable mortgage was taken over directly held shares, this required that the <b>collateral</b> <b>taker</b> become the registered owner of the shares. - The decision was appealed to the BVI Court of Appeal in late January 2008 and may go further. In the meantime, this article provides an overview of the decision and considers its wider significance...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{regulators}} in the U. S. and the U. K. {{have protected}} the collateral takerâs right to re-use securities collateral in securities financing and OTC derivatives markets on {{the understanding that}} it would promote liquidity and credit growth, and reduce systemic risk. However, this rationale was incomplete: it failed to acknowledge the full implications of collateral re-use for systemic risk. In this dissertation, I aim to complete that understanding by illustrating how the re-use of securities collateral in those markets can aggravate systemic risk. In particular, I describe two effects. First, re-using securities collateral multiplies the number of market participants that will be exposed {{to changes in the}} price of the collateral asset and can thus amplify the role of asset prices as channels of contagion. Second, by conferring a right to re-use, the collateral provider will effectively waive its proprietary interests in the collateral assets and retain a mere contractual claim against the <b>collateral</b> <b>taker</b> for the return of equivalent securities. This transformation will accentuate the incentive of the collateral provider to run from an over-collateralised <b>collateral</b> <b>taker</b> if the latter were to experience financial difficulty. Information asymmetries and a lack of coordination among collateral providers could push the <b>collateral</b> <b>taker</b> over the brink of insolvency. These risks pose an obvious question for regulators: what should we do about collateral re-use? At a time when international bodies are drawing their attention to this widespread market practice, the question is an invitation to a very timely reflection. The final chapter of the dissertation offers an answer to this question and assesses the potential efficacy of the most recent regulatory initiatives in relation to collateral re-use. </p...|$|E
30|$|Let {{us first}} make some {{comments}} from the hedger’s perspective regarding the crucial features of the margin account. The financial practice may require to hold the collateral amounts in segregated margin accounts, so that the hedger, when he is a <b>collateral</b> <b>taker,</b> cannot {{make use of the}} collateral amount for trading. Another collateral convention mostly encountered in practice is rehypothecation (around 90 % of cash collateral of OTC contracts are rehypothecated), which refers to the situation where the hedger may use the collateral pledged by his counterparties as collateral for his contracts with other counterparties. Obviously, if the hedger is a collateral provider, then a particular convention regarding segregation or rehypothecation is immaterial for the dynamics of the value process of his portfolio. We refer the reader to Bielecki and Rutkowski (2015) and Crépey et al. (2014) for a detailed analysis of various conventions on collateral agreements. Here we will examine some basic aspects of collateralization (sometimes also called margining) in our context.|$|E
40|$|This paper derives {{a general}} {{framework}} for collateral risk control determination in repurchase transactions or repos. The {{objective is to}} treat consistently heterogeneous collateral so that the <b>collateral</b> <b>taker</b> has a similar risk exposure whatever the collateral pledged. The framework measures the level of risk with the probability of incurring a loss higher than a pre-specified level given two well known parameters used to manage the intrinsic risk of collateral: marking to market and haircuts. It allows for the analysis in a self contained closed form {{of the way in}} which di#erent relevant factors interact in the risk control of collateral (e. g. marking to market frequency, level of volatility of interest rates, time to capture and liquidity risk, probability of default of counterparty, etc.). The framework, which combines the recent theoretical literature on credit and interest risk, provides an alternative quantifiable and objective approach to the existing more ad-hoc rule-based methods used in haircut determination...|$|E
