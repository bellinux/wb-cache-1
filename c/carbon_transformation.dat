China has multiple objectives to develop a low carbon economy and to decrease carbon dioxide emission per unit of GDP, including mitigation of global climate change, security of energy supply, promotion of sustainable development (environmental protection, poverty alleviation, employment and natural conservation). In this regard, China's actions are more at the active side than from a pressure outside. However, there are some suspicions in the international society about whether China has the determination and efficiency in mitigation actions. The author demonstrates that China's low <b>carbon</b> <b>transformation</b> is largely driven from domestic considerations.

Several guidelines are currently used to investigate the effects of chemicals on selected microbial activities, as outlined in chapter R 7 c of the ECHA guidance for the implementation of Regulation (EC) 1907 / 2006 - the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) [1]. Two Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guidelines are available to detect chemical effects on soil microflora, i.e., the nitrogen and <b>carbon</b> <b>transformation</b> tests [2],[3]. These are designed to determine the long-term adverse effects of substances on nitrogen or <b>carbon</b> <b>transformation</b> in aerobic soils over at least 28 days. According to the guidance listed above [1], the nitrogen transformation test is considered sufficient for most non-agrochemical substances. Further ISO-standard methodologies are available, but in the absence of corresponding OECD guidelines, these methods are used less often than the two microbial assays mentioned above.

Chloroform and dichloromethane were the main transformation products, {{but part of the}} carbon tetrachloride was also completely dechlorinated to unknown products. Gram-positive sulfate-reducing bacteria were involved in the reductive dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride to chloroform and dichloromethane since both molybdate, an inhibitor of sulfate reduction, and vancomycin, an inhibitor of gram-positive bacteria completely inhibited <b>carbon</b> tetrachloride <b>transformation.</b> <b>Carbon</b> tetrachloride <b>transformation</b> by these bacteria was a cometabolic process and depended on the input of an electron donor and electron acceptor (sulfate).

40|$|Bacteria play an {{extraordinarily}} {{important role in}} <b>carbon</b> <b>transformations.</b> It is therefore crucial to accurately measure bacterial production. One {{of the most widely}} used methods is the leucine method. From rates of leucine incorporation bacterial carbon production can be derived by empirical or theoretical conversion factors (CFs). However, only few empirical CFs have been established, and no estimation of the theoretical conversion factor for freshwater systems exists until today. Therefore, we determined both, the empirical and the theoretical conversion factor, of sediment bacteria from a headwater stream. The empirical conversion factor determined from exponentially growing bacteria was 1. 445 kg C mol⁻¹. The theoretical conversion factor derived from the determination of the molar fraction of leucine in bacterial protein (0. 081 ± 0. 001) was 1. 442 kg C mol⁻¹. Both conversion factors are close to each other and similar to conversion factors established for marine bacterioplankton. Therefore, {{results of the present study}} indicate that high values of bacterial production determined in freshwater sediments by the leucine method in several studies were not overestimates caused by inappropriate use of CFs from marine systems but represent true high bacterial production in these environments.

40|$|Global Ocean Biogeochemistry General Circulation Models {{are useful}} tools to study {{biogeochemical}} processes at global and large scales under current climate and future scenario conditions. The credibility of future estimates is however {{dependent on the}} model skill in capturing the observed multi-annual variability of firstly the mean bulk biogeochemical properties, and secondly the rates at which organic matter is processed within the food web. For this double purpose, {{the results of a}} multi-annual simulation of the global ocean biogeochemical model PELAGOS have been objectively compared with multi-variate observations from the last 20 years of the 20 th century, both considering bulk variables and carbon production/consumption rates. Simulated net primary production (NPP) is comparable with satellite-derived estimates at the global scale and when compared with an independent data-set of in situ observations in the equatorial Pacific. The usage of objective skill indicators allowed us to demonstrate the importance of comparing like with like when considering <b>carbon</b> <b>transformation</b> processes. NPP scores improve substantially when in situ data are compared with modeled NPP which takes into account the excretion of freshly-produced dissolved organic carbon (DOC). It is thus recommended that DOC measurements be performed during in situ NPP measurements to quantify the actual production of organic carbon in the surface ocean. The chlorophyll bias in the Southern Ocean that affects this model as well as several others is linked to the inadequate representation of the mixed layer seasonal cycle in the region. A sensitivity experiment confirms that the artificial increase of mixed layer depths towards the observed values substantially reduces the bias. Our assessment results qualify the model for studies of <b>carbon</b> <b>transformation</b> in the surface ocean and metabolic balances. Within the limits of the model assumption and known biases, PELAGOS indicates a net heterotrophic balance especially in the more oligotrophic regions of the Atlantic during the boreal winter period.
