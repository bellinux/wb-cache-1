50|$|Clinical {{engineers}} are registered as clinical scientists by the HCPC. Assessment of trainees prior to registration {{is provided by}} the Association of Clinical Scientists (ACS) and the Academy of Healthcare Science (AHCS). There are two programmes for attaining registration from the HCPC as a clinical scientist. The first is a Certificate of Attainment, awarded on successful completion of the NHS Scientist Training Programme (STP), and the second is through the <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Equivalence,</b> awarded on successful demonstration of equivalence to the STP. This second route is normally chosen by individuals that have significant scientific experience prior to seeking registration. In March 2017 IPEM published a policy document stating their position on the routes of entry to clinical scientist registration.|$|E
50|$|NRM Member of Parliament for Bubulo West County Constituency in Manafwa District, Tonny Nsubuga Kipoi, who {{had been}} ordered out of Parliament on grounds of lack of sound {{academic}} qualifications, has retained his seat.This followed a-39-page-judgment in which the Court of Appeal stopped the High Court trial judge’s orders cancelling Kipoi’s certificate from Makerere University.The court also cancelled the High Court trial judge’s orders nullifying Kipoi’s election as MP for Bubulo West County Constituency and the order to conduct fresh by-election.“The trial judge’s order that the appellant’s certificate of recognition {{as a person who}} sat and past the Makerere University Mature Age Entry Examinations issued to him by the university be cancelled is hereby set aside.The trial judge’s orders that the Parliamentary elections for Bubulo West Constituency be nullified and a by-election be conducted in the Bubulo West Constituency are hereby, too, set aside,” the court ruled.The court also ordered the petitioners to pay Kipoi the costs of the petition in the High Court and in the Court of Appeal.Justice Steven Kavuma headed the coram. The other members were justices Augustine Sebutulo Nshimye and Remmy Kasule.The court’s registrar, Elias Omar Kisawuzi read the judgment on behalf of the court.Kipoi Tonny and Ronny Waluku Wataka together with others contested in the February 2011 Parliamentary elections for Bubulo West Constituency, which Kipoi won.However, being dissatisfied with the results, 803 voters including Wataka, petitioned the High Court at Mbale arguing that Kipoi was not validly elected.At the end of the trial, the court ruled that Kipoi should vacate his seat in Parliament arguing that his nomination and election was invalid on the ground that at that time he lacked the required academic qualifications.The court also said that the <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence</b> issued to him by the National Council of Higher Education, (NCHE) had been based on a certificate of recognition as a person, who had passed the mature age entry examinations that he had not sat.However, the court agreed with Hassan Kamba and Michael Okecha, who represented Kipoi that unless and until Makerere University recalled or cancelled its certificate of recognition, NCHE had no powers to revoke or cancel his <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>equivalence,</b> which he used to for nomination and election as MP.The court also agreed with the lawyers that the trial judge had no power to cancel the Makerere University Mature Age Entry Examination Certificate issued to Kipoi TonnyThey criticized the trial judge arguing that he erroneously evaluated the evidence on record and wrongly concluded that it was not the appellant that sat the mature age entry examinations.“Justice in the instant case called for a balance between expediency and the need to accord due recognition to the value of expert evidence and opinion in a highly contested and important matter concerning competition for political power and the all-important question of academic qualifications of an individual,” the court observed.In further agreement with Kamba and Okecha, the court said that it could uphold the trial judge’s findings that it was not the appellant who sat and passed the Makerere University mature age entry examinations that took place in 2010.The court note further that the trial judge was at fault to allow a witness against the appellant when he was all the time in court when the other witnesses were testifying and; when the appellant wanted to cross-examine him, he was denied the opportunity to do so, on the ground that he was a court’s witness, yet he had given damaging evidence against the appellant.|$|E
40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} {{if there had been}} changes {{in the size of the}} UK paediatric workforce and working patterns between 1999 and 2013. Design Analysis of prospectively collected datasets. Setting UK consultant paediatricians. Interventions Data from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health's workforce census from 1999 to 2013 and the annual surveys of new paediatric Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) and <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Equivalence</b> of Specialist Registration (CESR) holders between 2010 and 2013. Main outcome measures Paediatric consultant numbers, programmed activities (PAs) and resident shift working. Results The UK paediatric consultant workforce grew from 1933 in 1999 to 3718 in 2013. Over the same time period, there was a decline in the number of consultants with a primary academic contract from 210 to 143. There was an increase in the proportion of consultants who were female (40 % in 1999 to 50 % in 2013, p< 0. 01). The median number of PAs declined from 11 in 2009 to 10 in 2013 (p< 0. 001) as did the median number of PAs for supporting professional activities (2. 5 – 2. 3, p< 0. 001). In 2013, 38 % of new consultants in general paediatrics or neonatology were working resident shifts. Between 2009 and 2013, the proportion of less than full-time working consultants rose from 18 % to 22 %, which was more common among female consultants (35 % vs 9 %). Conclusion The paediatric consultant workforce has doubled since 1999, but more are working less than full time. The decline in those with a primary academic contract is of concern...|$|E
