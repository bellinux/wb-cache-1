25|$|In 1604, Shah Abbas I of Iran, {{concerned}} that the skilled peoples of Nakhichevan, its natural resources, and the surrounding areas <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> danger due to its relatively {{close proximity to the}} Ottoman-Persian frontline, decided to institute a scorched earth policy.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the EEF {{victories}} at the Battle of Romani, the Battle of Magdhaba and the Battle of Rafa, fought from August 1916 to January 1917, the EEF had pushed the defeated Ottoman Army eastwards. The EEF reoccupied the Egyptian territory of the Sinai Peninsula, and crossed over into the Ottoman Empire territory of southern Palestine. However, the result of the First Battle of Gaza had been as close to a British Empire victory as a defeat <b>could</b> <b>get.</b> <b>In</b> the three weeks between the two battles, the Gaza defences were strongly reinforced against a frontal attack. The strong entrenchments and fortifications proved unassailable during the disastrous frontal attacks, when EEF casualties approached, and in some cases exceeded 50 per cent for slight gains.|$|E
25|$|Once buffalo were located, hunting did {{not begin}} until the tribal priests {{considered}} the time propitious. The hunt began by the men stealthily advancing together toward the buffalo, {{but no one could}} kill any buffalo until the warriors of the tribe gave the signal, in order not to startle the animals before the hunters <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> position for the attack on the herd. Anyone who broke ranks could be severely beaten. During the chase, the hunters guided their ponies with their knees and wielded bows and arrows. They could incapacitate buffalo with a single arrow shot into the flank between the lower ribs and the hip. The animal would soon lie down and perhaps bleed out, or the hunters would finish it off. An individual hunter might shoot as many as five buffalo in this way before backtracking and finishing them off. They preferred to kill cows and young bulls, as the taste of older bulls was disagreeable.|$|E

25|$|The Kop Corner {{is a small}} filling section {{which is}} adjoined to the Main Spion Kop. It is the second largest area of the ground to remain uncovered, after the North West Corner. This corner is usually just {{referred}} to {{as part of the}} Spion Kop, as is its capacity, and it is rare to see it referred to as a separate area. The Kop Corner was a lot larger before the installation of the Spion Kop roof in 1986, but a crane was needed to lift the roof, and the Kop Corner was destroyed so the crane <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in.</b> Part of the corner was rebuilt, which is the present day area. Seats were installed in 1993 to correspond with the Taylor report, as was the rest of the Kop. This area was to be extended, and fully filled in under Sheffield Wednesday's ground renovation plans. The corner is well known amongst Wednesdayites as the location of Paul Gregory, aka 'Tango Man' on match days, along with his 'Wolverhampton Owls' flag and {{is often referred to as}} 'Tango's corner' by the Wednesdayites.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the reasons}} cited for Henry's {{impressive}} play up front {{is his ability to}} calmly score from one-on-ones. According to his father Antoine, Henry picked up his precision shooting from watching his idol Marco van Basten. He was also influenced by Romário, Ronaldo and African star George Weah, a new breed of strikers in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal. At his physical peak from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, Henry's ability to dribble past opponents with exceptional pace, skill and composure, meant that he <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> behind defenders regularly enough to score. In 2004, former Arsenal striker Alan Smith commented on Henry: [...] "I have to say I haven't seen a player like him. He's an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best." ...|$|E
500|$|Author J.

He added that Madonna's sober voice made the track [...] "as close to an old Motown production as a hit <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the dance-music-driven eighties." [...] Author Maury Dean in his book, Rock 'n' Roll Gold Rush, called the song [...] "echoey boogie" [...] with [...] "saucy-style and come-hither magnetism." [...] Author Rikky Rooksby in his book, The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, called it harmonically the most complex track of her debut album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called the song effervescent. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song soulful. Commentator Dave Marsh in his book, The Heart of Rock & Soul, said that the [...] "music's too damn good to be denied, no matter whose value system it disrupts." [...] Journalist Roxanne Orgill in her book, Shout, Sister, Shout!, commented that [...] "Borderline" [...] was the song which made Madonna the star she is. Thom Duffy of Orlando Sentinel commented that [...] "Borderline" [...] was a song that [...] "introduced Madonna, the helium-induced pop star, and a siren kitten." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} years of war saw the Royal Navy's battleships and battlecruisers {{regularly}} [...] "sweep" [...] the North Sea making sure that no German ships <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> or out. Only a few German surface ships that were already at sea, such as the famous light cruiser , were able to raid commerce. Even some of those that did manage to get out were hunted down by battlecruisers, as in the Battle of the Falklands, December 7, 1914. The results of sweeping actions in the North Sea were battles such as the Heligoland Bight and Dogger Bank and German raids on the English coast, all of which were attempts by the Germans to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet in an attempt to defeat the Royal Navy in detail. On May 31, 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on German terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the Battle of Jutland. The German fleet withdrew to port after two short encounters with the British fleet. Less than two months later, the Germans once again attempted to draw portions of the Grand Fleet into battle. The resulting Action of 19 August 1916 proved inconclusive. This reinforced German determination not to engage in a fleet to fleet battle.|$|E
500|$|When {{the episode}} aired, the {{production}} team received [...] "very few" [...] complaints about its content, {{with most of}} the response being positive. Alan Frutkin gave the episode a positive write-up in the LGBT-interest magazine The Advocate, calling it [...] "vintage Simpsons." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood stated in their book, I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, that: [...] "Only The Simpsons could do this so tongue-in-cheek that nobody <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> a tizzy about it. Very good indeed." [...] In the book Leaving Springfield, Matthew Henry praised the episode's critiquing of [...] "the most common misconception about homosexuality: namely that gayness is somehow contagious", as well as its other themes. Catharine Lumby of the University of Sydney cited the episode as an example of good satire as it [...] "managed to explore a lot of [...] issues in quite a deep way [...] without being overtly political", which she claimed, along with the episode's humor, made its anti-homophobia message more successful than that of other gay-themed shows like Queer as Folk. In his review of The Simpsons – The Complete Eighth Season DVD, Todd Gilchrist said that [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] "certainly qualifies as one of the all-time greatest episodes".|$|E
500|$|The Rhodesians {{were then}} summoned {{back out into}} the main lounge, where Kissinger insisted that their prime {{minister}} sit next to him. [...] "Ian Smith made accepting the deal worse by acting like a gentleman," [...] the American later said. Vorster opened the discussion by announcing that he had applied no pressure to the Rhodesian delegates, which caused further consternation amongst the Rhodesians which they had difficulty suppressing. It was agreed that the Rhodesians should return to Salisbury and consult their cabinet, then announce their answer. Despite expressing [...] "incredulity" [...] at what had happened in Pretoria, and showing deep reluctance, the politicians in Salisbury resolved that despite what they perceived as [...] "South African treachery" [...] the responsible course of action could only be to go on with the peace process, and that meant accepting Kissinger's terms, which they agreed were better than any they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the future should they refuse. Smith announced his government's answer on the evening of 24 September 1976: [...] "Yes." [...] South Africa's wavering financial and military assistance suddenly became available again, but the Frontline States then abruptly changed tact and turned the Kissinger terms down, saying that any interim period before majority rule was unacceptable. A new constitutional conference in Geneva, Switzerland was hastily organised by Britain to try to salvage something from the wreckage, with 20 October 1976 set as the start date.|$|E

500|$|In April 1994, {{the label}} {{arranged}} her {{to fly to}} London and meet with producer Tom Bailey. They recorded the songs [...] "I Want You", [...] "Fly" [...] and [...] "Just Like Honey", which was later re-recorded by Keith Fernley of Bailey's group Babble with {{a different set of}} lyrics and became the song [...] "Father's Field". Lords used lyrics she had previously written in New Zealand based on her personal journals she kept since she was a child. After finishing her recording with Bailey, Lords wanted something with a harder edge to add another dimension to her album. She was introduced to producer Ben Watkins of the electronic group Juno Reactor and decided to incorporate more rave sound. Mainly inspired by the music she would hear at warehouse parties during her stay in London, Lords teamed up with American singer Wonder with whom she created the lyrics to the song [...] "Control". Lords later commented on the inspiration behind the album's sound: [...] "It was in England that I fell in love with techno music. I was working in the UK doing some modelling a couple of years ago, and I was sharing a flat with some other girls in South London. We were really broke, and the cheapest place to go and have a good night out were raves - you <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> for about three bucks. So I went to a lot of raves and clubs, and I {{fell in love with the}} music - it was something that wasn't happening in the States at the time." [...] Lords recorded three more songs with Watkins; [...] "Good-N-Evil", [...] "Outlaw Lover" [...] and [...] "Fallen Angel".|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} Carey Meyer {{built the}} ship Serenity {{in two parts}} (one for each level) as a complete set with ceilings and practical lighting installed {{as part of the}} set that the cameras could use along with moveable parts. The two-part set also allowed the second unit to shoot in one section while the actors and first unit worked undisturbed in the other. As Whedon recalled: [...] "...you could pull it away or move something huge, so that you <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> and around everything. That meant the environment worked for us and there weren't a lot of adjustments that needed to be made." [...] There were other benefits to this set design. One was that it allowed the viewers to feel they were really in a ship. For Whedon, the design of the ship was crucial in defining the known space for the viewer, and that there were not [...] "fourteen hundred decks and a holodeck and an all-you-can-eat buffet in the back". He wanted to convey that it was utilitarian and that it was [...] "beat-up but lived-in and ultimately, it was home". As Joss Whedon discusses in the DVD commentary, each room represented a feeling or character, usually conveyed by the paint color. He explains that as you move {{from the back of the}} ship in the engine room, toward the front of the ship to the bridge, the colors and mood progress from extremely warm to cooler. Besides evoking a mood associated with the character who spends most time in each area, the color scheme also alludes to the heat generated in the tail of the ship.|$|E

2500|$|At a {{time when}} teams {{literally}} owned their players for their entire careers, the players began demanding such basics as a minimum salary and a properly funded pension plan. While team owners were getting rich with sold out arenas game after game, players were earning a pittance and many needed summer jobs to make a living. Almost all of these men had {{no more than a}} high school education and had been playing hockey as a profession all their working life. Superstars in the 1950s earned less than $25,000 a year ($ in [...] dollars) and when their playing days were over, they had nothing to fall back on and had to accept whatever work they <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> order to survive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} {{became so}} tense that {{war with the}} United States seemed imminent. On April 22, 1914, on the initiative of Felix A.

Carothers wrote to Secretary William Jennings Bryan: [...] "As {{far as he was concerned}} we could keep Vera Cruz [...] and hold it so tight that not even water <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> to Huerta and [...] [...] [...] he could not feel any resentment". Whether trying to please the U.S. government or through the diplomatic efforts of Sommerfeld and Carothers, or maybe as a result of both, Villa stepped out from under Carranza’s stated foreign policy.|$|E
