5|$|GWA studies {{investigate}} the entire genome, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> methods that specifically test {{a small number}} of pre-specified genetic regions. Hence, GWAS is a non-candidate-driven approach, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> gene-specific candidate-driven studies. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants in DNA associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal.|$|E

By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E

Barbarians could be recruited directly, as individuals enrolled into regular regiments, or indirectly, as members of irregular foederati units transformed into regular regiments.|$|E
