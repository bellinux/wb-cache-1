50|$|Crane {{started his}} career with Sheffield Wednesday in 1999, and was {{promoted}} from the club's youth academy into the squad that summer. The 1999-2000 campaign would spell the end of Wednesday's stay in the Premier League, as well as this, Crane failed to make an appearance in England's top division for The Owls. In {{the next couple of}} seasons, Crane established himself as a first team player, and played apart in the club's next three seasons, which were all contested playing in the English First Division. Crane would be used in three positions for the Wednesday. His original position of playing as a defensive central midfield, was often mixed with using him as a centre back, and in some circumstances his height and frame were used as an advantage when his manager picked him as a makeshift centre forward. In the 2002-2003 season, Sheffield Wednesday were relegated from the First Division, along with Brighton & Hove Albion and local rivals Grimsby Town. Following the club's further demise down the English domestic football <b>ladder,</b> <b>Crane</b> decided to leave Hillsborough {{at the end of the}} season, and moved to sign for Grimsby on a free transfer, he would become the first new signing for manager Paul Groves for the 2003-04 season. after both clubs had been relegated in the previous season.|$|R
