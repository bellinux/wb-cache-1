5|$|Another habit {{the moth}} has {{in common with}} many {{butterflies}} is the night resting posture—the wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they roost in a group for the night. The moth flies over the crown of trees and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100m (300ft), it then falls, inert and wings <b>closed,</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E
5|$|The Art Deco Tropicana, once a {{very popular}} lido on the beach, has {{suffered}} years of neglect. It <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public in 2000, and despite a number of attempts to reopen it, permission was given to demolish it in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The caverns <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public {{due to the}} Lebanese {{civil war}} in 1978 both tunnels leading to the lower and upper {{galleries}} were used to store munitions, the outside buildings for military purposes.

5|$|Within {{the abbey}} wall, but <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public, is the abbey retreat house, {{which is now}} used by the Diocese of Bath and Wells. The Tudor Gothic house was built between 1829 and 1830 by John Buckler from the stones of the abbey ruins for John Fry Reeves. It was altered and {{extended}} between 1850 and 1860, with further alterations in 1957.|$|E
5|$|According to Moberly and Jourdain, the {{two women}} decided to visit the Palace of Versailles as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they {{travelled}} by train to Versailles. They did not think much of the palace after touring it, {{so they decided to}} walk through the gardens to the Petit Trianon. On the way, they reached the Grand Trianon and found it was <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public.|$|E

5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps of the Capitol to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E
5|$|Downing Street leads off the {{south-west}} end of Whitehall, {{just above}} Parliament Street. It {{was named after}} Sir George Downing, who built a row of houses along the street around 1680 leading west from Whitehall. Following a number of terrorist attacks, the road was <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public in 1990, when security gates were erected at both ends. On 7 February 1991, the Provisional IRA fired mortars from a van parked in Whitehall towards No.10, one of which exploded in the gardens.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the Weymouth Corporation {{purchased}} the castle {{for the town}} from the Department of Woods and Forests {{for a total of}} £150. During the Second World War the castle probably housed an anti-aircraft battery as part of the defences created around Portland Harbour. Despite the construction of the Portland breakwaters nearby, the unstable clay cliffs remained vulnerable to erosion; in 1930 the ruins were <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public due to safety concerns and the remaining embrasure of the gun platform collapsed during in the 1950s.|$|E

The Center is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation an, as of 2014, has one full-time employee.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while Western Allies entered western Germany and <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rhine river. By March, the Western Allies {{crossed the}} Rhine {{north and south}} of the Ruhr, {{encircling}} the German Army Group B, while the Soviets advanced to Vienna. In early April, the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while Soviet and Polish forces stormed Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in November 2004 {{engineers}} identified {{cracks in}} the terrace supporting the Memorial Gardens, and they were <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public as a potential hazard. Eventually in 2009 work began on renovating the gardens. Lutyens's memorial was dismantled and cleaned, and reassembled {{at a higher level}} to be visible from the street; it was also rotated 180° to face City Hall, rather than the market. The terrace was strengthened, and the gardens were landscaped around a new sculpture by Paul de Monchaux on the original site of the memorial.|$|E

5|$|Reproductive {{rights to}} the {{painting}} were acquired by Zagreb merchant Petar Nikolić shortly after its creation, and lithographic prints were published soon thereafter. The painting was owned by the French Gallery until 1893, when it was purchased by a London buyer. In 1935, the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs purchased the work {{and gave it to}} the National Museum of Serbia, in whose possession it remains. It is classified under inventory number 31–115. The museum has been <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public since the early 2000s, pending renovation. This has not kept Jovanović's works, including Decorating of the Bride, from being displayed at other venues, including the National Museum's foyer, which is sometimes open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The Naag temple is a Sikh temple {{built by}} Chand Kaur, {{the wife of}} Kharak Singh who {{was the son of}} the then ruling Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

5|$|The Prospect Park Zoo <b>closed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{public in}} June 1988. Over {{the next six}} months, new homes were found for the {{displaced}} animals in other zoos throughout the US. Demolition was managed by the Parks Department and began in June 1989, commencing what became nearly a five-year, $37 million effort, overrunning initial estimates by two years and $19 million. The exteriors of the Aymar Embury buildings were preserved, but badly deteriorated interiors were gutted, pits and cages were demolished, and new structures were built.

5|$|The {{receiver}} {{offered the}} barn to Hillingdon Council and English Heritage for £1, but both refused the offer. Instead, a Gibraltar-based company calling itself Harmondsworth Barn Ltd bought the barn.

Such compensation would be paid should the land be required and the property demolished, although the barn fell just slightly outside the area required for a new runway.
