40|$|Several {{experiments}} {{for heat}} generation in composting process with livestock and farmyard wastes {{had been made}} by using a <b>compost</b> <b>container</b> in laboratory scale. Following the previously proposed procedure for estimation, the apparent rate of heat generation was calculated by applying the observed value of temperature in a compost bed to the analytical solution of temperature derived from a three dimensional model for heat conduction problem. The true (or total) rate of heat generation was also calculated by adding the latent heat loss due to vaporization of water to the apparent rate of heat generation. The following results were obtained. 1) Since the initial moisture content was relatively small, the increasing rate of temperature became large and the attainable maximum temperature was high in the early stage of the composting process. Because of the leakage of heat from the side walls of the <b>compost</b> <b>container</b> to the atmosphere, however, temperature decreased within a comparatively short period. 2) During the composting process, the effective region of heat generation moved gradually downward {{from the surface of the}} compost bed, so that the apparent rate of heat generation was varied remarkably with both the time and the vertical location in the compost bed. 3) As for some results of the experiments used relatively large contents of rice bran and chicken manure (Runs 3, 4), the steady high-temperature period became longer and the local maximum value of the apparent rate of heat generation was larger than the results of the other experiments (Runs 1, 2). Even in the latter experiments, in the limited region of the effective duration of heat generation, the average value of the apparent rate of heat generation in the compost bed was approximately 150 kcal/m 3 hr, and this value was not so different from the results of the former experiments. 4) The above-mentioned results on the average value of the apparent rate of heat generation were also similar to the results of the previous experiments under the considerably larger moisture conditions. As for a natural composting process, the average of the apparent rate of heat generation in the effective region of heat generation seemed to be almost independent of the moisture content and to fall within the range from 150 to 200 kcal/m 3 hr. 5) The calculated results of the true (or total) rate of heat generation agreed well with the values estimated from the consumption rate of carbon in the compost bed, and were almost equal to the results which had been obtained previously...|$|E

The fiber netting can be impregnated with insecticides {{such as the}} synthetic pyrethroid deltamethrin that acts rapidly when flies such as Stomoxys or Glossina species land on it. Valuable horses in areas infested with Culicoides midges or Simulium black-flies can be protected with commercially available shields made of cloth that fit over head, neck and back. Flies such as the Musca, Stomoxys and Haematobia species have larval habitats amongst livestock dung and soiled bedding found around livestock farms.

However, for many types of dipteran fly the larvae inhabit areas such as bogs (Culicoides), swamps (mosquitoes), or rivers (Simulium) that are impractical to treat under typical commercial constraints within agriculture.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of extracting heat from a natural process of decomposition. Located in PlanteLaboratoriet at Nørrebro {{and based on the}} principles of recycling, sustainability and living technology, a group of people have set up an aquaponic system, in which fish and plants grow in an interdependent cycle. However, the system faces several issues in which cold winters are one of the more substantial, as the system require a certain temperature. With the specific aquaponic system in PlanteLaboratoriet in mind, we have an initial presumption of the potential in heat composting as a power source. Through experiments, a french inventor named Jean Pain, created a huge compost pile, which produced massive amounts of heat. In this paper, we wish to find out if this technique can be applied in a smaller scale in an urban environment with the aim of creating a warm, green spot of life in the grey cold city. Through a practice oriented approach, we have explored several different designs of urban <b>compost</b> <b>containers.</b> In this design process and through a number of experiments, we have learned, that you can in fact extract a noticeable amount of heat from a compost compound, though constraints remain due to the limiting conditions a city provides...|$|R
40|$|Problems as {{a result}} of {{inadequate}} sanitation are the root to spreading of many diseases and the loss of several millions of lives every year. Therefore a Norwegian organization, Sustainable Sanitation Design, is trying out methods for having human feces sanitized in a sustainable way. In this trial, the safety and efficiency of composting human feces with a special composting method, called the Howard-Higgins method were investigated. The method claims to sanitize source separated feces in 90 days and to test that statement six <b>compost</b> <b>containers</b> were set up. To control that the composting process reached the heat necessary for sanitization the temperature was controlled frequently. Volatile solids, pH and the dry substance fraction were also controlled to measure Howard-Higgins method’s efficiency. By measuring fecal indicators Enterococcus feacalis initially and in {{the very end of the}} process, the statement of sanitization was controlled.  The results from the measuring of fecal indicators showed a very varied result. Some of the compost nearly reached the limits for pathogens set up by the WHO. The most successful compost ended up with 3. 9 LOG 10 reduction, which only 0. 1 LOG 10 below WHO’s definition of sanitization for excreta that is to be used as fertilizer. The least successful compost had only a 1. 6 LOG 10 reduction. None of the compost became warm enough to sanitize pathogens. The method is because of its complicity and uncertainty not recommended to be used by Sustainable Sanitation Design to sanitize human feces. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The {{primary goal}} of this {{dissertation}} research {{was to assess the}} use of compost for the control of several foliar and soil borne diseases commercially important in the Pacific Northwest. The use of compost teas to control of gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) on geraniums, powdery mildew (Podosphearapannosa var. rosae), rust (Phragmidium spp.), and black spot (Diplocarpon rosae) on field grown roses, and damping-off caused by Pythiurn ultimum was examined. The goal was to optimize control through manipulation of compost tea production parameters of compost source, fermentation nutrients, fermentation duration, stirring, depth of liquid, aeration, and spray adjuvants. No one optimal set of compost tea production practices could be determined for control of grey mold, however, empirical evidence indicated that the probability of disease suppression could be increased through compost tea production choices, especially compost source and addition of fermentation nutrients. Incorporating <b>compost</b> into <b>container</b> media resulted in variable suppression of seedling damping-off across compost sources.

They are {{slightly larger than}} a flush toilet, but use roughly the same floor space. Some units use fans for aeration, and optionally, heating elements to maintain optimum temperatures to hasten the composting process and to evaporate urine and other moisture. Operators of composting toilets commonly add {{a small amount of}} absorbent carbon material (such as untreated sawdust, coconut coir, peat moss) after each use to create air pockets to encourage aerobic processing, to absorb liquid and to create an odor barrier.

50|$|Certain {{ratios of}} these {{materials}} will provide beneficial bacteria with the nutrients {{to work at a}} rate that will heat up the pile. In that process much water will be released as vapor ("steam"), and the oxygen will be quickly depleted, explaining the need to actively manage the pile. The hotter the pile gets, the more often added air and water is necessary; the air/water balance is critical to maintaining high temperatures (135°-160° Fahrenheit / 50° - 70° Celsius) until the materials are broken down. At the same time, too much air or water also slows the process, as does too much carbon (or too little nitrogen). Hot <b>container</b> <b>composting</b> focuses on retaining the heat to increase decomposition rate and produce compost more quickly.|$|R
40|$|In the  April of 2007, pseudomyiasis was {{detected}} in alimentary tract {{of two years}} old boy from South Moravia (Czech Republic).

5000|$|Hot <b>container</b> <b>composting</b> (also {{referred}} to as in-vessel composting for larger industrial batches) is different to cold composting, in that compost is created without losing valuable heat. Heat loss {{is the reason why}} a compost pile takes so long to decompose. Observers have noted that the time taken to create compost can be dramatically reduced by retaining the heat in a suitably insulated container. Another observation noted is the way the compostable items are added and mixed which allows for aeration. This is an important step in the process. Compost becomes [...] due to the absence of air, and this can result in it becoming smelly. By adding large, medium and fine items {{to the top of the}} container, space is provided in between the items for the air to flow from bottom to top. This creates a trickle ventilation. Compost made with this method is called [...] composting (no smell).|$|R
40|$|Four {{commercial}} composts {{were added}} to soil to study their effect on plant growth, total rhizosphere microflora, and incidence of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in the rhizosphere of tomato plants. Three of the compost treatments significantly improved plant growth, while one compost treatment significantly depressed it. Compost amendments caused only small variations in the total numbers of bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi in the rhizosphere of tomato plants. A total of 709 bacteria were isolated from the four compost treatments and the soil control to determine the percentage of PGPR in each treatment. The PGPR tests measured antagonism to soilborne root pathogens, production of indoleacetic acid, cyanide, and siderophores, phosphate solubilization, and intrinsic resistance to antibiotics. Our {{results show that the}} addition of some composts to soil increased the incidence in the tomato rhizosphere of bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, Pyrenochaeta lycopersici, Pythium ultimum, and Rhizoctonia solani. The antagonistic effects observed were associated with marked increases in the percentage of siderophore producers. No significant differences were observed in the percentage of cyanogens, whereas the percentages of phosphate solubilizers and indoleacetic acid producers were affected, respectively, by one and two compost treatments. Intrinsic resistance to antibiotics was only marginally different among the rhizobacterial populations. Our results suggest that compost may stimulate the proliferation of antagonists in the rhizosphere and confirm previous reports indicating that the use of <b>composts</b> in <b>container</b> media has the potential to protect plants from soilborne root pathogens...|$|R

40|$|For {{farmers in}} dry areas, it is {{sometimes}} hard to keep solvent. George Kasimo, from Kitui district, Eastern Kenya, took his spade and developed his own way of intensive vegetable farming, growing onions, cabbages and tomatoes and selling them on the local market. Kasimo started his garden because the local community faces food shortages during the dry season, when prices of vegetables from the nearby town are high. Choosing a plot close to a riverbed, Kasimo subdivided his garden into many smaller raised beds about 15 cms high, 11 / 2 m wide and 6 m long. Raised beds, shaped by digging deep to raise the soil, have good soil texture and drainage properties, temperature regulation is optimal and weeding requirements are limited. The raised soil is then slightly compacted and sprinkled with water to make the soil firm. Before the soil dries, square holes measuring about 10 15 cm wide and 20 cm deep are carefully made, using a plastic <b>container.</b> <b>Compost</b> is then added in each hole and the bed is left to dry completely for one day. Before transplanting vegetable seedlings into the holes, some water is put in to them. This gives enough moisture for the new seedlings to start growing. After planting, each hole is mulched using grass. The holes are watered once a week, thus conserving water. The plant canopy limits the undergrowth of weeds and also reduces evaporation from the soil. Finally, manure is applied very efficiently, since it is put directly where the crops roots are. In a good season Kasimo is able to sell US$ 295 (310) worth of vegetables from a plot of less than 1 / 8 acre (500 m 2).
