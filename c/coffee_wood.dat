40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the production of cedar wood in agroforestry systems (AF) with coffee, using a prediction model of the commercial volume obtained in the study area, as well as the profitability generated by the sale of <b>coffee,</b> <b>wood</b> and payment for environmental services (PPSA). The study was carried out in the canton of Pérez Zeledón, province of San José, Costa Rica. There were established 30 temporary sampling plots of 1000 m 2 in AF with cedar between five and 17 years of age. The diameter growth (DBH) and the commercial height (CH) of the species were evaluated, as well as the management of the SAF (activities, inputs and yields) and coffee production through the producer interview. The obtained models allowed to predict the commercial volume (m 3 tree- 1) according to age (R 2 = 88. 7 %), DBH (R 2 = 90. 3 %) and CH (R 2 = 97. 2 %). The average coffee production of the sampled sites was 26 fanegas ha- 1 year- 1. At the age of 17 years of the cedar, a production of 1. 04 m 3 tree- 1 (92. 13 m 3 ha- 1) of standing timber was obtained, which represented a financial contribution of 81 % of the net present value (NPV) of the AF in the analysis period. The estimated financial indicators allow concluding that the coffee-cedar AF is profitable since it generated a positive NPV of ₡ 8 198 601, 5, an internal rate of return (IRR) of 16 % which was higher than the cost of money (discount rate of 6. 1 %) and a B/C ratio of 1. 34...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{ascertain}} fuelwood value at rural and peri-urban households, provincial and national levels; explore the notion of fuelwood as a gender concern, and establish fuelwood scarcity indicators. It contains 179 pages, six chapters, 64 graphs, 9 tables; a reference list and an appendix which includes the summary of the household survey, questionnaire and the list of surveyors. This study {{is based on a}} semi-structured stratified survey of 401 rural ‘Village’ and peri-urban squatter ‘Settlement’ households, field observations of five provinces and a literature review. The survey localities are the three villages of Aligaiyufa, Oiyafaiyufa and Masumabe and 45 ‘blocks’ within the Kama Settlement. All the survey localities are approximately 8 km south of Goroka town in the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea. The study established that wood is the primary energy source for 100 % of households, complemented with kerosene and electricity. The three most used and preferred wood species are Casuarina oligodon (yar) Coffea arabica (coffee) and Albizzia chinensis (marmar). The three most important collection sources are coffee gardens, river banks and general bush with river banks, coffee gardens and coffee plantations being the most intensively used. Wood collection is conducted 2 - 3 times a week with each wood load lasting 2 - 3 days. <b>Coffee</b> <b>wood</b> from plantations and small holder gardens form an important wood source for both ‘Village’ and squatter ‘Settlement’ households. Gendered differentiation in wood collection, species preferences, wood purchases and perceptions are not markedly defined. A combination of direct and indirect valuation methods were utilised to calculate the fuelwood consumption of households in the study area. Based on the direct market value of Casuarina wood sold at the Mt Hagen market, the quantity of purchased fuelwood per household (household size of 4. 2 persons) is 3, 640 kg valued at PGK 728. 00 annually. Based on this market value and not accounting for other determinants of fuelwood scarcity, the quantity of wood required for the 14, 433 rural households in the Eastern Highlands province is 52 million kg valued at K 10. 5 million annually. In reality though, the study found that only 5 % of households purchased wood. Of the 5 % of households who purchased wood, over 60 % purchased once a week, spending K 2. 00 for each purchase. Therefore based on the market value of wood, the potion of the rural population in the EHP purchasing wood once a week, equates to only 721 households that purchased 374, 920 kg of wood valued at K 74, 984. 00. The study also established that households spend up to a total of 8 hours or the equivalent of a day per week on wood collection. Two ‘day values’ were determined by the study. The first ‘day value’ of K 5. 00 was derived from the 1992 national minimum rural weekly wage rate of K 24. 20. The second ‘day value’ is based on the income from coffee which ranged from K 7. 00 to K 15. 00 /week. Annually each household spends an equivalent of 52 days in fuelwood collection. This equates to K 260. 00 /household/year based on the ‘day value’ of K 5. 00 or K 140. 00 - K 300. 00 /household/year based on the ‘day value’ derived from coffee income. Using the average of the ‘day values’ of K 233. 33, the national value of ‘days spent on fuelwood collecting’ for the 754, 909 rural households in PNG is around K 9, 146 million (US$ 2, 926 million). The per capita consumption is 866. 7 kg per year. The national fuelwood consumption, based on the market price of fuelwood, is K 550 mill (US$ 176 million) for 2. 75 million tons of wood annually. However, because only 5 % of households buy wood; the market based wood economy nationally is worth K 3. 9 million. Combined with the value of collected wood the most likely value of the fuelwood use in PNG is K 9, 150 million (US$ 2, 928 million). The study recommended that establishing people’s perceptions is the fundamental indicator of fuelwood scarcities followed by other indicators such as times and distances, substitution for lesser fuels, blurring of gendered lines and accessibility of fuelwood/biomass resources...|$|E

40|$|There exists {{already a}} {{considerable}} market for many biomass based products (food, <b>coffee,</b> cotton, <b>wood,</b> paper, energy (pellets), etc). This paper analyses {{the possibilities of}} partly solving several global problems like poverty in mainly rural areas and problems linked to the world energy supply by an increased use of biomass; this without jeopardizing the world food supply. Energy crops will influence the prices of the present market of crops. Prices of, for instance, coffee or cotton will increase. Higher prices create room for investment (e. g. fertilizer) and this way yields will go up and less land is needed. So the future market {{will be determined by}} two main products: energy crops and crops for other purposes. A choice has to be made: producing crops for energy or for other purposes. In this paper this is called a 2 ̆ 2 two products philosophy 2 ̆ 2. All farmers and agro-business companies will benefit from this development. However, this promise holds especially for Developing Countries; Brazil is a convincing example. Of course in practise the two products are often combined; both products will for instance be produced during the processing of biomass. These possibilities are elaborated in bio refinery concepts. The environment will also benefit from this development. There is a central role for governments and international organisations to guide this development in a sustainable way; a stimulating policy is needed. Otherwise, it will not lead to a socially sustainable development with poverty elevation. As examples of new energy products entering the market, two developments are described: the production of Fischer-Tropsch oil and bio oil from Jatropha. It is concluded that the evolving energy market creates a complete new, stimulating situation for the production of crops, both in Industrialized and Developing Countries...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{physical}} characteristics of wood {{are not usually}} taken into account when breeding perennial species grown for their fruits or seeds. In the coffee tree, stem breakage during harvesting and lodging during the growth period are major defects in some cultivars. Such defects are linked to certain wood physical and mechanical properties, such as density or rigidity, which can be characterized by a parameter used in the resistance of materials: the modulus of elasticity. Wood density and the longitudinal modulus of elasticity of stem segments of Coffea arabica L and C. canephora coffee trees were studied. C. arabica coffee trees derived from a diallel mating design, and C. canephora derived from a clone comparative trial. The modulus of elasticity was measured using an acoustic system based on {{an analysis of the}} vibrations produced by a blow {{to the end of a}} piece of wood of known geometry. The modulus of elasticity and the wood density of the coffee tree stems were highly heritable in both species and the wood from C. arabica was stiffer on average than that from C. canephora. C. canephora clone classification according to wood stiffness revealed the clones most liable to lodging. In this species, wood stiffness displayed strong broad sense heritability (0. 64), indicating that this trait can be efficiently improved. This parameter could also be used as a predictor of other traits of agronomic interest, such as resistance to borer insects. The classification of C. arabica parents according to the wood characteristics of their progenies depended on their rate of introgression by the species C. canephora. These traits could therefore be used as a measure of introgression in this species. Use of <b>coffee</b> tree <b>wood</b> could also be considered, notably to derive value from the wood arising from the different pruning and cutting back operations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work {{studies the}} {{influence}} of added inert dust on the ignition sensitivity of the combustible/inert dust mixture. Different types of combustible dust of various sizes, such as coal, powdered sugar, lycopodium, anthraquinone, rice and <b>coffee</b> husks, beech <b>wood</b> flour or ground coffee were mixed with alumina and kieselguhr before being tested. Parameters measured were 1) minimum ignition temperature (MIT) in 5 mm layer, 2) minimum ignition temperature in cloud (Godbert-Greenwald oven) and 3) minimum ignition energy (MIE) (in a Kühner-Mike 3 apparatus). It appears from this study that the MIT in 5 mm layer is strongly influenced by an inert fraction >= 60 % (weight). There is also {{a significant increase in}} MIT in cloud form when the fraction of inert dust exceeds 60 % (weight). This threshold {{is a function of the}} bulk density of the inert substance selected for these tests. However, in cases where the density of the inert dust is different from that of the combustible dust, there appears to be a separation of the two constituents of the mixture after its pneumatic dispersion during the test.
