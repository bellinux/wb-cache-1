2500|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus can cause microcephaly, microphthalmus (abnormally small eyeballs), retinal {{dysplasia}}, hepatosplenomegaly, and mental retardation. [...] Both microphthalmus and retinal dysplasia can cause blindness. [...] However, the most common symptom in infants is an inflammatory response that develops {{during the first three}} weeks of life. [...] Hyperthermia causes anencephaly, which is when part of the brain and skull are absent in the infant. [...] Mother exposure to toxoplasmosis can cause cerebral calcification, hydrocephalus (causes mental disabilities), and mental retardation in infants. [...] Other birth abnormalities have been reported as well, such as <b>chorioretinitis,</b> microphthalmus, and ocular defects. [...] Syphilis causes congenital deafness, mental retardation, and diffuse fibrosis in organs, such as the liver and lungs, if the embryo is exposed.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{infectious}} agents include cytomegalovirus, the {{herpes simplex}} virus, hyperthermia, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis. [...] Mother exposure to cytomegalovirus can cause microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, blindness, <b>chorioretinitis</b> (which can cause blindness), hepatosplenomegaly, and meningoencephalitis in fetuses. [...] Microcephaly is a disorder {{in which the}} fetus has an atypically small head, cerebral calcifications means {{certain areas of the}} brain have atypical calcium deposits, and meningoencephalitis is the enlargement of the brain. [...] All three disorders cause abnormal brain function or mental retardation. [...] Hepatosplenomegaly is the enlargement of the liver and spleen which causes digestive problems. [...] It can also cause some kernicterus and petechiae. [...] Kernicterus causes yellow pigmentation of the skin, brain damage, and deafness. [...] Petechaie is when the capillaries bleed resulting in red/purple spots on the skin. [...] However, cytomegalovirus is often fatal in the embryo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chorioretinitis</b> {{is often}} caused by {{toxoplasmosis}} and cytomegalovirus infections (mostly seen in immunodeficient {{subjects such as}} people with HIV or on immunosuppressant drugs). Congenital toxoplasmosis via transplacental transmission {{can also lead to}} sequelae such as <b>chorioretinitis</b> along with hydrocephalus and cerebral calcifications. Other possible causes of <b>chorioretinitis</b> are syphilis, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, Behcet's disease, onchocerciasis, or West Nile virus. <b>Chorioretinitis</b> may also occur in presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS); despite its name, the relationship of POHS to Histoplasma is controversial.|$|E

50|$|Infants {{that are}} {{infected}} by the protozoanToxoplasma gondii in utero can be born with <b>chorioretinitis</b> or ocular toxoplasmosis. Globally, {{it is the}} most common cause of infections of the back of the eye. (posterior segment). The most common sign is decreased vision in one eye. Other signs and symptoms may appear after the neonatal period and include: miscarriage, stillbirth, <b>chorioretinitis</b> development later in life, intracranial calcification hydrocephalus or central nervous system abnormalities.|$|E
50|$|Ocular complications, though rare, {{are listed}} as optic atrophy, microphthalmia, {{pigmentary}} <b>chorioretinitis,</b> hemeralopia (decreased vision in bright light), myopia, strabismus, nystagmus and iris/retinal coloboma.|$|E

50|$|Though {{caused by}} {{different}} infections, {{the signs and}} symptoms of TORCH syndrome are consistent. They include hepatosplenomegaly (enlargement of the liver and spleen), fever, lethargy, difficulty feeding, anemia, petechiae, purpurae, jaundice, and <b>chorioretinitis.</b> The specific infection may cause additional symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Presumed ocular {{histoplasmosis}} syndrome (POHS) causes <b>chorioretinitis,</b> {{where the}} choroid and retina {{of the eyes}} are scarred, resulting {{in a loss of}} vision not unlike macular degeneration. Despite its name, the relationship to Histoplasma is controversial. Distinct from POHS, acute ocular histoplasmosis may rarely occur in immunodeficiency.|$|E
50|$|Another {{known cause}} {{is a rare}} genetic {{condition}} called Cohen Syndrome (aka Pepper Syndrome). Cohen syndrome is mostly characterized by obesity, mental retardation, and craniofacial dysmorphism due to genetic mutation at locus 8q22-23. Rarely it may have ocular complications such as hemeralopia, pigmentary <b>chorioretinitis,</b> optic atrophy or retinal/iris coloboma, having a serious effect on the person's vision.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chorioretinitis</b> is an {{inflammation}} of the choroid (thin pigmented vascular coat of the eye) and retina of the eye. It {{is a form of}} posterior uveitis. If only the choroid is inflamed, not the retina, the condition is termed choroiditis. The ophthalmologist's goal in treating these potentially blinding conditions is to eliminate the inflammation and minimize the potential risk of therapy to the patient.|$|E
50|$|Current teleophthalmological {{solutions}} are generally {{focused on a}} particular eye problem, such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, macular degeneration, strabismus and adnexal eye diseases. Less common conditions that can be revealed using retinal images are arterial and vein occlusions, <b>chorioretinitis,</b> congenital anomalies, and tapetoretinal abitrophy. Several population-based studies have used retinal imaging to relate ophthalmic abnormalities to general conditions, including hypertension, renal dysfunction, cardiovascular mortality, subclinical and clinical stroke, and cognitive impairment.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{recorded}} case of congenital toxoplasmosis was in 1923, {{but it was}} not identified as caused by T. gondii. Janků (1923) described in detail the autopsy results of an 11-month-old boy who had presented to hospital with hydrocephalus. The boy had classic marks of toxoplasmosis including <b>chorioretinitis</b> (inflammation of the choroid and retina of the eye). Histology revealed a number of [...] "sporocytes", though Janků did not identify these as T. gondii.|$|E
50|$|Dirksen {{continued}} to be re-elected. In 1947, he began to experience trouble in his right eye, which was diagnosed as <b>chorioretinitis.</b> Despite a number of physicians (including one from Johns Hopkins University) recommending for the eye to be removed, Dirksen chose treatment and rest; he recovered most of the sight in that eye. In 1948, he declined to run for re-election because of his ailment. He returned to politics two years later and was popularly elected to the Senate from Illinois.|$|E

[...] Although Grant was highly sought after for modeling at age 14, she stayed in school until age 16. [...] At age 16, while her mother underwent a series of eye surgeries, she served as her mother's eyes. Her mother had <b>chorioretinitis</b> and could not even recognize Grant until she was 13. [...] Her parents are Tony and Regina Grant, {{and she has a}} younger brother.|$|E
50|$|Toxoplasma <b>chorioretinitis,</b> {{more simply}} known as ocular toxoplasmosis, is {{probably}} {{the most common cause of}} infections in the back of the eye (posterior segment) worldwide. The causitive agent is Toxoplasma gondii, and in the United States, most cases are acquired congenitally. The most common symptom is decreased visual acuity in one eye. The diagnosis is made by examination of the eye, using ophthalmoscopy. Sometimes serologic testing is used to rule out the disease, but due to high rates of false positives, serologies are not diagnostic of toxoplasmic retinitis.|$|E
50|$|In the US {{corticotropin}} is used {{to treat}} epileptic spasms in infants, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults; acute episodes of psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis; in acute exacerbations or as maintenance therapy for the collagen disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic dermatomyositis; for skin conditions like severe erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome; for serum sickness; for severe acute and chronic allergic and inflammatory processes involving the eye such as keratitis, iritis, iridocyclitis, diffuse posterior uveitis, choroiditis, optic neuritis, <b>chorioretinitis,</b> and anterior segment inflammation; sarcoidosis in the lungs; and to treat edema in certain nephrotic syndromes.|$|E
50|$|Congenital {{toxoplasmosis}} is {{a specific}} form of toxoplasmosis in which an unborn fetus is infected via the placenta. Congenital toxoplasmosis is associated with fetal death and abortion, and in infants, it is associated with neurologic deficits, neurocognitive deficits, and <b>chorioretinitis.</b> A positive antibody titer indicates previous exposure and immunity, and largely ensures the unborn fetus' safety. A simple blood draw at the first prenatal doctor visit can {{determine whether or not}} a woman has had previous exposure and therefore whether or not she is at risk. If a woman receives her first exposure to T. gondii while pregnant, the fetus is at particular risk.|$|E
50|$|T. gondii {{was first}} {{identified}} as a human pathogen in 1939. Wolf, Cowen and Paige identified T. gondii infection in an infant girl delivered full-term by Caesarean section. The infant developed seizures and had <b>chorioretinitis</b> in both eyes at three days. The infant then developed encephalomyelitis and died at one month of age. Wolf, Cowen and Paige isolated T. gondii from brain tissue lesions. Intracranial injection of brain and spinal cord samples into mice, rabbits and rats produced encephalitis in the animals. Wolf, Cowen and Page reviewed additional cases and concluded that T. gondii produced recognizable symptoms and could be transmitted from mother to child.|$|E
5000|$|Lymphocytic choriomeningitis is a {{particular}} concern in obstetrics, as vertical transmission is known to occur. For immunocompetent mothers, {{there is no significant}} threat, but the virus has damaging effects upon the fetus. If infection occurs during the first trimester, LCMV results in an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Later congenital infection may lead to malformations such as intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus, microcephaly or macrocephaly, intellectual disabilities, and seizures. Other findings include chorioretinal scars, and optic atrophy. <b>Chorioretinitis,</b> which is followed by chorioretinal scarring, is the most common ocular lesion. [...] Mortality among infants is approximately 30%. Among the survivors, two thirds have lasting neurologic abnormalities.|$|E
5000|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus can cause microcephaly, microphthalmus (abnormally small eyeballs), retinal {{dysplasia}}, hepatosplenomegaly, and mental retardation. [...] Both microphthalmus and retinal dysplasia can cause blindness. However, the most common symptom in infants is an inflammatory response that develops {{during the first three}} weeks of life. [...] Hyperthermia causes anencephaly, which is when part of the brain and skull are absent in the infant. [...] Mother exposure to toxoplasmosis can cause cerebral calcification, hydrocephalus (causes mental disabilities), and mental retardation in infants. Other birth abnormalities have been reported as well, such as <b>chorioretinitis,</b> microphthalmus, and ocular defects. Syphilis causes congenital deafness, mental retardation, and diffuse fibrosis in organs, such as the liver and lungs, if the embryo is exposed.|$|E
50|$|Other ocular defects {{including}} optic atrophy, microphthalmia, vitreitis, leukokoria and cataracts {{can also}} be seen. Most of the infants in one case series were of normal birth weight, although 30% were underweight. Aspiration pneumonia can be a fatal complication. Infants who survive may have severe neurological defects including epilepsy, impaired coordination, visual loss or blindness, spastic diplegia or quadriparesis/quadriplegia, delayed development and intellectual disability. Less severe cases with isolated cerebellar hypoplasia and symptoms of ataxia and jitteriness have been reported occasionally. There have also been rare cases with evidence of <b>chorioretinitis</b> but without neurological signs. Systemic signs seem to be rare, but hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia have been documented in a few cases, and skin blisters were reported in one infant.|$|E
50|$|Uveitis {{refers to}} {{a large group of}} {{disorders}} which cause inflammation within the eye. A similar condition, iritis, usually {{refers to a}}n inflammation involving the front structures of the eye associated with pain, redness, and sensitivity to light. In this discussion, uveitis could have these symptoms, but mainly consists of inflammation involving the back structures of the eye (the retina, choroid, and optic nerve). Inflammatory debris liberated into the vitreous leads to the visualization of floaters. If this liberation continues, the vision may become substantially hazy and blurred. There are numerous conditions leading to uveitis, and many have floaters and blurred vision as predominant symptoms: sarcoidosis, toxoplasmosis <b>chorioretinitis,</b> ocular histoplasmosis, multifocal choroiditis, pars planitis, endophalmitis, syphilis, candidiasis, viral uveitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome, and HIV related uveitis.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{infectious}} agents include cytomegalovirus, the {{herpes simplex}} virus, hyperthermia, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis. Mother exposure to cytomegalovirus can cause microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, blindness, <b>chorioretinitis</b> (which can cause blindness), hepatosplenomegaly, and meningoencephalitis in fetuses. [...] Microcephaly is a disorder {{in which the}} fetus has an atypically small head, cerebral calcifications means {{certain areas of the}} brain have atypical calcium deposits, and meningoencephalitis is the enlargement of the brain.

50|$|In June 1936, Hissette {{presented}} {{a slide show}} in London and became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicines and Hygiene. On 18 July 1936 he exhibited his aquarelles on the pathology of ocular onchocerciasis at the Colonial exhibition in Brussels (l’Institut royal colonial belge, l’actuelle Académie royale des Sciences d’Outre-mer) and also published them in the Collection des Mémoires de l’Institut (Hissette 1937). Amongst the aquarelles there is one picture of a typical <b>chorioretinitis</b> of the African ocular onchocerciasis, which creates blotchy scars (Hissette 1937, Hissette 1938). In 1937, he investigates the ocular complications of a measles epidemic in the colonial M’Pweto Region. Due to measles and a concurrent vitamin A deficiency spontaneous double-sided cornea perforations and blindness were caused in many children. At {{the beginning of the}} Second World War Hissette was appointed the position of the provincial doctor in Katanga. In 1952 he and his wife returned to Belgium. Around the same time he fell seriously ill and never really recovered from it, making it impossible for him to ever work in the medical field again. In the first few years the couple stayed in Lacuisine-sur-Semois but soon moved to an apartment in Brussels. Jean died in Brussels on 26 August 1965. He and his wife are buried in a family grave in Lacuisine, Florenville.|$|E
