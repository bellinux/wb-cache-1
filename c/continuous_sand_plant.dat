50|$|Between 1930 and 1955, the International Bitumen Company Limited under R.C. Fitzsimmons {{and later}} Lloyd Champion {{operated}} a small-scale oil <b>sands</b> <b>plant</b> at Bitumount, near Fort McMurray, Alberta.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, the Hungarian {{government}} {{planned to}} invest 2,850 million rupees (about USD24 million) for construction and supply of sophisticated machinery for a sea <b>sand</b> <b>plant</b> in Kalutara, Sri Lanka.|$|R
50|$|For oil <b>sand</b> <b>plants,</b> {{a mixture}} of oil sand and water may be pumped over a long {{distance}} to release the bitumen by ablation. These pipelines are also called hydrotransport pipelines.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant was}} down, but not out. In 1953 Lloyd Champion, who had {{acquired}} the plant during World War II began forming the Great Canadian Oil Sands consortium, {{based on his}} oil sands assets and his business acumen and drive. That effort lurched from crisis to crisis until Alberta Premier Ernest Manning brought his friend, J. Howard Pew, into the conversation. As the chairman of Philadelphia-based Sun Oil Company, Pew soon became the primary financial backer of the project. As a result, the Great Canadian Oil <b>Sands</b> <b>plant</b> (today the Suncor oil <b>sands</b> <b>plant)</b> went into operation in 1967 - the year of Canada's Centennial celebrations.|$|R

50|$|In 1967, the Great Canadian Oil <b>Sands</b> (now Suncor) <b>plant</b> {{opened and}} Fort McMurray's growth soon took off. More oil <b>sands</b> <b>plants</b> were opened up, {{especially}} after 1973 and 1979, when serious political tensions and {{conflicts in the}} Middle East triggered oil price spikes.

40|$|The {{ability of}} corals to {{withstand}} experimental sand deposition was investigated for two experimental periods (17 h and 6 wk) in eight scleractinia (Favia favus, Favites pentagona, Platygyra daedalea, Gyrosmilia interrupta, Galaxea fascicularis, Cyphastrea chalcidicum, Favites abdita, Goniopora dijboutensis) and five alcyonacea (Lobophytum depressum, L. venustum, Sinularia dura, S. leptoclados, Sarcophyton glaucum) collected in 1992 from Natal, South Africa. Scleractinia were active sediment shedders, alcyonacea passive, relying on water motion and gravity. Short-term sand clearing efficiency was primarily dependent on corallum shape. Sand application led to hydrostatic inflation of polyps in scleractinia {{and the entire}} colony in alcyonacea {{as well as to}} increased tentacular action in the scleractinian Gyrosmilia interrupta. Under <b>continuous</b> <b>sand</b> application, inflation remained while other activities, such as tentacular motion, ceased completely. In scleractinia and alcyonacea, tissue necroses appeared after the first week of <b>continuous</b> <b>sand</b> application. Death of entire colonies and partial bleaching of continually sandcovered areas were observed in alcyonacea only. Different grain sizes of sand had no influence on clearing reaction or efficiencies...|$|R

50|$|The system {{originally}} used {{a single}} pipe for water delivery, {{and did not}} have any water purification plants, relying instead on the reservoirs to act as settling basins. By the turn of the 20th century, however, Washington's growth and the high amount of sediment in the Potomac's water kept the reservoirs from doing their jobs well, and so the first treatment plant, a massive slow sand filter bed system, was installed at McMillan Reservoir, and was completed in 1905. The regular use of chlorine as a disinfectant began in 1923 at the McMillan plant. The McMillan plant was not replaced until 1985, when a rapid <b>sand</b> filter <b>plant</b> was opened adjacent to it. Efforts are under way to redevelop the land the slow <b>sand</b> <b>plant</b> used, while maintaining some of the <b>plant's</b> <b>sand</b> silos for historical purposes.|$|R

2500|$|The {{largest single}} plant in Canada {{to use in}} situ {{production}} is Imperial Oil's Cold Lake oil <b>sand</b> <b>plant.</b> This plant uses a technique called cyclic steam injection.

Imperial also uses steam-assisted gravity drainage. In its SAGD production system, Imperial drills two horizontal wells, one five metres above the other.
