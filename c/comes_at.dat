5|$|Tamil is a {{consistently}} head-final language. The verb <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of}} the clause, with {{a typical}} word order of subject–object–verb (SOV). However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different pragmatic effects. Tamil has postpositions rather than prepositions. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe {{division}} tracks down {{a series}} of deaths of wives shortly after the passing of their respective husbands. Discovering traces of the husbands' DNA on {{the bodies of the}} wives, Walter Bishop (John Noble) suspects that the killer is using pheromones taken from the husbands to get close to the wives, using the substances as a perfume. Further identifying castoreum within the pheromone mix, they identify the murderer as Anson Carr (Michael Massee), a former and disgruntled employee of a perfume company inflicted with a rare skin disease. They arrive at Carr's home to find another husband, already dead, in a dehydration chamber, and race to protect his wife, Dianna (Ona Grauer). When no attack <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> the wife, Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) realizes that her husband may have been having an affair, and races to the mistress' home, stopping Carr before he can kill her. As he is taken away, he admits he was trying to discover what love was, scientifically, so that he could reproduce it and allow the entire world to share in it.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend of}} {{accelerating}} {{the speed at}} which welds are performed in the steel erection industry <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a risk to the integrity of the connection. Without proper fusion to the base materials provided by sufficient arc time on the weld, a project inspector cannot ensure the effective diameter of the puddle weld therefore he or she cannot guarantee the published load capacities unless they witness the actual installation. This method of puddle welding is common in the United States and Canada for attaching steel sheets to bar joist and structural steel members. Regional agencies are responsible for ensuring the proper installation of puddle welding on steel construction sites. Currently there is no standard or weld procedure which can ensure the published holding capacity of any unwitnessed connection, but this is under review by the American Welding Society.|$|E

5|$|Two {{and a half}} centuries {{after the}} First War of the Races, Brona returns as the Warlock Lord, now with Skull Bearers as his servants. Chronicled in the prequel novel First King of Shannara, the Second War of the Races begins with the {{destruction}} of the Druid Order. A lone Druid, Bremen, forges a magical talisman to destroy the Warlock Lord; it is given to the Elven King, Jerle Shannara. As it {{takes the form of a}} blade, the talisman is named the Sword of Shannara. It succeeds in banishing the Warlock Lord. He is not killed, but his army is defeated by the combined armies of the Elves and Dwarves. Peace <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a high price, interracial tension is renewed and the Druids have vanished.|$|E

25|$|Since 2012 {{the race}} {{finishes}} in Oudenaarde. The last two climbs of the race, the Oude Kwaremont and the Paterberg, are both tackled {{twice in a}} finishing circuit. During the last loop, the Oude Kwaremont <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> 16km from the finish and the Paterberg at 13km, often marking the decisive sites of the race. After the Paterberg comes a flat run-in towards the finish, totalling ca. 265km.|$|E

Such rolling stock usually <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> night (via {{the connection with}} the mainline at Wymondham) at slow speed (sometimes on wheelskates) from Crown Point depot in Norwich (where no road-rail loading facilities are available) for onward road movement to specialist repair facilities around the country.|$|E

25|$|When a {{programming}} language evolves a more elaborate type system, it gains a more finely grained rule set than basic type checking, but this <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a price when the type inferences (and other properties) become undecidable, and when more attention must be paid by the programmer to annotate code or to consider computer-related operations and functioning. It is challenging to find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a type safe manner.|$|E

25|$|The Ruger P-Series {{is a line}} of {{centerfire}} semi-automatic pistols made by Sturm, Ruger & Company {{produced from}} 1985 to 2013. The P-Series pistols were designed for military, police, civilian and recreational use. The designs are largely based on the Browning action found in the M1911 pistol, but with minor variations, generally related to the safety mechanism and the barrel-camblock interface. Reviews have considered them rugged, reliable, and strong, though this strength <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> the price of bulk and a blocky appearance.|$|E
25|$|Eggs can be lost due to {{predation}} or carelessness. Crows and gulls are opportunist egg thieves. Eggs {{are also}} knocked from ledges during fights. If the first egg is lost, the female may lay a second egg. This egg is usually {{lighter than the}} first, with a lighter yolk. Chicks from second eggs grow quicker than those from first eggs. However this rapid growth <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a cost, first chicks have larger fat reserves and can withstand temporary shortages of food.|$|E
25|$|Some Orthodox {{charge that}} joining in this unity <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> {{the expense of}} {{ignoring}} critical doctrinal differences and past atrocities. From the perspective of many Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholicism is a ploy by Roman Catholicism to undermine and ultimately destroy their church by undermining its legitimacy and absorbing it into the Roman Catholic Church. It is feared that this ploy would diminish the power to the original eastern Patriarchs {{of the church and}} would require the acceptance of rejected doctrines and Scholasticism over faith.|$|E

25|$|Both Chicken and Hawk–Dove are anti-coordination games, {{in which}} it is {{mutually}} beneficial for the players to play different strategies. In this way, it {{can be thought of as}} the opposite of a coordination game, where playing the same strategy Pareto dominates playing different strategies. The underlying concept is that players use a shared resource. In coordination games, sharing the resource creates a benefit for all: the resource is non-rivalrous, and the shared usage creates positive externalities. In anti-coordination games the resource is rivalrous but non-excludable and sharing <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a cost (or negative externality).|$|E
25|$|The naked carp, {{a closely}} related species native to the high-altitude Lake Qinghai, is also able to remodel their gills in {{response}} to hypoxic conditions. In response to oxygen levels 95% lower than normoxic conditions, apoptosis of ILCM increases lamellar surface area by up to 60% after just 24 hours. However, this <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> a significant osmoregulatory cost, reducing sodium and chloride levels in the cytoplasm by over 10%. The morphological response to hypoxia by scaleless carp is the fastest respiratory surface remodelling reported in vertebrates thus far.|$|E
25|$|Atiyah {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some geometric object that the groups act on and then classifying these geometric structures. The problem is that no one has been able to suggest an easy way to find such a geometric structure associated to a simple group. In some sense the classification does work by finding geometric structures such as BN-pairs, but this only <b>comes</b> <b>at</b> the end of a very long and difficult analysis of the structure of a finite simple group.|$|E
