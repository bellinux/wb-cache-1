50|$|Normally {{cell culture}} {{experiments}} are {{performed in a}} <b>CO2</b> <b>incubator.</b> Also perfusion culture experiments can be performed in such an atmosphere. However, a much better solution is the performance of perfusion culture experiments under atmospheric air on a laboratory table, since it facilitates the complete handling. However, {{in this case the}} culture medium has to be adjusted to atmospheric air.Keeping media in a 5% CO2 atmosphere within an incubator always a relatively high amount of NaHCO3 is contained to maintain a constant pH between 7.2 and 7.4. If such a formulated medium is used for perfusion culture outside a <b>CO2</b> <b>incubator,</b> the pH will shift from the physiological range to much more alkaline values due to the low content of CO2 (0.3%) in atmospheric air.For that reason any medium used for perfusion culture outside a <b>CO2</b> <b>incubator</b> has to be stabilized by reducing the NaHCO3 concentration and/or by adding biological buffers such as HEPES (GIBCO/Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) or BUFFER ALL (Sigma-Aldrich-Chemie, München, Germany). The necessary amount can be easily determined by admixing increasing amounts of biological buffer solution to an aliquot of medium. Then the medium must equilibrate over night on a thermo plate at 37 °C under atmospheric air. For example, application of 50 mmol/l HEPES or an equivalent of BUFFER ALL (ca. 1%) to IMDM (Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium, GIBCO/Invitrogen) will maintain a constant pH of 7.4 throughout long term perfusion culture under atmospheric air on a laboratory table.|$|E

50|$|As noted above, the ELISPOT assays {{employ a}} {{technique}} {{very similar to}} the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. Either a monoclonal (preferred for greater specificity) or polyclonal capture antibody is coated aseptically onto a PVDF-backed microplate. These antibodies are chosen for their specificity for the analyte in question. The plate is blocked, usually with a serum protein that is non-reactive with any of the antibodies in the assay. After this, cells of interest are plated out at varying densities, along with antigen or mitogen, and then placed in a humidified 37 °C <b>CO2</b> <b>incubator</b> for a specified period of time.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} oocyte source on in vitro maturation (IVM) and embryo developmental competence in goats by the intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) technique. Oocytes were obtained either by laparoscopic ovum pick-up (LOPU) or by slicing of abattoir ovaries. The donor does used for LOPU were superstimulated and their estrus was synchronized. Recovered oocytes from both sources were cultured in microdrops of IVM medium {{in the presence of}} CO(2) (5 %) at 38. 5 degrees C in a <b>CO(2)</b> <b>incubator</b> for 27 h. The ICSI was performed with immobilized sperm on the lid of a culture dish (35 mm) under an Olympus inverted microscope fitted with Narishige micromanipulators. Injected oocytes were cultured for < 192 h in mSOF medium in the <b>CO(2)</b> <b>incubator.</b> Although oocyte recovery per doe was higher (P < 0. 05) in abattoir (27. 3 +/- 3. 0) than LOPU (17. 6 +/- 2. 5) source, better quality oocytes were obtained from LOPU. Oocyte maturation rate was higher (P < 0. 01) in LOPU (73. 8 +/- 3. 0 %) than abattoir-derived (54. 0 +/- 0. 7 %) oocytes. Fertilization and cleavage rates (60. 9 +/- 2. 1 % and 83. 1 +/- 2. 6 %, respectively) were also higher (P < 0. 05) with LOPU than abattoir-derived (50. 6 +/- 2. 3 % and 69. 3 +/- 4. 5 %) oocytes. A higher (P < 0. 05) proportion of LOPU-derived embryos (20. 0 +/- 1. 2 %) progressed to the morula stage than abattoir (11. 3 +/- 4. 7 %) source. In conclusion, better maturation, fertilization, and embryo development rates were obtained with LOPU-derived oocytes than with the abattoir source...|$|E

40|$|To culture {{preimplantation}} embryos in vitro, water-jacketed <b>CO(2)</b> <b>incubators</b> {{are used}} widely for maintaining an optimal culture environment {{in terms of}} gas phase, temperature and humidity. We investigated the possibility of mouse embryo culture {{in a plastic bag}} kept at 37 °C. Zygotes derived from in vitro fertilization or collected from naturally mated B 6 D 2 F 1 female mice were put in a drop of medium on a plastic culture dish and then placed in a commercially available plastic bag. When these were placed in an oven under air at 37 °C for 96 h, the rate of blastocyst development and the cell numbers of embryos decreased. However, when the concentration of O(2) was reduced to 5 % using a deoxidizing agent and a small oxygen meter, most zygotes developed into blastocysts. These blastocysts were judged normal according to their cell number, Oct 3 / 4 and Cdx 2 gene expression levels, the apoptosis rate and the potential for full-term development after embryo transfer to pseudopregnant recipients. Furthermore, using this system, normal offspring were obtained simply by keeping the bag on a warming plate. This culture method was applied successfully to both hybrid and inbred strains. In addition, because the developing embryos could be observed through the transparent wall of the bag, it was possible to capture time-lapse images of live embryos until the blastocyst stage without needing an expensive microscope-based incubation chamber. These results suggest that mouse zygotes are more resilient to their environment than generally believed. This method might prove useful in economical culture systems or for the international shipment of embryos...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the preparation of}} macrophage monolayer from carp peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) to clarify the biosynthesis and processing of cathepsins. PEC collected at 24 h interval after elicitation with 6 % sodium caseinate or thioglycolate medium were transferred to culture dish in RPMI 1640 (RPMI), and the cells were incubated in <b>CO₂</b> <b>incubator</b> for 2 h. To distinguish macrophage and neutrophil, the adherent cells washed with RPMI to remove non-adherent cells were analyzed histochemically by the staining of two different esterase activities. The number of PEC was maximally increased at 3 days after injection with 15 ml of sodium caseinate, whereas that of macrophages was at 4 days after injection. Most. (about 90 %) of cells cultured for 24 h were positive for α-Naphthyl butyrate esterase activity {{but they were not}} positive for Naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase activity, confirming them to be macrophage. They were able to culture for 48 h in RPMI containing 5 % heat inactivated calf serum.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{contamination}} of ready-to-use food thickeners, {{collected from the}} South-East geo-political zone in Nigeria, by aflatoxigenic form of Aspergillus species. A total of 150 samples from different open markets were observed for fungal contamination by using serial dilution-spread plate method. Although, Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium were the most frequently isolated fungi, Aspergillus species {{were found to be}} the most prevalent in all the samples. Furthermore, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus produced aflatoxin on yeast extract sucrose (YES) media incubated for 10 to 15 days at 27 degrees C in a <b>CO(2)</b> <b>incubator.</b> Aspergillus niger showed no sign of any secondary metabolite on the media, set at similar conditions. Although, light microscopy was used to identify these fungi, based on colony morphology, PCR method was used to confirm genetic variation among the Aspergillus group, using ITS set of primers. Gel electrophoresis of PCR products confirmed the presence of Aspergillus species at an amplification range from 500 to 600 bp in all the samples tested. PCR was found to be a sensitive and a more reliable tool for detection and identification of Aspergillus species in food thickeners as opposed to conventional light microscopy. This is a first kind of mycological survey on the contamination of ready-to-use food thickeners sold in Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-five {{patients}} with aplastic anemia, 8 female and 17 male aged from 16 to 79 year-old, were examined their circulating lymphocyte subpopulations and {{the responses to}} mitogens in vitro. T-lymphocyte was identified using sheep erythrocyte rosette-formation test under the Nikon phase contrast microscope. Surface immunoglobulin bearing cell was identified under the Nikon fluoromicroscope as B-lymphocyte using membrane immuno-fluorescence test. As mitogens in vitro PHA-P (Difco Lab.) and pokeweed mitogen (Grand Island Biol. Co.) {{were added to the}} lymphocyte culture during 68 hours in the <b>CO(2)</b> <b>incubator</b> following 4 hours flushing with (3) H-TdR. The incorporated cpm was counted with millipore filtration and a liquid scintillation counter (Shimazu). According the severity of aplastic anemia, the patients showed decreased circulating lymphocytes, decreased T- and B-lymphocytes with increased null cells. The incorporation of (3) H-TdR in vitro in the soloculture decreased remarkably as well as PHA-P responsiveness. Increased bone marrow T-lymphosytes were noticed in those patients. Although the higher cpm of soloculture of the bone marrow lymphocyte was obtained than of the circulating lymphocyte, extremely low responses to PHA-P and pokeweed mitogen were characteristic in the aplastic bone marrow lymphocytes. The splenectomy corrected T- and B-lymphocytes population in contrast to the persistent low responsiveness to mitogens. The abnormality of lymphocyte subpopulations and incorporation rate of (3) H-thymidin stimulated with pokeweed mitogen and PHA-P might effect on bone marrow cells as cytotoxic or cytolytic...|$|E
40|$|A simple, reliable, and user {{friendly}} system {{was established to}} cultivate Caco- 2 cell monolayer for epithelial transport studies. After an initial growth period of 1 week in a <b>CO(2)</b> <b>incubator,</b> Caco- 2 cells were cultivated in an automated continuous perfusion system (Minucells and Minutissue, Germany). Medium was constantly renewed at the apical and basal side of the monolayers, {{which resulted in a}} continuous supply of nutrients as well as in a continuous removal of metabolite wastes. The monolayers obtained with the new perfusion culture system were evaluated to estimate the passive transport properties of a series of model compounds. The results produced were compared to those of monolayers obtained with the standard 21 -day system. The integrity of cell monolayers was checked by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and by the transport of the paracellular leakage marker sodium fluorescein. The results of confocal microscopy as well as TEER measurements indicated the formation of a monolayer on various support filters. The growth and differentiation of Caco- 2 cells were highly dependent upon the individual support filters and extracellular matrix proteins used for Caco- 2 attachment. The permeability coefficients of several model compounds across Caco- 2 cells obtained with the perfusion system were approximately two-fold higher than those obtained using the traditional 21 -day Snapwell-based cultures. A good correlation was found between the transport of passively diffused drugs across Caco- 2 monolayers differentiated in the perfusion system and the transport according to the standard method. The rank ordering of high permeable model compounds tested through Caco- 2 monolayers, differentiated in a perfusion system, was similar to the standard 21 -day culture method. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The `biomimetic` {{approach}} to tissue engineering usually {{involves the use}} of a bioreactor mimicking physiological parameters whilst supplying nutrients to the developing tissue. Here we present a new heart valve bioreactor, having as its centrepiece a ventricular assist device (VAD), which exposes the cell-scaffold constructs to a wider array of mechanical forces. The pump of the VAD has two chambers: a blood and a pneumatic chamber, separated by an elastic membrane. Pulsatile air-pressure is generated by a piston-type actuator and delivered to the pneumatic chamber, ejecting the fluid in the blood chamber. Subsequently, applied vacuum to the pneumatic chamber causes the blood chamber to fill. A mechanical heart valve was placed in the VAD`s inflow position. The tissue engineered (TE) valve was placed in the outflow position. The VAD was coupled in series with a Windkessel compliance chamber, variable throttle and reservoir, connected by silicone tubings. The reservoir sat on an elevated platform, allowing adjustment of ventricular preload between 0 and 11 mmHg. To allow for sterile gaseous exchange between the circuit interior and exterior, a 0. 2 mu m filter was placed at the reservoir. Pressure and flow were registered downstream of the TE valve. The circuit was filled with culture medium and fitted in a standard 5 % <b>CO(2)</b> <b>incubator</b> set at 37 degrees C. Pressure and flow waveforms were similar to those obtained under physiological conditions for the pulmonary circulation. The `cardiomimetic` approach presented here represents a new perspective to conventional biomimetic approaches in TE, with potential advantages. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
