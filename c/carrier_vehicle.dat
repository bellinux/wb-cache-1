5|$|The Infantry Fighting Vehicle {{superseded}} {{the previous}} infantry carrier replacement effort, the XM1206 Infantry <b>Carrier</b> <b>Vehicle</b> of the FCS MGV program. It was the U.S. Army's intention that the IFV replace the M113 APC by 2018, the M2 Bradley later, and the Stryker ICV in the midterm. The IFV was {{to hold a}} crew of three and a squad of nine.|$|E
25|$|The Infantry Fighting Vehicle variant was {{intended}} to fill the infantry transport role in Heavy Brigade Combat Teams replacing the aging M113 APC, M2 Bradley, and M1126 Infantry <b>Carrier</b> <b>Vehicle.</b> It was the U.S. Army's intention that the IFV replace the M113 APC in the near term, and the M2 Bradley and M1126 ICV in the midterm.|$|E
25|$|Testing of commercially {{available}} combat vehicles began in May 2012 at Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range {{to prepare the}} Army for Milestone B. The Non-Developmental Vehicle analysis assessed five vehicles, the M2A3 Bradley, Namer, CV-9035, a double v-hulled M1126 Infantry <b>Carrier</b> <b>Vehicle</b> and a turretless Bradley. The tests, completed on May 25, were carried out to determine what vehicle variants and configurations fulfill the Army's needs. The Army found that although the vehicles assessed met some GCV requirements, no currently fielded vehicle met enough without needing significant redesign.|$|E

25|$|Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV)/DRDO Daksh: A tracked robotic {{vehicle with}} {{staircase}} climbing ability {{has been developed}} and is particularly intended for remote explosion of explosive devices. The ROV is carried in a specially designed <b>carrier</b> <b>vehicle</b> with additional armament and firing ports. The ROV itself is fairly sophisticated, with provision to carry various optronic payloads, an articulated gripper to pick up objects, an ability to traverse difficult terrain including staircases, {{as well as an}} integral waterjet projector to blow up explosive packages. It was formally inducted into Indian army's corps of engineers on 19 December 2011. The Indian army placed a total order of 20 ROVs and 6 of them are now operational with army. Each unit cost about Rs. 9million.|$|E
2500|$|The Ground Combat Infantry Fighting Vehicle was an {{infantry}} fighting vehicle {{being developed}} for the U.S. Army. The program originated as the lead vehicle of the U.S. Army's Ground Combat Vehicle program coordinated by TACOM and spawned a parallel program coordinated by DARPA. The purpose {{of the program was}} to replace existing armored personnel carriers and infantry fighting vehicles in U.S. Army service. [...] The DARPA project aimed to have the vehicle designed by 2015. Derivatives of the vehicle based on a common chassis—such as tanks and ambulances—were expected to be manufactured. It replaced the previous attempt at a next-generation infantry transport, the XM1206 Infantry <b>Carrier</b> <b>Vehicle.</b> The Ground Combat Vehicle program was cancelled in February 2014.|$|E
2500|$|An Army {{presentation}} in March revealed that TARDEC, ARL, and TRADOC - ARCIC had partnered {{to analyze the}} survivability of the army's [...] "Ground Combat Vehicle". Army Chief of Staff Robert Gates announced his intention of halting funding for the XM1206 Infantry <b>Carrier</b> <b>Vehicle</b> of the FCS manned ground vehicle program in April 2009. In late May, Army and Department of Defense representatives outlined plans for the cancellation of Future Combat Systems and the initiation of the Ground Combat Vehicle program in its place. On 15 and 16 June, a blue-ribbon panel convened in Washington D.C. to determine the requirements for the Ground Combat Vehicle. It was concluded at this meeting that an Infantry Fighting Vehicle {{was to be the}} first vehicle variant fielded. Defense contractors were not allowed to attend but at least six in attendance were employed by defense companies that eventually bid on the GCV contract. On 23 June, Future Combat Systems was formally dissolved and many programs including the Manned Ground Vehicle program were canceled with it. On 19 October, contractors turned up for a U.S. Army organized industry day event in Dearborn, Michigan to learn about the requirements. In late October [...] was established to oversee subsystems of BCT Modernization including the GCV. On 24 November, a second industry day was held in Warren, Michigan.|$|E
