5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight the grapevine phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the <b>cottony</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>scale,</b> Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the <b>cottony</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>scale</b> population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E

50|$|The Margarodidae {{or ground}} pearls (<b>cottony</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>scales,</b> giant coccids, giant scale insects) are {{a family of}} scale insects within the {{superfamily}} Coccoidea. Members of the family include the Polish cochineal and Armenian cochineal (genus Porphyrophora) and the original ground pearl genus, Margarodes. Beginning in 1880, a number of distinct subfamilies were recognized, with the giant coccis (the Monophlebidae) being the first. Although Maskell proposed a new family, many continued to regard the monophlebids as a mere subfamily for many years, and the Margarodidae classification continued to be polyphyletic through the 20th Century. Since then, taking the advice of Koteja several subfamilies and tribes have been elevated into their own families such as Matsucoccidae and Xylococcidae. The pared-down family of Margarodidae (Margarodidae sensu stricto or Margarodidae s. s.) is monophyletic.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} generalist aphid and scale predators and {{incidental}} substances of botanical origin, many Coccinellidae do favour or even specialise in certain prey types.

However, the adult R. cardinalis can subsist for some months on a wider range of insects plus some nectar.|$|E

50|$|Some ant {{species can}} {{increase}} infestations of red scale indirectly.

50|$|At his request, Koebele was {{transferred}} in 1885 to Alameda, California {{where he studied}} local insect pests and evaluated the effectiveness of various insecticides. At this time the California citrus industry was facing an economic crisis {{brought about by the}} <b>cottony</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>scale</b> (Icerya purchasi), an invasive insect that had established itself in California orchards several years earlier. Koebele was soon focused on this pest, working alongside another federal entomologist, Daniel William Coquillett, to find a remedy. Insecticides had little effect and growers resorted to pulling up infested trees and burning them.|$|E
50|$|Coquillett {{placed the}} vedalia beetles on an infested orange tree {{enclosed}} in a tent. In a few months, the beetles had multiplied prolifically and devoured the scale insects. When the tent was opened, the beetles spread to adjoining trees {{and soon the}} entire orchard was free of the <b>cottony</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>scale.</b> As word of the dramatic results spread, citrus growers from throughout the state came to gather the insects and release them into their orchards. The beetles spread rapidly and by 1890 California was almost entirely free of the pest.|$|E
50|$|Back in Washington, Riley {{had noted}} the curious fact that citrus trees in Australia were largely {{unaffected}} by the <b>cottony</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>scale</b> even though the insect was native to the region. He suspected that natural predators of the scale insects held them in check. In 1888 Riley sent Koebele to Australia to investigate. There he found two likely predators of the scale—a parasitic fly (Cryptochaetum iceryae) and the vedalia beetle (Rodolia cardinalis). Koebele captured hundreds of these insects and shipped them back to Coquillett in California for further evaluation.|$|E
5000|$|After {{experimenting with}} {{kerosene}} application, Maskell became {{an advocate of}} biological control of pests, which involves finding their natural predators. He helped Albert Koebele of the United States Department of Agriculture collect vedalia [...] "ladybird" [...] beetles (Rodolia cardinalis), a predator of <b>cottony</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>scale,</b> which had become a devastating pest of Californian citrus farms. In its native Australia this pest was kept in check (so F. S. Crawford found) by a dipterous fly Cryptochetum iceryae which injected its eggs into the scale insect, which was then devoured by the resultant larvae.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} generalist aphid and scale predators and {{incidental}} substances of botanical origin, many Coccinellidae do favour or even specialise in certain prey types.

However, the adult R. cardinalis can subsist for some months on a wider range of insects plus some nectar.|$|E
50|$|Although {{many species}} of Hemiptera are {{significant}} pests of crops and garden plants, including {{many species of}} aphid and scale insects, other species are harmless. The damage done is often {{not so much the}} deprivation of the plant of its sap, but the fact that they transmit serious viral diseases between plants. They often produce copious amounts of honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mould. Significant pests include the <b>cottony</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>scale,</b> a pest of citrus fruit trees, the green peach aphid and other aphids which attack crops worldwide and transmit diseases, and jumping plant lice which are often host plant-specific and transmit diseases.|$|E
5000|$|Biological {{control was}} {{initiated}} in South Africa {{at the turn}} of the century when <b>cottony</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>scale</b> in citrus orchards was brought under control. Originally identified in 1878 in New Zealand, it is now found worldwide in citrus orchards and is controlled by the ladybird beetle Rodolia cardinalis. Another successful program was the virtual eradication of Opuntia vulgaris by the use of cochineal insects in 1913. Control of the Eucalyptus snout beetle followed in 1925 with the introduction of the egg parasite Anaphes nitens, a wasp native to Australia. Integrated pest management saw a swing away from pest eradication to pest control with a goal of minimal harmful side effects, reduced environmental damage, little consumer risk and ecological sustainability.|$|E
