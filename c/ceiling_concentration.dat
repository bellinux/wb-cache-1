The chemical composition of the by-products was dominated by Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Al, and Si. All samples were highly alkaline with paste pH values ranging from 9. 9 to 12. 3. All of the PFBC materials met the criteria for pollutant <b>ceiling</b> <b>concentrations</b> for land application of sewage sludge for Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mo, Ni, Se, and Zn.

PFBC bed ashes were similar in composition but contained less unspent sorbent and more, anhydrite and periclase. The artificial weathering study examined water soluble ions and reaction products of two mine spoils and one cyclone ash mixed at four rates. The spoils were mixed with PFBC by-products to yield mixtures containing 0, 10, 20, and 40 weight percent by-product. Leachate composition was mostly a function of rate of application and equilibration time. In general, the addition of PFBC by-product increased pH, conductivity, and the concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, Mo, Na, S, and Sr. The concentrations of Al, Fe, and Mn decreased. Six metals (Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Cr, and Pb) regulated by the Resource Conservation Recovery Act were below concentration levels defined for drinking water standards (Hg and Se not available). All application rates of the PFBC by-product increased the solution pH significantly. A pH of 7. 8 or greater was attained in all PFBC-spoil mixtures after 132 days. Changes in solid phase composition were independent of the spoil. The final reaction products were more directly influenced by the characteristics of the PFBC by-product...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{regulation}} of greenhouse gases emissions related to climate change. We consider a stylized climate-economy sequential model and use a cost-effectiveness approach. The analytical study {{is based on a}} dynamic programming method. It provides both a tolerable <b>ceiling</b> of <b>concentration</b> and, under simple conditions involving the marginal abatement cost and emission functions, optimal and effective abatement rates. In particular, we prove how the cost effective abatement rate increases with time. Through the optimal time to act function, we examine in detail the role played by greenhouse gases absorption, growth and discount rates. We also analyze the paths from an intergenerational equity perspective. Numerical examples illustrate the general statements. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The cyclone ashes were composed of fly ash, dolomite, anhydrite, periclase, and calcite in decreasing order of abundance. By comparison, bed residues contained less dolomite and fly ash but more anhydrite, calcite and periclase. All samples were highly alkaline with paste pH values ranging from 9. 9 to 12. 3. The major element chemistry of the by-products was dominated by Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Al and Si. All materials met the criteria for <b>ceiling</b> <b>concentrations</b> of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mo, Ni, Se and Zn as defined for land application of sewage sludges.

The study was performed using two mine spoils (pH 3. 8 and 5. 6) mixed with cyclone ash at rates of 0, 10, 20 and 40 wt % by-product. The composition of leachates from the mixtures was mostly a function of rate of by-product application and equilibration time. In general, the addition of PFBC by-product increased pH, conductivity, and the concentrations of dissolved Ca, K, Mg, Mo, Na, S, and Sr whereas the concentrations of Al, Fe, and Mn decreased.

We have demonstrated that DPP 4 -deficient rats possess resistance to endotoxemia and ischemia/reperfusion stress. However, whether the decrease of DPP 4 activity simply augmented the GLP- 1 signaling or that such decrease resulted in a change of cellular function remain unclear. Accordingly, we investigated the responses of H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative stress in adult wild-type and DPP 4 -deficient rats isolated cardiomyocytes. The coadministration of GLP- 1 or DPP 4 inhibitor was also performed to define the mechanisms. Cell viability, ROS concentration, catalase activity, glucose uptake, prosurvival, proapoptotic signaling, and contractile function were examined after cells exposed to H 2 O 2. DPP 4 -deficient cardiomyocytes were found to be resistant to H 2 O 2 -induced cell death via activating AKT signaling, enhancing glucose uptake, preserving catalase activity, diminishing ROS level and proapoptotic signaling. GLP- 1 concentration-dependently improved cell viability in wild-type cardiomyocyte against ROS stress, and the <b>ceiling</b> response <b>concentration</b> (200 nM) was chosen for studies. GLP- 1 was shown to decrease H 2 O 2 -induced cell death by its receptor-dependent AKT pathway in wild-type cardiomyocytes, but failed to cause further activation of AKT in DPP 4 -deficient cardiomyocytes.

Determining the concentration of antimony in blood is far from straightforward because samples are highly prone to contamination and values are low, close to the detection limits of the techniques available. In combination with the lack of adequate certified reference materials, this makes it impossible to establish a value for antimony content in the blood of healthy, non-exposed individuals based on published values.

Turning to the EU-US debate about the interpretation of the "supplemental to" condition in Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol regarding the articulation between international trading systems and domestic policies and measures, this text illuminates the risk of dynamic inconsistencies due to the heterogeneity of capital stocks in the economy, if price signals do not emerge in due time from GHGs trading systems because of the ''hot air'' in some countries and the discovery of low costs abatement potentials in Annex B countries.

In its 1977 Special Occupational Hazard Review on EtO, NIOSH recommended that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) 8 hour time weighted average exposure level of 50 parts per million (ppm) be observed, and that occupational exposure be limited to a <b>ceiling</b> <b>concentration</b> of 75 ppm. Studies in Fischer- 344 -rats exposed by inhalation to 10, 33, or 100 ppm EtO for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for about 2 years showed dose related excesses of mononuclear cell leukemia in females and peritoneal mesothelioma in males, {{both of which were}} significantly increased. Preliminary evidence of dose dependent injection site sarcomas after chronic subcutaneous injection of EtO were obtained in NMRI-mice. In-vitro microbial and animal test systems showed mutagenicity and alkylating activity of EtO, and mutagenic and adverse reproductive effects and chromosomal abnormalities were found in experimental animals. Epidemiologic studies of exposed worker populations demonstrated possible carcinogenic activity, with increases in overall death rates, all cancers, leukemia, stomach cancer, and circulatory system mortality. Exposures were generally below current standards, although occasional excursions to higher levels were possible. Chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges in peripheral lymphocytes were increased in one exposed worker population studied. It is recommended that ethylene-oxide be considered a potential occupational carcinogen and that the OSHA standard be reexamined. Suggested measures for minimizing worker exposure include product substitution, contaminant controls, worker isolation, and use of personal protective equipment.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{fraction of}} protected cultivations is on systems where drain water is recollected and re-used for irrigation (closed systems). Such systems {{have a direct}} reward for growers in saving on fertilizers (and water) costs and in a higher value of the product, caused by a better control of the root environment. In view of {{the benefit of the}} prevention of leaching of chemicals in the environment, the application of closed irrigation systems is being increasingly made compulsory. However, when irrigation water contains non-nutrient salts, such salts will accumulate in the closed loop. Since a high salt concentration is known to cause yield loss (though the effect is specie-specific), first or later salts will have to be leached out, by draining the loop. Indeed, even in Holland (where environmental rules are possibly the strictest) growers are allowed to leach the system whenever a specie-specific <b>ceiling</b> of sodium <b>concentration</b> is reached. It can be shown that in a crop cycle, the fraction of water that is leached is nearly proportional to the ratio between the concentration of the critical salt of the irrigation water and the concentration at which the system is leached. In principle, therefore, the ¿optimal¿ EC-ceiling can be calculated, that balances marginal costs of water and fertilizers with marginal yield loss. By using a number of yield response curves, in a couple of different cases (Holland and Mediterranean basin), we show that, with realistic prices both of resources and of produce, the optimal EC is very near to the value that ensures maximal yield. That is, there is no advantage to the grower in maintaining a closed loop whenever the quality of irrigation water is poor. Therefore, closed systems are financially viable only in two cases: a. in regions with good water or b. with high-value crops that offset the costs of ensuring good water (such as rain collection or desalinization). We will show that the latter is the case in most protected cultivation in Europe. On the other hand, {{there is no way that}} low-value crops in poor-water-quality regions may still be profitable under stricter environmental rules. This means that local authorities, seriously planning to enforce such rules, should either provide incentives for growers to switch to less sensitive or more valuable combinations of crops, or contemplate developing other economic activities than agriculture...|$|R
