40|$|This paper proposes an {{estimation}} algorithm for {{the electrical}} parameters of synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs) {{by using a}} synchronous PI <b>current</b> regulator <b>at</b> <b>standstill.</b> In reality, the electrical parameters are only measured or estimated in limited conditions without fully considering {{the effects of the}} switching devices, connecting wires, and magnetic saturation. As a result, the acquired electrical parameters are different from the real parameters of the motor drive system. In this paper, the effects of switching devices, connecting wires, and the magnetic saturation are considered by simultaneously using the short pulse and closed loop equations of resistance and synchronous inductances. Therefore, the proposed algorithm can be easily and safely implemented with a reduced measuring time. In addition, it does not need any external or additional measurement equipment, information on the motor’s dimensions, and material characteristics {{as in the case of}} FEM. Several experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm...|$|R
5000|$|The {{shape and}} depth of the rotor bars {{can be used to}} vary the speed-torque {{characteristics}} of the induction motor. <b>At</b> <b>standstill,</b> the revolving magnetic field passes the rotor bars at a high rate, inducing line-frequency current into the rotor bars. Due to the skin effect, the induced current tends to flow at {{the outer edge of the}} winding. As the motor accelerates, the slip frequency decreases and induced <b>current</b> flows <b>at</b> greater depths in the winding. By tapering the profile of the rotor bars to vary their resistance at different depths, or by constructing a double squirrel cage, the motor can be arranged to produce more or less torque <b>at</b> <b>standstill</b> and near its synchronous speed.|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study tested {{whether the}} ease of {{learning}} to use human–machine inter-faces of in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) can be assessed <b>at</b> <b>standstill.</b> Background: Assessing the attentional demand of IVIS should include an evaluation of ease of learn-ing, because the use of IVIS at low skill levels may create safety-relevant distractions. Method: Skill acquisition in operating IVIS was quantified by fitting the power law of practice to training data sets collected in a driving study and <b>at</b> <b>standstill.</b> Participants practiced manual destination entry with two route guidance systems differing in cog-nitive demand. In Experiment 1, a sample of middle-aged participants was trained while steering routes of varying driving demands. In Experiment 2, another sample of middle-aged participants was trained <b>at</b> <b>standstill.</b> Results: In Experiment 1, dis-play glance times were less affected by driving demands than by total task times and decreased at slightly higher speed-up rates (0. 02 higher on average) than task times collected <b>at</b> <b>standstill</b> in Experiment 2. The system interface that minimized cognitive demand was operated more quickly and was easier to learn. Its system delays increased static task times, which still predicted 58 % of variance in display glance times compared with even 76 % for the second system. Conclusion: The ease of learning to use an IVIS interface and the decrease in attentional demand with training can be assessed at stand-still. Application: Fitting the power law of practice to static task times yields parameters that predict display glance times while driving, which {{makes it possible to}} compare interfaces with regard to ease of learning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{a new and}} novel method designed to detect rotor position by decoding received information in two different techniques for switched reluctance motor <b>at</b> <b>standstill</b> and also low speeds. These decoding techniques are namely, digital pulse width modulation (DPWM) decoder and digital pulse position modulation (DPPM) decoder. This method begins by connecting a small capacitor in series with each motor phase winding. The supply voltage {{in conjunction with the}} drive transistor produces a short pulse for each phase capacitor. Since the phase inductance varies with the rotor position, the rise time of the voltage produced on each capacitor changes as well. Next, the capacitor voltages are compared with some pre-set voltage values and the rotor position is detected <b>at</b> <b>standstill</b> mode. The number of pre-set voltage values varies for each technique. It then continues to sense the rotor position while the motor is running by applying the same procedure, but only to the un-energized phases windings. The results obtained demonstrate the feasibility and practicability of the method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Conventional {{techniques}} for sensorless control of permanent magnet synchronous motor drive (PMSM), which requires information on rotor position, are reviewed, and {{recent developments in}} this area are introduced in this paper along with their inherent advantages and drawbacks. The paper presents an improved method for sensorless speed control of PMSM drive with emphasis placed on signal injection method. This signal injection method examines the control performance of sensorless PMSM drive by injecting signal externally and thereby sensing the rotor position. The main objective of this drive system is to have speed control <b>at</b> <b>standstill</b> and low speed regions. Several tests are carried out to demonstrate the ability of proposed models at different operating conditions with the help of simulation results in Matlab/Simulink environment. Simulation results confirm that the proposed sensorless control approach of PMSM can achieve high performance <b>at</b> <b>standstill</b> and low speeds but not at very high speeds.
