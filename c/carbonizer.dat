5000|$|APFBC. In more {{advanced}} second-generation PFBC systems, a pressurized <b>carbonizer</b> is incorporated {{to process the}} feed coal into fuel gas and char. The PFBC burns the char to produce steam and to heat combustion air for the gas turbine. The fuel gas from the <b>carbonizer</b> burns in a topping combustor linked to a gas turbine, heating the gases to the combustion turbine's rated firing temperature. Heat is recovered from the gas turbine exhaust {{in order to produce}} steam, which is used to drive a conventional steam turbine, resulting in a higher overall efficiency for the combined cycle power output. These systems are also called APFBC, or advanced circulating pressurized fluidized-bed combustion combined cycle systems. An APFBC system is entirely coal-fueled.|$|E

The 2 nd Gen PFB plant incorporates the partial gasification of coal in a <b>carbonizer,</b> the combustion of <b>carbonizer</b> char in a pressurized circulating fluidized (PCFB) bed boiler, and the combustion of <b>carbonizer</b> syngas in a topping combustor to achieve gas turbine inlet temperatures of 2700 F and higher.

NARC discontinued production of Aerospace Grade Rayon in September 1997. NASA maintains a stockpile of NARC Rayon to support RSRM production through the summer of 2005. The program plan for selection and qualification of a replacement for NARC rayon was approved in August 1998. Screening activities began in February 1999.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} efficiencies of <b>carbonizers,</b> operation at high pressures is needed. In addition, waste biomass fuels of opportunity {{can be used to}} offset fossil fuel use.

The purpose of the testing program was to generate steady state operating data for modeling efforts of <b>carbonizers.</b> A test program was completed with a matrix of parameters varied one at a time in order to avoid second order interactions. Variables were: coal feed rate, pressure, and varying mixtures of sawdust and coal types. Coal types were Montana Rosebud subbituminous and Pittsburgh No. 8 bituminous. The sawdust was sanding waste from a furniture manufacturer in upstate New York. Coal was sieved from - 14 to + 60 mesh and sawdust was sieved to - 14 mesh. The FBG/C operates at a nominal 425 psig, but pressures can be lowered. For the tests reported it was operated as a jetting, fluidized bed, ash-agglomerating gasifier. Preheated air and steam are injected {{into the center of the}} bottom along with the solid feed that is conveyed with cool air. Fairly stable reactor internal flow patterns develop and temperatures stabilize (with some fluctuations) when steady state is reached. At nominal conditions the solids residence time in the reactor is on the order of 1. 5 to 2 hours, so changes in feed types can require on the order of hours to equilibrate. Changes in operating conditions (e. g. feed rate) usually require much less time. The operating periods of interest for these tests were only the steady state periods, so transient conditions were not monitored as closely. The test matrix first established a base case of operations to which single parameter changes in conditions could be compared. The base case used Montana Rosebud at a coal feed rate of 70 lbm/hr at 425 psig. The coal sawdust mixtures are reported as percent by weight coal to percent by weight sawdust. The mixtures of interest were: 65 / 35 subbituminous, 75 / 25 subbituminous, 85 / 15 subbituminous, and 75 / 25 bituminous. Steady state was achieved quickly when going from one subbituminous mixture to another, but longer when going from subbituminous to bituminous coal. The most apparent observation when comparing the base case to subbituminous coal/sawdust mixtures is that operating conditions are nearly the same. Product gas does not change much in composition and temperatures remain nearly the same. Comparisons of identical weight ratios of sawdust and subbituminous and bituminous mixtures show considerable changes in operating conditions and gas composition. The highly caking bituminous coal used in this test swelled up and became about half as dense as the comparable subbituminous coal char. Some adjustments were required in accommodating changes in solids removal during the test. Nearly all the solids in the bituminous coal sawdust were conveyed into the upper freeboard section and removed at the mid-level of the reactor. This is in marked contrast to the ash-agglomerating condition where most solids are removed at the very bottom of the gasifier. Temperatures in the bottom of the reactor during the bituminous test were very high and difficult to control. The most significant discovery of the tests was that the addition of sawdust allowed gasification of a coal type that had previously resulted in nearly instant clinkering of the gasifier. Several previous attempts at using Pittsburgh No. 8 were done only at the end of the tests when shutdown was imminent anyway. It is speculated that the fine wood dust somehow coats the pyrolyzed sticky bituminous coal particles and prevents them from agglomerating quickly. As the bituminous coal char particles swell, they are carried to the cooler upper regions of the reactor where they re-solidify. Other interesting phenomena were revealed regarding the transport (rheological) properties of the coal sawdust mixtures. The coal sawdust mixtures segregate quickly when transported. This is visibly apparent. To prevent bridges and ratholes from developing in the lowest coal feed hopper, it is normally fluidized. When feeding the coal sawdust mixtures the fluidizing gas was turned off to prevent segregation. The feed system worked as well with no fluidizing gas when using the mixtures as it did with fluidizing gas and only coal. In addition, it was inadvertently discovered that greatly increased pressure above the feeder resulted in greatly increased flow with the mixtures. Increased pressure above the feeder with coal only results in quickly plugging the feed system. Also, it was learned that addition of sawdust reduces the system loss during conveying compared to coal only. This is in spite of overall smaller particle sizes with the coal sawdust mixtures...|$|R

Phase 3 [...] Commercial plant design update: The Second-Generation PFB Combustion Plant conceptual design prepared in 1987 is being updated to reflect the benefit of pilot plant test data and the latest advances in gas turbine technology.

The 1987 study investigated two coal feeding arrangements, e. g., dry and paste feed. Paste feeding resulted in a lower cost of electricity. Paste, however, increases the water content of the <b>carbonizer</b> generated syngas; this increases the equilibrium partial pressure of hydrogen sulfide gas over calcium oxide/calcium carbonate and thereby reduces the <b>carbonizer</b> sulfur capture efficiency. Recognizing that the <b>carbonizer</b> and the CPFBC work together to control the plant overall sulfur capture efficiency, the higher CPFBC efficiency can compensate for the carbonizer's lower sulfur capture efficiency depending upon the amount of coal and/or char being fed to each unit.

In this cycle compressed air is preheated in an atmospheric pressure coal-fired boiler and its temperature raised further by burning natural gas in a topping gas turbine combustor. The coal fired boiler also generates steam {{for use in a}} cogeneration combined cycle. The conceptual design of the combustion turbine is presented with special emphasis on the low-emissions multiannular swirl burner topping combustion system and its special requirements and features. ...|$|E
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería Ambiental) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica, Escuela de Química, 2015. Approximately 40 % of {{residual}} biomass in Costa Rica is wasted. Lignocellulosic wastes are a part; {{though they are}} generated in significant quantities in Costa Rica, they often lack proper management. Their disposal in landfills involves transportation and handling costs, implies later emissions of greenhouse gases, and shortens the lifespan of the landfills. One way to valorize these wastes is carbonization. A portable, 55 gallon capacity, low cost <b>carbonizer</b> that is simple to operate, was designed and constructed at the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica in 2012. This <b>carbonizer</b> is evaluated in the present work; to assess its performance, two locally common wastes were used: construction waste and waste from a pallet factory. Three carbonization essays per feedstock were made. Charcoal yield, firewood requirements, temperatures, times and processes, smoke emission, and charcoal quality were assessed. Charcoal quality was assessed by its organoleptic properties, densities, moisture, resistance to compression, volatiles, ash and heat content, germination inhibition and earthworm refusal. These tests were chosen considering {{the use of the}} charcoal as an energy vehicle and its use as a soil amendment. Yields were 32 % and 29 % relative to the processed feedstock mass, respectively, which is better than the expected yields according to the type of kiln. Firewood required for the process was in average 34 % relative to the total mass of feedstock. The average processing time was 5 hours. Processing time and firewood requirements can be reduced by combining 2 or more reactors. Charcoal obtained had good quality fuel, according to the most analyzed properties; as a soil amendment, results of the germination test and the earthworm test refusal suggest it did not contain harmful substances. The performance of the <b>carbonizer</b> was very good, however, improvement options were pinpointed, regarding use of wasted heat, completion of gas combustion, maintenance of the kiln and loading of the biomass. The <b>carbonizer</b> showed to be a useful tool for the valorization of lignocellulosic wastes and it produces a good quality charcoal. The eventual annual cost of disposition of the wastes in a landfill was estimated in approximately US $ 36 thousand for the pallet waste and US $ 75 thousand for the construction waste. The value of the charcoal that could be produced annually from the wastes considered was estimated in approximately US 20 $ 450 thousand for the pallet waste and approximately US $ 650 thousand for the construction waste.

40|$|The {{economics}} {{and performance of}} advanced pressurized fluidized bed (PFBC) cycles developed for utility applications during the last 10 years (especially the 2 nd-Generation PFBC cycle) are projected to be favorable compared to conventional pulverized coal power plants. However, the improved economics of 2 nd-Generation PFBC cycles are accompanied by the perception of increased technological risk related to the pressurized <b>carbonizer</b> and its associated gas cleanup systems. A PFBC cycle that removed the uncertainties of the <b>carbonizer</b> while retaining the high efficiency and low cost of a 2 nd-Generation PFBC cycle could improve the prospects for early commercialization and {{pave the way for}} the introduction of the complete 2 nd-Generation PFBC cycle at some later date. One such arrangement is a PFBC cycle with natural gas topping combustion, referred to as the 1. 5 -Generation PFBC cycle. This cycle combines the advantages of the 2 nd-Generation PFBC plant with the reduced risk associated with a gas turbine burning natural gas, and can potentially be part of a phased approach leading to the commercialization of utility 2 nd-Generation PFBC cycles. The 1. 5 -Generation PFBC may also introduce other advantages over the more complicated 2 nd-Generation PFBC system.

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{a process for}} eliminating the current practice of dumping unwanted rice production waste, and uncontrolled burning of wastes in the field. Widescale rice husk conversion systems remain constrained by limited regionally-specific agronomic research on {{the efficacy of the}} resultant carbonised waste biochar on rice yields, fertilizer use efficiency, and stable carbon fractions for reliable and safe soil carbon biosequestration practices, as well as the economic incentives for farmers to integrate waste conversion technologies into rice farms. In this study a <b>carbonizer</b> technology was developed and applied to the rice production systems currently used in rural areas of the Philippines. The <b>carbonizer</b> prototypes were fabricated at the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) machine shop in Muñoz Science City, Nueva Ecija, Philippines, and used similar manufacturing techniques commonly used in the local machine shops, i. e., with locally available equipments, skills, and parts. Results from the second refined prototype demonstrated a processing capacity of up to 40 kg hr- 1 of rice husk into biochar, with around 40 % in biochar yield (by mass), and a biochar purity of approximately 99 %. The refined prototype has a smokeless chimney emission during operation and carbon monoxide emissions were greatly reduced (431 ppm). The <b>carbonizer</b> enables waste heat extraction using exchangers or microboilers, with heat produced during combustion available as additional source of energy to partially replace kerosene and firewood currently used. This additional energy source from the use of agriculture waste in carbonizers can {{play a vital role in}} protecting the forests in rural Philippines, whereas population growth and current practices (kerosene and firewood from unmanaged forests) are drivers to illegal deforestation. The adoption of carbonizers can increase carbon sequestration by decreasing firewood demand and avoiding deforestation, (a REDD activity), and the application of biochar for fertilizer further reducing net emissions in the region through soil carbon storage. By increasing aboveground and belowground carbon stocks in the agro-ecosystem, carbonizers can be used strategically for sustainable resource management and as a important tool for reducing emissions as an effective and practical climate change mitigation strategy...|$|E

The Second-Generation PFB Combustion Plant conceptual design prepared in 1987 is being updated to reflect the benefit of pilot plant test data and the latest advances in gas turbine technology. The updated plant is being designed to operate with 95 percent sulfur capture and a single Siemens Westinghouse (SW) 501 G gas turbine. Using <b>carbonizer</b> and gas turbine data generated by Foster Wheeler (FW) and SW respectively, Parsons Infrastructure & Technology prepared preliminary plant heat and material balances based on <b>carbonizer</b> operating temperatures of 1700 and 1800 F and found the former to yield the higher plant efficiency. As a result, 1700 F has been selected as the preferred operating condition for the <b>carbonizer.</b> The 501 G gas turbine has an air compressor discharge temperature of 811 EF and an exhaust temperature of 1140 F. Both of these streams represent high sources of heat and must be cooled, the air to 600 F to be compatible with a 650 F PCFB pressure vessel design temperature and the exhaust for a 275 F stack gas temperature. Because of their relatively high temperature, {{they can be used}} for feed water heating, steam generation and/or steam superheating and reheating. As a result, the plant could have one boiler (the PCFB boiler), or as many as three boilers if their cooling is used to generate steam. If the two streams are used to heat feed water, the feed water flow must be increased to absorb this heat while staying below the boiling point, and the steam turbine output increases; this decreases both the gas turbine to steam turbine power ratio and plant efficiency. If the feed water flow is reduced, these streams are used for steam generation and superheating; the steam throughput/output decreases and plant efficiency is maximized. Three different plant arrangements using one, two and then three boilers were considered.

40|$|High {{efficiencies}} can {{be obtained}} from combined cycle power plants where fuel gas produced in a <b>carbonizer</b> is used to power the topping cycle turbines, while the residual char is burnt to raise steam for the bottoming Rankine cycle plant. Illinois coals are excellent fuels for these high efficiency power plants as the sulfur in the fuel gas is removed in the carbonization process by adding dolomite, thus producing a clean burning fuel gas. The residual char has essentially no volatiles, and is of low density. Because of these characteristics the char requires a longer residence time for efficient combustion. This research is directed towards improving the residence time of the char by pelletizing it with a waste coal, {{while at the same time}} reducing the sulfur dioxide emissions from the char combustion. During this quarter, extensive experimentation has been performed to determine the char-gob waste proportions necessary for forming pellets with desirable compression strength for feeding into the circulating fluidized bed combustor. <b>Carbonizer</b> char-gob coal pellets have been made with 5, 10 and 15 weight percent of cornstarch binder. Based on the test data presented, it is concluded that 10 [...] 15 % weight percent of binder will be required when pelletizing char-gob coal waste mixtures containing 30 - 40 percent by weight of gob coal. During the next quarter, these pellets will be made in larger quantities and their combustion and emissions properties will be evaluated in a bench scale 4 -inch diameter circulating fluidized bed combustor...|$|E

The latter includes a plant auxiliary load estimated to be 23. 48 MWe or 5. 26 % of the gross plant power and a transformer loss of 1. 52 MWe. Coal drying is through natural gas combustion, and the thermal energy input of the natural gas has also {{been included in the}} heat rate calculation. Figure 1 presents the plant preliminary full load heat and material balance.

Although this circuitry arrangement appears workable at full load, minimum load must be checked next to see if rearrangement is needed. Plant start up and load following discussions indicated that below about 15 percent gas turbine load, the latter would transition from steam to air cooling.

40|$|The {{advanced}} pressurized {{fluidized bed}} combustor (APFBC) power plant combines an efficient gas-fired combined cycle, a low-emission PFB combustor, and a coal pyrolysis unit (<b>carbonizer)</b> that converts coal, America`s most plentiful fuel, into the gas turbine fuel. From an operation standpoint, the APFBC plant {{is similar to}} an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant, except that the PFBC and fluid bed heat exchanger (FBHE) allow a considerable fraction of coal energy to be shunted around the gas turbine and sent directly to the steam turbine. By contrast, the fuel energy in IGCC plants and most other combined cycles is primarily delivered to the gas turbine {{and then to the}} steam turbine. Another characteristic of the APFBC plant is the interaction among three large thermal inertias [...] <b>carbonizer,</b> PFBC, and FBHE [...] that presents unique operational challenges for modeling and operation of this type of plant.
