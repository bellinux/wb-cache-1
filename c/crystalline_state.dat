5|$|After World War II {{work on the}} {{synthesis}} of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. George William Gray, a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid <b>crystalline</b> <b>state</b> and developed {{a better understanding of}} how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the University of Cincinnati and later at Kent State University. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world’s top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.|$|E

For polar molecules these <b>crystalline</b> <b>states</b> will be long-lived, assisting in a characterization of the state via the measurement of correlation functions. We also show that as the coupling strength increases in the model, the crystalline order is broken. This is characterized in 1 D by a change in density-density correlation functions, which decay to a constant in the crystalline regime, but show different regions of exponential and algebraic decay for larger coupling strengths...|$|R

That eminent chemist was the first who {{drew attention to the}} distinction which may be made of all substances into two classes, termed by him crystalloids and colloids; or rather, of all states of matter into the crystalloid and the colloidal states, for many substances are capable of existing in either. When in the colloidal state, their sensible properties are very {{different from those of the}} same substance when crystallized, or when in a state easily susceptible of crystallization. Colloid substances pass with extreme difficulty and slowness into the <b>crystalline</b> <b>state,</b> and are extremely inert in all the ordinary chemical relations. Substances in the colloid state are almost always, when combined with water, more or less viscous or gelatinous. The most prominent examples of the state are certain animal and vegetable substances, particularly gelatine, albumen, starch, the gums, caramel, tannin, and some others. Among substances not of organic origin, the most notable instances are hydrated silicic acid, and hydrated alumina, with other metallic peroxides of the aluminous class.|$|E

Sub-oxides of Zr are formed during the initial stages of oxidation of Zr (at oxygen exposures < 10 L), while at higher exposures, ZrO 2 is formed together with the highest possible sub-oxide which the authors designate as 'ZrO'. The relative proportion of 'ZrO' goes through a maximum in the range 25 - 50 L. Both the glassy and the <b>crystalline</b> <b>states</b> of the Cu-Zr alloys exhibit preferential oxidation of Zr. The glassy alloys exhibit a higher rate of oxidation at intermediate exposures compared with the <b>crystalline</b> <b>states</b> of the alloys; the extent of oxidation at higher oxygen exposures is, however, higher for crystalline alloys.

Applying to crystals, however, the laws encounter undefined properties of crystal lattices, which therefore {{need to be}} determined for a clear and well-defined description of <b>crystalline</b> <b>states.</b> Thermodynamics of <b>Crystalline</b> <b>States</b> explores the roles played by order variables and dynamic lattices in crystals in a wholly new way.

In the third part, the multi-electron system is discussed theoretically, as a quantum-mechanical example, for the superconducting state in metallic crystals. Throughout the book, the role played by the lattice is emphasized and examined in-depth. Thermodynamics of <b>Crystalline</b> <b>States</b> is an introductory treatise and textbook on mesoscopic phenomena in solid states, constituting a basic subject in condensed matter physics.
