40|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} is {{an important}} concern when {{a high percentage of}} Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) is used in an asphalt mixture. The aging of the asphalt binder reduces its ductility and makes the pavement more susceptible to cracking. Rejuvenators are often added to high-RAP mixtures to enhance their performance.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} {{geometry}} constraint on ductile fracture is qualitatively {{known in the}} literature. Lower constraint will increase the <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> curve, and vice versa. The traditional use of fracture mechanics specimens with high geometry constraint often leads to very conservative results when the <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> curves are used for failure assessment analyses of low constraint geometries. In this paper <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> curves are studied {{as a function of}} the T-stress. It is demonstrated that ductile <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> curves can be normalised by the T stress. The work is based on J-R curves obtained by FE analyses using different ductile damage models, and experimental verification by testing of three different geometries of an aluminium alloy (7108). This finding implies that the T stress is also controlling the ductile fracture. A materials resistance curve can be separated into a reference material resistance curve, which is transferable, and a geometry factor, which is a function of the T stress. The results indicate that the materials <b>crack</b> <b>resistance</b> curve can be found for all different geometries and loading conditions if the T stress is known. Many solutions for the T-stress for different geometries exist in the literature.
