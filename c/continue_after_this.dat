In November 1984, an allowance was introduced if the parent concerned had been employed for two or more years. Known as the “allocation parentale d’education,” this allowance provided 1,000 francs per month for parents who decided to take two years of parental leave after the birth of their first child. The “allocation au jeune enfant,” introduced in January 1985, was paid to all families at a flat rate for each child from the third month of pregnancy for nine months, regardless of the parents’ income. Payment was to <b>continue</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> period for 8 out of 10 families for a further 32 months on a means-tested basis.

Data analysis and publication of the results will <b>continue</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> grant has ended. A first analysis of pointed ROSAT observations has revealed that besides the regular accretion a hitherto unknown burst-like accretion onto magnetic white dwarfs exists.

40|$|Background: As {{a kidney}} {{transplant}} recipient I {{have long been}} exposed to a shortage of renal narratives and to a dominant theme in those that exist: transplant as restitution or redemption. My lived experience has, however, shown me that post-transplant life is more complex. Even after transplantation, chronic kidney disease requires lifelong health care {{with varying degrees of}} impairment, resulting in ongoing liminality for those who experience it. Nonetheless, as a transplant recipient I find the restitution or redemptive narrative pervasive and difficult to escape. Objective: I examined two seemingly very dissimilar insider renal biographies, Janet Hermans’s Perfect match: A kidney transplant reveals the ultimate second chance, and Steven Cojocaru’s Glamour, interrupted: How I became the best-dressed patient in Hollywood, to explore how the narrators treat chronic kidney disease and transplantation. Methods: In addition to a close textual reading of the biographies, I used my own experience of meaning-making to problematize concepts around restitution or redemptive narratives. Results: I found that the two biographies are, despite appearances and despite the attempts of one author to escape the redemptive form, very much the same type of narrative. The accounts end with the transplant, as is common, but the recipients’ lives <b>continue</b> <b>after</b> <b>this,</b> as they learn to live with their transplants, and this is not addressed. Conclusions: Emphasising restitution or redemption might prevent an understanding of post-transplant liminality that has unique characteristics. The narrator evading this narrative form must come to terms with a changed identity and, sometimes, fight to evade the pervasive narratives others impose...|$|E
40|$|Some {{people believe}} that betting and {{gambling}} {{will be one of}} the major parts of mobile commerce (m-commerce). Many betting situations are dependent on correct and timely information. This information does not necessarily have to be formalized. This is one of the reasons why people who bet at a trotting track is an interesting group to study. One other interesting aspect of this is that the track is a mobile context, which the player visits for a limited time and during this visit wanders between different places. The purpose of this master thesis is to answer the following question: is a mobile information service a way to lower the transaction costs for retrieving information connected to gambling at a trotting track. The theoretical framework is based on theories from e-commerce, marketing and mobility and mobile IT use. In order to answer our question we have conducted an ethnographical inspired study at the Åby Trotting Track in Mölndal. Our results have indicated that there are two general types of information, official and unofficial. It is also possible to divide the players into two general categories depending on the number of information sources used and how this information was used in order to make the betting decision. One another important finding is that there is a need for a personalization of the information that origins from official channels. Based on our findings we have conducted the first two steps in developing a prototype. A web based trotting service (Trotting Pal) designed for Ipaq handheld computers has been designed. The development of this prototype will <b>continue</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> master thesis has been completed. From our results we draw the conclusion that a mobile service can lower the transaction costs that arise in connection to information search. A mobile service also gives the possibility to personalization of the official information and at the same time makes it easier to spread and obtain unofficial information...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to find a}} new gasket {{material}} to be used in frequency converters manufactured by ABB. The new material has to comply to RoHS directive, because this material is going to replace the currently used material, which is not RoHS compliant. The material is going to be used in conditions, where it may be subjected to chemicals and especially oils, so it should have a good resistance to both. In addition to finding the material, this thesis considers factors affecting elastomer’s swelling in oil. Some requirements were set for the gasket material. The hardness of the material should not be over 60 Shore A and its tear strength should not be less than 23 kN/m. The material should also have a fire classification minimum of V 1. The most important criterion was the oil resistance. Gasket material should not swell more than 25 percent from its initial volume when immersed in oil. The literature part of this thesis consists of introducing four material groups which have such properties which are required from the gasket material and considers those properties. These four groups are thermoplastic polyurethanes, styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene, thermoplastic vulcanizate elastomers and co-polyester based elasto-mers. The literature part also discusses the factors which help estimate the amount of swelling based on the structure of the thermoplastic elastomer. The experiment part of this thesis introduces immersion tests which have been used to determine oil resistance of the test materials. Six materials were tested, the names of the materials are confidential, they are coded to be Materials A, B, C, D, E and F. From these results, the best suited material for the new gasket material was elected. Also from the results, it was possible to determine dependence of swelling on volume, area, vo-lume/area ratio and density of the sample. One suitable material was found in addition to a few others that require more test-ing. The only geometrical factor found to contribute materials swelling was volume/area ratio. Once the graph is made for a certain material, it helps to predict the swelling of a sample with a certain volume/area ratio made from the same material. The tests made for this thesis will <b>continue</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> thesis is completed. Some new sample geometries and new materials will be tested. /Kir 1...|$|E

40|$|Magister Administrationis - MAdminThe {{shift from}} an ethnocentric, monocultural society {{to a more}} {{inclusive}} and democratic society should {{be accompanied by a}} national policy providing equal access to resources in a proactive, affirmative manner. This can be achieved in one of the two ways, either through equal employment opportunity or Affirmative Action. Affirmative Action is a specific intervention directed toward ensuring that employment opportunities are created by actively correcting imbalances caused by past discrimination and achieving employment targets. Equal employment opportunity implies an absence of discrimination, whereas Affirmative Action denotes compensatory discrimination in favour of disadvantaged groups. Affirmative Action is a supplement to, rather than equivalent to equal employment opportunities in that equality cannot be a genuine option where the effects of previous discriminatory practices have not been redressed. In an equal opportunities system, not all persons have the same chance of achieving the desired goal, but all are provided with equal means to achieve it. The unequal outcome of such a system is caused by the unequal skills for talents of the past discrimination, especially in terms of education and experience. All the Directors of Tygerberg Administration who responded to the questionnaires supported this and all of them agreed that training is necessary for all employees, especially the previously discriminated groups. The primary objective of Affirmative Action can therefore said to be the adequate advancement of disadvantaged groups for the purpose of securing equal rights, freedom and opportunities. Equal employment opportunity is seen as a passive agreement {{on the part of the}} employer not to discriminate against any particular group. Employers adhering to the principle of equal employment opportunity evaluates candidates for employment according to performance criteria which relates directly to the requirements of a particular position. Affirmative Action seeks to go beyond equal employment opportunity in that it recognises that, when members of disadvantaged groups constitute only a small percentage of the labour pool, passively providing equality of opportunity will not suffice in overcoming the effects of previous discriminatory employment practices. Affirmative Action employers are therefore given the mandate to identify and remove the barriers to the employment of those under-represented in the workplace. Merely removing the present obstacles to equality does not necessarily ensure equality between groups since the effects of previous discrimination need to be actively redressed. It can be noted that equal employment and Affirmative Action programmes should not be equated with each other as they imply different approaches to overcoming the effects of previous discrimination. Affirmative Action is said to be a supplement to, rather than the equivalent of equal employment opportunity, in that it is required to eliminate the barriers to real equality in the workplace. In this regard, it is essential to point out that Affirmative Action programmes are a means to an end, namely equal employment opportunity, and should not <b>continue</b> <b>after</b> <b>this</b> end has been achieved. Due to the similarity between the two terms, Affirmative Action and equal employment opportunity are often equated with one another when, in essence, they have different meanings. From the information gathered for this research it was clear that not many Blacks were employed in management and supervisory positions of the City of Tygerberg. The research revealed that despite adopting the Agreement on Affirmative Action and equal employment practice of the National Labour Relations Forum for Local Government as its policy framework, the Tygerberg Administration had not succeeded in meeting most of its obligations in terms of the above mentioned policy framework. This is largely ascribed to problems experienced with the implementation of equal employment and Affirmative Action programmes within the local authority. The methods of communicating these programmes to especially its lower category of disadvantaged employees to participate in training opportunities to improve their working skills, were not capitalised on. There was an unequal distribution of skills due to the effects of past discrimination, especially in terms of education. Active steps therefore need to be taken to ensure that the intentions of the local authority with repect to equal employment and Affirmative Action are implemented efficiently and effectively.
