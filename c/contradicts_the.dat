5|$|According to Njal's Saga, Óspak was on {{the wing}} {{opposite}} King Sigtrygg Silkbeard. Óspak went through the entire battle on this wing, and was sorely wounded and lost both his sons before Sigtrygg fled. However, that Óspak engaged Sigtrygg <b>contradicts</b> <b>the</b> historical opinion that Sigtrygg did not actually {{take part in the}} battle but was instead holding the garrison in reserve in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{there is}} a {{divergence}} in the classical sources as to the course of events which cannot be reconciled until the entry of Marcus Licinius Crassus into the war. The two most comprehensive (extant) histories of the war by Appian and Plutarch detail very different events. However, neither account directly <b>contradicts</b> <b>the</b> other, but simply reports different events, ignoring some events in the other account, and reporting events that are unique to that account.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{study by}} Ragna Redelstorff e.a. {{concluded}} that the bone histology of Kentrosaurus indicated {{that it had a}} higher growth rate than reported for Stegosaurus and Scutellosaurus, in view of the relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone. As Stegosaurus was larger than Kentrosaurus, this <b>contradicts</b> <b>the</b> general rule that larger dinosaurs grew quicker than smaller ones.|$|E

5|$|There are {{symmetrical}} {{differences between}} the left- and right-hand sides of the painting. This is most noticeable with the buttress, where the receding edges are over half again the size {{of those on the}} front sides. In addition, the breadth of the buttress <b>contradicts</b> <b>the</b> spatial depth of the much tighter space inhabited by the Virgin and Child. This is a technical issue with foreshortening Campin also struggled with, but which van der Weyden resolves in his mature work.|$|E
5|$|A 24-million-year-old fossil {{belonging}} to Triturus, perhaps a marbled newt, {{shows that the}} genus already existed {{at that time and}} <b>contradicts</b> <b>the</b> earlier estimate of 8.3 million years ago (mya) for the split between the crested and marbled newts and their sister genus, the European brook newts (Calotriton). An age calibration study based on this and other fossils places that divergence much earlier, at around 39 mya in the Eocene, with an uncertainty range of 47 to 34 mya. Based on this estimation, authors have investigated diversification within the genus and related it to paleogeography: The crested and marbled newts split between 30 and 24 mya, and the two species of marbled newts have been separated for 4.7–6.8 million years.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 2014, Swiss voters {{narrowly}} {{approved by}} 50.3% a ballot initiative {{launched by the}} national conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) to restrict immigration, and thus reintroducing a quota system on the influx of foreigners. This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals) and suburban agglomerations (51.2% approvals), and isolated towns (51.3% approvals) of Switzerland {{as well as by}} a strong majority (69.2% approval) in the canton of Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% rejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) of Switzerland rather rejected it. Some news commentators claim that this proposal de facto <b>contradicts</b> <b>the</b> bilateral agreements on the free movement of persons from these respective countries.|$|E

5|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to prove their}} clients' innocence. In order to do so, they cross-examine witnesses; during these cross-examinations, the player aims to find lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies. They are {{able to go back}} and forth between the different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that <b>contradicts</b> <b>the</b> statement. In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands, and in the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence by swinging the Wii Remote. At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Phoenix's claims. On the screen, a number of exclamation marks are shown; if the player presents an incorrect piece of evidence, one of the exclamation marks disappear. If all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart. When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, {{state that}} Deusdedit died on 14 July 664. The main argument was {{put forward by}} Grosjean, who claimed that Bede had the consecration date wrong, as 26 May was Maundy Thursday in 655, not a date that would normally have been chosen for a consecration. Grosjean argues that the best method for resolving the conflicts is to just take 14July 664 as the date of death, and figure backwards with the length of reign given by Bede, which gives a consecration date of 12March 655. Thacker and Abels agree generally, although Thacker does not give a specific consecration date beyond March. Abels adds to Grosjean's arguments Bede's association of Deusdedit's death with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as occurring on the same day. Bede states that the plague of 664 began soon after the eclipse on 1May. Nothing in Bede <b>contradicts</b> <b>the</b> date of 14July 664 for Eorcenberht; therefore, Abels considers that date {{to be the best}} fit for the available data. The historian D. P. Kirby agrees that Deusdedit died in 664, although he does not give a precise date within that year.|$|E
