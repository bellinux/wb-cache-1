A variety of methods have been proposed in the literature, many of which include an elevated pressure of hydrogen gas, an increased temperature, or both. With the motivation of being less volatile and potentially result in a higher hydrogen concentration than with autoclave and gas pressure methods, cathodic charging is also an established method. Issues concerning hydrogen charging have been raised. These issues are the outgassing of charged hydrogen when the sample {{is removed from the}} <b>charging</b> <b>reactor,</b> structural degradation of the metal due to the cathodic charging, and that the charging only introduces hydrogen within the surface layer of the samples. A cathodic charging procedure of nickel based superalloy IN 718 was performed and evaluated as a method of introducing hydrogen to tensile test samples. Different charges were performed, two months apart. The charged samples were kept at room temperature before sent to analysis. The charging resulted in hydrogen concentrations in the samples of between 4. 50 - 6. 10 ppm, corresponding to an increase by 15 - 20 times compared to reference. No decrease in hydrogen content due to outgassing at room temperature could be revealed. One specimen was carefully lathed to different radii, and the hydrogen concentration was measured separately for each radius. SEM analysis showed that the corrosion and structural degradation are surface localized (Fig. 1 b) and the depth of the induced damage was estimated to < 15 μm. This damaged outer layer can readily be polished. Figure 1 a shows the un-charged reference.

40|$|Nowadays, about 1. 3 {{billion tons}} of food is wasted every year. This number, which is {{expected}} to increase greatly in the next decades, evidences the urgent need of improving the efficiency of the current food processing systems, supply chains, prevention policies and food waste (FW) disposal alternatives. Indeed, new FW treatment methods must be developed. At present, most of the FW is disposed in landfills or incinerated, whereas these organic matters could participate further in the recycling of resources. Anaerobic processes appear as a wellstablished alternative that allows, not only an effective waste treatment, but also its valorization by the generation of different added value products (i. e. methane, hydrogen, volatile fatty acids, lactic acid, ethanol, soil improver…). Due to the high total solids (TS) content of FW (around 20 %), it is possible to treat it by dry anaerobic digestion (AD) (> 20 % TS), a process with advantages when compared to traditional wet digestion (i. e. lower water requirement, lower digestate production and smaller reactor volume) (Karthikeyan and Visvanathan, 2013). In this study, the influence of the initial FW charge on the performance of a batch dry anaerobic codigestion system using FW and cardboard (CB) as substrates was evaluated. To do that, the FW charge was modified by varying three independent parameters: the initial TS content (20 - 35 %), the substrate to inoculum ratio (S/X) (0. 25 - 4 g VS·g VS- 1) and the FW:CB proportion in the substrate (50 : 50 - 80 : 20 g TS·g TS- 1). The experiments were carried out under mesophilic conditions (35 °C) and 13 different conditions were defined. The biogas production and composition were analyzed throughout an experimental period of 98 days and the concentrations of soluble metabolites and main ions were measured when the operation finished. The obtained results showed that the S/X ratio is a crucial parameter, determining the working pH of the system and therefore the final products. In fact, only the reactors working at an S/X ratio of 0. 25 (lowest FW charges) produced methane. The other conditions lead to accumulation of metabolites (volatile fatty acids-VFAs, lactate…) and hydrogen production. In addition, greater substrate conversions were achieved at low initial charges of FW. Moreover, the hydrogen yields were found to decrease when increasing the initial charge. This occurred because at high loadings, the acidification effect was more intense, inducing the accumulation of VFAs and lactic acid. This affected significantly the pH, decreasing the hydrogen and VFAs yields. This research suggested that dry anaerobic treatment of FW & CB could be an interesting technology for the production of different added value compounds, such as methane, hydrogen, VFAs and lactic acid. The generation of one product or another was found to be dependent of the initial charge of substrate. While low charged conditions lead to methane production and an efficient waste stabilization, high <b>charged</b> <b>reactors</b> produced hydrogen, VFAs and lactate. In those last cases, the waste stabilization was incomplete, with more than the 50 % of the input COD remaining in the digestate. However, the high yields of products suggested that this option could be interesting for a first reactor in a potential 2 -stage system with a final stage for waste stabilization by methane production...|$|R

50|$|In practice, {{sustaining}} a fission {{chain reaction}} with fast neutrons means using relatively {{highly enriched uranium}} or plutonium. The {{reason for this is}} that fissile reactions are favored at thermal energies, since the ratio between the Pu239 fission cross section and U238 absorption cross section is ~100 in a thermal spectrum and 8 in a fast spectrum. Fission and absorption cross sections are low for both Pu239 and U238 at high (fast) energies, which means that fast neutrons are likelier to pass through fuel without interacting than thermal neutrons; thus, more fissile material is needed. Therefore it is impossible to build a fast reactor using only natural uranium fuel. However, it is possible to build a fast reactor that will breed fuel (from fertile material) by producing more fissile material than it consumes. After the initial fuel <b>charge</b> such a <b>reactor</b> can be refueled by reprocessing.

40|$|The {{heterogeneous}} {{synthesis of}} the macrocyclic cyclopentadecanone (exaltone) starting from of the cheaply available hexadecane dicarboxylic acid (HDA) has been studied. Basic loaded, bifunctional catalysts like anatase and zirconium dioxide materials with high BET-surfaces were investigated for this intramolecular decarboxylation-dehydratisation reaction. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, CO 2 -TPD, ICP, SEM and EXD and tested on their suitability. Because HDA has a moderate solubility in THF all reactions were carried out in a liquid feed gas phase continuous flow reactor connected to a vacuum pump. The reactant mobility and desorption of the reactants from the catalyst surface and from the reactor walls can be successfully influenced by water, reduced pressure and high temperatures. Other parameters investigated were the amount of catalyst or carrier gas nitrogen (and therefore the residence time tau) or the catalyst loading. With a sufficient amount of catalyst (WHSV < 0, 225 g HDA×h 1 / g cat.) the complete conversion of HDA is possible at temperatures high enough (450 °C). TG-measurements show, as expected, a better desorption of high boiling organic compounds from the catalytic surface at higher temperatures. The most favourable temperature interval {{to carry out this}} kinetic controlled reaction lies between approximatively 400 °C and 450 °C. Calculations based on a computer model to the density-functional theory (DFT) complete this approach. The amount of catalytically active dopant (ca. 2, 7 wt% to 6, 6 wt%) had only a small effect in tests. At 450 °C 50 % selectivity was sporadically possible at 100 % conversion. Further runs with a loading of just around 0, 5 wt% sodium oxide achieved the best results because the agglomeration of the catalytic active sides on the surface could be prevented. The basic oxides like Li 2 O, K 2 O, Cs 2 O as well as BaO and CaO have shown catalytic activity in this reaction as well. By raising the amount of added water the results can be improved; conversions of 100 % at selectivities around 50 % are possible because of a better desorption of organic compounds from the catalyst surface. To observe the catalytic activity less catalyst was used (3 g, WHSV 0, 3 g HDA×h- 1 / g cat.) in two set-ups of similar type. Because sodium impregnated anatase catalyst however achieves conversions of more than 92 % and high selectivities of more than 67 % at 450 °C this material was in the further focus. Experiments with variable water or nitrogen rates and consequently different residence times have been carried out. In most cases a longer residence time causes a higher conversion and a lower selectivity, as expected. Variations in results are caused by measuring faults, unsteady pressure conditions as well as small variations in fixed bed <b>charge,</b> <b>reactor</b> geometry, output of the pump and work-up. By scaling up the experimental set up dimension blockades and inhomogenities can be reduced probably. Used akali impregnated catalysts can be regenerated by heating in oxidising atmosphere. The conditions of regeneration process have to be optimised. If the catalysts are recycled in the process a lower yield is observed. The conversion as well as the selectivity of the first run can not be achieved anymore. The Dieckmann-condensation of hexadecanedioic diester to exaltone as filed in the patent of W. Hölderich et al. has also successfully been tested with the reported catalytic systems. The addition of water has a positive effect on this reaction too. Finally a direct conversion of HDA to exaltone would be an enormous progress compared to other synthetic methods like ring-enlargement reactions (intramolecular En, Grignard reaction etc.) or ring-closing reactions (intramolecular acyloin-, Dieckmann-, aldol-condensation, Wittig reaction or metathesis) ...|$|R

Particularly GFR (Gas-cooled Fast <b>Reactor)</b> <b>charged</b> with some moderated DA (Dedicated Assemblies) could supply such requirements for transmutation process. Previously filled with MA, those DA are inserted in the active core pointing to the optimization and improvement in the reactor burning capability. Different configurations have been analysed to maximise reduction in MA amounts but with the constraint to maintain acceptable (from safety point of view) the β values. Two figures of merit have been adopted to evaluate the best solution: The ratio between the masses at EoC (End of Cycle) and at BoC (Beginning of Cycle) limited to the materials contained in DA and the same ratio considering the MA present in the whole core. Finally a “disposal” alternative option (with a longer storage time assumed before reprocessing MA) has been considered, too. Such preliminary optimization and the analysis of the obtained results are the main topics of the work...|$|R
40|$|Unprecedented {{demands for}} uniformity, throughput, anisotropy, and damage control in {{submicron}} pattern transfer are spurring development of new, low pressure, high <b>charge</b> density plasma <b>reactors.</b> Wafer biasing, independent of plasma production in these new systems {{is intended to}} provide improved ion flux and energy control so that selectivity can be optimized and damage can be minimized. However, as we show here, an inherent property of such discharges is the generation of significant densities of excited, metastable ionic states that can bombard workpiece surfaces with higher translational and internal energy. Absolute metastable ion densities are measured using the technique of self-absorption, while the corresponding velocity distributions and density scaling with pressure and electron density are measured using laser-induced fluorescence. For a low pressure, helicon-wave excited plasma, the metastable ion flux is at least 24 % of the total ion flux to device surfaces. Because the metastable ion density scales roughly as the reciprocal of the pressure and as {{the square of the}} electron density, the metastable flux is largest in low pressure, high charge density plasmas. This metastable ion energy flux effectively limits ion energy and flux control in these plasma reactors, but the consequences for etching and deposition of thin films depend on the material system and remain an open question...|$|R
40|$|Two {{hydrogen}} generators {{based on}} reactions involving magnesium and steam {{have been proposed}} as means for generating the fuel (hydrogen gas) for such fuel-cell power systems as those {{to be used in}} the drive systems of advanced motor vehicles. The hydrogen generators would make it unnecessary to rely on any of the hydrogen storage systems developed thus far that are, variously, too expensive, too heavy, too bulky, and/or too unsafe to be practical. The two proposed hydrogen generators are denoted basic and advanced, respectively. In the basic hydrogen generator (see figure), steam at a temperature greater than or equals 330 C would be fed into a <b>reactor</b> <b>charged</b> with magnesium, wherein hydrogen would be released in the exothermic reaction Mg + H 2 O yields MgO + H 2. The steam would be made in a flash boiler. To initiate the reaction, the boiler could be heated electrically by energy borrowed from a storage battery that would be recharged during normal operation of the associated fuel-cell subsystem. Once the reaction was underway, heat from the reaction would be fed to the boiler. If the boiler were made an integral part of the hydrogen-generator reactor vessel, then the problem of transfer of heat from the reactor to the boiler would be greatly simplified. A pump would be used to feed water from a storage tank to the boiler...|$|R

SOLUTION: A Pd salt (e. g. Pd acetate), a ligand (e. g. triphenylphosphine), and a solvent (e. g. toluene) are <b>charged</b> into a <b>reactor</b> to form a Pd complex having an oxidation number of 0 and represented by the formula: Pd(0) L L L L [wherein L to L are each a ligand such as PRR'R'' (wherein R, R', and R'' are each 1 - 14 C alkyl, etc.) ]. Then, a monomer (e. g. methyl methacrylate) is added to the reactor followed by the addition of a free-radical generator (e. g. CCl 4) in a molar ratio of Pd to the generator of 0. 01 - 100.; The contents in the reactor are heated to 40 - 90 deg. C and stirred for a certain time to conduct the polymn. The reaction mixture is diluted with toluene, etc., filtered, and condensed under a reduced pressure.

40|$|Pebble bed {{reactors}} {{fuel elements}} are specially suited for withstanding very high burn-up values. This {{is one of}} the main characteristics of a transmutation fuel. The higher the burn-up achieved in the fuel, the smaller the number of reprocessing steps needed for obtaining a high transmutation rate. In this paper, a new transmutation cycle option will be introduced, based in a single pass of the fuel through the reactor, with no reprocessing steps in the cycle. With a maximum burn-up of 700 MWth, the fuel transmuted is nearly 75 % of the actinides originally <b>charged</b> in the <b>reactor.</b> For a minimisation of the radiotoxicity in the fuel element, the 25 % of the mass of actinides remnant in the fuel after transmutation have to be low radiotoxic isotopes. For example, 242 Pu, which has a long half life, and by α disintegration, it converts to 238 U, beginning the Uranium cycle. In the paper, the optimum spectrum for minimising the final radiotoxicity is studied, and the possibility of initially drive the reactor as a critical reactor, with a last subcritical step, is analysed. In the calculations, it is shown that a good reduction in radiotoxicity of the fuel can be achieved by this strategy, with no reprocessing steps during the transmutation phase. The final disposal of the fuel elements, which have very good confinement characteristics, is also an additional factor for the use o...|$|R
