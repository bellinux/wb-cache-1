50|$|In telecommunications, a <b>cutback</b> <b>technique</b> is a {{destructive}} technique for determining certain optical fiber transmission characteristics, such as attenuation and bandwidth.|$|E
50|$|A {{variation}} of the <b>cutback</b> <b>technique</b> is the substitution method, in which measurements are made on a full length of fiber, and then on a short length of fiber having the same characteristics (core size, numerical aperture), with {{the results from the}} short length being subtracted to give the results for the full length.|$|E
5000|$|Since the {{attenuation}} {{is defined}} as proportional to the logarithm of the ratio between [...] and , where [...] is the power at point [...] and [...] respectively. Using the <b>cutback</b> <b>technique,</b> the power transmitted through a fiber of known length is measured and {{compared with the same}} measurement for the same fiber cut to a length of [...] approximately.|$|E

40|$|A focused {{ion beam}} (FIB) is used to {{sequentially}} reduce the contact length of an evaporated metal film to a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT). By using this FIB contact <b>cutback</b> <b>technique,</b> the contact resistance between an individual MWCNT and evaporated thin films of Au, Au/Ti, and Ag are accurately determined. The data permit a rational way to specify the minimum contact length of a metallic thin film to a MWCNT. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{transport}} {{properties of}} individual multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with diameters greater than 50 nm are investigated. MWCNTs grown by both {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) methods have been studied. ^ Electrical failure at high currents is observed and described in detail. Our {{results are consistent with}} a model of current transport in PECVD-grown MWCNTs that suggests current flow occurs predominantly through a majority number of shells. We infer that this behavior is due to the existence {{of a large number of}} defects in the MWCNT. ^ A correlation between growth temperature and electrical resistance of the MWCNTs grown by PECVD is established. The study identifies a temperature window for growing higher-quality MWCNTs with fewer defects and lower resistance by PECVD. A growth temperature near 900 °C is suggested as the most favorable temperature for the PECVD growth of MWCNTs. ^ Electrical contact properties between an individual MWCNT and a metal film are investigated using a novel laser ablation contact <b>cutback</b> <b>technique.</b> This innovative technique allows one to systematically and sequentially shorten the contact length formed by an evaporated metal film to a MWCNT. A semiclassical transport model is developed that allows estimates of the linear resistivity of the nanotube as well as the specific contact resistivity between the nanotube and metallic film. ^ The laser ablation contact <b>cutback</b> <b>technique</b> is significantly improved by using a focused ion beam (FIB). The FIB allows higher precision in cutting contacts than possible with laser ablation. This improved technique can be generally used to measure the specific contact resistance that develops between a metallic film and a variety of different nanowires and nanotubes. A systematic study shows that MWCNTs grown at 900 °C by PECVD have comparable electrical properties to MWCNTs grown by CVD. ...|$|E
40|$|A pulse {{propagating}} in {{an optical}} fibre returns scattered {{light to the}} source as an exponentially decaying waveform, the instantaneous slope of which yields the local attenuation at a corresponding point in the fibre. However, plots of local attenuation with length (the backscatter-loss signature) frequently exhibit severe fluctuations and anomalies such as negative values. We report here a study based on the newly-developed two-channel technique, aimed at verifying {{the accuracy of the}} average loss determined by backscatter measurements and correlating features in the signature with known fibre defects. In particular, a complete spectral backscatter attenuation measurement performed over a wide spectral range has been obtained, thus allowing an effective comparison to be made with that obtained by the conventional <b>cutback</b> <b>technique.</b> Furthermore, backscatter-loss signatures are presented which clearly show correlation with programmed fibre defects and indicate that, in contrast to the conclusions of ref. 2, in many cases diameter fluctuations are the cause of unidentified features in the backscatter waveform. Moreover, it is possible to infer the nature of the diameter variation from its loss signature...|$|E
40|$|The Russian Federal Nuclear Center-All Russian Research Institute of Technical Physics, {{located in}} the Nuclear City of Snezhinsk, east of the Ural {{mountains}} and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories have been investigating the possibility of establishing a commercial optical fiber manufacturing facility. These discussions began {{in the summer of}} 1998. At that time three samples (single mode and multi-mode) of optical fiber were left at the Sandia National Laboratory. Sandia measured two of the segments and sent them to LLNL. The optical loss at 1550 nm and 1300 nm were higher than commercially available fiber. The measurements were complicated because the geometry of the fibers also did not meet specification. Since the core was not adequately centered coupling of optical energy into the fiber being tested varied widely depending on which end of the fiber was used for insertion. The results of these measurements were summarized in the informal report dated June 11, 1999, which was hand carried by Dr. Paul Herman during his July 1999 visit. During the July visit a 1. 2 -km long section of graded-index multimode fiber, ITF 47, was given to Herman. We had requested samples longer than the earlier ones (which were {approx} 0. 1 km long) in order that a cutback method could be used for the transmission measurements. The optical loss using the <b>cutback</b> <b>technique</b> and the transmission spectral measurements in the 600 - 1700 mn region are reported. Also physical measurements are reported of the fiber's diameter, concentricity, ellipticity and tensile strength (proof test). The test results are summarized in Table 1, ''Comparative Data for Multi-mode Optical Fiber. '' The table includes the values from the Industrial specification TIA/EIA 402 AAAB, the commercial specification for Corning's 50 / 125 CPC 6, the values measured on ITF- 47 and provided by C- 70, and LLNL's values for ITF- 47 as well as the multimode values from the June 1999 samples...|$|E
