40|$|Objective: The {{mechanical}} properties of cells, {{which are the}} main characteristics determining their physical performance and physiological functions, have been actively studied {{in the fields of}} <b>cytobiology</b> and biomedical engineering and for the development of medicines. In this study, an indentation-vibration-based method is proposed to simultaneously measure the {{mechanical properties}} of cells in situ, including cellular mass (m), elasticity (k) and viscosity (c). Methods: The proposed measurement method is implemented based on the principle of forced vibration stimulated by simple harmonic force using an atomic force microscope (AFM) system integrated with a piezoelectric transducer (PZT) as the substrate vibrator. The corresponding theoretical model containing the three mechanical properties is derived and used to perform simulations and calculations. Living and fixed human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells were subjected to indentation and vibration to measure and compare their mechanical parameters and verify the proposed approach. Results: The results that the fixed sample cells are more viscous and elastic than the living sample cells and the measured mechanical properties of cell are consistent within, but not outside of the central region of the cell, are in accordance with previous studies. Conclusion: This work provides an approach to simultaneous measurement of the multiple mechanical properties of single cells using an integrated AFM system based on the principle force vibration and thickness-corrected Hertz model. Significance: This work should contribute to progress in biomedical engineering, <b>cytobiology,</b> medicine, early diagnosis, specific therapy and cell-powered robots...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{strategy}} to detect P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on cell membrane and quantify the cell number using electrochemical immunoassay {{was developed by}} effective surface immunoreactions and immobiliza-tion of cells on a highly hydrophilic interface, which was constructed by adsorption of colloidal gold nanoparticles on a methoxysilyl-terminated (Mos) butyrylchitosan modified glassy carbon electrode (Au-CS/GCE). Atomic force microscopy studies proved that the nanoparticles adsorbed on Mos-butyrylchitosan were efficient in preventing the cell leakage and retaining the activity of immobilized living K 562 /ADM leukemic cells. The incubation with P-gp monoclonal antibody and then the secondary alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugated antibody introduced AP onto the K 562 /ADM cell immobilized on Au-CS/GCE. The bound AP led to an amperometric response of 1 -naphthyl phosphate. Under optimal conditions the response was proportional to the logarithm of cell concentration {{in the range from}} 5. 0 104 to 1. 0 107 cells mL- 1 with a detection limit of 1. 0 104 cells mL- 1. The results were comparable to flow cytometric analysis of P-gp expression. This proposed method was practical, convenient, and significant in the clinic and <b>cytobiology.</b> Multidrug resistance (MDR) 1 is a major limiting factor to chemotherapy of cancer.

40|$|Herein, {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} and selective fluorimetric nanoprobe for peroxynitrite (ONOO-) detection based on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from ferrocene (Fc) to carbon dots (CDs) is reported. The nanoprobe (named CDs-Fc) can be facilely constructed through covalently conjugating CDs and ferrocenecarboxylic acid. Further studies {{reveal that the}} energy level of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the CDs is lowered {{with the addition of}} ONOO- due to its oxidation and nitration capabilities. Thus, an efficient electron transfer from Fc to the excited states of CDs could occur, leading to obvious fluorescence quenching. The fluorescence quenching of the nanoprobe was determined to be peroxynitrite concentrations dependence with a linear range between 4 nM to 0. 12 mu M. Thanks to the excellent optical properties of the CDs and efficient electron transfer efficiency from Fc to the excited CDs, the nanoprobe exhibits very high sensitivity to ONOO- with a limit of detection (LOD) of 2. 9 nM. To the best of our knowledge, this LOD is the highest reported value till today for the detection of peroxynitrite. Besides, the nanoprobe also shows excellent selectivity to ONOO- among a broad range of substances, even including other reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Finally, the nanoprobe was verified to be very low cytotoxicity, and was successfully applied for intracellular ONOO- detection. This work would provide a promising tool for the research of ONOO- in <b>cytobiology</b> and disease diagnosis...|$|E

The studies were conducted on 48 male Wistar rats. The animals were divided into eight groups: a control group and seven experimental groups. For 6  months, the animals in the experimental groups were administered a combination of drugs including rapamycin (Rapa), cyclosporin A, tacrolimus (Tac), mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone (Pred), according to the standard three-drug regimens for immunosuppressive therapy used in clinical practice. An evaluation of the morphology and ultrastructure was conducted, and a quantitative evaluation of the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and desmin- and cytokeratin-positive cells with weak, moderate, and strong expression was performed. The combination of Rapa, Tac, and Pred caused the smallest morphological and ultrastructural changes in the rat prostate cells. In the case of rats whose treatment was switched to Rapa monotherapy, a decreased percentage of proliferating cells of both the glandular epithelium and the stroma was found. Decreases in body weight and changes in the expression of cytokeratin and desmin were observed in all the experimental rats. The combination of Rapa, Tac, and Pred would seem to be the most beneficial for patients who do not suffer from prostate diseases. Our results justify the use of inhibitors of the mammalian target of Rapa in the treatment of patients with prostate cancer. The changes in the expression of cytoskeleton proteins may be the result of direct adverse effects of the immunosuppressive drugs, which are studied in this article, on the structure and organization of intermediate filament proteins.

These metabolites can modify {{the properties of the}} proteins, thereby affecting cell function, which is a possible explanation for the mechanism of immunosuppressive agents&# 39; toxicity. In our study, we evaluated the effect of two immunosuppressive strategies on protein expression in the kidneys of Wistar rats. Fragments of the rat kidneys were homogenized after cooling in liquid nitrogen and then dissolved in lysis buffer. The protein concentration in the samples was determined using a protein assay kit, and the proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The obtained gels were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and their images were analyzed to evaluate differences in protein expression. Identification of selected proteins was then performed using mass spectrometry. We found that the immunosuppressive drugs used in popular regimens induce a series of changes in protein expression in target organs. The expression of proteins involved in drug, glucose, amino acid, and lipid metabolism was pronounced. However, to a lesser extent, we also observed changes in nuclear, structural, and transport proteins&# 39; synthesis. Very slight differences were observed between the group receiving cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and glucocorticoids (CMG) and the control group. In contrast, compared to the control group, animals receiving tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and glucocorticoids (TMG) exhibited higher expression of proteins responsible for renal drug metabolism and lower expression levels of cytoplasmic actin and the major urinary protein. In the TMG group, we observed higher expression of proteins responsible for drug metabolism and a decrease in the expression of respiratory chain enzymes (thioredoxin- 2) and markers of distal renal tubular damage (heart fatty acid-binding protein) compared to expression in the CMG group. The consequences of the reported changes in protein expression require further study. Keywords: Proteomics, drug effects, immunosuppression, rat...|$|E

Here, we investigated whether curcumin can modulate etoposide action in myeloid leukemia cells and in normal cells of hematopoietic origin. HL- 60 cell line, normal myeloid progenitor cluster of differentiation (CD) - 34 + cells, and granulocytes were incubated for 4 or 24  hours at different concentrations of curcumin and/or etoposide. Brown Norway rats with acute myeloid leukemia (BNML) were used to prove the influence of curcumin on etoposide action in vivo. Rats were treated with curcumin for 23  days and etoposide was administered for the final 3  days of the experiment. Curcumin synergistically potentiated the cytotoxic effect of etoposide, and it intensified apoptosis and phosphorylation of the histone H 2 AX induced by this cytostatic drug in leukemic HL- 60 cells. In contrast, curcumin did not significantly modify etoposide-induced cytotoxicity and H 2 AX phosphorylation in normal CD 34 + cells and granulocytes. Curcumin modified the cytotoxic action of etoposide in HL- 60 cells through intensification of free radical production because preincubation with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) significantly reduced the cytotoxic effect of curcumin itself and a combination of two compounds. In contrast, NAC did not decrease the cytotoxic effect of etoposide. Thus, oxidative stress plays {{a greater role in}} the cytotoxic effect of curcumin than that of etoposide in HL- 60 cells. In vitro results were confirmed in a BNML model. Pretreatment with curcumin enhanced the antileukemic activity of etoposide in BNML rats (1. 57 -fold tumor reduction versus etoposide alone; P< 0. 05) and induced apoptosis of BNML cells more efficiently than etoposide alone (1. 54 -fold change versus etoposide alone; P< 0. 05), but this treatment protected nonleukemic B-cells from apoptosis. Thus, curcumin can increase the antileukemic effect of etoposide through reactive oxygen species in sensitive myeloid leukemia cells, and it is harmless to normal human cells.
