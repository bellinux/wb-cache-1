5|$|Tropical Storm Arlene {{was a rare}} {{off-season}} {{tropical cyclone}} that hit <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas in May1981. Its formation was unusual, originating from a tropical disturbance that crossed from the eastern Pacific Ocean into the Caribbean Sea; few Atlantic hurricanes develop in this manner. On May6, a tropical depression developed, {{and the next day}} it became Tropical Storm Arlene near the Cayman Islands, three weeks {{before the start of the}} hurricane season. This marked the first Atlantic tropical storm in May since 1970's Hurricane Alma. Arlene moved northeastward throughout its life, bringing rainfall and locally gusty winds as it crossed <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> southeastern Bahamas. On May9, the storm dissipated when a large non-tropical storm absorbed Arlene. There were no reports of deaths or significant damage.|$|E

City landscapes include Old Havana, Trinidad, and Camagüey, all founded by early Spanish colonists in the 16th century.

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of systems that developed, only one {{tropical}} cyclone, the second hurricane, managed to make landfall during the season. It severely impacted areas of the Greater Antilles, particularly the Dominican Republic, before making subsequent landfalls on <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> U.S. states of Florida and North Carolina, with less severe effects. The estimated 2,000 to 8,000deaths caused by the storm in the Dominican Republic alone ranked it as one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history. No other storms affected any landmasses during the year, although the first storm damaged a cruise ship in open waters.|$|E

In October 1860 for instance, De Soto reported the interception at Sierra Morena, Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 African slaves. The captain and crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities, but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore {{and could not be}} retrieved.|$|E
5|$|Later on September23, {{the storm}} entered the Windward Passage, {{maintaining}} a broad circulation with well-defined banding and an eye-like feature. Little change {{occurred during the}} day; the storm made its fifth landfall near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with winds of 75mph (120km/h). The storm began {{to take a more}} northwesterly track in response to a mid- to upper-level high pressure area to the northeast and a mid- to upper-level low over the Yucatán Peninsula. Throughout its passage across Cuba, Georges maintained a well-defined outflow pattern despite having an ill-defined center.

5|$|The 1910Cuba hurricane, {{popularly known}} as the Cyclone of the Five Days, was an unusual and {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that struck <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States in October1910. It formed in the southern Caribbean on October9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October16, corresponding to Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. That same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeastern United States on its way out to sea.|$|E

5|$|The 1964 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured {{the highest number}} of U.S.-landfalling hurricanes since 1933. The season officially began on June15, and lasted until November30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season was slightly above average, with twelve total storms and six hurricanes. All of the hurricanes strengthened into major hurricanes, an event that had not occurred since 1930. The first system, an unnamed tropical storm, developed on June2, almost two weeks before the official start of the season. Striking Florida on June6, the storm brought localized flooding to portions of <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Southeastern United States, leaving about $1million in damage. The next storm, also unnamed, developed near the end of July; it did not impact land.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban macaw or Cuban red macaw (Ara tricolor) was {{a species}} of macaw native to the main island of <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> nearby Isla de la Juventud that became extinct in the late 19th century.

5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricanes Cleo, Dora, and Isbell {{combined}} were devastating to Florida. Cleo also brought destruction to {{portions of the}} Caribbean, especially Guadeloupe and Haiti. After moving inland, Cleo brought flooding to states such as Virginia. Overall, the storm caused 219deaths and about $187.5million in damage. Dora lashed much of North Florida and southeastern Georgia with hurricane-force winds, leaving five fatalities and around $280million in damage. In October, Isbell brought strong winds and several tornadoes to Florida, as well as flooding to <b>Cuba</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Carolinas. Isbell killed seven people and left approximately $30million in damage.|$|E
