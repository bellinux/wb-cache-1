Our study indicates that: (i) the ML method produces superior estimates when the <b>component</b> <b>densities</b> are “well-mixed”, while either algorithm provides good estimates for well-separated distributions; (ii) the FCM approach is almost always faster than the ML method; and (iii) initialization of the ML method with the output of FCM almost always improves both the run time and accuracy of the statistical estimates...|$|R

We focus here on estimating the model's mixing matrix. Traditional methods (FOBI, Kernel-ICA, FastICA) originating from the engineering literature have consistency that requires moment conditions without achieving any type of asymptotic efficiency. When based on robust scatter matrices, the two-scatter methods developed by Oja, et al. (2006) and Nordhausen, et al. (2008) enjoy better robustness features but have unclear optimality properties. The semiparametric approach by Chen and Bickel (2006) achieves semiparametric efficiency but requires estimating the k unobserved independent <b>component</b> <b>densities.</b> As a reaction, an efficient (signed-) rank-based approach has been proposed by Ilmonen and Paindaveine (2011) for the case of symmetric <b>component</b> <b>densities</b> that fail to be root-n consistent as soon as one of the <b>component</b> <b>densities</b> is asymmetric. In this paper, using ranks rather than signed ranks, we extend their approach to the asymmetric case and propose a one-step R-estimator for ICA mixing matrices. The finite-sample performances of those estimators are investigated and compared to those of existing methods under moderately large sample sizes. Particularly good performances are obtained when using data-driven scores taking into account the skewness and kurtosis of residuals. Finally, we show, by an empirical exercise, that our methods also may provide excellent results in a context such as image analysis, where the basic assumptions of ICA are quite unlikely to hold...|$|R

40|$|In speaker {{verification}} (SV) {{systems that}} employ a {{support vector machine}} (SVM) classifier to make decisions on a supervector derived from Gaussian mixture model (GMM) component mean vectors, {{a significant portion of}} the computational load is involved in the calculation of the a posteriori probability of the feature vectors of the speaker under test with respect to the individual <b>component</b> <b>densities</b> of the universal background model (UBM). Further, the calculation of the sufficient statistics for the weight, mean, and covariance parameters derived from these same feature vectors also contribute a substantial amount of processing load to the SV system. In this paper, we propose a method that utilizes clusters of GMM-UBM mixture <b>component</b> <b>densities</b> in order to reduce the computational load required. In the adaptation step we score the feature vectors against the clusters and calculate the a posteriori probabilities and update the statistics exclusively for mixture components belonging to appropriate clusters. Each cluster is a grouping of multivariate normal distributions and is modeled by a single multivariate distribution. As such, the set of multivariate normal distributions representing the different clusters also form a GMM. This GMM is referred to as a hash GMM which can be considered to a lower resolution representation of the GMM-UBM. The mapping that associates the components of the hash GMM with components of the original GMM-UBM is referred to as a shortlist. This research investigates various methods of clustering the components of the GMM-UBM and forming hash GMMs. Of five different methods that are presented one method, Gaussian mixture reduction as proposed by Runnall's, easily outperformed the other methods. This method of Gaussian reduction iteratively reduces the size of a GMM by successively merging pairs of <b>component</b> <b>densities.</b> Pairs are selected for merger by using a Kullback-Leibler based metric. Using Runnal's method of reduction, we were able to achieve a factor of 2. 77 reduction in a posteriori probability calculations with no loss in accuracy when the original UBM consisted of 256 <b>component</b> <b>densities.</b> When clustering was implemented with a 1024 component UBM, we achieved a computation reduction of 5 with no loss in accuracy and a reduction by a factor of 10 with less than 2. 4 % relative loss in accuracy...|$|R

To explain why, we illustrate the different sources of decoupling between component and ensemble feedbacks. We argue that the management of anthropogenic impacts on populations using component feedbacks alone is ill-advised, just as managing on the basis of ensemble feedbacks without a mechanistic understanding of the contributions made by its components and environmental variability can lead to suboptimal decisions.
