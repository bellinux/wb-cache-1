5|$|According to Dasgupta, {{the term}} yoga <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). Someone who {{practices}} yoga or follows the yoga philosophy {{with a high}} level of commitment is called a yogi (may be applied to a man or a woman) or yogini (traditionally denoting a woman).|$|E

5|$|Filters are {{required}} to operate at many different frequencies, impedances and bandwidths. The utility of a prototype filter comes from the property that all these other filters <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> from it by applying a scaling factor to {{the components of the}} prototype. The filter design need thus only be carried out once in full, with other filters being obtained by simply applying a scaling factor.|$|E
5|$|If the {{large-scale}} universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> from the simpler Copernican principle, {{which states that}} there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.|$|E
5|$|According to Pāṇini, a 6th-century BCE Sanskrit grammarian, {{the term}} yoga <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). In {{the context of}} the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the root yuj samādhau (to concentrate) is {{considered}} by traditional commentators as the correct etymology. In accordance with Pāṇini, Vyasa who wrote the first commentary on the Yoga Sutras, states that yoga means samādhi (concentration).|$|E

These {{calculations are done}} automatically in personal diving computers, based on the diver's recent diving history, which {{is the reason why}} personal diving computers should not be shared by divers, and why a diver should not switch computers without a sufficient surface interval (more than 24 hours in most cases, up to 4 days, depending on the tissue model and recent diving history of the user).|$|E
5|$|In {{professional}} concert {{sound system}} design, subwoofers {{can be incorporated}} seamlessly with the main speakers into a stereo or mono full-range system by using an active crossover. Such a system receives its signal from the main mono or stereo mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance. If the main sound system is stereo, the subwoofers can also be in stereo. Otherwise, a mono subwoofer channel <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> within the crossover from a stereo mix, depending on the crossover make and model.|$|E
5|$|The same {{algebraic}} equations <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> in {{the context}} of Lie sphere geometry. That geometry represents circles, lines and points in a unified way, as a five-dimensional vector X = (v, c'x, c'y, w, sr), where c = (c'x, c'y) is the center of the circle, and r is its (non-negative) radius. If r is not zero, the sign s may be positive or negative; for visualization, s represents the orientation of the circle, with counterclockwise circles having a positive s and clockwise circles having a negative s. The parameter w is zero for a straight line, and one otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Using {{the stellar}} spectrum, astronomers can also {{determine}} the surface temperature, surface gravity, metallicity and rotational velocity of a star. If {{the distance of}} the star is found, such as by measuring the parallax, then the luminosity of the star <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived.</b> The mass, radius, surface gravity, and rotation period can then be estimated based on stellar models. (Mass can be calculated for stars in binary systems by measuring their orbital velocities and distances. Gravitational microlensing has been used to measure the mass of a single star.) With these parameters, astronomers can also estimate the age of the star.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March 2010, an A-10 {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} of an aircraft with all engines powered by a biofuel blend. The flight, performed at Eglin Air Force Base, used a 1:1 blend of JP-8 and Camelina-based fuel. On 28 June 2012, the A-10 became the first aircraft to fly using a new fuel blend derived from alcohol; known as ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet), the fuel is cellulosic-based that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>derived</b> using wood, paper, grass, or any cellulose based material, and are fermented into alcohols before being hydro-processed into aviation fuel. ATJ is the third alternative fuel to be evaluated by the Air Force {{as a replacement for}} petroleum-derived JP-8 fuel. Previous types were a synthetic paraffinic kerosene derived from coal and natural gas and a bio-mass fuel derived from plant-oils and animal fats known as Hydroprocessed Renewable Jet.|$|E
