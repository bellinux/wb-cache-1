5000|$|Prunus angustifolia {{pronounced}} (PROO-nus an-gus-tih-FOLE-ee-uh), known commonly as <b>Chickasaw</b> <b>plum,</b> Cherokee plum, Florida sand plum, sandhill plum, or sand plum, is a North American {{species of}} plum-bearing tree. It was originally cultivated by Native Americans {{before the arrival}} of Europeans [...] While Prunus is the classical name for European plums, angustifolia refers to its narrow leaves.|$|E
50|$|Chickasaw plums tend {{to bloom}} {{early in the}} spring. Because they bloom early in the spring, before many other plants bloom, and require very little maintenance, they are often used in {{horticulture}} for ornamental use. They are found along many highways, especially {{in the southern part}} of the United States. The fruit is eaten by various animals. It also provides cover for nesting sites. Ripe fruits are slightly tart, but can be eaten or are sometimes made into jellies, desserts and preserves. Because of its attractive bark, small leaves and thin branches, <b>Chickasaw</b> <b>plum</b> is also sometimes used for bonsai.|$|E
50|$|The Cades Pond people heavily {{exploited}} the aquatic resources of their environment. Eighty-five {{percent of the}} 1500 individual animals used for food at one site came from aquatic habitats. Included were snails, clams, 12 species of fish, frogs, 7 species of turtles, 5 species of water snakes, alligator, 7 species of water birds, otter, and muskrat. Land animals consumed included deer, black bear, panther, opossum, rabbits, squirrel, skunk, rats, and foxes. Identified plant remains include hickory (especially mockernut hickory), pine nuts, acorns, <b>Chickasaw</b> <b>plum,</b> persimmon, and wild cherry (Carolina cherry laurel). There {{is no evidence that}} the Cades Pond people cultivated any crops.|$|E
50|$|Whistler {{was clear}} cut twice in succession. So {{it is not}} an old growth rain forest with 1,000s of species, but a mere {{plantation}} with only 100 species. The Oregon Grape Mahonia aquifolium (AKA hollyleaved barberry) http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=maaq2 and Highbush Cranberry Viburnum opulus were accidentally re-introduced as escaped landscaping plants, and may all be Oregonian Subspecies. All the wild Pacific crabapples Malus fuscawere AKA Pyrus rivularis Douglas and AKA Pyrus fusca were dug up by Pemberton Pioneers for grafting Rootstock. It is unclear whether the <b>Chickasaw</b> <b>Plum,</b> Prunus americana was indigenous, or introduced by Indigenous Transcontinental Trade Networks or later Western Contact. All the wild Plums were dug up too by Pemberton Pioneers for fruit trees to transplant and as rootstock. Once abundant on the forest floor, Lingonberry Vaccinium vitis-idaea is no longer found because of the loss of habitat through the clear cutting.|$|E
50|$|Sunflowers {{were the}} {{earliest}} crop planted in spring. Sunflowers were planted in clumps {{around the edges}} of fields. Maize was next planted. Indian planting techniques are called Three Sisters agriculture. About five seeds were sown in a low mound of soil. The mounds were spaced about five feet apart. When the maize plants were a few inches high, climbing beans and squash seeds were planted between the mounds. The large squash leaves shaded the soil, preserving moisture and crowding out weeds. The beans fixed nitrogen in the soil and climbed up the corn stalks as support. The Wichita, and possibly other southern peoples, planted or tended thickets of low-growing <b>Chickasaw</b> <b>Plum</b> trees separating and bordering their maize fields. Tobacco was planted in separate fields and tended by old men. Women did most of the other farming, although men assisted in clearing land.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chickasaw</b> <b>plum</b> grows 12 to 20 {{feet tall}} and 15 to 20 feet wide in an {{irregular}} shape. It is [...] "twiggy" [...] in nature, and has a scaly, almost black bark. Its branches are reddish with thorn-like, small side branches. In February, March, April and May, small white flowers blossom, 8-9 mm wide, along with red plums, up to 25 mm long. The flowers have five white petals with reddish or orange anthers. The plums are cherry-like and tend to be quite tart until they fully ripen. They ripen in late summer. It requires low to medium amounts of water to grow, and dry, sandy or loose soil. It grows best in areas with regular sunlight or areas of partial shade. In sunny areas, {{it will be more}} dense and colonize thickly. In areas of partial shade, it will be thinner and less dense, and each plant will be more spread out. P. angustifolia is very difficult to distinguish from Prunus umbellata, with which it hybridizes easily.|$|E
5000|$|Elevations on the {{grassland}} {{range from}} 3900 ft {{in the southeastern}} corner of the Carrizo Unit on the Oklahoma border to 6200 ft on Fallas Mesa in the northwestern art of the same unit. [...] Average annual precipitation on the grassland ranges from 12 in at La Junta to 17 in at Springfield. Summer temperatures are hot with the average high above 90 F; winters are cold with average low temperatures in January below 20 F. [...] Vegetation is mostly steppe and shortgrass prairie, although pinyon and juniper trees are found in rocky canyons and cottonwoods and willows grow near streams. Western soapberry and netleaf hackberry are common in some areas near canyon bottoms, {{as well as some}} larger Gambel oak. <b>Chickasaw</b> <b>plum</b> and fragrant mimosa are occasional on uplands within grass cover. A few ponderosa pines are found on cool, moist hillsides. Wildlife on the grassland includes pronghorn, prairie dogs, lesser prairie chickens, mule deer, elk, wild turkey, golden eagle, swift fox, and infrequent roadrunners. [...] Three hundred and twenty-eight species of birds, including many Eastern birds at the limit of their range, have been recorded in Baca County where most of the Carrizo unit is located.|$|E
40|$|A {{headspace}} solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) procedure {{based on}} five commercialised fibres (85 μm polyacrylate – PA, 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane – PDMS, 65 μm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene – PDMS/DVB, 70 μm carbowax/divinylbenzene – CW/DVB and 85 μm carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane – CAR/PDMS) is presented for {{the characterization of}} the volatile metabolite profile of four selected Madeira island fruit species, lemon (Citrus limon), kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa), papaya (Carica papaya L.) and <b>Chickasaw</b> <b>plum</b> (Prunus angustifolia). The isolation of metabolites was followed by thermal desorption gas chromatography–quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC–qMS) methodology. The performance of the target fibres was evaluated and compared. The SPME fibre coated with CW/DVB afforded the highest extraction efficiency in kiwi and papaya pulps, while in lemon and plum the same was achieved with PMDS/DVB fibre. This procedure allowed for the identification of 80 compounds, 41 in kiwi, 24 in plums, 23 in papaya and 20 in lemon. Considering the best extraction conditions, the most abundant volatiles identified in kiwi were the intense aldehydes and ethyl esters such as (E) - 2 -hexenal and ethyl butyrate, while in Chicasaw plum predominate 2 -hexenal, 2 -methyl- 4 -pentenal, hexanal, (Z) - 3 -hexenol and cyclohexylene oxide. The major compounds identified in the papaya pulp were benzyl isothiocyanate, linalool oxide, furfural, hydroxypropanone, linalool and acetic acid. Finally, lemon was shown {{to be the most}} divergent of the four fruits, being its aroma profile composed almost exclusively by terpens, namely limonene, γ-terpinene, o-cymene and α-terpinolene. Thirty two volatiles were identified {{for the first time in}} the fruit or close related species analysed and 14 volatiles are reported as novel volatile metabolites in fruits. This includes 5 new compounds in kiwi (2 -cyclohexene- 1, 4 -dione, furyl hydroxymethyl ketone, 4 -hydroxydihydro- 2 (3 H) -furanone, 5 -acetoxymethyl- 2 -furaldehyde and ethanedioic acid), 4 in plum (4 -hydroxydihydro- 2 (3 H) -furanone, 5 -methyl- 2 -pyrazinylmethanol, cyclohexylene oxide and 1 -methylcyclohexene), 4 in papaya (octaethyleneglycol, 1, 2 -cyclopentanedione, 3 -methyl- 1, 2 -cyclopentanedione and 2 -furyl methyl ketone) and 2 in lemon (geranyl farnesate and safranal). It is noteworthy that among the 15 volatile metabolites identified in papaya, 3 -methyl- 1, 2 -cyclopentanedione was previously described as a novel PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ) agonist, having a potential to minimize inflammation...|$|E
