5000|$|This sensor {{works because}} Infrared light is absorbed {{by a variety}} of gases at {{different}} wavelengths within the spectrum including methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen. To measure the concentration, a beam of light is emitted into the air sample. By measuring the difference between the input and output of the infrared beam, the sensor can determine the amount of the trace gases in the sample. [...] It is common for an infrared gas analyzer to have two configurations. The [...] "open design" [...] operates by shooting a beam of infrared light through the air outside of the sensor body. Meanwhile, the closed design works by sucking air into the sensor body measuring the concentration of trace gases inside of a sealed chamber. Usually, open sensors are placed within half a meter of the anemometer while closed sensors use a <b>collection</b> <b>tube</b> mounted inside the anemometer to get their air sample.|$|E
50|$|First of {{all human}} proteins, e.g. human semenogelin antigen, can be {{optional}} isolated and immunologically analyzed to quick-check {{for the presence of}} human seminal fluid. If this test shows a positive result, the same casework sample will be processed further. The first part of the differential lysis is carried out under mild conditions to gain the female DNA. Lysate of the epithelia cells is retained within the column even during heat incubation and moderate shaking. Upon centrifugation, the solution passes the column into the <b>collection</b> <b>tube.</b> The DNA lysate is further purified and used to generate an autosomal STR profile of the victim. To further obtain the male DNA which will identify the perpetrator, harsher lysis conditions will be applied afterwards to the very same filter column without the necessity of sample carriage in order to break open the retained spermatozoa. Due to the high yield of DNA, the chance of a successful DNA-profile by downstream analysis is significantly increased. This simple handling allows time savings and higher throughput in this manual process to improve crime solution rates and to speed up analysis of backlogged crime samples.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} of microRNAs (miRNA) as non-invasive diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers, {{as well as}} therapeutic targets, has recently been recognized. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of consistency in the methodology used, but to our knowledge, no study has described the methodology of sample preparation and storage systematically with respect to miRNAs as blood biomarkers. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the stability of miRNAs in blood under various relevant clinical and research conditions: different <b>collection</b> <b>tubes,</b> storage at different temperatures, physical disturbance, as well as serial freeze-thaw cycles. Blood samples were collected from 12 healthy donors into different <b>collection</b> <b>tubes</b> containing anticoagulants, including EDTA, citrate and lithium-heparin, as well as into serum <b>collection</b> <b>tubes.</b> MiRNA stability was evaluated by measuring expression changes of miR- 1, miR- 21 and miR- 29 b at different conditions: varying processing time of whole blood (up to 72 hours (h)), long-term storage (9 months at - 80 Â°C), physical disturbance (1 and 8 h), as well as in a series of freeze/thaw cycles (1 and 4 times). Different <b>collection</b> <b>tubes</b> revealed comparable concentrations of miR- 1, miR- 21 and miR- 29 b. Tubes with lithium-heparin were found unsuitable for miRNA quantification. MiRNA levels were stable for at least 24 h at room temperature in whole blood, while separated fractions did show alterations within 24 h. There were significant changes in the miR- 21 and miR- 29 b levels after 72 h incubation of whole blood at room temperature (p< 0. 01 for both). Both miR- 1 and miR- 21 showed decreased levels after physical disturbance for 8 h in separated plasma and miR- 1 in serum whole blood, while after 1 h of disturbance no changes were observed. Storage of samples at - 80 Â°C extended the miRNA stability remarkably, however, miRNA levels in long-term stored (9 months) whole blood samples were significantly changed, which is in contrast to the plasma samples, where miR- 21 or miR- 29 b levels were found to be stable. Repetitive (n = 4) freeze-thaw cycles resulted in a significant reduction of miRNA concentration both in plasma and serum samples. This study highlights the importance of proper and systematic sample collection and preparation when measuring circulating miRNAs, e. g., in context of clinical trials. We demonstrated that the type of <b>collection</b> <b>tubes,</b> preparation, handling and storage of samples should be standardized to avoid confounding variables influencing the results...|$|R
5000|$|Saliva testing {{also has}} {{specific}} uses in clinical and experimental psychological settings. Due to {{its ability to}} provide insight into human behavior, emotions, and development, {{it has been used}} to investigate psychological phenomenon such as anxiety, depression, PTSD, and other behavioral disorders. Its primary purpose is to test cortisol and alpha amylase levels, which are indicative of stress levels. Salivary cortisol is a good stress index, with increased levels of cortisol correlating positively with increased levels of stress. Cortisol levels rise slowly over time and take a while to return to base level, indicating that cortisol is more associated with chronic stress levels. Alpha amylase, on the other hand, spikes quickly when confronted with a stressor and returns to baseline soon after the stress has passed, making salivary amylase measurement a powerful tool for psychological research studying acute stress responses. Samples are usually collected from participants by having them drool through a straw into a <b>collection</b> <b>tube</b> while experiencing a stimulus, with samples taken every few minutes to record the gradual change in stress hormone levels. Because the collection of saliva samples is non-invasive, it has the advantage of not introducing further stress on the participant that may otherwise distort results. [...] In more specific studies looking at the link between cortisol levels and psychological phenomena, it has been found that chronic stressors such as life-threatening situations (example: diseases), depression, and social or economic hardship correlate with significantly higher cortisol levels. In situations where a subject undergoes induced anxiety, high cortisol levels correspond with experiencing more physiological symptoms of nervousness, such as increased heart rate, sweating, and skin conductance. Additionally, a negative correlation was discovered between baseline levels of cortisol and aggression. Salivary cortisol levels can thus provide insight into a number of other psychological processes.|$|E
40|$|Affirm â¢ VPIII Ambient Temperature Transport is {{a sterile}} {{ready-to-use}} system {{intended for the}} collection, transport and preservation of vaginal specimens for use only with the Affirm VPIII Microbial Identification Test. The Affirm VPIII Ambient Temperature Transport System (ATTS) should be used with those specimens where transport times are expected to exceed 1 h at ambient temperature (15 â 30 Â°C) or 4 h at refrigerated temperatures (2 â 8 Â°C). SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION One of the routine procedures {{in the use of}} the Affirm VPIII Microbial Identification Test involves the collection and stable transportation of a vaginal specimen from the patient to the laboratory. This can be accomplished using the Affirm VPIII Ambient Temperature Transport System. The Affirm VPIII Ambient Temperature Transport System is designed to stabilize the nucleic acid of Candida species, Gardnerella vaginalis and Trichomonas vaginalis during specimen transport at ambient temperature (15 â 30 Â°C) for up to 72 h. This system has also been qualified for transport use at 2 â 8 Â°C.

40|$|The fate {{of mercury}} in the {{treatment}} of hazardous waste by reverse-burn gasification was investigated. Mercuric chloride was loaded into coal char at a rate of 333 Î¼g/g and the char was subjected to reverse-burn gasification to determine if mercury would be vaporized in the process as it is in typical incineration processes. Two types of mercury vapor traps, Amberlite IR- 124 (a sulfur-containing cation-exchange resin) and triple-reverse-burned coal char (TRB Char), were examined for their ability to remove mercury vapor from the gasification reactor exhaust gas.
