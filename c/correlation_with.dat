5|$|Many {{genes are}} known to be {{involved}} in schizophrenia, each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression. The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> intelligence and no genetic <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> immune disorders.|$|E
5|$|The {{receivers}} {{are based}} on Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, with low noise amplifiers cooled to 15K, which have 20GHz bandwidths and provide 46dB of amplification. The signals are mixed with a local oscillator to reduce their frequency, prior to <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> an analog correlator. The system temperatures are between 55 and 75K.|$|E
5|$|Also {{attributable}} to Gasparo Cairano, and dated at this stage, is the singular St John the Baptist {{placed in the}} tympanum of the capitol of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog {{of the works of}} Cairano due to obvious <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E
30|$|Our second aim was {{to build}} on Waterman et al.’s (2010) {{foundation}} and further explore the scale’s external validity (convergent and discriminant) with specific focus on the attenuation corrected correlations between scores on the QEWB factors’ scores and scores on other well-being scales, {{as well as a}} measure of psychological dysfunction. Our hypotheses were supported: Convergent validity was confirmed by large positive <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> scores on other measures in the family of EWB, while discriminant validity was shown by medium to large (but consistently smaller) positive <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> scores on measures of hedonic well-being, the medium to large negative (but consistently smaller) <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> scores on a depression scale, and the small negative <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> search for meaning.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that self-oriented and {{socially}} prescribed perfectionism show differential relationships with intrinsic–extrinsic motivation and test anxiety, but the findings are ambiguous. Moreover, they ignored that test anxiety is multidimensional. Consequently, the present study re-investigated the relationships in 104 university students examining how the two forms of perfectionism are related to intrinsic–extrinsic motivation and multidimensional test anxiety (worry, emotionality, interference, lack of confidence, and total anxiety). Regarding motivation, self-oriented perfectionism showed positive <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> intrinsic reasons for studying, and socially prescribed perfectionism positive <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> extrinsic reasons. Regarding test anxiety, only socially prescribed perfectionism showed positive <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> total anxiety. Moreover, socially prescribed perfectionism showed positive <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> interference and lack of confidence, whereas self-oriented perfectionism showed positive <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> worry, but negative <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> interference and lack of confidence. The findings confirm that socially prescribed perfectionism is a maladaptive form of perfectionism associated with extrinsic motivation for studying and higher anxiety in exams. Self-oriented perfectionism, however, is an ambivalent form associated with intrinsic motivation for studying and with both higher and lower anxiety (higher worry, lower interference, lower lack of confidence) in exams...|$|R
30|$|The three {{subjective}} well-being {{components were}} more correlated with rumination indicating closer association among these variables. Negative affect produced significant <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> the three outcomes, while life satisfaction correlated significantly with anxiety. The four personality factors, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion, presented non-significant <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> rumination, PTSD symptoms, and anxiety pointing out low association among them. Neuroticism, and its facet depression, presented significant, and positive <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> the outcomes indicating depression symptoms are relevant predictors of rumination, PTSD, and anxiety.|$|R
5|$|In a genome wide {{association}} screen (GWAS), CASS4 {{showed a}} significant <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> clinical pathological features of AD such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. Two additional CASS4 SNPs were reported {{to be associated with}} AD susceptibility: rs6024870, and rs16979934 T/G. Given the likely conserved CAS-family cytoskeletal function of CASS4, it has been speculated that it may have a role in axonal transport and influence the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, which are pathologically affected in AD. Several possible mechanisms for CASS4 action in AD have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are thought}} to have evolved in Asia, where local multituberculate faunas were {{severely}} affected by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and never fully recovered, unlike their North American and European relatives. In the resulting ecological vacuum, rodents and other Glires were allowed to evolve and diversify, taking the niches left by extinct multituberculates. The correlation between the spread of rodents and the demise of multituberculates is a controversial topic, not fully resolved. American and European multituberculate assemblages do decline in diversity in <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> the introduction of rodents in these areas, but the remaining Asian multituberculates co-existed with rodents with no observable replacement taking place, and ultimately both clades co-existed for at least 15 million years.|$|E

5|$|The {{music and}} {{instruments}} in each level {{were chosen to}} correspond to the game world and the level's placement in the overall emotional arc. The music is composed of multiple layers of acoustic instrument tracks that rise and fall in <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> the player's actions. The instruments used include pianos, string instruments such as classical guitars, and woodwinds such as bass flutes and bassoons. The number of instruments playing increases in <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> the amount of petals that the player gathers. The music is meant to suggest natural sounds like wind. The instrument tracks were intended {{to be able to}} stand on their own, even when used in a large orchestrated group as in levels three and six. Several times in the development process, Diamante became so attached to a piece of music that needed alteration that he composed a new piece to replace it. Diamante was long in talks with Sony to produce an album of music from the game. On April 8, 2010 a soundtrack album was released by Sony for purchase on the PlayStation Network. The album, titled Flower: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game, contains 8 tracks with a total duration of 1:04:37.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} pleural space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction of vocal vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E

First, we construct a <b>correlation</b> function <b>with</b> a low and narrow main-peak using partial correlation functions. Then, we generate an unambiguous <b>correlation</b> function <b>with</b> a high and sharp main-peak via combinations of the <b>correlation</b> function <b>with</b> the partial <b>correlation</b> functions. From numerical results, {{it is observed}} that the proposed unambiguous <b>correlation</b> function <b>with</b> a high and sharp main-peak offers a better tracking performance than the conventional <b>correlation</b> functions <b>with</b> a low and flat main-peak in terms of the tracking error standard deviation...|$|R
40|$|Correlations between Big Five {{personality}} {{factors and}} other variables {{have been examined}} in three different ways: direct scoring of items within a factor, application of a composite score formula, and taking the average of single-scale correlations. Those methods were shown to yield consistently different outcomes in four sets of data from sales-people and managers. Factor <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> job performance were greatest for direct scoring, and were reduced by half when scale correlations were averaged. The insertion of previously suggested estimates into the composite score formula yielded intermediate <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> performance.

30|$|PCA was {{performed}} to facilitate a simple interpretation of the results obtained by the proposed system. The images clustered within the same species and they were apparently well dispersed in the score plots (Fig.  7). The cumulative contribution ratio of the first, second, and third principal components (PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3) was over 88 %, and the loadings for these three components are listed in Table  1. According to the loadings, the 30 texture features could be roughly divided to four groups: Group 1 had strong <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> PC 1; Group 2 had moderate negative correlations and strong positive <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> PC 1 and PC 2, respectively; Group 3 had strong <b>correlations</b> only <b>with</b> PC 2; and Group 4 had moderate <b>correlations</b> <b>with</b> both PC 2 and PC 3.|$|R
