50|$|The Code, as {{the product}} of private organizations, is not itself the law, but only a {{recommendation}} of the laws that should be adopted in the states. Once enacted by a state, the UCC is codified into the state’s code of statutes. A state may adopt the UCC verbatim as written by ALI and NCCUSL, or a state may adopt the UCC with specific changes. Unless such changes are minor, they can seriously obstruct the Code's express objective of promoting uniformity of law among the various states.

50|$|Intelligence {{and social}} {{structures}} makes most crow species adaptable and opportunistic. Crows frequently cause damage to crops and property, strew trash, and transfer disease. In densely populated {{areas around the}} world, corvids are generally regarded as nuisance animals. Crows are protected in the U.S. under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, but because of their perceived destructive nature, control of the species is allowed in certain areas. Because of their intelligence, control is often difficult or expensive. Methods for control include hunting, chemical immobilization, harassment and scare tactics, and trapping. Before any measure is used to confine, trap, kill, poison, immobilize, or alter the habits of any wild bird species, a person must <b>check</b> <b>local,</b> state, and federal regulations pertaining to such actions.|$|E

5000|$|Starting {{with the}} 1999 {{version of the}} National Electrical Code in the United States, and the 2002 version of the Canadian Electrical Code in Canada, the {{national}} codes require AFCIs in all circuits that feed outlets in bedrooms of dwelling units. As of the 2014 NEC, AFCI protection is required on all branch circuits supplying outlets or devices installed in dwelling unit kitchens, family rooms, dining rooms, living rooms, parlors, libraries, dens, bedrooms, sunrooms, recreation rooms, closets, hallways, laundry areas, and similar rooms and areas. They are also required in dormitory units. This requirement may be accomplished by using a [...] "combination type" [...] breaker—a specific kind of circuit-breaker defined by UL 1699—in the breaker panel that provides combined arc-fault and overcurrent protection or by using an AFCI receptacle for modifications/extensions, as replacement receptacles or in new construction, at the first outlet on the branch.

The early examination of computerized criminal history records enables the officer to identify which law enforcement, court, and correctional records must be reviewed. In addition, the initial interview of the defendant should include questioning about the offender's residential history so that the officer can <b>check</b> <b>local</b> police and court records in every jurisdiction where the defendant has lived. Additionally, the probation officer may request physical and mental health, educational, employment or financial records {{from a variety of sources}} to corroborate information provided by the offender.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} how two new high â-carotene sweetpotato varieties, Vita and Kabode were assessed against <b>local</b> <b>checks</b> by pregnant women (n= 79) and how young children (72) under 2 years of age liked them in Bungoma and Busia districts of Kenya.

The acceptance of the root texture of the <b>local</b> <b>check</b> in the two districts was higher than of the two new varieties (local check: 4. 00, Kabode: 3. 27, Vita: 3. 00).
