Eurocode is the common European set of struc-tural design codes which will replace BKR (Boverkets Kon-struktionsregler). BKR is the Swedish set of structural design codes that was used up until December 31 2010. For consulting firms this will cre-ate a need for them {{to invest in the}} standards and in education for the coworkers. This will involve both time and costs for the company. The purpose and aim of this master thesis is the development of compute examples and calculations aid by dimensioning with Euro-code. The content of the report consists of a short introduction of Euro-code; its description and its purpose. A short retrospective of the elderly structural designs and BKR. The main part consists of the <b>compute</b> <b>mode</b> for the different structural parts in different materials. Different expressions and coefficients will be explained. This master thesis is created {{to meet the needs of}} Byggkonsulten Widberg. Byggkonsulten Widberg is a consultant firm in Uppsala which carries out different structural assignments.

40|$|There {{are some}} {{problems}} in traditional interacting multiple model algorithms (IMM) {{when used in}} target tracking systems. For instance, the mode transition matrix is inaccurate and cannot be determined when the sojourn times are not known. To solve these problems, an optimal mode transition matrix IMM (OMTM-IMM) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The linear minimum variance theory {{is used to calculate}} the mode transition matrix which depends on the continuous system state rather than the sojourn times in this algorithm. Moreover, the correlation of the subfilter is considered; hence the covariance matrices are utilized to <b>compute</b> <b>mode</b> transition matrix. In this algorithm, the model probability is defined as a diagonal matrix which is combined with the filters outputs; thus the effects produced by each state can be distinguished. Finally, to verify the superiority of the new algorithm, the theoretical proof and simulation results are given.

40|$|Abstract—Private data {{comes in}} many forms: web browser histories, chat logs, {{sensitive}} word processor documents, net-work proxy logs, and many more. Some applications – pri-marily web browsers – now support private modes that aim to prevent sensitive information leaks. There are two {{problems with this}} application-level approach. First, there are many software engineering challenges in implementing correct and complete private modes. More fundamentally, applications cannot always tell which data is private – this {{is up to the}} user. As a result, applications that do support private modes may not implement the user’s desired policy, and many other applications that process private data do not have a private mode at all, because the developers did not consider that use case. In this paper, we present a case for private <b>computing</b> <b>mode</b> as a system service, rather than a per-application feature. We specify the threat model and the goals of the private <b>computing</b> <b>mode,</b> and argue that the applications alone cannot achieve these goals.

40|$|This work solves a fuel cell-battery {{hybrid vehicle}} (FCHV) power {{management}} problem using the embedding approach to hybrid (switched) optimal control problems. The FCHV is a switched system with three distinct modal configurations (modes) : electric motor propelling/battery discharging, propelling/charging, and generating/charging. Each powertrain mode {{has a distinct}} set of dynamics and constraints. A supervisory-level switched system power flow model is developed as an interconnection of powertrain subsystems using component dynamical/algebraic models appropriate to power flow management. Given the model, a hybrid model predictive control strategy is set forth based on a minimization of a performance index (PI) that trades off velocity tracking error, {{battery state of charge}} variance, and electric drive and hydrogen fuel usages while penalizing frictional braking to encourage regenerative braking. The embedding approach representation of the optimization problem is solved, after applying collocation, with MATLAB 2 ̆ 7 s fmincon to <b>compute</b> <b>mode</b> switches and continuous time controls. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology, an example mid-size sedan FCHV is simulated using five driving velocity profiles, which include three regulatory profiles. Drive cycle fuel consumption is shown to be lower than that from the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy, a popular power management strategy. Finally, mode and continuous control projection are required in the infrequent case when the embedding approach solution does not result in a switched system solution; the projection methods used during the simulations are justified with an empirical study. The study 2 ̆ 7 s goal was to identify which of the eight mode and control projection combinations tested results in the least error between the embedding approach solution and simulated switched system costs. ^ This work also demonstrates the superiority of the embedding approach over alternative methods for solving hybrid optimal control problems. The embedding approach is compared to multi-parametric programming, mixed-integer programming, gradient-descent based methods, and CPLEX in the context of five published examples: a spring-mass system, moving-target tracking for a mobile robot, two-tank filling, DC-DC boost converter, and a skid-steered vehicle. Results from the examples make clear the advantages of the embedding approach: lower performance index cost, generally faster solution time, and convergence to a solution when other methods fail. ...|$|E
