40|$|The {{travelling}} salesman problem (or The sales representative problem) has been insufficiently explored so far. One {{of the first}} results on this issue was provided by Euler in 1759 (The problem of moving a knight on the chess board), Knight 2 ̆ 7 s Tour Problem. Papers on this subject were written by A. T. Vandermonde (1771), T. P. Kirkman (1856) and many others. The sales representative problem is a major challenge due to the application in solving theoretical and practical problems such as the quality of algorithms and of optimization methods. This well-known optimization problem has been extensively studied from several aspects since 1930. In general form the study was started by Karl Menger, seeking the shortest route through all points of a finite set with known distances between every two points. Since then, {{there have been many}} formulations of the problem. In this paper we shall provide an analysis {{of the nature of the}} <b>commercial</b> <b>representative</b> problem, <b>and</b> highlight its complexity and some ways of its solution. We shall use graph theory, and pay particular attention to the search of Hamiltonian cycle of minimum weight in the weighted graph. During the paper development we were led by the following question: "How to minimize the total distance travelled by a sales representative in order to visit n given locations exactly once and return to the starting point?" Nowadays, there are many formulations of the <b>commercial</b> <b>representative</b> problem <b>and</b> we shall mention two equivalent formulations: a) 	A set of places that a sales representative has to visit exactly once and return to the starting point is determined, the distance between places being known. The question is in which order a sales representative should visit the places so that the total length of his tour is minimal b) 	A Hamiltonian cycle of minimum weight should be determined in the weighted graph. Note that the formulation of the problem is very simple, but finding solutions inflicts great difficulties. For a graph of n vertices there are n! maximum number of Hamiltonian cycles, thus the problem of factorial complexity occurs...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to develop a}} method by which {{economic}} value can be imputed from an economic activity to a non-market ecological function or service which contributes to that economic activity. The Knysna River in South Africa was chosen as the ecological function which supported three economic activities from which value was to be imputed; these were the Knysna Municipal Water Supply, Fish Production in the Knysna Estuary and Production of Indigenous Forest within the Knysna Catchment. Three underlying assumptions and two functional operations were required in order to implement the suggested method. The underlying assumptions were: - The ecological and economic activities considered are within a single catchment. - The allocation of value imputed for a specific economic activity to the ecological function or service under consideration (in this case the Knysna River) is proportional to the total contribution of ecological functions or services contributed to the economic activity. - The valuation of the economic activity for the purposes of obtaining a price-quantity point on a demand function is to be full cost pricing with no producer surplus. The two functional requirements were: - Diagram or map the linkages between an economic activity and the supporting ecological functions. - Determine the consumer surplus related to an incremental change in quantity under a demand function where the original price and quantity are known. A value from each of the economic activities was imputed to the Knysna River. However, the method was not tested. Nonetheless applying the equations and collecting the required data allowed several methodological needs to be clearly pointed out. The most acute deficiency was difficulty in obtaining secondary data from governmental agencies, <b>commercial</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>and</b> existing published academic research to ensure a robust price. Also, scientific information was not sufficiently available for allocating ecological contributions to the economic activities. Even with the shortage of credible data the method appears to allow non-market ecological functions to be valued in context of an existing economic system. ...|$|R

Many studies aimed at efficient RPC consist in either new implementations of the RPC paradigm or manual optimization of critical sections of the code. This paper presents an experiment that achieves automatic optimization of an existing, commercial RPC implementation, namely the Sun RPC. The optimized Sun RPC is obtained by using an automatic program specializer. It runs up to 1. 5 times faster than the original Sun RPC. Close examination of the specialized code does not reveal further optimizations opportunities which would lead to significant improvements without major manual restructuring. The contributions of this work are: (1) the optimized code is safely produced by an automatic tool and thus does not entail any additional maintenance; (2) {{to the best of our}} knowledge this is the first successful specialization of mature, <b>commercial,</b> <b>representative</b> system code; <b>and</b> (3) the optimized Sun RPC runs signifi [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{problems}} have been identified with the education of Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> pupils in schools (Bhopal, 2004; Warrington, 2007). Generally these have been articulated by policy makers, educational professionals and academics about Gypsies <b>and</b> <b>Travellers</b> communities; however, {{there is also a}} body of work that details Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> families’ concerns about their children’s education (Acton, 2004; Dean, 2007). Underachievement and poor attendance issues in particular have caused concern for education policy makers since publication of the Plowden report in 1967 (Plowden, 1967; Bhopal et al, 2000). As a result the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) has produced a number of publications aimed at raising the achievement and attainment of Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> pupils (DfEE, 1999; DfES 2003; 2006). Common concerns for Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> parents include fears their children will encounter racism and bullying at schools, fears around safety including using public transport, going on school trips or taking part in PE lessons, and engagement with culturally sensitive subjects such as sex education (Bhopal et al, 2000; Clark and Greenfields, 2006). Many Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> parents also feel their children do not receive the quality of education they are entitled to; sometimes reflecting the failure of schools to deliver a culturally appropriate curriculum and sometimes suggesting schools do not deliver educational provision of the same quality received by non-Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> children (Bhopal <b>and</b> Myers, 2008). Whilst it is apparent that there has been an increase in the numbers of Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> children attending schools, {{it is also clear that}} over the last fifty years many Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> children have not attended school. In most research undertaken about Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> children’s expectations of education since the 1960 ’s there are accounts of the bullying and racism they have faced (Liegeois, 1987; Reiss, 1975). This has been a consistent cause for families not to send their children to school. To date these issues have not been fully addressed and still reflect much that is commonplace despite continuing efforts to improve practice in schools (DfES, 2003, 2006). Therefore a management of the danger in ways that result in Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> children feeling that going to school is safe, even if it is understood within a context of the school being a potentially dangerous site, is a positive development if the intention is to improve Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> children’s educational outcomes. The perception of the school environment in this light in many ways reflects the context of Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> lives <b>and</b> their relations with wider society. Within this context, this paper will explore the most common problem identified by researchers as to the reasons why parents do not want to send their children to school – that of racism. The research will draw upon in-depth interviews conducted in one primary and one secondary school in an inner London borough. Both of the schools were the main receiving schools for the local Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> population. Close to the schools is a local council run Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> site which has been in the area for over 50 years. Interviews were conducted with heads, teachers, learning support assistants, parents and pupils. Despite race equality polices being in place in both schools, many of the pupils reported having experienced racism and these experiences not being taken seriously by teachers. One of the respondents indicated, ‘What about us? People don’t think anyone can be racist to us because we’re white. Those black people have their colour to show, what do we have?’ Many of the teachers also revealed overt racist attitudes towards Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> pupils <b>and</b> indicated that Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> children used their ethnicity as an ‘excuse’ so that they did not have to conform to school rules. Despite race equality policies being present in both schools, Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> continued to experience overt racism and many parents felt such racism was not dealt with effectively and not given the same attention as racism experienced by non-white groups. Drawing upon this research, the paper will address the following questions: 1. 	How is white racism defined by Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> groups? 2. 	How do schools deal with the racism experienced by Gypsy <b>and</b> <b>Traveller</b> groups <b>and</b> how does this in turn affect the educational experience of these groups? 3. 	Do what extent are Gypsies <b>and</b> <b>Travellers</b> ‘othered’ within schools? <br/...|$|R
