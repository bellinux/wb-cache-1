50|$|Apotemnophilia {{has been}} studied {{for a number of}} years to {{determine}} whether this disorder is actually neurological or psychological. However, in-depth research related to apotemnophilia and its correlation to the mind and body are still not clear. Recent research has shown small breakthroughs such that apotemnophiles are three times more likely to want removal of a left limb than right, in accordance with damage to the right parietal lobe, and also in concordance with sufferers of somatoparaphrenia; in addition, skin conductance response is significantly different above and below the line of desired amputation, and the line of desired amputation remains stable over time, with the desire often beginning in early childhood. Among a <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> 52 apotemnophiles recruited from internet groups, the great majority wanted a single leg removed, cut above the knee. There are parallels between apotemnophilia as a motivation for body integrity identity disorder and autogynephilia as a motivation for some cases of male-to-female gender dysphoria.|$|E
5000|$|A NicA pamphlet, Tips for Gaining Freedom from Nicotine, was {{reviewed}} in 1999 by a <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> twelve professional colleagues of psychologist Edward Lichtenstein.

To that extent, they also rated how consistent the tips were with current cognitive-behavioral cessation techniques. It was found {{that many of the}} tips were very consistent with modern cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation treatment programs. The cognitive behavioral tips included setting dates, making commitments, planning things to keep one's mind off smoking, having something to fidget with, having something to put in one's mouth, rewarding oneself when goals have been met, remembering that discomfort associated with withdrawal will subside within two weeks. One tip was found to be spiritual, [...] "Pray instead of puff". Since 1999 many of the NicA pamphlets have been updated and current versions may not contain the information analyzed.|$|E
5000|$|Recent {{research}} {{points at}} substantial {{differences in the}} cognitive styles of liberals and conservatives on psychological measures. For example, conservatives respond to threatening situations with more aggression than do liberals. Similarly, conservatives are more sensitive to threatening facial expressions. Jost and colleagues posed that political orientation is associated with psychological processes for managing fear and uncertainty A 2011 study by cognitive neuroscientist Ryota Kanai's group at University College London published in Current Biology, found a correlation between differences in political views and differences in brain structures in a <b>convenience</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> students from University College London. The researchers performed MRI scans on the brains of 90 volunteer students who had indicated their political orientation on a five-point scale ranging from [...] "very liberal" [...] to [...] "very conservative". Students who reported more [...] "conservative" [...] political views tended to have larger amygdalae, a structure in the temporal lobes that performs a primary role in the processing and memory of emotions. In addition, they found clusters in which gray matter volume {{was significantly associated with}} conservativism in the left insula and the right entorhinal cortex. There is evidence that conservatives are more sensitive to disgust and the insula is involved in the feeling of disgust [...] On the other hand, more 'liberal' students tended to have a larger volume of grey matter in the anterior cingulate cortex, a structure of the brain associated with monitoring uncertainty and handling conflicting information. It is consistent with previous research suggesting that individuals with a larger ACC have a higher capacity to tolerate uncertainty and conflicts, allowing them to accept more liberal viewsThe authors concluded that, [...] "Although our data do not determine whether these regions play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes, they converge with previous work to suggest a possible link between brain structure and psychological mechanisms that mediate political attitudes." [...] In an interview with LiveScience, Ryota Kanai said, [...] "It's very unlikely that actual political orientation is directly encoded in these brain regions", and that, [...] "more work is needed to determine how these brain structures mediate the formation of political attitude." [...] Kanai and colleagues added {{that it is necessary to}} conduct a longitudinal study to determine whether the changes in brain structure that we observed lead to changes in political behavior or whether political attitudes and behavior instead result in changes of brain structure.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the extent to}} which the human capacity for recognition helps to forecast political elections: We compared naive recognition-based election forecasts computed from <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> citizens' recognition of party names to (i) standard polling forecasts computed from representative <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> citizens' voting intentions, and to (ii) simple [...] -and typically very accurate [...] -wisdom-of-crowds-forecasts computed from the same <b>convenience</b> <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> citizens' aggregated hunches about election results. Results from four major German elections show that mere recognition of party names forecast the parties' electoral success fairly well. Recognition-based forecasts were most competitive with the other models when forecasting the smaller parties' success and for small sample sizes. However, wisdom-of-crowds-forecasts outperformed recognition-based forecasts in most cases. It seems that wisdom-of-crowds-forecasts are able to draw on the benefits of recognition while at the same time avoiding its downsides, such as lack of discrimination among very famous parties or recognition caused by factors unrelated to electoral success. Yet it seems that a simple extension of the recognition-based forecasts [...] -asking people what proportion of the population would recognize a party instead of whether they themselves recognize it [...] -is also able to eliminate these downsides. political elections, recognition, forecasting, heuristics, wisdom of crowds. ...|$|R
