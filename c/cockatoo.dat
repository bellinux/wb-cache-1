5|$|All {{species of}} <b>cockatoo</b> except the {{cockatiel}} {{are protected by}} the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restricts import and export of wild-caught parrots to special licensed purposes. Five <b>cockatoo</b> species (including all subspecies)—the Tanimbar corella (Cacatua goffiniana), red-vented <b>cockatoo</b> (Cacatua haematuropygia), Moluccan <b>cockatoo</b> (Cacatua moluccensis), yellow-crested <b>cockatoo</b> (Cacatua sulphurea) and palm <b>cockatoo</b> (Probosciger aterrimus)—are protected on the CITES Appendix I list. With {{the exception of the}} cockatiel, all remaining <b>cockatoo</b> species are protected on the CITES Appendix II list.|$|E
5|$|The ACT Government {{adopted the}} gang-gang <b>cockatoo</b> as its {{official}} faunal emblem on 27 February 1997. The short-lived budget airline Impulse Airlines featured a sulphur-crested <b>cockatoo</b> on its corporate livery (and aeroplanes). The palm <b>cockatoo,</b> {{which has a}} unique beak and face colouration, {{is used as a}} symbol by the World Parrot Trust.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-tailed black <b>cockatoo</b> is {{distinguished}} from other dark-plumaged birds by its yellow tail and ear markings, and its contact call. Parts of its range overlap with the ranges of two <b>cockatoo</b> species that have red tail banding, the red-tailed <b>cockatoo</b> and the glossy black <b>cockatoo.</b> Crow species may appear similar when seen flying at a distance; however, crows have shorter tails, a quicker wing beat, and different calls.|$|E
40|$|Several {{bird species}} are sexually monomorphic. In this case, {{molecular}} approach is an efficient method for their sex determination. The sexes of monomorphic birds {{can be determined}} by PCR amplification of the CHD genes. CHD genes are preserved within avian Z and W sex chromosomes. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine sex of 21 individuals quails, pigeons, hill myna, salmon-crested <b>cockatoos,</b> and yellow-crested <b>cockatoos</b> based on CHD genes using two pairs of primers: 2550 F- 2718 R and P 2 -P 8. Samples from Kampong chickens and ducks were used as controls. PCR products were screened by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. Results showed that 2550 F and 2718 R primers could be used to identify sex of Kampong chickens, quails, ducks, pigeons, hill myna, salmon-crested <b>cockatoos,</b> and yellow-crested <b>cockatoos.</b> Individuals showed double (ZW) and single (ZZ) bands were identified as females and males, respectively in Kampong chickens, quails, hill myna, salmon-crested <b>cockatoos</b> and yellow-crested <b>cockatoos.</b> Males and females in ducks and pigeons showed single band in different length of base pairs. P 2 and P 8 primers could be used to identify the sex of pigeons, hill myna, salmon-crested <b>cockatoos,</b> and yellow-crested <b>cockatoos.</b> All of those samples showed bouble (ZW) bands for females and single (ZZ) band for males...|$|R
5|$|Trained <b>cockatoos</b> are {{sometimes}} seen in bird shows in zoos. They are generally less motivated by food than other birds; some may more respond to petting or praise than food. <b>Cockatoos</b> {{can often be}} taught to wear a parrot harness, enabling their owners to take them outdoors. <b>Cockatoos</b> {{have been used in}} animal-assisted therapy, generally in nursing homes.|$|R
50|$|Glossy Black <b>Cockatoos,</b> Guenther's fourth novel, was {{published}} in late 2009. It is set in Australia and Asia, among the Hmong. The Colorado Authors' League judged Glossy Black <b>Cockatoos</b> the Best Genre Fiction of 2010.|$|R
5|$|Two 1970s police dramas {{featured}} protagonists with pet cockatoos. In the 1973 film Serpico, Al Pacino's character had a pet white <b>cockatoo</b> and {{the television}} show Baretta saw Robert Blake's character with Fred the Triton <b>cockatoo.</b> The popularity of the latter show saw a corresponding rise in popularity of cockatoos as pets in the late 1970s. Cockatoos have been used frequently in advertising; a <b>cockatoo</b> appeared in a 'cheeky' (and later toned down) 2008 advertising campaign for <b>Cockatoo</b> Ridge Wineries.|$|E
5|$|A white <b>cockatoo</b> and a sulphur-crested <b>cockatoo</b> {{were found}} to be {{infected}} with the protozoon Haemoproteus and another sulphur-crested <b>cockatoo</b> had the malaria parasite Plasmodium on analysis of faecal samples at Almuñecar ornithological garden in Granada in Spain. Like amazon parrots and macaws, cockatoos frequently develop cloacal papillomas. The relationship with malignancy is unknown, as is the cause, although a parrot papilloma virus has been isolated from an African grey parrot with the condition.|$|E
5|$|According to the IUCN and BirdLife International, seven {{species of}} <b>cockatoo</b> are {{considered}} to be vulnerable or worse and one is considered to be near threatened. Of these, two species—the red-vented <b>cockatoo</b> and the yellow-crested cockatoo—{{are considered to}} be critically endangered.|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{study of the}} haematological response to inflammation and/or traumatic injury was performed in two species of black <b>cockatoos,</b> namely white-tailed black <b>cockatoos</b> (WTBCs) (Calyptorhynchus funereus) and red-tailed black <b>cockatoos</b> (RTBCs) (C. magnificus). Evaluation of haematological data collected from 28 predominantly free-living birds was undertaken. The most consistent findings associated with inflammation or traumatic injury were mild to moderate anaemia, heterophilia and monocytosis. Changes in heterophil morphology were a relatively uncommon finding...|$|R
500|$|Red-tailed black <b>cockatoos</b> {{are around}} 60centimetres (24in) {{in length and}} sexually dimorphic. [...] The male's plumage is all black with a {{prominent}} black crest made up of elongated feathers from the forehead and crown. The bill is dark grey. The tail is also black with two lateral bright red panels. [...] Females are black with yellow-orange stripes in the tail and chest, and yellow grading to red spots on the cheeks and wings. [...] The bill is pale and horn-coloured. [...] The underparts are barred with fine yellow over a black base. [...] Male birds weigh between 670 and 920grams (1.5–2lb), while females weigh slightly less at 615–870grams (1.25–1.75lb). [...] In common with other <b>cockatoos</b> and parrots, red-tailed black <b>cockatoos</b> have zygodactyl feet, two toes facing forward and two backward, {{that allow them to}} grasp objects with one foot while standing on the other, for feeding and manipulation. [...] Black <b>cockatoos</b> are almost exclusively left-footed (along with nearly all other <b>cockatoos</b> and most parrots).|$|R

5|$|Cockatoos {{are popular}} birds in aviculture, but their needs are {{difficult}} to meet. The cockatiel is the easiest <b>cockatoo</b> species to maintain and {{is by far the}} most frequently kept in captivity. White cockatoos are more commonly found in captivity than black cockatoos. Illegal trade in wild-caught birds contributes to the decline of some <b>cockatoo</b> species in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos are {{recognisable}} by the showy crests and curved bills. Their plumage {{is generally}} less colourful {{than that of}} other parrots, being mainly white, grey or black and often with coloured features in the crest, cheeks or tail. On average they are larger than other parrots; however, the cockatiel, the smallest <b>cockatoo</b> species, is a small bird. The phylogenetic position of the cockatiel remains unresolved, other than that {{it is one of}} the earliest offshoots of the <b>cockatoo</b> lineage. The remaining species are in two main clades. The five large black coloured cockatoos of the genus Calyptorhynchus form one branch. The second and larger branch is formed by the genus Cacatua, comprising 11 species of white-plumaged cockatoos and four monotypic genera that branched off earlier; namely the pink and white Major Mitchell's <b>cockatoo,</b> the pink and grey galah, the mainly grey gang-gang <b>cockatoo</b> and the large black-plumaged palm <b>cockatoo.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{a captive}} yellow-tailed black <b>cockatoo</b> and two {{free-living}} tawny frogmouths (Podargus strigoides) suffering neurological symptoms {{were shown to}} be hosting the rat nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis. They were the first non-mammalian hosts discovered for the organism. A species of feather mite, Psittophagus calyptorhynchi, has also been isolated from the yellow-tailed black <b>cockatoo,</b> its only host to date.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in {{eucalyptus}} woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly {{parts of the}} country, these <b>cockatoos</b> are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters, generally Eucalyptus. Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations. Of the black <b>cockatoos,</b> the red-tailed is the most adaptable to aviculture, although black <b>cockatoos</b> are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cockatoos</b> are the {{distinctive}} family Cacatuidae, a major lineage {{of the order}} of parrots (Psittaciformes) and distributed throughout the Australasian region of the world. However, the evolutionary history of <b>cockatoos</b> is not well understood. We investigated the phylogeny of <b>cockatoos</b> based on three mitochondrial and three nuclear DNA genes obtained from 16 of 21 species of Cacatuidae. In addition, five novel mitochondrial genomes were used to estimate time of divergence and our estimates indicate Cacatuidae diverged from Psittacidae approximately 40. 7 million years ago (95...|$|R
5|$|The plumage of the {{cockatoos}} is less brightly coloured {{than that}} of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually on the crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's <b>cockatoo</b> are more broadly coloured in pink tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch of bare skin of the palm <b>cockatoo</b> is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of white <b>cockatoo,</b> notably the corellas and blue-eyed <b>cockatoo.</b> The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. The plumage of the female cockatiel is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang <b>cockatoo</b> and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus Calyptorhynchus, namely the red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being pink or red in the female galah and Major Mitchell's <b>cockatoo</b> and red-brown in some other female white <b>cockatoo</b> species. The males all have dark brown irises.|$|E
5|$|The vocalisations of {{cockatoos}} are {{loud and}} harsh. They serve {{a number of}} functions, including allowing individuals to recognize one another, alerting others of predators, indicating individual moods, maintaining the cohesion of a flock and as warnings when defending nests. The use of calls and number of specific calls varies by species; the Carnaby's black <b>cockatoo</b> has as many as 15 different calls, whereas others, such as Major Mitchell's <b>cockatoo,</b> have fewer. Some, like the gang-gang <b>cockatoo,</b> are comparatively quiet but do have softer growling calls when feeding. In addition to vocalisations, palm cockatoos communicate over large distances by drumming on a dead branch with a stick. <b>Cockatoo</b> species also make a characteristic hissing sound when threatened.|$|E
5|$|The {{wedge-tailed eagle}} (Aquila audax) kills Carnaby's black {{cockatoos}} sporadically, {{and is the}} only natural predator of the adult <b>cockatoo.</b> Carnaby's black <b>cockatoo</b> is occasionally parasitised by the bird louse species Franciscoloa funerei. In captivity, it is also susceptible to nematodes of the genus Ascaris if it is in a cage with open dirt flooring.|$|E
