The prior assumption made here is that firm entry and exit, along with variables such as firm size, cost of labour and gross value added determine the long-term demand for <b>capital</b> and <b>labour.</b> To do so, an economet-ric dynamic model expressing <b>capital</b> and <b>labour</b> <b>factors</b> {{as a function of}} both current and lagged values of the gross rate of entry is specified and estimated. Because of the high level of persistence of both <b>labour</b> and <b>capital</b> <b>factors,</b> a first extended system GMM estimator is performed, and the obtained estimated co-efficients are then used as initial values in the Least Squares Dummy Variable estimation corrected for the finite-sample bias (LSDVC) ...|$|R

40|$|Economic {{growth is}} seen {{here as the}} outcome of an entrepreneur-driven process of {{evolution}} {{in the context of}} an economy of competitive markets. In the course of this process the entrepreneurs implement <b>capital</b> and <b>labour</b> <b>factors,</b> one part of them committed to substitution and the other to complementarity with increasing returns. The theory demonstrates that the conditions of equilibrium of the different markets give rise to an attractor made up of steady states. The growth determinants for these states are employment, investment and technical productivity, with the profit share in income always being equal to 1 / 3. The comparison of what is learned with the empirical reality of the main developed economies demonstrates the interest of this view of growth.

40|$|In Spain, the {{companies}} that are mainly owned by the employees form {{a part of the}} Social Economy and offer an alternative business model, which is found in a conventional capitalist economy. The objective {{of this study is to}} establish whether there are significant differences in the performance of Employee Owned Firms (EOFs) and more conventionally structured businesses, non-Employee Owned Firms (non-EOFs), due to the inherent differences in the capital-ownership structure. The aim is to establish whether or not a corporate governance structure characterised by the employee participation for both the financial and the informational decision-making aspects can be advocated. The results show differences in favour of the conventional non-EOFs for various indicators measuring economic performance and confirm the different objectives of each business type; however, they provide evidence of significant differences in favour of the EOFs in terms of the efficient use of the <b>capital</b> and <b>labour</b> <b>factors</b> of production, according to the theoretical literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to re-investigate the {{relationship}} between electricity consumption and economic growth in Malaysia from 1972 : 1 to 2003 : 4. This study adopted the newly developed ECM-based F-test [Kanioura, A., Turner, P., 2005. Critical values for an F-test for cointegration in the multivariate model. Applied Economics 37 (3), 265 - 270] for cointegration to examine the presence of long run equilibrium relationship through the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model. The empirical evidence suggests that electricity consumption and economic growth are not cointegrated in Malaysia. However, the standard Granger's test and MWALD test suggest that electricity consumption and economic growth in Malaysia Granger causes each other. This finding provides policymakers with a better understanding of electricity consumption and allows them to formulate electricity consumption policy to support the economic development and to enhance the productivity of <b>capital,</b> <b>labour</b> and other <b>factors</b> of production for future economic growth in Malaysia. ...|$|R

For the last five years, the Central Java Province economic growth has raised, but it is considered low if it is compared to other Provinces in Java. Central Java Province has the lowest GDP per capita among the other provinces in Java Island. Whereas with many natural resources and human resources and the strategic areas between East Java and West Java, Central Java should be able to increase its economic growth and can be compete with other provinces particularly in Java. The aim of this research was to analize factors that influence economic growth. This research had been done in the regency/municipality’s economic growth in Central Java Province during five years period 2006 - 2010.

40|$|This paper aims to describe, {{identify}} underlying {{factors and}} seek explanations for South Africa's economic recovery since 1994, {{as evidenced by}} trends in growth and investment. Compared with an international peer group, the initial conditions for a dramatic growth recovery were inauspicious in 1994. Growth accounting methods are applied to distinguish the relative contributions of <b>capital,</b> <b>labour</b> and total <b>factor</b> productivity (TFP) to the growth revival, employing {{a broader range of}} measures for the contribution of labour at the aggregate level than used previously, and data of a more recent vintage. Sectoral developments since 1997 are also analysed using growth accounting. We find that TFP growth accounts for 50 % or more of South Africa's economic recovery, with the result mainly holding at the sectoral level too. Examination of empirical studies suggests that this result is primarily explained by openness to trade and capital flows, lower uncertainty and lower interest rates. Finally we consider policy implications. Copyright 2007 The author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Centre for the Study of African Economies. All rights reserved.

30|$|The {{analysis}} of policy simulations at the household level involves modeling sectoral <b>labour</b> and <b>capital</b> markets which allow a better assessment of general equilibrium effects on wages and investment income 8. The CGE the model includes 12 sectors producing 17 products (goods and services) {{based on the}} Input–output (IO) tables from Statistics Canada. Only 14 out of these 17 products are directly consumed by households. In each sector, the production of goods is represented by a Constant Elasticity of Transformation (CET) function. This reflects the rectangular aspect of the IO tables where each sector supplies more than one good depending on relative market prices. Also, we adopt a nested structure for the production technology. Sectoral gross output is a Leontief function of value-added and total intermediate consumption. Value-added is in turn represented by a Cobb-Douglass function of <b>capital</b> and aggregate <b>labour</b> <b>factor</b> which is represented by a Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) function of three skill levels: high-, medium-, and low-skilled workers according to the National Occupational Matrix (NOC) 9. Labour is assumed mobile between sectors, whereas capital is sector-specific and is only mobile through new investments.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to use the Solow growth model (Augmented Cobb-Douglas production function) as a basis to model the economic growth of Ghana during the period 1990 to 2010. Economic growth around the world has not been equal for a long time. Some economies grow faster than others. Economists have predicted that the slower growing economies will eventually converge to the faster growing economies at some point in time. In this study, we model the economic growth of Ghana using the Solow production model and applying growth differential equations. Starting from the estimates of the parameters from other studies, the growth model was simulated for the period 1990 to 2010. The recording and computation of the data was done using Matlab, SPSS and Excel. The computations were <b>Capital,</b> <b>Labour</b> force, Total <b>Factor</b> Productivity, and Total Production and the results from models were compared with the real GDP growth figures and variations noted. The estimations from the model were compared with the actual figures from the Ghana Statistical Service, World Bank and Bank of Ghana. The model provides a good approximation of the dynamics of the Ghanaian economy for the 1990 to 2010 periods, with respect to the dynamics of the real aggregate GDP growth and to the ratios of the main macroeconomic variables, like production per worker, capital-output ratio or capital per worker...|$|R

A time series quarterly data from the period of 1999 to 2008 was used. The effects of FDI inflows on human <b>capital,</b> <b>labour</b> force, absorptive capacity and physical capital were investigated. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was applied to estimate the data in the first step {{and in the second}} step productivity indicators were calculated. The results show that the FDI inflows and inputs used are negatively contributed to total factor productivity (TFP). Meanwhile, FDI plays a significant role in achieving economic growth through input driven as indicated by the contribution of the TFP. In this regard, a significant positive relationship between human <b>capital,</b> <b>labour</b> force and absorptive capacity which determines the spillover effect on Malaysian economic growth (GDP) was found and the physical capital has shown negative relationship...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{construction}} of optimal trajectories in the model which balances growth trends of investments in <b>capital</b> and <b>labour</b> efficiency. The model is constructed {{within the framework of}} classical approaches of the growth theory. It is based on three production factors: <b>capital,</b> educated <b>labour</b> and useful work. It is assumed that <b>capital</b> and educated <b>labour</b> are invested endogenously, and useful work is an exogenous flow. The level of GDP is described by an exponential production function of the Cobb-Douglas type. The utility function of the growth process is given by an integral consumption index discounted on the infinite horizon. The optimal control problem is posed to balance investments in <b>capital</b> and <b>labour</b> efficiency. The problem is solved on the basis of dynamic programming principles. Series of Hamiltonian systems are examined including analysis of steady states, properties of trajectories and their growth rates. A novelty of the solution consists in constructing nonlinear stabilizers based on the feedback principle which lead the system from any current position to an equilibrium steady state. Growth and decline trends of the model trajectories are studied for all components of the system and their proportions including: dynamics of GDP, consumption, <b>capital,</b> <b>labour</b> efficiency, investments in <b>capital</b> and <b>labour</b> efficiency...|$|R
