40|$|Accurate {{on-board}} capacity estimation is {{of critical}} importance in lithium-ion battery applications. Battery charging/discharging often occurs under a <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> <b>load,</b> and hence voltage vs. time measurements under this condition may be accessible in practice. This paper presents a data-driven diagnostic technique, Gaussian Process regression for In-situ Capacity Estimation (GP-ICE), which estimates battery capacity using voltage measurements over short periods of galvanostatic operation. Unlike previous works, GP-ICE does not rely on interpreting the voltage-time data as Incremental Capacity (IC) or Differential Voltage (DV) curves. This overcomes the need to differentiate the voltage-time data (a process which amplifies measurement noise), and the requirement that the range of voltage measurements encompasses the peaks in the IC/DV curves. GP-ICE is applied to two datasets, consisting of 8 and 20 cells respectively. In each case, within certain voltage ranges, as little as 10 seconds of galvanostatic operation enables capacity estimates with approximately 2 - 3 % RMSE.

Three model objective functions which are minimization of total supplied power, energy costs and maximization of profits are formulated. The conventional household load is modeled as a ZIP load that consists of constant power, constant current and constant impedance components. The imbalance of distribution system, constraints on nodal voltages and thermal loadings of lines and transformers are all taken into account. Utilizing the radial operation structure of distribution system, an extended iterative method is proposed to greatly reduce the dimensions of optimization variables and thus improve calculation speed. Impacts of the conventional household load model on the simulation results are also investigated. Case studies on three distribution systems with 2, 14, and 141 buses are performed and analyzed. It is found that the linear constrained convex quadratic programming model is applicable at each iteration, when the conventional household load is composed of constant power and constant impedance load.

Data from the hybrid test bench has been very useful in validating the PVToolbox and identifying those areas where it is accurate and those areas where it is not. Thus far, the accuracy of PVToolbox has been quite good. While the goal during development of PVToolbox was that it predict major energy flows (e. g., photovoltaic array output accepted by the system and electrical energy provided by the genset) with an error of 10 % or lower, in some recent tests errors of around 1 to 2 % —roughly {{the accuracy of the}} measuring devices—has been observed.

40|$|Nonlinear systems, such as {{switching}} DC-DC boost or buck converters, have rich dynamics. A simple one-dimensional discrete-time {{model is}} {{used to analyze the}} boost or buck converter in discontinuous conduction mode. Seven different control schemes (open-loop power stage, voltage mode control, current mode control, constant power load, <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> <b>load,</b> constant-on-time control, and boundary conduction mode) are analyzed systematically. The linearized dynamics is obtained simply by taking partial derivatives with respect to dynamic variables. In the discrete-time model, there is only a single pole and no zero. The single closed-loop pole is a linear combination of three terms: the open-loop pole, a term due to the control scheme, and a term due to the non-resistive load. Even with a single pole, the phase response of the discrete-time model can go beyond - 90 degrees as in the two-pole average models. In the boost converter with a resistive load under current mode control, adding the compensating ramp has no effect on the pole location. Increasing the ramp slope decreases the DC gain of control-to-output transfer function and increases the audio-susceptibility. Similar analysis is applied to the buck converter with a non-resistive load or variable switching frequency. The derived dynamics agrees closely with the exact switching model and the past research results.

This phenomenon is not well modeled by the commonly used static load models but is easily and accurately predicted by some induction machine models. This dissertation develops a method that models a group of induction machines and their connected mechanical loads at a bus by an equivalent induction machine and a mechanical load. Criteria are also developed for deciding which machines could be grouped together into equivalents with acceptable error levels;The equivalent machine draws active power from the source that is equal to the sum of the active power drawn by all the induction machines it replaces. Similarly, it draws reactive power and current equal to the sums of the reactive power and current drawn by the individual machines. It delivers mechanical power equal to the sum of the power delivered by the machines it replaces;The equations of the individual induction machines in the O-d-q axes are used in deriving the equivalent machine.

40|$|In this paper, a new backward/forward (b/f) {{methodology}} {{for the analysis}} of distribution systems with constant power loads is presented. In the proposed method, at each iteration, the loads are considered as constant impedances; in the backward sweep all the network variables (bus voltages and branch currents) are evaluated considering a scaling factor which is determined {{at the end of the}} backward phase. Indeed the forward sweep is eliminated and the node voltages calculation does not demand the sequentiality needed in the b/f methodology. The developed method, although deriving conceptually from the b/f methodology, presents only the backward phase in which all the network variables are evaluated considering a scaling factor. Moreover the load simulation as impedances is particularly important when the network shows PV nodes for which the voltage displacement and the reactive power are the unknowns. The condition of 90 ◦ displacement between the PV node voltage and the current injected by the apparatus for voltage regulation is not usually satisfied in networks solved by methods using <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> <b>load</b> models. The possibility to solve, at each iteration, a network made up of impedances allows to evaluate the reactance that must be inserted into the PV node in order to set the voltage at the prescribed value. In this way the value of this reactance is updated at each iteration and, at the end of the iterative process, whatever it is the displacement of the PV node voltage, the current circulating into the voltage regulating apparatus will be at 90 ◦ from it. In the paper, after a description of the PV nodes models reported in the b/f analysis literature, the new method is presented. The way in which the constant power loads are represented by means of a constant impedance model is also illustrated as well as the method for the evaluation of the unknown reactance to be installed at the PV nodes. The results of the executed applications show the efficiency of the model in terms of precision in the calculation of the reactive power required to sustain the voltage at the PV nodes...|$|E
40|$|Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) is a Custom Power Device {{based on}} a Voltage Source Converter (VSC) shunt {{connected}} to the grid. By injecting a controllable current, it can {{improve the quality of}} the load current, e. g. compensating harmonic currents or fluctuating currents. However, a STATCOM can also mitigate voltage dip by injecting current at the point of connection with the grid. This thesis focuses on the STATCOM for mitigating voltage dips. First, characteristics of the STATCOM for mitigating voltage dips are studied, such as the required shunt compensation current, injected active and reactive power for given voltage dip magnitude. This is done for different grid impedances and load characteristics (i. e. constant impedance load and <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> <b>load).</b> The results of this study show that the shunt compensation current, injected active and reactive power decrease as the impedance, which is the source impedance in parallel with the load impedance, increases. It also shows that reactive power is the main requirement for voltage dip compensation by STATCOM. All results are verified in MATLAB and simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC. Then, a Dual Vector Controller of the STATCOM, incorporating a vector voltage controller (outer loop) and a vector current controller (inner loop), is designed for mitigating the voltage dip and tested in simulation. The simulation models are implemented by the PSCAD/EMTDC. Three controller simulation models are reported in this thesis, which are Vector Voltage Controller with a simplified VSC, Dual Vector Controller with a simplified VSC and Dual Vector Controller with a real VSC. Three controllable current sources and three controllable voltage sources are used to represent the STATCOM and the VSC in the first two models, respectively. The Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) strategy is implemented in the third model. The vectors are implemented by using the Clarke and Park transformations to realize the controller system. In order to obtain the phase and frequency information of the grid voltage, Phase-Locked Loop is used in the controller system. The voltage dip can be mitigated in 5 ms by using the reactive power control in the vector voltage controller and the deadbeat gain in the vector current controller for the second simulation model. The third simulation model is verified both in 400 V system and 10 kV system.

40|$|Operational {{amplifiers}} {{are frequently}} {{used to make}} high-quality current sources {{in a variety of}} applications, such as industrial process control, scientific instrumentation, and medical equipment. Single Amplifier Current Sources, published in Analog Dialogue, Volume 1, Number 1, 1967, introduces several current source circuits that provide a <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> through floating <b>loads</b> or grounded loads. In industrial applications, such as pressure transmitters and gas detectors, these circuits are widely used to provide 4 -mA to 20 -mA or 0 -mA to 20 -mA currents. The improved Howland current source, shown in Figure 1, is very popular because it can drive a grounded load. The transistor, which allows relatively high currents, can be replaced by a MOSFET to achieve even higher currents. For low cost, low current applications, the transistor can be eliminated, as shown in Difference Amplifier Forms Heart of Precision Current Source, published in Analog Dialogue, Volume 43, Number 3, 2009. The accuracy of this current source is determined by the amplifier and the resistors. This article shows how to choose the external resistors to minimize errors...|$|R
40|$|Connecting green {{power sources}} to power grid are {{gradually}} becoming popular. Proper placement and sizing of these energy sources {{is important in}} order to obtain their maximum potential benefits. There have been studies to allocate the DG, in which loads are generally modeled as constant power or <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> types of <b>loads.</b> Since most of the distribution system loads are uncontrolled and dependent on the voltage and frequency of the system. Accordingly in this study a methodology has been presented that uses genetic algorithm to optimally place the DGs in terms of locations and sizes so as to minimize the per unit locational charges for active power at buses by incorporating different voltage dependent static load models. The presence of DG sources at distribution level has changed the characteristics of distribution network from passive to active. Nodal pricing and per unit locational charges often used in the pricing of short-term operation in transmission are good candidates to consider in distribution. Several simulation studies have been conducted on radial feeder as well as networked systems with single DG and multiple DG separately, subjected to no voltage violation at any of the buses...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{methodology}} to solve radial distribution networks, with <b>constant</b> <b>current</b> and/or impedance <b>loads</b> {{as well as}} shunt capacitor banks, is proposed. The techniques currently available to solve such systems are based either on iterative methods or on the bus impedance matrix. In both cases, the elaboration times are quite high since these are related, for iterative methods, to {{the overall number of}} iterations, and, for those methods based on the impedance matrix, to the inversion of the admittance matrix. The method developed here is the extension of a technique that is valid to solve networks made of impedances with one supply point. The methodology can also be applied in the solution, with the backward/forward methodology, of meshed systems having voltage-dependent loads and PV nodes. After having described the two cited networks’ analysis methodologies, the new methodology is developed and its implementation is described. The comparison of the computational performances, in terms of CPU times, between the iterative method, the method using the bus impedance matrix and the one developed in this paper provide evidence regarding the efficiency of the latter in strongly reducing the calculation times...|$|R
