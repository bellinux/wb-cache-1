40|$|Actuators {{for control}} and {{articulation}} aboard Mariner spacecraft have employed output shaft seals {{to maintain an}} internal gaseous atmosphere. On future missions, considerably greater expected lifetimes, temperature ranges, and radiation exposures {{have led to a}} need to determine the limitations of the present O-ring output shaft seal and to examine other candidate seals. Seals suited both to dynamic and static sealing were examined for potential use in three specific actuator applications and the following candidate seals were selected: (a) O-ring seal, (b) <b>chevron</b> <b>seal,</b> (c) bellows seal (linear actuator only), (d) magnetic fluid seal (rotary actuators only) and as a backup seal to any of the foregoing, (e) the labyrinth seal...|$|E
40|$|Molded high {{temperature}} plastic {{first and second}} stage rod seal elements were evaluated in seal assemblies to determine performance characteristics. These characteristics were compared {{with the performance of}} machined seal elements. The 6. 35 cm second stage <b>Chevron</b> <b>seal</b> assembly was tested using molded Chevrons fabricated from five molding materials. Impulse screening tests conducted over a range of 311 K to 478 K revealed thermal setting deficiencies in the aromatic polyimide molding materials. Seal elements fabricated from aromatic copolyester materials structurally failed during impulse cycle calibration. Endurance testing of 3. 85 million cycles at 450 K using MIL-H- 83283 fluid showed poorer seal performance with the unfilled aromatic polyimide material than had been attained with seals machined from Vespel SP- 21 material. The 6. 35 cm first stage step-cut compression loaded seal ring fabricated from copolyester injection molding material failed structurally during impulse cycle calibration. Molding of complex shape rod seals was shown to be a potentially controllable technique, but additional molding material property testing is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Six {{single stage}} {{reciprocating}} seal configurations {{to the requirements}} of the Stirling cycle engine were evaluated. The seals tested were: the Boeing Footseal, NASA <b>Chevron</b> polyimide <b>seal,</b> Bell seal, Quad seal, Tetraseal, and Dynabak seal. None of these seal configurations met the leakage goals of. 002 cc/sec at helium gas pressure of 1. 22 x 10 to the 7 th power PA, rod speed of 7. 19 m/sec peak, and seal environmental temperature of 408 K for 1500 hours. Most seals failed due to high temperatures. Catastrophic failures were observed for a minimum number of test runs characterized by extremely high leakage rates and large temperature rises. The Bell seal attained 63 hours of run time at significantly lowered test conditions...|$|R
