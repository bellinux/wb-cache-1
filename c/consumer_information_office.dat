40|$|Intense {{competition}} in the UK agri-food sector has made the use of <b>information</b> about <b>consumers</b> an important asset {{in the development of}} policies, strategies and decision making by businesses. However, in the agri-food sector, despite significant advances in the usefulness and ease of use of such information, SMEs are often seen to be disadvantaged for a variety of reasons, including inappropriate internal structures, capabilities and resources and, overall, an apparent lack of marketing orientation. The nature of SME marketing, and the disadvantages SMEs face, make it imperative to examine the use of <b>information</b> about <b>consumers</b> (i. e., <b>consumer</b> <b>information)</b> for marketing at the entrepreneurial and marketing interface (entrepreneurial marketing). <b>Consumer</b> <b>information</b> is conceptualised in this research as consisting of <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> for changing the user SME's knowledge and understanding of market issues (knowledge- enhancing utilisation); effecting policies and strategies (action-oriented instrumental utilisation); decision making {{for the sake of the}} appearance of information rather than the intrinsic qualities (action-symbolic utilisation) and the use of information with the intent of feeling good" (affective utilisation). The research then operationalises the entrepreneurial and marketing interface as entrepreneurial marketing to depict a functional focus of marketing in agri-food SMEs. However, research on the use of <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> to enhance firm performance at the entrepreneurial and marketing interface of SMEs is sparse. This research, therefore, examines <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> utilisation in agri-food SMEs by integrating three important research streams of SMEs, entrepreneurial marketing and consume~ information utilisation, and contributing to the extant literature by answering the following research questions: 1. What are the factors that influence <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> utilisation in SMEs? 2. How does <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> utilisation affect SME entrepreneurial marketing orientation? 3. How does <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> utilisation influence SME performance? Specifically, does entrepreneurial marketing orientation mediate the relationship between <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> utilisation and SME performance? To address- these research-questions, a sample of agri-food SMEs were [...] placed a -a unique pseudo-experimental context, where they were supplied with <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> over several months (specifically Tesco Supermarket loyalty card data from the dunnhumby database). Their usage of this information, and its antecedents and consequences, was then examined using a focus group and a questionnaire. Based upon empirical evidence, the results show that the antecedents of <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> utilisation (knowledge-enhancing utilisation, action-oriented instrumental utilisation and action-symbolic utilisation) include 1) its functional quality, 2) its technical quality, 3) the interaction between information provider and user, and 4) the market environment. However, a higher technical quality of <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> suppresses its use for the sake of appearance. Also, <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> utilisation was found to affect entrepreneurial marketing orientation of SMEs. The use of <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> for policy making, strategy and the sake of appearance enhance entrepreneurial marketing orientation. <b>Consumer</b> <b>information</b> for changing SME understanding of market issues did not have a direct relationship but appears to have a complex relationship in enhancing entrepreneurial marketing orientation of SMEs. The results also illustrate that, in the right circumstances <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> influence SME performance. The use of <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> for policy making and strategy directly enhance SME financial outcomes; and mediated by SME entrepreneurial marketing orientation to positively influence improvement in decision-making ability, and improved new products' creation and processes in SMEs. The use of <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> for changing the user SME's knowledge and understanding of market issues directly and indirectly through entrepreneurial marketing orientation enhances SME decision-making ability. Importantly, this research also shows that <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> utilisation enhances performance directly and indirectly through the mediating role of entrepreneurial marketing orientation. The research contributes to the marketing literature by providing a model for understanding <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> utilisation in SMEs, and by providing a series of validated parsimonious measures for <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> utilisation and entrepreneurial marketing orientation. So far the literature has primarily been focused with how large multi-national corporations use <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> but, as it becomes cheaper and more widely available, an understanding from the SME perspective is important. It highlights the important role of entrepreneurial -marketing orientation in realising SME performance outcomes. The research also provides guidance for policy makers and SME business facilitators in implementing <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> interventions for SMEs in the agri-food sector.

40|$|Markets for expert {{services}} {{are characterized by}} information asymmetries between experts and consumers. We analyze the effects of <b>consumer</b> <b>information,</b> where <b>consumers</b> suffer from either a minor or serious problem and only experts can infer the appropriate treatment. <b>Consumer</b> <b>information</b> is a noisy signal that is informative about a consumer's problem severity. In a laboratory experiment, we show that consumers are generally reluctant to accept expensive treatment recommendations, which is endorsed by good signals and fundamentally changed by bad signals. Experts condition their cheating on a consumer's risk of suffering from a serious problem if they can observe <b>consumer</b> <b>information.</b> Accordingly, experts and low-risk consumers benefit {{at the expense of}} more frequently cheated high-risk <b>consumers.</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>information</b> leads to more appropriate treatments being carried out and thus superior overall welfare. In contrast to our theoretical predictions, this effect does not depend on hiding <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> for experts...|$|R

The existence of a <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> overload phenomenon {{has been used by}} marketers and others to argue against regulations and legislation mandating additional <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> provision. The belief that a <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> overload phenomenon exists is based largely on misinterpretations of research findings. The present paper reviews the <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> overload research literature and concludes that existing research data support the contention that provision of more information, rather than producing overload, actually improves consumer decision making. Implications of the information overload research controversy for consumer policy makers are discussed. Copyright 1983 by The Policy Studies Organization. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{consumers}} {{are a source}} of innovation and value creation, and when information is increasingly produced and reproduced by consumers we need to reconsider the scope of information systems and their role in supporting companies to create value. The development of <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> systems in recent years can potentially help companies to create platforms that facilitate and support company-consumer collaborations that create value. This chapter discusses the theories, concepts and practices informing new modes of consumer co-creation and co-production in business and the role of <b>consumer</b> <b>information</b> systems in supporting those processes.
