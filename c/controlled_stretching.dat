METHODS: A test apparatus was constructed that allowed <b>controlled</b> <b>stretching</b> of capsulotomy edges following CTCC or RF diathermy capsulotomy. The lens contents were removed by phacoemulsification to permit the implantation of probes that exerted a test force on the capsulotomy edge and were moved in diametrically opposite directions using computer-controlled stepping motors. The magnitude of the force was measured during the capsule stretch, which allowed precise determination {{of the degree of}} capsular distention at the time of capsular rupture. Selected capsular edges were subsequently examined by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The capsulotomy edge produced by CTCC was significantly stronger (P <. 001) than that following RF. The mean (+/-SD) force to achieve capsule rupture was 0. 15 +/- 0. 06 N with CTCC compared with 0. 02 +/- 0. 01 N with RF.

40|$|Assemblies {{containing}} curved piezoceramic {{fiber composite}} actuators have been invented as means of stretching optical fibers by amounts {{that depend on}} applied drive voltages. Piezoceramic fiber composite actuators are conventionally manufactured as sheets or ribbons that are flat and flexible, but can be made curved to obtain load-carrying ability and displacement greater than those obtainable from the flat versions. In the primary embodiment of this invention, piezoceramic fibers are oriented parallel to the direction of longitudinal displacement of the actuators so that application of drive voltage causes the actuator to flatten, producing maximum motion. Actuator motion can be transmitted to the optical fiber by use of hinges and clamp blocks.

The ability to make electrical contact to single molecules creates opportunities to examine fun-damental processes governing electron flow on the smallest possible length scales. We report ex-periments in which we controllably stretch individual cobalt complexes having spin S = 1, while simultaneously measuring current flow through the molecule.

Our findings demonstrate a mechanism of spin control in single-molecule devices and establish that they can serve as model systems for making precision tests of correlated-electron theories. The electronic states of atoms and molecules depend on the symmetry imposed by their local environment.

40|$|Physiotherapy is an {{important}} part of post operative care for patients who have undergone orthopaedic surgery. Physiotherapy is also indicated for acute neurological diseases, osteoarthritis, vestibular disease, soft tissue injuries and conditioning. Passive physiotherapy is the <b>controlled</b> <b>stretching</b> of muscles, tendons and ligaments to gradually increase the amount of movement in the affected limb. The joint is flexed and extended for a few minutes. Physiotherapy is used to maintain joint motion and patient comfort. Active physical therapy should begin during the first post operative week by helping the patient to stand. This increases muscle strength and tone. Swim therapy is also a useful form of physiotherapy. It is important to ensure that any surgical repair is stable prior to physiotherapy and that the patient’s condition is not worsening with rehabilitation. REFERENCES: 1.

40|$|A liquid {{subjected}} to negative pressure is thermodynamically metastable. Confined within a small volume, negative pressure can build up until cavities form spontaneously. The critical negative pressure for cavitation in {{water has been}} theoretically predicted {{to be in the}} range of - 100 to - 200 MPa at room temperature, whereas values around - 30 MPa have been obtained by many experiments. The discrepancy has yet to be resolved. In this study we perform molecular dynamics simulations to study cavitation of water under volume <b>controlled</b> <b>stretching.</b> It is found that liquid water exhibits a nonlinear elastic compressibility (or stretchability) under hydrostatic tension and remains stable within the confined volume until spontaneous cavitation occurs at a critical strain. Subsequently, as the volume-controlled stretching continues, the cavity grows stably and the hydrostatic tension decreases continuously until the box volume is large enough for another transition to form a water droplet. A modified nucleation theory is proposed to predict the critical condition for cavitation. In particular, a strong dependence of the critical strain and stress for cavitation on the initial liquid volume is predicted by the modified nucleation theory, which may offer a possible explanation for the discrepancies in the values of the critical negative pressure obtained from experiments...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that sarcomere lengths (SLs) change in isometric fibres following activation and following stretch on the descending limb of the force-length relationship, {{because of an}} inherent instability. Although this assumption has never been tested directly, instability and SL non-uniformity {{have been associated with}} several mechanical properties, such as 'creep' and force enhancement. The aim {{of this study was to}} test directly the hypothesis that sarcomeres are unstable on the descending limb of the force-length relationship. We used single myofibrils, isolated from rabbit psoas, that were attached to glass needles that allowed for <b>controlled</b> <b>stretching</b> of myofibrils. Images of the sarcomere striation pattern were projected onto a linear photodiode array, which was scanned at 20 Hz to produce dark-light patterns corresponding to the A- and I-bands, respectively. Starting from a mean SL of 2. 55 +/- 0. 07 microm, stretches of 11. 2 +/- 1. 6 % of SL at a speed of 118. 9 +/- 5. 9 nm s(- 1) were applied to the activated myofibrils (pCa(2 +) = 4. 75). SLs along the myofibril were non-uniform before, during and after the stretch, but with few exceptions, they remained constant during the isometric period before stretch, and during the extended isometric period after stretch. Sarcomeres never lengthened to a point beyond thick and thin filament overlap. We conclude that sarcomeres are non-uniform but generally stable on the descending limb of the force-length relationship...|$|E
40|$|Microfabrication {{technology}} has enabled traditional {{chemical and biological}} research to be performed at the micrometer scale, but the control of particles suspended in fluids and the fluids themselves remain a significant challenge. This dissertation is aimed at developing simple and versatile control systems for fluids and small entities (e. g., particles and molecules) in fluids. Accordingly, three methods have been explored using electric and fluidic micromanipulation, {{as well as physical}} deposition. First, dielectrophoretic DNA positioning and elongation in a microchannel have been examined with modified surface chemistry and electrode conditions. Less hydrophilic surfaces provided more controllable stretching, presumably due to the decreased non-specific adsorption of DNA on these surfaces compared to their more hydrophilic counterparts. Smoothed electrode edges allowed more <b>controlled</b> <b>stretching,</b> and, moreover, thin electrodes (50 nm) provided dense electric field and gave ~ 90 % success rate of DNA stretching. Second, a microstencil method has been developed to pattern thermally and chemically sensitive materials. The microstencil has a bi-layer structure comprised of two polymeric films (i. e., parylene and SU 8). The parylene layer enables the microstencil to be mechanically peeled from hydrophilic substrates and SU 8 provides height to control the amount of material deposited. The amount is also controlled externally by performing multiple spin or dip coating processes. As an initial demonstration of the method, a wide range of chemically and thermally labile materials has been patterned: wax, cells, and proteins. Third, a continuous synthesis system for anisotropic microparticles with different shapes and sequences has been developed. The anisotropic particles are configured by exploiting a combination of geometrical confinement and microfluidics to pack particles into a narrow, terminal channel, and the packed particles are then bonded by thermal fusing. The width and length of the channels reproducibly specify the configuration of the anisotropic particles that will be produced. Complex sequences are obtained by coupling the sequential actuation of metering lines with the input flow of different particles. By using the process, linear and triangular homogeneous (A) and heterogeneous (A-B and A-B-A) particle chains have been synthesized...|$|E

40|$|A {{scheme for}} {{stabilizing}} {{the frequency of}} a microwave signal is proposed that exploits the operational characteristics of a coupled optoelectronic oscillator (COEO) and related optoelectronic equipment. An essential element in the scheme is a fiber mode-locked laser (MLL), the optical frequency of which is locked to an atomic transition. In this scheme, the optical frequency stability of the mode-locked laser is transferred {{to that of the}} microwave in the same device. Relative to prior schemes for using wideband optical frequency comb to stabilize microwave signals, this scheme is simpler and lends itself more readily to implementation in relatively compact, rugged equipment. The anticipated development of small, low-power, lightweight, highly stable microwave oscillators based on this scheme would afford great benefits in communication, navigation, metrology, and fundamental sciences. COEOs of various designs, at various stages of development, in some cases called by different names, have been described in a number of prior NASA Tech Briefs articles. A COEO is an optoelectronic apparatus that generates both short (picosecond) optical pulses and a steady microwave signal having an ultrahigh degree of spectral purity. The term "coupled optoelectronic" in the full name of such an apparatus signifies that its optical and electronic oscillations are coupled to each other in a single device. The present frequency-stabilization scheme is best described indirectly by describing the laboratory apparatus used to demonstrate it. The apparatus (see figure) includes a COEO that generates a comb-like optical spectrum, the various frequency components of which interfere, producing short optical pulses. This spectrum is centered at a nominal wavelength of 1, 560 nm. The spectrum separation of this comb is about 10 GHz, as determined primarily by the length of an optical loop and the bandpass filter in the microwave feedback loop. The optical loop serves as microwave resonator having a very high value of the resonance quality factor (Q). The optical frequency of MLL is then stabilized by locking it to an atomic transition as described below. The COEO contains a tunable 1 -nm band-pass optical filter and a piezoelectric-transducer (PZT) drum over which a stretch of fiber is wound. The 1 -nm-wide pass band of the filter provides coarse tuning to overlap the frequency comb with the atomic transition frequency. <b>Controlled</b> <b>stretching</b> of the fiber by means of the PZT drum can be used in conjunction with temperature control for locking the laser frequency. To reference to an atomic resonance at 780 nm in this demonstration setup, the optical output of the COEO at 1, 560 nm is fed through an erbium-doped-fiber amplifier (EDFA) to a frequency doubler {{in the form of a}} periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal. The frequency-doubled output is combined with the output of a separate frequency-stabilized diode laser at a photodetector. As described thus far, the two 780 -nm laser subsystems are nominally independent of each other and can, therefore, operate at different frequencies. Hence, at the photodetector, the two laser beams interfere, so that the output of the photodetector includes a beat note (a component at the difference between the two laser frequencies) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{state of}} the art {{components}} and subsystems {{to be used in the}} next generation of high speed optical transmission systems at 40 Gb/s. The thesis will provide guidelines for the design and implementation of 40 Gb/s systems, investigating topics that could limit transmission; chromatic dispersion, Polarization Mode Dispersion (PMD), Self Phase Modulation (SPM) and linear or non-linear crosstalk among others. Regarding chromatic dispersion, sufficient evidence is presented for the need in 40 Gb/s systems of either modulation formats that allow for higher tolerance than the traditional Non Return to Zero (NRZ) or use of Tunable chromatic Dispersion Compensators (TDC). Two single channel TDCs are experimentally evaluated. The first one, based on temperature changes in a chirped fiber Bragg grating, allows to reduce significantly chromatic dispersion induced penalty in a series of different standard Single Mode Fiber (SMF) spans ranging from 21. 5 km to 41 km. The second one, based on the <b>controlled</b> <b>stretching</b> of a nonlinearly chirped fiber Bragg grating, allows for unrepeatered transmission in standard-SMF spans ranging from 45 km to 103 km minimizing chromatic dispersion induced penalty. An optical duobinary transmitter (Tx) is implemented and its increased tolerance to chromatic dispersion is verified in a direct comparison to an NRZ transmitter. The limitations induced by PMD in 40 Gb/s system design are investigated. It is found that even for a standardized Short haul application (maximum distance of 40 km) the maximum PMD coefficient allowed in the transmission fiber, 0. 4 ps/sqrt(km), is below the values defined by actual standards, 0. 5 ps/sqrt(km). The most promising PMD compensation methods are presented and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. A PMD compensator based on a single fixed birefringent element is evaluated at 10 Gb/s and 40 Gb/s. It provides an improvement of at least a factor of two in the total PMD allowed in a link. However even when using the PMD compensator it is estimated that the maximum PMD coefficient in the fibers used in a five span link with 80 km per span is 0. 25 ps/sqrt(km), still below the maximum value allowed by standards. Return to Zero (RZ) and Carrier Suppressed RZ (CSRZ) modulation formats are found to provide a significant advantage in multi-span transmission compared to the traditional NRZ or the optical duobinary modulation formats. Using a 9 ps pulsed RZ Tx, transmission is achieved over a 400 km link consisting of 5 spans of 80 km standard-SMF with a Quality (Q) factor of 17. 7 dB, while for NRZ it is reduced to 15 dB. In another experimental verification over 40 km spans of standard-SMF, we could achieve transmission over 6 spans for the aforementioned RZ Tx with a Q of 18 dB, while for NRZ, transmission over 4 spans provided a Q of 17. 5 dB. A simple analytical approach separating the limitations induced by Optical Signal to Noise Ratio (OSNR) and SPM in multi-span transmission is presented and verified in the comparison of NRZ and RZ for transmission over standard-SMF with 40 km span length. The performance of NRZ, RZ, optical duobinary and CSRZ modulation formats in a 100 GHz channel spaced 40 Gb/s WDM system regarding linear crosstalk is investigated by means of simulations. It is found that RZ is seriously limited in 100 GHz channel spaced systems while NRZ and CSRZ provide enough tolerances to allow for practical system implementation. The optical duobinary format provides the best performance indicating the possibility of even narrower channel spaced systems using this modulation format. Three Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) experimental demonstrations are presented. The first one is a 100 GHz spaced 16 channel WDM system, using 40 Gb/s NRZ modulation over a 200 km link of standard-SMF. The second one is a 100 GHz spaced 32 channel 40 Gb/s WDM system, using CSRZ modulation over a 400 km link of standard-SMF and using Raman amplification. The third one is a 100 GHz spaced 6 channel WDM system, using NRZ as the modulation format, Se ??miconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOA) as the in-line amplifiers and in transmission over a 160 km link with span distances of 40 km standard-SMF, traditional target distance of metro WDM systems. Possible practical implementation of 40 Gb/s single channel and WDM systems are proposed and described following the methodology used by international standardization bodies...|$|E

Then the paper calculated and analyzed the factors of <b>stretching</b> <b>control</b> stress, number of post-tensioned steel. The results show that number of post-tensioned steel has a greater influence on the seismic behavior of the structure, and the <b>stretching</b> <b>control</b> stress has influence in a certain range. The results have some degree of guiding significance for the popularization of prefabricated frame...|$|R

Laplace's Law and Pascal's Law contribute to elaborate the static and dynamic working mechanisms behind the interaction between compression interventions and a biological body. However, {{there is still a}} lack of sufficient awareness on compression materials, and there is controversy regarding the best solution for clinical application of compression. This study integrates the views from physiology, pathophysiology, biomechanics, material science and textile engineering, to review and clarify physical-mechanical characteristics of compression materials, working mechanisms of textile-based compression interventions and their medical benefits in chronic venous insufficiency treatment. The aim is to enhance understanding of compression textiles applied in compression therapy, and to facilitate cooperation among multiple parties working in related supply chains, thus promoting textile-based compression interventions in chronic venous insufficiency treatment and growth of technical textiles applied in healthcare, medical and rehabilitation fields.
