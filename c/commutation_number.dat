40|$|As known, the {{cylindrical}} {{gravitational field}} (wave) have been canonically quantized and its wave function, as the quantum one, interpreted in probability terms. We show in this work, using quantum Zeno methods, that this probability may be substantially increased and even approach unity. For that we first show, in detailed manner, that the cylindrical gravitational field may {{be discussed in}} the <b>commutation</b> <b>number</b> representation. We also discuss this field in the transverse-traceless (TT) gauge and calculate the related trapped surface. Comment: 58 pages, 3 composite PS Figures (composed of 8 panels). Some corrections were added to the former version. Also clarifying sentences were added and some equations were derived and explaine...|$|E
40|$|A novel three {{dimensional}} space vector algorithm of multilevel converters for compensating harmonics and {{homopolar component}} in system with neutral is presented. This generalized method provides an online computation {{of the nearest}} switching vectors sequence to the reference vector and calculates the on-state durations of the respective switching state vectors without involving trigonometric functions, look-up tables or coordinate system transformations which increase the computational load corresponding to the modulation of multilevel converters. The low computational cost of the proposed method {{is always the same}} and it is independent of the number of levels of the converter. The conventional 2 D space vector algorithms are particular cases of the proposed generalized modulation algorithm. The algorithm provides the switching sequence that minimizes the total harmonic distortion and the <b>commutation</b> <b>number</b> of the semiconductor devices...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} measuring system for arc duration time of commutation spark, which is fabricated {{to evaluate a}} commutation action of D-C machine quantitavely. The superior features of the developed system are as follows 1) It is enables measuring of the duration time of commutation spark all of the commutator segment. 2) Accuracy {{of the system is}} within 0. 1 μs. with 0. 5 ms. commutator period (maximum rotation number). 3) It makes possible the long time automatic measurement. We have measured the duration time of commutation arc to JEC- 54 <b>commutation</b> spark <b>number.</b> Findings are: 1) The ratio of frequency distribution has two peaks to the duration time of commutation arc. 2) The maximum point of arc duration time in the ratio of frequency distribution increases according to the <b>commutation</b> spark <b>number.</b> 3) Arc duration time depends on brush materials and revoling speed with the same <b>commutation</b> spark <b>number</b> which is measured with eye. It suggests that evaluation of commutation spark with eye measurement is inaccurate. Hence, quantitave measurement is necessary...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{wide variety}} of models for {{concurrent}} programs has been proposed during the past decades, each one focusing on various aspects of computations: trace equivalence, causality between events, conflicts and schedules due to resource accesses, etc. More recently, models with a geometrical flavor have been introduced, based {{on the notion of}} cubical set. These models are very rich and expressive since they can represent <b>commutation</b> between any <b>number</b> of events, thus generalizing the principle of true concurrency. While they seem to be very promising – because they make possible the use of techniques from algebraic topology in order to study concurrent computations – they have not yet been precisely related to the previous models, and {{the purpose of this paper}} is to fill this gap. In particular, we describe an adjunction between Petri nets and cubical sets which extends the previously known adjunction between Petri nets and asynchronous transition systems by Nielsen and Winskel. 1...|$|R
