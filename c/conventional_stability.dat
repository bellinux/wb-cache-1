50|$|In 1972, US {{president}} Richard Nixon and Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev {{reached a}} compromise agreement to hold separate {{political and military}} negotiations. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) would deal with political issues, and Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions (MBFR) with military issues. The CSCE resulted in 1975 in 35 nations signing the concluding document: the Helsinki Final Act. Negotiations for MBFR were stalled by the USSR in 1979 because of NATO's decision to deploy new intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe. In 1986, Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev proposed {{in the context of}} MBFR negotiations to reduce ground and air forces, and to include conventional and nuclear weapons from the Atlantic to the Urals. This proposal was later that year formalized during a Warsaw Treaty meeting. NATO's North Atlantic Council of foreign ministers issued the Brussels Declaration on Conventional Arms Control, which called for two distinct sets of negotiations: one to build on the Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBM) results of the Stockholm Conference and the other to establish <b>conventional</b> <b>stability</b> in Europe through negotiations on conventional arms control from the Atlantic to the Urals (ATTU). In 1987, the Stockholm Document entered into force and provided for the first time for a negotiated right to conduct on-site inspections of military forces in the field.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{fundamental}} problems in flight dynamics is the formulation of aerodynamic forces and moments acting on an aircraft in arbitrary motion. Classically, <b>conventional</b> <b>stability</b> derivatives are used for the representation of aerodynamic loads in the aircraft equations of motion. However, for modern aircraft with highly nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamic characteristics undergoing maneuvers at high angle of attack and/or angular rates the <b>conventional</b> <b>stability</b> derivative model is no longer valid. Attempts to formulate aerodynamic model equations with unsteady terms are based on several different wind tunnel techniques: for example, captive, wind tunnel single degree-of-freedom, and wind tunnel free-flying techniques. One {{of the most common}} techniques is forced oscillation testing. However, the forced oscillation testing method does not address the systematic and systematic correlation errors from the test apparatus that cause inconsistencies in the measured oscillatory stability derivatives. The primary objective {{of this study is to}} identify the possible sources and magnitude of systematic error in representative dynamic test apparatuses. Sensitivities of the longitudinal stability derivatives to systematic errors are computed, using a high fidelity simulation of a forced oscillation test rig, and assessed using both Design of Experiments and Monte Carlo methods...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the collapse dynamics of observed low-mass starless cores, we revise the <b>conventional</b> <b>stability</b> condition of hydrostatic Bonnor-Ebert spheres to take internal motions into account. Because observed starless cores resemble Bonnor-Ebert density structures, the stability and dynamics of the starless cores are frequently analyzed by comparing to the <b>conventional</b> <b>stability</b> condition of a hydrostatic Bonnor-Ebert sphere. However, starless cores are not hydrostatic but have observed internal motions. In this study, we take gaseous spheres with a homologous internal velocity field and derive stability conditions of the spheres utilizing a virial analysis. We propose two limiting models of spontaneous gravitational collapse: the collapse of critical Bonnor-Ebert spheres and uniform density spheres. The collapse of these two limiting models are intended to provide the lower and the upper limits, respectively, of the infall speeds for a given density structure. The results of our study suggest that the stability condition sensitively depends on internal motions. A homologous inward motion with a transonic speed can reduce the critical size compared to the static Bonnor-Ebert sphere by more than a factor of two. As an application of the two limiting models of spontaneous gravitational collapse, we compare the density structures and infall speeds of the observed starless cores L 63, L 1544, L 1689 B, and L 694 - 2 to the two limiting models. L 1689 B and L 694 - 2 seem to have been perturbed to result in faster infall motions than for spontaneous gravitational collapse...|$|E
40|$|<b>Conventional</b> <b>stability</b> {{analysis}} in unsaturated silt and sand slopes {{often results in}} unrealistically low factors of safety. The {{purpose of the study}} was to increase the knowledge and the understanding of the unsaturated zone and its matrix suction in order to facilitate more elaborate stability analyses of silt and sand slopes. Great effort was made to prepare a method for determination of the shear strength in unsaturated silts and sands by the use of water retention curves. The method facilitates determination of the shear strength for practical purposes without the need to perform elaborate, time and cost-consuming laboratory tests. Measurements of matrix suction were performed in situ at different test sites. Grain size distributions and water retention curves were determined in the laboratory in order to identify any relationship between the composition of the soil and the corresponding matrix suction. Infiltration tests were made in the field and in the laboratory in order to study the effect of precipitation on matrix suction. Some of these tests were simulated numerically. The proposed method for determination of shear strength in unsaturated silts and sands taking matrix suction into account resulted in very good agreement with known laboratory test results. Based on the results from the field and laboratory tests, recommendations have been prepared for how to use the proposed method in engineering practice and for how matrix suction can be taken into account in stability analyses in unsaturated silts and sands. Stability analysis taking matrix suction was found to give results which were more in agreement with existing geometry and observed sliding activity compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>stability</b> analysis...|$|E

Finally, a factor of safety (FS) for the slope will be computed. The FS is the ratio of the shear strength of the soil against the shear stress required for equilibrium.|$|E
