50|$|Stainless steel, {{aluminium}} alloys, iron alloys, chrome plates, tin, {{gold and}} tantalum were tested {{to see how}} RFNA affected the <b>corrosion</b> <b>rates</b> of each. Experiments were performed using 16% and 6.5% RFNA samples and the different substances listed above. Many different stainless steels showed resistance to corrosion.

25|$|The Mitsubishi-Shindoh Co., Ltd., has {{developed}} a proprietary copper-zinc brass alloy, called UR30, specifically designed for aquaculture operations. The alloy, which is composed of 64% copper, 35.1% zinc, 0.6% tin, and 0.3% nickel, resists mechanical abrasion when formed into wires and fabricated into chain link, woven, or other types of flexible mesh. Corrosion rates depend on the depth of submersion and seawater conditions. The average reported <b>corrosion</b> <b>rate</b> reported for the alloy is < 5 μm/yr based on two- and five-year exposure trials in seawater.|$|E
25|$|Certain conditions, such as low {{concentrations}} of oxygen or high {{concentrations of}} species such as chloride which complete as anions, can interfere with a given alloy's ability to re-form a passivating film. In the worst case, {{almost all of the}} surface will remain protected, but tiny local fluctuations will degrade the oxide film in a few critical points. Corrosion at these points will be greatly amplified, and can cause corrosion pits of several types, depending upon conditions. While the corrosion pits only nucleate under fairly extreme circumstances, they can continue to grow even when conditions return to normal, since the interior of a pit is naturally deprived of oxygen and locally the pH decreases to very low values and the <b>corrosion</b> <b>rate</b> increases due to an autocatalytic process. In extreme cases, the sharp tips of extremely long and narrow corrosion pits can cause stress concentration to the point that otherwise tough alloys can shatter; a thin film pierced by an invisibly small hole can hide a thumb sized pit from view. These problems are especially dangerous because they are difficult to detect before a part or structure fails. Pitting remains among the most common and damaging forms of corrosion in passivated alloys, but it can be prevented by control of the alloy's environment.|$|E

A systematic error of approximately 100 % was evident in a comparison of 2500 HA <b>corrosion</b> <b>rates</b> against comparable data obtained by using linear polarisation (LP) in conjunction with assumed Tafel slopes. Conversely, a correlation of recalculated LP data by using the HA determined Tafel slopes yielded comparable <b>corrosion</b> <b>rates</b> by HA and LP. This outcome suggests that HA is capable of providing a higher degree of accuracy in studies of carbon dioxide corrosion, as compared to LP, due to the former technique's ability to determine simultaneously the Tafel slopes and <b>corrosion</b> <b>rates.</b> © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

2500|$|Although {{glass as}} a {{material}} {{is known for}} its chemical stability resistance to natural deterioration, impurities and variations in glass composition can cause considerable chemical instability that may further destructive processes (Vogel et al. 2007, 7). [...] Glass is also susceptible to atmospheric pollution, and high levels of humidity or moisture over long periods of time, both of which can speed up the <b>corrosion</b> <b>rate</b> of chemically unstable glass. [...] Over time, corrosion, marked by pitting or pocking of the glass, can deepen and spread until the surface layer itself breaks apart, uncovering the vulnerable, damaged core, until it becomes opaque (Rauch 2004, 3). [...] This opacification occurs as water seeps through the subsequent cracks, causing the formation of opaque syngenite and gypsum crystals that block light from filtering through the previously translucent glass (Rauch 2004, 3). [...] As these crystals continue to grow, they pose an even greater danger to the glass, eventually breaking through the surface and dislodging the delicate paint layer, or even causing cracks (Rauch 2004, 4). [...] Glass plates can also darken or cloud {{as the result of the}} oxidisation of certain metals, such as manganese, which was a common addition to late medieval glass (Rauch 2004, 4).|$|E
