40|$|Abstract. Seizures are {{a common}} problem in neonates. Differential diagnoses include infection, trauma, hypoxia and {{congenital}} metabolic disorders. Among these, congenital metabolic disorder is less familiar to general pediatricians. We report two patients with nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), a rare and lethal <b>congenital</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>disease.</b> Transient hyperammonemia and transient hypouricemia, uncommon features found in NKH, were detected in one patient. High doses of sodium benzoate and dextromethorphan failed to modify the clinical course. Neuropathology denoted characteristic diffuse vacuolization and changes in reactive and gliotic astrocytes. The clinical course, biochemical findings, diagnostic approaches and diagnostic tests are discussed in detail. Recent modalities of treatment are reviewed.

40|$|Background Phenyl ketonuria (PKU) is a <b>congenital</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>disease.</b> Irreversible {{brain damage}} {{is the result}} of phenyl alanin accumulation, so its amount should be {{restricted}} in patients diet. In their diet, trace elements such as hem Iron, folic acid, vitamin B 12 and, etc are also limited, and could represent anemia. In this study, the frequency of anemia in PKU patients in Yazd was investigated and compare with non-affected individuals. Materials and MethodsIn this case-control study, all the PKU patients of Yazd who were under diet at least for 6 months were selected. The controls were selected from non PKU population and matched with cases according to age, gender and socioeconomic level. Hematologic factors were measured in both groups and analyzed using SPSS software using T-Test. Results This study consisted of 18 patients aged between 1 to 18 years old. Full blood count and blood indices did not show significant difference (p> 0. 05), except MCHC (p 0. 05).

Foi realizado exame antropométrico, sempre pelo mesmo observador, que incluiu a medida do peso e da altura, sendo posteriormente calculados os escores z de P/l, A/I e P/A. Para a análise da associação entre os indicadores antropométricos e as variáveis de estudo empregaram-se os testes de Mann-Whitney e Kruskal-Wallis com um 0 = 0. 05. Encontrou-se aproximadamente 50 % dos casos do sexo masculino, com um pouco mais da metade da raça branca e, a maioria com mais de cinco anos de idade, de renda salarial proporcionalmente alta e escolaridade materna baixa. As glomerulopatias e as malformações do trato urinário foram as etiologias mais freqüentes. A CAPD predominou como forma de tratamento e o transplante renal foi realizado em 11 crianças. O c 1 earence de creatinina com média de 10, 60 m 1 /min/ 1, 73 m 2 demonstra a gravidade dos casos. Observou-se que 41, 9 % das crianças tinham escore z de A/I abaixo de menos três e 60, 5 % abaixo de menos dois. O comprometimento do indicador P/l foi menos importante (20, 5 % abaixo de menos três e 43, 6 % abaixo de menos dois). Quanto ao indicador P/A apenas um paciente encontrava-se com índice {{inferior}} a menos de dois. Procurou-se avaliar a associação entre os. escores z de A/I, P/l e P/A e as variáveis estudadas. Com relação ao indicador A/I, a variável que apresentou ser estatisticamente significativa, foi a etiologia da IRC, além do sexo. Destas, a cistinose, doença metabólica congênita, apresentou maior comprometimento da estatura, quando comparada às outras (p= 0, 03), provavelmente por estar presente desde o nascimento, levando a um diagnóstico etiológico mais precoce (p= 0, 03), assim como, pelo fato destas crianças terem entrado em IRC mais precocemente (p= 0, 004). Também foi encontrado maior dificuldade no controle da acidose metabólica e do metabolismo de cálcio e fósforo nestes pacientes. O sexo masculino também mostrou maior comprometimento do crescimento não associado a nenhuma etiologia. Em relação ao indicador P/I, nenhuma variável apresentou diferença estatisticamente significativa. Para o P/A, as crianças até cinco anos tiveram uma relação P/A melhor, enquanto os maiores níveis de hemoglobina tiveram um indicador mais baixo;;Abstract:The pourpose of {{this work}} is characterize and evaluate the nutritional status of 43 patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) followed at the Pediatric Nefrology Clinic (HC_UNICAMP). Sex, race, age, family income, mother's education, were studied, as well as, etyological dyagnosis, age {{at the onset of}} the disease and CRI, creatinine c 1 earence, haemoglobin, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, pH and bicarbonate and, the indicators distribuition height/age (H/A), weight/age (W/A) and weight/height (W/H). An anthropometric examination was realized by the same observer, including the measurement of the weight and height and than the z-score was calculated for all indicators above. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used with a= 0, 05 to analyse the relationship between the anthropometric indicators and the variances of this study. Most of the children were more than 5 years old, almost 50 % were male and a little bit more than a half were white, with a fami 1 y income proporcionally high and mother's education low. The glomerulopathy and the urinary tract malformation were the most frequent etiology. CAPD was the most realized treatment, folowed by renal transplantation done in 11 children. The creatinine c 1 earence with average equal to 10, 60 mVmin/l, 73 m 2 shows the severity ofthe cases. Analysing the z-score of the indicator H/ A there were found 41, 9 % of the patients under minus three and 60, 5 % under minus two. The indicator W/A were less compromised (20, 5 % under minus three and 43, 6 % under minus two). Regarding the indicator W/H, only one child was under minus two. A relationship between the z-scores of the indicators H/A, W/A and W/H and the variances studied were analysed. Only the etiology and the sex were statistically different for the indicator H/A. Concerning to etiology, the cystinose, <b>congenital</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>disease,</b> were associated with a higher growth retardation (p= 0, 03), probably because it starts since birth, with a sooner etiological diagnosis (p= 0, 03), and also because those children start the CRI early in life (p= 0, 004). Metabolic acidosis and calcium and phosphorus metabolism were harder to control for those patients. Males had also a worse growth retardation. Any variance was statistically different for the indicator W/A, and for W/H the youngest children had better z-scores in contrast of the highest levels of haemoglobi...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMitochondrial {{disorders}} {{have the}} highest incidence among <b>congenital</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases,</b> and are thought to occur {{at a rate of}} 1 in 5000 births. About 25 % of the diseases diagnosed as mitochondrial disorders in the field of pediatrics have mitochondrial DNA abnormalities, while the rest occur due to defects in genes encoded in the nucleus. The most important function of the mitochondria is biosynthesis of ATP. Mitochondrial disorders are nearly synonymous with mitochondrial respiratory chain disorder, as respiratory chain complexes serve a central role in ATP biosynthesis. By next-generation sequencing of the exome, we analyzed 104 patients with mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders. The results of analysis to date were 18 patients with novel variants in genes previously reported to be disease-causing, and 27 patients with mutations in genes suggested to be associated in some way with mitochondria, and it is likely that they are new disease-causing genes in mitochondrial disorders.

50|$|Little {{is known}} about the wild {{reproductive}} behavior of crested geckos, but in captivity they breed readily, with the female laying two eggs which hatch 60-150 days after they are laid. Eggs are generally laid at four week intervals as long as the fat and calcium reserves of the female are still at healthy levels. Crested geckos have two small sacs for calcium on the roof of their mouths. If an egg laying female does not have enough calcium her sac will be depleted, and she can suffer from calcium deficiency. This can lead to a calcium crash where the female appears shaky or wobbly, lethargic, has a lack of appetite, and can even result in death. Eggs laid by a female whose calcium reserves are low occasionally exhibit signs of <b>congenital</b> <b>metabolic</b> bone <b>disease,</b> such as an underbite and/or a kinked or wavy tail.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Mitochondrial {{disorders}} {{have the}} highest incidence among <b>congenital</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>diseases,</b> and are thought to occur {{at a rate of}} 1 in 5000 births. About 25 % of the diseases diagnosed as mitochondrial disorders in the field of pediatrics have mitochondrial DNA abnormalities. Friedreich’s ataxia is caused by a defect (mutation) in a gene labeled FXN. The disorder is recessive, meaning it occurs only in someone who inherits two defective copies of the gene, one from each parent. The FXN gene codes for production of a protein called "frataxin". Without a normal level of frataxin, certain cells in the body (especially peripheral nerve, spinal cord, brain and heart muscle cells) cannot effectively produce energy and have been hypothesized to have a buildup of toxic byproducts leading to what is called “oxidative stress. ”Aims of the study: To indicate the importance of early diagnose and possibilities of the treatment of patients with mitochondrial disease. Material and methods: A diagnosis of Friedreich's ataxia requires a careful clinical examination, which includes a medical history and a thorough physical exam, in particular looking for balance difficulty, loss of proprioception (joint sensation), absence of reflexes, and signs of neurological problems. Genetic testing now provides a conclusive diagnosis. They are excellent opportunity to extend the life of patients with Friedreich 's ataxia and other mitochondrial disease. Conclusion: Advances in understanding the genetics of mitochondrial disease are leading to breakthroughs in treatment. Genetic testing is essential for proper clinical diagnosis, and can aid in prenatal diagnosis and determining a person’s carrier status. Genetic counselors can help explain how mitochondrial disease is inherited. This is very important for patients with Friedreich 's ataxia and other mitochondrial disease, and that will continue their lifes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Spontaneous iron {{accumulation}} in hepatocytes {{was observed}} in a 7 -week-old female Han Wistar GALAS rat. Very fine yellowish brown pigments, which showed a positive reaction with Berlin Blue stain, were apparent in the cytoplasm close to the bile canaliculi, with a diminishing periportal-to-centrilobular gradient. There were also differences in distribution between and within lobes. Transmission electron microscopy revealed cytosolic ferritin and pericanalicular siderosomes in hepatocytes. No degeneration or necrotic changes were observed, and non-hepatocyte cells did not demonstrate any obvious accumulation of iron. There were no abnormalities in the animal other than this finding in the liver. (J Toxicol Pathol 2009; 22 : 199 – 203) Key words: iron overload, iron accumulation, hepatocyte, spontaneous, rats Iron can accumulate in the liver {{under a variety of}} conditions, including systemic iron-loading, some types of hepatitis and alcoholic liver disease 1. Hemochromatosis is a well-known <b>congenital</b> <b>metabolic</b> disorder <b>disease</b> in which iron accumulates predominantly in liver parenchymal cells in the early phase and subsequently in liver Kupffer cells, the pancreas, the heart, endocrine glands and so on 2. It is clear that the fundamental abnormality existing in this condition is excessive absorption of iron in the duodenum. In a toxicological study, we recently encountered a female rat at 7 weeks of age with iron overloading in the liver. Because this animal was a control fed a normal diet, the abnormality was presumed to be spontaneous. There has only been one previous article documenting spontaneous iron loading in rats 3.
