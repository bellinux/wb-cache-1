5|$|AFIS {{made several}} {{attempts}} to <b>call</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. It {{received a call}} from a resident close to Torghatten which said they had heard aircraft noise followed by a crash. Brønnøysund Fire Department and an ambulance helicopter with a doctor was dispatched to Torghatten. The rescue work was made difficult by low clouds, small fires and explosions. The terrain was difficult and the lack of daylight made assisting the situation difficult. A helicopter with medical personnel and the airport direct arrived at 21:25, while a meeting place for the next of kin was established at the airport. At 23:30 the police stated that there was no hope of finding survivors and the scene changed from a search to an investigation scene. Due to the fog {{it was not possible to}} verify that all people had been killed until the next day. Seventy-five soldiers from the Home Guard participated in the salvage.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{capital was}} {{originally}} located in Philadelphia, {{beginning with the}} First and Second Continental Congress, followed by the Congress of the Confederation upon gaining independence. In June 1783, a mob of angry soldiers converged upon Independence Hall to demand payment for their service during the American Revolutionary War. Congress requested that John Dickinson, the governor of Pennsylvania, <b>call</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> militia to defend Congress from attacks by the protesters. In {{what became known as}} the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from Philadelphia.

25|$|The {{means by}} which the Anglo-Saxons marshaled forces to defend against marauders also left them {{vulnerable}} to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could <b>call</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> national militia to defend the kingdom but, {{in the case of the}} Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.|$|E
500|$|Make-up artist Greg Cannom {{was pleased}} to be {{involved}} in Hannibal as it offered him the chance to produce [...] "incredible and original make-ups". For Mason Verger, the make-up team would initially produce 20 different heads which looked like zombies and did not reflect the vision Scott had of the character; Scott wanted Verger to look real with hideous scarring, and not something from the [...] "House of Wax". Scott himself would actually <b>call</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> help of expert doctors {{in an effort to get}} the look of the character as realistic as possible. Scott showed the make-up team pictures of foetal things, which he thought touching; he wanted to make Mason Verger more touching than monstrous, as he thought of Verger as being someone who hadn’t lost his sense of humour...almost sympathetic. Oldman would spend six hours a day in make-up to prepare for the role.|$|E

[...] While Ed Easton Jr. from 92.3 Now FM drew comparisons to Diddy's earlier video for his 1997 hit single [...] "Been Around the World", thus awarding the video six out of ten. However Easton was annoyed with the number of videos being released and said that fans were waiting for the actual album to be released.|$|E

500|$|In June 1974, Lennon and Pang {{returned}} {{to live in}} New York City. Lennon stopped drinking and concentrated on recording. As Lennon had previously had cats in Liverpool—while living at his aunt Mimi's house—he and Pang adopted two cats which they named Major and Minor. In the early summer, while Lennon was working on his Walls and Bridges album, the couple moved into a penthouse apartment at 434 East 52nd Street, where Lennon and Pang claim to have seen a UFO on August 23, 1974, from their terrace, which had {{a panoramic view of}} east New York. To gain access to the deck Lennon and Pang had to climb out of their kitchen window. On the night in question, a naked Lennon excitedly called Pang to join him on the deck outside and they both watched a circular object silently floating less than 100 feet away. Lennon called Bob Gruen—Lennon's [...] "official" [...] photographer—and told him what had happened. Gruen suggested Lennon should call the police, but Lennon laughed it off, saying, [...] "I’m not going to <b>call</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> newspaper and say, 'This is John Lennon and I saw a flying saucer last night'". Gruen called the local police precinct which confirmed that three other people had reported a sighting, and the Daily News said that five people had reported a sighting in the same area of New York where Lennon and Pang lived.|$|E

2500|$|One {{suggested}} {{example of}} a Kido Butai transmission is the November 30, 1941, COMSUM14 report in which Rochefort mentioned a [...] "tactical" [...] circuit heard calling [...] "marus". (a term often used for commercial vessels or non-combat units). Further, the perspective of U.S. naval intelligence at the time was, [...] "...The significance of the term, 'tactical circuit' is that the vessel itself, that is Akagi, was using its own radio to <b>call</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> other vessels directly rather than work them through shore stations via the broadcast method which was the common practice in Japanese communications. The working of the Akagi with the Marus, indicated that she was making arrangements for fuel or some administrative function, since a carrier would rarely address a maru." ...|$|E

2500|$|Searle {{responds}} {{that such}} a mind is, at best, a simulation, and writes: [...] "No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched."

[...] "When we <b>call</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pocket calculator function on a desktop computer, the image of a pocket calculator appears on the screen. We don't complain that 'it isn't really a calculator', because the physical attributes of the device do not matter." [...] The question is, is the human mind like the pocket calculator, essentially composed of information? Or is the mind like the rainstorm, something other than a computer, and not realizable in full by a computer simulation? (The issue of simulation is also discussed in the article synthetic intelligence.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Combat units also lacked cohesion, {{due to the}} {{reluctance}} of the Johnson administration to <b>call</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> reserves, and a rotation policy that did not secure the best trained personnel on a consistent, long-term basis for Vietnam. The result in many US units was an endless supply of less seasoned [...] "green" [...] draftees or short-training officers, [...] "rotated" [...] in the theater for one year. Such policies were a drag on overall stability and cohesion, and caused the loss of hard-won combat knowledge in-country. Troop rotation policies also hindered continuity in pacification. Adviser postings to the ARVN's regular or local forces for example, were {{not considered to be}} a desirable career tracks, and a one-year or six-month tour of duty left scant time to build the intimate knowledge of an area, its politics, and its people necessary to counter the clandestine Communist infrastructure. American advisers might just begin to see results on the ground when they were rotated out.|$|E

[...] In 1969, organizers of the Merrie Monarch Festival were about to cancel their parade because of heavy rain, but Luahine said the rain would stop for two hours starting at 1 p.m. [...] Even organizer Dorothy Thompson recalled: [...] "She told me the parade had to start on time, at 1 o'clock, because the rain would stop for only two hours.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 6th century, during the wars instigated by Fredegund and Brunhilda, the Merovingian monarchs {{introduced}} a new element into their militaries: the local levy. A levy consisted of all the able-bodied men of a district who were required to report for military service when called upon, similar to conscription. The local levy applied only to a city and its environs. Initially only in certain cities in western Gaul, in Neustria and Aquitaine, did the kings possess the right or power to <b>call</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> levy. The commanders of the local levies were always different from the commanders of the urban garrisons. Often the former were commanded by the counts of the districts. A much rarer occurrence was the general levy, which applied to the entire kingdom and included peasants ( [...] and [...] ). General levies could also be made within the still-pagan trans-Rhenish stem duchies on the orders of a monarch. The Saxons, Alemanni and Thuringii all had {{the institution of the}} levy and the Frankish monarchs could depend upon their levies until the mid-7th century, when the stem dukes began to sever their ties to the monarchy. Radulf of Thuringia called up the levy for a war against Sigebert III in 640.|$|E
