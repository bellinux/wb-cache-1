5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{has been}} threatened by erosion for decades. In the 1930s, {{as a response}} to the erosion, a breakwater was constructed to protect the boat landing area. In 1996, the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Trust for Historic Preservation assisted the task of obtaining funding for a $4.5 million erosion-control project. The funds were approved in 1998 with the help of Connecticut Senators, Joseph Lieberman and <b>Christopher</b> <b>Dodd</b> and New Haven's Congressional Representative Rosa DeLauro. In 2001, the construction of a stone wall and creation of a buffer zone was completed. The second phase of the project calls for protective revetment on the south side of the island.|$|E
5|$|From 1977 to 1983, Ford was {{a member}} of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. He first sought the post of Democratic whip in 1988, but lost to California's Alan Cranston, who had held the post since 1977. Ford got a late start in the race, and a New York Times writer opined that he {{overestimated}} his chances of unseating Cranston. Immediately after conceding his loss, he announced he would be a candidate for the position in the next election in 1990. He again faced Cranston in the election, but Cranston withdrew from the race due to a battle with prostate cancer. Ford maintained that he had enough commitments of support in the Democratic caucus to have won without Cranston's withdrawal. When majority leader George J. Mitchell retired from the Senate in 1994, Ford showed some interest in the Democratic floor leader post. Ultimately, he decided against it, choosing to focus instead on Kentucky issues. He supported <b>Christopher</b> <b>Dodd</b> for majority leader.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we examine}} three {{different}} versions of "categorification" of the affine Hecke algebra and its periodic module: the first is by equivariant coherent sheaves on the Grothendieck resolution (and related objects), the second is by certain classes on bimodules over polynomial rings, called Soergel bimodules, {{and the third is}} by certain categories of constructible sheaves on the affine flag manifold (for the Langlands dual group). We prove results relating all three of these categorifications, and use them to deduce nontrivial equivalences of categories. In addition, our main theorem allows us to deduce the existence of a strict braid group action on all of the categories involved; which strengthens a theorem of Bezrukavnikov-Riche. by <b>Christopher</b> Stephen <b>Dodd.</b> Thesis (Ph.
