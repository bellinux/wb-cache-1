50|$|<b>Cb</b> <b>is</b> a {{modification}} factor {{used in the}} equation for nominal flexural strength when determining lateral-torsional buckling. The reason for this factor is to allow for non-uniform moment diagrams when the ends of a beam segment are braced. The conservative value for <b>Cb</b> can <b>be</b> taken as 1, regardless of beam configuration or loading, {{but in some cases}} it may <b>be</b> excessively conservative. <b>Cb</b> <b>is</b> always equal to or greater than 1, never less. For cantilevers or overhangs where the free end <b>is</b> unbraced, <b>Cb</b> <b>is</b> equal to 1. Tables of values of Cb for simply supported beams exist.|$|R

25|$|<b>CBS</b> <b>is</b> a multidomain enzyme {{composed}} of an N-terminal enzymatic domain and two CBS domains. The CBS gene {{is the most}} common locus for mutations associated with homocystinuria.|$|E
25|$|In {{analogy with}} other β-replacement enzymes, the {{reaction}} catalyzed by <b>CBS</b> <b>is</b> predicted to involve {{a series of}} adoMet-bound intermediates. Addition of serine results in a transchiffization reaction, which forms of an external aldimine. The aldimine undergoes proton abstraction at the α-carbon followed by elimination to generate an amino-acrylate intermediate. Nucleophilic attack by the thiolate of homocysteine on the aminoacrylate and reprotonation at Cα generate the external aldimine of cystathionine. A final transaldimination reaction releases the final product, cystathionine. The final product, L-cystathionine can also form an aminoacrylate intermediate, indicating that the entire reaction of <b>CBS</b> <b>is</b> reversible.|$|E

25|$|Container-based {{sanitation}} (CBS) {{refers to}} a sanitation system where human excreta is collected in sealable, removable containers (or cartridges) that are transported to treatment facilities. Container-based sanitation is usually provided as a service involving provision of certain types of portable toilets, and collection of excreta at a cost borne by the users. With suitable development, support and functioning partnerships, CBS {{can be used to}} provide low-income urban populations with safe collection, transport and treatment of excrement at a lower cost than installing and maintaining sewers. In most cases, <b>CBS</b> <b>is</b> based on the use of urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E
40|$|Coiled bodies (<b>CBs)</b> <b>are</b> {{structural}} constituents {{observed in}} nuclei of most eukaryotic cells.

In this work we studied the hepatocyte nuclei of hibernating dormice in order to investigate possible modifications of CBs along the seasonal cycle. <b>CBs</b> <b>were</b> abundant during hibernation and rapidly disappeared upon arousal from hibernation. Moreover, <b>CBs</b> <b>were</b> frequently found to be integrated into the nucleolar body. Immunocytochemical analyses showed that CBs contain nucleoplasmic as well as nucleolar RNA-processing factors, suggesting an "ambiguous" role for this organelle in the nuclear functions...|$|R

25|$|In mammals, <b>CBS</b> <b>is</b> {{a highly}} {{regulated}} enzyme, which contains a heme cofactor that {{functions as a}} redox sensor, that can modulate its activity in response {{to changes in the}} redox potential. If the resting form of CBS in the cell has ferrous (Fe2+) heme, the potential exists for activating the enzyme under oxidizing conditions by conversion to the ferric (Fe3+) state. The Fe2+ form of the enzyme is inhibited upon binding CO or nitric oxide, whereas enzyme activity is doubled when the Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+. The redox state of the heme is pH dependent, with oxidation of Fe2+–CBS to Fe3+–CBS being favored at low pH conditions.|$|E
25|$|Pre-season {{coverage}} {{is produced by}} CBS, formerly using the NFL on CBS graphics package until the last contract ended as a remnant of WFRV's former ownership by the CBS Corporation itself until 2007. In 2012, the pre-season coverage began to use the NBC Sports Sunday Night Football graphics package due to WTMJ/WGBA's NBC affiliation. The TV play-by-play announcer, Kevin Harlan (also on loan from <b>CBS),</b> <b>is</b> the son of former Packers president Bob Harlan, with Rich Gannon joining him as color commentator. Since the 2008 pre-season all Packers preseason games on the statewide network are produced and aired in high definition, with WTMJ-TV subcontracting the games to minor network affiliates in Milwaukee during Summer Olympics years due to mandatory non-preemption policies by their network, NBC (this was not done in 2012 as the pre-season opener was a national ESPN game). In Green Bay, WACY carries preseason games in English if WGBA is unable to during Olympics years.|$|E
500|$|An October 1981 {{review in}} Rolling Stone called the concert [...] "one {{of the finest}} {{performances}} of [...] ", one that [...] "vividly recaptured another time, an era when well-crafted, melodic pop bore meanings that stretched beyond the musical sphere and into the realms of culture and politics." [...] This reviewer noted that Garfunkel's voice was noticeably restrained in high passages, though still harmonious, and that the evening's only weak spot was the [...] "Kodachrome"/"Maybellene" [...] medley, because neither singer could raise the right level of emotion for the rock songs. A Billboard reviewer wrote in March 1982, [...] "This 19 song, two record set gloriously recaptures the past with sterling renditions {{of most of the}} duo's classics as well as a few of Simon's solo compositions filled out by Garfunkel's harmony." [...] However, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice dismissed the album as [...] "a corporate boondoggle—a classy way for Warner Bros. artist Simon to rerecord, rerelease, and resell the catalogue <b>CBS</b> <b>is</b> sitting on." [...] He felt Simon had been better off without Garfunkel since 1971 and quipped, [...] "live doubles are live doubles, nostalgia is nostalgia, wimps are wimps, and who needs any of 'em?" ...|$|E

500|$|Arguing for {{the renewal}} of the series for a third season {{following}} its low viewership, Ryan said that [...] "letting the show die would be a serious mistake, for the network and for the bigger Disney-ABC conglomerate...These days, entertainment properties have to be viewed not just {{through the lens of}} their ratings (admittedly weak for Agent Carter). They have to be evaluated {{within the context of the}} overall value they bring to any entertainment colossus, and what Agent Carter adds to Disney-ABC is simply too valuable to give up... something different to the company's superhero portfolio." [...] She suggested if ABC did not renew the series for broadcast, that it should explore other opportunities, such as debuting on its online Watch ABC app, or being sold to Netflix, where [...] "fans of super-heroic storytelling already flock to" [...] and Agent Carters [...] "status as a period piece—which may have harmed it on broadcast—could be a real draw for Netflix viewers". Ryan also felt Marvel [...] "could copy what <b>CBS</b> <b>is</b> [...] " [...] by creating a subscription service for a monthly fee, where consumers could access Marvel's films and televisions shows [...] "as well as premium exclusives like a third season of Agent Carter". Ryan concluded, [...] "A third Agent Carter season could help solidify Marvel's standing not just with female fans, but with everyone who appreciates excellent and adventurous storytelling." ...|$|E

40|$|Homogenates of mouse liver with {{isotonic}} sucrose solution {{were separated}} by the cell fractionation with repeating centrifugation. The supernatants {{were used for the}} inhibition test with the reagents such as 3, 5 diiodosalicylic acid lithium salt (LIS), guanidine and azide, heat, acid and alkali. After various treatments, the remaining catalase activities were measured and showed as a relative enzyme activity. Stability of catalase in liver supernatants was compared normal (C 3 H/C(as) C(as)) and mutant mice which were designated acatalasemia (C 3 H/C(bs) C(bs)), hypocatalasemia (C 3 H/C(cs) C(cs)) and acatalasemic heterozygote (C 3 H/C(as) C(bs)).
