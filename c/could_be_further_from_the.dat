In England the suffrage movement existed {{before and after}} the 1832 act, but did not form a national organisation until the creation of the National Society for Women's Suffrage in 1872. Although there were notable exceptions such as the working-class areas of Lancashire, the women's suffrage movement in England was predominantly a middle-class movement. In Wales there were only two narrow bands of wealthy society in the Anglicised north and south coastal areas. Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low-waged, densely-populated, industrialised valleys of the south. At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction, but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground. The coal mining industry, with its absence of pithead baths, led to unpaid women's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family's menfolk clean became a never ending task. This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam, a matriarch of the home, but little <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth in a society controlled by men.|$|E

Jewish resistance to the Nazis comprised not only their armed struggle but also spiritual and cultural opposition which gave the Jews dignity despite the inhumane conditions {{of life in the}} ghettos. Many forms of resistance were present, even though the elders were terrified by the prospect of mass retaliation against the women and children in the case of anti-Nazi revolt. As the German authorities undertook to liquidate the ghettos, armed resistance was offered in over 100 locations on either side of Polish-Soviet border of 1939, overwhelmingly in eastern Poland. The uprisings erupted in 5 major cities, 45 provincial towns, 5 major concentration and extermination camps, as well as in at least 18 forced labor camps. Notably, the only rebellions in Nazi camps were Jewish.|$|E

500|$|Zeta Psi ("Zete") at Dartmouth College {{was founded}} in 1853 as the Psi Epsilon chapter of the {{national}} fraternity, and was the fifth fraternity founded at the college. [...] The fraternity became inactive in 1863, but was revived from 1871 through 1873 after which it again became inactive. [...] The current Psi Epsilon Chapter of Zeta Psi at Dartmouth was established in 1920. [...] In 2001, the Dartmouth chapter was derecognized by the college because [...] "the fraternity harassed specific fellow students and violated ethical standards that Dartmouth student organizations agree to uphold, by periodically creating and circulating among Zeta Psi members 'newsletters' that purported to describe situations, some of them of a sexual nature, of various members of the fraternity and other students." [...] Zeta Psi, meanwhile, countered that [...] "nothing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth... Dartmouth College lacks jurisdiction to punish Psi Epsilon of Zeta Psi's for alleged violations of its own rules or regulations,". [...] From 2001 to 2006, Zeta Psi continued to operate as an independent fraternity, not officially recognized by Dartmouth College. In January 2007, Dartmouth College announced an agreement that would allow Zeta Psi to reorganize on campus as early as 2009. Part of the agreement dictated that the organization [...] "go dark", with no activities or recruiting, for a period of two years. [...] During these two years, alumni raised millions of dollars and the physical plant was entirely gutted and renovated, with a three-story addition being constructed on the west-side of the house. Also, the basement was enlarged. [...] On October 12, 2009, the Psi Epsilon Association of Zeta Psi Fraternity (Dartmouth Zete's alumni association) announced that 35 undergraduates had joined the newly re-recognized fraternity.

On 30 November 2015, the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif retreated from earlier positions and said that it denies any role by Pakistan in atrocities in Bangladesh. A statement of the Pakistani Foreign Ministry, after summoning the Acting Bangladeshi High Commissioner, said that [...] "Pakistan also rejected insinuation of complicity in committing crimes or war atrocities. Nothing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth". The statement marked a growing trend of genocide denial in Pakistan, which picked up pace after controversial Indian academic Sarmila Bose accused the Mukti Bahini of war crimes.

2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{then moved}} towards the January 19 South Carolina primary, the state which effectively ended McCain's 2000 campaign for President. Unlike 2000, McCain {{had the support}} of much of the state Republican establishment, both in terms of endorsements and campaign staff support. Nevertheless a bit of 2000 surfaced when a group of unknown size called [...] "Vietnam Veterans Against John McCain" [...] set up a website and began sending crude mailers to media members alleging that McCain passed military information to the North Vietnamese during his time as a POW. McCain set up a Truth Squad to combat such attacks and emphasized that he was supported by 75 former POWs. Orson Swindle, who was a POW with McCain, called the flier a [...] "vicious" [...] fraud. [...] "Nothing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth," [...] Swindle said. [...] "I know because I was there.

That same year he wrote: [...] "The scientific base for a greenhouse warming is too uncertain to justify drastic action at this time." [...] Will and other critics of Sen. Al Gore have seized these words to suggest that Revelle, who was also Gore's professor and mentor, renounced his belief in global warming. Nothing <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>further</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truth. When Revelle inveighed against [...] "drastic" [...] action, he was using that adjective in its literal sense—measures that would cost trillions of dollars.

Some of those steps go well beyond anything Gore or other national politicians have yet to advocate. [...] Revelle proposed a range of approaches to address global warming. Inaction was not one of them. He agreed with the adage [...] "look before you leap," [...] but he never said [...] "sit on your hands." ...|$|E
