5|$|Advances in bioinformatics, {{refinements}} of DNA amplification, and {{the proliferation}} of computational power have greatly aided the analysis of DNA sequences recovered from environmental samples, allowing the adaptation of shotgun sequencing to metagenomic samples (known also as whole metagenome shotgun or WMGS sequencing). The approach, used to sequence many cultured microorganisms and the human genome, randomly shears DNA, sequences many short sequences, and reconstructs them into a <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence.</b> Shotgun sequencing reveals genes present in environmental samples. Historically, clone libraries were used to facilitate this sequencing. However, with advances in high throughput sequencing technologies, the cloning step is no longer necessary and greater yields of sequencing data can be obtained without this labour-intensive bottleneck step. Shotgun metagenomics provides information both about which organisms are present and what metabolic processes are possible in the community. Because the collection of DNA from an environment is largely uncontrolled, the most abundant organisms in an environmental sample are most highly represented in the resulting sequence data. To achieve the high coverage needed to fully resolve the genomes of under-represented community members, large samples, often prohibitively so, are needed. On the other hand, the random nature of shotgun sequencing ensures that many of these organisms, which would otherwise go unnoticed using traditional culturing techniques, will be represented by at least some small sequence segments.|$|E

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{algorithms}} {{have been developed to}} facilitate detection of promoters in genomic sequence, and promoter prediction is a common element of many gene prediction methods. A promoter region is located before the -35 and -10 <b>Consensus</b> <b>sequences.</b> The closer the promoter region is to the <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> the more often transcription of that gene will take place. There is not a set pattern for promoter regions as there are for <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> {{are widely}} used in {{molecular}} biology but they have many flaws. As a result, binding sites of proteins and other molecules are missed during studies of genetic sequences and important biological effects cannot be seen. Information theory provides a mathematically robust way to avoid <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences.</b> Instead of using <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences,</b> sequence conservation can be quantitatively presented in bits of information by using sequence logo graphics to represent the average {{of a set of}} sites and sequence walker graphics to represent individual sites...|$|R
25|$|Trimmed {{sequences}} {{from the}} previous step are aligned to the reference genome using Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA) and the unmapped reads are removed. The aligned reads that have the same 24 bp tag sequence and genomic region are detected and grouped together (Family αβ and βα in the figure 2). Each group represents a “tag family”. Tag families with lower than three members are removed from the analysis. To remove errors arise during PCR amplification or sequencing, mutations that are supported by less than 70% of the members (reads) are filtered out from the analysis. Then a <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence</b> is generated for each family using the identical sequences in each position of the remaining reads. The <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence</b> is called single strand <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence</b> (SSCS). The SSCS method increases the NGS accuracy to about 20 fold higher, however this method relies on the sequencing information from single strands of DNA and therefore is sensitive to the errors induced at the first round or before PCR amplification.|$|E

An oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) for HBV lamivudine-resistance was developed and compared to <b>consensus</b> <b>sequencing.</b> Both assays detected drug resistance mutations in 35 / 64 (54. 7 %) specimens evaluated, and OLA detected minority mutants in an additional six (9. 4 %).

25|$|The main, and obvious, {{advantage}} of <b>consensus</b> logos over <b>sequence</b> logos is {{their ability to}} be embedded as text in any Rich Text Format supporting editor/viewer and, therefore, in scientific manuscripts. As described above, the consensus logo is a cross between <b>sequence</b> logos and <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences.</b> As a result, compared to a <b>sequence</b> logo, the <b>consensus</b> logo omits information (the relative contribution of each character to the conservation of that position in the motif/alignment). Hence, a sequence logo should be used preferentially whenever possible. That being said, the need to include graphic figures in order to display sequence logos has perpetuated the use of <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> in scientific manuscripts, even though they fail to convey information on both conservation and frequency. Consensus logos represent therefore an improvement over <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> whenever motif/alignment information has to be constrained to text.|$|R
25|$|VPg uridylylation {{may include}} the use of {{precursor}} proteins, allowing for the determination of a possible mechanism for the location of the diuridylylated, VPg-containing precursor at the 3’ end of plus- or minus-strand RNA for production of full-length RNA. Determinants of VPg uridylylation efficiency suggest formation and/or collapse or release of the uridylylated product as the rate-limiting step in vitro depending upon the VPg donor employed. Precursor proteins also have an effect on VPg-CRE specificity and stability. The upper RNA stem loop, to which VPg binds, has a significant impact on both retention, and recruitment, of VPg and Pol. The stem loop of CRE will partially unwind, allowing the precursor components to bind and recruit VPg and Pol4. The CRE loop has a defined <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence</b> to which the initiation components bind, however; there is no <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence</b> for the supporting stem, which suggests that only the structural stability of the CRE is important.|$|E
25|$|Single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) {{are single}} bases within a gene sequence {{that differ from}} that gene's <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence,</b> and are present in {{a subset of the}} population.

40|$|AbstractWe {{evaluated}} phenotypic markers in full-genome {{sequences of}} avian influenza isolates to identify avian strains with increased potential for transmission and pathogenicity in mammals. Of 149 markers examined, 67 were positive in the <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> from 206 avian isolates. Analysis of deep sequencing {{data in a}} subset of 24 isolates revealed that 344 subpopulations occurred at marker positions. Markers in subpopulations {{were significantly more likely}} to be negative (258 / 344) than positive (86 / 344), but nearly all of the marker-positive subpopulations (78 / 86) were associated with marker-negative <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences.</b> Our analysis revealed significant variation in important markers among avian isolates, and showed that <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> do not fully convey an isolate's potential for increased transmissibility and pathogenicity in mammals...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: A typical PSI-BLAST search {{consists}} of iterative scanning and alignment {{of a large}} sequence database during which a scoring profile is progressively built and refined. Such a profile can also be stored and used to search against a different database of sequences. Using it to search against a database of consensus rather than native sequences is a simple add-on that boosts performance surprisingly well. The improvement comes at a price: we hypothesized that random alignment score statistics would differ between native and <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences.</b> Thus PSI-BLAST-based profile searches against <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> might incorrectly estimate statistical significance of alignment scores. In addition, iterative searches against consensus databases may fail. Here, we addressed these challenges {{in an attempt to}} harness the full power of the combination of PSI-BLAST and <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences...</b>|$|R

From a sample size of 40 reverse transcriptase (RT) <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> from drug-naive individuals we found five showing NRTI and four showing NNRTI mutations with one individual showing both. From 29 protease <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences,</b> again from drug-naive individuals, we found evidence of minor DRMs in three. Additional major and minor DRMs were found in clonal sequences {{from a number of}} individuals that were not present in the original <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences.</b> This clearly illustrates the importance of sequencing multiple HIV- 1 variants from individuals to fully assess drug resistance...|$|R

The SUMOplot score system is based on two criteria: 1) direct amino acid match to the SUMO-CS observed and shown to bind Ubc9, and 2) substitution of the consensus amino acid residues with amino acid residues exhibiting similar hydrophobicity. SUMOplot has been used in the past to predict Ubc9 dependent sites.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of transport {{has been described}} as similar to an air lock. When the ligand is bound, it is hypothesized to close the pore at the extracellular side, thus preventing anything from exiting through the pore. FepA then interacts with TonB through a 5 amino acid <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence,</b> which induces a change to the N-terminal opening a channel to the periplasmic side. This would allow FepA to transport ferric-enterobactin without allowing ions and small molecules from passing in either direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{reads from}} last step are realigned to the {{reference}} genome. In this method SSCS family pairs that have complementary tags will be grouped together (Family αβ and βα in figure 2).

40|$|International audienceWhen activated, NF-κB {{can promote}} the nuclear import and {{transcription}} of DNA possessing NF-κB <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences.</b> Here, we investigated whether NF-κB {{is involved in}} the plasmid electrotransfer process. Mouse tibial cranial muscles were transfected with plasmids encoding luciferase bearing or not NF-κB <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences.</b> Luciferase transgene expression was evaluated noninvasively by luminescence imaging and the number of pDNA copies in the same muscles by qPCR. RT-PCR of heat shock protein HsP 70 mRNA evidenced cell stress. Western blots of phosphorylated IkBα were studied as a marker of NF-κB activation. Intra-muscular injection of a plasmid bearing a weak TATA-like promoter results in a very low muscle transfection level. Electrotransfer significantly increased both the number of pDNA copy and the transgene expression of this plasmid per DNA copy. Insertion of NF-κB <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> into pDNA significantly increased the level of gene expression both with and without electrotransfer. Electrotransfer-induced cellular stress was evidenced by increased HsP 70 mRNA. Phosphorylated IκBα was slightly increased by simple pDNA injection and a little more by electrotransfer. We also observed a basal level of phosphorylated IκBα and thus of free NF-κB {{in the absence of any}} stimulation. pDNA electrotransfer can increase transgene expression independently of NF-κB. The insertion of NF-κB <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> into pDNA bearing a weak TATA-like promoter leads to enhanced transgene expression in muscle with or without gene electrotransfer. Finally, our results suggest that the basal amount of free NF-κB in muscle might be sufficient to enhance the activity of pDNA bearing NF-κB <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{classical}} recognition {{motif of}} the AhR/ARNT complex, {{referred to as}} either the AhR-, dioxin- or xenobiotic- responsive element (AHRE, DRE or XRE), contains the core sequence 5'-GCGTG-3' within the <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence</b> 5'-T/GNGCGTGA/CG/CA-3' in the promoter region of AhR responsive genes. The AhR/ARNT heterodimer directly binds the AHRE/DRE/XRE core sequence in an asymmetric manner such that ARNT binds to 5'-GTG-3' and AhR binding 5'-TC/TGC-3'. Recent research suggests that a second type of element termed AHRE-II, 5'-CATG(N6)CTG-3', is capable of indirectly acting with the AhR/ARNT complex. Regardless of the response element, {{the end result is}} a variety of differential changes in gene expression.|$|E
25|$|GPCR linked {{proteins}} {{most likely}} interact with steroid hormones through an amino acid <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence</b> traditionally {{thought of as}} a cholesterol recognition and interaction site. About a third of Class A GPCRs contain this sequence. The steroid hormones themselves are different enough from one another that they do not all affect all of the GPCR linked proteins; however, the similarities between the steroid hormones and between the receptors make plausible the argument that each receptor may respond to multiple steroid hormones or that each hormone could affect multiple receptors. This is contrary to the traditional model of having a unique receptor for each unique ligand.|$|E
25|$|This is {{an example}} of exon skipping. The intron {{upstream}} from exon 4 has a polypyrimidine tract that doesn't match the <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence</b> well, so that U2AF proteins bind poorly to it without assistance from splicing activators. This 3' splice acceptor site is therefore not used in males. Females, however, produce the splicing activator Transformer (Tra) (see below). The SR protein Tra2 is produced in both sexes and binds to an ESE in exon 4; if Tra is present, it binds to Tra2 and, along with another SR protein, forms a complex that assists U2AF proteins in binding to the weak polypyrimidine tract. U2 is recruited to the associated branchpoint, and this leads to inclusion of exon 4 in the mRNA.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) {{have played}} {{significant}} roles in gene discovery and gene functional analysis, especially for non-model organisms. For organisms with no full genome sequences available, ESTs are normally assembled into longer <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> for further downstream analysis. However current de novo EST assembly programs often generate {{large number of}} assembly errors that will negatively affect the downstream analysis. In order to generate more accurate <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> from ESTs, tools are needed to reduce or eliminate errors from de novo assemblies. Results We present iAssembler, a pipeline that can assemble large-scale ESTs into <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> with significantly higher accuracy than current existing assemblers. iAssembler employs MIRA and CAP 3 assemblers to generate initial assemblies, followed by identifying and correcting two common types of transcriptome assembly errors: 1) ESTs from different transcripts (mainly alternatively spliced transcripts or paralogs) are incorrectly assembled into same contigs; and 2) ESTs from same transcripts fail to be assembled together. iAssembler {{can be used to}} assemble ESTs generated using the traditional Sanger method and/or the Roche- 454 massive parallel pyrosequencing technology. Conclusion We compared performances of iAssembler and several other de novo EST assembly programs using both Roche- 454 and Sanger EST datasets.

3000|$|The {{traditional}} HMM {{assumes that}} a 1 st order Markov property holds {{among the states}} and that each observable depends only on the corresponding state and not any other observable. The current work entails a maximally interpolated departure from that convention (according to training dataset size) {{in an attempt to}} leverage anomalous statistical information in the neighborhood of coding-noncoding transitions (e.g., the exon-intron, introns-exon, junk-exon, or exon-junk transitions, collectively denoted as [...] "eij-transitions"). The regions of anomalous statistics are often highly structured, having <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> that strongly depart from the strong independence assumptions of the 1 st order HMM. The existence of such <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> suggests that we adopt an observation model that has a higher order Markov property with respect to the observations. Furthermore, since the <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> vary by the type of transition, this observational Markov order should be allowed to vary depending on the state.|$|R
25|$|Other, {{less well}} characterised substrate-binding sites also exist. One such site (the DEF site) is {{formed by the}} {{activation}} loop (when in the active conformation) and the MAP kinase-specific insert below it. This site can accommodate peptides with an FxFP <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence,</b> typically downstream of the phosphorylation site. Note that the latter site can only be found in proteins that need to selectively recognize the active MAP kinases, thus they are almost exclusively found in substrates. Different motifs may cooperate with each other, as in the Elk family of transcription factors, that possess both a D-motif and an FxFP motif. The presence of an FxFP motif in the KSR1 scaffold protein also serves {{to make it an}} ERK1/2 substrate, providing a negative feedback mechanism to set the correct strength of ERK1/2 activation.|$|E
25|$|The NS5B protein (65 kDa) is the viral RNA {{dependent}} RNA polymerase. NS5B has the key {{function of}} replicating the HCV’s viral RNA {{by using the}} viral positive RNA strand as its template and catalyzes the polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTP) during RNA replication. Several crystal structures of NS5B polymerase in several crystalline forms have been determined {{based on the same}} <b>consensus</b> <b>sequence</b> BK (HCV-BK, genotype 1). The structure can be represented by a right hand shape with fingers, palm, and thumb. The encircled active site, unique to NS5B, is contained within the palm structure of the protein. Recent studies on NS5B protein genotype 1b strain J4’s (HC-J4) structure indicate a presence of an active site where possible control of nucleotide binding occurs and initiation of de-novo RNA synthesis. De-novo adds necessary primers for initiation of RNA replication. Current research attempts to bind structures to this active site to alter its functionality in order to prevent further viral RNA replication.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Insulin-like {{growth factor}} binding protein (IGFBP) - 3 {{functions}} as a carrier of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in circulation and a mediator of the growth suppression signal in cells. There are two reported p 53 regulatory regions in the IGFBP 3 gene; one upstream of the promoter and one intronic. We previously reported a hot spot of promoter hypermethylation of IGFBP- 3 in human hepatocellular carcinomas and derivative cell lines. As the hot spot locates at the putative upstream p 53 <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences,</b> these p 53 <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> are really functional is a question to be answered. Methods In this study, we examined the p 53 <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> upstream of the IGFBP- 3 promoter for the p 53 induced expression of IGFBP- 3. Deletion, mutagenesis, and methylation constructs of IGFBP- 3 promoter were assessed in the human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG 2 for promoter activity. Results Deletions and mutations of these sequences completely abolished the expression of IGFBP- 3 {{in the presence of}} p 53 overexpression. In vitro methylation of these p 53 <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> also suppressed IGFBP- 3 expression. In contrast, the expression of IGFBP- 3 was not affected in the absence of p 53 overexpression. Further, we observed by electrophoresis mobility shift assay that p 53 binding to the promoter region was diminished when methylated. Conclusion From these observations, we conclude that four out of eleven p 53 <b>consensus</b> <b>sequences</b> upstream of the IGFBP- 3 promoter are essential for the p 53 induced expression of IGFBP- 3, and hypermethylation of these sequences selectively suppresses p 53 induced IGFBP- 3 expression in HepG 2 cells. </p...|$|R
