5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that <b>cognitive</b> <b>functions</b> were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E

We report {{the associations}} between cardiac and peripheral vascular disease and <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> for a large representative sample of men in Caerphilly, South Wales, UK. DESIGN: The Caerphilly cohort {{is the basis of}} on-going studies of vascular disease, of <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> and of predictors of these. We have made intensive attempts to identify all cases of vascular disease: myocardial infarction, angina, ECG ischaemia, peripheral vascular disease (intermittent claudication) and stroke. Here we present data on associations between vascular disease and <b>cognitive</b> <b>function.</b> SETTING: The study is based upon a representative population sample of over 1, 500 men in South Wales, aged 55 - 69 years when <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> was measured. The men, and hospital and GP notes relating to them, had been repeatedly examined for evidence of vascular disease during the previous ten years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standard tests of cognitive function: the AH 4, CAMCOG, MMSE and choice reaction time. RESULTS: After the omission of men who had had a stroke, we detected significant associations between <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> and the presence of angina, ECG ischaemia, past myocardial infarction and intermittent claudication. The strength of the associations between <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> and the various manifestations of vascular disease were similar, and the various <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> tests showed effects of similar size. Overall, cardiac and peripheral vascular disease is associated with a significant reduction in <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> equivalent to about one sixth of the standard deviation of a number of tests of <b>cognitive</b> <b>function.</b> The size of this effect is roughly equivalent to the decline in cognitive performance over five years of ageing.

5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving <b>cognitive</b> <b>functions.</b> Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E

MethodsWe used two large genome-wide association study data sets on cognitive function—one from older age, n = 53, 949, and one from childhood, n = 12, 441. We also used genome-wide association study data on educational attainment, n = 95, 427, to examine the validity of its use as a proxy phenotype for <b>cognitive</b> <b>function.</b> Using a new method, linkage disequilibrium regression, we derived genetic correlations, free from the confounding of clinical state between {{psychiatric illness}} and <b>cognitive</b> <b>function.</b> ResultsWe found a genetic correlation of. 711 (p = 2. 26 e- 12) across the life course for general <b>cognitive</b> <b>function.</b> We also showed a positive genetic correlation between autism spectrum disorder and <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> in childhood (rg =. 360, p =. 0009) and for educational attainment (rg =. 322, p = 1. 37 e- 5) but not in older age. In schizophrenia, we found a negative genetic correlation between older age <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> (rg = −. 231, p = 3. 81 e- 12) but not in childhood or for educational attainment. For Alzheimer’s disease, we found negative genetic correlations with childhood <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> (rg = −. 341, p =. 001), educational attainment (rg = −. 324, p = 1. 15 e- 5), and with older age <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> (rg = −. 324, p = 1. 78 e- 5). ConclusionsThe pleiotropy exhibited between <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> and psychiatric disorders changed across the life course.

40|$|Deteriorations in <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> {{and sleep}} are the {{inevitable}} {{parts of the}} ageing process, and they are two very common complaints among the elderly population. Given their high relevance and great impact on daily functioning, many studies have attempted to address the associations of sleep problems and <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> with ageing, yet the direction of associations remained unclear. Several recent studies suggested that caffeine, a common psychostimulant present in coffee and tea, might have a beneficial effect on agerelated decline in <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning.</b> Nonetheless, the dose-dependent effect of caffeine intake on specific domains of <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> and the potential cost of compromised nocturnal sleep at high dose of caffeine remained to be investigated. In view {{of the lack of}} study on identifying the correlation and interaction between sleep, <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> caffeine consumption habit, and age, this thesis reported two studies that clarified these relationships in the elderly population. Furthermore, the studies explored the possibility to utilize sleep and caffeine as a regimen to improve daytime <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> in the older population. Study 1 was a retrospective study that aimed {{to examine the relationship between}} sleep, habitual caffeine consumption, <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> and mood in the two different age groups, the young adult and the elderly. Eighty-nine healthy elderly and forty-three healthy young adults participated in this study and completed a battery of neuropsychological assessment and a set of questionnaires. Findings revealed changes in multiple domains of sleep and <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> upon ageing. The age-related differences in sleep and <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> were correlated. Moreover, result suggested that regular caffeine consumption has a dose-dependent beneficial effect on <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> but the effect was only observed in female. Study 2 was built on the relationship between sleep, <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> and caffeine as found in Study 1. It aimed to investigate the effect of caffeine and daytime nap on the <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> in the healthy elderly adopting a repeated measure, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Twenty-four healthy elderly were recruited for this study, and each of them were required to attend four experimental sessions with a one-week intersession interval. In each session, participants were required to take a rest or take a nap with or without a certain dosage of caffeine in the afternoon. Comparisons on their cognitive performance before and after the rest/ nap revealed an effect of nap and caffeine on improving subjective feeling of sleepiness and fatigue. Behavioural measurements revealed no effect on daytime nap on <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> yet specific sleep stage and certain sleep oscillations were associated with post-nap changes in <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning.</b> In summary, the present studies demonstrated the associations of sleep and caffeine consumption with <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning</b> in the elderly. Habitual caffeine consumption was associated with a female-specific beneficial effect on <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning.</b> Furthermore, daytime nap combined with the use of acute dose of caffeine might not enhance <b>cognitive</b> <b>functioning,</b> but could improve mood and well-being in the elderly. Findings from present studies suggested that further research could explore ways to maximise the benefit of napping in the elderly. published_or_final_versionPsychologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

This study explores the relationships between childhood health and disadvantage, psychiatric history, and <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> in later life using six waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Growth curve models are used to analyze these relationships, controlling for demographics, health behavior, and health status. Findings indicate that a history of psychiatric problems is associated with lower <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> at age 65 and steeper declines in <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> with age. Childhood disadvantage is also associated with lower <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> at age 65, but not with rate of cognitive decline. The influence of childhood health on cognition is mediated by later-life health status and behaviors. A combined history of childhood disadvantage and psychiatric problems more strongly affects <b>cognitive</b> <b>function</b> at age 65, but cognitive decline rates remain consistent with those associated with psychiatric history alone. These effects are partially mediated by later-life demographic, socioeconomic, or health characteristics...|$|R
