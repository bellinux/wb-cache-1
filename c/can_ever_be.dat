5|$|Meanwhile, Kadaj and {{his colleagues}} are {{recruiting}} children infected with Geostigma. Denzel falls in with the group, attracted by their promises of a cure for the disease. Loz follows Tifa and Marlene to Aerith's church, where they had gone looking for Cloud, and attacks them. Tifa is knocked unconscious in the fight and Loz kidnapped Marlene. All the kidnapped children are taken to the ruins of the mystical Forgotten City, where Kadaj embraces them as brethren and announces his intention for them all to be reunited with Jenova. When Cloud arrives to rescue them, he is overpowered by Kadaj's gang, but is rescued by his old comrade Vincent Valentine. Demoralized by his failure, Cloud asks if sin <b>can</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> truly forgiven, to which Vincent nonchalantly replies that he has never tried to forgive. Cloud decides to keep fighting and returns to the city, where Kadaj has summoned Bahamut SIN and other monsters to terrorize the population. With the help of his companions from Final Fantasy VII, Cloud engages and defeats the monsters.|$|E
5|$|The peak random write {{performance}} on an SSD {{is driven by}} plenty of free blocks after the SSD is completely garbage collected, secure erased, 100% TRIMed, or newly installed. The maximum speed will depend upon the number of parallel flash channels connected to the SSD controller, {{the efficiency of the}} firmware, and the speed of the flash memory in writing to a page. During this phase the write amplification will be the best it <b>can</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> for random writes and will be approaching one. Once the blocks are all written once, garbage collection will begin and the performance will be gated by the speed and efficiency of that process. Write amplification in this phase will increase to the highest levels the drive will experience.|$|E

The Scottish historian Alexander Tytler, in his Essay on the Principles of Translation (1790), emphasized that assiduous reading is a more comprehensive guide to a language than are dictionaries. The same point, but also including listening to the spoken language, had earlier, in 1783, been made by the Polish poet and grammarian Onufry Andrzej Kopczyński.|$|E
25|$|Some learned {{men have}} thought they {{discovered}} some vestiges of vampirism in the remotest antiquity; {{but all that}} they say of it does not come near what is related of the vampires. The lamiæ, the strigæ, the sorcerers whom they accused of sucking the blood of living persons, and of thus causing their death, the magicians who were said to cause the death of new-born children by charms and malignant spells, are nothing less than what we understand {{by the name of}} vampires; even were it to be owned that these lamiæ and strigæ have really existed, which we do not believe <b>can</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> well proved.|$|E
25|$|The shared {{beliefs of}} Orthodoxy, and its theology, exist within the Holy Tradition and cannot be {{separated}} from it, for their meaning is not expressed in mere words alone. Doctrine cannot be understood unless it is prayed. To be a theologian, one must know how to pray, and one who prays in spirit and in truth becomes a theologian by doing so. Doctrine must also be lived {{in order to be}} prayed, for without action, the prayer is idle and empty, a mere vanity, and therefore the theology of demons. According to these teachings of the ancient church, no superficial belief <b>can</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> orthodox. Similarly, reconciliation and unity are not superficial, but are prayed and lived out.|$|E

25|$|Some {{commentators}} have expressed {{the view that}} excessive value has been placed by the courts on protecting {{the independence of the}} judiciary, and that insufficient weight has been given to the right to freedom of speech. One assumption said to be incorrect is that undermining public confidence in the administration of justice is in all circumstances harmful to the public interest. Arguably, if the scandalizing allegation is true or is an opinion honestly and reasonably held, then it is in the public interest that such speech be heard precisely because {{of the importance of the}} judiciary to society. However, common law rules of contempt do not recognize the defence of either justification or fair comment which are available to the tort of defamation. Secondly, the claim that scandalizing the court may undermine public confidence in the judiciary represents an unduly pessimistic view of the maturity and ability of the Singapore public to assess for itself whether or not the scandalizing speech is true, and is perhaps a sweeping statement as to general public awareness. Lastly, it is also assumed that public confidence in the judiciary can be preserved by the suppression of scandalizing speech. However, it is unlikely that such speech <b>can</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> completely suppressed. It would be impossible to monitor speech that goes on in homes, coffee shops and hawker centres. Through these informal channels, suspicions of the judiciary may fester and grow.|$|E

500|$|After {{establishing}} that {{he would}} refrain from using extra-Biblical sources to inform his criticism, but would instead apply the Bible's own words against itself, Paine questions the sacredness of the Bible, analyzing it as one would any other book. For example, {{in his analysis of}} the Book of Proverbs he argues that its sayings are [...] "inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wise and economical than those of the American Franklin". Describing the Bible as [...] "fabulous mythology", Paine questions {{whether or not it was}} revealed to its writers and doubts that the original writers <b>can</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> known (he dismisses the idea that Moses wrote the Pentateuch or that the Gospel's authors are known, for example).|$|E

[...] "But whether or not Benjamin practiced Judaism overtly or contributed to Jewish causes, to the Jews of the South, he was a symbol of a coreligionist who was a man among men". According to Evans, [...] "Benjamin survives, as he willed it: a shadowy figure in Civil War history". Kahn noted that Benjamin [...] "is epitomized as a foremost orator, lawyer, and statesman, without a peer at the bars of two of the world's greatest nations".

500|$|Mansfield {{made another}} notable {{judgment}} in , {{in relation to}} copyright law. Andrew Millar was a bookseller who in 1729 had purchased the publishing rights to James Thomson's poem [...] "The Seasons". After the term of the exclusive rights granted under the Statute of Anne expired, Robert Taylor began publishing his own competing publication, which contained Thomson's poem. Mansfield, sitting with three other judges, concluded that despite the Statute of Anne there was a perpetual common law copyright, and therefore that no works <b>can</b> <b>ever</b> <b>be</b> considered public domain. This was a massive victory for booksellers and publishers, as it meant that they could effectively {{make it impossible for}} new companies to compete, as in the absence of new texts, there was nothing they could print. Mansfield's judgment was finally overruled by the House of Lords in Donaldson v Beckett in 1774.|$|E
