5|$|Ammianus {{reports that}} 6,000 Germans perished on the {{battlefield}} and in the pursuit on land. (Libanius gives a figure of 8,000). Thousands more drowned {{as they tried to}} get across the river. It is thus likely that {{about a third of the}} German force lost their lives. However, it appears that the majority escaped, including the eight reges alongside Chnodomar. The Romans lost just 243 men, including four tribuni (regimental <b>commanders)</b> <b>of</b> which two were <b>commanders</b> <b>of</b> cataphracti.|$|E

Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to destroy it, and no copy has been found.|$|E

The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced to fight in isolation.|$|E
