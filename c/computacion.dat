Aerial or satellital {{images can}} be used to produce terrain {{coverage}} maps, which in time are a very useful and important tool for decision-making people in several fields including biodiversity, telecommunications and natural disaster management. The Trace Transform method {{can be used to}} process these images. This method extracts features from the images by applying a series of functionals to produce a numeric representation that will be used for classification later on. This model depends on several factors in order to have an efficient operation, among them, the frequency parameters of the traces, classifier type and land coverage. The purpose of this research is to create a model of sensibility to the frequency parameters of the Trace Transform for the classification of textures in aerial images. Experimentation on feature extraction time and precision rate revealed that the frequency parameters, specially the pixel selection paramenter, Dt, and the classifier type have a big effect both of them.

We {{live in a}} {{world in}} which a huge amount of data is {{generated}} on a daily basis, where even the amount of data generated daily follows an increasing trend. However, our analysis capabilities are limited, preventing us from analyzing all this data in order to use it to improve our decision making process. This problem is present in many areas of the human endeavor, one of them being the design of very large scale integrated circuits. Precisely in this area, the idea of creating a methodology to develop data mining systems optimized for a specific area is born. That methodology is described, step by step, in this thesis. It is then applied in the area of design of very large scale integrated circuits. The results are explained in detail, demonstrating the effectiveness not only of the methodology, but also of applying data mining techniques to improve the decision making process. The document ends with a list of recommendations to improve the data mining system that was developed. This, through training programs as well as tool and database enhancements.

Access {{to large}} data, {{especially}} for text processing applications, results in more eﬀec tive algorithms and therefore becomes transcendental {{to take advantage}} of these large amounts of data. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm which beneﬁts from these features and can be used for synonym detection and extraction. LSA takes advantage of the implicit semantic structure that exists in the association between documents and the terms they contain to statistically analyze the relationships between the terms of the collection of text documents; and because it uses a strictly mathematical approach, it is inherently independent of language. This is a thesis for the Masters in Computing degree that analyzes the LSA algorithm in a distributed environment, in order to evaluate its eﬀect for synonym detection and extraction on larger collections of data.

The species' {{distribution}} {{models are}} normally feed by occurrences, geo referenced data points where a specie has been seen, and climatic {{information such as}} precipitation, solar radiation, temperature, among others. The species geographic distribution not only depends on those variables, {{there are other factors}} such as the relationship between the species or the geographic barriers, as ridges and lakes. The present research try {{to improve the quality of}} the species' distribution models by including the relationship between the species. In order to achieve that three bird species and the relationship with the plants which serve them as food were defined. The selected species are the lapa verde (Ara ambiguus) and its relationship with the almendro amarillo (Dipteryx panamensis), the pájaro campana (Procnias tricarunculatus) and its relationship with the Lauracea family and finally the quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) and its relationship with the Lauracea family as well. In order to include the relationship between species into the species' distribution models a methodology in order to build a layer of "range of influence" were defined; with this new layer a set of experiments were defined, and those experiments verifies that by including the relationships between the species into the species' distribution models improve their precision. In order to measure the improvements the AUC curve were calculated for each model, in that way a numeric comparison were done. Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica.

Due to {{the impact}} of {{environmental}} pollution, it is valuable to produce high quality biofuels and to leverage organic waste that normally would have no use. Through Synthetic Biology, the science of designing and building new biological systems, it is possible to improve existing organisms to process waste that is not traditionally used for biofuels production, such as butter milk. Metabolic pathways are a set of chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes that carry out essential functions within cells. Through the redesign of these pathways, it is possible to create connections that allow for the implementation of new functions that normally are not present in nature. From a computational point of view, metabolic pathways, which can be found in data sources as the Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), can be converted to basic data structures, such as graphs. These transformations enable the application of well known algorithms, which allows for the optimization of the analyses required to achieve the assembly of new organisms. The present work aims to design a tool that allows for the transformation of metabolic pathways and the development of path finding algorithms that establish relevant links between compounds that are essential to the production of biofuels. As a result, a catalog of biobricks will be created from the analysis of a subset of paths. This will allow for the synthetic assembly of the E. Coli bacteria. The assembly's structure and functions will be characterized according to the pieces used. Finally, new constructions will be visualized with the goal of demonstrating and supporting the analysis processes, thus, assisting people that work in the field of Synthetic Biology.

Mobile devices {{known as}} {{smartphones}} are evolving to incorporate several processors and a RAM memory greater than a gigabyte {{in response to}} the high resource demand of today’s software applications. These devices were designed to be highly available information devices and are equipped with special features for that purpose; they are designed in a way that facilitates their mobility from place to place and {{with the use of a}} battery as a power source to provide considerable autonomy. Even with the recent evolution of these devices, the goal for them remains the same: high information availability (anytime, anywhere). These devices are not designed for high computational loads, the processor’s intensive work blocks the high availability of information (a busy processor doesn’t address alternate requests for information handling), however, the increasing power of these devices opens the scenario for using the concurrent processing features of their multiple processors for other possibilities. Also, given the ir current popularity and ubiquity, these devices may become useful in the distributed computing scenario, where the solution of complex computational tasks may be shared between many devices [29]. Nowadays there are yet some applications requiring information intensive processing on the smartphones [17] [28] [38]. Concurrent programming offers promising approaches to help in the creation of parallel and distributed systems. The Actors Model [7] is an interesting paradigm because it is a design that helps to minimize complex programming errors using the system resources in parallel and distributed environments. This research evaluates the performance of the concurrent programming using the Actors Model in mobile devices called smartphones. Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica.

The recent boom {{in virtual}} reality is {{fostering}} {{the proliferation of}} gestural input devices such as the Razer Hydra, the Leap Motion 3 D Controller, and the Microsoft Kinect. This hinders the work of researchers and application developers, since they must write their programs using a diﬀerent API for each device. The main goal {{of this research was}} to deﬁne and implement a language for the representation and interpretation of bidimensional and tridimensional gestures. Through it, developers {{will be able to use}} the language to deﬁne gestures to be detected regardless of the device or the underlying APIs. We investigated diﬀerent ways of representing and recognizing gestures, and then created LaGeR — Language for Gesture Representation. In order to test its feasibility, we wrote a set of software tools and libraries for converting sensor movements into LaGeR strings, recognizing them as gestures, visualizing them, and notifying subscribed programs of their detection. We also created a test program that uses said framework to control the Google Chrome web browser through gestures. We tested the application with users and showed that LaGeR is a useful and eﬀective language for representing gestures and developing gesture-based applicationsInstituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica...|$|E

In {{recent years}} dynamic {{programming}} of networks has gained popularity, {{this is known}} as software defined networks. The communications protocol OpenFlow {{has become one of the}} most important amongst the software defined networks. Nowadays most of the OpenFlow configurations are made by applications, and these applications are manually created by manipulating rules that define network behavior. This can be an error prone process, causing unwanted interactions between the rules. Bifulco and Scheider (2013) proposed a formal definition for the interactions between rules and a detection algorithm, but stated that the algorithm was suited only for OpenFlow applications with just a few hundred of rules or during development. This work presents an improvement of the interactions detection algorithm performance, using well-known data structures to reduce the amount of required operations and a lazy comparison between rules (analogous to lazy initialization). The experiments shown the achieved improvement depends on the composition of the rule set, but the overall improvement was of 41 %, and it was determined that the changes in the algorithm represent an alternative approach that suggests the utilization of the algorithm inside an OpenFlow switch and not just for small applications or during development as originally conceived.

Bioinformatics {{algorithms}} {{are limited}} by memory and disc management processes due to their large amount of data manipulation, like sequence alignment methods. For example, NeedlemanWunsch algorithm aligns two sequences optimally; it creates a matrix of N rows and M columns, where N and M are the amount of characters each sequence had. Based on the final size of the matrix these problems become restrictive. This thesis’s objective is to set and prove a Needleman-Wunsch algorithm improvement {{in order to enhance}} its efficiency. With the fusion of two dynamic programming algorithms and the minimization on the similarity matrix usage the amount of disc and / or memory used by the algorithm will be reduced. The implemented solution is a modification of the K-Band algorithm, which gets the optimal solution parsing the matrix once, differing from its original version that parses it many times. The main feature of the new algorithm is how the band is expanded when the alignment cannot be optimal, that will happen when the parsing is in the border of the band. Some experiments were developed and ran in order to validate the solution created. With the results obtained, it was proved that the proposed improvement of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm uses the similarity matrix less and improves the memory and disc performance on big sequencesInstituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica...|$|E
