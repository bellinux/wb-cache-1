40|$|Value clarification: A Trojan {{horse in}} South African schools? This article entails an {{analysis}} of and a critical reflection on the value <b>clarification</b> <b>approach</b> to value-education. Questions {{that need to be}} answered are inter alia: Is value clarification perhaps an approach that offers an answer to the problem of moral pluralism in South Africa? What are the potential dangers of this approach? The origins of this approach are traced back to humanism, humanistic education and the human potential movement. It is suggested that the value <b>clarification</b> <b>approach</b> can lead to moral subjectivism, problem- and process-centredness and an overemphasis of personal emotions. Potential dangers of this approach for South Africa, where a lack of common values exists, are also highlighted. These dangers include individualism, relativism, narcissism, an egocentric “me first” attitude and the overall unacceptability of value neutrality in an educational situation, {{as well as of the}} absence of virtues and character and lack of recognition of social and historical concience. From a Biblical-educational point of view the approach of value clarification is unacceptable because of its humanistic basis. This article contains a warning for parents and teachers not to accept the value <b>clarification</b> <b>approach</b> to moral education as an easy solution to the moral threat in South African schools, but rather to see it as a potentially dangerous approach that could in fact contribute to the moral decline and erosion of authentic values. </p...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 111 - 115) The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the relationship of an individual's valuing process to the following three experimental community educational programs: 1) a Values <b>Clarification</b> <b>Approach</b> adapted to drug subject matter, 2) a Values <b>Clarification</b> <b>Approach</b> only, and 3) drug content development only. The field experiment was designed to test the relationship of a combined program as well as the separate programs to the changing of an individual's valuing process. Five groups were utilized in the study. Three of the groups had experimental programs presented, whereas the other two groups were control groups (no programs). Analysis was conducted within each separate group between the pre, post and post-post questionnaires by using the t-test of significance between the means. Analysis of the data provided the following conclusions: 1) analysis of the data obtained from Group one (Values <b>Clarification</b> <b>Approach</b> adapted to drug subject matter) revealed a difference that was significant between the pre and post-post questionnaires; 2) no significance was found in the other test groups; and 3) due to the breakdown of comparability between test groups, no findings were revealed regarding the interaction of the test groups. On the basis of the findings it was recommended that: 1) investigative research should be conducted to clarify the relationship between an individual's need satisfaction level and the application of a Values Clarification Approach; 2) further research to test and document the validity of an instrument which measures one's valuing process is needed; and 3) it is feasible for ongoing community organizations to develop an individual's valuing process by employing an approach such as a Values <b>Clarification</b> <b>Approach.</b> As a result of this study, the author contends that the development of an individual's valuing process should be an integral part of the health education process in the control of disease and promotion of health. The health educator must be concerned with not only developing an individual's factual knowledge, but at the same time must be concerned with developing the individual's valuing process. The combination of the two increases the likelihood of overt demonstration of the desired behavior...|$|E
40|$|M. Ed. According to the media, the South African {{society is}} {{experiencing}} an alarming increase of crime-related incidents like dishonesty, violence and injustice {{which shows the}} decline of morality. Schools have their own problems which show lack of discipline and respect for authority particularly by the learners. These problems characterise society {{in a time when}} the existing government introduced a progressive approach to education. One characteristic of the progressive education regarding moral values education is the right of the learner to a personal choice in moral matters. In this study, the educational justification of a values <b>clarification</b> <b>approach</b> is questioned in view of existing theories concerning moral development, as well as Graves' theory of human beings' levels of existence. From the moral development theories used in this study it was pointed out that the development of morality is structured in sequential stages ranging from an amoral to an autonomously moral stage. The educational implications are that the education of moral values in schools should be structured along the stages of the child's moral development. Children therefore have to be taught the content of moral values before they can be left on their own to choose and judge for themselves in moral matters. As indicated in the study, moral rules are learned in the process of growing up. According to Graves' theory of levels of existence, human beings are centred at different levels of existence which are characterised by different motivations, behaviours and value systems in their lifespan. Graves states that the difference in levels of existence, particularly in diverse societies like South Africa, necessitates different management and education approaches congruent with each level of existence. Most people in South Africa, like in the rest of Africa, lead a traditionally oriented existence which is characterised by an autocratic management style. This makes the values <b>clarification</b> <b>approach</b> in South African schools not accountable as an educational moral approach. The values <b>clarification</b> <b>approach</b> could on the other hand be used at institutions of higher learning where the majority of learners are in the postconventional phase of moral development. This study's recommendations as based on the findings are the following: that universal moral values be inculcated in schools given the existing moral development theories. that the values <b>clarification</b> <b>approach</b> be used at institutions of higher learning given the moral development theories and Graves' levels of existence theory...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (D. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Education, 2001 Program {{development}} through program clarification is an emerging field for evaluators committed to developing responsive and clear program designs. In this study, {{the use of}} program <b>clarification</b> <b>approaches,</b> designed to assist implementation of a major policy change, was explored at a policy and service level of an organisation. A new service delivery program (SDP) {{was the focus of}} program clarification, which was conducted in two phases. In Phase I (policy level), the main aim was to make the essential features of the SDP explicit to those responsible for system level change. This was achieved through evaluability assessment, during which document analyses, 12 semi-structured interviews with senior managers, and a group interview with service site managers were conducted. This resulted {{in the development of a}} clear, policy level, program logic model. Phase I revealed a need for the policy level program to be translated at the service sites. Phase II (service level) was conducted to assist managers at one service site in the development of a SDP implementation and monitoring plan, through the use of program logic and participatory approaches. Reflective practice and a small-scale study conducted by the researcher revealed that the program <b>clarification</b> <b>approaches</b> were useful, especially at the service site level where a high degree of stakeholder participation was achieved. This study focused on one organisation and one service site, thus, its findings cannot be generalised. Nonetheless, this study is one of very few which has attempted to apply program clarification techniques at both system and delivery levels, and to link the findings at these levels.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{moral development}} {{as an integral}} part of the educational process and development of college students. The paper's first section places the concept of development within a network of meaning that indicates "ethical development " to be redundant; i. e., if something enhances development, it is ethical, and if it is ethical, it enhances development. The second section proposes hypotheses for using the cognitive-development framework to encourage morality in students; however, these hypotheses indicate the manner in which behavioral-reinforcement theories and value <b>clarification</b> <b>approaches</b> can be in unity with the cognitive-development approach, rather than opposed to, or separate from it.

40|$|Six {{different}} approaches to teaching values in the classroom are reviewed in this paper. Each approach is reviewed according to: (1) the rationale of the approach; (2) the process of valuing; (3) the teaching methods used to achieve the specific purpose to the approach; (4) an instructional mode or system of procedures used by teachers to actualize the approach; (5) {{the roles of the}} student and the teacher in each approach; and (6) characteristics of the teaching and learning materials. The rationale of the values inculcation approach is to instill certain desirable and prechosen values in students. The moral development-pproach is used primarily to stimulate students to advance their powers of moral reasoning through a series of increasingly advanced and complex stages. The analysis approach to values education rests on helping students develop logical thinking and using scientific inquiry procedures in solving value issues. The <b>clarification</b> <b>approach</b> is to help students clarify and actualize personal values.

40|$|BACKGROUND This {{research}} is part of a project on graduate employability commissioned by the Office for Learning and Teaching (OLT). While there is general consensus that educational institutions aim for their graduates to be highly employable, there is contention about how this can be done and how to determine whether it is achieved. PURPOSE This paper identifies aspects of engineering education and the engineering industry that may account for differences in employment outcomes relative to graduates in other disciplines and fields of study. It is intended that a wide range of fields of study and fields of practice can benefit from identifying dimensions that influence employability. In particular, gaps in understanding, priority and terminology between industry and academics have been sought out for <b>clarification.</b> <b>APPROACH</b> Data from annual surveys has been investigated to identify distinctive aspects of employment for engineering compared to other disciplines. Views of industry professionals on the employability of graduates were collected at an industry forum. The forum included representatives of a range of disciplines including civil engineering. Similarities and differences of the views of employers of engineers in comparison to disciplines other than engineering have been investigated. The results are considered in the context of other stakeholders including academics, students, and graduates. The data were analysed thematically with a qualitative phenomenological approach. Data emerging was grouped together in terms of generic skills, employability and strategies to develop learning outcomes in undergraduates...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{acceptance}} of best practice as a standard for quality health care delivery, {{the exact nature of}} what constitutes best practice does not share universal definition or application. The purpose of this dissertation is to propose an integrative conceptual representation of nursing best practice from the philosophical perspective of complexity science. A five-step concept <b>clarification</b> <b>approach</b> was used to identify the concept, systematize observations and descriptions, develop an operational definition, construct a model, and formulate hypotheses. An expert panel explored preliminary validity of the definition and model. Purposive recruitment of clinicians and scholars was conducted for expert panel membership. The expert panel rated the strength of the model dimensions of adequacy, representative-ness, consistency, clarity, simplicity, generalness, accessibility, importance, and relevance, as well as interest in development and application. Narrative data from open-ended questions was incorporated into model refinement. Clinician properties and context properties emerged as two principle domains of interdependent influence. Key dynamic processes included critical thinking by which clinicians operationalize properties into practice choices, and informative reflection by which the organization monitors and improves performance through information flow and learning. All aspects of the conceptual model, with the exception of consistency of relationships, were ultimately rated as strengths by the expert panel. Relationships among constructs were identified as complex, diverse, and difficult to isolate. Expert perception was that clinician and context properties most likely equally influence nursing best practice, but that context properties may have greater influence than clinician properties over time. This model incorporates a full range of interdependence across clinician and context domains of influence. This model requires further operationalization of constructs prior to formal validity testing. The application of complexity science introduces challenges to research and measurement in the study of complex adaptive systems. The model presented in this dissertation provides a perspective from which a better understanding of health care system interdependencies may arise...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Alcohol use/abuse {{among college}} {{students}} is a serious concern for higher education. Despite efforts {{to address this problem}} student use/abuse of alcohol continues. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine which of three alcohol education instructional approaches more significantly impacted students' attitudes regarding the acceptance of alcohol use/abuse. Three hypotheses were tested to determine the impact on students' knowledge about alcohol, attitudes toward the use/abuse of alcohol and the relationship between knowledge and attitude. A review of the literature found there were three instructional approaches most commonly used in college alcohol education programs: responsible drinking, values clarification and disease concept. Three alcohol education programs were developed, each with an identical information component, but with a different motivational component which focused on either responsible drinking, values clarification or disease concept. A sample of 543 first term, freshmen, residence hall students was drawn from three regional colleges in Southern Oregon and Northern California, resulting in 267 usable questionnaires. To measure student knowledge and attitudes an instrument consisting of demographic questions, questions from a portion of the Claydon College Drinking Questionnaire and the Torabi-Veenker Alcohol Attitude Scale was administered at the end of each program. A 3 by 3 by 2 randomized blocks design was used in this study. The dependent variable was "instructional approach". The two independent sequential blocking variables were "college" and "sex". Three professional alcohol and drug counselors were trained and presented a different alcohol education program at each college so a complete crossing over of the instructor influence among all treatment groups was attained. Analysis of variance determined that there was no significant difference among the three instructional approaches regarding students' knowledge about alcohol. Analysis of variance determined that there was a significant difference among the three instructional approaches regarding students' attitudes, with the values <b>clarification</b> <b>approach</b> resulting in significantly less accepting attitudes for women regarding alcohol use/abuse.

40|$|The article {{studies the}} {{increasing}} interest of contemporary researchers {{to the problems}} of life quality in Russia during the First World War. The life quality is considered as an integrated concept that includes human needs and the ability to satisfy them. The indicators of life quality include the conditions of work and rest, housing conditions, social security and guarantees, life safety, leisure time and the possibilities of its productive use, subjective feelings of comfort, stability and confidence in the future. According to the author, the transformation of Russian society in 1914 – 1917 was accompanied by a set of negative phenomena and processes related to life quality, such as the deepening of social stratification in terms of financial security, population health deterioration (working population, in particular), increasing disparities in gender and age structure of the population, a high level of regional differentiation of the life quality in Russia. During the war, these processes had been further intensified. The author comes to the following conclusions: the issue of life quality in Russia during the First World War remains controversial; the assessment of life quality in most cases is comparative in nature and varies considerably according to the set of criteria for determination of rating scales. Further development of the subject requires a multidisciplinary <b>approach,</b> <b>clarification</b> of the concepts and statistical indicators, the identification and introduction of additional historical facts into academic research. It is advisable to create an encyclopedia of the Great War, revealing different aspects of this phenomenon, including the dynamics of the life quality of the participating countries population...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Glioma is {{the most}} common primary {{malignant}} central nervous system tumor in adult, and is usually not curable in spite of various therapeutic <b>approaches.</b> <b>Clarification</b> of the oncogenic process in its early stage is important for the diagnosis and effective therapy. Methods In the present study, we used the serological identification of antigens by recombinant cDNA expression cloning (SEREX) to explore the subtle changes of the protein expression in low-grade glioma. The levels of serum autoantibodies to the SEREX-identified glioma-related antigens were analyzed by ELISA, and the epitope site was identified using deletion mutants and overlap peptide array. Changes in the serum autoantibody levels were examined in the rat glioma model using C 6 and 9 [*]L glioma cell lines. Results We identified 31 glioma-related antigens by SEREX. Among them, the serum level of autoantibody to src-homology 3 -domain GRB 2 -like 1 (SH 3 GL 1) was significantly higher in patients with low-grade glioma than healthy volunteers or high-grade gliomas. The 10 amino-acids at the C-terminal were identified as the epitope site by the overlap peptide array and the ELISA using deletion mutants. The tissue expression of SH 3 GL 1 protein increased in proportion to glioma progression. The rat glioma models confirmed the increase of anti-SH 3 GL 1 autoantibody level in the early stage and the suppression in the late stage. Conclusion SH 3 GL 1 may be involved in the oncogenic process of gliomas and effectively elicit an autologous antibody response in low-grade gliomas. The immunological reaction to SH 3 GL 1 would contribute to the establishment of a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target for gliomas. </p...|$|R
