40|$|Aflatoxins {{are very}} potent mycotoxins produce by molds. Molds are very common pre-harvest and post harvest {{contaminant}} of cereals/cereal products. Despite improved handling, processing and storage of cereals, aflatoxins still remain {{a major problem}} in the cereal processing industry causing both health hazards and economic losses. Therefore, some researchers have suggested that {{in order to avoid the}} toxicity, the levels of aflatoxins and similar toxic compounds in foodstuffs have to be monitored closely, and be kept under control continuously. Otherwise, related health effects like acute and chronic intoxications, and even deaths, will still be an issue. Therefore, in this research the microbial and total aflatoxins analysis of selected <b>cereal</b> <b>flours</b> processed and sold in Abakaliki metropolis was carried out. A total of four cereal samples (maize, millet, sorghum and wheat) were studied. The total aflatoxins were analyzed using highly sensitive competitive Enzyme Link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) reader. The cereal samples were also analyzed for total fungal count using digital colony counting machine (CCM China). The result showed that all the <b>cereal</b> <b>flours</b> (wheat, sorghum, millet and maize) analyzed were heavily contaminated with fungal cells. The flours also contain unacceptable levels of aflatoxins. The total aflatoxins were above the minimum acceptable limits (10 ppm) according to National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). The millet and sorghum have the highest fungal and total aflatoxins concentrations while the wheat flour has the lowest fungal and total aflatoxins concentrations. There were significant difference (p< 0. 05) among the total aflatoxins level of the different <b>cereal</b> <b>flours.</b> The research also revealed that flours have high moisture content. It is therefore recommended that a more improved process line be put in place to ensure that all <b>cereal</b> <b>flours</b> sold in Abakaliki are produced using Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) ...|$|R

40|$|Grain-induced asthma is a {{frequent}} occupational allergic disease mainly caused by inhalation of <b>cereal</b> <b>flour</b> or powder. The main professions affected are bakers, confectioners, pastry factory workers, millers, farmers, and cereal handlers. This disorder is usually due to an IgE-mediated allergic response to inhalation of <b>cereal</b> <b>flour</b> proteins. The major causative allergens of grain-related asthma are proteins derived from wheat, rye and barley flour, although baking additives, such as fungal Î±-amylase are also important. This review deals with the current {{diagnosis and treatment of}} grain-induced asthma, emphasizing the role of cereal allergens as molecular tools to enhance diagnosis and management of this disorder. Asthma-like symptoms caused by endotoxin exposure among grain workers are {{beyond the scope of this}} review. Progress is being made in the characterization of grain and bakery allergens, particularly cereal-derived allergens, as well as in the standardization of allergy tests. Salt-soluble proteins (albumins plus globulins), particularly members of the Î±-amylase/trypsin inhibitor family, thioredoxins, peroxidase, lipid transfer protein and other soluble enzymes show the strongest IgE reactivities in wheat flour. In addition, prolamins (not extractable by salt solutions) have also been claimed as potential allergens. However, the large variability of IgE-binding patterns of cereal proteins among patients with grain-induced asthma, together with the great differences in the concentrations of potential allergens observed in commercial cereal extracts used for diagnosis, highlight the necessity to standardize and improve the diagnostic tools. Removal from exposure to the offending agents is the cornerstone of the management of grain-induced asthma. The availability of purified allergens should be very helpful for a more refined diagnosis, and new immunomodulatory treatments, including allergen immunotherapy and biological drugs, should aid in the management of patients with this disorder...|$|E
