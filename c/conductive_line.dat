30|$|From Figure  4 c, a bending tester {{was used}} to study the dynamic fatigue of the PET-based {{conductive}} silver line. During the test, the <b>conductive</b> <b>line</b> makes a periodic bending movement from I to V, and every period needs 2 s. The details also {{can be seen from}} the set in Figure  3 b. It is very interesting to find that the resistivity of the conductive silver lines also increases with the increase of the bending angle. From I to III, the resistivity increases from 5.2 to 5.76 Ω. It can be explained that when bending, the silver thin film was stretched and became thin, especially on the top point of the <b>conductive</b> <b>line,</b> so the stack density and conductivity decreased. From III to V, the resistivity was back to 5.2 Ω, and after a periodic movement like this for 1, 000 times, the resistivity did not significantly increase due to the good ductility of the metal silver. Generally speaking, compared with other printing technologies, this method also shows good adhesion between the silver thin film and PET, showing good results.|$|E

One of these groundplanes can be continuous through the transition, but the other ends at the transition. There is a similar issue with the microstrip to CPW transition shown at C in the diagram.

The ink-jet process is frequently used for non-contact printing of various conductive inks. However, the ink-jet printing process is restricted by the viscosity of the ink, because the nozzle can become clogged by high-viscosity inks.
