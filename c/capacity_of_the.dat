5|$|After engagements at Pultusk and Toruń in 1703 Augustus {{was finally}} forced to abdicate the Polish throne in 1704, {{in favor of}} a monarch {{installed}} by the Swedes, Stanisław I Leszczyński. Charles and Leszczyński were supported by the Warsaw Confederation of Polish nobles. In opposition to these developments the Sandomierz Confederation was created by other nobles in support of Augustus. The latter could call on about 75% of the military <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish army. Some smaller engagements at Poznań, Lwów, Warsaw and Poniec followed in 1704 as a consequence of Augustus' attempts to retake the throne.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} two-track {{connection is}} planned between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue.

The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Bypass was built. Service from Queens via the 63rd Street Tunnel would allow for the full <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line south of 63rd Street to be used.

5|$|An {{area was}} set aside within {{the grounds for}} athletics, aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground.

5|$|Anfield {{was built}} in 1884 on land {{adjacent}} to Stanley Park. It was originally used by Everton before the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding. Left with an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. The <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stadium {{at the time was}} 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's first match at Anfield.|$|E

5|$|Breathing {{air supply}} can come {{directly}} from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.|$|E
5|$|Bruce also greatly {{strengthened}} {{the research and}} information-gathering <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive, and sought to make decisions and policy {{on the basis of}} the best available evidence and information. A record 22 Royal Commissions reported to the Bruce government, as well as scores of other inquiries and research projects undertaken by the Commonwealth in a wide range of areas, particularly on economic, industrial and agricultural matters. Recognising that investment in science was essential to expanding the opportunities for agricultural and economic development in Australia, Bruce established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), now known as the CSIRO. He established the Bureau of Economic Research in 1929 and for the first time economists were regularly employed to advise the government on what had been until then exclusively political issues. By the time he left office, he had put in place extensive structures to provide information to the prime minister and the executive branch on most major areas of policy, a major development in the professional <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian prime minister.|$|E
