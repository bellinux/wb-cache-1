She believed that <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse's</b> face, once completed, would increase the sculpture's draw as a tourist attraction, which would provide additional funding.

25|$|The {{monument}} {{has been}} the subject of controversy. In Ziółkowski's vision, the sculpted likeness of <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse</b> is dedicated to the spirit of <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse</b> and all Native Americans. It is well-known that <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse</b> did not want to be photographed during his lifetime and is reportedly buried in an undisclosed location. While Lakota chief Henry Standing Bear believed in the sincerity of the motives, many Native Americans still oppose the intended meaning of the memorial. Opponents of the monument have likened it to pollution and desecration of the landscape and environment of the Black Hills, and of the ideals of <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse</b> himself.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 5, 1877, <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse</b> and Lieutenant Lee, {{accompanied}} by Touch the Clouds {{as well as a}} number of Indian scouts, departed for Fort Robinson. Arriving that evening outside the adjutant's office, Lieutenant Lee was informed that he was to turn <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse</b> over to the Officer of the Day. Lee protested and hurried to Bradley's quarters to debate the issue, but without success. Bradley had received orders that <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse</b> was to be arrested and taken under the cover of darkness to Division Headquarters. Lee turned the Oglala war chief over to Captain James Kennington, in charge of the post guard, who accompanied <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse</b> to the post guardhouse. Once inside, <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse</b> struggled with the guard and Little Big Man and attempted to escape. Just outside the door, <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse</b> was stabbed with a bayonet by one of the members of the guard. He was taken to the adjutant's office, where he was tended by the assistant post surgeon at the post, Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy, and died late that night.|$|E

50|$|Ruth Ziolkowski oversaw {{all work}} on the {{sculpture}} from the 1980s until her death in 2014.

Ruth Ziolkowski reasoned that <b>Crazy</b> <b>Horse's</b> face would increase tourism and provide an increased source of income to continue craving the mountain. The face was completed in 1998. She sought to expand the 1,000-acre complex's public facilities and increase its outreach to the Native American community.
