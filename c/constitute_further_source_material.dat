40|$|Abstract Tagging is an ever-growing {{feature of}} online systems. As {{more and more}} content is tagged by users, the {{resulting}} ?folksonomies? grow and can become unwieldy. The design of tagging systems {{must take into account}} how the resulting networks of tags are composed, and what motivated the taggers, in order to best use those tags as an aid toward search on the system. A literature review was carried out on the topics of folksonomies in general, how they compare with more formal ontologies and how folksonomies can be improved. Studies categorising folksonomy tags were analysed, with particular attention paid to those studies using the resulting categorisation information as a means to infer tagger motivation. A specific strand of the literature review focussed on studies of book-tagging systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} take a particular tagging system, the book website LibraryThing, and analyse the tags on fifty sample books. Long tail tags with a frequency of 2 or less, were ignored for reasons detailed in the research methodology, leaving a total of 13, 358 tags to be viewed and categorised. The tag frequency distribution was shown to demonstrate the Zipfian power law. The tag categorisation model indicated that booksonomy taggers generally tag within the categories of ?genre/style?, ?subject? and ?personal task-based?. Users are motivated mainly by their own personal organisational needs, but also by some social impulses towards the other users of the site. As a further component of the study, tags on two specific book genres (non-fiction and young adult) were analysed separately. Patterns such as higher-than-average tagging in the ?target reader? category on young adult books became apparent. The original research and datasets generated for this study provide <b>further</b> <b>source</b> <b>material</b> as a contribution to the evolving discussion on folksonomies in general, and on booksonomies in particular...|$|R
40|$|The turn of {{the century}} was {{accompanied}} by two historically significant phenomena. One was the emergence of computer networks as a vital component of advanced militaries and interdependent global economic systems. The second concerned China’s rise on the global stage through economic reforms that led to sustained growth and military modernization. At the same time, Chinese government policies and actions have drawn international criticisms including persistent allegations of online espionage, domestic Internet censorship, and an increased military capability, all of which utilize computer networks. These threat perceptions are heightened by a lack of transparency.

40|$|This thesis {{asks what}} the social {{responsibility}} of corporations {{is and what}} it means for corporations to be socially responsible. My hypothesis is that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is not the answer, although it is currently the central activity for promoting and maintaining the ideal. Historically, Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) was the first step in recognizing this necessity. This thesis aims to prove that social responsibility of corporations is assumed by healthy functioning SRI. It is important to understand that the legal obligation of corporations is to "maximize shareholder value" or to pursue profit. This obligation poses a potential conflict with their social responsibility. The problem is the misunderstanding that a company could fulfil its social responsibility through CSR activities. Since CSR is a voluntary activity {{on the part of the}} corporations, it has strong publicity implications and there are no third-party assessments to determine the quality or the standard of such activities. Furthermore, frequently CSR activities are social services unrelated to the negative impacts of the corporation's activities on society. The research method adopted is examination of the literature in the field and consideration of relevant case studies. In particular the recent nuclear power accident in Japan, provides a useful case study in the limited responsibility of shareholders and the legal obligation and social responsibility of corporations towards stakeholders. <b>Further</b> <b>source</b> <b>material</b> on the historical development of SRI and CSR is derived from an interview with a US research organization that works exclusively on SRI. Corporations cannot ignore social responsibility because there are social issues that must be addressed. As a result of their profit driven activities (which is their legal obligation), corporations accrue socially negative costs that must be recovered. Recovering such socially negative costs is considered the social responsibility of corporations. In order for corporations to pursue profit and assume social responsibility at the same time, SRI's assessment function must be restored in addition to the current CSR activities. Both functions are required to realize a sustainable society...|$|R
40|$|The aural {{experience}} of modernity has {{in large part}} remained {{in the shadow of}} visuality studies in scholarship on Austro-German urban culture of the early twentieth century. This dissertation argues that rapid and radical transformations in urban soundscapes {{at the turn of the}} century fostered a notable sonic sensibility among residents. City dwellers across classes, gender, and professions frequently commented on their acoustic environments, and intellectuals and artists found aesthetic and critical inspiration in myriad soundscapes. This study identifies the collaborative operas of Richard Strauss and Hugo von Hofmannsthal as a particularly rich and multi-faceted manifestation of this cultural-historical phenomenon, and examines a specifically modern sonic sensibility through their oeuvre. 	The dissertation argues that Strauss and Hofmannsthal engaged opera’s complex sound system to stage characteristically modern sounds and acoustic situations, to explore new modes of listening, and to reflect on the socio-political, cultural, and techno-scientific changes that the many novel sounds of modernity represented. Each chapter features a prominent sonic dimension: the homogeneous ambient sound of the city; urban noise; women’s heightened acoustic presence in public life; and new audio technologies. Analyses draw on opera’s musical, poetic, and dramatic material as well as on dramaturgic directions and the correspondence between the two artists. The literary and musical canon, and incidental commentary produced by contemporary political activists, music critics, journalists, and ordinary residents of Vienna, Munich, and Berlin provide <b>further</b> <b>source</b> <b>material.</b> 	Working with the score and libretto from their operas, and reading them against their cultural-historical backdrop, this dissertation contributes significantly to interdisciplinary scholarship in literary, musicological and sound studies. Hofmannsthal’s long-ignored libretti reveal how the poet saw a remedy to his Sprachskepsis (the insufficiency of language) in sound, and more specifically in the concept of tone (in poetry and the voice). The dissertation further presents a critical intervention in modernity studies by establishing the operas as a part of the modernist canon. Finally, this dissertation constructs a new story line of sound and listening in the history of German and Austrian modern culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} contains separate {{studies of}} the manuscripts, their orthographies, the rhymes, metre and treatment of <b>source</b> <b>material.</b> Both the orthographic studies and the rhyme—grammar reveal Athis to be a CG poem with no real evidence of Rhenish provenance. The metrical studies, dealing with vowel collision and units of one and three syllables, show how the Athis poet pursued various legitimate rhythmic options {{in his attempt to}} introduce variation to the tedium of regular alternation. The most positive results emerge from the comparison of Athis with its OF source, the Roman d'Athis. The dependence of the German text on the OF poem can be proved through misunderstandings of lines and part—lines of the Rd'A enshrined in proper names in the German text. By far {{the most important aspect of}} the German poet's adaptation is his sense of history. Ancient Rome and Athens are presented in an entirely different way in the German text.

By deconstructing the narrative on display in both pantheons this paper will argue that rather than exemplifying Britishness these memorials reflected the interests of the commissioning political elite. Desirous to defend itself against an emerging middle class that manifested itself with ever more fervency in the economic, political and no less cultural arena, Parliament resorted to a host of barriers that impeded popular access to the visual narrative. Through the eclectic selection of exemplary men, the monuments' sophisticated iconography and the reluctance to forge medial representations the Commons prevented its patriotism from appealing to the entire British nation in arms. Halfway through the Sattelzeit the supposedly 'national pantheon' was turned into a confined space for mediating an elite-based narrative of history...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: The post-polyketide synthase biosynthetic {{tailoring}} of polyene macrolides {{usually involves}} oxidations catalysed by cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (P 450 s). Although members from {{this class of}} enzymes are common in macrolide biosynthetic gene clusters, their specificities vary considerably toward the substrates utilised and {{the positions of the}} hydroxyl functions introduced. In addition, some of them may yield epoxide groups. Therefore, the identification of novel macrolide monooxygenases with activities toward alternative substrates, particularly epoxidases, is a fundamental aspect of the growing field of combinatorial biosynthesis. The specific alteration of these activities should <b>constitute</b> a <b>further</b> <b>source</b> of novel analogues. We investigated this possibility by directed inactivation of one of the P 450 s belonging to the biosynthetic gene cluster of an archetype polyene, pimaricin. Results: A recombinant mutant of the pimaricin-producing actinomycete Streptomyces natalensis produced a novel pimaricin derivative, 4, 5 -deepoxypimaricin, as a major product. This biologically active product resulted from the phage-mediated targeted disruption of the gene pimD, which encodes the cytochrome P 450 epoxidase that converts deepoxypimaricin into pimaricin. The 4, 5 -deepoxypimaricin has been identified by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance following high-performance liquid chromatography purification. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that PimD is the epoxidase responsible for the conversion of 4, 5 -deepoxypimaricin to pimaricin in S. natalensis. The metabolite accumulated by the recombinant mutant, in which the epoxidase has been knocked out, constitutes the first designer polyene obtained by targeted manipulation of a polyene biosynthetic gene cluster. This novel epoxidase could prove to be valuable for the introduction of epoxy substituents into designer macrolides...|$|R

40|$|Research {{evaluating}} perceptual {{responses to}} music has identified many structural features as correlates {{that might be}} incorporated in computer music systems for affectively charged algorithmic composition and/or expressive music performance. In order to investigate the possible integration of isolated musical features to such a system, a discrete feature known to correlate some with emotional responses – rhythmic density – was selected from a literature review and incorporated into a prototype system. This system produces variation in rhythm density via a transformative process. A stimulus set created using this system was then subjected to a perceptual evaluation. Pairwise comparisons were used to scale differences between 48 stimuli. Listener responses were analysed with Multidimensional scaling (MDS). The 2 -Dimensional solution was then rotated to place the stimuli with the largest range of variation across the horizontal plane. Stimuli with variation in rhythmic density were placed <b>further</b> from the <b>source</b> <b>material</b> than stimuli that were generated by random permutation.

40|$|Background: By {{previous}} studies {{it has been}} observed that patients with Tourette Syndrome (TS) present deficits in visual-motor integration, fine motor skill and spatial/motor ability. More recently, {{it has been suggested that}} fine motor skill deficits may be predictors of future tic severity and global psychosocial functioning in TS children. Objective: We hypothesized that deficits of motor coordination could be present in a large number of children with Tic Disorders (TD) and this could <b>constitute</b> a <b>further</b> <b>source</b> of social impairment. With this purpose, we performed a cross sectional evaluation of motor coordination and visual-motor integration in a large group of TD children. Methods: Our sample was constituted by 96 TD children (19 females, 77 males) with an age ranged between 4 and 13 years. 18 children presented a diagnosis of Transient Tics, 16 of Chronic Multiple Motor or Phonic Tics and 62 of Tourette Syndrome. Exclusion criteria were the presence of a diagnosis of mental retardation or autistic spectrum disorder; all patients were drug naive. Patients underwent a focused neuropsychological testing battery of Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC) and Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI). Results: We have observed, in a large part of our sample, difficulties in motor ability. 19 % of children obtained pathological scores (inferior to the 5 th percentile) on the total M-ABC and another 17 % achieved borderline scores (between the 5 th and 15 th percentile); the higher rate of impairment was found in the manual dexterity subtests (33 % had pathological scores and 22 % borderline scores). No association was found between the categorical M-ABC total scores (categorized as normal/borderline/pathologic, or grouping together borderline and pathologic) and TD diagnosis or tic severity measured by YGTSS. Children with higher YGTSS scores tended to show poorer performances in M-ABC, in particular on the manual dexterity sub-items, but the correlation did not reach a statistical significance. Conclusions: Our results confirmed the clinical impression that many children with TD are clumsy. In further study, two aspects deserve to be expanded, the developmental trajectories of children showing poor motor performance and the relationship of motor disabilities with other problems (ADHD, learning disabilities) that impair a large set of children affected by TD...|$|R
