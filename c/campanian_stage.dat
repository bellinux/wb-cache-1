5|$|Edmontosaurus is {{currently}} regarded as having two valid species: type species E. regalis, and E. annectens. E. regalis is known {{only from the}} Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, dating from the late <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage</b> of the late Cretaceous period. At least a dozen individuals are known, including seven skulls with associated postcrania, and five to seven other skulls. The species formerly known as Thespesius edmontoni or Anatosaurus edmontoni represents immature individuals.|$|E
5|$|All known {{specimens}} of Velociraptor mongoliensis {{were discovered in}} the Djadochta Formation (also spelled Djadokhta), in the Mongolian province of Ömnögovi. Species of Velociraptor have also been reported from the slightly younger Barun Goyot Formation of Mongolia, though these are indeterminate and may belong to a related genus instead. These geologic formations are estimated to {{date back to the}} <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage</b> (between 83 and 70million years ago) of the Late Cretaceous Epoch.|$|E

5|$|Argon-argon radiometric dating {{indicates}} that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.1 and 74.0million years ago, during the <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Late Cretaceous period. During the Late Cretaceous period, {{the site of the}} Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North America into two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world.|$|E
5|$|Deinosuchus {{was present}} {{on both sides}} of the Western Interior Seaway. Specimens have been {{described}} from 10 U.S. states: Utah, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, New Jersey, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and North Carolina. David Schwimmer has said Deinosuchus fossils have been found in South Carolina and Delaware as well, but none of them from those two states have been formally described. A Deinosuchus osteoderm from the San Carlos Formation was also reported in 2006, so the giant crocodilian's range may have included parts of northern Mexico. Deinosuchus fossils are most abundant in the Gulf Coastal Plain region of Georgia, near the Alabama border. All known specimens of Deinosuchus were found in rocks dated to the <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Late Cretaceous period. The oldest examples of this genus lived approximately 82 Ma, and the youngest lived around 73Ma.|$|E
5|$|The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) is {{an order}} of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles, known as crocodilians. They first {{appeared}} 83.5 million {{years ago in the}} Late Cretaceous period (<b>Campanian</b> <b>stage)</b> and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, crocodilians is a less ambiguous vernacular term for members of this group.|$|E
50|$|Pinacosaurus ("plank lizard") is a genus of {{medium-sized}} ankylosaur dinosaurs {{that lived}} {{from the late}} Santonian to the late <b>Campanian</b> <b>stages</b> of the late Cretaceous Period (roughly 80 - 75 million years ago), in Mongolia and China.|$|R
50|$|Anasazisaurus was {{discovered}} in the Farmington Member of the Kirtland Formation, {{which is one of}} the lower members. This formation dates from the late <b>Campanian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Late Cretaceous Period (73-74 million years ago), and is also the source of several other dinosaurs, like Bistahieversor, Kritosaurus, Naashoibitosaurus, Parasaurolophus, Pentaceratops, Nodocephalosaurus, Saurornitholestes, and Ziapelta.|$|R
50|$|Pteranodontids are {{primarily}} {{known from the}} Coniacian to <b>Campanian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Cretaceous in North America and Japan. However, potential Maastrichtian remains have been identified from several other locations, being actually rather common in the Maastrichtian of the Tethys Sea. Additionally, later phylogenetic studies imply that they represent a ghost lineage dating much earlier in the Cretaceous.|$|R
5|$|All known Daspletosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in {{formations}} dating to the middle to late <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Late Cretaceous Period, between 77 and 74 million years ago. Since the middle of the Cretaceous, North America had been divided in half by the Western Interior Seaway, with much of Montana and Alberta below the surface. However, the uplift of the Rocky Mountains in the Laramide Orogeny to the west, which began during the time of Daspletosaurus, forced the seaway to retreat eastwards and southwards. Rivers flowed down from the mountains and drained into the seaway, carrying sediment along with them that formed the Two Medicine Formation, the Judith River Group, and other sedimentary formations in the region. About 73 million years ago, the seaway began to advance westwards and northwards again, and the entire region was covered by the Bearpaw Sea, represented throughout the western United States and Canada by the massive Bearpaw Shale.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} of Daspletosaurus torosus (CMN 8506) is a partial skeleton including the skull, the shoulder, a forelimb, the pelvis, a femur {{and all of}} the vertebrae from the neck, torso and hip, as well as the first eleven tail vertebrae. It was discovered in 1921 near Steveville, Alberta, by Charles Mortram Sternberg, who thought it was a new species of Gorgosaurus. It was not until 1970 that the specimen was fully described by Dale Russell, who made it the type of a new genus, Daspletosaurus, from the Greek δασπλής (dasples, stem and connective vowel resulting in daspleto~) ("frightful") and σαυρος/sauros ("lizard"). The type species is Daspletosaurus torosus, the specific name torosus being Latin for 'muscular' or 'brawny'. Aside from the type, there is only one other well-known specimen, RTMP 2001.36.1, a relatively complete skeleton discovered in 2001. Both specimens were recovered from the Oldman Formation in the Judith River Group of Alberta. The Oldman Formation was deposited during the middle <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Late Cretaceous, from about 77 to 76 Ma (million years ago). A specimen from the younger Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta has been reassigned to Albertosaurus sarcophagus.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, Polish paleontologists Teresa Maryanska and Halszka Osmólska {{described}} a second species of Protoceratops, {{also from the}} <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage</b> of Mongolia, which they named P. kozlowskii. However, the fossils consisted of incomplete juvenile remains, and are now considered synonymous with Bagaceratops rozhdestvenskyi.|$|E
50|$|The Neuquén Group is a {{group of}} {{geologic}} formations found in Argentina. Rocks in the Neuquén Group fall within the Cenomanian to early <b>Campanian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Late Cretaceous Period, about 100 million to 80 million years in age. It overlies the older Lohan Cura Formation and is itself overlain by the younger Allen Formation of the Malargüe Group, separated from both by unconformities.|$|R
500|$|Gryposaurus (meaning [...] "hooked-nosed (Greek grypos) lizard"; {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{translated as}} [...] "griffin (Latin gryphus) lizard") was a genus of duckbilled dinosaur that lived about 83 to 74 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous (late Santonian to late <b>Campanian</b> <b>stages)</b> of North America.

25|$|Oviraptor {{lived in}} the late Cretaceous period, during the late <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage</b> about 75 million years ago; only one {{definitive}} specimen is known (with associated eggs), from the Djadokhta Formation of Mongolia, though a possible second specimen (also with eggs) comes from the northeast region of Inner Mongolia, China, in an area called Bayan Mandahu.|$|E
25|$|Oviraptor is a genus {{of small}} Mongolian {{theropod}} dinosaur that lived {{during the late}} <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage</b> about 75 million years ago.

This species of dinosaur was named and described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{a second}} valid species, P. hellenikorhinus, was named from the Bayan Mandahu Formation in Inner Mongolia, China and also {{dates from the}} <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Upper Cretaceous.

25|$|In 1923, the Third Asiatic Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led {{by chief}} {{paleontologist}} Walter W. Granger was hunting for dinosaur fossils in Mongolia. On April 25, assistant paleontologist George Olsen recovered the holotype (AMNH 6554), or name-bearing specimen, of Alectrosaurus, a nearly complete right hindlimb. This included the distal {{end of the}} right femur, the tibia, the fibula, the astragalus, the calcaneum, an incomplete right pes, three metatarsals of the left hind foot, two manual unguals, a manus, and the distal end of the pubis known as the pubic foot. On May 4, Olsen discovered AMNH 6368 approximately 30 meters away from his first find. This specimen included a right humerus, two incomplete manual digits, four fragmentary caudal vertebrae, and other poorly preserved material. These discoveries were made at the Iren Dabasu Formation {{in what is now}} the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Nei Mongol Zizhiqu) of the People's Republic of China.

25|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century many more ankylosaurid fossils were {{uncovered}} in North America. Some were referred to Euoplocephalus, others named as separate genera. In 1971 however, Walter Coombs submitted a dissertation containing a landmark re-appraisal of North American ankylosaurs. He noted that, among the many specimens similar to Euoplocephalus, their skulls varied so much that either every known specimen must be a new species, or they all represented individual variation within a single species: Euoplocephalus tutus. Starting from this assumption that there was only one species of ankylosaur during the <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Upper Cretaceous, Coombs synonymized the genera Anodontosaurus, Dyoplosaurus, and Scolosaurus with Euoplocephalus and the species A. lambei, D. acutosquameus, and S. cutleri with E. tutus, creating a species that spanned nearly ten million years, or the entire Campanian. The fossils now referred to this species contained more than forty individuals discovered in Alberta, Canada and Montana in the United States, which would have made Euoplocephalus the best known ankylosaurid. This included fifteen skulls, teeth, and a few almost-complete skeletons, found with the armor still attached. Individual armor plates are the most commonly found element from them. In 1978, Coombs even included the Asian ankylosaurid Tarchia in the genus, renaming it as Euoplocephalus giganteus.|$|E
25|$|Euoplocephalus, {{following}} the synonymizations proposed by Coombs (1971), {{was thought to}} exist for far longer, {{and was a member}} of more distinct faunas, than any of its contemporaries, as these fossils date to between 76.5 and 67million years ago, in the Campanian-Maastrichtian ages of the late Cretaceous period, and came from the Dinosaur Park and Horseshoe Canyon Formations of Alberta, Two Medicine Formation of Montana, and possibly from the Oldman Formation of Montana. Fossils that were initially believed to be from the Judith River Formation of Montana, are actually from the Dinosaur Park Formation. However, recent studies referred all Horseshoe Canyon Formation specimens to Anodontosaurus, and all Two Medicine Formation specimens to Oohkotokia. A specimen from the lowermost Dinosaur Park, or possibly from the underlying Oldman Formation, was reassigned back to Scolosaurus. Although the stratigraphic range of the holotype of Euoplocephalus is uncertain, all specimens that can be reliably referred to E. tutus came from the lower 40 m and the upper >10 m of the Dinosaur Park Formation. There are no known ankylosaurids from the top 20–25 m of the Formation. Thus, all Euoplocephalus specimens date to between 76.4 (or less) and 75.6million years ago, in the late <b>Campanian</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
