It is considered that the load (input disturbance) is unmeasurable, only its bounds corresponding to normal operation are known. To solve the fault detection problem, a detector was proposed for a class of linear control systems that can be implemented with low computational costs. The method is applicable for electro-hydrostatic actuators (EHA) with unknown load. The proposed fault detection approach is validated through simulations for jamming detection of aircraft <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> <b>driven</b> by EHA...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{possibility}} of raising the flutter speed of an aeroelastic system by feedback control. Emphasis is given to feedback control through a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> <b>driven</b> by a powered actuator. It is shown that only for certain aeroelastic systems is it possible to significantly raise the flutter speed by this type of feedback control. In addition, a second type of feedback control is considered, a jet reaction torquer acting on the wing itself. A marked increase in flutter speed is possible in essentially all aeroelastic systems with this form of control. Despite the fact that this type of controller requires more power than the <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> actuator, its use may be practical in many cases. The question of the reliability of the feedback control used to raise flutter speed is becoming less important in this era of missiles where the entire system is controlled by automatic devices. Part I discusses the basic problem. Parts II and III develop a general feedback theory. This theory, when applied to a specific aeroelastic system, permits ready determination of whether an increase in flutter speed is possible for that system. Parts IV and V consider numerical investigations of many systems using a <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> actuator. Analyses are made by both the general feedback theory and by analog computer, showing similar numerical results. Part VI considers the jet reaction torquer and the increase in flutter speed that it can achieve. Conclusions are presented in Part VII...|$|R

The paper describes the models of the electro-mechanical systems used for the flight control actuation of a regional aircraft, with the basic objective of evaluating the power requests that have to be fulfilled both continuously and completely for this safety-critical equipment.

Non- stationary speeds and loads in the course of <b>controlling</b> an aircraft <b>surface</b> make fault identification in EMAs difficult.

A relatively small EMA system is designed and built to allow for simple, quick, and repeatable component replacement. A simulated signal is developed to test four potential faults in the system. Classification is performed using an artificial neural network (ANN), which yields over 99 % accuracy. Indentation faults from moderate and heavy loads are seeded in thrust bearings, which are then tested to generate data. The ANN achieves 95 % classification accuracy in a two class scenario using healthy and moderately indented bearings.

40|$|The {{effects of}} active {{controls}} on flutter suppression and gust alleviation of the Arava twin turboprop STOL transport and the Westwind twinjet business transport are investigated. The active <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> are introduced in pairs which include, in any chosen wing strip, a 20 -percent chord leading-edge control and a 20 -percent chord trailing-edge <b>control.</b> Each <b>control</b> <b>surface</b> is <b>driven</b> {{by a combined}} linear-rotational sensor system located on the activated strip. The control law {{is based on the}} concept of aerodynamic energy and utilizes previously optimized control law parameters based on two-dimensional aerodynamic theory. The best locations of the activated system along the span of the wing are determined for bending-moment alleviation, reduction in fuselage accelerations, and flutter suppression. The effectiveness of the activated system over a wide range of maximum control deflections is also determined. Two control laws are investigated. The first control law utilizes both rigid-body and elastic contributions of the motion. The second control law employs primarily the elastic contribution of the wing and leads to large increases in the activated control effectiveness as compared with the basic control law. The results indicate that flutter speed can be significantly increased (over 70 percent increase) and that the bending moment due to gust loading can be almost totally eliminated by a control system of about 10 to 20 percent span with reasonable control-surface rotations...|$|R

40|$|Aircraft primary flight <b>control</b> <b>surfaces</b> are {{typically}} <b>driven</b> by two linear hydraulic actuators accepting the controlled flows from two independent hydraulic systems. When the actuators {{are part of}} a fly-by-wire system, actuators flows are controlled by valves, and a key issue is to ensure a pressure matching between the two actuators to prevent force fighting with a resulting loss of stiffness and dynamic performance. Different solutions have been used to minimize the pressure mismatch between two redundant electro hydraulic actuators, but limited use has been done of techniques based on generating compensation signals to reduce the difference between the pressure differentials of the two servo actuators. The advances in microprocessors computing power offer new possibilities that can be exploited to perform a good pressure matching between redundant actuators by using an appropriate control strategy without the need of a complex hydraulic design. This paper first presents a brief survey of the existing architectures of dual redundant electro hydraulic servo actuators, then describes a research activity performed on this subject. An optimal and robust equalization control strategy was devised, capable of minimizing the force fighting between servo actuators while using conventional electro hydraulic servo valves, thereby leading to appreciable weight and cost saving...|$|R
