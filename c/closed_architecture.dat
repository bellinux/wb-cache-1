25|$|Commodore had a {{reputation}} for announcing products that never appeared, so sought to quickly ship the C64. Production began in spring 1982 and volume shipments began in August. The C64 faced a wide range of competing home computers, but with a lower price and more flexible hardware, it quickly outsold many of its competitors. In the United States the greatest competitors were the Atari 8-bit 400, the Atari 800, and the AppleII. The Atari 400 and 800 had been designed to accommodate previously stringent FCC emissions requirements and so were expensive to manufacture. The latest revision in the aging Apple II line, the Apple IIe, had higher-resolution graphics modes than the C64. Though similar in specifications, the two computers represented differing design philosophies; as an open architecture system, upgrade capability for the Apple II was granted by internal expansion slots, whereas the C64's comparatively <b>closed</b> <b>architecture</b> had only a single external ROM cartridge port for bus expansion. However, the Apple II used its expansion slots for interfacing to common peripherals like disk drives, printers, and modems; the C64 had a variety of ports integrated into its motherboard which were used for these purposes, usually leaving the cartridge port free. Commodore's was not a completely closed system, however; the company had published detailed specifications for most of their models since the PET and VIC-20 days, and the C64 was no exception. Initial C64 sales were nonetheless relatively slow {{due to a lack of}} software, reliability issues with early production models, and a shortage of 1541 disk drives, which also suffered rather severe reliability issues. During 1983 however, a trickle of software turned into a flood and sales began rapidly climbing, especially with price cuts from $600 to just $300.|$|E

A place that, by adding levitated, articulated and colourful buildings, physically expresses the people-focused and socially responsible credentials of modern corporate tenants." [...] He has said that his design was intended to fragment {{the outline of the}} building to make it less imposing, and that the ceramic façades were inspired by the appearance of brick walls and the cases of guitars and drum kits in music shops in the vicinity. Explaining why he chose to make the building so colourful, he said: [...] "The colour idea came from observing the sudden surprise given by brilliant colours {{in that part of the}} city. Cities should not be boring or repetitive. One of the reasons cities are so beautiful and a great idea, is that they are full of surprises, the idea of colour represents a joyful surprise." [...] The decision to provide a publicly accessible central courtyard was made as a conscious repudiation of the <b>closed</b> <b>architecture</b> of the old St Giles Court, which Piano described as [...] "a kind of fortress." [...] He has said that the development's accessibility will make people warm to it: [...] "As soon as people understand they can cross through the central courtyard, their attitude towards it will change; they will cross because it's a shortcut and it is also nicer." ...|$|E

40|$|For many years, {{transitioning}} {{software from}} {{the research and development}} (R&D) community into operational systems has been challenging. Many of the issues are related to the differences between the research and operational infrastructures used. Historically, many R&D systems have implemented ad-hoc interfaces between components, using a variety of techniques that were frequently based on ease of use or programmer familiarity. At {{the other end of the}} spectrum, many large deployed operational systems have <b>closed</b> <b>architectures</b> with limited accessibility and proprietary application programming interfaces (APIs). These systems are often referred to as “stove-piped, ” due to their inability to integrate with other systems. There are often detailed requirements associated with the procurement of these systems that drive them toward these <b>closed</b> <b>architectures.</b> With the emergence of service-oriented architectures (SOAs), a set of technologies is now available that provides scalability, robustness, and standardized interoperability.

They are mostly used for helicopter work but {{can also be used}} for camera car, crane, or suspended cable systems. The A-1 systems do not have steerability of the roll (dutch) axis, only horizon leveling. These systems as well as the (A), will eliminate almost all of the angular disturbances. The drawback is that the (A-1) systems are <b>closed</b> <b>architecture</b> systems.

5000|$|Open {{architecture}} {{is a type}} of computer architecture or software architecture that is designed to make adding, upgrading and swapping components easy.

The first part took place in exhibition space TENT. in Rotterdam, during the municipal elections of 2010, in which he showed the artworks of all parties involved in the elections. The second part {{took place in the}} Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven, the Netherlands and existed of artworks that were selected by the liberal People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (Volkspartij voor Vrijheid en Democratie, VVD) and the far-right Party for Freedom (Partij voor de Vrijheid, PVV) in their so-called ‘Freethinkers’ Space’: and exhibition space that the parties opened in Dutch parliament for artists that had dealt with religious (Islamic) censorship. The third part opened in Extra City in Antwerp, and continued {{in the form of a}} theater piece in Frascati in Amsterdam. Central in the project is a thesis entitled <b>Closed</b> <b>Architecture</b> (2004) written by the far-right MP Fleur Agema, number two on the list of the Dutch Freedom Party (Partij voor de Vrijheid, PVV). The thesis comprises a sketch for a new prison model, which Agema has developed during her master's degree in Interior Design. In the project Staal expanded Agema’s sketches into a fully developed model. Moreover, it investigates the extent to which her earlier architectural work is the blueprint from which she now exerts an influence on current government policies, and hence the organization of our present society. The fourth part took place in the Van Abbemuseum in Eindhoven and in art space De Appel in Amsterdam as a result of an open call made by Rogier Verkroost, politician for the social-liberal Democrats 66 party, and GreenLeft politician Jesse Klaver to immediately re-open the Freethinkers’ Space that had been closed in 2011 by the liberal VVD and extreme-right PVV. The creation of these new Freethinker’s spaces was supported by Staal and the museum. Verkroost’s and Klaver’s Freethinkers‘ Spaces opened in September 2012, followed in Amsterdam by a Freethinkers’ Space curated by Carolien Gehrels, alderman for arts and culture for the Labour Party in Amsterdam.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transition}} from a PC-compatible market being driven by IBM to one driven primarily by a broader market began to become clear in 1986 and 1987; in 1986, the 32-bit Intel 80386 microprocessor was released, and the first '386-based PC-compatible was the Compaq Deskpro 386. IBM's response came nearly a year later with the initial release of the IBM Personal System/2 series of computers, which had a <b>closed</b> <b>architecture</b> and were {{a significant departure from}} the emerging [...] "standard PC". These models were largely unsuccessful, and the PC Clone style machines outpaced sales of all other machines through the rest of this period. Toward the end of the 1980s PC XT clones began to take over the home computer market segment from the specialty manufacturers such as Commodore International and Atari that had previously dominated. These systems typically sold for just under the [...] "magic" [...] $1000 price point (typically $999) and were sold via mail order rather than a traditional dealer network. This price was achieved by using the older 8/16 bit technology, such as the 8088 CPU, instead of the 32-bits of the latest Intel CPUs.

By the late 1980s, the only major competitor to Windows with more than a few percentage points of market share was Apple Inc.'s Macintosh.

By the mid-1990s the Mac's market share had dwindled to around 5% and introducing a new rival operating system had become too risky a commercial venture. Experience had shown that even if an operating system was technically superior to Windows, it would be a failure in the market and fall victim to Microsoft's illegal tactics (BeOS and OS/2 for example). In 1989 Steve Jobs said of his new NeXT system, [...] "It will either be the last new hardware platform to succeed, or the first to fail."
