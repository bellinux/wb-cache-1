40|$|A cost {{effective}} {{alternative to the}} existing treatment steps of the refining by-ptoducts, is the “on site” energetical valorization through 2 comparable technologies: thermal oxidation and anaerobic digestion <b>combined</b> with <b>boiler.</b> In a thermal multifluid oxidizer Cinclus®, the mixture is injected with atomisation and combustion air at high velocity into the oxidation chamber. The jet creates a local under-pressure and thus an internal recirculation in the oxidation chamber.

To prevent persistent boiler fouling, the gases are cooled to below 750 °C in the gas conditioning chamber by mixing the hot gases with recycled gases taken from behind the de-dusting device. Divert investment for fossil fuel boiler and soap stock splitting to install Cinclus soap stock boiler will allow: no acid waste water, no interphase, no sulfuric acid consumption, no fossil fuel consumption.

40|$|Combined {{heat and}} power (CHP) and {{district}} heating (DH) promotion policies {{are based on}} the assumption of high energy efficiencies. In the last two decades, however, there has been a big increase in energy efficiencies of combined-cycle gas power plants (CCs) including CHPs and gas-condensing boilers. This study tries to verify the validity of the assumption of high energy efficiency of DH. The experience in the agglomeration of Seoul shows that DH in combination with large modern CHPs is not more energy efficient but substantially more expensive compared to individual gas heating by efficient condensing boilers in combination with CCs. We argue that the Korean government should review its CHP/DH support programs and abandon the so-called heat supply monopoly for DH operators in newly developed residential areas. Such a policy intervention only distorts the space heating market and wastes valuable financial resources. Furthermore, the public should be properly informed on energy efficiency as well as energy- and system-related costs of various heat supply systems.

40|$|The first aim of {{this paper}} is to shed light on the {{thermodynamic}} reasons for the practical pursuit of low temperature operation by engineers involved in the design and the operation of combined heat and power (CHP) and district heating (DH) systems. The paper shows that the steam cycle of a combined heat and power generator is thermodynamically equivalent to a conventional steam cycle generator plus an additional virtual steam cycle heat pump. This apparently novel conceptualisation leads directly to (i) the observed sensitivity of coefficient of performance of CHP to supply and return temperatures in associated DH systems, and (ii) the conclusion that the performance of CHP will tend to be significantly higher than real heat pumps operating at similar temperatures. The second aim, which is pursued more qualitatively, is to show that the thermodynamic performance advantages of CHP are consistent with the goal of deep, long-term decarbonisation of industrialised economies. As an example, estimates are presented, which suggest that CHP based on combined-cycle gas turbines with carbon capture and storage has the potential to reduce the carbon intensity of delivered heat by a factor of ~ 30, compared with a base case of natural gas-fired condensing <b>boilers.</b> <b>Combined</b> heat and power Heat pumps Thermodynamics...|$|R

In the development into a low carbon city, DCS could replace the conventional air-conditioners as it is more energy-efficient and subsequently reduces carbon emission to the environment. This study aims to compare and evaluate on four different cooling systems that are suitable to be implemented in KL city. A case study is created where a cooling load of 250, 000 kWh/month of five office buildings in the same vicinity in KL city is to be met.
