25|$|The issuing of Hong Kong SAR {{passports}} {{began on}} 1 July 1997, following {{the transfer of}} sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China. PRC citizens who have right of abode in the HKSAR and who hold Hong Kong permanent resident identity cards, {{whether or not they}} are holders of British National (Overseas) passport or Hong Kong <b>Certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Identity</b> or other travel documents, are eligible to apply for the Hong Kong SAR passport. Note that acquisition of British citizenship in the British Nationality Selection Scheme itself does not affect the eligibility for a HKSAR passport. Nor does the holding of any foreign passport itself affect the eligibility for a HKSAR passport, provided that one remains a PRC citizen.|$|E
500|$|By 1925, Tschaikovsky had {{developed}} a tuberculous infection of her arm, and she {{was placed in a}} succession of hospitals for treatment. Sick and near death, she suffered significant loss of weight. She was visited by the Tsarina's groom of the chamber Alexei Volkov; Anastasia's tutor Pierre Gilliard; his wife, Shura, who had been Anastasia's nursemaid; and the Tsar's sister, Grand Duchess Olga. Although they expressed sympathy, if only for Tschaikovsky's illness, and made no immediate public declarations, eventually they all denied she was Anastasia. In March 1926, she convalesced in Lugano with Harriet von Rathlef at the expense of Grand Duchess Anastasia's great-uncle, Prince Valdemar of Denmark. Valdemar was willing to offer Tschaikovsky material assistance, through the Danish ambassador to Germany, Herluf Zahle, while her identity was investigated. To allow her to travel, the Berlin Aliens Office issued her with a temporary <b>certificate</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> as [...] "Anastasia Tschaikovsky", with Grand Duchess Anastasia's personal details. After a quarrel with Rathlef, Tschaikovsky was moved to the Stillachhaus Sanatorium at Oberstdorf in the Bavarian Alps in June 1926, and Rathlef returned to Berlin.|$|E

40|$|We {{identify}} {{a wide range}} of human memory phenomena as potential <b>certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>identity.</b> These "imprinting" behaviors are characterized by vast capacity for complex experiences, which can be recognized without apparent effort and yet cannot be transferred to others. They are suitable for use in near zero-knowledge protocols, which minimize the amount of secret information exposed to prying eyes while identifying an individual. We sketch several examples of such phenomena[1 - 3], and apply them in secure certification protocols.

40|$|The {{history of}} indentured Indians {{has been well}} {{documented}} in South African historiography in terms of migration and settlement. Shipping lists, which meticulously recorded the biographical details of each labourer, together with Indian immigrant reports, provide a wealth of information on the early migratory and labour experiences of indentured Indians. Regrettably, similar documentation regarding passenger or free Indian migration to Natal is absent in the South African archival records. This article adopts a biographical approach as a methodological tool to map the identification practices involved in the migration of passenger or free Indian immigrants to Natal between 1880 and 1930. Both the colonial and Union governments sought to regulate the entry of these immigrants through a system <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> documents. Passage tickets, domicile <b>certificates,</b> affidavits, <b>Certificates</b> <b>of</b> <b>Identity</b> and passports not only facilitated and hindered both individual and family migration, but also show how citizenship was defined, and migration controls were instituted and administered to free immigrants. Thus, as British subjects, free Indian immigrants were not really free but had to constantly, defend and reclaim their civic rights, and attest and verify their identity as the colonial and later the Union government sought new and creative ways to restrict and prohibit their entry. This article illustrates the usefulness of a biographical approach to migration studies, in not only highlighting individual but collective immigrant experiences, which provide a way of capturing the diversity, complexity and the transformational nature of free Indian migration to Natal...|$|R
