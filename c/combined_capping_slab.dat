Transversal grade {{of the deck}} is constant and equal to 2.5%, while elevation grade of the bridge is constant at 0.835%, sloping down towards Oštrovica. The bridge is a box girder structure supporting the deck across 10 spans: 42.63 m + 8 x 50.16 m + 42.63 m. Since the elevation of the bridge lies 41 m above the average water level of Lake Bajer, incremental launching of the bridge was executed without use of any auxiliary piers. The main longitudinal girders comprise box cross-section and were divided in 19 sections each (2 x 27.94 m + 15 x 25.08 m + 2 x 27.94 m). Piers of the bridge comprise a 6.6 m by 3.1 m box cross-section with 30 cm thick walls. Bridge abutments and shore piers have shallow foundations, while those piers located within the lake have foundations executed on groups of six piles each. The piles are circular in cross section, 1.5 m in diameter, and are connected with beam <b>cap</b> <b>slabs</b> measuring 8.5 m x 9.5 m x 2.5 m.|$|R

Objective: In this study we assessed the impact of O 3 and particulate matter exposure on HRV in humans. Met h o d s: In a crossover design, 50 subjects (19 ‒ 48 years of age) were randomized to 2 -hr controlled exposures to filtered air (FA), concentrated ambient particles (CAPs), O 3, or <b>combined</b> <b>CAPs</b> and ozone (CAPs + O 3). The primary end point was change in HRV between the start and end of exposure. Secondary analyses included blood pressure (BP) responses, and effect modification by asthmatic status. Res u l t s: Achieved mean CAPs and O 3 exposure concentrations were 121. 6 ± 48. 0 µg/m 3 and 113. 9 ± 6. 6 ppb, respectively. In a categorical analysis, exposure had no consistent effect on HRV indices.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{develop a}} rapid latex {{agglutination}} screening test for invasive amoebiasis. METHODS [...] The performance of an in-house {{latex agglutination test}} was compared with three standard serological techniques [...] the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), the indirect haemagglutination test (IHA), and the cellulose acetate precipitin (CAP) test. Forty six sera were screened; 12 from negative controls; 10 sera from infections other than amoebiasis, and 24 sera from patients with luminal or extraluminal infection with Entamoeba histolytica. RESULTS [...] Strong positive latex agglutination reactions were observed, with 12 of 12 sera giving <b>combined</b> <b>CAP</b> positive, IFAT positive, and IHA positive results. These results are indicative of invasive amoebiasis. Twelve CAP negative, IFAT positive sera, and 10 of 12 IHA negative gave weak or negative agglutination reactions. One of 12 CAP negative, IFAT positive, and IHA positive sera gave a strong positive latex agglutination result; one with CAP negative, IFAT positive, and IHA positive sera gave a weak latex agglutination reaction. These results correlate with either treated amoebiasis or with {{the early stages of}} invasive amoebiasis for which the CAP test is known to have a lower sensitivity than the IFAT, but a higher specificity. No reactions were observed with 12 out of 12 CAP negative, IFAT negative, and IHA negative control sera and all 10 sera from other infections (two giardiasis, three schistosomiasis, three malaria, one filariasis). CONCLUSIONS [...] The latex agglutination test was a useful indicator test, paralleling the results obtained with standard serological techniques.

40|$|The aim was {{to study}} the {{characteristics}} of mental status of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (<b>CAP),</b> <b>combined</b> with a chronic pathology of the hepatobiliary system of non-viral genesis.

All patients were divided into two representative groups: I group (68 patients) – CAP was comorbid with hepatic steatosis (HS), II group (96 patients) with absence of chronic liver disease. To evaluate the psychological profile of patients’ personality we used a standardized multivariate method of personality research and to evaluate the level of anxiety and depression the scale of Spielberger-Hanin test and Beck’s questionnaire were used. Results of the study revealed that 66. 2 % of patients with CAP, comorbid with HS, declared the formation of psycho-emotional disorders in the form of neurotic reactions to the disease with prevalence of hypochondria, depression, hysterical manifestations with high psychasthenia, trait anxiety and somatic reactions with prevalence of anxiety and emotional instability, lots of somatic complaints, fixation on their own condition with formation of distinctive thinking mode and behavior by the type of "flight into disease".

40|$|Parc mine {{in north}} Wales was {{abandoned}} after closure in 1963 and spoil heaps {{were left to}} erode into the Nant Gwydyr and Conwy River. A storm event in 1964 caused the west slope of the tailings dam to collapse into the river, polluting 11 ?ha of farmland with lead and zinc. Reclamation work commenced in 1978 and involved reshaping the tailings pile and capping the north and central sections of the site with limestone quarry waste. The north section was also sown with metal-tolerant vegetation (Festuca rubra, Argostis tenuis and Trifolium repens). The aim {{of the study was}} to understand how different reclamation surfaces affected soil chemistry using GIS. The uncapped south section, whilst having the most heavily polluted soil (74 ?mg/kg As, 24, 000 ?mg/kg Pb, and 19, 000 ?mg/kg Zn), supported the establishment of patchy but diverse metal-tolerant vegetation (Alnus incana, Fagus sylvatica, Ulex, Sorbus aucuparia). The capped north section had the least polluted soil (19 ?mg/kg As, 478 ?mg/kg Pb, and 1400 ?mg/kg Zn), densely vegetated with a nitrogen-fixing legume (Trifolium repens), and was able to support grazing animals, but remained visually incongruous and failed to support the re-establishment of native vegetation. The central section, which <b>combined</b> <b>capping</b> with native vegetation (Betula pubescens and Quercus petraea), was considered moderately polluted (26 ?mg/kg As, 3908 ?mg/kg Pb, and 9000 ?mg/kg Zn). Zinc was found to be the limiting contaminant for vegetation growth with soil concentrations exceeding 12 ? 000 ?mg/kg corresponding to areas of bare ground in the south and central sections. Barium was the only element to increase in the capped sections, indicating the limestone quarry waste used to cap the tailings was most likely barium-rich. Peer reviewe...|$|R
