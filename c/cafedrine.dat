50|$|<b>Cafedrine</b> (INN), {{also known}} as norephedrinoethyltheophylline, is a {{chemical}} linkage of norephedrine and theophylline and is a cardiac stimulant used to increase blood pressure in people with hypotension.|$|E
40|$|Background: Intraoperative {{hypotension}} is {{a common}} problem and direct or indirect sympathomimetic drugs are frequently needed to stabilize blood pressure. AkrinorTM consists of the direct and the indirect sympathomimetic noradrenaline and norephedrine. Both substances are covalently bound to the phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor theophylline, yielding theodrenaline and <b>cafedrine,</b> respectively. We investigated pharmacodynamic effects of AkrinorTM and its constituents on contractile force and tension in human atrial trabeculae and internal A. mammaria rings. Methods: Isometric contractions were measured in human atrial trabeculae at 1 Hz and 37 °C. CGP 20712 A and ICI 118, 551 were used to elaborate β 1 - and β 2 -adrenoceptor (AR) subtypes involved and phenoxybenzamine to estimate indirect sympathomimetic action. PDE-inhibition was measured as a potentiation of force increase upon direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin. Human A. mammaria preparations were used to estimate intrinsic vasoconstriction and impact on the noradrenaline-induced vasoconstriction. Results: Clinically relevant concentrations of AkrinorTM (4. 2 – 420 mg/l) robustly increased force in human atrial trabeculae (EC 50 41 ± 3 mg/l). This direct sympathomimetic action was mediated via β 1 -AR and the effect size was as large as with high concentrations of calcium. Only the highest and clinically irrelevant concentration of AkrinorTM increased the potency of forskolin to a minor extent. Norephedrine has lost its indirect sympathomimetic effect when bound to theophylline. Increasing concentrations of AkrinorTM (4. 2 – 168 mg/l) alone {{did not affect the}} tension of human A. mammaria interna rings, but shifted the noradrenaline curve rightward from -logEC 50 6. 18 ± 0. 08 to 5. 23 ± 0. 05 M. Conclusion: AkrinorTM increased cardiac contractile force by direct sympathomimetic actions and PDE inhibition, did not constrict A. mammaria preparations, but shifted the concentration-response curve to the right, compatible with an α-AR antagonistic effect or PDE inhibition. The pharmacodynamic profile and potency of AkrinorTM differs from noradrenaline and norephedrine in vitro. We anticipate metabolism of theodrenaline and <b>cafedrine</b> resulting in a different pharmacodynamic profile of AkrinorTMin vivo...|$|E
40|$|The {{action of}} {{theophylline}} derivatives (-) - 7 - 2 -(2 -hydroxy- 1 -methyl- 2 -phenyl-ethylamino) -ethyl-theophyl-line (<b>cafedrine)</b> and 7 - 2 - 2 - 3 -(3, 4 -dihydroxy-phenyl- 2 -hydroxy-ethylamino) -ethyl-theophylline (theodrenaline) on {{free fatty acid}} (FFA) levels in rat blood serum and on cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation and FFA mobilization in isolated fat cells has been studied and compared to the action of a noradrenaline plus aminophylline mixture (NAA). A significant in vivo increase of FFA appeared 15 min after NAT and 90 min after NET i. p. administration. NAA was active at both times. Unlike NET, NAT stimulated in vitro FFA mobilization and cAMP accumulation: NAA action was however stronger. NAT-mediated cAMP accumulation, but not that which was NAA-induced, was totally inhibited by timolol. Our results suggest {{the existence of a}} β-adrenergic mechanism for NAT and a tyramine mechanism for NET. A theophyllinic action does not seem to apply to either drug...|$|E
