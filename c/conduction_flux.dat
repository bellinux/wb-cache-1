When comparing with {{other regions of the}} heliosphere, the fast solar wind has the lowest density and the least frequent Coulomb collisions. This makes the fast wind an optimal testing ground for studies of collisionless kinetic processes associated with the dissipation of plasma turbulence. Data from the Helios and Ulysses plasma instruments were collected to determine mean radial trends in the temperatures and the electron heat <b>conduction</b> <b>flux</b> between 0. 29 and 5. 4 AU. The derived heating rates apply specifically for these mean plasma properties and not for the full range of measured values around the mean. We found that the protons receive about 60 % of the total plasma heating in the inner heliosphere, and that this fraction increases to approximately 80 % by the orbit of Jupiter. A major factor affecting the uncertainty in this fraction is the uncertainty in the measured radial gradient of the electron heat <b>conduction</b> <b>flux.</b> The empirically derived partitioning of heat between protons and electrons is in rough agreement with theoretical predictions from a model of linear Vlasov wave damping.

The resulting surface <b>conduction</b> <b>flux</b> then funnels a large upstream electro-osmotic convective counterion flux into the injecting hemisphere toward the zero-dimensional gate of the ejecting hemisphere to produce the superconcentration. As the concentrated counterion is ejected into the electroneutral bulk electrolyte, it attracts co-ions and produce a corresponding concentration of the co-ions.

Unlike its equatorial behavior, the high latitude plasmapause does not exhibit a significant afternoon bulge but instead remains at about L= 4 at all local times. This difference arises in part from the different physical processes at high and low altitudes and is complicated by (1) difficulties in selecting physically consistent definitions of the plasmapause location, and (2) imprecise models of the geomagnetic field above L= 4.

Application of this empirically derived index to a solar wind computer model is examined by comparing the MHD energy equation and the polytropic relation. The result is obtained that the polytropic index can replace the adiabatic index in the MHD energy equation to simulate the effects of heat conduction if the assumptions are made that the heat <b>conduction</b> <b>flux</b> has a specific form and the particle pressure has no explicit time dependence.

The results demonstrate that heat transfer by convection, radiation, and conduction in the air gaps between PV panels and the building envelope can be simulated in the EnergyPlus environment when these air gaps are in the “air conditioning zone. ” Nevertheless, in most cases, particularly on the rooftop, the air gaps between the PV panels and the building envelope cannot be set as the “air conditioning zone. ” Therefore, in this case, none of the EnergyPlus models are appropriate to simulate the effect that PV panels have on the rooftop temperature.

To date, most global climate models used to evaluate effects of land use/land cover change on climate do not include an urban parameterization. Here, the authors describe the formulation and evaluation of a parameterization of urban areas that is incorporated into the Community Land Model, the land surface component of the Community Climate System Model. The model {{is designed to be}} simple enough to be compatible with structural and computational constraints of a land surface model coupled to a global climate model yet complex enough to explore physically based processes known to be important in determining urban climatology. The city representation is based upon the “urban canyon” concept, which consists of roofs, sunlit and shaded walls, and canyon floor. The canyon floor is divided into pervious (e. g., residential lawns, parks) and impervious (e. g., roads, parking lots, sidewalks) fractions. Trapping of longwave radiation by canyon surfaces and solar radiation absorption and reflection is deter-mined by accounting for multiple reflections. Separate energy balances and surface temperatures are determined for each canyon facet. A one-dimensional heat conduction equation is solved numerically for a 10 -layer column to determine <b>conduction</b> <b>fluxes</b> into and out of canyon surfaces. Model performance is evaluated against measured fluxes and temperatures from two urban sites. Results indicate the model does a reasonable job of simulating the energy balance of cities. 1...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the American Institute of Physics via the DOI in this record. A {{partially}} built hard disk writer structure with a NiFe/CoFe/Ru/NiFe/CoFe synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) yoke was studied by time and vector resolved scanning Kerr microscopy. All three time dependent components of the magnetization were recorded simultaneously as a bipolar current pulse with 1 MHz repetition rate was delivered to the coil. The component of magnetization parallel to the symmetry axis of the yoke was compared at the pole and above a coil winding in the centre of the yoke. The two responses are in phase as the pulse rises, but the pole piece lags the yoke as the pulse falls. The Kerr signal is smaller within the yoke than within the confluence region during pulse cycling. This suggests funneling of flux into the confluence region. Dynamic images acquired at different time delays showed that the relaxation is faster in the centre of the yoke than in the confluence region, perhaps due to the different magnetic anisotropy in these regions. Although the SAF yoke is designed to support a single domain to aid <b>flux</b> <b>conduction,</b> no obvious <b>flux</b> beaming was observed, suggesting the presence of a more complicated domain structure.

In a fully ionised gas (V(sub en) much greater than V(sub ei)), when the mean free path for electron-electron (or electron-ion) collisions is much larger than the characteristic thermal scale length of the observed system, the conditions for applicability break down. In the case of the Venus ionosphere this breakdown is indicated for a large fraction of the electron temperature data from altitudes greater than 180 km, for electron densities less than 10 (exp 4) /cc cm. In a partially ionised gas such that V(sub en) much greater than V(sub ei) there is breakdown of the formula not only when the mean free path of electrons greatly exceeds the thermal scale length, but also when the gradient of neutral particle density exceeds the electron thermal gradient. It is shown that electron heat conduction may be neglected in estimating the temperature of joule heated electrons by observed strong 100 Hz electric fields when the <b>conduction</b> <b>flux</b> is limited by the saturation flux. The results of this paper support our earlier aeronomical arguments against the hypothesis of planetary scale whistlers for the 100 Hz electric field signal.

40|$|A {{solar flare}} is {{composed}} of impulsive energy release events by magnetic reconnection, which forms and heats flare loops. Recent studies have revealed a two-phase evolution pattern of UV 1600 Å emission {{at the feet of}} these loops: a rapid pulse lasting for a few seconds to a few minutes, followed by a gradual decay on timescales of a few tens of minutes. Multiple band EUV observations by AIA further reveal very similar signatures. These two phases represent different but related signatures of an impulsive energy release in the corona. The rapid pulse is an immediate response of the lower atmosphere to an intense thermal <b>conduction</b> <b>flux</b> resulting from the sudden heating of the corona to high temperatures (we rule out energetic particles {{due to a lack of}} significant hard X-ray emission). The gradual phase is associated with the cooling of hot plasma that has been evaporated into the corona. The observed footpoint emission is again powered by thermal conduction (and enthalpy), but now during a period when approximate steady state conditions are established in the loop. UV and EUV light curves of individual pixels may therefore be separated into contributions from two distinct physical mechanisms to shed light on the nature of energy transport in a flare.

This led Lallement et al (1986) to make a parametric study of solar wind acceleration, along the lines of earlier the Munro-Jackson study (1977), in which they concluded that uncertainties in the polar mass flux were large enough to be consistent with two extreme opposites: (1) a substantial energy supply beyond classical thermal conduction is required; or (2) classical thermal conduction is adequate to drive the flow. This ambiguity has been clarified by Ulysses observations of the polar outflow (Phillips et al, 1994). The polar mass flux density lies {{in the middle of the}} range studies by Lallement et al (1986), which suggests that extended heating is going on out to at least approximately 5 AU. Independent, purely energetic arguments can be made to estimate the required coronal source (electron) temperature that would be required to account for the observed energy flux density. An electron temperature of at least 2 x 10 (exp 6) K would be required for the classical <b>conduction</b> <b>flux</b> density to be comparable to the total energy flux density; such a high temperature is thought to be unlikely in a coronal hole. These arguments strongly suggest that some extended heating or momentum transfer mechanism is required to drive the solar wind from the polar coronal hole. A number of mechanisms are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{a series of studies}} have {{demonstrated}} the theoretical benefits of using laser ablation in order to mitigate the threat of a potential asteroid {{on a collision course with}} earth. Compared to other slow-push mitigation strategies, laser ablation allows for a significant reduction in fuel consumption since the ablated material is used as propellant. A precise modelling of the ablation process is however difficult due to the high variability in the physical parameters encountered among the different asteroids as well as the scarcity of experimental studies available in the literature. In this paper, we derive a new thermal model to simulate the efficiency of a laser-based detector. The useful material properties are first derived from thermochemical tables and equilibrium thermodynamic considerations. These properties are then injected in a 3 D axisymetrical thermal model developed in Matlab. A temperature-dependent <b>conduction</b> <b>flux</b> is imposed on the exterior boundary condition that takes into account the balance between the incident power and the power losses due to the vaporization process across the Knudsen layer and the radiations respectively.

40|$|The {{stationary}} upward {{propagation of}} a very lean methane/air flame in a long vertical tube open {{at the bottom and}} closed at the top is simulated numerically using a single overall chemical reaction to model combustion and assuming an optically thin gas and a transparent or non-reflecting tube wall to approximately account for radiation losses from CO 2 CO 2 and H 2 OH 2 O. Buoyancy plays a dominant role in the propagation of these flames and causes a large region of low velocity of the burnt gas relative to the flame to appear below the flame front when the equivalence ratio is decreased. The size of this region scales with the radius of the tube, and its presence enhances the effect of radiation losses, which would be otherwise negligible for a standard flammability tube, given the small concentration of radiating species. Heat conduction is found to be important in the low velocity region and to lead to a <b>conduction</b> <b>flux</b> from the flame to the burnt gas that causes extinction at the flame tip for a value of the equivalence ratio near the flammability limit experimentally measured in the standard tube. The effect of radiation losses decreases with the radius of the tube. Numerical results and order-of-magnitude estimates show that, in the absence of radiation, a very lean flame front fails to propagate only after recirculation of the burnt gas extends to its reaction region and drastically changes its structure. This condition is not realized for the standard flammability tube, but it seems to account for the flammability limit measured in a tube of about half the radius of the standard tube...|$|E

The semi-arid Central Andes are characterized by dry summers, with precipitation close to zero, low relative humidity and intense solar radiation. We show that katabatic forcing is dominant both on the glacier tongue and in the fore field, and that low humidity and absence of clouds cause strong radiative cooling of the glacier surface. Surface albedo is basically constant for snow and ice, because of the scarcity of solid precipitation. The energy balance of the glacier is simulated for a 2 -month period in austral summer using two models of different complexity, which differ in {{the inclusion of the}} heat <b>conduction</b> <b>flux</b> into the snowpack and in the parameterization of the incoming longwave radiation. Net shortwave radiation is the dominant component of the energy balance.

Correct modelling of incoming longwave radiation is crucial, and we suggest that parameterizations based on vapour pressure and air temperature should be used rather than on computed cloud amount. We also used an enhanced temperature-index model incorporating the shortwave radiation flux, which has two empirical parameters.

We present here self consistently combined Fokker-Planck modeling of particles and hydrodynamic simulation of flare plasma. Energetic electrons are modeled with the Stanford unified code of acceleration, transport, and radiation, while plasma is modeled with the Naval Research Laboratory flux tube code. We calculated the collisional heating rate {{directly from the}} particle transport code, which is more accurate than those in previous studies based on approximate analytical solutions. We repeated the simulation of Mariska et al. with an injection of power law, downward-beamed electrons using the new heating rate. For this case, a - 10 % difference was found from their old result. We also used a more realistic spectrum of injected electrons provided by the stochastic acceleration model, which has a smooth transition from a quasi-thermal background at low energies to a non thermal tail at high energies. The inclusion of low-energy electrons results in relatively more heating in the corona (versus chromosphere) and thus a larger downward heat <b>conduction</b> <b>flux.</b> The interplay of electron heating, conduction, and radiative loss leads to stronger chromospheric evaporation than obtained in previous studies, which had a deficit in low-energy electrons due to an arbitrarily assumed low-energy cutoff. The energy and spatial distributions of energetic electrons and bremsstrahlung photons bear signatures of the changing density distribution caused by chromospheric evaporation.

Some current generation LSMs use a simplified or composite canopy approach that generates recurrent errors in simulated soil temperature and turbulent fluxes. In response to these issues, {{a new version of}} the interactions between soil-biosphere-atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model has recently been developed that explicitly solves the transfer of energy and water from the upper canopy and the forest floor, which is characterized as a litter layer. The multi-energy balance (MEB) version of ISBA is first evaluated for three well-instrumented contrasting local-scale sites, and sensitivity tests are performed to explore the behavior of new model parameters. Second, ISBA-MEB is benchmarked against observations from 42 forested sites from the global micro-meteorological network (FLUXNET) for multiple annual cycles. It is shown that ISBA-MEB outperforms the composite version of ISBA in improving the representation of soil temperature, ground, sensible and, to a lesser extent, latent heat fluxes. Both versions of ISBA give comparable results in terms of simulated latent heat flux because of the similar formulations of the water uptake and the stomatal resistance. However, MEB produces a better agreement with the observations of sensible heat flux than the previous version of ISBA for 87. 5 &# 8239;% of the simulated years across the 42 forested FLUXNET sites. Most of this improvement arises owing to the improved simulation of the ground <b>conduction</b> <b>flux,</b> which is greatly improved using MEB, especially owing to the forest litter parameterization. It is also shown that certain processes are also modelled more realistically (such as the partitioning of evapotranspiration into transpiration and ground evaporation), even if certain statistical performances are neutral.

La presencia de esta región, donde el tiempo de residencia del gas caliente es muy alto, intensifica el efecto de las pérdidas de energía por radiación, que es despreciable para riquezas algo mayores porque la concentración de las especies radiantes (principalmente C 02 y H 20) es pequeña. Estas pérdidas enfrían el gas y dan lugar a un flujo de calor por conducción desde la llama al gas quemado, que es suficiente para causar la extinción de la llama por efectos térmicos para un valor de la riqueza próximo al medido experimentalmente en el tubo de inflamabilidad estándar. En el estudio numérico se ha modelado la combustión mediante una reacción global única, y se han tenido en cuenta las pérdidas por radiación debidas a las especies C 02 y H 20 admitiendo que el gas es ópticamente delgado y la pared del tubo es transparente y está fría. El efecto de la radiación es importante en el tubo de inflamabilidad estándar, de 51 mm de diámetro, pero disminuye con el diámetro del tubo. Los resultados numéricos y las estimaciones de órdenes de magnitud llevadas a cabo muestran que, en ausencia de radiación, la propagación de la llama sólo deja de ser posible para valores muy pequeños de la riqueza, para los que existe una zona de recirculación que contiene una parte de la región de reacción. En el estudio experimental se ha medido la velocidad de ascenso del frente de llama mediante una serie de fotodiodos equiespaciados a {{lo largo de}} la pared del tubo y por métodos fotográficos, y se ha usado un sistema de PIV para medir la velocidad del gas inducida por la llama en un plano vertical que contiene al eje del tubo. Se han usado partículas trazadoras micrométricas de alúmina, y se ha extraído de las imágenes de PIV el contorno de la región luminosa de la llama, supuesta axilsimétrica. Se ha propuesto un modelo unidimensional del flujo y la llama cerca del eje del tubo, basado en ecuaciones de conservación simplificadas, que permite calcular aproximadamente las distribuciones de temperatura y concentraciones de las especies a partir del perfil de velocidad medido. Se ha mostrado que las partículas trazadoras no siguen el movimiento del gas en el interior de la llama, {{debido a}} la fuerza de termoforesis que actúa sobre ellas en esta región, donde el gradiente de temperatura es muy intenso. Esto causa un error importante en las medidas de velocidad con PIV. Se ha propuesto un método iterativo de corrección de este error basado en el modelo unidimensional mencionado más arriba. El método se ha validado empleando imágenes de PIV sintéticas. [...] ABSTRACT [...] The stationary upward propagation of a very lean methane/air flame in a long vertical tube open {{at the bottom and}} closed at the top is investigated experimentally and numerically. On the numerical side, a single overall chemical reaction is used to model combustion, while radiation losses from CO 2 and H 2 O are approximately accounted for by assuming an optically thin gas bounded by a transparent or non-reflecting tube wall. Buoyancy plays a dominant role in the propagation of these flames and causes a large region of low velocity of the burnt gas relative to the flame to appear below the flame front when the equivalence ratio is decreased. The size of this region scales with the radius of the tube, and its presence enhances the effect of radiation losses, which would be otherwise negligible for a standard flammability tube, given the small concentration of radiating species. Heat conduction is found to be important in the low velocity region and to lead to a <b>conduction</b> <b>flux</b> from the flame to the burnt gas that causes extinction at the flame tip for a value of the equivalence ratio near the flammability limit experimentally measured in the standard tube. The effect of radiation losses decreases with the radius of the tube. Numerical results and order-of-magnitude estimates show that, in the absence of radiation, a very lean flame front fails to propagate only after recirculation of the burnt gas extends to its reaction region and drastically changes its structure. This condition is not realized for the standard flammability tube, but it seems to account for the flammability limit measured in a tube of about half the radius of the standard tube. On the experimental side, the velocity of the flame front has been measured with an array of photodiodes set along the tube wall and, independently, from photographic records. A PIV system triggered by a photodiode signal has been used to measure the velocity of the flow induced by the flame front in a vertical plane through the axis of the tube. Alumina particles are used to seed the gas. The contour of the luminous region of the flame front, assumed cylindrically symmetric, has been extracted from the recorded images. As expected, the shape and velocity of a very lean flame front, and the velocity of the fresh gas relative to the front, {{are similar to those of}} a bubble rising in the tube. The flow of the burnt gas features the region of low velocity (relative to the flame front) mentioned above which enhances radiation losses and seems to play an important role in the extinction of the flame at the flammability limit. This limit is found to depend very sensitively on the temperature of the tube wall. A simple model is proposed of the flow around the axis of the tube and the combustion around the tip of the flame front. This model uses the measured gas velocity at the axis of the tube together with simplified conservation equations to compute the temperature and species concentrations along the axis for a given kinetic scheme and radiation law. The results for a single overall Arrhenius reaction and for a four-step reduced scheme, both in an optically thin gas, are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data and shed some light on the roles played by radiation losses and kinetic effects on the flammability limit measured in the standard flammability tube. Namely, these results show that a conduction-radiation balance is approached in a region of low velocity that develops behind the flame front when the flammability limit is approached. Radiation losses from the combustion products in this region become then important and may cause the extinction of the flame. The thermophoretic drift of the seeding particles relative to the gas is shown to cause an error in the PIV measurements in the transport region of the flame, where the temperature gradient is large. An iterative correction of the measured velocity is proposed based on the quasiunidimensional model mentioned above, in which simplified energy and species conservation equations are used to compute an approximation to the profile of gas temperature across the flame in terms of the profile of gas velocity. The correction is tested using synthetic velocity fields and applied along the axis of the tube...|$|E
40|$|Many {{thermodynamic}} texts incorrectly {{imply that}} the entropy flux of thermal radiation (TR) {{is the same as}} that for heat <b>conduction,</b> the heat <b>flux</b> divided by the local temperature (q/T). However, for blackbody radiation (BR) emission a 4 / 3 factor occurs. BR represents the maximum entropy for all radiation with the same emission temperature, as well as all radiation with the same energy radiance. However, using Planck&rsquo;s formulas it is shown that BR emission has the lowest entropy-to-energy ratio, and thus the lowest entropy factor, for all radiation with the same emission temperature or radiation with an enclosed energy spectrum. In practice, analysis of radiative transfer includes incident, reflected and emitted fluxes. Case-specific integration, based on Planck&rsquo;s entropy formula, can be used to determine the net radiative entropy flux. However, this net entropy flux can be put in the form n(q/T), where n is a coefficient unique to the radiative fluxes involved. This allows the net entropy flux to be easily calculated given the energy flux and the temperature of the opaque absorbing material. This entropy coefficient can vary greatly, taking on values less than unity, and values greater than unity. This implies that the misuse of the heat <b>conduction</b> entropy <b>flux</b> expression can vary from overestimating (n &lt; 1) to underestimating (n &gt; 1) the net radiative entropy flux. Graphical tools and simplified approximate expressions are presented that allow the entropy coefficient n to be quickly determined in certain general scenarios of radiative transfer encountered in practice...|$|R
