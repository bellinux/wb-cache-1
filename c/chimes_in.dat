25|$|St Andrew's parish {{church is}} {{believed}} to have been built on the site of an Anglo Saxon church. Many features of the present church are Norman (with the chancel arch being completed in c.1120). There are a wide variety of features on the different facets of the church. The church spire was completed in 1633 although the 8 bells currently present were not added until 1734 and the back-lit clock and <b>chimes</b> <b>in</b> 1858. The organ has a case front dating from the 18th century. The church registers date from 1578. There was a Victorian era restoration of the interior of the church in 1875–1878 and again in the 1990s.|$|E

The track is [...] "delivered with sweetly juvenile expressions of desire, except that Tyler peppers the track with a single-word epithet that would earn him a kick in the groin from any self-respecting woman." [...] HipHopDX's Sean Ryon mused that [...] "even the more subdued songs like [...] "She" [...] with Frank Ocean" [...] embody [...] "Tyler’s middle-fingers-up attitude, as he twists perverted tales of stalking girls and “stabbing Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus” into anathematic odes to unbridled individualism." ...|$|E

Club and David Amidon of PopMatters noted that [...] "Love on Top" [...] features [...] "mature lyrics" [...] alongside Beyoncé [...] "sounding vocally giddy and aggressive while portraying the message."

The song's musicscape also features hand claps, a rhythm section, and [...] "cruises on an unconventional reedy rhythm and crackling beat", according to Chuck Cavalaris of The Knoxville News-Sentinel. The track is also considered a [...] "blues inflected track", and a dance jam. Kevin O'Hare of the Sunday Republican said the song is [...] "a Latin-flavored cut with a pronounced beat". Lisa Rose of The Star-Ledger commented that the song has a [...] "jazz-funk... embellished with a ground-rumbling beat and horn section solos."

500|$|Destiny's Child {{recorded}} R {{songs with}} styles that encompasses urban, contemporary, and dance-pop. In the group's original line-up, Knowles {{was the lead}} vocalist, Rowland was the second lead vocalist, Luckett was on soprano, and Roberson was on alto. Knowles remained as the lead vocalist in the group's final line-up as a trio, however, Rowland and Williams also took turns in singing lead {{for the majority of}} their songs. Destiny's Child cited R singer Janet Jackson as one of their influences. Ann Powers of The New York Times described Destiny's Child music as [...] "fresh and emotional... these ladies have the best mixes, the savviest samples and especially the most happening beats." [...] In the same publication, Jon Pareles noted that the sound that defines Destiny's Child, aside from Knowles' voice, [...] "is the way its melodies jump in and out of double-time. Above brittle, syncopated rhythm tracks, quickly articulated verses alternate with smoother choruses." [...] The group usually harmonize their vocals in their songs, especially on the ballads. In most instances of their songs, each member sings one verse and <b>chimes</b> <b>in</b> at the chorus. In their third album Survivor (2001), each member sings lead in the majority of the songs. Knowles said, [...] "...everybody {{is a part of the}} music... Everybody is singing lead on every song, and it's so great—because now Destiny's Child is at the point vocally and mentally that it should be at." [...] Knowles, however, completely led songs like [...] "Brown Eyes" [...] and [...] "Dangerously in Love". The group explored their lyrics to man-to-woman relationship, sisterhood and female empowerment anthems.|$|E

Lieberman released several campaign advertisements over the summer of 2006, seeking to connect himself to former President Bill Clinton and to portray Lamont as standing for little more than opposition to Lieberman. Lamont struck back against some of Lieberman's more negative ads with an advertisement produced by well-known political consultant Bill Hillsman. In Lamont's ad, a foreboding narrator says, [...] "Meet Ned Lamont. He can't make a decent cup of coffee, he's a bad karaoke singer, and he has a messy desk."

2500|$|Soon {{after his}} return to England, Dickens began work {{on the first of}} his Christmas stories, A Christmas Carol, written in 1843, which was {{followed}} by The <b>Chimes</b> <b>in</b> 1844 and The Cricket on the Hearth in 1845. Of these, A Christmas Carol was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America. The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School, caused Dickens to resolve to [...] "strike a sledge hammer blow" [...] for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book.
