5|$|When debates {{polarise}} between techniques, {{the methods}} are {{often referred to}} by a <b>colour</b> <b>code,</b> based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished. Green (Old World) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural context of what is a social practice. Brown (New World) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and {{have been described as}} 'cavalier' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis. Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.|$|E

Their International Daffodil Register is regularly updated with supplements available online and is searchable. The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth (the fifth was published in 2012). More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008, and the number has continued to grow. Registered daffodils are given a division number and <b>colour</b> <b>code</b> such as 5 W-W ("Thalia").

40|$|Subjects {{sought a}} unique target shape {{in a display}} of abstractor shapes under three <b>colour</b> <b>coding</b> {{condition}}s. In the no <b>colour</b> <b>coding</b> condition (NCC) all shapes shared the same colour. In the two colour-coded conditions, the target was uniquely and redundantly <b>colour</b> <b>coded</b> with a <b>colour</b> whose CIE xy chromaticity coordinates were linearly separable (LS) or were not linearly separable (NLS) from the set of distractor chromaticity coordinates. Performance was optimal under LS coding, was reduced under NLS coding and was least efficient in the NCC condition. We discuss {{the implications of these}} results for refining colour selection algorithms and for <b>colour</b> <b>coding</b> in situations where the gamut of available colours is limited. In a secondary set of analyses, we note large performance differences as a function of target shape. -l-Executive Summary The goal of this paper was to apply a recent finding from colour psychophysics to the issue of <b>colour</b> selection for <b>coding</b> in a complex visual display.

Much of the added material was linear, narrative prose, which is arguably easier to read than the disorganized first edition. Many chapters were renamed and rearranged in this edition, and the <b>colour</b> <b>code</b> from the first edition was removed.|$|E

The most notable change was in the engine, which was upgraded to the R32-N1 specification. Building on the 'Nismo' car's specification, it was also lightened by the removal of the ABS, and rear wiper, but for 'N1' the air conditioning, sound system, and boot carpet were also deleted, and distinctive light-weight headlights were fitted. 'N1' cars also had reinforcing for the brake master cylinder and additional brake cooling ducts under the car.
