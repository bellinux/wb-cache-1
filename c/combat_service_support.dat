5|$|Shoup {{favored a}} more frugal {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling the military was too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs. As the Kennedy administration brought more emphasis on conventional warfare, Shoup sought to use increased funds to improve military logistics. He is credited with formulating an entirely new system of financial management, supply, and inventory management. He also created a new Data Processing Division to centralize the data processing functions of several <b>combat</b> <b>service</b> <b>support</b> branches.|$|E
5|$|The Brigade was {{composed}} entirely of active duty senior noncommissioned officers and officers who conducted training assistance and valuations {{for a variety}} of combat arms, combat support and <b>combat</b> <b>service</b> <b>support</b> units. A new building was constructed on Fort Stewart, Georgia for the Brigade and was occupied in August 1997. The First United States Army, the Brigade's higher headquarters, also purchased new furniture and computers for the Brigade's use. In 1999, the brigade was again reflagged as the 4th Brigade, 87th Division.|$|E

5|$|The brigade {{consists}} of seven primary elements. The brigade's Headquarters and Headquarters Company, {{along with its}} Special Troops Battalion, provides support and oversight to the other six battalions in the brigade. The 1st Battalion, 306th Regiment trains primarily infantry units, while the 2nd Battalion, 306th Regiment trains field artillery units.

5|$|As {{part of the}} Plan Beersheba reorganisation, {{the unit}} {{has become one of}} three Armoured Cavalry Regiments (ACRs) {{assigned}} to the Army's multirole combat brigades in Brisbane, Darwin and Townsville. As an ACR, the unit is equipped with M1A1 tanks, ASLAV light armoured vehicles, and M113 armoured personnel carriers. Under the reforms announced in 2011 and confirmed in the 2013 Defence White Paper, the three Regular Army brigades will be restructured between 2014 and 2017 into three Combat Brigades with a similar structure and capabilities, each consisting of: a Brigade Headquarters, an Armoured Cavalry Regiment, two Standard Infantry Battalions, an Artillery Regiment, a Combat Engineer Regiment, a <b>Combat</b> <b>Service</b> <b>Support</b> Battalion and a Combat Signals Regiment. In 2015 it was reported that the Darwin-based elements of the 1st Armoured Regiment may be transferred to South Australia. In late 2015 one of the 1st Armoured Regiment's two tank squadrons was transferred to the Townsville-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment, with 14 of the tanks relocating.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, the {{division}} was reorganized. As {{part of an}} army wide initiative known as the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan, {{the division}}'s regiments were disbanded and replaced with larger and more versatile brigades. The 1st Brigade, 104th Division, activated at Vancouver Barracks, and the 2nd Brigade, 104th Division activated at Pasco, Washington. Meanwhile, the 3rd Brigade, 104th Division, {{as well as the}} 4th Brigade, 104th Division both activated at Fort Lawton, Washington. Each of these brigades carried the history of other historic units which fought under the 104th Infantry Division in World War II. The 104th Division was then assigned the mission of conducting One Station Unit Training, Basic Combat Training, Advanced Individual Training, and Combat Support training. 1st Brigade took on basic combat training, while 3rd Brigade undertook combat support training, 4th Brigade conducted <b>combat</b> <b>service</b> <b>support</b> training.|$|E

5|$|The {{structure}} of the reserve brigades is also being altered. The reserve artillery regiments will be re-equipped with mortars; the reserve Royal Australian Armoured Corps units will convert from light cavalry to producing crews for Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles, and a brigade operational supply company will be established {{within each of the}} <b>combat</b> <b>services</b> <b>support</b> battalions.|$|R

5|$|With the Reorganization Objective Army Division plan in 1968, the {{division}} {{ceased to be}} centered on regiments and instead was reorganized with brigades. However, with the 199th Infantry Brigade active as a separate brigade, {{the division}}'s new brigades were activated from units that had been under its command in World War II. The division's headquarters element (which had since {{been replaced by a}} Headquarters and Headquarters Company) was redesignated the 1st Brigade, 100th Division responsible for basic armor school training. The 928th Field Artillery Battalion became the 2nd Brigade, 100th Division responsible for armored cavalry unit training. The 325th Engineer Battalion became the 3rd Brigade, 100th Division responsible for combat support training, and the 800th Ordnance Battalion became the 4th Brigade, 100th Division, responsible for <b>combat</b> <b>service</b> <b>support</b> training.|$|E
5|$|A 300-strong Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) was {{subsequently}} deployed {{to support the}} Reconstruction Taskforce in April 2007, including a commando company group, elements of the SASR, and an integral <b>combat</b> <b>service</b> <b>support</b> team. In {{the latter part of}} 2008 the commando company conducted a disruption operation in Helmand province as part of Operation Eagle's Summit, which was a major coalition operation conducted in support of the transport and installation of an additional turbine for the Kajaki Dam hydroelectric facility. In March and April 2009, SOTG killed 80 Taliban fighters in a major four-week operation in Helmand Province, without suffering any casualties. Further operations undertaken include the Battle of Gizab in April 2010, and the Shah Wali Kot Offensive in June 2010, which resulted in heavy insurgent casualties. The bulk of SOTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in late 2013 as part of a drawdown of Australian forces, although some special forces remained after this date as part of the small Australian force maintained in the country. The Regiment lost 12 personnel killed while deployed to Afghanistan, along with one killed during a pre-deployment exercise.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} effect that combat exposure has on the divorce rate for military personnel. The thesis uses demographic data from the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) coupled with responses from the post-deployment health assessment (PDHA). The sample contains enlisted personnel from all four services who were married and deployed between 2001 and 2007. The probability of divorce after deployment was predicted using a probit model. Combat exposure {{is divided into two}} distinct categories, casualty experience and weapon usage. Casualty experience and weapon usage were used to create interaction terms with occupational specialties (<b>combat</b> arms, medical <b>service,</b> <b>combat</b> <b>service,</b> <b>service</b> <b>support)</b> and gender. Results indicate that in most cases, combat exposure will increase the likelihood of divorce. Additionally, a casualty experience tends to have a greater impact on divorce than does weapon usage. Specifically, weapon usage was found to increase the likelihood of divorce for personnel in the medical service (Navy) and <b>service</b> <b>support</b> (Army). A casualty experience increased the likelihood of divorce for personnel in combat arms (Marines, Army) and <b>service</b> <b>support</b> (Marines). Aside from combat exposure, the results indicate that divorce rates vary across occupational specialties and the likelihood of divorce is substantially higher for women.

50|$|When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, {{starting}} World War II, the U.S. Army {{was largely}} an infantry force with supporting artillery, engineers, and cavalry, {{as well as}} <b>combat</b> <b>support</b> and <b>combat</b> <b>service</b> <b>supporting</b> arms. It was far smaller than most European armies, and few units were motorized or mechanized. As war approached, {{there was a need}} to both modernize the force and to conduct large-scale maneuvers to test all aspects of a fast-growing, inexperienced force. General George C. Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, appointed General Leslie McNair as director of all army training. He and Colonel Mark Wayne Clark picked thousands of acres of unused land in Louisiana as a good place for large-scale training. The war games were conducted while the British awaited an expected German invasion of the United Kingdom, and some speculated that the National Guard units used in the maneuvers would not be demobilized afterwards.|$|R
