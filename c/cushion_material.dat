Abstract Wooden pallets are commonly dropped vertically and hit horizontally during distribution. To reduce the impact, it seems logical to place <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> on a pallet. In this study an anti-vibration pad was used in free-fall vertical drop tests and horizontal impact tests of softwood pallets. Results indicate that placing <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> on a pallet does in fact increase impact acceleration significantly due to the uneven surface of the top board of the pallet in the free-fall drop case and due to the additional friction force from the <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> in the horizontal impact case. Thus, placing <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> on wooden pallets is not recommended...|$|R

This research study investigated the use of novel energy absorbing cushion materials integrated into helicopter seats to mitigate the aircrew whole-body exposure to high vibration levels. Replacing the <b>cushion</b> <b>material</b> on a helicopter seat was a low cost solution with less certification effort that provided a reduction in the vibration transmitted to the aircrew. Novel energy absorbing <b>cushion</b> <b>material,</b> namely, the Hybrid Air Cushioning System known as Mitigator and a viscoelastic polyurethane material known as Sorbothane, were evaluated using flight tests on the NRC Bell- 412 helicopter. The test results confirmed that the aircrew vibration levels can be effectively reduced through proper optimization of the seat cushion impedance properties. In particular, integration of the Hybrid Air Cushioning System into the seat significantly reduced the 1 /rev peak while marginally reducing the 4 /rev peak that resulted in an overall reduction in the aircrew vibration.

50|$|The {{amount of}} shock {{transmitted}} {{by a particular}} <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> is largely dependent on {{the thickness of the}} cushion, the drop height, and the load-bearing area of the cushion (static loading). A cushion must deform under shock for it to function. If a product is on a large load-bearing area, the cushion may not deform and will not cushion the shock. If the load-bearing area is too small, the product may “bottom out” during a shock; the shock is not cushioned. Engineers use “cushion curves” to choose the best thickness and load-bearing area for a <b>cushioning</b> <b>material.</b> Often two to three inches (50 - 75 mm) of cushioning are needed to protect fragile items.|$|R

Therefore, we used expanded polyethylene and laminated-board <b>cushion</b> as test <b>materials</b> to represent typical <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials,</b> and proposed simplified performance evaluation methods based on certain dynamic compression tests.

For example, Hashish ([Hashish et al. 2003]) evaluated a polyimide foam as a fire barrier for spacecraft <b>cushion</b> <b>material.</b> When tested by cone calorimetry, the application of polyimide foam layers over standard PUF increased the minimum heat flux for ignition of flammable PUF from 27 [*]kW/m 2 to 48 [*]kW/m 2. This ignition risk reduction was sufficient to enable the noncompliant PUF to pass the targeted regulations. Inclusion of polyimide foam layers also significantly reduced the PHRR, mass loss rate (MLR), and the generation of smoke and carbon monoxide. Carboxylated chloroprene foams are also commonly used to encapsulate the PUF core or as a fabric backing. Chloroprene foams are high density foams which are generally specified for public transport applications. They generally act as active fire barrier materials.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Expansive clays suffer volume change due {{to changes}} in {{moisture}} content which causes heaving, cracking and {{the breakup of the}} road pavement. The main properties of the expansive soil that are to be improved are strength, volume stability and durability. Stabilization of a clayey sub-grade is necessary to improve its volume stability, increase its unconfined compressive strength and its soaked California Bearing Ratio (CBR), in order to improve the overall pavement performance. The use of industrial by-products for stabilizing expansive soils is gaining importance, because of the ecological and economic benefits derived there from. In the present study, expansive soil, stabilized with Ground Granulated Blast furnace Slag (GGBS), with and without lime was used as <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> above an expansive clay sub-grade to study its performance in improving the properties of the sub-grade. The investigations show that the GGBS-stabilized expansive soil, with and without lime, as a <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> is effective in reducing the heave of the underlying clay bed apart from improving the soaked CBR and increasing the unconfined compressive strength of the soil, GGBS mix system. The studies also indicate that the <b>cushioning</b> <b>material</b> possesses all the properties needed for use as sub-base <b>material.</b> So, the <b>cushion</b> also serves as a sub-base layer in the pavement structure. The use of GGBS-stabilized soil alone, or in combination with lime, has significant effect in improving the properties o...|$|R

The flat endothelium on the ventricular aspect and the cuboidal endothelium on the arterial aspect of the valves correlate, respectively, with expected high and low shear forces produced by surface blood flow. Development of an aorta and pulmonary trunk with tricuspid semilunar valves appears to be contingent on the appearance of separate entwined ventricular ejection streams.

30|$|Composite or {{laminated}} fabrics offer two advantages. First, they {{eliminate the}} labor involved in sequential upholstering of fabric layers, and second, they prevent exposure of underlying <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> by ‘crack-opening’. When the multi-layered barrier fabric {{is exposed to}} flames, the heat is taken away by the outer coating or layer of the composite fabric, leaving the underlying substrate to which the coating or outer layer is laminated intact and preventing the involvement of underlying <b>cushioning</b> <b>materials</b> in the fire. For example, when a glass fiber fabric coated with polyvinyl chloride is exposed to flames, the polymer does not shrink away from the underlying glass fiber fabric. Instead, it softens and flows into the interstices of the glass fiber fabric. Laminated/coated fabrics eliminate the air space between the layers of barrier fabric and maintain the aesthetics of the exterior fabric while still providing better fire performance ([Schumann & Hartzell 1989]; [Decabromodiphenylether 2005]).|$|R
