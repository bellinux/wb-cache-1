The compounds 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant {{components of the}} volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor. Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an efficiency {{comparable to that of}} the antibiotic ampicillin. These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C.tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. A 2009 study found L.perlatum puffballs to contain the phenolic compound <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> at a concentration of about 14milligrams per kilogram of mushroom.

25|$|The biosynthetic {{route of}} {{curcumin}} is uncertain. In 1973, Roughly and Whiting proposed two mechanisms for curcumin biosynthesis. The first mechanism involves a chain extension reaction by <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> and 5 malonyl-CoA molecules that eventually arylized into a curcuminoid. The second mechanism involves two cinnamate units coupled together by malonyl-CoA.

The basis for this synergism was studied by exposing asparagus seeds and radicles from pregerminated seeds to ferulic (FA), caffeic (CA), or methylenedioxycinnamic (MDA) acids alone and in combinations of two or three of these acids. After treatment, seeds were placed in pots of peat-lite mix, and, depending on the experiment, all or half were inoculated with F. oxysporum (Schlecht) f. sp. asparagi (Cohen).

25|$|European folk {{medicine}} didn't distinguish between various butterwort species, but prescribed them for sores, swelling, sciatica, and liver disease, {{as well as}} stomach aches, chest pain and respiratory problems.

25|$|The {{identification}} of suitable matrix compounds {{is determined to}} some extent by trial and error, but {{they are based on}} some specific molecular design considerations. They are of a fairly low molecular weight (to allow easy vaporization), but are large enough (with a low enough vapor pressure) not to evaporate during sample preparation or while standing in the mass spectrometer. They are often acidic, therefore act as a proton source to encourage ionization of the analyte. Basic matrices have also been reported. They have a strong optical absorption in either the UV or IR range, so that they rapidly and efficiently absorb the laser irradiation. This efficiency is commonly associated with chemical structures incorporating several conjugated double bonds, as seen in the structure of <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid.</b> They are functionalized with polar groups, allowing their use in aqueous solutions. They typically contain a chromophore.|$|E
50|$|His {{investigations}} in the aromatic series include isomerism of the <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids</b> and {{the synthesis of}} tyrosine from phenylalanine (1882). In 1875, by nitrating benzoic acid, Erlenmeyer disproved the prevalent opinion that more than three nitrobenzoic acids exist.|$|R

40|$|The {{membrane}} potentials of aged, excised barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) root {{cells were}} rapidly depolarized {{by the addition}} of salicylic acid (o-hydroxybenzoic acid) to the buffered medium bathing root segments. Initial values for membrane potentials were restored very slowly (within 100 minutes) by replacing the phenolic solution by phenolic-free buffer. Several other naturally occurring benzoic and <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids</b> depolarized cell membrane potentials. The <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids</b> consistently caused a greater depolarization than the correspondingly substituted benzoic acids. A strong positive correlation was found between the depolarization values (ΔE) for the benzoic acids and their lipid solubilities. This study supports the hypothesis that the inhibition of ion uptake brought about by naturally occurring phenolic acids is caused by a generalized increase in membrane permeability to inorganic ions...|$|R
25|$|William Perkin {{continued}} active {{research in}} organic chemistry {{for the rest}} of his life: he discovered and marketed other synthetic dyes, including Britannia Violet and Perkin's Green; he discovered ways to make coumarin, one of the first synthetic perfume raw materials, and <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid.</b> (The reaction used to make the latter became known as the Perkin reaction.) Local lore has it that the colour of the nearby Grand Union Canal changed from week to week depending on the activity at Perkin's Greenford dyeworks. In 1869, Perkin found a method for the commercial production from anthracene of the brilliant red dye alizarin, which had been isolated and identified from madder root some forty years earlier in 1826 by the French chemist Pierre Robiquet, simultaneously with purpurin, another red dye of lesser industrial interest, but the German chemical company BASF patented the same process one day before he did. During the next decade, the new German Empire was rapidly eclipsing Britain as the centre of Europe's chemical industry. By the 1890s, Germany had a near-monopoly on the business and Perkin was compelled to sell off his holdings and retire.|$|E
25|$|The term matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization (MALDI) {{was coined}} in 1985 by Franz Hillenkamp, Michael Karas and their colleagues. These {{researchers found that}} the amino acid alanine could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulsed 266nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the laser energy and helping to ionize the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide melittin could be ionized when mixed {{with this kind of}} “matrix”. The breakthrough for large molecule laser desorption ionization came in 1987 when Koichi Tanaka of Shimadzu Corporation and his co-workers used what they called the “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” that combined 30nm cobalt particles in glycerol with a 337nm nitrogen laser for ionization. Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able to ionize biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized. Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able to ionize the 67 kDa protein albumin using a nicotinic acid matrix and a 266nm laser. Further improvements were realized {{through the use of a}} 355nm laser and the <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acid</b> derivatives ferulic acid, caffeic acid and sinapinic acid as the matrix. The availability of small and relatively inexpensive nitrogen lasers operating at 337nm wavelength and the first commercial instruments introduced in the early 1990s brought MALDI to an increasing number of researchers. Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.|$|E

40|$|Two {{oxidation}} {{systems were}} examined for the oxidation of {{three groups of}} phenolic antioxidants; five <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids,</b> two benzoic acids, and two phenols characteristic of olive fruits. Periodate oxidation, which is reported to produce products similar to polyphenol oxidase, was contrasted with the reactivity of the Fenton system, an inorganic source of hydroxyl radicals. Reaction products were identified as various quinones, dimers, and aldehydes, but {{the nature of the}} products differed between the two oxidation systems. Structure-activity effects were also observed for the different phenols. All <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids</b> in this study reacted with the Fenton reagent to produce benzaldehydes as the main products, with the exception of 5 -caffeoylquinic acid. In contrast, periodate oxidation gave no reaction with some of the <b>cinnamic</b> <b>acids.</b> Quinone formation was observed for the two compounds, caffeic acid and 5 -caffeoylquinic acid, possessing o-hydroxy groups. Caffeic acid was unusual in that dimer formation was the main initial product of reaction. Benzoic acids were readily oxidized by both systems, but no identifiable products were isolated. Oleuropein was oxidized by both oxidants used in this study, resulting in quinones in each system, whereas little or no oxidation of tyrosol was observed. This highlights the importance of conjugation between the alkene double bond and the hydroxy group.
