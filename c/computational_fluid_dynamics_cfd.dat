40|$|Abstract: Structured packings, {{have found}} great {{applications}} in industries, because of lower pressure drop and higher capacity and efficiency {{in comparison with}} random packings and trays. Dry pressure drop {{is one of the}} most important parameters in design of structured packed columns. Type of packing and geometrical characteristics such as specific surface area, dimensions and angle of channels and porosity are among the important parameters affecting pressure drop. In the present work, effect of these parameters on pressure drop has been investigated using a <b>computational</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>dynamics</b> approach. For solving the equations, a commercial CFD package, Fluent 6, was used. The results have been compared with experimental data as well as Bravo model and show good agreement. The average relative errors obtained are between 3. 3 % and 16. 1 %. From the results it is shown that pressure drop decreases with decreasing specific surface area of the packing, increasing bed porosity, increasing the channel angle with respect to vertical and increasing the channel dimensions. By increasing the channel angle from 45 to 60 °, pressure drop decreases by 59. 6 %. Increasing the bed porosity from 62 to 98 % results in 40 % decrease in pressure drop. For Flexipak structured packings, a decrease of 49 % in specific surface area results in 57. 6 % decrease in pressure drop.

Attempts to solve turbulent flow using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately.

There are inherent uncertainties and errors associated with using <b>Computational</b> <b>Fluid</b> <b>Dynamics</b> to predict the airflow field around a spacecraft from the Environmental Control System. This paper describes an approach to quantify the uncertainty in using <b>Computational</b> <b>Fluid</b> <b>Dynamics</b> to predict airflow speeds around an encapsulated spacecraft without the use of test data. Quantifying the uncertainty in analytical predictions is imperative to the success of any simulation-based product. The method could provide an alternative to traditional "validation by test only" mentality. This method could be extended to other disciplines and has potential to provide uncertainty for any numerical simulation, thus lowering the cost of performing these verifications while increasing the confidence in those predictions. Spacecraft requirements can include a maximum airflow speed to protect delicate instruments during ground processing. <b>Computational</b> <b>Fluid</b> <b>Dynamics</b> can be used to verify these requirements; however, the model must be validated by test data. This research includes the following three objectives and methods. Objective one is develop, model, and perform a <b>Computational</b> <b>Fluid</b> <b>Dynamics</b> analysis of three (3) generic, non-proprietary, environmental control systems and spacecraft configurations. Several commercially available and open source solvers have the capability to model the turbulent, highly three-dimensional, incompressible flow regime.

Objective two is to perform an uncertainty analysis of the <b>Computational</b> <b>Fluid</b> <b>Dynamics</b> model using the methodology found in "Comprehensive Approach to Verification and Validation of <b>Computational</b> <b>Fluid</b> <b>Dynamics</b> Simulations". This method requires three separate grids and solutions, which quantify the error bars around <b>Computational</b> <b>Fluid</b> <b>Dynamics</b> predictions.
