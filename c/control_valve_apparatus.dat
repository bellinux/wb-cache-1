To plan mitral valve repair by annuloplasty and papillary muscle (PPM) relocation, we proposed a valve repair procedure oriented by the new main features obtained by real-time 3 D TOE reconstruction of the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>apparatus.</b> METHODS: Since January 2008, 25 patients with severe FMR before mitral valve repair were examined. Mean coaptation depth and mean tenting area were 1. 3 +/- 0. 2 cm and 3. 2 +/- 0. 5 cm(2), respectively. Intraoperative 2 D and 3 D TOE were performed, followed by a 3 D offline reconstruction of the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>apparatus.</b> A schematic mitral <b>valve</b> <b>apparatus</b> model was obtained. A geometric model like a truncated cone was traced in according to the preoperative measurements. The size of the prosthetic ring was selected preoperatively according to the anterior leaflet surface. The expected truncated cone after annuloplasty was retraced. A conventional normal coaptation depth about 0. 6 cm was used to detect the new position of the PPM tips. RESULTS: Offline reconstruction of the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>apparatus</b> and respective truncated cone were feasible in all patients.

The value of the additional information provided by three-dimensional echocardiography compared with two-dimensional multiplane transesophageal echocardiography for evaluation of the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>apparatus</b> has not been assessed. Methods. Thirty patients {{with a variety of}} mitral valve pathologies (stenosis in 8, insufficiency in 12, prostheses in 10) and 20 subjects with a normal mitral valve were studied.

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R

There were six oil <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> on the system, including a lube oil pressure <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> one flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on the inlet end of the compressor, another flow <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on the discharge end, two differential pressure controllers to maintain differential pressure on the seals for {{each end of the}} compressor, as well as a back pressure <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for the oil system.

40|$|Abstract- Stiction in <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> is an {{extremely}} nonlinear {{and one of the}} long-standing problems in a closed loop control system, since the controller will push the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to move until the controlled variable reaches the desired value. Stiction moves the <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> to extreme positions so that the process output will force to produce overshoot. Then, the action gets repeated as the controller output reverses its direction. The limit cycle generated, when the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> sticks and slips during a change in input signal is called stick/slip cycle, will induce vibrations. As the control loops in an industrial plant are interlinked each other; these oscillations will be propagated to the entire system. In this critical situation the only option is to go for maintenance of the faulty valves, which may be recommended / possible only during process shut down. But, shutting down the process for maintenance of defective valves is not an economical option. Hence, {{it is very important to}} provide an efficient technique to compensate the nonlinear effect of the stiction in faulty <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> especially when it is not under maintenance.
