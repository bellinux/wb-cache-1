This thesis {{will be based on}} a single case study where the main focus is <b>Call</b> <b>me’s</b> campaign. The empirical basis is a qualitative document analysis and {{in the first part of}} the analysis I have made a linguistic analysis of <b>Call</b> <b>me,</b> and their use of instruments in the text "About Us" and in their campaign film. Afterwards I have selected unspecified society actors and analysed their articulation of <b>Call</b> <b>me’s</b> brand and in the end held it up against <b>Call</b> <b>me's</b> own story. In conclusion the stories were similar to <b>Call</b> <b>me’s</b> own presentation but which consequences does it have when others start articulating <b>Call</b> <b>me’s</b> brand? My theoretical background is grounded in Heidi Hansen branding theory, Holmströms and Kjærbecks legitimacy theory and Clara Shih’s instructions for use of social media for marketing. In the end of the thesis I based the discussion on whether <b>Call</b> <b>me's</b> campaign were described as successful and trustworthy and whether <b>Call</b> <b>me</b> manage to create legitimacy in their self-presentation. The conclusion was not all clear but <b>Call</b> <b>me’s</b> campaign could be described as successful both in economic and valuable terms...|$|R
