40|$|The Great Capricorn beetle, Cerambyx cerdo, and Mediterranean oak {{habitats}} (Quercus ilex – 9340 and Quercus suber – 9330) {{are protected}} by the Habitats Directive (HD). However, in the Mediterranean basin, these habitats are also traditionally used for animal, wood, and <b>cork</b> <b>productions.</b> Cerambyx cerdo feeds into the wood of trees and can be perceived by forest practitioners as an umbrella species or as a pest, depending on the context. Monitoring programmes involving forest practitioners could thus focus on assessing: 1) the conservation status of the Great Capricorn beetle and habitats (distribution and abundance of insects and reproductive sites or colonised trees), 2) pest status, and 3) management options to achieve both conservational and economic benefits. Considering that Cerambyx cerdo and Cork and Holm oak forests are not priority species or habitats under the HD, targeted funding {{is likely to be}} limited for monitoring. In this context, citizen science could gather important information on the target species useful for the monitoring programmes and management. To address management questions, the citizen science based programme for Cerambyx cerdo monitoring and habitat conservation should be seen not only as citizens collecting good data sets, but also as a deeper collaboration amongst different knowledge bodies and perspectives within a community – based environmental monitoring and learning network...|$|R

40|$|This bachelor's {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to using wood in wine-making. Firstly, is focused on chemical composition of wood and its physical parametres, its individual components in particular. There are described types of woods mostly used in viticulture and its consecutive utilisation at coopery. An individual chapter {{is dedicated to}} coopery where are described: technological manufacturing of timber, burning out the barrels {{and its effect on}} the change of their chemical characteristics as well as analysing the barrels as means to wine fertilisation and wine ripening. There is also mentioned individually the barrique-type barrels and barrels for ageing of special (mostly fortified) wines. In this connection possible diseases and flaws of wines connected to ageing in wooden barrels are described. The following chapter focuses on using preparations replacing barrique barrels which also add oak and vanilla shades to wine such as wooden chippings, desks and oak bore dust. A special attention is paid to <b>corks,</b> their <b>production,</b> types and effect on wine while ageing in bottles.

30|$|Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) {{forests are}} part of Mediterranean {{ecosystems}} of Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Morocco that, besides their high socio-economic value resulting from the exploitation of cork, play a significant ecological role. They are a permanent component of the landscape, a significant barrier against forest fires, {{and a source of}} a remarkable biodiversity due to the high habitat heterogeneity (Natividade 1950; Pausas et al. 2009). Especially in Iberian Peninsula that accounts for near 90 % of <b>cork</b> world <b>production</b> and where most studies have been done this ecosystem has been under the threat of a progressive decline for which the main biological contributing factor was shown to be the root parasite Phytophthora cinnamomi, one of the most destructive Phytophthora species (Brasier et al. 1993; Caetano 2007; Moreira-Marcelino 2001). Despite the ecological and economic importance of cork oak, the pathosystem Quercus-P. cinnamomi has not received sufficient attention and molecular interaction studies are scarce. Also, rising concerns about the expected spread of P. cinnamomi to Northern and Eastern regions in Europe, as a consequence of climatic changes (Brasier 2003; Jung 2009) justify the investment in increasing the knowledge of this pathosystem.|$|R
40|$|Cork boiling {{wastewater}} (CBW) is an aqueous {{and complex}} effluent of the cork industry which is produced during the boiling of the cork planks, {{one of the}} key operations in cork processing for <b>cork</b> stoppers <b>production.</b> CBW contains suspended and dissolved solids and organic materials such as phenolic compounds and is characterized by a low biodegradability and an acid pH.

Natural cork stoppers are the main product associated to this activity and their production process generates low biodegradability wastewaters, namely during cork boiling and stoppers washing. The recalcitrant compounds present in these type of wastewaters, such as phenolic compounds, are the main responsible for its high toxicity and consequent low biodegradability, therefore conventional biological treatment plants aren´t the suitable {{for this kind of}} effluent.

The significant differences between cork from stored and from unstored slabs were evident in protocatechuic, 4 -hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, and ferulic acids. Storage of slabs increased the amount of extractable cinnamic acids. On the other hand, boiling decreased the concentration of the same phenolic acids and increased that of vanillin. Boiling after storage can be beneficial to the cork quality, {{reducing the amount of}} potentially negative flavor compounds (cinnamic acids) and increasing potentially positive flavor compounds (vanillin) ...|$|R

In 2010 and 2011, we studied the biology, behaviour, {{harmfulness}} {{and distribution of}} the population of L. brunneus and S. quercus in cork oak forests in Sardinia. During their life cycle, the two trophobionts benefit from the protection provided by the cork bark. In particular, the aphid undergoes a monoic holocycle, spending much of the year inside the ant nest. Our investigations on the distribution of infested trees suggested that they are grouped into clusters, even though we occasionally found cork oaks (especially large ones) colonized by the formicid without any attacks on the surrounding trees. The ant also digs its nests in the female <b>cork,</b> damaging the <b>production,</b> and its infestations involved up to 20 % of the cork oaks.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the possibility of using polyols derived from liquefied <b>cork</b> in the <b>production</b> of novel bio-based polyurethane foams (PUFs). For that purpose, different liquefaction conditions were used at atmospheric pressure and moderate temperature where poly(ethylene glycol) and glycerol were used as solvents and sulfuric acid as catalyst. The ensuing polyols were used to produce foams which were characterized using structural, morphological, thermal and mechanical analyses to demonstrate that liquefaction conditions play a crucial role in the properties of the foams. The resulting foams exhibited the typical cellular structure of PUFs with low densities (57. 4 - 70. 7 kgm(- 3)) and low thermal conductivities (0. 038 - 0. 040 Wm(- 1) K(- 1)). However, the mechanical properties differed significantly depending on the liquefaction conditions. The best stress-strain results were obtained for PUFs prepared using the polyol with lowest I-OH and water content (Young's modulus of 475. 0 kPa, compressive stress (sigma(10 %)) of 34. 6 kPa and toughness of 7397. 1 Jm(- 3)). This PUF was thermally stable up to 200 degrees C and presented a glass transition temperature of around 27 degrees C.
