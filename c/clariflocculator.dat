40|$|Treatment of Hot Liquid Waste: Three runs, D- 73, D- 74, and D- 75, {{were made}} in the model <b>clariflocculator</b> during this period. In D- 73 and D- 74 a mixture of {{hydrolysis}} supernatant and water was used as the original solution and in D- 75 a hydrolysis supernatant, bismuth free activity and water mixture was used as the starting solution. D- 73 gave acceptable results, but D- 74 and D- 75 gave results that were not too satisfactory. It is believed that contamination in the laboratory has effected the results. Recovery of Bismuth: Experiments were resumed on the electrolytic extraction of bismuth from a hydrochloric acid solution of bismuth chloride. Plating at elevated temperature with the elimination of calcium chloride resulted in a lower average deposition rate of 2. 07 g. /amp. {minus}hr. than was obtained at room temperature in the presence of calcium chloride with a deposition rate of 2. 30 g. /amp. {minus}hr. Another comparison was made between cathodes prepared in a wood mold and a ``Herculite`` mold. Unlike the results obtained in run E- 15 in which the cathode prepared in the ``Herculite`` mold gave a greater average deposition rate, the same deposition rate of 2. 00 g/amp. {minus}hr. was obtained with both cathodes. The formation of crystals was more prevalent {{in the case of the}} cathode cast in the wood mold. In run E- 24 a cathode with a rough surface-was prepared by lining the side of the mold with carborundum cloth. The deposit consisted of nodules over the entire surface and very little treeing at the edges. Treatment of Hot Solid Burnable Waste: The final enclosure of the incinerator with asbestos and transite is in progress. Preliminary consideration is being given to the steam expansion method of cleaning air as a means of removing the activity which would be carried over in the flu gases...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} items of equipment have been completed: Two Scaler Multipliers, EO- 18 and EO- 338, undergoing test and adjustment. One Thyratron Heater Control for Scioto Laboratory. One Pilot model switch box for Group 16 hoods at Scioto Laboratory. One Pilot model patch box used as auxiliary {{to the present}} switch boxes. Installation of electronic equipment and sorting and cataloguing of stock at Scioto Laboratory has been started. The Y Section induction heaters have been installed electrically. With the present setup in the WD Building, it has been necessary to recycle all the solution which passes through the pH chamber on the <b>clariflocculators.</b> Sufficient tests have been run on the Berkeley Decimal scaler to indicate that, by using a pre-emplifier, {{it will be a}} satisfactory replacement for the scaler multiplier. Reworking of B-wall tubes has been held up pending the delivery of neon gas. Further investigations have been made on the frequency compensated constant voltage Sola transformers. Three automatic potential controllers have been modified in accordance with investigations of Group 10. The program of preventative maintenance on automatic potential controllers has resulted in a marked reduction of service calls and down-time for the operating group...|$|R
