By 1947 it is {{estimated}} that 400,000 Germans (both civilians and POWs) were being used as forced labor by the U.S., France, the UK, and the Soviet Union. German prisoners were for example forced to clear minefields in France and the Low Countries.

50|$|After the war, the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey {{reviewed}} the available <b>casualty</b> <b>records</b> in Germany, {{and concluded that}} official German statistics of casualties from air attack had been too low.

40|$|Emergency {{care for}} eye {{complaints}} is provided both by accident and emergency (A&E) departments {{as well as}} by dedicated eye casualty departments. This study examines the role of each type of department and the quality of eye care provided. Significant {{differences were found between the}} accident and emergency department and the eye casualty department in the history, examination and management of eye patients. Most notably, there were significant differences in the quality of the assessment in the two institutions. Overall 19 % (19 / 100) of A&E records had an inadequate history, compared with 2 % (1 / 50) for eye <b>casualty</b> <b>records.</b> Fifty-nine per cent (59 / 100) of A&E records contained a significant examination omission, compared with only 8 % (4 / 50) of eye <b>casualty</b> <b>records.</b> Most of the omissions related to a failure to perform an adequate, yet simple, ocular examination including failure to record visual acuity.

German protests that forcing POWs to clear mines was against international law, article 32 of the Geneva conventions, were rejected with the assertion that the Germans were not POWs; they were disarmed forces who had surrendered unconditionally ("avvæpnede styrker som hadde overgitt seg betingelsesløst"). Mine clearance reports received by the Allied Forces Headquarters state: June 21, 1945; 199 dead and 163 wounded Germans; 3 Norwegians and 4 British wounded. The last registration, from August 29, 1945 lists 392 wounded and 275 dead Germans. Mine clearance was then for unknown reasons halted for close to a year before recommencing under better conditions during June-September 1946. This time many volunteered thanks to good pay, and death rates were much lower, possibly {{thanks in part to}} a deal permitting them medical treatment at Norwegian hospitals.|$|E

40|$|To {{achieve a}} significant, lasting and sought after {{behaviour}} change within any discipline is a frequently stated goal. Within road safety {{this is no}} different. As the government now looks forward to its next road safety strategy we must recognise that whilst the UK has made significant progress in improving safety on our roads, notably the historic achievement in Great Britain in 2007 of reducing road deaths to below 3000 {{for the first time}} 1, there is still considerable work to be done. Much hard work has gone into achieving this reduction by engineers, road safety officers, police forces, MPs and campaigners amongst many. The targets outlined in ‘Tomorrow’s Roads- Safer for Everyone ’ 2 have been impressively surpassed. Yet the UK is falling behind its counterparts Sweden and the Netherlands in terms of its road <b>casualty</b> <b>record</b> 3. The question we must now ask is how to achieve further reductions?

40|$|Highway Authorities in the United Kingdom have {{jurisdiction}} to control, maintain {{and improve the}} local highway network, and the Road Traffic Act 1988 places a duty on such authorities to take preventative measures to reduce road casualties. As such, engineers working for the Highway Authority are on the ‘front-line,’ and are required to deal directly with lay concerns relating to road safety. This study investigates the nature and characteristics of how local road safety issues are raised and how engineers respond to such issues in a local authority setting. A grounded theory methodology was applied in the collection and analysis of this data, and in the generation of subsequent emergent themes. Datasets were established containing textual data from correspondence between the lay public and the authority, and from local press reporting. This was augmented by 47 semi-structured interviews with engineers. The analysis demonstrates that road safety issues and their construction, form a distinct genre. There are certain characteristic structural elements and argumentative approaches, which are oft repeated, in lay formulations of road safety. Road safety issues are played out in a contested field, although engineers may have, in theory, the ‘expertise’ that grants them authority to assess, diagnose and implement mitigation measures; in practice they have little autonomy or control. Regulatory restrictions, political interference, resource impoverishment and a volatile public, severely limit engineers’ independence and discretion. In dealing with the exigencies and pressures of day-to-day front-line public service, engineers deploy certain strategies for ‘managing’ the public. These pragmatic strategies are examined {{in order to establish}} how engineers can best effect practical action, in the face of competing and often conflicting demands. In examining the rhetorical organisation of lay argumentative strategies, a ‘popular epidemiology’ of road safety is recreated. This term, borrowed from Brown (1992), encapsulates a folk philosophy with respect to accident causation and the measures that are considered necessary or appropriate to ameliorate/eliminate identified issues. It is suggested that in vivo formulations of road safety issues, such as the ‘accident waiting to happen’ are founded on vague premises, and constitute a category mistake. Projections from phenomenally troubling, yet largely unsubstantiable events, to those with profound material consequences, are neither necessary nor certain. In making decisions on substantial capital investments, engineers, by necessity, are required to assess competing sites on a more epistemically secure metric, namely the police road <b>casualty</b> <b>record...</b>|$|E
