5000|$|Shoemaker Nils Gregoriusson Tveranger (1874-1953) in Aurland, Norway, {{introduced}} his first design around 1908. At age 13 Tveranger went to North America {{where he learned}} the craft of shoemaking and returned to Norway age 20. Around 1930, Tveranger introduced a new design called the [...] "Aurland moccasin", later renamed the [...] "Aurland shoe". This design resembles the moccasins used by the Iroquois {{as well as the}} design of moccasin-like shoes traditionally worn by locals in Aurland. The Norwegians began exporting them to the rest of Europe, where they were taken up by visiting Americans, and championed by the American Esquire magazine. Some photographs included with the Esquire feature were of Norwegian farmers in a cattle loafing area. [...] The Spaulding family in New Hampshire started making shoes based on this design in the early 1930s, naming them loafers, a general term for slip-on shoes which is still in use in America. In 1934, G.H. Bass (a bootmaker in Wilton, Maine) started making loafers under the name Weejuns (sounding like Norwegians). The distinctive addition was a strip of leather across the saddle with a diamond cut-out. Initially only worn in the summer at home, the shoe grew in popularity in America to become a significant part of men's <b>casual</b> <b>shoe</b> wardrobe; in Europe the style has never reached the same degree of ubiquity.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Ethylene/Styrene Interpolymers (ESI) {{currently}} under develop-ment by The Dow Chemical Company can be effectively crosslinked using current commercial equipment to produce extruded sheets, bun foams, and injection molded foams (IMF) for footwear parts providing properties that enhance and/or outperform current foams of crosslinked {{ethylene vinyl acetate}} copolymers (EVA).
