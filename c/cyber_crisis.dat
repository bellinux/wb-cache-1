5000|$|On February 16, 2010, BPC hosted [...] "Cyber ShockWave", a {{simulated}} cyber {{attack on the}} United States. The simulation, which was moderated by Wolf Blitzer and broadcast as a special on CNN, provided {{a look at how}} the government would respond to a large-scale <b>cyber</b> <b>crisis</b> affecting much of the nation. The simulation was created by former CIA Director General Michael Hayden (general) and BPC's National Security Preparedness Group, led by the co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission, Governor Thomas Kean and Congressman Lee H.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} military support to civil authorities {{in the event of}} a national <b>cyber</b> <b>crisis</b> in Norway, with special emphasis on the Norwegian Cyber Force. In later years, Norway’s nationwide mobile network has collapsed at several occasions. In March 2013, it was revealed that the Norwegian telecom corporation, Telenor, was itself exposed to industrial espionage. The ensuing investigation unveiled a sophisticated Indian cyber attack infrastructure compromising corporations and governments worldwide. In principle, Norway’s military should defend the nation against external threats, whereas the police should handle domestic threats. The police, however, have neither sufficient resources nor the competence to handle large-scale cyber terrorism. The Norwegian Cyber Force, on the other hand, has technology, expertise and experience from operating, monitoring and defending its own nationwide infrastructure. In the event of a <b>cyber</b> <b>crisis,</b> coordinating expert organs such as the Norwegian National Security Authority with its CERT will step in (the NSA reporting both to the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Justice). Regular civilmilitary cooperation and exercise is vital to preventing security threats, as was shown in the autumn of 2013, when Telenor initiated a large-scale exercise together with NorCERT, the police, several banks, private computer security companies, and the Norwegian Cyber Force. If civilian e-com infrastructure is targeted by an attack that puts vital social interests, life or health in danger, the Norwegian Cyber Force will be able to support the civil authorities with various special competencies, ranging from smaller teams of advisors to large military units...|$|E

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of martial rhetoric {{in connection with}} the release of thousands of pages of sensitive government documents by the WikiLeaks organization underlines how easily words that have legal meanings can be indiscriminately applied to cyber events in ways that can confuse decision makers and strategists alike. The WikiLeaks phenomenon is but {{the latest in a series}} of recent cyber-related incidents––ranging from <b>cyber</b> <b>crises</b> in Estonia and Georgia to reports of the Stuxnet cyberworm allegedly infecting Iranian computers––that have contributed to a growing perception that “cyberwar” is inevitable, if not already underway. All of this generates a range of legal questions, with popular wisdom being that the law is inadequate or lacking entirely. Lt Gen Keith B. Alexander, the first commander of US Cyber Command, told Congress at his April 2010 confirmation hearings that there was a “mismatch between our technical capabilities to conduct operations and the governing laws and policies. ” Likewise, Jeffrey Addicott, a highly respected cyber-law authority, asserts that “international laws associated with the use of force are woefully inadequate in terms of addressing the threat of cyberwarfare. ” This article takes a somewhat different tact concerning the ability of the law of armed conflict (LOAC) to address cyber issues. Specifically, it argues that while there is certainly room for improvement in some areas, the basic tenets of LOAC are sufficient to address the most important issues of cyberwar. Among other things, this article contends that very often the real difficulty with respect to the law and cyberwar is not any lack of “law,” per se, but rather in the complexities that arise in determining the necessary facts which must be applied to the law to render legal judgments...|$|R
50|$|Klavans was {{appointed}} by the White House {{to serve on the}} President’s Information Technology Advisory Board (PITAC), a bi-partisan science advisory board. PITAC was authorized by Congress under the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 (P. L. 102-194) and the Next Generation Internet Act of 1998 (P. L. 105-305) as a Federal Advisory Committee. During this tenure (2003-2005), Klavans participated in three major scientific studies: Report to the President on Revolutionizing Health Care Through Information Technology (June 2004); Report to the President on <b>Cyber</b> Security: A <b>Crisis</b> of Prioritization (February 2005); Report to the President on Computational Science: Ensuring America's Competitiveness (June 2005). Klavans has been invited to contribute to studies by the National Academies of Science on the role of maps in emergency response; her role in this effort was to focus on the linguistic requirements of response management.|$|R
40|$|Crisis {{situations}} require critical {{decision making}} under high uncertainty and time pressure. These decisions can impact an organization internally and externally when remained unhandled. However, {{due to the}} rarity of crisis events, {{there is a lack}} of training on the job. A designed simulation game should offer a training methodology which takes crisis characteristics into consideration, include cyber domain consideration and offer a safe environment to practice decision making in. This paper presents the outcomes of a design process for this purpose. The proposed game immerses participants into a new world, in which a <b>cyber</b> <b>crisis</b> has occurred. The design is perceived as useful by participants but also provides three key findings for future design. The simulation game offers opportunity for extension, including for testing models and theories or as a foundation for similar game design.

40|$|What, exactly, is “National Cyber Security”?  The rise of {{cyberspace}} {{as a field}} of human endeavour is probably nothing less {{than one of the}} most significant developments in world history. Cyberspace already directly impacts every facet of human existence including economic, social, cultural and political developments, and the rate of change is not likely to stop anytime soon. However, the socio-political answers to the questions posed by the rise {{of cyberspace}} often significantly lag behind the rate of technological change. One of the fields most challenged by this development is that of “national security”. This book provides detailed background information and in-depth theoretical frameworks to help the reader understand the various facets of National Cyber Security, according to different levels of public policy formulation. The four levels of government - political, strategic, operational and tactical/technical - each have their own perspectives on National Cyber Security, and each is addressed in individual sections within the Manual. Additionally, the Manual gives examples of relevant institutions in National Cyber Security, from top-level policy coordination bodies down to <b>cyber</b> <b>crisis</b> management structures and similar institutions...|$|E
40|$|Das Handbuch dokumentiert die Ergebnisse interdisziplinärer Forschung zu Phänomenen der Netzbildung und -entwicklung, der Entscheidungsunterstützung und der Entscheidungsfindung sowie der Modellierung und Planung der Koordination von Netzwerkakteuren - Organisationen oder Einzelpersonen – im Bereich des Krisenmanagement. Krisen sind {{disruptive}} Ereignisse von erheblichem Ausmaß, wie Naturkatastrophen oder Terrorakte, aber auch disruptive Innovationen. Band 2 des Handbuchs konzentriert sich auf organisatorische Facetten des Krisenmanagement am Beispiel von zwei Anwendungsfeldern: Cybersecurity und Rettungsdienste. The handbook aims to codify, align and disseminate {{research results}} {{that focus on}} the phenomena of network formation and evolution, the decision support and decision-making, as well as the modelling and planning aimed at coordination of network actors - organizations or individuals – in crisis management. Whereby we refer to crises as disruptive events of significant magnitude, such as natural disasters, acts of terrorism but also disruptive innovation. This volume serves as a forum for researchers with an interest in social value creation in dynamic networked situations. It brings together scholars (and practitioners) from several disciplines and practices that want to understand social value creation: reactions of a network to disasters, and prevention of possible disasters within these networks. To that end they study various contexts such as the epidemic diffusion of a <b>cyber</b> <b>crisis,</b> the identity management to increase cyber security and the use of social media by the police to gather information and coordinate in case of disasters. This volume has theoretical roots in a variety of theoretical perspectives and disciplines such as diffusion modelling, IT security management and communication sciences...|$|E
