At weekly intervals from flowering until maturity, fruits (or selected parts thereof) were analyzed for (a) fresh and dry weights, (b) prunasin and amygdalin levels, and (c) {{levels of the}} <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> amygdalin hydrolase, prunasin hydrolase, and mandelonitrile lyase. During phase I (0 - 28 days after flowering [DAF]), immature fruits accumulated prunasin (mean: 3 micromoles/fruit) but were acyanogenic because they lacked the above enzymes. Concomitant with cotyledon development during mid-phase II, the seeds began accumulating both amygdalin (mean: 3 micromoles/seed) and the <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> and were highly cyanogenic upon tissue disruption. Meanwhile, prunasin levels rapidly declined and were negligible by maturity. During phases II (29 - 65 DAF) and III (66 - 81 DAF), the pericarp also accumulated amygdalin, whereas its prunasin content declined toward maturity.

We therefore engineered Z. palmae so as to broaden the range of its fermentable sugar substrates to include the pentose sugar xylose. The Escherichia coli genes encoding the xylose <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> xylose isomerase, xylulokinase, transaldolase, and transketolase were introduced into Z. palmae, where their expression was driven by the Zymomonas mobilis glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. When cultured with 40 g/liter xylose, the recombinant Z. palmae strain was able to ferment 16. 4 g/liter xylose within 5 days, producing 91 % of the theoretical yield of ethanol with no accumulation of organic acids as metabolic by-products. Notably, xylose acclimation enhanced both the expression of xylose <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> and the rate of xylose uptake into recombinant Z. palmae, which enabled the acclimated organism to completely and simultaneously ferment a mixture of 40 g/liter glucose and 40 g/liter xylose within 8 h, producing 95 % of the theoretical yield of ethanol. Thus, efficient fermentation of a mixture of glucose and xylose to ethanol can be accomplished by using Z. palmae expressing E. coli xylose <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Retinoic acid (RA) is {{a potent}} {{regulator}} of gene transcription via its activation {{of a set of}} nuclear receptors controlling transcriptional activation. Precise maintenance of where and when RA is generated is essential and achieved by local expression of synthetic and <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> The <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> Cyp 26 a 1 and Cyp 26 b 1 have been studied in detail in the embryo, where they limit gradients of RA that form patterns of gene expression, crucial for morphogenesis. This paracrine role of RA has been assumed to occur in most tissues and that the RA synthetic enzymes release RA at a site distant from the <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes.</b> In contrast to the embryonic CNS, relatively little is known about RA metabolism in the adult brain. This study investigated the distribution of Cyp 26 a 1 and Cyp 26 b 1 transcripts in the rat brain, identifying several novel regions of expression, including the cerebral cortex for both enzymes and striatum for Cyp 26 b 1. In vivo use of a new and potent inhibitor of the Cyp 26 enzymes, ser 2 – 7, demonstrated a function for endogenous Cyp 26 in the brain and that hippocampal RA levels can be raised by ser 2 – 7, altering the effect of RA on differential patterning of cell proliferation in the hippocampal region of neurogenesis, the subgranular zone. The expression of CYP 26 A 1 and CYP 26 B 1 was also investigated in the adult human brain and colocalization of CYP 26 A 1 and the RA synthetic enzyme RALDH 2 indicated a different, autocrine role for RA in human hippocampal neurons. Studies with the SH-SY 5 Y human neuroblastoma cell line implied that the co-expression of RA synthetic and <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> maintains retinoid homeostasis within neurons.

In October 1966, he obtained deep-frozen autopsy material from an infantile case with amaurotic idiocy. The glycolipid analysis soon demonstrated differences from all the cases studied before. Besides the neuronal storage of GM2, the storage of GA2 was much more pronounced, and different from all cases of Tay-Sachs disease studied so far, globoside accumulated in the visceral organs and, most importantly, hexosaminidase activity was almost completely absent. The disease causing <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzyme</b> deficiency of hexosaminidases was demonstrated with four different substrates (p-nitrophenyl-β-D-N-acetylglucosaminide, p-nitrophenyl-β-D-N-acetylgalactosaminide, glycolipid 3HGA2 and 3Hgloboside) in four different organs and published in 1968.|$|E

30|$|The {{physiological}} and proteomic approaches complement each other, and their combination {{can lead to}} a better understanding of bacterial response under different growth conditions. In particular, the comparative physiological study of P. putida growth on citrate and benzoate, followed by proteomic analysis, revealed unexpectedly diverse cellular mechanisms required for changing from one C-source to another. First, we confirmed earlier findings and detected all enzymes of the peripheral catabolism of benzoate through the catechol ortho-cleavage pathway. Two other upregulated <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> suggested that the protocatechuate ortho-cleavage pathway could also play a role in benzoate degradation. Moreover, <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> for benzoate were presumed to induce the observed upregulation of an arylsulfatase, which could be essential for the catabolism of sulfated aromatic hydrocarbons co-existing in nature with benzoate. A second category of proteins was upregulated to optimize uptake of respective exogenous C-substrates (i.e. specific benzoate and citrate transporters).|$|R
40|$|SummaryGlycosylceramides in {{mammalian}} {{species are}} thought to be present in the form of β-anomers. This conclusion was reinforced by the identification of only one glucosylceramide and one galactosylceramide synthase, both β-transferases, in mammalian genomes. Thus, the possibility that small amounts of α-anomers could be produced by an alternative enzymatic pathway, by an unfaithful enzyme, or spontaneously in unusual cellular compartments has not been examined in detail. We approached the question by taking advantage of the exquisite specificity of T and B lymphocytes and combined it with the specificity of <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> of the sphingolipid pathway. Here, we demonstrate that mammalian immune cells produce constitutively very small quantities of α-glycosylceramides, which are the major endogenous ligands of natural killer T cells. <b>Catabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> of the ceramide and glycolipid pathway tightly control the amount of these α-glycosylceramides.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine the capacity of the biphenyl <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes</b> of Comamonas testosteroni B- 356 to metabolize dihydroxybiphenyls symmetrically substituted on both rings. Data show that 3, 3 ′-dihydroxybiphenyl is by far the preferred substrate for strain B- 356. However, the dihydrodiol metabolite is very unstable and readily tautomerizes to a dead-end metabolite or is dehydroxylated by elimination of water. The tautomerization route is the most prominent. Thus, a very small fraction of the substrate is converted to other hydroxylated and acidic metabolites. Although 2, 2 ′-dihydroxybiphenyl is a poor substrate for strain B- 356 biphenyl dioxygenase, metabolites were produced by the biphenyl <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzymes,</b> leading to production of 2 -hydroxybenzoic acid. Data show that the major route of metabolism involves, as a first step, a direct dehydroxylation of one of the ortho-substituted carbons to yield 2, 3, 2 ′-trihydroxybiphenyl.

40|$|Abstract: N-Acetyl-L-aspartate (NAA) and its {{derivative}} N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) {{are major}} osmolytes {{present in the}} vertebrate brain. Although they are synthe-sized primarily in neurons, their function in these cells is unclear. In the brain, these substances undergo inter-compartmental cycles {{in which they are}} released by neu-rons in a regulated fashion and are then rapidly hydro-lyzed by catabolic enzymes associated with glial cells. Recently, the <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzyme</b> for NAA hydrolysis {{has been found to be}} expressed only in oligodendrocytes, and the <b>catabolic</b> <b>enzyme</b> for NAAG expressed only in astrocytes. These results indicate an unusual tricellular metabolic sequence for the synthesis and hydrolysis of NAAG wherein it is synthesized in neurons from NAA and L-glutamate, hydrolyzed to NAA and L-glutamate by as-trocytes, and further hydrolyzed to L-aspartate and ace-tate by oligodendrocytes. Since the discovery that the NAA and NAAG anabolic products of neurons are spe-cifically targeted to oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, re-spectively, this unique metabolic compartmentalization also suggests that these substances may play an impor-tant role in cell-specific glial signaling. In this review, it is hypothesized that a key function of NAA and NAAG in the vertebrate brain is in cell signaling and that these sub-stances are important in the regulation of interactions of brain cells and in the establishment and maintenance of the nervous system.

Constitutive mutants were rapidly selected during continuous culture on a mixture of glucose and lactose, and the β-galactosidase level of the culture increased greatly. After mutant selection, the specific β-galactosidase level of the culture was a decreasing function of growth rate. In cultures of both the inducible wild type and the constitutive mutant, glucose and lactose were simultaneously utilized at moderate growth rates, whereas only glucose {{was used in the}} inducible cultures at high growth rates. Catabolite repression was shown to be the primary mechanism of control of β-galactosidase level and lactose utilization in continuous culture on mixed substrates. In batch culture, as in the chemostat, catabolite repression acting by itself on the lac enzymes was insufficient to prevent lactose utilization or cause diauxie.
