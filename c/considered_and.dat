Geetha Arts collaborated with Udhayanidhi Stalin for the Tamil version and distributed it under his production banner, Red Giant Movies. K. Bhagyaraj wrote the dialogues for Maaveeran. The Malayalam version was titled Dheera—The Warrior and was distributed by Pallavi films.|$|E

5|$|By {{the mid-1980s}} {{closure of the}} {{stations}} was being <b>considered,</b> <b>and</b> in 1984, was considered for a {{combined heat and power}} scheme. After the privatisation of the Central Electricity Generating Board in 1989, the stations passed into the ownership of National Power. After almost 37 years of use they were decommissioned in May 1991 as outdated and uneconomical to operate. They had been overtaken technologically, and had lower generating capacity than newer plants such as Drax. Their closure coincided with that {{of a large number of}} coal mines in the North East of England, just after the privatisation of both the electricity industry and the National Coal Board in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Coffelt's {{account was}} {{reviewed}} by the FBI, which concluded that it differed in significant details from information {{that had not been}} made public, and was therefore a fabrication. Brown, undeterred, continued peddling the story long after Coffelt died in 1975. Multiple media venues, including the television news program 60 Minutes, <b>considered</b> <b>and</b> rejected it. In a 2008 book about Lincoln's descendants, author Charles Lachman revisited Coffelt's tale although it had been discredited 36 years before.|$|E
5|$|Development on {{the project}} began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Sorkin wrote the {{screenplay}} with filming beginning in January 2015.

Editing was extensive {{on the project}}, with editor Elliot Graham noting that {{he was working on}} existing footage while the film was still shooting. Daniel Pemberton served as the film's composer, with a focus dedicated to dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.|$|E

5|$|Even the maps, {{of which}} Tolkien {{originally}} proposed five, were <b>considered</b> <b>and</b> debated. He wished Thror's map to be tipped in (that is, glued {{in after the}} book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with the moon-letters (almost identical to Anglo-Saxon runes) on the reverse {{so they could be}} seen when held up to the light. In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers, Thror's map, and the Map of Wilderland, both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.|$|E
5|$|He is also {{credited}} with the writing of A Defence of Freemasonry (1765), also known as A Defence of Freemasonry as practised in the regular lodges, both foreign and domestic, under the Constitution of the English Grand Master, in which is contained a refutation of Mr. Dermott's absurd and ridiculous account of Freemasonry, in his book entitled 'Ahiman Rezon' and the several quries therein reflecting on the regular Masons, briefly <b>considered</b> <b>and</b> answered, that response to Laurence Dermott's Ahiman Rezon. Although {{there is no direct}} attribution on the text's titlepage, it was established as his work since its publication, and it includes a poem directly attributed to him.|$|E

5|$|Operation Graffham formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. One of the key elements of Bodyguard was Operation Fortitude North, which promoted a fictional threat against Norway via wireless traffic and visual deception. Fortitude North played on German, and particularly Adolf Hitler's, belief that Norway was a key objective for the Allies (although they had earlier <b>considered</b> <b>and</b> rejected the option).|$|E
5|$|Palahniuk's {{novel was}} optioned by 20th Century Fox {{producer}} Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls {{to write the}} film adaptation. Fincher {{was one of four}} directors the producers <b>considered,</b> <b>and</b> was selected because of his enthusiasm for the film. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising. The director copied the homoerotic overtones from Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the twist ending.|$|E

Moving walkways and electric carts were both <b>considered</b> <b>and</b> rejected for the station because of engineering difficulties and cost. In 2017, the Port of Seattle began a $3.5 million capital program to improve the walk from the station to the terminal by installing windscreens and adding a cart shuttle service.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{emperors}} {{appealed to}} the West for help, but the Pope would only consider sending aid {{in return for a}} reunion of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the See of Rome. Church unity was <b>considered,</b> <b>and</b> occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy intensely resented the authority of Rome and the Latin Rite. Some Western troops arrived to bolster the Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.|$|E
5|$|The TSR-2 was {{the victim}} of ever-rising costs and inter-service squabbling over Britain's future defence needs, which led to the {{controversial}} decision to scrap the programme in 1965. With the election of a new government, the TSR-2 was cancelled due to rising costs, in favour of purchasing an adapted version of the General Dynamics F-111, a decision that itself was later rescinded as costs and development times increased. The replacements included the Blackburn Buccaneer and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, both of which had previously been <b>considered</b> <b>and</b> rejected early in the TSR-2 procurement process. Eventually, the smaller swing-wing Panavia Tornado was developed and adopted by a European consortium to fulfil broadly similar requirements to the TSR-2.|$|E
