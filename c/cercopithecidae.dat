5|$|The olive baboon (Papio anubis), {{also called}} the Anubis baboon, {{is a member of}} the family <b>Cercopithecidae</b> (Old World monkeys). The species is the most wide-ranging of all baboons, being found in 25 {{countries}} throughout Africa, extending from Mali eastward to Ethiopia and Tanzania. Isolated populations are also present in some mountainous regions of the Sahara. It inhabits savannahs, steppes, and forests. The common name is derived from its coat color, which is a shade of green-grey at a distance. A variety of communications, vocal and non-vocal, facilitate a complex social structure.|$|E
2500|$|Starting from <b>cercopithecidae,</b> the {{two sources}} from the basal ganglia system medial pallidum and nigra have distinct, {{spatially}} separate, thalamic territories. The pallidal territory arrives in evolution as a lateral {{addition to the}} nigal VA, forming a new nucleus individualized by another name : the nucleus ventralis oralis, VO. On the contrary {{there is no more}} VM (which receices convergent afferences in rodents and carnivora). VO receives its pallidal afferent axons from the medial pallidum. The trajectory of pallidal afferent axons is complex. Axons form first the ansa lenticularis and the fasciculus lenticularis which place the axons on the medial border of the pallidum. From there, the axons cross the internal capsule as the comb system. Axons arrives at the lateral border of the subthalamic nucleus. They pass over it as the H2 field of Forel (1877) then turn down at H and suddenly go up in H1 in direction to the inferior border of the thalamus. The distribution of pallidal axons within the territory is wide with terminal [...] "bunches" [...] (Arrechi-Bouchhioua et al. 1996,1997, Parent and Parent, 2004 [...] ). This offers few chance for a fine somatotopic organization. The territory is stained for calbindin. The mediator of the pallido-thalamic connection is the inhibitor GABA. The thalamocortical neurons send their axons to the supplementary motor area (SMA), preSMA, the premotordorsal and medial {{and to a lesser extent}} to the motor cortex.|$|E
