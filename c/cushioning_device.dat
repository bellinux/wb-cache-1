The fastener engages with a splint (12) i. e. orthopedic splint. A <b>cushioning</b> <b>device</b> (41) is arranged between the fastener and a lower leg splint (16) that are coupled together for transmission of force, where cushioning force of the device is adjustable. The device has a pressure detection sensor (50) that detects force or pressure in an inductive, capacitive or piezoelectric manner. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The load bearing surface of the upper leg splint is made of fibrous composite material, composite foam, natural material or gel mass. USE - Supporting apparatus for use on a splint i. e. orthopedic splint, to support a knee joint, a lower leg, a foot or an ankle (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - The configuration of the supporting apparatus permits introduction of force exerted when walking, by weight of a human body in the supporting apparatus, thus allowing a patient to walk without using crutches even during primary healing phase, in case of injury at the lower member, and hence allowing the patient to carry objects in his/her hands {{from one place to}} another. The cushioning force of the <b>cushioning</b> <b>device</b> is adjustable so as to optimize the controlled re-habilitation for quicker mobilization.

40|$|The medium {{offering}} the greatest {{resistance to heat}} transfer from the freeze-drying shelf to the moving and subliming surface is {{the space between the}} flat shelf top and the concave vial bottom. The resistance to heat transfer can be greatly reduced by improving the thermal conductivity of the intervening space. Several heat transfer augmentation devices, including a multilayered corrugated aluminum quilt and a conformable fluid <b>cushion</b> <b>device,</b> which fill this gap are described. The devices are inexpensive and easy to use. Experimental data show that the resistance of the intervening space is reduced appreciably and the drying rate is greatly increased. The fluid <b>cushion</b> <b>device</b> is superior to the aluminum quilt as it reduces the consequences of spillage of solution and provides greater intervial uniformity among the same batch of vials. Drying times obtained in experiments with and without the fluid <b>cushion</b> <b>device</b> are compared here for different sizes and different types of vials. Product evaluation is conducted by measuring the reconstitution time and observing the product under a microscope. The solubilities of two univalent electrolytes, sodium chloride and potassium chloride, have been measured in eight cosolvent-water binary systems. The solubility of both the solutes {{has been found to be}} adequately described by the log-linear solubility equation, log S(m) = log S(w) + fσ. The rank order of the desolubilization slopes obtained for the electrolyte solutes is compared with the solubilization of nonelectrolyte solutes. These results indicate that a cosolvent which is most effective in solubilizing a nonelectrolyte is also most effective in desolubilizing an electrolyte. The solubility of oxacillin sodium in methanol-water mixtures has been determined at various temperatures ranging from + 21 to - 26 degrees centigrade. The data has been fitted to the log-linear relationship as proposed by Yalkowsky et. al. The heat of solution is determined using the van't Hoff equation and was found to be nearly constant at 1. 2 Kcal/mole. There appears to be no dependency of the slope of the log S(m) vs. fraction cosolvent plot to the temperature. The data suggests that there is a polymorphic or amorphic transition of oxacillin at - 14. 5 degrees centigrade...|$|R

Yet they are faced with the task of collaboratively working as a unified team in order to achieve the company's goals. Drawing upon naturalistic data from meetings of a multinational corporation in Zurich and Amsterdam, this study aims to expand current understanding of workplace communication by exploring how two chairpersons and meeting participants use linguistic resources to contest and negotiate power relations without severely straining the corporate ties that bind them. Selected excerpts from the corpus illustrate the dynamic quality of power which can be emphasized or down-played with the use of linguistic politeness.

High-ranking chairpersons may have the power to control the content, structure and direction of the meeting but they are constrained by the very same institutional authority from which they draw power. Lower-ranking group members can and do contest power but only do so without tearing at the walls that make the team a unified whole.

It is intended to carry out impact tests {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of using wasted-tire <b>cushion</b> <b>device</b> on reducing the maximum impact force. Both impact forces and deflection were recorded by using an iron ball striking wasted-tire <b>cushion</b> <b>device.</b> The results indicate that, filling gradation crushed stones within wasted-tires can reduce the compression deflection. These tires not only serve as an effective cushion system, but also avoid damages when suffering enormous impact. The cushion can reduce the maximum impact force over 99 percent with longer impact durations. Moreover, the energy absorbed by tires appears to be more than 93 ﹪. Therefore, the application of wasted-tire cushion materials can have great effectiveness on buffering and reducing energy, and thus enhancing the safety of the structure. 由於土石流之巨礫撞擊力十分強大，容易造成防災構造物之損壞，因此本研究進行衝擊試驗，模擬防砂構造物前加置內填或不內填砂石之廢輪胎，並撞擊不同的胎面與點位，藉以探討是否能有效地消減撞擊時之能量。同時分析撞擊時消減之能量多寡，期能瞭解凹陷量與勁度等相關特性，使設計保護結構物安全時有更明確之依據。 本試驗之結果顯示，在輪胎內加入碎石級配後可以有效控制壓縮量，促使廢輪胎可以保持良好的緩衝效果，不受衝擊過大而損壞，經計算使用廢輪胎可降低 99 %左右之直接衝擊力，且衝擊歷時增加使動能消減比例至少可達 93 %以上。因此於土石流攔阻結構前可設置輪胎型式之緩衝設施，利用廢輪胎受撞擊時之變形量，提供極佳之緩衝消能效果，以達保護結構物安全之效能。第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 研究動機	 2 1. 3 研究目的	 3 第二章 文獻回顧	 4 2. 1 土石流特性	 4 2. 2 土石流之發生方式	 4 2. 3 土石流之流動	 5 2. 4 土石流巨礫撞擊力之研究	 6 2. 5 緩衝材料	 8 2. 6 廢輪胎擋土牆之經濟分析	 10 2. 7 廢輪胎於工程上之運用	 12 2. 8 廢輪胎之處理方式	 13 第三章 實驗室試驗配置	 15 3. 1 試驗設備	 15 3. 2 試驗配置	 19 3. 2. 1 渠槽基本配置	 19 3. 2. 2 試驗配置	 19 3. 3 試驗方法與步驟	 23 第四章 試驗結果	 26 4. 1 前期試驗差異	 26 4. 2 理論公式	 27 4. 3 試驗結果	 29 4. 3. 1 撞擊曲線說明	 29 4. 3. 2 第一試驗組試驗結果	 30 4. 3. 3 第二試驗組試驗結果	 40 4. 3. 4 驗證組試驗結果	 46 4. 4 試驗結果分析	 49 4. 4. 1 撞擊速度與理論衝量	 49 4. 4. 2 驗證組分析	 50 4. 4. 3 撞擊力分析	 51 4. 4. 4 實測與推算衝量之分析	 53 4. 4. 5 等效彈簧勁度計算	 56 4. 4. 5 最大撞擊力削減程度	 57 4. 4. 6 撞擊力動能折減比例之分析	 58 4. 4. 7 試驗結果與討論	 60 第五章 結論與建議	 61 5. 1 結論	 61 5. 2 建議	 62 參考文獻	 63 附錄Ι- A	 65 附錄Ι- B	 73 附錄Ι- C	 78 附錄Ι- D	 80 附錄Ι- E	 8...|$|R

40|$|Car coupler {{forces have}} a {{significant}} effect on the longitudinal train dynamics and stability. Because the coupler inertia is relatively small in comparison with the car inertia; the high stiffness associated with the coupler components can lead to high frequencies that adversely impact the computational efficiency of train models. The objective of this investigation is to study the effect of the coupler inertia on the train dynamics and on the computational efficiency as measured by the simulation time. To this end, two different models are developed for the car couplers; one model, called the inertial coupler model, includes the effect of the coupler inertia, while in the other model, called the noninertial model, the effect of the coupler inertia is neglected. Both inertial and noninertial coupler models used in this investigation are assumed to have the same coupler kinematic degrees of freedom that capture geometric nonlinearities and allow for the relative translation of the draft gears and end of car <b>cushioning</b> (EOC) <b>devices</b> as well as the relative rotation of the coupler shank. In both models, the coupler kinematic equations are expressed in terms of the car body and coupler coordinates. Both the inertial and noninertial models used in this study lead to a system of differential and algebraic equations that are solved simultaneously in order to determine the coordinates of the cars and couplers. In the case of the inertial model, the coupler kinematics is described using the absolute Cartesian coordinates, and the algebraic equations describe the kinematic constraints imposed on the motion of the system. In this case of the inertial model, the constraint equations are satisfied at the position, velocity, and acceleration levels. In the case of the noninertial model, the equations of motion are developed using the relative joint coordinates, thereby eliminating systematically the algebraic equations that represent the kinematic constraints. A quasistatic force analysis is used to determine a set of coupler nonlinear force algebraic equations for a given car configuration. These nonlinear force algebraic equations are solved iteratively to determine the coupler noninertial coordinates which enter into the formulation of the equations of motion of the train cars. The results obtained in this study showed that the neglect of the coupler inertia eliminates high frequency oscillations that can negatively impact the computational efficiency. The effect of these high frequencies that are attributed to the coupler inertia on the simulation time is examined using frequency and eigenvalue analyses. While the neglect of the coupler inertia leads, as demonstrated in this investigation, to a much more efficient model, the results obtained using the inertial and noninertial coupler models show good agreement, demonstrating that the coupler inertia can be neglected without having an adverse effect on the accuracy of the solutio...|$|R
