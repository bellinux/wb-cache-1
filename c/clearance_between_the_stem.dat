50|$|The {{valvetrain}} {{features a}} number of innovations: friction reducing roller swing arm, hydraulic lash adjusters which ensure proper <b>clearances</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> valve <b>stem</b> and roller swing arm, which significantly reduce valve tapping noise. The valve springs feature a beehive shape and smaller retainer. The reduced weight and spring load further help lower friction and improve fuel economy. The valvetrain is driven by a silent-type, maintenance free steel timing chain that replaces a roller-type timing chain: The optimized design greatly reduces impact forces and noise when the gear tooth and chain engage.|$|R

In order {{to clarify the}} mechanism of the gap on {{the sense of the}} noise, we estimated quantitatively the influence of assembly quality of the door mirror on the aerodynamic noise in the wind tunnel experiment. The aerodynamic noise of the door mirror is analyzed based on Curle’s equation using the characteristics of the wake structure. <b>The</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> panel of the body and base of the door mirror affects the noise level in the high frequency domain, whereas <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> base and visor influences the noise level in the low frequency domain.

40|$|Particle impact damping is {{measured}} for a cantilevered beam vibrating freely in the horizontal plane. Several particle configurations are investigated {{beginning with a}} single particle and progressing to multiple layers of particles. <b>The</b> effects of <b>clearance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> particles and enclosure, initial displacement of the primary system, repeatability of damping, and damping efficiency per unit mass added are evaluated for each particle configuration. The investigation shows that the particle configuration significantly affects damping. Configurations with the fewest particles per cavity demonstrate higher damping efficiency per unit mass. Generally, for configurations with a definable <b>clearance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> particles and enclosure, damping is {{shown to be a}} function of the clearance and initial system displacement.

40|$|Abstract. Tube bending is {{a complex}} process with multi-factor {{coupling}} effect and multiple defects occurring. The wall thinning, {{as one of the}} important defects in tube bending, determines the bending quality. In this study, taking thin-walled 6061 -T 4 Al-alloy tube with Φ 50. 8 ×t 0. 889 ×R 101. 6 mm (outer diameter D × wall thickness t × bending radius R) as the objective, the significance of processing parameters on the wall thinning degree is studied using the orthogonal test under ABAQUS/Explicit platform. The results show that: 1) the bending radius, <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tube and the pressure die, <b>the</b> friction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tube and the pressure die, <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tube and the pressure die, <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tube and the mandrel and <b>the</b> friction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tube and the mandrel affect the wall thinning significantly, while the coefficient of boost velocity, the number of mandrel balls, <b>the</b> friction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tube and the wiper die, the mandrel extension length and <b>the</b> friction <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tube and the bending die have little effect on the wall thinning degree...|$|R

40|$|The single screw {{compressor}} {{is used in}} many fields such as air compression, chemical industry and refrigeration. During operation, different gas pressures and temperatures applied on the components can cause different degrees of deformation, {{which leads to a}} difference <b>between</b> <b>the</b> thermally induced <b>clearance</b> and the designed clearance. However, limited research about clearance design is reported. In this paper, a temperature measurement instrument and a convective heat transfer model were described and used to establish the temperature of a single screw air compressor’s casing, screw rotor and star wheel. 3 -D models of these three main components were built. The gas force deformation, thermal-structure deformation and thermal-force coupling deformation were carried out by using a finite element simulation method. Results show that <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the groove and the top of star wheel is reduced by 0. 066 mm, <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> side of groove and the star wheel is reduced by 0. 015 mm, and <b>the</b> <b>clearance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> cylinder and the rotor is reduced by 0. 01 mm.
