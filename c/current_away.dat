25|$|Wolves' {{traditional}} away colours {{have been}} all-white, but recent decades {{have seen a}} variety of colours used; the <b>current</b> <b>away</b> kit is black with an old gold line pattern down the players left hand side. A third kit in a light blue colour is also used by Wolves.|$|E
25|$|Everton's {{traditional}} away colours {{were white}} shirts with black shorts, but from 1968 amber shirts and royal blue shorts became common. Various editions appeared throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Recently, black, white, grey and yellow away shirts have been used. The away shirt for the 2011–12 season was reverted to an amber shirt with navy blue shorts. The <b>current</b> <b>away</b> kit {{is a black}} shirt with an orange collar, while their third kit is a yellow shirt with blue trim.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{thoracic}} appendages resemble each other, but {{the first}} eleven pairs are best developed. There is a slight tendency to regional specialization and the first pair of legs is unlike the rest. It is an elongated, cheliped-like structure with a sensory function, while all the other appendages aid in feeding, respiration, and locomotion. In females, the eleventh pair of legs is modified into brood pouches. The many legs posterior to the eleventh pair move the spent feeding and respiratory <b>currents</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Knights lost {{head coach}} Tommi Suutari {{prior to the}} {{commencement}} of the 2007 season, as he {{had to return to}} Finland. Mike Harrow, who also played forward for the club, was appointed as head coach. Goaltenders were also changed, as Luke Fiveash became the Canberra Knights primary goalie, with Brad Hunt as a secondary. This season also saw the addition of Finnish imports Ari-Pekka Hakala, who {{went on to become the}} second highest scorer for the season, and Antti Teisala. During previous seasons the Knights were notorious for having very outdated and old away jerseys, but half way through the season there was a redesign, with the introduction of their <b>current</b> <b>away</b> jerseys.|$|E
25|$|Western Sydney Wanderers club colours are red and black.The club's colours {{as well as}} its inaugural season kit was {{announced}} on 25 June 2012, at a press conference held at Parramatta Stadium. The kit featured a red and black hoop jersey, white shorts and black socks. The red and black colour scheme was popular during the supporter forums, and the 'hoop design' emerged along with vertical stripes as the two most popular style choices. The club's second kit, worn when playing away from home, has the same hoop design as the home kit. The first away kit included a red and white jersey, black shorts and white socks. The team's <b>current</b> <b>away</b> kit features white and gray hoops with white shorts and socks.|$|E
500|$|The Liverpool away strip {{has more}} often than not been all yellow or white shirts and black shorts, but there have been several exceptions. An all grey kit was {{introduced}} in 1987, which was used until the 1991–92 centenary season, [...] when it was replaced by a combination of green shirts and white shorts. After various colour combinations in the 1990s, including gold and navy, bright yellow, black and grey, and ecru, the club alternated between yellow and white away kits until the 2008–09 season, when it re-introduced the grey kit. A third kit is designed for European away matches, though it is also worn in domestic away matches on occasions when the <b>current</b> <b>away</b> kit clashes with a team's home kit. [...] Between 2012–15, the kits were designed by Warrior Sports, who became the club's kit providers {{at the start of the}} 2012–13 season. In February 2015, Warrior's parent company New Balance announced it would be entering the global football market, with teams sponsored by Warrior now being outfitted by New Balance. The only other branded shirts worn by the club were made by Umbro until 1985, when they were replaced by Adidas, who produced the kits until 1996 when Reebok took over. They produced the kits for ten years before Adidas made the kits from 2006 to 2012.|$|E

50|$|Grounding {{the shaft}} by {{installing}} a grounding device provides an alternate low-impedance {{path from the}} motor shaft to the motor case.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} which combines the quantum trajectory approach to open quantum systems with a density-matrix renormalization group scheme for infinite one-dimensional lattice systems. We apply this method {{to investigate the}} long-time dynamics in the Bose-Hubbard model with local particle loss starting from a Mott-insulating initial state with one boson per site. While the short-time dynamics can be described even quantitatively by an equation of motion (EOM) approach at the mean-field level, many-body interactions lead to unexpected effects at intermediate and long times: local particle <b>currents</b> far <b>away</b> from the dissipative site start to reverse direction ultimately leading to a metastable state with a total particle <b>current</b> pointing <b>away</b> from the lossy site. An alternative EOM approach based on an effective fermion model shows that the reversal of currents can be understood qualitatively by the creation of holon-doublon pairs {{at the edge of}} the region of reduced particle density. The doublons are then able to escape while the holes move towards the dissipative site, a process reminiscent [...] -in a loose sense [...] -of Hawking radiation...|$|R

5|$|Volcanic ash plumes {{can form}} above {{pyroclastic}} density currents, these are called co-ignimbrite plumes. As pyroclastic density <b>currents</b> travel <b>away</b> from the volcano, smaller particles {{are removed from}} the flow by elutriation and form a less dense zone overlying the main flow. This zone then entrains the surrounding air and a buoyant co-ignimbrite plume is formed. These plumes tend to have higher concentrations of fine ash particles compared to magmatic eruption plumes due to the abrasion within the pyroclastic density current.|$|R
