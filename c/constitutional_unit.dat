A strong change in the polaronic absorption was observed during the doping, which after modeling revealed the existence of two separated transitions. The optical changes upon doping were additionally recorded using the SE technique. Similar to the results from FT-IR spectroscopy, two new in-the-gap absorptions were found. Moreover, the electrical conductivity {{as well as the}} mobility of positive carriers were measured. In the undoped state, the conductivity of the polymer was found to be below the detection limit (<S cm(- 1)), after doping the conductivity increased to 0. 69 S cm(- 1).

40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} history of the London Round Table group and of the Round Table {{magazine}} from their origins in 1909 - 10 until the decision to launch a "new" Round Table in 1966. It takes as its focus the ideas put forward by members of the group, in the Round Table and elsewhere, on a range of Imperial and international problems. It utilises knowledge on the authorship of Round Table articles in order to clarify the processes by which Round Table policy was made, and the role of different individuals within the group. It examines the rôle of the Round Table as a pressure group for Imperial reform and in particular its relationship to Empire federalism, seeking to elucidate {{the extent to which it}} was able to act coherently, and attempting to describe its aims, methods and influence. On the question of federalism, the thesis finds an inability to agree on details, but also a continuing belief in the necessity for <b>constitutional</b> <b>unit</b> until the late 1940 s. It suggests that this belief was not entirely unrealistic. The thesis argues that, despite differences of emphasis, the Round Table was able to develop a distinctive ideology of Imperialism which was strongly supportive of the Imperial rôle yet also responsive to the need for change. It finds that the group was only briefly influential on government policy, under Lloyd Georfge's administration, but it argues that the group saw its main purpose as that of influencing long-term opinion rather than short-term policy. It suggests that the group was able to play an important mediating rôle, between conservatism and radicalism, and between policy-making and opinion...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to explain the {{connecting}} logic of subjectivization in colonial intellects Joseon following the Sino-Japanese war, and the subsequent broadening effect the war had on it. The space called the continent, which the Japanese nation had newly acquired after the Sino-Japanese war, provided people in Joseon with the illusion of being able to remove the unequal relationship between the colony and the empire in the past. A group of colonial intellects took a strategy to try to acquire a <b>constitutional</b> <b>unit</b> inside the Japanese nation, which stood for a multi-national country. At the some time they wished to positively exclusively possess the ruling ideology of the empire, which was linked with Joseon such as the 'theory of Naeseonilche (內鮮一體) ' and the 'theory of Dongahyeopdongche (東亞協同體) ', which appeared following the Sino-Japanese war. The logic of subjectivization for the people of Joseon, who seemed to have fair post-colonial liberation from the colony, erupted into an imperial desire when being combined with a place called continent. This writing focuses attention on the experience of the battle line in the Hwanggun (皇軍) encouragement delegation, and to the rhetoric and cognitive characteristics in "Trip to War Front" by Park Yeong-hui and "Collection of Poems on the Battle Line" by Im Hak-su. A problem with the "pro-Japanese trend" in the so-called colonially literary circles, which was proceeded by cooperation with a system suggesting the possibility of subjectivization, was based on a fantasy of being able to acquire constitutional and political sovereignty in the Joseon society under a multi-national country. An opportunity, generalized by a sense that had a play in this factor. However, it necessay to consider the fact that this sense of liberation, which is seen to be fair from the position of the colonial people in Joseon, was another expression of pseudo-Imperialism, which was secured by joining the invasion into the continent. In the background of logic for subjectivization of people in Joseon following the Sino-Japanese war, two faces of Janus, the liberation of post-colonialism and the colonialism coexisted in this way. 本文主要以朝鮮知識份子探索朝鮮民族主體性的行動與地理移動兩者來說明。首先要探討的是，在中日戰爭後所形成的「內鮮一體論」，朝鮮文人特殊的談論方式以及在文章層面中所呈現的樣態，在此擬定義為以「殖民地－帝國」為背景所追求的「擬似－帝國主義」，並將該時期的新主體性納入帝國主體性(imperial subjectivity) 的範疇裡。「帝國主體性」是殖民地主要的周邊特性，它包含了動搖以及分裂的意識，而它也是一種擬似－帝國主義與殖民地模仿意識任意相互銜接的概念。朝鮮的知識份子於中日戰爭後，在日本帝國所宣傳的「普遍主義」的假象(Schein) 當中，為轉變成帝國主體(colonizer) 而形成了一種新的主體性。在這個轉變的過程當中，若要完整地瞭解擬似－帝國主義，就先要先分析探討當代文學中對帝國主體的誘惑與被殖民身份的覺醒所產生動搖與分裂的作品。而本文所要探討的是，殖民地文人的意識據點往中國大陸移動的情形，並發現當時文人作品的普遍意象幾乎毫無意外地、露骨地呈現對擬似－帝國主義的企圖心，同時也逐漸瓦解殖民地人民的分裂意識...|$|E

In polymer chemistry, end groups are functionalities or <b>constitutional</b> <b>units</b> that are at the extremity of a macromolecule or oligomer (IUPAC). [...] In polymer synthesis, like condensation polymerization and free-radical types of polymerization, end-groups are commonly used and can be analyzed for example by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine the average length of the polymer. Other methods for characterization of polymers where end-groups are used are mass spectrometry and vibrational spectrometry, like infrared and Raman spectrometry. Not only are these groups important for the analysis of the polymer, but they are also useful for grafting to and from a polymer chain to create a new copolymer. One example of an end group is in the polymer poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate where the end-groups are circled.|$|R

Polyelectrolytes are polymers whose repeating units bear an electrolyte group. Polycations and polyanions are polyelectrolytes. These groups dissociate in aqueous solutions (water), making the polymers charged. Polyelectrolyte properties are thus similar to both electrolytes (salts) and polymers (high molecular weight compounds) and are sometimes called polysalts. Like salts, their solutions are electrically conductive. Like polymers, their solutions are often viscous. Charged molecular chains, commonly present in soft matter systems, play {{a fundamental role in}} determining structure, stability and the interactions of various molecular assemblies. Theoretical approaches to describing their statistical properties differ profoundly from those of their electrically neutral counterparts, while technological and industrial fields exploit their unique properties. Many biological molecules are polyelectrolytes. For instance, polypeptides, glycosaminoglycans, and DNA are polyelectrolytes. Both natural and synthetic polyelectrolytes are used in a variety of industries.|$|R

FTIR spectra of PANI-SSA and PANI-DNSA show typical features of PANI conductive emeraldine salt segments. On the contrary, FTIR spectrum of PANI-GA shows absence of bands typical for conducting PANI polaronic lattice, and indicates the higher oxidation state of this polymer than that of emeraldine, the presence of substituted phenazines as <b>constitutional</b> <b>units,</b> as well as significant content of monosubstituted benzene rings which reflects low polymerization degree and/or pronounced chain branching.

40|$|Ethynylene and p-phenylene are {{frequently}} employed <b>constitutional</b> <b>units</b> in constructing {{the backbone of}} nanoscopic molecules with specific shape and mechanical or electronic function. How well these properties are defined depends on {{the flexibility of the}} backbone, which can be characterized via the end-to-end distance distribution. This distribution is accessible by pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) distance measurements between spin labels that are attached at the backbone. Four sets of oligomers with different sequences of p-phenylene and ethynylene units and different spin labels were prepared using polar tagging as a tool for simple isolation of the targeted compounds. By variation of backbone length, of the sequence of p-phenylene and ethynylene units, and of the spin labels a consistent coarse-grained model for backbone flexibility of oligo(p-phenyleneethynylene) s and oligo(p-phenylenebutadiynylene) s is obtained. The relation of this harmonic segmented chain model to the worm-like chain model for shape-persistent polymers and to atomistic molecular dynamics simulations is discussed. Oligo(p-phenylenebutadiynylene) s are found to be more flexible than oligo(p-phenyleneethynylene) s, but only slightly so. The end-to-end distance distribution measured in a glassy state of the solvent at a temperature of 50 K is found to depend on the glass transition temperature of the solvent. In the range between 91 and 373 K this dependence is in quantitative agreement with expectations for flexibility due to harmonic bending. For the persistence lengths at 298 K our data predict values of (13. 8 +/- 1. 5) nm for poly(p-phenyleneethynylene) s and of (11. 8 +/- 1. 5) nm for poly(p-phenylenebutadiynylene) s...|$|R

40|$|Societal constitutionalism {{presents}} us with {{alternatives to}} state-centered constitutional theory. But this alternative does {{not so much}} displace as extend conventional constitutional theory {{as a set of}} static premises that structure the organization of legitimate governance <b>units.</b> <b>Constitutional</b> theory, in either its conventional or societal forms, engages in both a descriptive and a normative project-the former looking to the incarnation of an abstraction and the later {{to the development of a}} set of presumptions and principles through which this incarnation can be judged. Constitutional theory is conventionally applied to states-that is, to those manifestations of organized power constituted by a group of individuals, bounded by a territory, and evidenced by the institution of government. But today a certain measure of disaggregation has managed to manifest a constituting power. Globalization has opened holes in the walls. that used to serve to police and protect states and their power authority. Societal aggregations can exist now between borders. Groups of individuals (and not just natural persons) incarnate abstractions of governance and then judge them in ways that are consonant with constitutional theory. These emerging realities have produced societal constitutionalism. But like conventional constitutionalism, societal constitutionalism seeks the comfort of equilibrium and stasis as the basic operating premises of self-constituting governance systems. This paper considers societal constitutionalism in its dynamic element-as a system structures constant adjustment among the constituting elements of a governance unit (whether state, corporation, religion, etc.) -in three dimensional governance space. After an introduction, Section I engages in framework setting, focusing on the structures of societal constitutionalism within the logic of globalization. Section II provides an illustration of a societally constituted enterprise operating in three dimensional dynamic governance space. Section III then develops the more important characteristics of this new dynamic and permeable constitutional framework.
