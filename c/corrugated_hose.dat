50|$|In addition, stripwound hoses {{are used}} for extracting and {{conveying}} substances such as smoke, shavings, granulate, etc. They are also suitable as protective hoses for corrugated lines to prevent over-extension and {{to act as a}} liner (guide hose inside a <b>corrugated</b> <b>hose)</b> to optimise flow conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} in {{creating}} a <b>corrugated</b> <b>hose</b> is to shape the starting metal strip from the coil into a smooth, longitudinally welded tube. The strip is continuously welded using the highly precise shielding gas welding method. Then the tube is corrugated {{by one of the}} following procedures: ...|$|E
50|$|The wing is an {{inflatable}} buoyancy bladder, {{similar to that}} in other varieties of BCD, except that it is not in or permanently attached to the harness part of a BCD. As with other BCDs, wings have an inflation valve on a <b>corrugated</b> <b>hose,</b> dump valve, and over pressure valve. Wings are usually oval (annular, doughnut or toroidal) or U-shaped (horseshoe), and are designed to wrap slightly around the diving cylinder(s) when inflated.|$|E
50|$|A {{metal hose}} is a {{flexible}} metal line element. There {{are two basic}} types of metal hose that differ in their design and application: stripwound <b>hoses</b> and <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses.</b> Stripwound hoses have a high mechanical strength (e.g. tensile strength and tear strength). <b>Corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> can withstand high pressure and provide maximum leak tightness on account of their material. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> also exhibit corrosion resistance and pressure tightness under the most extreme conditions, such as in aggressive seawater or at extreme temperatures such as found in space or when transporting cooled liquid gas. They are particularly well suited for conveying hot and cold substances.|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanical}} corrugation method, on {{the other}} hand, is used to produce both annular and helical <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses.</b> Usually, multiple profiled pressure rollers are positioned around the tube with an offset {{that enables them to}} roll the desired corrugation profile into the tube from the outside to the inside. Both corrugation methods cause material hardening and thus increase the pressure and fatigue resistance of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{hydraulic}} corrugation method {{expands the}} tube {{from the inside}} to the outside. This method is used to create annular <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>corrugated</b> <b>hose</b> of the {{inflator}} assembly {{should be}} {{long enough to}} easily dump air from the bladder and no longer, as this {{makes it difficult to}} streamline. The inflator mechanism must not be a high flow type. These use a non-standard connector, and can fill the wing dangerously quickly if the valve sticks open. It is easier to deal with a runaway inflation on a low flow rate inflator. A pull dump valve on the inflation manifold is an unnecessary additional point of failure.|$|E
50|$|To {{increase}} pressure resistance, metal hoses can {{be equipped}} with one- or two-layer braiding. The braiding is firmly connected to the hose fittings on both sides to absorb the longitudinal forces caused by internal pressure. Due to its inherent flexibility, the braid moulds itself perfectly to {{the movement of the}} hose. Hose braiding consists of right- and left-handed wrapped wire bundles that are alternately layered one over the other. This not only prevents hose lengthening due to internal pressure, but also absorbs external tensile forces and protects the outside of the hose. The basic material of the wire braid is usually {{the same as that of}} the <b>corrugated</b> <b>hose.</b> It is also possible to select different materials in the interest of greater corrosion resistance or for economic considerations.|$|E
40|$|Till Rolls was {{commissioned}} by the Towner Art Gallery Eastbourne specifically for the exhibition Compulsive, Obsessive, Repetitive (2011). ‘Till Roll’s’ is typical of Jill Townsley's practice; it is often large in scale, installation or temporary, though the physical labour applied to its construction is generally excruciatingly repetitive. She {{is interested in the}} subjective results of repetitive action, such as ‘failure', ‘temporality', ‘erasure' and 'authorship'. She generally uses everyday materials, such as, plastic spoons, broom bristles or staple wire. In this work she has used 10, 000 till roll’s, each of which has its middle extruded from the center, to form a tall vertical cone. Each cone differs in height, from very small to 3 meters (10 ft) high. Each roll is placed on the floor to form a giant grid; 5. 7 meters square. This structure is reminiscent of a graph, though we have no access to what it is recording. Compulsive, Obsessive, Repetitive, is a group show of sculptors who obsessively use small scale repetitive processes to create large scale installations. The exhibition comprises five new commissions by: Elpida Hadzi-Vasileva Brendan Jamison Susie MacMurray Jill Townsley Henry Seaton (Rex Henry and Graham Seaton) It also features an earlier work by Claire Morgan. These artists are motivated by the need to compulsively repeat an action – in a labour intensive and painstaking way - to create a large scale installation composed of multiple elements. From MacMurray’s sculptural drawing made from <b>corrugated</b> <b>hose</b> to Hadzi-Vasileva’s wall of salmon skins, individual elements are transformed through repetition into something {{more than the sum of}} its parts...|$|E
50|$|This {{increases}} process reliability during conduit {{assembly and}} use. For this reason, annular <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> {{are far more}} common, {{with only a few}} exceptions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> are {{pressure}} and vacuum tight. The permissible operating pressures for hoses with small dimensions reach 380 bar (with a 3-fold burst pressure safety factor). The pressure resistance of large dimensions is lower for technical reasons. Stainless steel models have a temperature resistance {{of up to}} approx. 600 °C, depending on the pressure load, and even higher values are possible with special materials. In the low temperature range, stainless steel <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> can be used down to -270 °C.|$|R
50|$|<b>Corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> {{are used}} as economical, {{flexible}} connecting elements that permit movement, thermal expansion and vibrations, {{and that can be}} used as filling hoses. The starting material is a seamless or longitudinally welded, thin-walled tube into which corrugations are introduced by mechanical or hydraulic means using special tools. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> are absolutely leak-tight and are used to convey liquids or gases under pressure or as vacuum lines. They are also referred to as pressure hoses. Their special design achieves both flexibility and pressure resistance.|$|R
40|$|Over 2 {{million workers}} are {{potentially}} exposed to respirable crystalline silica with {{the overwhelming majority}} in the construction industry. Occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica can lead to silicosis, lung cancer, and other adverse diseases. The present research evaluated novel designs in both traditional ventilation and local exhaust ventilation for a concrete dowel drill to reduce occupational exposures such as silica. The first study investigated traditional ventilation novel designs to increase capture velocities without increasing fan speeds or power consumption. The second and third study focused on improving a concrete dowel drill local exhaust ventilation design to reduce potential respirable crystalline silica exposures during large concrete construction project such as airport runways. Previous research indicated that the manufacturer’s local exhaust ventilation system reduced respirable crystalline silica exposures by over 90 percent but the system was susceptible to filter and hose clogging which reduced performance. In the second study, a laboratory study evaluated two novel local exhaust ventilation hoods, one commercially available hood, and the dowel drill manufacturer’s hood for hood efficiency and airflow characteristics. The novel design hoods increased hood coefficient of entry from 0. 59 for the manufacturer’s hood to 0. 64 indicating increased efficiency. Novel simple hood analysis found an average hood coefficient of entry of 0. 81 indicating further improvements can be made. In the third study, simulated workplace conditions were {{used to evaluate the}} best performance hood identified in laboratory testing along with other local exhaust ventilation modifications such as replacing the manufacturer’s <b>corrugated</b> <b>hose</b> with smooth-bore hose and including a cyclone pre-separator to reduce the dust transport burden within the exhaust system. The most effective local exhaust ventilation configuration consisted of the novel design hood, smooth-bore hose, and cyclone which reduced average accumulated hose weight (manufacturer’s configuration = 0. 3 pounds per trial vs. most effective configuration = 0. 05 pounds per trial) and increased average cleanout bucket capture (0. 95 pounds per trial to 6. 30 pounds per trial). These metrics indicated potential concrete dowel drill ventilation system efficiency and capture performance increases that address the ventilation system limitations indicated by previous research...|$|E
40|$|In North Canterbury, on the SE {{edge of the}} New Zealand plate {{boundary}} zone, deformation in late Cretaceous and younger cover rocks is complex. Detailed mapping of the cover sequence (which is about 1 km. thick), has revealed a pattern of synchronous faulting and folding about orthogonal E-ESE and N-NNE orientations younger than early Pleistocene. Complex and irregular basin and dome fold interference patterns are defined by distinctive limestone marker horizons, and partial star, triangular and <b>corrugated</b> <b>hose</b> fold surface geometries (defined by structure contours) are common. These geometries are often associated with folds that vary in shape along their hinge line and secondary folds developed oblique to the main interfering fold sets. Fold interference geometries are also characterised by composite conical geometries, composed of several distinct cone segments. Folding in the cover sequence has developed in response to: (1) fault propagation and displacement in the basement; and, (2) shortening within the fault bounded blocks. The folds related to faulting are asymmetric and parallel the major faults. Fold amplitudes of 0. 5 - 1. 6 km. are proportional to vertical fault displacements, and wavelengths of 5 - 20 km. are approximately equal to the strike-normal distances between the major faults. Fold interference patterns are indicative of the styles and levels of activity of the orthogonal faulting. Analysis of fault and slickenside striation geometries suggests that faulting is dominated by oblique-reverse faults and thrusts, which verge north, south, east and west. Interspersed with the regional contractional faulting are, local areas of E-ESE oblique-normal faults, inferred to be reactivated late Cretaceous structures. Computed stress tensors derived from minor fault motion {{data suggest that the}} principal stress axes most commonly plunge at shallow to moderate angles. Locally they have variable orientations but regionally these data imply a predominant NW-SE compression, comparable to local geodetic shortening and focal mechanism compression directions. Geometric and spatial analysis of large numbers of sets of small scale, mainly brittle structures, documents the local history of deformation. Multiple joint, pressure solution seam and stylolite, macrofracture and mesofault sets record only two periods of deformation since the mid-Cenozoic. The first was a weak regional mid-late Oligocene compression; the second involving a NW-SE compression since the Pliocene. Post Pliocene deformation is characterised by initial NW-SE shortening, followed by approximate N-S and E-W shortening associated with folding. The sequence of structural development during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene implies a progressive increase in the intensity of deformation and a rapid widening of the {{plate boundary}} zone during the last 2 - 3 ma. The mainly contractional deformation in North Canterbury, commonly associated with thrusting to the NW, is distinct from the major right-lateral and eastward directed thrust tectonics in Marlborough. This not only reflects a difference between inner and outer plate boundary deformation, but also the diminishing influence of subduction related tectonics...|$|E
40|$|Along {{the western}} {{margin of the}} Culverden Basin, North Canterbury, on the SE edge of the New Zealand plate {{boundary}} zone, deformation in Late Cretaceous and younger cover rocks has produced synchronous faulting and folding about orthogonal NNE-NE and WNW-NW orientations that are younger than early Pleistocene. The folds in the cover sequence are asymmetric, steeply inclined, gently plunging structures that are parallel to the major faults. Non-classical irregular basin and dome interference patterns are defined by prominent marker horizons, and triangular, <b>corrugated</b> <b>hose</b> and irregular T-shaped fold surface geometries (defined by structure contours) are common. The main folds, which vary in shape along their hinge line, have secondary folds developed at various angles to their axial trace. The major NNE-NE trending folds are characterised by composite conical geometries and are defined by several distinct cone segments. Folding in the cover rocks has developed in response to both fault propagation and displacement in the basement, and to shortening within the fault bounded blocks. The axial surfaces of the folds that parallel the faults are truncated by the propagating faults. Fault-related folds have half wavelengths of 1. 5 - 5 km and amplitudes of 0. 5 - 2. 4 km whilst folding within the fault bounded blocks have dimensions of 0. 5 - 1. 5 km and 0. 2 - 0. 6 km respectively. Meso scale faults, joints, calcite veins, fractures and pressure solution seams indicate two phases of post Late Cretaceous deformation: 1) a weak late Oligocene event related {{to the beginning of}} plate boundary inception, and 2) a post Pliocene phase related to widening of the plate boundary deformation during the last 2 - 3 ma. Analysis of fault and slickenside striation data suggests faulting is dominated by oblique-reverse faults and thrusts, which verge NW, SE and SW. Locally the stress and strain directions are variable but generally imply a predominant NW-SE compression comparable to local geodetic shortening and focal mechanism compression directions. Principal incremental shortening axes and stress tensors suggest the shortening and compression directions plunge gently to horizontally NW-SE but can switch with the intermediate stress to NE-SW. Movement planes tend to be less conclusive, often showing girdle distributions of M-plane intersections. Interspersed with the regional contractional faulting are local areas of oblique-normal NNE and normal faults indicating strain partitioning. Late Holocene terraces incised into older Pleistocene aggradation gravels are dated by weathering rinds and document deformation. Two seismically triggered landslides and a ground rupture event of the Balmoral Fault appear to have occurred during the same seismic event, approximately 1700 years B. P. A magnitude 6. 5 + event necessary to produce ground rupture and the landslides would cause both local, and possibly regional, destruction. The main contractional deformation along the western margin of the Culverden Basin, commonly associated with thrusting to the southeast is atypical of North Canterbury structure, is distinct from the right-lateral tectonics of Marlborough and marks a transition between the inner and outer plate boundary zones and subduction related tectonics...|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two basic}} {{variants}} of <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> that differ in their type of corrugation: annular corrugation and helical corrugation. In hoses with helical corrugation, usually a right-handed coil with a constant pitch that runs along the whole length of the hose.The annular corrugation, on the other hand, consists {{of a large number}} of equally-spaced parallel corrugations whose main plane is perpendicular to the hose axis. Hoses with annular corrugation have decided advantages over those with helical corrugation: ...|$|R
50|$|In addition, <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> can be {{manufactured}} {{by a special}} method that {{is closely related to}} the manufacture of stripwound hoses. In this procedure, the starting strip is given a corrugated profile in a longitudinal direction. This profile strip is then wound helically and the overlapping coils are tightly welded along the helical seam. After corrugation, the hose may be equipped with a braided sheath (see below). In this case, the hose then passes through a braiding machine that has circumferential wire coil holders, or so-called bobbins.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{variant of}} the metal hose {{can be attributed to}} the inventor Siegfried Frank of Frankfurt, Germany. In 1894, he patented the method of rolling a helical corrugation into a smooth rigid pipe. Heinrich Witzenmann had already made experiments in this direction several years earlier, but did not continue his efforts to create a patentable result. It wasn't until the twenties and thirties of the 20th century that the hotel administrator Albert Dreyer of Lucerne, Switzerland, succeeded in creating a satisfactory annular corrugation for the manufacture of metal <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{flexibility}} of the hose is achieved {{by means of the}} elastic behaviour of the corrugation profile. When the hose is bent, the outer corrugations separate while the inner corrugations are squeezed together. The flexibility, bending behaviour and pressure stability of <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> depend on the selected profile shape. While flexibility increases with an increase in profile height and a decrease in corrugation spacing, pressure resistance decreases. The frequently required semi-flexible bending behaviour is achieved by flat profiles. Depending {{on the use of the}} hose, special application-specific profile shapes can be implemented ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we propose an {{efficient}} method to compute the friction factor of helically <b>corrugated</b> <b>hoses</b> carrying flow at high Reynolds numbers. A comparison between computations of several turbulence models is made with experimental results for corrugation sizes that fall outside the range of validity of the Moody diagram. To do this efficiently we implement quasi-periodicity. Using the appropriate boundary conditions and matching body force, we only need to simulate a single period of the corrugation to find the friction factor for fully developed flow. A second technique is introduced by {{the construction of an}} appropriately twisted wedge, which allows us to furthermore reduce the problem by a further dimension while accounting for the Beltrami symmetry that is present in the full three-dimensional problem. We make a detailed analysis of the accuracy and timesaving that this novelty introduces. We show that the swirl inside the flow, which is introduced by the helical boundary, has a positive effect on the friction factor. Furthermore, we give a prediction for which corrugation angles the assumption of axisymmetry is no longer valid. It then has to make place for Beltrami-symmetry if accurate results are required...|$|R

The demand valve component of a two-stage twin hose regulator is thus mounted in the same housing as the first stage regulator, {{and in order to}} prevent free-flow, the exhaust valve must be located at the same depth as the diaphragm, and the only reliable place to do this is in the same housing. The air flows through a pair of <b>corrugated</b> rubber <b>hoses</b> to and from the mouthpiece.

The exhaust hose is used to return the exhaled air to the regulator, to avoid pressure differences due to depth variation between the exhaust valve and final stage diaphragm, which would cause a free-flow of gas, or extra resistance to breathing, depending on the diver's orientation in the water.

The Demone Mark I and Demone Mark II are both two-stage regulators. The second-stage looks like the mouthpiece of a twin-hose regulator but has a small diaphragm on the front. The second-stage valve is inside the mouthpiece tube. The exhaled air goes into a <b>corrugated</b> coaxial exhaust <b>hose</b> which surrounds the intermediate-pressure hose and discharges about 60% of {{the way back to}} the first-stage to keep the bubbles away from the diver's face.

40|$|The work {{presented}} {{contributes to}} the LNG supply chain {{by the development of}} a validated calculation model for <b>corrugated</b> flexible <b>hoses</b> or pipes developed for LNG Transfer. The model builds upon experience gained by TNO Technical Sciences (Fluid Dynamics) in a large number of flow tests carried out on hoses in a large range of diameters from 4 to 18 -inch. LNG transfer rates are in general relatively high as the time involved should be limited from economical point of view. In large scale offshore LNG transfer, flow rates up to 5000 m 3 /h are applied and in future flow rates up to 10. 000 m 3 /h are foreseen. Typical values mentioned for offshore operations in tandem transfer range from 50 to 150 meters hose length and hose diameter up to 20 -inch. The pressure losses in LNG offshore transfer, but also in smaller scale applications, can be considerable. The pressure loss depends on flow rate, length of the hose, internal diameter and internal hose corrugation geometry. High pressure losses will impose additional requirements on LNG pumps and might result in cavitation at the downstream end of the hose as the average pressure drops below vapor pressure. Furthermore the impact of local boiling phenomena due to heat-ingress and cavitation, possibly effected by vortex shedding along the internal corrugations, is not known. Once the gaps in the data base are filled a validated prediction model is available, which can be used in guidelines and standards. So far the EN 1474 (part 2 : Design and testing of transfer hoses) does not specify a maximum allowable pressure loss and the prescription of the requirement for the test is limited: "Flow rate testing (ambient or cryogenic) : demonstrate that the hose is capable of operating at its maximum flow rate and confirm the predicted head loss " The final goal of the project is to obtain a validated prediction model for the calculation of pressure losses in LNG transfer with flexible multi-composite and metal hoses based on input of parameters as operating conditions and hose geometry. Also input for guidelines and standards in LNG transfer with flexibles such as EN 1474 will be generated, which can be used in for qualification of LNG equipment...|$|R
