40|$|Chloride {{penetration}} is {{the main}} cause of corrosion in reinforced concrete (RC) structures located in marine environments. The deterioration could possibly cause severe cracking at concrete surfaces. This study investigates the effect of reinforcement confinement (including transverse reinforcement) and spacing of reinforcing bars on concrete cover cracking using accelerated corrosion tests. These tests have become the most satisfactory method used in the laboratory to accelerate and simulate the corrosion process. The accelerated corrosion test adopts an electrochemical technique, which involves the application of alternating current. In this study, corrosion was induced along the deformed bars by adding calcium chloride into a concrete mixture. The experiment concentrated only on reinforcement <b>confinement</b> and <b>spacing</b> of reinforcing bars to measure corrosion-induced crack width and rate of crack propagation.

The first images of the House were released in late May and showed the kitchen, living area, bathroom, {{one of the two}} bedrooms, and parts of the garden. The initial set of pictures revealed a lavish, Romanesque bathroom and a red kitchen fitted with triangular furniture and wall slats facing inwards, The bedroom shown (which the housemates nicknamed [...] "B-Block") contains only eight beds surrounded by lockers and the garden was enlarged with vibrant colours and an ashtray in which housemates may smoke. The dining table had only eight seats when first shown to the public; it was later shown during the launch that there was a second adjoining table.On 4 June 2008, only one day before the launch of the series, Channel 4 released images of the luxury bedroom {{and for the first time}} before the launch show in the programme's history, the Diary Room. The luxury bedroom was accessed via the garden and contains eight double beds with an oval wardrobe built into the back. The Diary Room was in between the two sets of stairs by which housemates entered and exited the House (they join together at the top). This meant that the housemates had to exit the House through the main doorway to enter the Diary Room; however, the Diary Room button that the housemates used to notify Big Brother of their intent to go to the Diary Room was located next to the main door inside the House. Outside the bathroom were tokens, which housemates bought from the shopping list and gave to Big Brother if they wanted to use hot water or get rewards. The tokens were not returned afterwards. When the house was split into Heaven and Hell, the garden had to be modified, with a new outside bathroom in [...] "hell" [...] and the seating area in heaven was located as the smoking area.Other areas in the House included, for the first time, a jail for housemates who break the rules.

40|$|Tiny {{concentrations}} of suspended particles may alter {{the behavior of}} an evaporating droplet remarkably, leading to partially viscous and partially elastic dynamical characteristics. This, in turn, may lead to some striking mechanical instabilities, such as buckling and rupture. Here, we report certain non-trivial implications of the consequent morpho-dynamics (macro to nano scales), when such an evaporating droplet is encapsulated in a confined environment. Compared to unconfined scenario, we report non-intuitive suppression of rupturing beyond a critical confinement. We attribute this to confinement-induced dramatic alteration in the evaporating flux, leading to distinctive spatiotemporal characteristics of the internal flow leading to preferential particle transport and subsequent morphological transitions. We present a regime map quantifying buckling-non buckling pathways. These results {{may turn out to}} be of profound importance towards achieving desired morphological features of a colloidal droplet, by aptly tuning the <b>confinement</b> <b>space,</b> initial particle concentration, as well as the initial droplet volume...|$|E

40|$|The most {{powerful}} method for protein structure determination is X-ray crystallography which {{relies on the}} availability of high quality crystals. Obtaining protein crystals is a major bottleneck, and inducing their nucleation is of crucial importance in this field. An effective method to form crystals is to introduce nucleation-inducing heterologous materials into the crystallization solution. Porous materials are exceptionally effective at inducing nucleation. It is shown here that a combined diffusion-adsorption effect can increase protein concentration inside pores, which enables crystal nucleation even under conditions where heterogeneous nucleation on flat surfaces is absent. Provided the pore is sufficiently narrow, protein molecules approach its walls and adsorb more frequently than they can escape. The decrease in the nucleation energy barrier is calculated, exhibiting its quantitative dependence on the <b>confinement</b> <b>space</b> and the energy of interaction with the pore walls. These results provide a detailed explanation of the effectiveness of porous materials for nucleation of protein crystals, and will be useful for optimal design of such materials...|$|E

The S/R system uses a vehicle to move the special nuclear material that are placed on the pallets from the storage bins to input/output (I/O) stations and vice versa. As the name suggest the I/O stations are used to place the material into the S/R vault or to remove material from the S/R vault. The pallets are specially designed structures that will hold certain numbers of the material containers in a safe configuration. To store additional material containers, {{there is a need to}} insert additional pallets in the SIR vault. Due to the presence of radioactive contamination and the fact that the vault must be kept at a negative pressure at all times, one of the several I/O stations will be modified so that pallets could be inserted into the S/R vault. The ventilation system for the S/R area is a dedicated system that recirculates nitrogen with less than 5 % oxygen by volume throughout the area while exhausting small option of the nitrogen to keep the S/R at negative 1 inches w. c. relative to the atmosphere. The rooms surrounding the G/H and the S/R area are maintained at negative of 0. 3 inches w. c. relative to the outside atmosphere.

When the total energy, which {{is composed of}} a kinetic part and a geometrical part describing the balance between attraction and repulsion forces, is below a certain threshold, then {{it is known that}} the agents will converge to a dynamics where mutual <b>space</b> <b>confinement</b> is guaranteed. In this paper we question the construction of a stabilization strategy, which requires the minimal amount of external intervention for never-theless inducing <b>space</b> <b>confinement,</b> also when the initial energy threshold is violated. Our main result establishes that if the initial energy exceeds the threshold mainly because of its kinetic component, then a sparse control instantaneously applied with enough strength on the most rowdy agent (i. e., with maximal speed) will be able to steer in finite time the system to an energy level under the threshold.

In this study, {{we compare}} the hetero-junction effects on optical characteristics of TiO 2 nanotube arrays for the cases with AAO stayed intact and after AAO was etched away selectively. Due to the <b>space</b> <b>confinement</b> effect that can occur only in the TiO 2 /AAO nanotubes, the photoluminance intensity of TiO 2 material is enhanced about 5 times for TiO 2 /AAO nanotubes compared with the TiO 2 nanotubes. On the contrary, under 0 V bias, quantum efficiency of the TiO 2 /AAO nanotubes is 5. 8 times lower than the TiO 2 nanotubes because of higher probability for the recombination of photon-generated electron-hole pairs from the <b>space</b> <b>confinement</b> effect in TiO 2 /AAO nanotube arrays. When the bias reached 1 V, the TiO 2 nanotubes still revealed more outstanding photon-to-electron transformation properties than the TiO 2 /AAO nanotubes. However, the quantum efficiency of TiO 2 /AAO nanotubes began to exceed TiO 2 nanotubes when the bias is over 2 V. This phenomenon could result from the restraint of the recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs under high field strength {{and the increase in}} an amount of photo-generated carriers injected from AAO template...|$|R

30|$|Enhancement of the Soret band {{occurs in}} the case of the {{sandwich}} Au/TPP/Au system. This phenomenon is of similar nature to the case of Au/TPP films, and it is related to photon-plasmon conversion. However, in this case, a suppression of one of the two luminescence maxima in luminescence spectra is evident. According to the semi-classical Franck-Condon principle, two luminescence peaks appear due to transition of excited energy from the TPP’s lowest vibration excited state to two vibration states of TPP in the ground state. When TPP is sandwiched between Au layers, one of these radiative transitions is suppressed and the second luminescence peak increases approximately twice. It indicates that the excited TPP molecule can return to only one vibration ground state. We propose that one of the TPP’s vibration states is partially forbidden due to <b>space</b> <b>confinement</b> of the TPP layer by Au layers.|$|R
