40|$|This study {{utilised}} {{a survey}} methodology; soliciting teachers’ perceptions of <b>classroom</b> behaviour <b>management,</b> probing {{their sense of}} confidence, defining strategies used and professional development experiences. High attrition rates {{in the first five}} years of teaching appear largely attributable to emotional exhaustion relating to a perception of an inability to cope with behavioural challenges within the classroom. There are many studies focused on this emotional exhaustion and extensive studies and theories regarding behavioural problems in students. This study, however aimed to provide data on a largely overlooked gap in understanding teachers' perspectives on <b>classroom</b> behaviour <b>management.</b> How confident teachers feel, which strategies they believe useful and additionally the desirability of professional development in this area. A response was received from 200 teachers of year 1 to year 4 classes. Of these 200 teachers, 110 completed the entire survey and it is these responses that this study is based on. The results of this survey indicate a requirement for a comprehensive <b>classroom</b> behaviour <b>management</b> programme to be utilised (particularly for teacher trainees). This type of training can assist in ensuring that positive reinforcing skills and strategies are enabled to provide the best possible learning environment for students and teacher alike...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a one-year follow-up study of Australian beginning primary teachers' perceived preparedness to manage a variety of problematic student behaviours, and their confidence and use of behaviour management strategies based on their preservice coursework in <b>classroom</b> behaviour <b>management.</b> A total of 216 primary teachers in their first year of employment located across Australia responded to the online survey. Based on their coursework preparation in <b>classroom</b> behaviour <b>management,</b> the first-year teachers felt, at best, only somewhat prepared to manage disruption, noncompliance and disorganisation problems, and closer to not at all prepared to manage aggressive, antisocial, or destructive behaviours. Their perceptions of preparedness to manage all categories of problem behaviours had decreased significantly since course completion in the past year.

25|$|Educational {{psychology}} can in part {{be understood}} through {{its relationship with}} other disciplines. It is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous {{to the relationship between}} medicine and biology. It is also informed by neuroscience. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including instructional design, educational technology, curriculum development, organizational learning, special education, <b>classroom</b> <b>management,</b> and student motivation. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks.|$|E
25|$|Improving the {{surrounding}} {{home and school}} environment can improve the behavior of children with ADHD. Parents of children with ADHD often show similar deficits themselves, and thus {{may not be able}} to sufficiently help the child with his or her difficulties. Improving the parents' understanding of the child's behavior and teaching them strategies to improve functioning and communication and discourage unwanted behavior has measurable effect on the children with ADHD. The different educational interventions for the parents are jointly called Parent Management Training. Techniques include operant conditioning: a consistent application of rewards for meeting goals and good behavior (positive reinforcement) and punishments such as time-outs or revocation of privileges for failing to meet goals or poor behavior. <b>Classroom</b> <b>management</b> is similar to parent management training; educators learn about ADHD and techniques to improve behavior applied to a classroom setting. Strategies utilized include increased structuring of classroom activities, daily feedback, and token economy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Classroom</b> {{behaviour}} <b>management</b> is {{an essential}} skill required by all teacher graduates to facilitate instruction in curriculum content. This article describes the <b>classroom</b> behaviour <b>management</b> (CBM) content on offer in Australian undergraduate primary education programs. To date, no nationwide studies exist that report the CBM instruction on offer in pre-service teacher education programs. Thirty-five primary teacher preparation programs were reviewed. Thirty programs (85. 7 %) contained mandatory course-work in CBM, 108 units contained relevant content, 33 of those were stand-alone CBM units (30. 6 %). More units were found with CBM content embedded within methods or inclusion units than stand-alone CBM units. The mean hours of CBM instruction per mandatory stand-alone unit was 31. 46 hours, 25. 5 for stand-alone electives, and 2. 3 hours within embedded units.

2500|$|Behavioral {{interventions}} {{also have}} a fairly strong evidence base in impulse control disorders. In ADHD, the behavioral interventions of behavioral parent training, behavioral <b>classroom</b> <b>management,</b> and intensive peer-focused behavioral interventions in recreational settings meet stringent guidelines qualifying them for evidence based treatment status. In addition, a recent meta-analysis of evidence-based ADHD treatment found organization training to be a well-established treatment method. Empirically validated behavioral treatments for substance use disorder are fairly similar across substance use disorders, and include behavioral couples therapy, CBT, contingency management, motivational enhancement therapy, and relapse prevention. [...] Pyromania and kleptomania are understudied (due {{in large part to}} the illegality of the behaviors), though there is some evidence that psychotherapeutic interventions (CBT, short term counseling, day treatment programs) are efficacious in treating pyromania, while kleptomania seems to be best impacted using SSRIs. [...] Additionally, therapies including CBT, family therapy, and social skill training have shown positive effects on explosive aggressive behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|Consultation is an {{important}} part of a school psychologist’s career because it allows school psychologists to reach more children than using direct intervention techniques. Consultation is usually thought of as a triadic relationship with the school psychologist working with another individual in hopes of helping change many students behaviors/grades [...] The individual that school psychologists usually work with during consultation is a parent or teacher. School psychologists consult with parents to address learning and behavioral problems at home that can interfere with school progress. More frequently though school psychologists work with teachers during consultation to reach the many students in their classrooms. School psychologists mainly consult teachers on developing and implementing <b>classroom</b> <b>management</b> techniques and implementing specific interventions for specific students. School psychologists also now consult with administrators on a systems-level. When working on a systems level, school psychologists generally do not just work with one person but instead works with multiple individuals to make changes and help students on a more broad level. This can be to develop school wide programs to combat bullying or improve the entire school’s reading program.|$|E
2500|$|At the Düsseldorf Academy of Art, Beuys did {{not impose}} his artistic style or {{techniques}} on his students; in fact, he kept {{much of his}} work and exhibitions hidden from the classroom because he wanted his students to explore their own interests, ideas, and talents. Beuys' actions were somewhat contradictory: while he was extremely strict about certain aspects of <b>classroom</b> <b>management</b> and instruction, such as punctuality {{and the need for}} students to take draughtsmanship classes, he encouraged his students to freely set their own artistic goals without having to prescribe to set curricula. Another aspect of Beuys' pedagogy included open “ring discussions,” where Beuys and his students discussed political and philosophical issues of the day, including the role of art, democracy, and the university in society. Some of Beuys' ideas espoused in class discussion and in his art-making included free art education for all, the discovery of creativity in everyday life, and the belief that “everyone [...] an artist.” Beuys himself encouraged peripheral activity and all manner of expression to emerge during the course of these discussions. While some of Beuys' students enjoyed the open discourse of the Ringgesprache, others, including Palermo and Immendorf, disapproved of the classroom disorder, anarchic characteristics, eventually rejecting his methods and philosophies altogether.|$|E

2500|$|Dewey’s passions for teaching—a natural {{love for}} working with young children, a natural {{propensity}} to inquire about the subjects, methods and other social {{issues related to the}} profession, and a desire to share this acquired knowledge with others—are not a set of outwardly displayed mechanical skills. [...] Rather, they may be viewed as internalized principles or habits which “work automatically, unconsciously” (Dewey, 1904, p.15). [...] According to Dewey, teacher education programs must turn away from focusing on producing proficient practitioners because such practical skills related to instruction and discipline (e.g. creating and delivering lesson plans, <b>classroom</b> <b>management,</b> implementation of an assortment of content-specific methods) can be learned over time during their everyday school work with their students (Dewey, PST, 2010). [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "The teacher who leaves the professional school with power in managing a class of children may appear to superior advantage the first day, the first week, the first month, or even the first year, as compared with some other teacher who has a much more vital command of the psychology, logic and ethics of development. [...] But later ‘progress’ may with such consist only in perfecting and refining skill already possessed. [...] Such persons seem to know how to teach, but they are not students of teaching. [...] Even though they go on studying books of pedagogy, reading teachers’ journals, attending teachers’ institutes, etc., yet the root of the matter is not in them, unless they continue to be students of subject-matter, and students of mind-activity. [...] Unless a teacher is such a student, he may continue to improve in the mechanics of school management, but he cannot grow as a teacher, an inspirer and director of soul-life" [...] (Dewey, 1904, p.15). [...] For Dewey, teacher education should focus not on producing persons who know how to teach as soon as they leave the program; rather, teacher education should be concerned with producing professional students of education who have the propensity to inquire about the subjects they teach, the methods used, and the activity of the mind as it gives and receives knowledge. [...] According to Dewey, such a student is not superficially engaging with these materials, rather, the professional student of education has a genuine passion to inquire about the subjects of education, knowing that doing so ultimately leads to acquisitions of the skills related to teaching. [...] Such students of education aspire for the intellectual growth within the profession that can only be achieved by immersing one’s self in the lifelong pursuit of the intelligence, skills and character Dewey linked to the profession.|$|E
