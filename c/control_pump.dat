40|$|We {{employ the}} process of {{non-degenerate}} four-wave mixing Bragg scattering (FWM-BS) to demonstrate all-optical control in a silicon platform. In our configuration, a strong, non-information-carrying pump is mixed with a weak <b>control</b> <b>pump</b> and an input signal in a silicon-on-insulator waveguide. Through the optical nonlinearity of this highly-confining waveguide, the weak pump controls the wavelength conversion process from the signal to an idler, leading to a controlled depletion of the signal.

Traditionally management relies on groundwater to meeting rising demand by increasing supply, but climate uncertainty and population growth require more judicious management to achieve efficiency and sustainability. Over-pumping leads to groundwater overdraft and jeopardizes the ability of future users to demand on the resource. Optimal urban groundwater pumping {{can play a role}} in solving this conundrum.

5000|$|While the {{majority}} of these pumps mount nearest to the hot water heater and have no adjustable temperature capabilities, a significant reduction in energy can be achieved by using a temperature adjustable thermostatically <b>controlled</b> circulation <b>pump</b> mounted at the last fixture on the loop. Thermostatically <b>controlled</b> circulation <b>pumps</b> allow owners to choose the desired temperature of hot water to be maintained within the hot water pipes since most homes do not require [...] degree water instantly out of their taps. Thermostatically <b>controlled</b> circulation <b>pumps</b> cycle on and off to maintain a user's chosen temperature and consume less energy than a continuously operating pump. By installing a thermostatically <b>controlled</b> <b>pump</b> just after the farthest fixture on the loop, cyclic pumping maintains ready hot water up to the last fixture on the loop instead of wasting energy heating the piping from the last fixture to the water heater. Often installing a circulation pump at the farthest fixture on hot water circulation loop due to limited available space, cosmetics, noise restrictions or lack of available power. Recent advancements in hot water circulation technology allow for benefiting from temperature <b>controlled</b> <b>pumping</b> without having to install the pump at the last fixture on the hot water loop. These advanced hot water circulation systems utilize a water contacting temperature probe strategically installed at the last fixture on the loop to minimize the energy wasted heating lengthy return pipes. Thermal insulation applied to the pipes helps mitigate this second loss and minimize the amount of water that must be pumped to keep hot water constantly available.|$|R

40|$|With {{respect to}} rotary blood pumps used as left {{ventricular}} assist devices (LVADs), it is clinically important to <b>control</b> <b>pump</b> flow to avoid complications associated with over-or under-pumping {{of the native}} heart. By employing only the non-invasive observer of instantaneous pump impeller speed to assess flow dynamics, a number of physiologically significant pumping states may be detected. Based {{on a number of}} acute animal experiments, five such states were identified: regurgitant pump flow (PR), ventricular ejection (VE), non-opening of the aortic valve (ANO), and partial collapse (intermittent and continuous) of the ventricle wall (PVC-I and PVC-C). Two broader states, normal (corresponding to VE, ANO) and suction (corresponding to PVC-I, PVC-C) were readily discernable in clinical data from human patients implanted with LVADs. Based on data from both the animal experiments (N= 6) and the human patients (N= 10), a strategy for the automated non-invasive detection of significant pumping states has been developed and validated. Employing a classification and regression tree (CART), this system detects pumping states {{with a high degree of}} accuracy: state VE - 87. 5 / 100. 0 % (sensitivity/specificity); state ANO - 98. 1 / 92. 5 %; state PVC-I - 90. 0 / 90. 2 %; state PVC-C - 61. 2 / 98. 0 %.
