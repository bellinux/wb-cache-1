40|$|The {{present study}} {{presents}} an experiment to investigate 1) whether judged fluency correlates with judged accuracy of consecutive interpreting performance; and 2) {{whether and how}} judged fluency can be predicted {{on the basis of}} acoustic measures such as automatically calculated temporal measures of speech quality. In the experiment, ten raters judged six major quality measures related to accuracy and fluency of the consecutive interpreting performance (in this study from Chinese into English) recorded from seven BA trainees and five MA trainees based on the same recorded source speech. Six <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpretations</b> per participants were recorded, two of which were analyzed acoustically by means of the speech analysis tool PRAAT. The pauses detected by PRAAT and the disfluencies transcribed and labeled manually were automatically counted by the text analysis computer program of AWK, based on which 12 acoustic measures of fluency were calculated. The results show that 1) there is a strong positive correlation between judged accuracy and judged fluency in consecutive interpreting; 2) there are strong correlations between judged fluency and objective acoustic measures of fluency in consecutive interpreting; and 3) effective speech rate appears to be the best predictor of judged fluency in consecutive interpreting. The other important determinants of judged interpreting fluency are number of filled pauses, articulation rate, and mean length of pause. The results have practical implications for both developing an automatic assessment tool of fluency facilitating consecutive interpreting testing as well as for consecutive interpreting pedagogy...|$|R

A consistent {{system for}} taking notes in consecutive interpreting {{is essential for}} an interpreter {{and at the same}} time, {{one of the most difficult}} tasks to develop. Some professionals affirm that note-taking cannot be taught and that everyone must come up with their own system. Therefore many instructors allow their students to develop a system which will not present effective solutions to the problems they may find. Consequently, most students of interpreting fail to acquire an effective system of note-taking. The aim of this essay is to improve the note-taking techniques acquired throughout the degree in “Translation and Interpreting”. This essay presents several exercises whose goal is to achieve the aims previously described. To begin with, there is a general overview of the characteristics of consecutive interpreting and, more specifically, the note-taking technique.

40|$|This study aims at {{exploring}} listeners’ perception of disfluencies, i. e. ungrammatical pauses, filled pauses, repairs, false starts and repetitions, which can irritate listeners and impede comprehension. As professional communicators, conference interpreters should be competent public speakers. This means that their speech should be easily understood by listeners and not contain elements {{that may be}} considered irritating. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand to what extent listeners notice disfluencies and consider them irritating, and to examine whether there are differences between interpreters and non-interpreters and between different age groups. A survey was therefore carried out among professional interpreters, students of interpreting and people who regularly attend conferences. The respondents were asked to answer a questionnaire after listening to three speeches: three <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpretations</b> delivered during the final exams held at the Advanced School of Languages, Literature, Translation and Interpretation (SSLLTI) in Forlì. Since conference interpreters’ public speaking skills should be at least as good as those of the speakers at a conference, the speeches were presented to the listeners as speeches delivered during a conference, with no mention of interpreting being made. The study is divided into five chapters. Chapter I outlines the characteristics of the interpreter as a professional communicator. The quality criterion “user-friendliness” is explored, with a focus on features that make a speech more user-friendly: fluency, intonation, coherence and cohesion. The Chapter also focuses on listeners’ quality expectations and evaluations. In Chapter II the methodology of the study is described. Chapter III contains a detailed analysis of the texts used for the study, focusing on those elements that may irritate listeners or impede comprehension, namely disfluencies, the wrong use of intonation and a lack of coherence or cohesion. Chapter IV outlines the results of the survey, while Chapter V presents our conclusions. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{quantify}} {{the changes in}} reader performance levels, if any, during interpretation of computed tomographic (CT) colonographic data when a computer-aided detection (CAD) system {{is used as a}} second or concurrent reader. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After institutional review board approval was obtained, 16 experienced radiologists searched for polyps in 112 patients, 56 of whom had 132 polyps. Each case was interpreted on three separate occasions by using an unassisted (without CAD), second-read CAD, or concurrent CAD reading paradigm. The reading paradigm and case order were randomized, with a minimal interval of 1 month between <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpretations.</b> The readers' findings were compared with the reference-truth interpretation. The mean per-patient sensitivity and mean per-patient specificity with CAD were compared with those achieved with unassisted reading. An increase in per-patient sensitivity was considered to be clinically more important than an equivalent decrease in specificity. RESULTS: The mean per-patient sensitivity for identification of patients with polyps of any size increased significantly with use of second-read CAD (mean increase, 7. 0 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 4. 0 %, 9. 8 %) and concurrent CAD (mean increase, 4. 5 %; 95 % CI: 0. 8 %, 8. 2 %). The mean per-patient specificity did not decrease significantly with use of second-read CAD (mean decrease, - 2. 5 %; 95 % CI: - 5. 2 %, 0. 1 %) or concurrent CAD (mean decrease, - 2. 2 %; 95 % CI: - 4. 6 %, 0. 2 %). With analysis restricted to patients with polyps 6 mm or larger, the benefit in sensitivity with second-read CAD remained (mean increase, 7. 1 %; 95 % CI: 3. 0 %, 11. 1 %), whereas the increase with concurrent CAD was not significant (mean increase, 4. 2 %; 95 % CI: - 0. 5 %, 8. 9 %). Use of second-read CAD significantly increased the per-polyp sensitivity for polyps 6 mm or larger (mean increase, 9. 0 %; 98. 3 % CI: 4. 9 %, 12. 8 %) and polyps 5 mm or smaller (mean increase, 5. 9 %; 98. 3 % CI: 3. 2 %, 9. 1 %), but use of concurrent CAD increased the per-polyp sensitivity for only those polyps 5 mm or smaller (mean increase, 4. 8 %; 98. 3 % CI: 2. 2 %, 7. 9 %). CONCLUSION: Use of second-read CAD significantly improves readers' per-patient and per-polyp detection. Concurrent CAD is less effective. SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In Italy, {{in recent}} years, {{interest}} in sign language interpretation has gradually gained ground. Some twenty years ago, {{it was a}} skill performed by {{only a small number}} of people related in some way to a Deaf person or working within the Deaf community.

As with many psychotropic drugs, lithium treatment requires continuous observation for adverse effects and strict monitoring of serum concentrations. The present study aimed to assess the appropriateness of lithium assays used by Belgian laboratories, and to evaluate acceptability of their clinical interpretations. Methods: Nine in-house serum samples spiked with predetermined concentrations of lithium were distributed to 114 participants in the Belgian external quality assessment scheme. Laboratories were requested to report the assay technique, lithium measurements and interpretations with regard to measured concentrations. Inter/intramethod imprecision and bias were reported and acceptability of clinical interpretations was assessed. The intramethod variability was evaluated by selecting methods used by 6 laboratories or more. Flame photometry (IL 943) was considered as the reference method. Results: Laboratories returned assay results using colorimetry (69. 3 %), ion selective electrode (15. 8 %), flame photometry (8. 8 %), atomic absorption spectroscopy (5. 2 %) or mass spectrometry (0. 9 %). Lithium concentrations were systematically higher when measured with the Vitros assay (median bias: 4. 0 %), and were associated with <b>consecutive</b> biased <b>interpretations.</b> In contrast, the Thermo Scientific Infinity assay showed a significant negative bias (median bias: 9. 4 %). 36. 0 % of laboratories reported numerical values below their manufacturer cut-off for the blank sample; 16. 6 % of these laboratories detected residual lithium concentrations.

50|$|No {{sooner had}} she started {{working as an}} {{interpreter}} than she also started thinking about how the process of interpreting conveys sense and, in the 1960s, started writing about it.

40|$|Among {{the tasks}} usually {{carried out by}} conference interpreters, the {{question}} was which task demands most attention or is the deepest {{in terms of the}} depth of processing hypothesis proposed by Craik and Lockhart (1972). Simultaneous interpretation is a complex form of human information processing, involving the perception, storage, retrieval, transformation and transmission of verbal information. Shadowing involves the imediate vocalization of auditorily presented stimuli in the same language, whereas simultaneous interpretation involves translation of the incoming message. Mic consecutive interpreter listens to a message in L 1, makes concurrent notes in L 2, and then delivers an oral translation of the original speech by way of his notes. In Experiment I, conference interpreters (both trainee and professional) shadowed, interpreted simultaneously and consecutively, as well as listeneýd to French passages before (a) recalling in English and (b) answering three recognition tests in source language measuring lexical, semantic and syntactic retention. Listening and <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpretation,</b> which yielded significantly higher recall scores than did shadowing, were considered deeper forms of processing than shadowing. Also, simultaneous listening and speaking impaired recall of the material. A second experiment eliminated the translation variable. Subjects listened to, shadowed and interpreted consecutively, English passages, followed by retention ffeasures in the same language. Only <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpretation</b> (labeled as 'consecutive reiteration') yielded scores that were significantly higher than shadowing. Listening and recalling in the same language demands less processing or effort than listening in one language and recalling in another. In a third experiment designed to examine the role played by notes, subjects (a) listened to, (b) interpreted a text consecutively and (c) took notes but had their notes unexpectedly removed and were asked to recall the original without rehearsal. <b>Consecutive</b> <b>interpretation</b> with notes kept during delivery yielded significantly higher retention scores than either other condition. Listening is as good a form of attending to a message as note-taking when notes are an external form of encoding. Notes coupled with review represent a useful strategy for subsequent recall but note-taking alone is of questionable value...|$|E
40|$|Conference interpreters {{are made}} not born, as Herbert (1978) and Mackintosh (1999) point out. The {{increase}} in the number of interpreting schools worldwide not only demonstrates the demand for qualified interpreters but also highlights the significance of training for ensuring quality service from conference interpreters. The purpose of training, ultimately, is to make competent interpreters who can deliver quality performance. Research on conference interpreting has tended to focus on issues of quality in professional circumstances (Buhler, 1986; Kahane, 2000; Kurz, 1993; Moser, 1996). Training is also one of the most explored fields in the world of conference interpreting research (Gile, 2000). Yet only limited work has been done to investigate quality standards for pedagogical purposes (Gile, 2001). To produce quality interpretations, practice alone is not enough. Being reflective is of prime importance. Trainees' awareness of quality is vital for them to become reflective, yet this issue has not been properly addressed in the literature. In addition, in the trainer-centred approach, trainees acquire not only interpreting skills from their trainers, they also inherit the way trainers describe quality. Yet it is often observed that trainers do not share a common meta-language to discuss quality attributes of interpretations. Such confusion is inevitably passed on to the trainees. To address these situations, I gathered quality standards and criteria from professional, training and linguistic fields and devised a feedback tool which spells out those attributes explicitly. This feedback tool is adopted to raise trainees' awareness of quality and ultimately, help them progress in their interpretations. Talking about quality of interpreting, `making sense' is generally held to be one of the most important criteria for judging the success of a given <b>interpretation,</b> in both <b>consecutive</b> interpreting (CI) and simultaneous interpreting (SI) (Hatim & Mason, 1997; Kahane, 2000; Kopczynski, 1994; Kurz, 1993; Moser, 1996). For CI in particular, Hatim and Mason (2002 : 262) state that the coherence and structure of the rendition are especially important (Peng & Hartley, 2005). Therefore, the significance of coherence should not be overlooked by trainees. Moreover, the development of coherence in their interpretations is a useful measure of their progress. Building awareness of quality attributes of interpreting, such as coherence, is a process of evolution for trainees, and systematic guidance can facilitate this process (Peng, 2004). In this study, we address the question of how to observe and investigate the development of coherence in interpreting. I propose that Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (1986) is a suitably rich discourse structure framework for exploring how coherence is realised in interpretations. RST has been widely used for describing the hierarchical organisation of natural texts in terms of some 30 functional relations holding between text chunks, thereby characterising the coherence of the whole text. It has also proven to be useful in describing the structure of spoken discourse (Tappe & Schilder, 1998). Its use by Marcu (2000) in automatic text summarisation - which introduces the notions of relevance and salience, and thereby a principled basis for progressively compressing a message -provides further inspiration for the analysis of my data. My data consist of 66 <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpretations,</b> by eight trainees and three professional interpreters, of three Chinese and three English speeches. Each speech and interpreted discourse is transcribed, segmented into functional units, and mapped into a tree-like RST description. I compare these RST trees using three variables: 1) implicit/explicit discourse marking; 2) the structure (width and depth) of the tree; 3) and the nature of the summary yielded by Marcu's summarisation algorithm RST also allows me to account for the occurrence of repair/self-correction to explore whether disfluency would impede the coherence of a discourse. The results from the comparison of trainee and professional performances reveal differing approaches to handling the coherence of a discourse. Trainees tend to focus on local cohesion while professionals tend to emphasise the global structure of the discourse. Furthermore, by observing the RST trees of trainee interpretations over time, I witness the development of their capacity for dealing with complex rhetorical structures by using more diverse and more specific connectives. In addition, I observe that a high frequency of self-correction definitely affects coherence, but few repairs do not guarantee good coherence. It is also noted that clear understanding of quality attributes, such as coherence, helps trainees to develop capacities in giving judgements of interpretations (Peng & Hartley, 2005). My evidence suggests this awareness also contributes to the improvement of their own performances. I believe that RST offers a very useful framework to describe the abstract concept of coherence. It is also worth introducing RST analysis (or at least an RSTaware analysis) to interpreters during their training. Such analysis enables them to capture the structure of coherence better and to give more coherent renditions in ivtheir interpreting as a result. This thesis demonstrates that my exploratory approach offers interesting findings and implications for interpreter training, as well as directions for further research in both the conference interpreting and RST communities.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the research conducted in interpreter-training {{based on the}} experience of teaching oral <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpretation</b> in two groups of undergraduate students approximately of the same level of linguistic and translation skills. In one of the groups – key informants – metacognitive approach was applied to have the would-be interpreters conscious of what they are expected to be successful interpreters.   As many scholars in this field claim, metacognitive competence developed in the process of education is believed to form the ability to meet the challenges an interpreter can face executing oral <b>consecutive</b> <b>interpretation.</b> Since attentiveness and memory are viewed as important mechanisms of psychological base of the type of interpretation under consideration, special sets of exercises directed to developing these properties in interpreters-to be elaborated by contemporary scholars according to special methodology were given in this group. The next group – focus group – was also provided with the same educational technologies and other facilities as the group of key informants, but metacognitive approach and aforementioned sets of exercises were not used in it. Long-term memory tests held at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the semester in both the groups demonstrate that metacognitive approach in combination with special sets of exercises lead to much better results in long-term memory developing...|$|E
40|$|<b>Consecutive</b> <b>interpretation</b> {{requires}} {{quite a lot}} {{of intellectual}} and physical effort from the interpreter. One of the factors that makes interpretation rather difficult is the length of sections of the text that should be translated. Having acquired the special skill of taking notes, the interpreter makes his work easier and becomes more independent of the speaker's habit. The author shares his experience in working out his own way of taking notes, pointing out a certain need for “creative attitude” that has to be acquired by students on interpreting courses...|$|E
