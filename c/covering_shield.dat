6000|$|There {{was much}} need in Homeric warfare for {{protection}} against heavy showers of arrows. Mr. Monro is hardly correct {{when he says}} that, in Homer, [...] "we do not hear of BODIES of archers, of arrows darkening the air, as in descriptions of oriental warfare." [...] [Footnote: Ibid., vol. ii. 305.] These precise phrases are not used by Homer; but, nevertheless, arrows are flying thick in his battle pieces. The effects are not often noticed, because, in Homer, helmet, shield, corslet, zoster, and greaves, as a rule prevent the shafts from harming the well-born, well-armed chiefs; the nameless host, however, fall frequently. When Hector came forward for a parley (Iliad, III. 79), the Achaens [...] "kept shooting at him with arrows," [...] which he took unconcernedly. Teucer shoots nine men in Iliad, VIII. 297-304. In XI. 85 the shafts ([Greek: belea]) showered and the common soldiers fell--[misprint] being arrows as well as thrown spears. [Footnote: Iliad, IV. 465; XVI. 668, 678.] Agamemnon and Achilles are as likely, they say, {{to be hit by}} arrow as by spear (XI. 191; XXI. 13). Machaon is wounded by an arrow. Patroclus meets Eurypylus limping, with an arrow in his thigh--archer unknown. [Footnote: Iliad, XI. 809, 810.] Meriones, though an Achaean paladin, sends a bronze-headed arrow through the body of Harpalion (XIII. 650). The light-armed Locrians are all bowmen and slingers (XIII. 716). Acamas taunts the Argives as [...] "bowmen" [...] (XIV. 479). [...] "The war-cry rose on both sides, and the arrows leaped from the bowstrings" [...] (XV. 313). Manifestly the arrows are always on the wing, hence the need for the huge Homeric and Mycenaean shields. Therefore, as the Achaeans in Homer wore but flimsy corslets (this we are going to prove), the great body- <b>covering</b> <b>shield</b> of the Mycenaean prime did not go out of vogue in Homer's time, when bronze had superseded stone arrow-heads, but was strengthened by bronze plating over the leather. In a later age the bow was more and more neglected in Greek warfare, and consequently large shields went out, after the close of the Mycenaean age, and round parrying bucklers came into use.|$|E

5000|$|The shield {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "tour de force" [...] of beaten bronze work. There are no other complete bronze facings that survive in Europe. This is partially due to their rarity, as Celtic shields were normally constructed from unsheathed wood. The idea of <b>covering</b> a <b>shield</b> with bronze is a mark of Greek or Etruscan influence. The shield is comparable with other shields found in Britain dating from the same period, such as the Chertsey Shield and the Battersea Shield which were also found in rivers. The British Museum consider this shield to be [...] "one of the best examples of the way British craftspeople adopted the new style of La Tène art".|$|R

50|$|It was {{believed}} that the improper pitch signals on Samos 4's launch vehicle had been caused by accidental separation of a heat <b>shield</b> <b>covering</b> the retrorockets on the Atlas equipment pods.

50|$|Tremataspis is a genus of an extinct osteostracan agnathan {{from the}} Silurian period {{of what is}} now Estonia. Tremataspis was about 10 cm in length, and had an armored <b>shield</b> <b>{{covering}}</b> its head. Compared with its relatives, the shield was unusually elongated, covering the whole front of the body, and was more rounded in shape. It is thought that Tremataspis used its rounder shield to burrow in the ocean floor, searching for food. Because the shield consisted of one solid piece, it probably did not grow during the animal's life; presumably, the larvae lacked the shield, which only appeared later in life.|$|R

500|$|As {{the field}} was cleared, silence descended on the arena {{following}} the King's [...] instructions that anybody who interfered in the duel would be executed and that anyone who shouted or verbally interrupted the combat would lose a hand. Readying their steeds, the knights squared up and at the marshal's signal, charged towards one another. Their lances struck but failed to penetrate the thick hides <b>covering</b> their <b>shields</b> and the combatants wheeled and charged again, this time striking one another on their helms. Rounding once more, the knights charged a third time, again striking shields and this time both shattering their lances. Reeling from the impact, the warriors drew their axes and charged a fourth time. Slashing and kicking at {{one another in the}} centre of the field, they traded blows until Le Gris, the much stronger man, was able to drive his axe through the neck of Carrouges' horse. As the beheaded beast tumbled to the ground, Carrouges jumped clear and lashed out with his own weapon, disemboweling Le Gris' steed in turn.|$|R

5|$|Andreacarus voalavo is a {{parasitic}} mite {{found on}} the Malagasy rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus. First described in 2007, it {{is closely related to}} Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, which are found on other Malagasy rodents. The length of the idiosoma, the main body, is 630 to 670μm in females and 450 to 480μm in males. Unlike A.eliurus, this species lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between two lyrifissures (sensory organs) on {{the lower part of the}} female body. The pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the chelicera, is serrate, which distinguishes it from A.gymnuromys.

60|$|Edmund {{had never}} before seen the Danes, {{and he could not}} but admit that their {{appearance}} was enough to shake the stoutest heart. All carried great <b>shields</b> <b>covering</b> them from head to foot. These were composed of wood, bark, or leather painted or embossed, and in the cases of the chiefs plated with gold and silver. So large were these that in naval encounters, if the fear of falling into the enemy's hands forced them to throw themselves into the sea, they could float on their shields; and after death in battle a soldier was carried to his grave on his buckler. As they stood facing the Saxons they locked their shields together so as to form a barrier well-nigh impregnable against the arrows.|$|R
