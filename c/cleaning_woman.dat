25|$|The Starrs {{were living}} at 34 Montagu Square, Marylebone, when Epstein's {{accountant}} {{suggested that the}} group members should move to houses near his, in Esher. Lennon bought a house called Kenwood in St George's Hill, Weybridge, Harrison bought Kinfauns on a nearby estate in Esher, and on 24 July 1965, the Starrs bought Sunny Heights, on South Road, St George's Hill, for £30,000 ($72,000). Ken Partridge was asked to redesign {{the interior of the}} six-bedroomed house, incorporating a private pub above the garage, called The Flying Cow, which had a mirrored bar, pool table, jukebox, and a portrait of Lennon and McCartney on the wall. A TV was usually on in every single room, and a go-kart track was laid in the grounds. Although she cooked for the family, the Starrs had a nanny who lived in the house, and a <b>cleaning</b> <b>woman</b> who visited every day.|$|E

500|$|... "Night of the Dead Living" [...] was {{originally}} intended to be the third episode of the season, but NBC programmers moved {{it to the end}} of the season because they felt its slow pace and lack of traditional action was inappropriate early in the series, when the show was trying to woo viewers. The broadcast schedule change led to some consistency and time-line errors, which Homicide producers addressed by adding the words [...] "One hot night, last September..." [...] to the beginning of the episode. Actress N'Bushe Wright makes a guest appearance as a <b>cleaning</b> <b>woman</b> who loses her baby in the police station.|$|E
500|$|They began dating, with Lennon now {{referring}} to her as [...] "Cyn". In the autumn of 1958, she ended her engagement to be with him, and he ended his relationship with another art student, Thelma Pickles. [...] His jealousy could also manifest itself in violent behaviour towards her, as when he slapped her across the face (causing her head to hit a wall), after watching her dance with Stuart Sutcliffe. After the incident, she broke up with Lennon for three months, but resumed their relationship after his profuse apology. Another time a <b>cleaning</b> <b>woman</b> at the college caught Lennon hitting her and suggested she stay away from him.|$|E

[...] Named after Chekhov's characters by their theater-enthusiast professor parents, Vanya and Sonia have not had to grow up. After spending their adulthood looking after their now-dead parents, neither has a job, and money is provided by their movie star sister Masha, who owns the house and pays the bills. Vanya (who is gay) and Sonia (who is forever reminding everyone that she was adopted) spend their days reflecting on their lost chances, debating whether the grove of nine cherry trees on their property constitutes an orchard, and bemoaning their rather Chekhovian lot in life. The only other resident {{of the house is}} their <b>cleaning</b> <b>woman</b> Cassandra, who, like her namesake, is prone to making dire prophecies that no one believes.|$|E

500|$|According to Durang, [...] "My play {{is not a}} Chekhov parody...I take Chekhov {{scenes and}} {{characters}} {{and put them into}} a blender." [...] Although the characters in the play, named by university professors, share names with Chekhov characters, they are not the same characters. They share some elements but are fully imagined. Durang mentioned that Masha is more like Madame Arkadina in The Seagull than any of Chekhov's characters named Masha. Rather than mimic Three Sisters, his play has a sister, brother and adopted sister, with the latter two being the most Chekhovian of the title characters. Durang has described Nina as most like a Chekhov character, and related to the character of the same name in The Seagull. After five marriages to her contemporaries, Masha has taken up with Spike in a May–December relationship. Durang says that [...] "Cassandra, who's a <b>cleaning</b> <b>woman</b> and soothsayer, is like the Greek-tragedy Cassandra. In some ways, she's like the nanny in Vanya, but she doesn't reflect Chekhov as much." ...|$|E

Only his brother Mahmoud, who was a thirty years old single and worker at the ministry of Justice, decided to invest in his brother's education. Thanks to his support and aid, Bourguiba enrolled in Lycée Carnot of Tunis. Bourguiba stated in 1973 the reasons his brother supported him: [...] "As for [...] "si" [...] Mahmoud, I had forgotten {{to tell you that the}} year I passed my certificat d'études primaires and lost my mother, he had just left Sadiki where he was an intern. He was in classe de seconde. I lived, myself in Tourbet El Bey. Every Friday and Sunday of every week, he came home to teach me. But he used, during his task, an unpreceeded brutality and savagery. He was in such a furry that he beat me like plaster. I was still not ten and my fear was so intense that I could not even focus or understand tasks that he asked me. Each time, panicked, the <b>cleaning</b> <b>woman</b> rushed to the window and cried for help.
