2500|$|Because of {{the lack}} of {{resistance}} between Dessie and Addis Ababa, Badoglio risked a spectacular advance with a [...] "mechanized column" [...] for propaganda purposes. In 1936, [...] "mechanized" [...] meant infantry transported in a variety of <b>commercial</b> <b>cars</b> and trucks. [...] "Motorised infantry" [...] is a more appropriate term for Badoglio's column.|$|R
5000|$|For 1934 {{the word}} [...] "Essex" [...] was dropped {{and the car}} became the Terraplane. The cars were {{slightly}} heavier and rarely joined competitive events, particularly as they now lacked the eight-cylinder powerplant. The name Terraplane remained constant through the 1937 model year. By 1936, Terraplane <b>commercial</b> <b>cars</b> were produced in larger numbers.|$|R
50|$|Like other semi-{{trailers}}, most <b>commercial</b> <b>car</b> carrier trailers {{attach to}} the tractor using a fifth wheel coupling. Trailers can either be enclosed, possessing walls like a conventional box trailer, which affords the shipped vehicles more protection {{at the cost of}} lower capacity; or open, as in the commonly seen skeletal tube steel design, which exposes the vehicles to the elements but allows for greater carrying capacity. An American <b>commercial</b> <b>car</b> carrier typically fits between 5 and 9 cars, depending on the car size and trailer model (capacity is limited by an 80,000 lb weight cap that a road vehicle is subject to under U.S. law.). Significantly higher-capacity vehicles have been observed around the world, such as a side-by-side loading Chinese model.|$|E
50|$|Regenerative and {{friction}} braking must both be used, creating {{the need to}} control them to produce the required total braking. The GM EV-1 was the first <b>commercial</b> <b>car</b> to do this. In 1997 and 1998 engineers Abraham Farag and Loren Majersik were issued two patents for this brake-by-wire technology.|$|E

50|$|<b>Commercial</b> <b>car</b> {{bodies are}} never monocoques but instead most cars use a method called {{variously}} unibody/unitary construction/unitary body/chassis or body frame integral construction, which uses box sections, bulkheads and tubes providing {{most of the}} strength of the vehicle, while the skin adds relatively little strength or stiffness. The term monocoque is frequently misused when referring to unibody cars.|$|E
50|$|With {{the modern}} {{convenience}} of touchless automatic car washes, {{it may be}} difficult to remember that the industry was not always so high-tech. Though, other <b>commercial</b> <b>car</b> washes came before it, the first semi-automatic car wash in the United States made its debut in 1946, and from there, the industry has grown in both size and sophistication.|$|E
50|$|It was {{developed}} with an aim {{to offer a}} <b>commercial</b> <b>car</b> at as low cost as possible. It shared some parts with Tatra 12 and with Tatra 30. However the motor tricycle wasn't a commercial success and only about 200 of them were made. A few cars of the type had also carrossery {{similar to the one}} of Tatra 12.|$|E
50|$|The vehicle {{obtained}} from Christie {{became the basis}} of the Cruiser Mk III (A13). It had to be extensively redesigned by Morris <b>Commercial</b> <b>Cars</b> as it was too small and had several faults that Christie had not addressed. A new company Nuffield Mechanization & Aero Limited was formed for the development and production of the design.|$|R

50|$|These {{trucks are}} easily mistaken for B or V-8 {{commercial}} cars {{built on the}} passenger car chassis. Sedan deliveries, pickups, and station wagons were the best remembered of these. They had elongated bodies and stiffer springs, and were generally shown in the <b>commercial</b> <b>car</b> catalogue, even if the wagon was the most expensive body style available on the passenger car chassis.|$|E
50|$|The FAI {{was built}} on the chassis of the GAZ A car, a {{licensed}} copy of the US Ford A. This chassis was the major weakness of the FAI. Most <b>commercial</b> <b>car</b> chassis were not powerful enough to move a useful amount of armour or firepower on the battlefield. The Germans were known to get round this particular problem by designing a car chassis that was intended from the outset for both civilian and military vehicles and which was used successfully in at least one German armoured car family of this period. However, armoured cars based on <b>commercial</b> <b>car</b> chassis were, for the most part, road-bound, thinly armoured and lightly armed. The FAI was a typical example of this class of vehicle with a single 7.62 mm DT machine-gun in a revolving turret. The armour was sufficient to stop most shell fragments and small arms fire, but could not withstand any kind of cannon or heavy machine-gun fire. It was also very vulnerable to mines.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, General Motors, {{decided to}} idle, then shutter, the Framingham Assembly, citing its small size and issues with town leaders. The plant was later {{shut down in}} 1989 (labor {{contracts}} prohibited closing the plant until 1990), laying off 2,100 workers, down {{from a peak of}} 5,000 from Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. This brought to an end to <b>commercial</b> <b>car</b> manufacturing in the state.|$|E

40|$|Car-commercials are {{something}} {{that many people}} {{come in contact with}} on a daily basis. This is a study on <b>commercials</b> for <b>cars</b> and is focusing on visual effects that are made in post-production. In this report we are trying to find out if and how visual effects in <b>commercials</b> for <b>cars</b> affect how the observer remembers them. The second subjects that we use in this report is popularity and we try to find out if and in that case how visual effects affect the <b>commercials</b> for <b>cars</b> popularity. We also investigated how frequently <b>commercials</b> for <b>cars</b> are showed on TV and how the visual effects are in them, it gives a better foundation to the other parts. The methods we applied were interviews, quantitative and qualitative content analysis of <b>car</b> <b>commercials</b> and also observation analysis of the 6 swedish TV-channels that shows commercials and have the most viewers, to get an idea how frequently these commercials are shown. The commercials that were applied in this paper was from late 2011 to early 2012. Interviews were made with people from the ages 16 to 76 years old with an equal distribution of sexes. We used 4 different <b>commercials</b> for <b>cars</b> in our interviews with 4 different degrees of the amount of visual effects. We analyzed 6 Swedish TV-channels that show commercials and that have the most viewers to get an idea about how frequently <b>commercials</b> for <b>car</b> are shown. The result of our research showed us that there was no connection between visual effects and popularity and that a larger amount of visual effects can increase the observers tendency to remember a commercial with 15 percentage. Most commercials from the studied period was without visual effects and 13, 3 % had a larger amount of visual effect...|$|R
