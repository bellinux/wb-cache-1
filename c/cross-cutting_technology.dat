40|$|The work {{performed}} {{on this program}} was to develop wear resistant, tough FM composite materials with efforts focused on WC-Co based FM systems. The materials were developed for use in mining industry wear applications. Components of interest were drill bit inserts for drilling blast holes. Other component applications investigated included wear plates {{for a variety of}} equipment such as pit shovels, wear surfaces for conveyors, milling media for ball milling operations, hydrocyclone cones, grader blades and dozer teeth. Cross-cutting technologies investigated included hot metal extrusion dies, drill bits for circuit board fabrication, cutting tools for cast iron and aluminum machining. An important part of the work was identification of the standard materials used in drilling applications. A materials trade study to determine those metals and ceramics used for mining applications provided guidance for the most important materials to be investigated. WC-Co and diamond combinations were shown to have the most desirable properties. Other considerations such as fabrication technique and the ability to consolidate shifted the focus away from diamond materials and toward WC-Co. Cooperating partners such as Kennametal and Kyocera assisted with supplies, evaluations of material systems, fabricated parts and suggestions for <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>technology</b> applications for FM architectures. Kennametal provided the raw materials (WC-Co and Al-TiCN powders) for the extent of the material evaluations. Kyocera shared their research into various FM systems and provided laboratory testing of fabricated materials. Field testing provided by partners Superior Rock Bit and Brady Mining and Construction provided insight into the performance of the fabricated materials under actual operational conditions.

Based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the highly automated sensor system can provide near-real-time response with minimal sampling. The technology, {{in the form of}} a flow-through nuclear-magnetic-resonance-based on-line process sensing and control system, can rapidly monitor {sup 99 }Tc speciation and concentration (from 0. 1 molar to 10 micro molar) in the feedstocks and eluents of radioactive-waste treatment processes.

40|$|The need to {{increase}} the diffusion of energy efficiency measures (EEMs) is of crucial importance to achieve a consistent reduction of energy consumption and green house gases (GHG) emissions. A clear comprehension {{of the characteristics of}} such EEMs could assist in gathering and capitalizing all the information needed by industrial firms in selecting and adopting technologies, as well as by policy-makers in designing appropriate policies for their diffusion. Therefore, in this study, starting from a literature review of the studies analyzing the attributes of EEMs, we aim at providing an innovative and comprehensive framework to characterize such measures, based on 17 attributes grouped according to six categories, such as: economic, energy, environmental, production-related, implementation-related and the possible interaction with other systems. We applied this scheme to an extensive range of EEMs in <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>technologies,</b> i. e. motors, compressed air, lighting and HVAC systems. The analysis provides a relevant contribution firstly to the structuring and the sharing of knowledge on EEMs and hence to the comprehension of the barriers currently hindering their adoption; secondly, it provides a structured basis for the analysis of the drivers that policy-makers should develop in order to promote industrial energy efficiency...|$|R

Phase 1 of the Automated Baseline Change Detection project is summarized in this topical report. The primary objective of this project is to apply robotic and optical sensor technology to the operational inspection of mixed toxic and radioactive waste stored in barrels, using Automated Baseline Change Detection (ABCD), based on image subtraction. Absolute change detection is based on detecting any visible physical changes, regardless of cause, between a current inspection image of a barrel and an archived baseline image of the same barrel. Thus, in addition to rust, the ABCD system can also detect corrosion, leaks, dents, and bulges. The ABCD approach and method rely on precise camera positioning and repositioning relative to the barrel and on feature recognition in images.

40|$|AbstractLiquid alloy {{systems have}} {{a high degree of}} thermal conductivity, far {{superior}} to ordinary nonmetallic liquids and inherent high densities and electrical conductivities. This results in the use of these materials for specific heat conducting and dissipation applications for the nuclear and space sectors. Uniquely, they can be used to conduct heat and electricity between nonmetallic and metallic surfaces. The motion of liquid metals in strong magnetic fields generally induces electric currents, which, while interacting with the magnetic field, produce electromagnetic forces. Electromagnetic pumps exploit the fact that liquid metals are conducting fluids capable of carrying currents, which is a source of electromagnetic fields useful for pumping and diagnostics. The coupling between the electromagnetics and thermo-fluid mechanical phenomena and the determination of its geometry and electrical configuration, gives rise to complex engineering magnetohydrodynamics problems. The development of tools to model, characterize, design, and build liquid metal thermo-magnetic systems for space, nuclear, and industrial applications are of primordial importance and represent a <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>technology</b> that can provide unique design and development capabilities as well as {{a better understanding of the}} physics behind the magneto-hydrodynamics of liquid metals.

40|$|Paper {{production}} is an energy-intensive process {{and accounted for}} about 9 % of industrial energy demand in Germany in 2008. There have only been slow improvements in energy efficiency in the paper industry {{over the past twenty}} years. Policies can accelerate the progress made, but knowledge about the remaining efficiency potentials and their costs is a prerequisite for their success. We assess 17 process technologies to improve energy efficiency in the German pulp and paper industry up to 2035 using a techno-economic approach. These result in a saving potential of 34 TJ/a for fuels and 12 TJ/a for electricity, which equal 21 % and 16 % of fuel and electricity demand, respectively. The energy savings can be translated into mitigated CO 2 emissions of 3 Mt. The larger part of this potential is found to be cost-effective from a firm's perspective. The most influential technologies are heat recovery in paper mills and the use of innovative paper drying technologies. In conclusion, significant saving potentials are still available, but are limited if we assume that current paper production processes will not change radically. Further savings would be available if the system boundaries of this study were extended to e. g. include <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>technologies...</b>|$|R

Hydrogen technologies {{have had an}} unsteady past but the new development and the worldwide growing energy demand will for sure require all facets of any energy technology including those of hydrogen and fuel cell related technologies. Hydrogen is most versatile in its production, transportation and end use. This is indicated by {{the broad range of}} technologies shown in this report. Acceptable storage technologies for pressurised and liquefied hydrogen are available. The fuel cell development progressed considerably the last decade.

However, the pressure and temperature levels involved with some new hydrogen technologies in the hands of private users, still pose some problems to be resolved. As hydrogen provides an efficient energy storage it will support the shift towards renewable energies and it will make the energy market more decentralised and flexible.

This computer technology has had its technical readiness level steadily increased over the past 8 years through a variety of tests and flight demonstrations. These include high energy particle bombardment at the Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M Radiation Effects Facility, 8 high altitude balloon flights to 30 km, and a 2014 sounding rocket flight to 120 km.

40|$|The International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) {{has chosen}} dust {{mitigation}} technology as a Global Exploration Roadmap (GER) critical technology {{need in order}} to reduce life cycle cost and risk, and increase the probability of mission success. NASA has also included Particulate Contamination Prevention and Mitigation as a <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>technology</b> to be developed for contamination prevention, cleaning and protection. This technology has been highlighted due to the detrimental effect of dust on both human and robotic missions. During manned Apollo missions, dust caused issues with both equipment and crew. Contamination of equipment caused many issues including incorrect instrument readings and increased temperatures due to masking of thermal radiators. The astronauts were directly affected by dust that covered space suits, obscured face shields and later propagated to the cabin and into the crew's eyes and lungs. Robotic missions on Mars were affected when solar panels were obscured by dust thereby reducing the effectiveness of the solar panels. The Electrostatics and Surface Physics Lab in Swamp Works at the Kennedy Space Center has been developing an Electrodynamic Dust Shield (EDS) to remove dust from multiple surfaces, including glass shields and thermal radiators. This technology has been tested in lab environments and has evolved over several years. Tests of the technology include reduced gravity flights (one-sixth g) in which Apollo Lunar dust samples were successfully removed from glass shields while under vacuum (10 (exp - 6) kPa) ...|$|E
40|$|NASA's <b>Cross-Cutting</b> <b>Technology</b> Development Program {{identified}} {{formation flying}} {{as a key}} enabler {{for the next generation}} Earth and Sciences campaign. It is hoped that this technology will allow a distributed network of autonomous satellites to act collaboratively as a single collective unit paving the way for extensive co-observing campaigns, coordinated multi-point observing programs, improved space-based interferometry, and entirely new approaches to conducting science. APL as a team member with GSFC, funded by the Earth Sciences and Technology Organization (ESTO), investigated formation deployment and initialization concepts which is central to the formation flying concept. This paper presents the analytical approach and preliminary results of the study. The study investigated a simple mission involving the deployment of six micro-satellites, one at a time, from a bus. At the initialization state, the satellites fly in an along-track trajectory separated by nominal spacing. The study entailed the development of a two-body (bus and satellite) relative motion propagator based on Clohessy-Wiltshire (C-W) equations with drag from which the relative motion of the micro-satellites is deduced. This code was used to investigate cluster development characteristics subject to "tip-off' (ejection) conditions. Results indicate that cluster development is very sensitive to the ballistic coefficients of the bus and satellites, and to relative ejection velocity. This information can be used to identify optimum deployment parameters, along with accuracy bounds for a particular mission, and to develop a cluster control strategy minimizing global fuel and cost. A suitable control strategy concept has been identified, however, it needs to be developed further...|$|E
40|$|As {{a typical}} <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>technology,</b> cooling and {{refrigeration}} equipment {{is used for}} a variety of industrial applications. While cooling is often provided by electric compression cooling systems, thermal cooling systems powered by low-temperature waste heat could improve energy efficiency and promise a technical saving potential corresponding to 0. 5 % of the total electricity demand in the German industry. In this paper, we investigate the current and future cost-effectiveness of thermal cooling systems for industrial companies. Our focus is on single-stage, closed absorption and adsorption cooling systems with cooling powers between 40 and 100 kW, which use low-temperature waste heat at temperature levels between 70 °C and 85 °C. We analyse the current and future cost-effectiveness of these alternative cooling systems using annual cooling costs (annuities) and payback times. For a forecast until 2015, we apply the concept of experience curves, identifying learning ra tes of 14 % (absorption machines) and 17 % (adsorption machines) by an expert survey of the German market. The results indicate that thermal cooling systems are currently only cost-effective under optimistic assumptions (full-time operation, high electricity prices) when compared to electric compression cooling systems. Nevertheless, the cost and efficiency improvements expected for this still young technology mean that thermal cooling systems could be more cost-effective in the future. However, depending on future electricity prices, a high number of operating hours is still crucial to achieve payback times substantially below 4 years which are usually required for energy efficiency measures to be widely adopted in the industry...|$|E
40|$|An {{increased}} {{flexibility of}} the electricity demand side through demand response (DR) {{is an opportunity to}} support the integration of renewable energies. By optimising the use of the generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, DR reduces the need for costly investments and contributes to system security. There is a significant technical DR potential for load reduction from industrial production processes in Germany, as well as from <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>technologies</b> in industry and the tertiary sector. The availability of demand response as a system resource depends on the underlying type of demand. Already today energy-intensive industries market significant demand capacity in the German minute reserve. The DR literature reveals that there is a potential of several gigawatts of additional capacity available for at least one hour in Germany. Demand can also cover longer periods, but this often requires investment, for example in storage capacity for intermediate products. To enable the effective use and full remuneration of demand response, further improvements in power market design are discussed: (i) Enabling third parties (referred to as Demand Side Management Companies) to help business customers realise their flexibility potential; (ii) creating robust intraday and balancing prices in auction platforms as reference prices for longer-term contracts to stabilise revenue streams of flexibility providers; (iii) it needs to be further assessed whether additional catalysing instruments are necessary to initiate investment in new business processes or storage capacity...|$|R

Existing methods {{have not been able}} to detect cracks early enough in the production cycle to prevent inadvertent shipment to customers. This program, sponsored under the DOE Photovoltaic Supply Chain and <b>Cross-Cutting</b> <b>Technologies</b> program, studied the feasibility of quantifying surface micro-discontinuities by use of a novel technique, thermoreflectance imaging, to detect surface temperature gradients with very high spatial resolution, in combination with a suite of conventional imaging methods such as electroluminescence. The project carried out laboratory tests together with computational image analyses using sample solar cells with known defects supplied by industry sources or DOE National Labs. Quantitative comparisons between the effectiveness of the new technique and conventional methods were determined in terms of the smallest detectable crack. Also the robustness of the new technique for reliable microcrack detection was determined at various stages of processing such as before and after antireflectance treatments. An overall assessment is that the new technique compares favorably with existing methods such as lock-in thermography or ultrasonics. The project was 100 % completed in Sept, 2010.

40|$|Industrial energy {{efficiency}} has {{raised to the}} top of European energy policy agenda, and particular efforts should be placed to tackle the barriers to {{energy efficiency}} of small and non-energy intensive industrial users. To enhance the adoption rate of a specific industrial energy efficiency measure, it is crucial to properly evaluate the barriers. Without a proper level of detail e considering both the measure's specificity and the evaluation's perspective e company managers are hampered when making investment decisions, and policymakers are prevented from developing the most effective policies. The paper aims at highlighting that the value of a given intervention-dependent barrier may differ when evaluating it at the company level, by technology area, or with respect to a specific measure. To achieve this objective, an exploratory investigation of Italian small and medium-sized enterprises into the metalworking sector has been performed with respect to selected <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>technologies.</b> Although general barriers appear as most relevant at the company level, large differences appear when considering intervention-dependent barriers by technology area {{as well as at the}} energy efficiency measure level. The research presents innovative results, as the literature and policymakers have not accounted so far for how the value of barriers can effectively vary with respect to a single measure, but have only considered barriers at company level. Additionally, the paper highlights that differences can be appreciated when evaluating the intervention-dependent barriers according to some firm characteristics (i. e. size, production complexity, and innovativeness).

40|$|Australia’s total {{primary energy}} {{consumption}} grew by 3. 6 per cent per annum between 1993 / 94 and 1997 / 98, while primary energy use in the electricity sector rose by more than 5 per cent per year over the same period. Since 1993 / 94, brown coal has strongly expanded its share in the fuel mix of the interconnected electricity markets of Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, and South Australia. It has become the primary fuel source for electricity generation, substituting for hydro, natural gas and hard coal. At the national level, this has meant that the long-term trend towards greater use of natural gas has stalled in favour of coal, especially brown coal. Since Victoria’s brown coal plants have relatively low thermal efficiencies, this substitution has also {{had the effect of}} reducing the average thermal efficiency in the power market to the levels of the late 1980 s (IEA, 2001 b). It {{should be noted that the}} economic objective of reducing the price of power which has driven the first stage of reform in the electricity industry in Australia has perversely encouraged the aggregate use of energy in the economy.

The workshop brought together experts in climate science, computational climate science, computer science, and mathematics to discuss interesting but unsolved science questions regarding climate modeling and simulation, promoted collaboration among the diverse scientists in attendance, and brainstormed about possible tools and capabilities that could be developed to help address them. Emerged from discussions at the workshop were several research opportunities that the group felt could advance climate science significantly. These include (1) process-resolving models to provide insight into important processes and features of interest and inform the development of advanced physical parameterizations, (2) a community effort to develop and provide integrated model credibility, (3) including, organizing, and managing increasingly connected model components that increase model fidelity yet complexity, and (4) treating Earth system models as one interconnected organism without numerical or data based boundaries that limit interactions. The group also identified several cross-cutting advances in mathematics, computer science, and computational science that {{would be needed to}} enable {{one or more of these}} big ideas. It is critical to address the need for organized, verified, and optimized software, which enables the models to grow and continue to provide solutions in which the community can have confidence. Effectively utilizing the newest computer hardware enables simulation efficiency and the ability to handle output from increasingly complex and detailed models. This will be accomplished through hierarchical multiscale algorithms in tandem with new strategies for data handling, analysis, and storage. These big ideas and <b>cross-cutting</b> <b>technologies</b> for enabling breakthrough climate simulation advancements also need the "glue" of outreach and learning across the scientific domains to be successful.

Examples include follow-on cross-cutting meetings that enable unstructured discussions of the types this workshop fostered. A concerted effort to recruit undergraduate and graduate students from all relevant domains and provide them experience, training, and networking across their immediate expertise is needed.

At this point, findings suggest that <b>cross-cutting</b> Key Enabling <b>Technologies</b> (KETs) could improve the overall performance of the system given that the convergence of technologies in nanotechnology, biotechnology, micro&nanoelectronics and advanced materials permit the development of new medical devices of small dimensions, using biocompatible materials, and embedding reliable and targeted biosensors, high speed data communication, and even energy autonomy. Therefore, this article deals with new research and market challenges of implantable sensor devices, {{from the point of view}} of the pervasive system, and time-to-market. The remote clinical monitoring approach introduced in this paper could be based on an array of biosensors to extract information from the patient. A key contribution of the authors is that the general architecture introduced in this paper would require minor modifications for the final customized bio-implantable medical device...|$|R
40|$|Sandia National Laboratories Environmental Restoration Technologies Department is {{developing}} environmental restoration technologies through funding form the US Department of Energy`s (DOE`s) Office of Science and Technology. Initially, this technology {{development has been}} through the Mixed Waste Landfill Integrated Demonstration (MWLID). It is currently being developed through the Contaminant Plume containment and Remediation Focus Area, the Landfill Stabilization Focus Area, and the Characterization, Monitoring, and Sensor <b>Cross-Cutting</b> Program. This <b>Technology</b> Integration Project (TIP) was responsible for transferring MWLID-developed technologies for routine use by environmental restoration groups throughout the DOE complex and commercializing these technologies to the private sector. The MWLID`s technology transfer/commercialization successes were achieved by involving private industry in development, demonstration, and technology transfer/commercialization activities; gathering and disseminating information about MWLID activities and technologies; and promoting stakeholder and regulatory involvement. From FY 91 through FY 95, 30 Technical Task Plans (TTPs) were funded. From these TTPs, the MWLID can claim 15 technology transfer/commercialization successes. Another seven technology transfer/commercialization successes are expected. With the changeover to the focus areas, the TIP continued the technology transfer/commercialization efforts begun under the MWLID...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} alleged un-tapped {{potentials}} for cost effective energy savings {{in the industrial}} sector various policies have been implemented to overcome barriers {{to the adoption of}} energy efficiency measures by companies. Especially, small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) are supported in their adoption decision by informational and financial instruments. To adequately design these instruments a thorough understanding about their mechanism is crucial. Thus, this paper investigates the impact of two financial instruments (funding for <b>cross-cutting</b> (CC) <b>technologies,</b> low-interest loan) in addition to an informational instrument (energy audit) on the adoption of four generic energy efficiency measures in SMEs in Germany. Based on 766 observations, we apply t-tests and propensity score matching techniques to estimate the effects of these instruments. Findings suggest that the financial instruments in addition to an energy audit accelerate the adoption, but effectiveness varies by technologies. Based on a t-test, the adoption rate for insulation is 15 % and for heating 19 % higher for companies which used a low-interest loan (and an energy audit) compared to companies which only had an energy audit. For lighting, the adoption rate is nearly 12 % higher for companies which used the CC technologies programme (and an energy audit) compared to the control group. The propensity score matching results differ: To adopt measures for insulation the propensity is 12 %, for heating optimization 12 % and for heating about 25 % higher for companies which used a low-interest loan (and energy audit) compared to the control group. Regarding lighting we do not find a significant effect of the CC technologies programme on the adoption. Findings indicate that estimates of policy effectiveness by t-tests might be misleading, i. e. overestimating the effectiveness regarding the adoption of measures for lighting, insulation and heating optimization, and underestimating the effectiveness for heating...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An EPR fission {{plant is}} {{expected}} to operate from 2010 to 2070. In this time range {{a new generation of}} advanced fission reactors and several stages of fusion reactors from ITER to DEMO will emerge. Their viability in the competitive socio-economic environment and also their possible synergy benefits are discussed in this paper. The studied cases involve the Finnish EPR, Generation IV, and the EFDA Conceptual power plant study Models A-D. The main concentration is on economic and safety assessments. Some <b>cross-cutting</b> issues of <b>technologies</b> are discussed. Concerning the economic potential of both conceptual fusion power plants and those of Generation IV candidates, we have applied the present Finnish EPR as a reference. Comparisons using various pricing methods are being studied for fusion and Generation IV: the mass flow analyzes together with engineering, construction and financial margins exhibit one method and another one on simple scaling relations between components or structures with common technology level. In all these studies fusion competitiveness has to be improved in terms of plant availability and internal power recirculation. Present best fission plants have plant availability close to 95 % and internal power circulation of the order of 3 - 4 %. The operation and maintenance solutions of Model C and D show the right way for fusion. A remarkable rise of the fuel costs of present LWRs would make at first the Generation IV breeder options more competitive and thereafter fusion plants. The costs of safety related components, like containment and equipment for severe accident mitigatio...|$|R
40|$|This Rapid Prototyping Capability study {{explores the}} {{potential}} to use atmospheric profiles derived from GPS (Global Positioning System) radio occultation measurements and by AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) onboard the Aqua satellite to improve surface temperature retrieval from remotely sensed thermal imagery. This study demonstrates {{an example of a}} <b>cross-cutting</b> decision support <b>technology</b> whereby NASA data or models are shown to improve a wide number of observation systems or models. The ability to use one data source to improve others will be critical to the GEOSS (Global Earth Observation System of Systems) where a large number of potentially useful systems will require auxiliary datasets as input for decision support. Atmospheric correction of thermal imagery decouples TOA radiance and separates surface emission from atmospheric emission and absorption. Surface temperature can then be estimated from the surface emission with knowledge of its emissivity. Traditionally, radiosonde sounders or atmospheric models based on radiosonde sounders, such as the NOAA (National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration) ARL (Air Resources Laboratory) READY (Real-time Environmental Application and Display sYstem), provide the atmospheric profiles required to perform atmospheric correction. Unfortunately, these types of data are too spatially sparse and too infrequently taken. The advent of high accuracy, global coverage, atmospheric data using GPS radio occultation and AIRS may provide a new avenue for filling data input gaps. In this study, AIRS and GPS radio occultation derived atmospheric profiles from the German Aerospace Center CHAMP (CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload), the Argentinean Commission on Space Activities SAC-C (Satellite de Aplicaciones Cientificas-C), and the pair of NASA GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites are used as input data in atmospheric radiative transport modeling based on the MODTRAN (MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmittance) radiative transport software to separate out the atmospheric component of measured top of atmosphere radiance. Simulated water bodies across a variety of MODTRAN model atmospheres including desert, mid-latitude, tropical and sub-artic conditions provide test bed conditions. Atmospherically corrected radiance and surface temperature results were compared to those obtained using traditional radiosonde balloon data and models. In general, differences between the different techniques were less than 2 percent indicating the potential value satellite derived atmospheric profiles have to atmospherically correct thermal imagery...|$|R
