25|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{refers to}} the free movement of goods, capital, services, technology and information. It is the increasing economic integration and interdependence of national, regional, and local economies across the world through an intensification of <b>cross-border</b> <b>movement</b> of goods, services, technologies and capital. Whereas globalization is a broad set of processes concerning multiple networks of economic, political, and cultural interchange, contemporary economic globalization is propelled by the rapid growing significance of information in all types of productive activities and marketization, and by developments in science and technology.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{is the increasing}} economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in <b>cross-border</b> <b>movement</b> of goods, services, technology, and capital. Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic {{globalization is}} the process of increasing economic integration between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market. Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality.Likewise, it also comprises of globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace.Economic globalization also includes competition, technology, and corporations and industries.|$|E
25|$|Through {{successive}} enlargements, the Union {{has grown}} from the seven founding states—Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, and São Tomé and Príncipe—to the current nine, with the self-determination of Timor-Leste in 2002 and the accession of Equatorial Guinea in 2014 at the 10th summit in Dili, Timor-Leste with the issuance of the Dili Declaration. The community is growing from a cultural background to a geopolitical and economical community, as the CPLP is the fourth largest producer {{of oil in the}} world and the growing number of larger nations attempting to enter the organization, such as Turkey and Indonesia. In 2016, CPLP revised its cooperation protocol in defense, affirming the organization in the promotion of peace and security. In 2017, in Brasilia, the nine member states agreed to enlarge cooperation in matters of the seas, tourism, economy and a more ambitious defense and cooperation mechanisms. More rights to the observer states was also approved, which Argentina planned to join. Easing citizens <b>cross-border</b> <b>movement</b> between the member states was also proposed. This propose by Portugal and Cape Verde towards Brazil was thought by some to collide with Europe's Schengen area. However, this free movement is based in a different model: as residence permits, associated with the recognition of academic degrees and professional qualification, maintenance of social rights including pension systems. It would henceforth establish the Lusophone citizenship, the cidadania lusófona.|$|E

40|$|About the book: This book {{examines}} international labour migration, {{security and}} border-management strategies in Asia, {{in the face}} of intensified transnational economic and social processes and the expanding global governance regime. It argues that state policy pertaining to international migration is increasingly shaped by, and responds to, challenges such as border security, international agreements, civil society activism and new norms of global governnace. It focuses on policy responses to migrants and migration processes at the border and across borders, against the backdrop of four major challenges: - The regulation of populations and cross-border movements; - Security issues; - International agreements, and - New norms of global governnance develooped by regional and international NGOs and other international organizations. The book contributes to important debates about globalisation, international migration and issues of <b>cross-border</b> <b>movements.</b> It informs public discussion and policy development on issues of security and governnace and <b>cross-border</b> <b>movements</b> in Asia. ...|$|R

50|$|After Namibia's {{independence}} in 1990, the area previously known as Ovamboland {{was divided into}} the Ohangwena, Omusati, Oshana and Oshikoto Regions. The population, estimated at between 700,000 and 750,000, fluctuates remarkably.

40|$|Identifying {{human and}} malaria {{parasite}} movements {{is important for}} control planning across all transmission intensities. Imported infections can reintroduce infections into areas previously free of infection, maintain ‘hotspots’ of transmission and import drug resistant strains, challenging national control programmes {{at a variety of}} temporal and spatial scales. Recent analyses based on mobile phone usage data have provided valuable insights into population and likely parasite movements within countries, but these data are restricted to sub-national analyses, leaving important <b>cross-border</b> <b>movements</b> neglected. National census data were used to analyse and model <b>cross-border</b> migration and <b>movement,</b> using East Africa as an example. ‘Hotspots’ of origin-specific immigrants from neighbouring countries were identified for Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Populations of origin-specific migrants were compared to distance from origin country borders and population size at destination, and regression models were developed to quantify and compare differences in migration patterns. Migration data were then combined with existing spatially-referenced malaria data to compare the relative propensity for <b>cross-border</b> malaria <b>movement</b> in the region. The spatial patterns and processes for immigration were different between each origin and destination country pair. Hotspots of immigration, for example, were concentrated close to origin country borders for most immigrants to Tanzania, but for Kenya, a similar pattern was only seen for Tanzanian and Ugandan immigrants. Regression model fits also differed between specific migrant groups, with some migration patterns more dependent on population size at destination and distance travelled than others. With these differences between immigration patterns and processes, and heterogeneous transmission risk in East Africa and the surrounding region, propensities to import malaria infections also likely show substantial variations. This was a first attempt to quantify and model <b>cross-border</b> <b>movements</b> relevant to malaria transmission and control. With national census available worldwide, this approach can be translated to construct a cross-border human and malaria movement evidence base for other malaria endemic countries. The outcomes of this study will feed into wider efforts to quantify and model human and malaria movements in endemic regions to facilitate improved intervention planning, resource allocation and collaborative policy decisions. ...|$|R

Against this background, this paper analyses appropriate conflicts rules in international family relations to reflect an individual’s identity. Furthermore, in light of the contemporary law fragmentation, this study also analyses interactions between state law and non-state cultural, religious or customary norms...|$|R
