5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large <b>controlled</b> burns in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was {{consumed}} in 1988. <b>Controlled</b> burns would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than <b>controlled</b> burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by <b>controlled</b> burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|E

Both armies <b>controlled</b> most of the north and east of Yemen, {{including}} the towns of Harib and Marib. The provincial capital of Northern Yemen, Sadah, which would have given the Imam a key strategic road towards the main capital San'a, was <b>controlled</b> by the republicans. There were also areas like the town of Hajjah, where the royalists <b>controlled</b> the mountains while the Egyptians and republicans <b>controlled</b> the town and fortress. Mercenaries from France, Belgium and England, who had fought in Rhodesia, Malaya, Indochina and Algeria, were sent to assist the Imam in planning, training and giving the irregular forces the ability to communicate with one another and the Saudis. They trained tribesmen in the use of antitank weapons, such as the 106mm gun and in mining techniques. The numbers of mercenaries are estimated in the hundreds, although Egyptian sources at the time reported 15,000. Royalist tactics were confined to guerilla warfare, isolating conventional Egyptian and republican forces, and conducting attacks on supply lines.|$|E
