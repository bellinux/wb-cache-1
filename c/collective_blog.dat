40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{blogging}} web sites {{have become more}} sophisticated and influential than ever. Much of this sophistication and influence follows from their network organization. Blogging social networks (BSNs) allow individual bloggers to form contact lists, subscribe to other blogs, comment on blog posts, declare interests, and participate in <b>collective</b> <b>blogs.</b> Thus, a BSN is a bimodal venue, where users can engage in publishing (post) {{as well as in}} social (make friends) activities. In this paper, we study the co-evolution of both activities. We observed a significant positive correlation between blogging and socializing. In addition, we identified a number of user archetypes that correspond to "mainly bloggers," "mainly socializers," etc. We analyzed a BSN at the level of individual posts and changes in contact lists and at the level of trajectories in the friendship-publishing space. Both approaches produced consistent results: the majority of BSN users are passive readers; publishing is the dominant active behavior in a BSN; and social activities complement blogging, rather than compete with it.

50|$|While {{explicitly}} {{not suggesting}} that all these “strands” of this sector submerge their differences and unite in some large organization, which is seen by WiC as both unrealistic and even undesirable, they do support an intermediate position between that extreme and the other, of exclusionist hostility. On that basis, {{they do not see}} themselves as rivals to any group in the sector and some members belong to one or other such groups. Nor do they see themselves, in any sense, as a political party. Among the members currently are self-identified council communists, anarcho-socialists, DeLeonists, libertarian socialists, and world socialists, both with and without organised affiliations to their political positions. World in Common was established to provide a meeting ground for the different groups and individuals within the sector as well as a means of facilitating practical collaboration between them at some level, while recognizing that there are sharp differences of opinion on many different subjects within our sector but what they do not feel has been sufficiently recognised - and celebrated - is just how much these groups have in common with each other. It is these commonalities that are, in fact, rather more significant than the issues that divide us which the World in Common network attempts to highlight by means of various websites, internet discussion groups, an occasional journal, Common Voice (2005), a <b>collective</b> <b>blog,</b> and various real world interactions with the various elements making up the “impossibilist” non-market political sector, whether they prefer the term anarchist, communist, socialist.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a critical investigation of ‘intercultural digital media’ in Italy from 2000 to 2016. In this, {{it focuses on}} the diverse digital media platforms (largely web-portals and <b>collective</b> <b>blogs)</b> that have offered alternatives to mainstream media discourses of immigration and cultural diversity in Italy, and which have involved people of immigrant background as media producers. Through a focused, in-depth study of website content mainly published in 2014, including mission statements, thematic structures and discursive strategies, {{as well as the}} contextual and organisational structures, processes and roles of content producers and editors, the thesis offers a critical insight into the discourse of intercultural digital media in practice. Combining Critical Discourse and Multimodal Analysis approaches with Cultural Studies and digital citizenship theories of identity, representation and belonging, the research aims to explore the possibilities for constructing alternative, ‘intercultural’ discourse through these platforms. In investigating how intercultural discourse can be variously articulated within different modes such as journalism, self-representation and citizenship advocacy, the analysis engages closely with the strategic, organising idea of the ‘new Italians’, and raises broader questions about the cultural politics of under-represented groups seeking inclusion and recognition as ‘citizens’ in increasingly diverse societies...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that new social media {{produces}} new forms of public geography and digital praxis in which the relationship between reader and writer is radically altered and which enables geographers to engage in timely conversation and debate with the public on unfolding issues, and provides new avenues to connect with older forms of broadcast media. Social media can strengthen geographers engagement with the existing fourth estate and forge new relationships with an emerging fifth estate – dynamic, responsive and empowered publics. We illustrate such potentials by drawing on our own experiences of contributing to IrelandAfterNAMA, a <b>collective</b> <b>blog</b> that provides critical analysis of the present crisis in Ireland which has established a regular readership and has led to significant media work (over 500 newspaper articles and radio and television interviews). Such public geography projects are not without their challenges and pitfalls, not least because they alter and challenge {{the ways in which}} academics work, communicate and are assessed. Nevertheless, we believe that at the very least their quotidian practices enact what Macgilchrist and Bohmig (2012 : 97) term ‘minimal politics’, creating ‘tiny fissures in the mediascape’ that inform and engage with wider publics in ways that academic articles rarely do and work to challenge hegemonic formations...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} the Internet by social movements in Morocco {{and the extent to which}} it has empowered them in various struggles against political and social injustices. More specifically, it explores whether the Internet has transformed the collective action repertoire and enhanced social movements’ capacity to challenge Morocco’s semi-authoritarian regime and erode the hegemonic social orders in the country. In so doing, the thesis addresses some key polemical issues and questions germane to the topic, mainly the dialectic between technological and social determinisms and agency, the role of technology in development, and collective action and democratic change in the context of Muslim-majority societies. The thesis uses a combination of methodological approaches to explore the structural, textual and contextual dimensions of the Internet’s implications and impact. Through feature analysis, and framing analysis, the research studies 18 websites, <b>collective</b> <b>blogs</b> and wikis belonging to eight key Moroccan social movements. It equally draws on rich data derived from 37 semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted with Moroccan social movement activists, journalists and international NGOs’ officials. It offers insights into the embeddedness of the Internet as a technology and medium, and into the interplay between activists’ and users’ practices and their social environment and physical world. Moreover, using a multidisciplinary conceptual framework, namely social movement theory, the social study of technology, alternative media studies, radical democracy theory and community informatics, the thesis {{examines the}} complex and multilayered interconnections between the Internet and the various social, economic and cultural processes shaping its appropriation and its potential for social change. It concludes that the Internet plays a significant role in enhancing Moroccan social movements’ collective action capabilities by favouring various forms of mobilization, and facilitating linkages between dispersed constituencies and translocal public spheres. The thesis argues, however, that the medium does not impact in any radical way the dominant political and social orders inasmuch as its implications and potential remain considerably limited by the various digital divides, and are mediated through the power relations characterizing society. ...|$|R
40|$|The use Web 2. 0 {{technologies}} and specifically blogs {{has become increasingly}} prevalent within the Higher Education (HE) sector within recent years as educators begin to maximise the opportunities such tools can provide for teaching and learning and to experiment with their usage {{in a wide range}} of context. The use of such technologies has been shown to promote learning (Garcia, Brown & Elbeltagi, 2012) however currently the manner in which these tools can be best used to promote teaching and learning is not entirely clear. It is within this context that Connectivism, a learning theory for the digital age (Siemens, 2004) has been developed as a theory which aims to provide a model through which teaching and learning using digital technologies can be better understood and managed. Connectivism is however as yet still a relatively new learning theory and not without criticism. Therefore this theory must be considered more fully before it can be accepted fully as a learning theory for the digital age. Within this research a case study of <b>collective</b> <b>blog</b> usage by students studying at an HE institution within the United Kingdom is utilised in order to explore the extent to which Connectivism can be considered to provide a sound theoretical model in which to base future teaching and learning activities of this sort. The views of academic staff and students are utilised in order to explore the extent to which the model of Connectivist learning can be applied to this case and demonstrate the complexities of considering teaching and learning in this way. The results of this study would suggest that Connectivism as a learning theory for the digital age is worthy of consideration and a number of elements of the theory can be seen within the activities undertaken however these are not seen universally across all groups involved within this project...|$|E
40|$|L'accompagnement des futurs enseignants sur leur lieu de stage par le biais d'outils de {{communication}} en ligne a tendance à se développer. Les objectifs sont divers. D'une manière générale, il s'agit de rompre le sentiment d'isolement, d'encourager l'entraide, le soutien, de développer des formes de collaboration, etc. Depuis septembre 2004, un dispositif similaire est en place à l'université Stendhal de Grenoble en deuxième année de master de FLE. L'objectif toutefois est différent : mettre à la disposition des étudiants un espace d'expression, en l'occurrence un blog collectif, pour soutenir &# 34;l'élaboration de leur identité professionnelle naissante&# 34; (Rinaudo, 2006  : 175). En prenant comme cadre d'analyse la notion d'ethos, et en utilisant les outils d'analyse fournis par l'analyse des discours et des situations de travail, je me propose de rendre compte dans cet article des différentes postures (ou ethos) adoptées par les étudiants. J'en dénombre quatre : ethos &# 34;étudiant&# 34;, ethos &# 34;enseignant stagiaire&# 34;, ethos &# 34;enseignant normatif&# 34;, ethos &# 34;enseignant citoyen&# 34;. There {{are more}} and more examples of schemes to support trainee teachers in the workplace through online blogs. These may have a variety of objectives. Generally, the aim is to break the feeling of isolation, encourage mutual assistance and support, develop new forms of collaboration, etc. Since September 2004, such a scheme has been in operation at Stendhal University in Grenoble, in the 2 nd year of a postgraduate course in French-as-a-foreign-language. However, the aim is different: to give students a space for self-expression and in this case a <b>collective</b> <b>blog,</b> to help the &# 34;elaboration of their emerging professional identity&# 34; (Rinaudo, 2006). Taking the concept of ethos as a frame of analysis and using the tools provided by discourse analysis as applied to workplace discourses, I will try in this article to account for the different positions (or &# 34;ethos&# 34;) adopted by students. I can distinguish four of them: the &# 34;student ethos&# 34;, the &# 34;trainee teacher ethos&# 34;, the &# 34;normative teacher ethos&# 34; and the &# 34;citizen teacher ethos&# 34;...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{classical}} and traditional methods have proven effective in seizing on {{foreign language skills}} by pupils and students, new means of communication and dissemination of information - in the virtual world via Internet - are continuous and opportune challenges towards progress. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to question the effectiveness of new instruments - namely the blog - for conveying and assimilating the skills necessary for communicating in another language. We live in a world in which a wide range of public figures stemming from diverse environments, such as the academia, mass-media, political and cultural environment, etc. use this tool - the blog - in order to present in a personal manner their knowledge or opinions, to promote a different kind of dialogue with their readers, with the audience, with their constituency or with those interested in the proposed topics. The journalist and the blogger are often tantamount. Great online publications have a blog button on their site. In such conditions, is the blog a practical tool for both the teacher and the economy student learning a new language? A series of pertinent questions are posed: to which extent can the blog be used as an instrument in teaching and learning a foreign language? Is the virtual platform a proper place for designing, displaying and posting both practical and theoretical topics? If preparing such a topic - at an economy student's hands - entails a significant effort as a self-taught, is this effort best assessed when presenting a paper before a professor, in the interaction between the two, which coincides with the evaluation and assessment of the student's work? While the information content is taught the same for all students, regarding one on one assimilation and evaluation, could an individual blog - moderated by the student - or a <b>collective</b> <b>blog</b> in which all students have access be more appropriate? Is the use of a virtual platform more effective than other traditional methods of language acquisition? All these questions are legitimate and we propose to formulate answers highlighting our opinion in the following lines. Together with traditional approaches to teaching and learning, the use of a virtual platform in acquiring linguistic skills secure attractiveness, novelty and a beneficial, peculiar dynamic...|$|E
40|$|Although they {{represent}} the majority of bloggers, personal bloggers who follow the diaristic genre are underrepresented in academic studies of blogging. Arguing against the dichotomies of ‘real’ and ‘virtual’ spaces, gift vs. the market economy, and authenticity vs. inauthenticity, this research explores how these are illuminated by {{an analysis of the}} effects of monetisation on the affordances and related practices of personal blogging. Based on participant observation over three years, this thesis uses data derived from maintaining two blogs, participating in on- and offline <b>blogging</b> <b>collective</b> practices, in-depth interviews, and a survey, to investigate the effects of monetisation on personal blogging in Malaysia. Most of the participant observation was attending events organised by a blog advertising network (known here as BlogAdNet) that coincidentally started about the same time the research started. BlogAdNet proved to be successful in mobilising bloggers and advertisers {{in order to create a}} market for advertising on personal blogs, and therefore also provides a good case study for investigating the interaction between a previously mostly non-monetised blogging assemblage, and the market economy – in particular the advertising industry. The methodological approach is informed by actor-network theory, emphasising tracing empirical connections and allowing for non-human agency within networks of sociotechnical devices. The theoretical frameworks that have proved helpful in explaining the <b>collective</b> <b>blogging</b> and market related practices are derived from Deleuze & Guattari’s concepts of rhizomatic assemblages, and also Manuel DeLanda’s further development of the social assemblage. These are used to allow for individual agency, whilst not overlooking nonhuman agency and emergent properties of dynamic systems. Within this framework, the blog is conceived as a sociotechnical dialogical medium that enables interpersonal interaction, and emergent collective practices. These are understood to be enabled by base and emergent affordances that offer the potential of causal relations between relevant actors and actants and thus stabilise a contingent ‘blogging assemblage’. To situate and analyse the effects of monetisation, and the influence of advertising, Michel Callon’s notions of the ‘economy of qualities’ and related ‘overflows’ are drawn upon, and further extensions of those concepts by Don Slater and Mark Foster to understand the interaction and entanglement of socioeconomic components. This thesis proposes that bloggers can be understood as engaging in polycasting, and the blog is described as a dialogical medium that enables extended parasocial relations. It concludes by drawing upon arguments based on the relational self that run counter to the assumption of the unitary self inherent in the modern authentic self. In addition, an emergent genre of blogging, the lifestyle blog, is seen as a result of the monetisation of personal blogging. Its emergence results from the sociotechnical processes that have taken place in order to entangle the bloggers and their audience with marketing and advertising strategies aimed at developing social assemblages that include their goods and brands...|$|R
