5|$|Most {{stations}} on the Bloor–Danforth line have side platforms; however, {{there are}} still a few stations which use a <b>centre</b> <b>platform</b> instead. At the surface, some stations are designed {{to be a part of}} the shopping area which are located above the subway. Other stations are large facilities on the surface which also contain bus and/or streetcar platforms to allow transfers to take place.|$|E

25|$|First {{pioneered by}} Olton and Samuelson in 1976, the radial arm maze is {{designed}} to test the spatial memory capabilities of rats. Mazes are typically designed with a <b>centre</b> <b>platform</b> and a varying number of arms branching off with food placed at the ends. The arms are usually shielded {{from each other in}} some way but not to the extent that external cues cannot be used as reference points.|$|E

25|$|Kipling station, in {{what was}} then the Borough of Etobicoke, officially opened on November 21, 1980, but not until the {{following}} day was it opened to the public, along with Kennedy station as part of east-west extensions to the Bloor-Danforth line. Kipling and Kennedy were designed similarly, with both stations having a <b>centre</b> <b>platform</b> allowing trains to stop at either side. The platform walls in Kipling are yellow with black stripes and show the station's name in Univers.|$|E
500|$|Elisenberg {{is located}} {{approximately}} halfway between Nationaltheatret Station and Skøyen Station in the Oslo Tunnel of the Drammen Line. It is located under Balchens gate, near the tram {{stop with the}} same name. All that has been built at Elisenberg Station is the <b>centre</b> <b>platform,</b> which is [...] long and [...] wide, and a passageway across the south track. The tracks lay [...] below the surface.|$|E
2500|$|In 1881 {{platforms}} 4 to 6 (Platform 5 being a bay to the south) were added, being [...] {{long and}} [...] wide. The level crossing which gave access from platform 1 to platform 2 was removed and access {{provided by a}} new footbridge [...] wide with staircases down to each platform. Platforms 2 and 3 were lengthened by about [...] and new waiting rooms and refreshment rooms were provided, designed by the company architect John Holloway Sanders. A subway was installed to allow better transfer of luggage between platforms with hydraulic lifts to raise and lower luggage. The turntables were removed and replaced by scissors crossovers, the whole complex controlled by a signal box on the <b>centre</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E

50|$|The station {{consists}} of two island platforms - a city-bound platform and an outbound <b>platform.</b> The two <b>centre</b> <b>platforms</b> - platforms 2 & 3 - serve the Epping to Chatswood line.

50|$|As at {{the nearby}} Montreux railway station, access to the main {{platform}} is from {{the first floor of}} the station building, instead of the ground floor. The track system comprises one side and two <b>centre</b> <b>platforms,</b> along with some goods tracks.|$|R
60|$|Everything {{about my}} tragedy has been hideous, mean, repellent, lacking in style; our very dress makes us grotesque. We are the zanies of sorrow. We are clowns whose hearts are broken. We are {{specially}} designed {{to appeal to}} the sense of humour. On November 13th, 1895, I was brought down here from London. From two o'clock till half-past two on that day I had to stand on the <b>centre</b> <b>platform</b> of Clapham Junction in convict dress, and handcuffed, for the world to look at. I had been taken out of the hospital ward without a moment's notice being given to me. Of all possible objects I was the most grotesque. When people saw me they laughed. Each train as it came up swelled the audience. Nothing could exceed their amusement. That was, of course, before they knew who I was. As soon as they had been informed they laughed still more. For half an hour I stood there in the grey November rain surrounded by a jeering mob.|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} on the {{principle}} of the Spanish solution, whereas the <b>centre</b> <b>platform</b> would be using for the arriving passengers only and the side platforms for departing passengers only. The separation was enforced by access controls to the <b>centre</b> <b>platform</b> (discontinued in 1960s), location of ticket offices next to side platforms only, and opening trains' doors on the <b>centre</b> <b>platform</b> side first and on the side platform side with a delay. The separation was in operation until the 1980s.|$|E

5000|$|Proposals {{to build}} an {{underground}} station, Victoria Low Level {{as part of the}} Picc-Vic tunnel project emerged in the early-1970s.
