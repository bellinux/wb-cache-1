25|$|It {{is clear}} {{now that the}} present {{situation}} cannot be allowed to continue. It is evident also that the Stormont government {{is no longer in}} control of the situation. Indeed, the present situation is the inevitable outcome of the policies pursued for decades by successive Stormont governments. It is clear also that the Irish Government can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse. It is obvious that the RUC is no longer accepted as an impartial police force. Neither would the employment of British troops be acceptable nor would they be likely to restore peaceful conditions, <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the long term. The Irish Government have, therefore, requested the British Government to apply immediately to the United Nations for the urgent dispatch of a Peace-Keeping Force to the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and have instructed the Permanent Representative to the United Nations to inform the Secretary General of this request. We have also asked the British Government {{to see to it that}} police attacks on the people of Derry should cease immediately.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{dancing is}} a strong {{influence}} {{in many of the}} books. From Girls of the Hamlet Club (1914) and At School with the Roundheads (1915) until The Girls of the Abbey School (1921), it was shown as a fairly easy thing for girls to do, and to teach each other. By the time of The Abbey Girls Go Back to School (1922) it is apparent that Oxenham herself had come into contact with the English Folk Dance Society and realised that the dances were not so simple after all. The books written from this time for the next six years or so, until Abbey Girls Win Through (1928) depict members of the EFDS hierarchy with affection and almost reverence. It seems that something happened to spoil this relationship, as after 1930 these characters do not appear in the books, and are hardly referred to again, <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> such glowing terms. The EFDS makes a brief appearance in An Abbey Champion (1946), but the personnel are no longer named. It may have been as simple as the move to Worthing and the impossibility of maintaining as close a friendship at a distance of some sixty miles, but it has been conjectured that 'Madam' (Helen Kennedy North) and 'The Pixie' (Daisy Caroline Daking) may have objected to the way they were being portrayed. Oxenham never lost the love of folk dancing itself, however, and always shows it as a healthy form of exercise, and a way of lifting oneself out of depression.|$|E
500|$|Nigel Kneale {{himself was}} largely dismissive of the serial {{in the years}} {{following}} its broadcast; [...] "God knows it wasn't a very important sort of thing," [...] he told his biographer. [...] "The BBC didn't care tuppence about what they were doing, because they really don't know what they're doing, <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> radio... must have been pretty ill when this nonsense was going on." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{their history}} in the competition, Liverpool manager Roy Evans, felt this would not count for {{anything}} in the final: [...] "Our players haven't really got that much Wembley experience, <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> terms of finals. It {{will be good for}} us to have Ian Rush and John Barnes out there." [...] Striker Rush had picked up a hamstring injury while playing for the Welsh national team against Bulgaria, but was expected to be fit. Midfielder Mark Kennedy would not feature in the final as he was ineligible.|$|E
500|$|In a 1995 Wall Street Journal column, Paul Gigot {{described}} Higgins as an [...] "idea broker," [...] {{explaining that}} she {{prefers not to}} be associated with political parties. Gigot included a quotation from her, in which she stated, [...] "I am not really interested in a party.... If the Democrats had really been New Democrats, that would have been great. If these Republicans become Old Republicans, they'll lose me too." [...] William Galston, a senior domestic policy adviser in the Clinton administration, said, [...] "I see Heather as an intellectual and policy entrepreneur with some real moral commitments.... I don't see her as a sharply partisan figure, <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the way she deals with people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Now it is {{possible}} that wants and the exercise of faculties have entered in some manner into the production of the phenomena which we have been considering; but <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the way suggested by Lamarck, whose whole notion is obviously so inadequate to account for the rise of the organic kingdoms, that we only can place it with pity among the follies of the wise.

Script Ohio was first performed by The Ohio State Marching Band on October 24, 1936, at the Ohio State versus Indiana University football game. According to The Ohio State University Library, a similar floating formation was first performed during the 1932 season by the University of Michigan Marching Band., but <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the complex form {{it takes on}} now with the OSU band." ...|$|E

By late April 1945, the course {{continued to}} take place in Krün, a municipality in Southern Bavaria, adjacent to Tyrol. When Hitler's suicide became known on 30 April, the course came to an end. Before relieving the officers of their duties, Larisch assembled them in the local schoolhouse. His parting words were: [...] "What you have learned in the past weeks was <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> vain, for just a few years from now, there will be a new German Army!" ...|$|E

Yulia and I are working on our projects now. I, for one, will be traveling to Los Angeles this Saturday, where I will keep working on my album. And I'm preparing a big show in San Francisco in September, so now we are not planning to reform t.A.T.u., <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the near future.

2500|$|Gaston's age is {{a mystery}} - Franquin himself confessed that he neither knew nor indeed wanted to know it. [...] Although Gaston has a job, a car and his own place, he often acts like a young teenager. In the {{publication}} of Dossier Franquin Franquin had said that Gaston is a boy in his late teens but <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> his twenties. He is invariably dressed in a tight polo-necked green jumper and blue-jeans, and worn-out espadrilles. It is said that his appearance was originally based on that of Yvan Delporte, editor of the Journal de Spirou at that time. Also, in his first gags, Gaston was an avid cigarette smoker, but his habit was slowly phased out.|$|E
2500|$|Healy {{official}}ly entered {{office as}} Governor-General on 6 December 1922. He never wore, <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> public in Ireland, the official ceremonial uniform of a Governor-General in the British Empire. At that time, in the 1920s, Healy was unique amongst viceregal {{representatives in the}} British Empire in this regard. Healy was also unique (along with his successor, James McNeill) amongst all the Governors-General in the British Empire in the 1920s in that he was never sworn in {{as a member of}} the Imperial Privy Council. [...] Nor was he ever sworn into the Privy Council of Ireland, a body that ceased to exist in early December 1922. Thus, unusually for a Governor-General within the Empire, he never gained the prefix 'The Right Honourable' nor the post-nominals 'PC'.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2011, {{days before}} the release of The Hangover Part II, {{director}} Todd Phillips said that [...] "there already are plans for a third film but no script or start date". About the possibility of The Hangover Part III, Phillips stated, [...] "If we were to do a third one, if the audience, if the desire was there, I {{think we have a}} very clear idea where that would head. It's <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the same template that you've seen these movies. The third would be very much a finale and an ending. The most I could say about it, what's in my head, and I haven't discussed it with these actors, {{is that it is not}} following that template but very much a new idea. As far as where it takes place, I said I'm very open." [...] Also during May, Craig Mazin, who co-wrote The Hangover Part II, entered early talks to write the script for the third installment.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{it was a}} major {{political}} victory for the Catholic Monarchs by assuring to Isabella the throne of Castile:]] Spanish historian Julián María Rubio: [...] "The solution of this conflict is also similar to the previous one. The indecisive battle of Toro, which was <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> its results and consequences, puts an end to the indubitable [...] "Portuguese danger" [...] to Castile", in , Voluntad, Madrid, 1927, Volume I de Manuales Hispania, [...]]] Spanish historian Rafael Ballester y Castell: “The King of Portugal simply remained on the defensive; the first March 1476, he was attacked by Ferdinand of Aragon in front of the town of Toro. The battle was indecisive, but [...] the supporters of the Catholic Monarchs asserting their superiority, the Portuguese King withdrew" [...] in , Payot, 1928, [...] The remnants of the nobles loyal to Juana de Trastámara adhered to Isabella. With great political vision, Isabella took advantage of the moment and summoned the 'Cortes' at Madrigal-Segovia (April–October 1476).]] Marvin Lunenfeld: “In 1476, immediately after the indecisive battle of Peleagonzalo, Ferdinand and Isabella hailed the result as a great victory and called the 'Cortes' at Madrigal. The newly created prestige was used to gain municipal support from their allies...” in , University of Miami Press, 1970, p.27. There her daughter was proclaimed and sworn heiress of the [...] Castile's crown, which was equivalent to legitimizing her own throne.|$|E
