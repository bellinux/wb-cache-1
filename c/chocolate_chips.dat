25|$|A 2011 {{controlled}} {{study found}} that rats are actively prosocial. They demonstrate apparent altruistic behaviour to other rats in experiments, including freeing them from cages: when presented with readily available <b>chocolate</b> <b>chips,</b> test subjects would first free the caged rat, and then share the food. All female rats in the study displayed this behaviour, while 30% of the males did not.|$|E
500|$|Even further {{variations}} of hot chocolate exist. In some cafes in Belgium {{and other areas}} in Europe, one who orders a [...] "warme chocolade" [...] or [...] "chocolat chaud" [...] receives a cup of steaming white milk and a small bowl of bittersweet <b>chocolate</b> <b>chips</b> to dissolve in the milk. [...] One Viennese variant Heiße Schokolade Wiener Art contains an egg yolk for thickness.|$|E

50|$|Example: A bakery markets {{a single}} plain cookie for $2. However, {{they decide to}} {{introduce}} a new <b>chocolate</b> <b>chip</b> cookie for $3. The plain cookies made 100 sales a day before the <b>chocolate</b> <b>chip</b> cookie was launched. On {{the first month of}} launch, the <b>chocolate</b> <b>chip</b> cookie makes 50 sales a day. However the bakery should not expect to make $350, as what will most likely happen is that a portion of the people who bought the <b>chocolate</b> <b>chip</b> cookie will be plain cookie buyers who will have opted for the second product. Hypothesise that the cannibalisation rate is of 60%.|$|R

500|$|As both {{a play on}} {{his last}} name, and the {{pronunciation}} of his first and last names together, [...] "Wacha Wacha" [...] became a phenomenon in 2013 following the favorite catch phrase of Fozzie Bear of The Muppets, and for its similarity to the sound effects from the Pac-Man arcade game. [...] A restaurant in St. Louis named a milkshake the [...] "Wacha Wacha" [...] following his 2013 NLCS MVP honors. [...] The milkshake's ingredients included vanilla with <b>chocolate</b> <b>chips</b> and Cracker Jacks. [...] Although {{he could not remember}} the name of the restaurant (believed to be Fozzie's), he stated the Cracker Jacks [...] "added a little baseball flair to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{chocolate}} chip cookie is a drop cookie which features <b>chocolate</b> <b>chips</b> as its distinguishing ingredient. The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter and both brown and white sugar with semi-sweet <b>chocolate</b> <b>chips.</b> Ruth Wakefield of Whitman, Massachusetts invented <b>chocolate</b> <b>chips</b> and {{chocolate chip}} cookies in 1930. Her new cookie invention was called the [...] "Toll House Cookie" [...] which used broken-up bars of semi-sweet chocolate.|$|E

[...] Today, 80 million of the candies are produced each day. [...] Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925), containing peanuts in milk chocolate, Hershey's Syrup (1926), semisweet <b>chocolate</b> <b>chips</b> (1928), and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice (1938).|$|E

50|$|A {{chocolate}} chip cookie is a drop cookie that {{originated in the}} United States and features <b>chocolate</b> <b>chips</b> (small morsels of sweetened chocolate) as its distinguishing ingredient. The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter and both brown and white sugar, semi-sweet <b>chocolate</b> <b>chips</b> and vanilla. Variations include recipes {{with other types of}} chocolate as well as additional ingredients such as nuts or oatmeal. There are also vegan versions with ingredient substitutions such as vegan <b>chocolate</b> <b>chips,</b> vegan margarine, and so forth.|$|E
