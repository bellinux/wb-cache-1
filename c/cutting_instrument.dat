60|$|The Princess Amalia Seraphina, a {{daughter}} of the Grand-Ducal house of Toggenburg-Tannhäuser, would be equally inconsiderable if she were not a <b>cutting</b> <b>instrument</b> {{in the hands of}} an ambitious man. She is much younger than the Prince, a girl of two-and-twenty, sick with vanity, superficially clever, and fundamentally a fool. She has a red-brown rolling eye, too large for her face, and with sparks of both levity and ferocity; her forehead is high and narrow, her figure thin and a little stooping. Her manners, her conversation, which she interlards with French, her very tastes and ambitions, are alike assumed, and the assumption is ungracefully apparent: Hoyden playing Cleopatra. I should judge her to be incapable of truth. In private life a girl of this description embroils the peace of families, walks attended by a troop of scowling swains, and passes, once at least, through the divorce court; it is a common and, except to the cynic, an uninteresting type. On the throne, however, and in the hands of a man like Gondremark, she may become the authoress of serious public evils.|$|E

50|$|Another {{characteristic}} of Bengali food {{is the use}} of a <b>cutting</b> <b>instrument,</b> the boti (also called the dao in some regional dialects). South Indians also use the same sort of <b>cutting</b> <b>instrument,</b> where it is called katti peeta. It is a long curved blade on a platform held down by foot; both hands are used to hold whatever is being cut and move it against the blade. The method gives effective control over the cutting process, and can be used to cut anything from tiny shrimp to large pumpkins. Knives are rare in a traditional Bengali kitchen.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} epidemiological {{factors for}} HCV infection associated with sharing perforating and <b>cutting</b> <b>instruments</b> among candidates for blood donation (CBD) {{in the city}} of Bel&# 233;m, Par&# 225;, Brazilian Amazon. Two definitions of HCV infection cases were used: anti-HCV positivity shown by EIA, and HCV-RNA detection by PCR. Infected and uninfected CBD completed a questionnaire about possible risk factors associated with sharing perforating and <b>cutting</b> <b>instruments.</b> The information was evaluated using simple and multiple logistic regressions. Between May and November 2010, 146 (1. 1 %) persons with anti-HCV antibodies and 106 (0. 8 %) with HCV-RNA were detected among 13, 772 CBD in Bel&# 233;m. Risk factors associated with HCV infection based on the EIA (model 1) and PCR (model 2) results were: use of needles and syringes sterilized at home; shared use of razors at home, sharing of disposable razors in barbershops, beauty salons etc.; and sharing manicure and pedicure material. The models of HCV infection associated with sharing perforating and <b>cutting</b> <b>instruments</b> should be taken into account by local and regional health authorities and by those of other countries with similar cultural practices, in order to provide useful information to guide political and public strategies to control HCV transmission...|$|R

30|$|No {{systematic}} reviews on pain {{related to}} laparoscopic port instruments were found. A total of seven RCTs evaluated postoperative pain after {{the use of}} REA instruments to standard port instruments for primary and/or secondary port entry.

40|$|Goals: To {{identify}} {{factors associated}} with occupational accidents caused by piercing and <b>cutting</b> <b>instruments</b> and to identify the consequences of these accidents. Methods: Descriptive field research. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews with nurses who suffered accidents during one year in four hospitals at São Paulo State - Brazil. Results: {{factors associated with}} accidents were: work overload, poor quality material, inadequate disposal materials, professional negligence, clients’ aggressiveness, lack of attention and use of unsheathed needles. The accidents caused financial damages to the institutions as well as emotional and physical impairments to workers. Conclusions: There are several factors associated with accidents with piercing and <b>cutting</b> <b>instruments.</b> Therefore, preventive measures must be implemented according to the peculiarities of each work environment. Better care should be taken with {{the preparation of the}} professionals {{as well as with the}} information on risks from exposure to body/blood fluids they are given.

The device at Grand Central Terminal was found and taken to NYPD Rodman's Neck Firing Range where police attempted to dismantle it rather than detonate it. After setting a <b>cutting</b> <b>instrument</b> on the two wires attached to the device, the officers retreated from the pit for several minutes. They then returned to the pit to continue dismantling the device when it exploded and killed an officer, Brian Murray, and wounded another. Meanwhile, the hijacked plane headed for Paris.

5000|$|One of {{the best-known}} {{features}} of paravians {{is the presence of}} an enlarged and strongly curved [...] "sickle claw" [...] on a hyper-extendible second toe, modified to hold the sickle claw clear of the ground when walking, most notably developed in the dromaeosaurids and troodontids. While this characteristic claw and its associated modifications to the anatomy of the foot (such as a shortened metatarsus in eudromaeosaurs) had been known since the mid-20th century, their possible functions were the subject mainly of speculation, and few actual studies were published. Initial speculation regarded the claws as slashing implements used to disembowel large prey. In this scenario, the shortened upper foot would serve as an anchor point for powerful tendons to improve kicking ability. However, subsequent studies of the actual claw shape showed that the underside of the claw was only weakly keeled and would not have been an effective <b>cutting</b> <b>instrument.</b> Instead, it appeared {{to be more of a}} hooking implement. Manning et al. suggested in 2006 that the claws were similar to crampons and were used for climbing, and in the case of larger species or individuals, climbing up the flanks of very large prey.|$|E
5000|$|A {{legal case}} in the English Criminal Courts has held that a {{grapefruit}} knife is, in fact, a knife. It is illegal under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to sell knives to persons under 18. Trading Standards officers of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead brought charges in East Berkshire Magistrates' Court against W J Daniel and Company Limited, one of whose employees had sold a grapefruit knife to a test purchaser {{under the age of}} 16 on 17 February 2009. The magistrates were persuaded that it was not, in fact, a knife but a [...] "gadget" [...] and duly dismissed the case. At an appeal in the High Court, Sir Anthony May found that this was wrong. Using the definition of [...] "knife" [...] in the Oxford English Dictionary ("A <b>cutting</b> <b>instrument</b> consisting of a blade with a sharpened longitudinal edge fixed in a handle either rigidly, as in a table knife, carving or sheath knife, or with a joint, as in a pocket or clasp knife. The blade is generally of steel, but sometimes of other material, as in the silver fish and fruit knives, the blunt edged paper knife of ivory, wood, etcetera, and the flint knives of early man.") which, he said, accorded with his own understanding, he ruled that a grapefruit knife was indeed a knife within the meaning of the Act and upheld the appeal. The case was remitted to the magistrates to continue the hearing.|$|E

5000|$|On September 10, 1976, a {{group of}} Croatian nationalists led by Zvonko Bušić, his wife Julienne and two others hijacked TWA Flight 355 from LaGuardia to Chicago. Bušić {{delivered}} a note to the captain in which he informed him that the airplane was hijacked, the group had five gelignite bombs on board, and another bomb was planted in a locker in Grand Central Terminal in New York with further instructions. During the hijacking the device at Grand Central Terminal was found and taken to Rodman's Neck Firing Range where police attempted to dismantle it rather than detonate it. After setting a <b>cutting</b> <b>instrument</b> on the two wires attached to the device, the officers retreated from the pit for several minutes. They {{then returned to the}} pit to continue dismantling the device when it exploded and killed an officer, Brian Murray. Bušić and his accomplices were arrested when the plane arrived in Paris. Bušić was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment but was eventually paroled. The similarities between the Grand Central bomb and the LaGuardia bomb led personnel involved in the investigation to believe that Bušić was responsible for the bombing or at least had some involvement. [...] However no charges for the crime were ever brought forward and Bušić vigorously denied any involvement. [...] Speaking after his release in 2008, Bušić said “to this day, have absolutely no knowledge about who did it" [...] and [...] "It is inconceivable to me that I would have been granted parole if there was any evidence linking me to that horrible crime." [...] FBI officials also contacted the U.S. Parole Commission in September, 1997, in regard to Zvonko Busic's alleged involvement in the unresolved La Guardia case, stating that [...] "the La Guardia case remains a mystery, but {{there is no evidence that}} Busic was involved in that incident.
