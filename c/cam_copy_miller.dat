He loaned Glenn Miller money to launch Miller's successful band of 1938, but Dorsey saw the loan as an investment, entitling him to a percentage of Miller's income. When Miller balked at this, the angry Dorsey got even by sponsoring a new band led by Bob Chester, and hiring arrangers who deliberately <b>copied</b> <b>Miller's</b> style and sound. Dorsey branched out in the mid-1940s and owned two music publishing companies, Sun and Embassy. After opening at the Los Angeles ballroom, the Hollywood Palladium on the Palladium's first night, Dorsey's relations with the ballroom soured and he opened a competing ballroom, the Casino Gardens circa 1944.

The letters are set against landscapes that contain scenes chiefly from classical mythology, within rectangular borders of strapwork, figures, and grotesques. Some prints in Getty copy watermarked with a sun face; cf. Briquet 13956, 13959, 13960 (northern Italy, in use 1593 - 1606). Others are marked with a crossbow; cf. Briquet 763, 766, 767, 770 (northern Italy, in use 1583 - 1600). The watermarks thus suggest a printing date closer {{to the end of}} the 16 th century than to 1570, the conjectural date of first publication. Most sources call for 20 prints, though Bonacini and Thieme-Becker call for 24 and Guilmard reports copies with either 20 or 24. All prints but B and C bear "Con Priuilegio" or a variation. Additionally each print has a title in Italian engraved on the background which identifies the scene, and the figure in it whose name begins with the letter depicted on the plate.
