40|$|Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) is {{a common}} stored grain pest for which {{a wide range of}} {{suitable}} resources has been recorded. These beetles are facultatively fungivorous and their resource range may extend to fungi associated with non-grain resources (e. g. cotton seed) and other decaying plant matter. Little is known with respect to fungi in terms of resource location by these beetles in the field. We, therefore, conducted a series of experiments in laboratory arenas, glasshouse cages and the field to determine how beetles respond to grain resources in relation to cotton seed (together with its lint stubble and associated fungal flora). Results from the tests conducted in relatively small arenas and cages in the laboratory and glasshouse reveal that the responses of T. castaneum adults to food resources were twice as strong when walking as when flying (as measured by the proportion of the released beetles that were trapped). Also, a clear preference for <b>linted</b> <b>cotton</b> seeds was evident in walking T. castaneum, especially in small-scale arenas in the laboratory, where at least 60 % of beetles released preferred <b>linted</b> <b>cotton</b> seeds over wheat and sorghum. Similarly, in cages (1 m 3) they responded five times more strongly to <b>linted</b> <b>cotton</b> seed than to conventional grain resources. However, this pattern was not consistent with those obtained from field trapping over 20 m and the beetles did not show any particular preference to any of the resources tested above.

The {{government}} encouraged cotton production after the crop was nearly wiped out by the Paraguayan War. Cotton was especially suited to the Paraguayan climate and soils and was grown primarily by small farmers in the central region. Cotton farming also experienced extremely rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s. [...] In 1970 only 46,900 hectares were sown with cotton, producing a volume of over 37,000 tons. By 1985, however, 385,900 hectares were covered with cotton, yielding almost 159,000 tons. [...] Those figures had dropped to 275,000 hectares and 84,000 tons during the drought of 1986. [...] Foreign-owned, large-scale, commercial production in the eastern border region was surpassing central region production in the late 1980s. Despite the advances in cotton production, cotton cultivation in the 1980s was still characterized by low yields and a low technological level. Even more so than soybeans, cotton suffered wide price fluctuations, and many small farmers who came to rely on cotton revenues in the 1970s became vulnerable to external price fluctuations in the following decade.

Most of the cotton ginning operations are performed by using double roller (DR) ginning machines which serve {{an important role in the}} cotton ginning industries. The rollers used in these industries are made of Chrome Composite Leather-Cladding (CCLC) covering fixed to a shaft.
