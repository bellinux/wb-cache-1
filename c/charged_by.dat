5|$|The {{presence}} of charge {{gives rise to}} an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> touching it with a glass rod that has itself been <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated {{in the late eighteenth}} century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.|$|E

5|$|As the 19th century progressed, the {{increasing}} need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports, but the handling charges and dues <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A {{solution was to}} build the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which {{was at the time}} the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began.|$|E

If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E
