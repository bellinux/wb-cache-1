40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the process of}} financial analysis {{within the context of}} Composite Information Systems (CIS) through an analysis of three cases. This was written in conjunction with the Composite Information Systems / Tool Kit (CIS/TK) research project at the MIT International Financial Services Research Center. A primary purpose of the paper was to identify, document, and understand the needs and problems of users of Composite Information Systems. The analysis makes use of the delineation between "physical connectivity " and "logical connectivity. " The first case study is from the academic domain. It is an event study of the potential differential effects of the October, 1988 stock market crash across a sample group of companies. The second case study involves Citicorp's North American Investment Bank (NAIB) and their attempt to integrate more than twenty different processing systems. Their task is made even more difficulty by {{the fact that there are}} not one but three main groups demanding this integration, each with a somewhat different goal. Finally, the third case study, also from Citicorp, involves the <b>Corporate</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Analyst</b> Department (CFAD) in the institutional bank. They make use of many different types of data and this paper investigates the problems that they face in integrating the data on both an inter- and an intra-database level. Each of the three case studies takes the following form: a description of the "problem, " an outline of the nature of the data involved, and documentation of the problems that one would face in integration. Finally, these problems are related back to the CIS/TK project...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the relationship between voluntary disclosure of intangibles and financial analysts’ earnings forecasts properties. Design/methodology/approach – Disclosures about intangible assets were hand-collected through content analysis of annual reports of a sample of U. S. non-financial firms, while analysts’ earnings forecasts properties were collected from Bloomberg Professional database. We relied on correlation and multivariate regression analyses to test our research hypotheses. Findings – The results show that increased intangible disclosures affect analysts’ earnings forecasts accuracy, dispersion, and favourable consensus recommendations. However, this effect varies according to the nature of intangible assets. Practical implications – Our results may be of interest to different market participants such as <b>corporate</b> managers, <b>financial</b> <b>analysts,</b> and standards setting bodies that recently published guidelines on voluntary disclosure of intangibles. Originality/value – This study develops a new comprehensive index to measure the content of narrative disclosures about a large number of intangibles, such as human, structural, and relational assets. Our findings contribute to the current debate on the value-relevance of narrative disclosures on intangibles to investors and <b>financial</b> <b>analysts.</b> Keywords Intangibles, disclosure, <b>financial</b> <b>analysts,</b> forecast error, forecast dispersion, consensus recommendation Paper type Research pape...|$|R
40|$|Although {{some studies}} are arguing that annual reports are less {{relevant}} or useful, other studies are providing evidence that annual reports {{are the most}} important source of <b>corporate</b> information for <b>financial</b> <b>analysts.</b> If it really seems to be true that all information in analyst reports is published in annual reports as well, the relevance and usefulness of analyst reports may be questioned. For this reason, our paper researches the extent to which analyst reports provide additional value to annual reports, and this with relation to non-financial information. Our results, based on a sample of 50 analyst reports made by Belgian <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> for 27 Belgian listed companies, show that <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> mainly use historical information about the company. We also provide evidence that analyst reports mention more non-financial information when firms are disclosing more non-financial information in their annual report.

40|$|The core {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to ascertain a link between the investment in fixed assets and the changing in the patterns of working capital. The relation between the flow of funds and the fixed assets is a central issue of the study. It is concluded in this study that funds from different sources determine the investment in fixed assets by different ways. With the help of this model, <b>corporate</b> planners and <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> can quantify the impacts of the flows of various funds on the assets holding patterns. Important conclusion of the model is that “fixed assets and working capital are complements. Working capital of a firm will increase with the enhancement in fixed assets”.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{contingency}} framework of e-readiness for corporate online reporting as a step towards establishing an e-readiness assessment methodology regarding corporate online reporting. This framework reflects the attempt to provide a theoretical background in the field. An extensive review of a number of instruments for assessing e-readiness as well as of other previously developed accounting frameworks was performed to identify the potential factors to be included in the proposed framework. Thirteen exploratory interviews and informal discussions were conducted with academics in the area of accounting and information technology and management information systems, and a pilot questionnaire survey was distributed to collect the perceptions of four different user-groups of <b>corporate</b> online reporting, (<b>financial</b> <b>analysts,</b> managers, bank credit officers and auditors) regarding the potential factors that should be included in the proposed framework. The contingency perspective was employed to integrate several internal and external factors in the form of the proposed framework.

40|$|External {{assessment}} of companies’ environmental aspects often {{focus on the}} existence of strategies, commitments, management systems and reporting of firms that concerns environmental aspects. Instead, in line with extra financial analysis, in order {{to play a role in}} decision-making, analysis of environmental aspects should incorporate the influence that stakeholders may have on future revenues of the assessed firm and how well advanced corporate strategies are in meeting these threats, turning them into business opportunities. Thereafter, the environmental information financial analysts’ use in their <b>financial</b> <b>analyst</b> reports as well as the relation between environmental and financial performance are illuminated. Three industry sectors, Chemicals, Electrical Equipment and Paper & Forest Products, are specially analysed in this report. Out of almost 4500 analyst reports about 36 percent contain environmental information, but when looking at industry sectors these numbers range from only 3 to up to 79 percent. The type of environmental information that the analysts focus on in their reports are on how firms’ products and product portfolios are adopted to Environmental regulations facing customers/markets, Customer demands and Eco-Efficiency. This product perspective is strongly related to discussions of business opportunities of the firm. In fact, a good 77 % of the <b>financial</b> <b>analyst</b> reports containing environmental information dealt with opportunities linked to environmental aspects. To a lower extent, <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> write about company specific risk issues like emissions and litigations while their reports is virtually absent from aspects like environmental strategies, policies, management systems, reporting and auditing. The correlation between <b>corporate</b> <b>financial</b> and environmental performances is illuminated through regression analyses. Industry environmental risk is found to be negatively correlated to corporate return on assets – ROA – (in an static model) while (when applying a dynamic model) corporate environmental performance and ROA have a positive correlation in the short term, which can find support by other studies using different data.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} role of trust {{in the relationship between}} the <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> and <b>corporate</b> managers in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) by focusing on two important aspects of the trust relationship. These aspects are key trustworthiness factors and the influential factors to perceive these key factors. <b>Financial</b> <b>analysts</b> use <b>financial</b> reports, which are prepared by corporate managers, in their analysis. In this thesis components of trust are distinguished from each other. These components are antecedent factors to trust, trust, and outcome of trust. Trust is considered as the <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> intention to depend on managers based on their perception of managers key characteristics including: integrity, benevolence, competence, and predictability. Antecedent factors to trust are psychological and sociological factors that influence the perception of <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> about those key characteristics. These antecedent factors include: related factors to: financial reports, management as well as external auditors, rules and regulations, and religion- Islam. The <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> trust in <b>corporate</b> mangers results in their reliance in the provided financial reports. The level of <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> reliance on the financial reports is positively associated with the level of their trust in managers. The theoretical model of trust developed by � is modified to apply in Iranian context. Purposive sampling is used to collect the required data. The primary data is gathered from in-depth interviews with 20 <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> in Iran. After that, the pattern coding technique proposed by Miles and Huberman (1994) is applied to summarise and analyse the interview data. The pattern matching technique is then used to compare the results of interviews to the theoretical patterns. The main findings of this research are: 1) trust is important in the relationship between the <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> and <b>corporate</b> mangers, 2) the degree of trust that the <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> put in the corporate managers is identified by the corporate managers level of trustworthiness, 3) the key factors of trustworthiness of a corporate manager are integrity, benevolence, competence, and predictability in his/her behaviour, 4) a model of trust relationship which explains how <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> build their relationships is suggested, 5) the main reason for <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> to build the relationship with corporate managers is to get accurate information about the company, especially inside information. This research contributes to the literature of trust which include: (i) adding trust as an important element in business relationship (ii) providing empirical evidence of the key factors of trustworthiness (iii) providing empirical evidence of the influential factors on the trust relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>analyst</b> and <b>corporate</b> managers (iv) proposing a new model of a trust relationship between the <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> and <b>corporate</b> managers. This research has several limitations that limit the findings to be generalised. These include: Firstly, in the selected sample, the relationship between the <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> and <b>corporate</b> managers was very specific. This is because: the Iranian financial market, the Iranian financial analysis industry, and the TSE all are in an early stage of development. Secondly, the required data were collected through conducting semi-structured interviews with <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> only. It was not possible therefore to directly monitor the actual relationship between <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> and <b>corporate</b> managers. As a result of this restriction, the researcher had to accept the statements made by <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> and the data analysis had to be limited to the results of these interviews. Thirdly, because the beliefs and attitudes of <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> had to be translated from Farsi into English in the process of translation some concepts may not have been conveyed correctly because of the linguistic differences. Fourthly, {{there is a lack of}} previous research in this area, especially in the Iranian financial market. The study also suggests some prospective areas for investigation by applying the research proposed mode in different business relationships such as the relationship between investors and corporate mangers and relationship between investors and <b>financial</b> <b>analysts.</b> The results of these suggested studies may be helpful to build a general model of trust which would be applied in different business relationships...|$|R

40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>analysts</b> are {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} users of corporate information.

However, previous researches documented differences in the accuracy of analysts' forecasts, attributable to numerous determinants.

Therefore, we elaborate the existing literature by examining the relationship between information use and forecast accuracy for a sample of Belgian <b>financial</b> <b>analysts.</b> More specifically, we concentrate on the use of non-financial information because this information is becoming more important relative to financial information in the evaluation of firms' performance. Our results demonstrate that the quantity of the non-financial information used by <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> is insignificantly related to forecast accuracy. So as <b>financial</b> <b>analysts</b> are using more corporate non-financial information, their forecast accuracy is not affected.
