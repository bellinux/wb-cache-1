40|$|A utilização da madeira de eucalipto na confecção de painéis MDF é recente, tornando-se necessário entender as modificações em sua estrutura anatômica durante as etapas do processo industrial, notadamente no desfibramento dos cavacos. Com esse objetivo, neste estudo foram aplicadas três condições diferenciadas de desfibramento dos cavacos, alterando-se (i) o tempo de aquecimento, (ii) as pressões de digestão e de desfibramento e (iii) a energia específica de desfibramento, sendo avaliadas as características anatômicas dos componentes celulares da madeira. O aumento da intensidade de refino dos cavacos de madeira reduziu o comprimento médio das fibras e aumentou o porcentual de fibras quebradas, corroborando as imagens de microscopia eletrônica de varredura, além da diminuição do número dos vasos e de células de parênquima. Essa condição de desfibramento mais intensa promoveu, também, um característico escurecimento da coloração da polpa composta pelos elementos celulares da madeira. A aplicação de variáveis de desfibramento mais brandas aumentou a presença de feixes de fibras e do número de vasos e de parênquima, resultando em uma polpa de coloração mais clara. As alterações das características morfológicas dos componentes celulares da madeira dos cavacos de eucalipto, após o tratamento de desfibramento, relacionaram-se com as etapas do processo operacional e com a qualidade tecnológica dos painéis de fibras MDF. The use of {{eucalyptus}} wood for production of MDF panels is recent, becoming {{necessary to understand}} {{the changes in the}} anatomical structure during the stages of industrial processing, especially during wood <b>chip</b> <b>refining.</b> With this aim, in the present work three different conditions of wood <b>chip</b> <b>refining</b> were applied (i) chip heating time, (ii) digestion and refining pressures and (iii) the specific refining energy, and the anatomical characteristics of wood cell components were evaluated.

This corroborated with the images of scanning electronic microscopy, besides decreasing the number of vessel elements and parenchyma cells. The more intense refining condition promoted a characteristic darkening of the pulp composed by the wood cell elements.

A given level of tensile index was reached over a wide range in specific energy input. The energy efficiency with respect to tensile index decreased if the pulp consistency in the blow line exceeded 55 %. The extended entropy model applied on the refiner showed that the calculated pulp consistency after the flat zone could be extremely high, leading to lower energy efficiency. This was not possible to detect by the measured values for the pulp consistency in the blow line.

40|$|When {{producing}} thermomechanical pulps (TMP), {{wood chips}} and fiber material are loaded mechanically in a disc-refiner {{to separate the}} fibers and to make them flexible. In the process, much of the energy supplied is transferred to the fiber material through cyclic compression, shear and friction processes. Therefore, compression and friction characteristics are {{needed in order to}} gain a better grasp of the forces acting during refining. To this end, in this thesis, the compressive and frictional behaviors of wood were investigated under simulated <b>chip</b> <b>refining</b> conditions (i. e., hot saturated steam, high strain rate compression, and high sliding speed). Two new, custom-designed, experimental setups were developed and used. The equipment used for compression testing was based on the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) technique and the friction tester was a pin-on-disc type of tribotester (wear rig). Both pieces of equipment allow a testing environment of hot saturated steam.   In the wood–steel friction investigation, the influence of the steam temperature (100 - 170 °C) was of primary interest. The wood species chosen for the friction tests were spruce (Picea abies), pine (Pinus sylvestris, Pinus radiata), and birch (Betula verrucosa). When performing measurements in the lower-temperature region (100 - 130 °C), the friction coefficients registered for the softwoods were generally low and surface properties such as lubrica­tion were suggested to have a great influence on the results; however, in the higher-tempera­ture region (~ 130 - 170 °C), the friction coefficients of all investigated wood species were probably determined by bulk properties to a much greater extent. When most of the wood extractives had been removed from the specimens, testing results revealed distinct peaks in friction at similar temperatures, as the internal friction of the different wood species are known to have their maxima at ~ 110 – 130 °C. One suggested explanation of these friction peaks is that reduced lubrication enabled energy to dissipate into the bulk material, causing particularly high friction at the temperature at which internal damping of the material was greatest. During the friction measurements in the higher-temperature region, the specimens of the different wood species also started to lose fibers (i. e., produce wear debris) at different characteristic temperatures, as indicated by peaks in the coefficient of friction. In refining, the generally lower shives content of pine TMP than of spruce TMP could partly be explained by a lower wear initiation temperature in the pine species.   Wood stiffness is known to decrease with temperature, when measured at low strain rates. The results presented in this thesis can confirm a similar behavior for high strain rate compression. The compressive strain registered during impulsive loading (using a modified split Hopkinson equipment) increased with temperature; because strain rate also increased with temperature. Accordingly, the strain rates should determine the strain magnitudes also in a refiner, since the impulsive loads in a refiner are of similar type. Larger strains would thus be achieved when refining at high temperatures. The results achieved in the compression tests were also considered in relation to refining parameters such as plate clearance and refining intensity, parameters that could be discussed in light of the stress–strain relations derived from the high strain rate measurements. Trials recorded using high-speed photography demonstrated that the wood relaxation was very small in the investigated time frame ~ 6 ms. As well, in TMP refining the wood material has little time to relax, i. e., ~ 0. 04 – 0. 5 ms in a large single disc refiner. The results presented here are therefore more suitable for comparison with the impulsive loads arising in a refiner than are the results of any earlier study. It can therefore be concluded that the modified SHPB testing technique combined with high-speed photography is well suited for studying the dynamic behavior of wood under conditions like those prevalent in a TMP system...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the novel wood <b>chip</b> <b>refining</b> process called AdvancedThermomechanical Pulp (ATMP) refining. ATMP {{consists}} of mechanical pretreatmentof chips in Impressafiner and Fiberizer prior to first stage refining atincreased intensity. Process chemicals (this study was concentrated on hydrogenperoxide and magnesium hydroxide) are introduced into the first stage refiner. It is known that the use of chemicals in TMP process and first stage refining atelevated intensity can reduce the energy demands of refining. The downside is thatthey also alter the character of the produced pulp. Reductions in fibre length andtear index are usually the consequences of refining at elevated intensity. Additionof chemicals usually leads to reduction of the light scattering coefficient. Usingstatistical methods it was shown {{that it is possible to}} maintain the TMP character ofthe pulp using the ATMP process. This is explained by a separation of thedefibration and the fibre development phases in refining. This separation allowsdefibration of chips to fibres and fibre bundles without addition of chemicals orincrease in refining intensity. Chemicals are applied in the fibre developmentphase only (first stage refiner). The energy demand in refining to reach tensileindex of 25 Nm/g was reduced by up to 1. 1 MWh/odt (42 %) using the ATMPprocess on Loblolly pine. The energy demand in refining of White spruce, requiredto reach tensile index of 30 Nm/g, was reduced by 0. 65 MWh/odt (37 %). Characterizations of individual fibre properties, properties of sheets made fromlong fibre fractions and model fibre sheets with different fines fractions werecarried out. It was established that both the process equipment configuration (i. e. the mechanical pre‐treatment and the elevated refining intensity) and the additionof process chemicals in the ATMP process influence fibre properties such as external and internal fibrillation as well as the amount of split fibres. Improvementof these properties translated into improved properties of sheets, made from thelong fibre fractions of the studied pulps. The quality of the fines fraction alsoimproved. However, the mechanisms of improvement in the fines quality seem tobe different for fines, generated using improved process configuration andaddition of process chemicals. The first type of fines contributed to better bondingof model long fibre sheets through the densification of the structure. Fines whichhave been influenced by the addition of the process chemicals seemed in additionto improve bonding between long fibres by enhancing the specific bond strength. The improved fibre and fines properties also translated into better airpermeability and surface roughness of paper sheets, properties which areespecially important for supercalendered (SC) printing paper. The magnitude offibre roughening after moistening was mainly influenced by the processequipment configuration while the addition of process chemicals yielded lowestfinal surface roughness due to the lowest initial surface roughness. There was nodifference in how fines fractions from the studied processes influenced the fibreroughening. However, fines with better bonding yielded model fibre sheets withhigher PPS, probably due to their consolidation around fibre joints. Hence, thedecrease in PPS can probably be attributed to the improvements in the long fibrefraction properties while the improvement of fines quality contributed to thereduction of air permeability. The process chemicals, utilized in the ATMP process (Mg(OH) 2 and H 2 O 2) alsoproved to be an effective bleaching system. Comparable increases in brightnesscould be reached using the ATMP process and conventional tower bleaching. Maximum brightness of the pulp was reached after approximately 10 minutes ofhigh‐consistency storage after refining or 40 minutes of conventional bleaching. This study was conducted using a pilot scale refiner system operated as a batchprocess. Most of the experiments were performed using White spruce (Piceaglauca). In Paper I, Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) was used. It is believed that theresults presented in this thesis are valid for other softwood raw materials as well,but this limitation should be considered...|$|E

MDF panels obtained in critical refining condition showed darker fibers and cell walls transversely broken and lower resistance to internal bond, surface soundness, withdrawal of screws and swelling in thickness.

At an acidic pH, the ratios of CMCase and avicelase activity to cellulase activity defined by filter paper unit were high, but at a neutral pH, the β-glucosidase ratio was high.

40|$|Maternal {{nutrition}} {{can have}} a profound effect on fetal growth, development, and subsequent infant birth weight. Preconception dietary patterns have not been assessed in relation to perinatal outcomes. The objectives of this study were to identify associations between maternal dietary patterns in the 12 mo before conception on fetal growth and preterm delivery. Preconception food frequency data were collected retrospectively in 309 women. Dietary patterns were derived using factor analysis. Perinatal outcomes were collected at delivery with birth weight data calculated into percentiles to assess small and large for gestational age and preterm delivery at < 37 wk. Three dietary patterns were identified: 1) high-protein/fruit (characterized by fish, meat, chicken, fruit, and some whole grains); 2) high-fat/sugar/ takeaway (takeaway foods, potato <b>chips,</b> <b>refined</b> grains); and 3) vegetarian-type (vegetables, legumes, whole grains). A 1 -SD increase in the scores on the high-protein/fruit pattern was associated with decreased likelihood of preterm birth (adjusted OR: 0. 31; 95 % CI: 0. 13, 0. 72; P = 0. 007), whereas the reverse direction was apparent for the high-fat/sugar/takeaway pattern (adjusted OR: 1. 54; 95 % CI: 1. 10, 2. 15; P = 0. 011). A 1 -SD increase in the scores on the high fat/sugar/takeaway pattern was also associated with shorter gestation (adjusted regression coefficient: 22. 7; 95 % CI: 24. 3, 21. 1; P = 0. 001) and birth length (adjusted regression coefficient: 20. 5; 95 % CI: 20. 8, 20. 1; P = 0. 004). Nutrition before pregnancy is associated with perinatal outcomes. A dietary pattern containing several protein-rich food sources, fruit, and some whole grains is associated with reduced likelihood for preterm delivery, whereas a dietary pattern mainly consisting of discretionary items is associated with preterm delivery, shorter birth length, and earlier gestation. Poor dietary behaviors in the periconceptional period could be altered to promote behavior change in dietary intake to improve perinatal outcomes and the long-term health of the child. J.

In order to optimize this process, a rapid and reliable method was needed to predict energy savings. In this paper, we examine a fiber staining method that {{involves the use of}} Simons stain. This stain for microscopic examination of pulp fibers has been used previously to evaluate the degree of fibrillation in beaten fibers or more recently to differentiate fibers from untreated (control) and fungus-treated wood chips. Aspen or loblolly pine wood chips were treated with white-rot fungi under different experimental conditions in static-bed bioreactors for two or four weeks.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to improve the understanding of some aspects on wood and fibre mechanics related to conditions in the thermomechanical pulping process. Another objective was to measure the power distribution between the rotating plates in a refiner.   The thesis comprises the following parts: –A literature review aimed at describing fracture in wood and fibres as related to the thermomechanical pulping process –An experimental study of fracture in wood under compression, at conditions {{similar to those in}} feeding of chips into preheaters and chip refiners –An experimental study of the effect of impact velocity on the fracture of wood, related to conditions of fibre separation in the breaker bar zone in a <b>chip</b> <b>refiner</b> –A micromechanical model of the deterioration of wood fibres, related to the development of fibre properties during the intense treatment in the small gap in the refining zone –Measurements of the power distribution in a refiner.   The fracture in wood under compression was investigated by use of acoustic emission monitoring. The wood was compressed in both lateral and longitudinal directions to predict preferred modes of deformation in order to achieve desired irreversible changes in the wood structure. It was concluded that the most efficient compression direction in this respect is longitudinal. Preferable temperature at which the compression should be carried out and specific energy input needed in order to achieve substantial changes in the wood structure were also given.   The fibre separation step and specifically the effect of impact velocity on the fracture energy were studied by use of a falling weight impact tester. The fracture surfaces were also examined under a microscope. An increase in impact velocity resulted in an increase in fracture energy. In the thermomechanical pulping process the fibres are subjected to lateral compression, tension and shear which causes the creation of microcracks in the fibre wall. This damage reduces the fibre wall stiffness. A simplified analytical model is presented for the prediction of the stiffness degradation due to the damage state in a wood fibre, loaded in uni-axial tension or shear. The model was based on an assumed displacement field together with the minimum total potential energy theorem. For the damage development an energy criterion was employed. The model was applied to calculate the relevant stiffness coefficients {{as a function of the}} damage state. The energy consumption in order to achieve a certain damage state in a softwood fibre by uniaxial tension or shear load was also calculated. The energy consumption was found to be dependent on the microfibril angle in the middle secondary wall, the loading case, the thicknesses of the fibre cell wall layers, and conditions such as moisture content and temperature. At conditions, prevailing at the entrance of the gap between the plates in a refiner and at relative high damage states, more energy was needed to create cracks at higher microfibril angles. The energy consumption was lower for earlywood compared to latewood fibres. For low microfibril angles, the energy consumption was lower for loading in shear compared to tension for both earlywood and latewood fibres. Material parameters, such as initial damage state and specific fracture energy, were determined by fitting of input parameters to experimental data. Only a part of the electrical energy demand in the thermomechanical pulping process is considered to be effective in fibre separation and developing fibre properties. Therefore it is important to improve the understanding of how this energy is distributed along the refining zone. Investigations have been carried out in a laboratory single-disc refiner. It was found that a new developed force sensor is an effective way of measuring the power distribution within the refining zone. The collected data show that the tangential force per area and consequently also the power per unit area increased with radial position. The results in this thesis improve the understanding of the influence of some process parameters in thermomechanical pulping related wood and fibre mechanics such as loading rate, loading direction, moisture content and temperature to separate the fibres from the wood and to achieve desired irreversible changes in the fibre structure. Further, the thesis gives an insight of the spatial energy distribution in a refiner during thermomechanical pulping. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The Affymetrix GeneChip {{technology}} uses multiple probes per gene {{to measure}} its expression level. Individual probe signals can vary widely, which hampers proper interpretation. This variation {{can be caused}} by probes that do not properly match their target gene or that match multiple genes. To determine the accuracy of Affymetrix arrays, we developed an extensive verification protocol, for mouse arrays incorporating the NCBI RefSeq, NCBI UniGene Unique, NIA Mouse Gene Index, and UCSC mouse genome databases. Results Applying this protocol to Affymetrix Mouse Genome arrays (the earlier U 74 Av 2 and the newer 430 2. 0 array), the number of sequence-verified probes with perfect matches was no less than 85 % and 95 %, respectively; and for 74 % and 85 % of the probe sets all probes were sequence verified. The latter percentages increased to 80 % and 94 % after discarding one or two unverifiable probes per probe set, and even further to 84 % and 97 % when, in addition, allowing for one or two mismatches between probe and target gene. Similar results were obtained for other mouse arrays, as well as for human and rat arrays. Based on these data, <b>refined</b> <b>chip</b> definition files for all arrays are provided online.

40|$|A pilot {{refining}} {{trial on}} Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) was conducted using a novel process configuration called ATMP (Advanced Thermomechanical Pulp). In this process, selective wood disintegration due to mechanical pre-treatment of <b>chips</b> and increased <b>refining</b> intensity {{is combined with}} targeted application of chemicals after defibration. Standard TMP was compared to ATMP where different chemical strategies were applied. These strategies employed active chemicals known to cause sulphonation, carboxylation/oxidation and degradation of fibre components in order to assist the refining process. Main goal {{of the study was}} to evaluate the potential of decreasing the energy demand in refining evaluated at equal tensile index compared to a TMP reference. Another goal was to produce pulp where the TMP character, i. e. good optical properties combined with good bulk and strength properties, was fully preserved. The objective was also to study other quality aspects of the pulp produced using the ATMP process and compare these to properties of conventional TMP. Energy demand in refining was decreased with at least 0. 6 MWh/odt compared to TMP at tensile index 25 Nm/g when ATMP concept was used. Maximum achieved reduction in the refining energy demand was 1. 1 MWh/odt (42 %) compared to the TMP reference at tensile index 25 Nm/g. Statistical analysis showed that pulp, produced using the ATMP process, retained all its important properties such as light scattering, density and elongation on the same level as control TMP, i. e. it had the same character. All pulps produced using the ATMP process had very low shive content. Treatment with hydrogen peroxide and magnesium hydroxide was the most successful chemical strategy tested during the pilot trial.

40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out reliable laboratory methods to predict the effect of enzymes on specific energy consumption and fiber properties of TMP pulp. The second one was to find with interactive software called “Knowledge discovery in databases” enzymes or other additives that can be used in finding a solution to reduce energy consumption of TMP pulp. The chemical composition of wood and enzymes, which have activity on main wood components were presented in the literature part of the work. The results of previous research in energy reduction of TMP process with enzymes were also highlighted. The main principles of knowledge discovery have been included in literature part too. The experimental part of the work contains the methods description in which the standard size chip, crushed chip and fiberized spruce chip (fiberized pulp) were used. Different types of enzymatic treatment with different dosages and time were tested during the experiments and showed. Pectinase, endoglucanase and mixture of enzymes were used for evaluation of method reliability. The fines content and fiber length of pulp was measured and used as evidence of enzymes' effect. The refining method with “Bauer” laboratory disc refiner was evaluated as not highly reliable. It was not able to provide high repeatability of results, because of uncontrolled feeding capacity and refining consistency. The refining method with Valley refiner did not have a lot of variables and showed stable and repeatable results in energy saving. The results of experiments showed that efficient enzymes impregnation is probably the main target with enzymes application for energy saving. During the work the fiberized pulp showed high accessibility to enzymatic treatment and liquid penetration without special impregnating equipment. The reason was that fiberized pulp has larger wood surface area and thereby the contact area between the enzymatic solution and wood is also larger. Standard size chip and crushed chip treatment without special impregnator of enzymatic solution was evaluated as not efficient and did not show visible, repeatable results in energy consumption decrease. Thereby it was concluded that using of fiberized pulp and Valley refiner for measurements of enzymes' effectiveness in SEC decrease is more suitable than normal size chip and crushed <b>chip</b> with “Bauer” <b>refiner.</b> Endoglucanase with 5 kg/t dosage showed about 20 % energy consumption decrease. Mixture of enzymes with 1. 5 kg/t dosage showed about 15 % decrease of energy consumption during the refining.
