5|$|In Hastings's view, Lang was {{probably}} {{more sympathetic to}} Rome than any other Church of England archbishop of modern times, responsible for a discreet catholicisation of the Church of England's practices. A small outward indication of this was his decision to use a <b>cassock</b> as everyday dress and to wear a mitre on formal occasions, the first archbishop since the English Reformation to do so. Lang believed that {{in relation to the}} supreme truths of the church, rituals and dress were of small account, but that if people's worship was assisted by such customs they should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Andrei and Foma have a {{conversation}} about Foma’s faults, especially lying. Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his <b>cassock</b> is tacky, and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. We cut to banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how {{he can be a}} painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E
25|$|For seminarians, deacons, {{and priests}} the <b>cassock</b> {{is exactly the}} same as their normal cassock: a black <b>cassock</b> with black buttons, girded with a black fascia.|$|E
50|$|As is the {{practice}} in the Anglican churches, <b>cassocks</b> may be worn by others who are not ministers. Ordained elders and deacons, as they serve as worship leaders, readers, and administer communion may also wear <b>cassocks</b> {{which tend to be}} black. Those worn by choirs and other worship leaders are usually coloured (for instance, The Shadyside Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) choir is dressed in red <b>cassocks</b> under white surplices).|$|R
50|$|Eastern Catholic {{cardinals}} {{continue to}} wear the normal dress appropriate to their liturgical tradition, though some may line their <b>cassocks</b> with scarlet and wear scarlet fascias, or in some cases, wear Eastern-style <b>cassocks</b> entirely of scarlet.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cassocks</b> are {{sometimes}} also worn by readers, altar servers and choir members, {{when they do}} this is the double breasted style. Readers and altar servers usually wear black <b>cassocks,</b> but those worn by choirs are usually coloured.|$|R

25|$|Today, most Jesuits in the United States {{wear the}} {{clerical}} collar and black clothing of ordinary priests, although some still wear the black <b>cassock.</b> Jesuits in tropical countries may use a white <b>cassock</b> when ministering outdoors.|$|E
25|$|Honorary Prelates use a red-trimmed black <b>cassock</b> {{with purple}} sash for all occasions. The red {{is the same}} shade as that used by bishops. They may use a purple <b>cassock</b> as their choir dress for liturgical events of special solemnity.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s the choir <b>cassocks</b> {{are of a}} deep {{burgundy}} colour, matching the stencil design hue on the organ pipes. Originally the choir wore traditional black <b>cassocks</b> and white surplices, but {{with the introduction of}} An Australian Prayer Book in the late 1970s, new <b>cassocks</b> of a green colour approximating that of the new prayer book cover (and coincidentally, that of the visible organ pipework at the time) were introduced and surplices were discontinued. On a visit to the cathedral in 1985 by the then Archbishop of Canterbury, a somewhat astonished Robert Runcie exclaimed that he had [...] "never seen a cathedral choir wearing green robes before". With the restoration of the organ in the early 1990s, surplices were restored and <b>cassocks</b> of a deep burgundy were introduced matching the new stencil design hue on the organ pipes.|$|R
5000|$|They {{were called}} [...] "Black Canons" [...] because they wore Black <b>Cassocks,</b> Black Capes and Hoods.|$|R
25|$|The most {{immediately}} noticeable {{feature is}} a white <b>cassock</b> and zucchetto (skull cap). Only the Pope is permitted to wear a <b>cassock</b> made out of watered silk. The <b>cassock</b> {{used to have a}} train on it, but Pope Pius XII discontinued this custom. For convenience, the train could be folded up and fastened {{to the back of the}} <b>cassock.</b> He used to wear a tufted fascia (white sash-like belt fastened about the waist, the ends of which fall down past the knees and are often embroidered with the Pope's coat of arms), until Paul VI replaced it with a simpler fringed sash. Previously, the tufted fascia (terminating in gold tassels) was worn with choir dress, and the fringed fascia (terminating in a simpler gold fringe) was worn with ordinary dress.|$|E
25|$|While ordained and instituted ministers must wear an alb (with {{cincture}} and amice {{unless the}} form of the alb makes these unnecessary), albs or any other appropriate attire, such as a <b>cassock</b> and surplice, may be worn by servers. Black and red are the most common colors for a server's <b>cassock,</b> if used.|$|E
25|$|Priests {{who hold}} {{additional}} honors may wear a different cassock: Chaplains of His Holiness wear a black <b>cassock</b> with purple piping, buttons, and fascia, while Honorary Prelates and Protonotaries apostolic wear a purple <b>cassock</b> with scarlet piping and buttons with a purple fascia. A black <b>cassock</b> with amaranth piping and buttons, girded with a purple fascia, serves as pian dress (academic dress) for an honorary prelate or protonotary apostolic. Canons may wear the rochet (if the chapter has been granted usus rochetti by papal indult) with a distinctive mozzetta, the particular colors {{of which are}} determined by the chapter.|$|E
50|$|Black is {{the most}} common colour for priests, readers, virgers and server <b>cassocks.</b> Lighter colours, such as white are used in {{tropical}} countries and some cathedrals have colours specific for their location. Piping is also used in the Anglican church to indicate position held with red being used for Deans, Archdeacons and Cathedral Canons. Bishops and Archbishops often wear purple <b>cassocks.</b> This has been practise since the 19th century. More recently the Archbishops have chosen to wear black, this {{can be seen in the}} ministries of Rowan Williams and Justin Welby. Scarlet <b>cassocks</b> are properly worn only by Chaplains to the Queen and by members of Royal foundations such as Westminster Abbey and some Cambridge college chapels.|$|R

25|$|Bishops {{wear the}} {{above-mentioned}} purple <b>cassock</b> with scarlet piping, {{and add a}} pectoral cross suspended from a green and gold cord, a mozzetta over the rochet, and a purple zucchetto under the biretta. A cardinal wears a scarlet <b>cassock</b> with scarlet trim, pectoral cross on a red and gold cord and a red mozzetta over the rochet, with a red zucchetto. The Pope's choir dress includes a white <b>cassock,</b> rochet, red silk mozetta, red brocade stole and his pectoral cross hangs from a golden cord. Some canons wear their cross on a ribbon, but only a bishop may wear the cross on a cord. Under new regulations, neither bishops nor canons wear fur trimmed cappas.|$|E

25|$|The cope, therefore, {{is often}} worn at Anglo-Catholic churches where the celebrant at the Eucharist would {{conventionally}} wear the chasuble. In general those clergy who robe wear a <b>cassock,</b> surplice, scarf and, occasionally, also an academic hood. Since about 1990 there {{has sometimes been}} a practice of wearing a long surplice without a <b>cassock,</b> particularly through the summer. Most clergy in the diocese, however, dispense even with these robes, conducting church services in street clothes ranging from {{a suit and tie}} or clerical collar, to smart casual attire.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinctive}} {{habit of}} the canon regular is the rochet, worn over a <b>cassock</b> or tunic, which {{is indicative of}} their clerical origins. This has evolved in various ways among different congregations, from wearing the full rochet to the wearing of a white tunic and scapular. The Austrian congregation, as an example, wears a sarozium, a narrow band of white cloth—a vestige of the scapular—which hangs down both front and back over a <b>cassock</b> for their weekday wear. For more solemn occasions, they wear the rochet under a violet mozzetta.|$|E

25|$|Anglican bishops usually wear {{a purple}} <b>cassock.</b> Over this, {{instead of the}} surplice, they wear the rochet with red or black chimere and {{matching}} cuffs, black tippet, and sometimes an academic hood.|$|E
25|$|Supernumerary Protonotaries Apostolic {{dress the}} same as Honorary Prelates. As an {{additional}} privilege, they {{have the option of}} also using a purple ferraiuolo, a silk cape worn with the red-trimmed black <b>cassock</b> for non-liturgical events of special solemnity (for instance, graduations and commencements).|$|E
25|$|Historically, Anglican clergy have {{vested in}} <b>cassock,</b> {{surplice}} and tippet for Morning and Evening Prayer, while bishops wear the rochet and chimere. In some monastic communities and Anglo-Catholic parishes, the officiant wears surplice or alb, stole and cope when Evensong is celebrated solemnly.|$|E
