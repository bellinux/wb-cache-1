5|$|Planning for {{the lake}} began in 1987. The main {{goal was to}} meet Southern California seasonal, drought and {{emergency}} needs. MWD chose the current site because of its geographic location, and began construction planning in 1993. Construction of the lake in 1995 with construction of the three dams. With over 40 million cubic yards of foundation excavation and 110 million cubic yards of embankment construction, {{the construction of the}} dams was the largest earthworks project in the United States. The shovels, loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available and established a new standard for earth and rock movement. The two rock processing plants established for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single <b>commercial</b> <b>processing</b> operation in California. Construction of the lake was the largest construction project by the MWD since building the Colorado River Aqueduct.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of the {{recreational}} blue crab fishery in the Gulf of Mexico is not well known. Commercial crabbing was first reported in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1880s. Early crab fishermen used long-handled dip nets and drop nets among other simple fishing gear types to trap crabs at night. Blue crab spoiled quickly, which limited distribution and hindered {{the growth of the}} fishery for several decades. The first <b>commercial</b> <b>processing</b> plant in Louisiana opened in Morgan City in 1924. Other plants opened soon after, although <b>commercial</b> <b>processing</b> of hard blue crabs was not widespread until World War II.|$|E
500|$|Another trait {{unique to}} {{domestic}} sheep {{as compared to}} wild ovines is their wide variation in color. Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald. Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly. However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks. While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning. The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike. There is variation of wool type and quality even {{among members of the}} same flock, so wool classing {{is a step in the}} <b>commercial</b> <b>processing</b> of the fibre.Depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights. Their rate of growth and mature weight is a heritable trait that is often selected for in breeding. Ewes typically weigh between , and rams between [...] When all deciduous teeth have erupted, the sheep has 20 teeth. Mature sheep have 32 teeth. As with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw. These are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed. There are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight incisors, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped canines. This means that the dental formula for sheep is either [...] or [...] There is a large diastema between the incisors and the molars.|$|E

2500|$|Mad honey {{intoxication}} is {{a result}} of eating honey containing grayanotoxins. Honey produced from flowers of rhododendrons, mountain laurels, sheep laurel, and azaleas may cause honey intoxication. Symptoms include dizziness, weakness, excessive perspiration, nausea, and vomiting. Less commonly, low blood pressure, shock, heart rhythm irregularities, and convulsions may occur, with rare cases resulting in death. Honey intoxication is more likely when using [...] "natural" [...] unprocessed honey and honey from farmers who may have a small number of hives. <b>Commercial</b> <b>processing,</b> with pooling of honey from numerous sources, is thought to dilute any toxins.|$|E
