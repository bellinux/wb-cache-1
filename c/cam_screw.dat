2500|$|... 750 cc and 500 cc {{versions}} of the Revolution engine are used in Harley-Davidson's Street line of light cruisers. These motors, named the Revolution X, use a single overhead <b>cam,</b> <b>screw</b> and locknut valve adjustment, a single internal counterbalancer, and vertically split crankcases; all of these changes making it different from the original Revolution design.|$|E
5000|$|A mafer {{is a tool}} used in filmmaking {{to secure}} lights or rigging. <b>Cam</b> <b>screw</b> tightening, {{mounting}} attachments include: baby stud or flex arm. In addition to this, mafers have a padded grip surface which combine one flat jaw and a v-notched jaw.|$|E

50|$|A {{special case}} of this cam is {{constant}} lead, where {{the position of the}} follower is linear with rotation, as in a lead screw. The purpose and detail of implementation influence whether this application is called a <b>cam</b> or a <b>screw</b> thread, but in some cases, the nomenclature may be ambiguous.|$|R
50|$|Drum brakes {{are also}} {{occasionally}} fitted as the parking (and emergency) brake {{even when the}} rear wheels use disc brakes as the main brakes. Many rear disc braking systems use a parking brake in which the piston in the caliper is actuated by a <b>cam</b> or <b>screw.</b> This compresses the pads against the rotor. However, this type of system becomes much more complicated when the rear disc brakes use fixed, multi-piston calipers. In this situation, a small drum is usually fitted within {{or as part of}} the brake disc. This type of brake is also known as a banksia brake.|$|R
5000|$|The gauge {{consists}} of a beam, a headstock, and a scribing or marking implement, typically a pin, knife, pen or wheel. The headstock slides along the beam, and is locked in place by various means: a locking <b>screw,</b> <b>cam</b> lever, or a wedge. The marking implement is fixed to {{one end of the}} beam.|$|R
50|$|Slip joints can be {{designed}} to allow continuous relative motion of two components or it can allow an adjustment from one temporarily fixed position to another. Examples of the latter are tripods, hiking poles, or similar telescoping device. The position is fixed using a clamping mechanism based on a <b>cam,</b> a set <b>screw</b> or similar locking mechanism. Slip joints can also be non-telescoping, such as the joints on some older wooden surveyor's levelling rods. These use a joint that keeps the sections offset from each other but able to be slid together for transport.|$|R
50|$|Episode 2 - Days 4-6 (September 21) - The {{whole team}} (except Geoff) starts the episode by visiting a {{transfer}} station (Commissioners Street Transfer Station in Toronto's Port Lands) to raid the unwanted junk from visitors there, where they score an old dishwasher, a working microwave, and some stainless steel. A separate trip by Gordie and Cam {{leads them to}} a construction site, where they harvest their used lumber and weeping tile. However, a shortage of fasteners and drywall (being unable to find only scrap pieces and no full sheets) leads Geoff to spend $1000 on new drywall and <b>screws</b> (<b>Cam</b> agrees, as he believes that they would save on plaster compared to drywalling with their scrap pieces). Meanwhile, Michelle believes that she is being silenced in terms of design after Geoff has Gordie and Anthony design decorations made from freecycled materials behind her back (Gordie with a lamp and Anthony with a wine rack) while she and Ross go shopping, but her attitude changes for the better after the junk hotline leads Michelle, Gordie, and Jean-Marc to St. Luke's United Church, where they recover solid oak from old church pews, a large mirror, lockers, and an old desk that they intend to repurpose as their bathroom vanity. For the bathroom tiles, Anthony and Ross grab tiles from a warehouse where Anthony has previously freecycled for tile, but due to miscommunication with Michelle (who had insisted on going with them but was held back by Geoff), they return with more than twice what they need, forcing the team to give away the excess. In the end, Ron has some reservation as to the progress, and the accumulating pile of garbage at the worksite is leading him {{to believe that the}} site is being disrespected.|$|R
