5|$|When {{considering}} the project, Charles Cecil {{played the game}} again and noticed many issues, including pixilated backgrounds, FMV and audio were of poor quality, and he also felt some dialogue was out of place. He thought all these elements could be addressed and improved in a remastered edition, in which they <b>could</b> <b>add</b> a diary, hint system, and new artwork from Dave Gibbons, which they could offer as an interactive digital comic.|$|E
5|$|When the live-action of the manga was made, Watsuki {{had several}} ideas about Kenshin's mind about his early {{appearances}} in the series. This resulted in the manga reboot Rurouni Kenshin: Restoration where Kenshin's characterization was expanded by the author who thought in retrospective about what he <b>could</b> <b>add</b> to him. Although there were some changes to the cast, Watsuki {{wanted them to be}} subtle such as Kenshin wearing a scarf. He also wrote a prequel chapter to the original series which helped the readers to understand why Kenshin would stay in Kaoru's dojo.|$|E
5|$|Blaise Pascal {{invented the}} {{mechanical}} calculator in 1642; {{it was the}} first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, digital computer. Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it <b>could</b> <b>add.</b> To subtract, the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E
5000|$|Energy recuperation, {{storage and}} power assist <b>could</b> be <b>added.</b>|$|R

5|$|Chrysler {{realized}} that his tower's height would exceed the Empire State Building's as well, having ordered Van Alen to change the Chrysler's original roof from a stubby Romanesque dome to the narrow steel spire. However, the Empire State's developer John J. Raskob reviewed the plans and {{realized that}} he <b>could</b> <b>add</b> five more floors and a spire of his own to his 80-story building, and subsequently acquired the nearby plots needed to support that building's height extension. Two days later, the Empire State Building's co-developer, former Governor Al Smith, announced the updated plans for that skyscraper, with an observation deck on the 86th-floor roof at a height of , higher than the Chrysler's 71st-floor observation deck.|$|E
5|$|The stadium was {{designed}} to be capable of supporting future seating expansion to 80,000. The 30,000 seats would be added above the second deck of the stadium {{from the end of the}} press boxes across to the northwest end of the venue, wrapping around the remainder of the horseshoe. The auxiliary video display currently adjacent to the easternmost section of the media areas would likely be relocated to atop the new third deck. The University of Minnesota <b>could</b> <b>add</b> all 30,000 seats in a single addition or in increments of 10,000 seats, meeting demand as it is needed (although the duplicated costs of such a plan make it unlikely). If expansion is ever undertaken, it can be completed in about 9 months so that there would be minimal interruption of a football season.|$|E
5|$|When {{considering}} the project, Cecil {{played the game}} again and noticed many issues, including that backgrounds were pixilated, the movies and audio were of poor quality, and he also felt some dialogue was out of place. He thought all these elements could be addressed and improved in a remastered edition, in which they <b>could</b> <b>add</b> a diary, hint system, and new artwork from Dave Gibbons, which they could offer as an interactive digital comic. On December 9, 2010, Revolution Software announced the release of Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror – Remastered on Apple iOS devices, and was finally released on December 16, 2010. The new features include an exclusive interactive digital comic from Dave Gibbons, fully animated facial expressions, enhanced graphics, high quality music, a context-sensitive hint system, diary, and a Dropbox integration which facilitates a unique cross-platform save-game feature, enabling players to enjoy the same adventure simultaneously on multiple devices. It also featured full Game Center integration – including in-game achievements. The Mac and PC versions followed in early 2011.|$|E

5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep, now {{formally}} established as id Software, {{used some of}} these to prototype ideas for their own games. Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with 3D computer graphics, which until then was largely the purview of flight simulation games such as Wing Commander (1990). Carmack found that this was {{largely due to the}} limitations of personal computers of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast action game in 3D due to the number of surfaces it needed to calculate. During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through ray casting, in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D game engine that used animated 2D sprites for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game Hovertank 3D, in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters. In the fall of 1991, after the team—sans Wilbur—had relocated to Madison, Wisconsin, and he had largely finished the engine work for Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy, Carmack learned about , a role-playing game in development by Blue Sky Productions. Ultima Underworld was planned to display texture-mapped 3D graphics without Hovertanks restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting. Deciding that he <b>could</b> <b>add</b> texture mapping without sacrificing the engine's speed or greatly increasing the system requirements as Underworld was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from Hovertank 3D for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 Catacomb 3-D. Upon seeing it, Scott Miller of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.|$|E

25|$|Bruce Ableson {{launched}} Open Diary in October 1998, which soon grew {{to thousands}} of online diaries. Open Diary innovated the reader comment, becoming the first blog community where readers <b>could</b> <b>add</b> comments to other writers' blog entries.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{high-speed}} calculations, ENIAC {{could solve}} {{problems that were}} previously unsolvable. It was roughly a thousand {{times faster than the}} existing technology. It <b>could</b> <b>add</b> 5,000 numbers or do 357 10-digit multiplications in one second.|$|E
25|$|And if my sensations <b>could</b> <b>add</b> {{anything}} to the general suffrage, I might relate that I was many years ago so shocked by Cordelia's death that I know not whether I ever endured to read again the last scenes of the play till I undertook to revise them as an editor.|$|E

25|$|The Europa Clipper {{would take}} {{about three years}} to image 95% of the surface of Europa at about 50 meters per pixel. With this data, {{scientists}} could then find a suitable landing site. By one estimate, including a lander <b>could</b> <b>add</b> as much as $1 billion to the mission's cost.|$|E
25|$|Companies like Friden, Marchant Calculator and Monroe made desktop {{mechanical}} calculators {{from the}} 1930s that <b>could</b> <b>add,</b> subtract, multiply and divide. In 1948, the Curta {{was introduced by}} Austrian inventor Curt Herzstark. It was a small, hand-cranked mechanical calculator and as such, a descendant of Gottfried Leibniz's Stepped Reckoner and Thomas's Arithmometer.|$|E
25|$|Observers {{as well as}} pilots {{could become}} aces. Victories could be shared, and counted as an {{addition}} of one to the score of each 'victor' rather than being divided fractionally. In some cases, a single destroyed German or Austro-Hungarian aircraft <b>could</b> <b>add</b> to the scores {{of half a dozen}} or more French fliers.|$|E

25|$|The {{considered}} two-stage {{problem is}} linear because the objective functions and the constraints are linear. Conceptually {{this is not}} essential and one can consider more general two-stage stochastic programs. For example, if the first-stage problem is integer, one <b>could</b> <b>add</b> integrality constraints to the first-stage problem so that the feasible set is discrete. Non-linear objectives and constraints could also be incorporated if needed.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} axioms are axioms only in {{the sense}} that, when defining the notion of topological space, one <b>could</b> <b>add</b> these conditions as extra axioms to get a more restricted notion of what a topological space is. The modern approach is to fix {{once and for all}} the axiomatization of topological space and then speak of kinds of topological spaces.|$|E
25|$|Most, {{but not all}} {{individual}} studies {{support the}} superiority of the lipase. In one large study, there were no patients with pancreatitis who had an elevated amylase with a normal lipase. Another study found that the amylase <b>could</b> <b>add</b> diagnostic value to the lipase, but only if the results of the two tests were combined with a discriminant function equation.|$|E
