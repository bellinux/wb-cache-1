40|$|Adsorption is the {{attraction}} of gas molecules {{to the surface of}} an activated solid. There are two classifications of adsorption: physical and chemical. At ordinary temperatures, adsorption is usually caused by molecular forces rather than by the formation of chemical bonds. In this type of adsorption, called physical adsorption, very little heat is evolved. If a chemical reaction takes place between the gas and the solid surface, the process is known as chemisorption. In chemisorption the reaction between surface and gas molecules occurs in a stoichiometric manner, and heat is liberated during the reaction. Chemisorption is used in the removal of UF 6 and HF from gaseous effluent streams. It is also used to remove oil mist from vacuum pumps operating upstream of gaseous effluent ventilation systems. Adsorbent materials are placed on stationary beds in <b>chemical</b> <b>traps</b> downstream of the various cold traps. These materials capture HF and the trace amounts of UF 6 that escape desublimation during feed purification or during venting of residual UF 6 contained in hoses and/or piping that is bled down before disconnection.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the hydrogenation of ortho-, meta- and para-nitroacetophenone to the respective aminoacetophenone in the liquid phase over a Pd/Carbon catalyst. The meta- and para-substituted nitroacetophenones gave high selectivity to the aminoacetophenones; however, the ortho-nitroacetophenone, which was the least reactive of the three isomers, produced 1 -indolinone as well as ortho-aminoacetophenone. The selectivity to 1 -indolinone was typically similar to 10 %. The formation of this product revealed an internal cyclisation reaction. Formation of such a cyclic product Would indicate nitrene insertion into a C-H bond, hence suggesting Ar-N as a surface intermediate in the hydrogenation of the nitro-group.

40|$|The {{method of}} <b>chemical</b> <b>trapping</b> for formyl {{intermediates}} has been studied, with syngas conversion to ethanol over rhodium-based catalysts as the diagnostic reaction concerned, and CH 3 I as the trapping reagent. Two species of acetaldehyde, ie., CH 3 CHO and CH 3 CDO, were {{produced in the}} trapping reaction following CO + 2 D 2 reaction. It was shown that the formation of CH 3 CHO in the trapping reaction resulted from dehydrogenation of CH 3 from CH 3 I to give H, which induced the formation of CH 3 CHO {{in the presence of}} CO and CH 3. So there may be two pathways for the formation of CH 3 CDO in the trapping reaction: one, methylation of DCO adspecies; the other, deuteration of CH 3 CO formed by CO insertion into CH 3. The catalyst surface was purged with Ar following CO + 2 D 2 reaction before the trapping reaction was performed. By means of this modified method of <b>chemical</b> <b>trapping</b> for formyl intermediates, CH 3 CDO was found to be mainly derived from the methylation of DCO adspecies.

Here, as a multifunctional membrane strategy to dispel this stereotypical belief about battery separators, a new class of Janus-faced, dual (ion/electron) -conductive/chemically active battery separators (denoted as Janus separators) based on a heterolayered nanofiber mat architecture is demonstrated. The Janus separator, which is fabricated through in-series, concurrent electrospraying/electrospinning processes, consists of an ion-conductive/metal ion-chelating support layer (a mat of densely packed, thiol-functionalized silica particles spatially besieged by polyvinylpyrrolidone/polyacrylonitrile nanofibers) and a dual-conductive top layer (a thin mat of polyetherimide nanofibers wrapped with multi-walled carbon nanotubes). The support layer acts as a <b>chemical</b> <b>trap</b> that can capture heavy metal ions dissolved in liquid electrolytes and the top layer serves as an upper current collector for cathodes to boost the redox reaction kinetics.

Without the addition of <b>chemicals,</b> <b>trap</b> crops strongly increased germination, with green gram (Vigna radiata) and sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) being particularly effective. There was an interaction between the effects of <b>chemicals</b> and <b>trap</b> crops. A positive effect of trap crops was observed even when there was already strong stimulation by GR 24 at 1. 0 mg kg- 1, but under these conditions, trap crops were less effective at 0. 1 mg kg- 1 GR 24. No differences between cultivars in their effect on O. cernua germination could be detected within one host plant species...|$|R

40|$|<b>Chemical</b> <b>trapping</b> is a {{powerful}} approach for obtaining experimental estimates of interfacial molarities of weakly basic nucleophiles in the interfacial regions of amphiphile aggregates. Here, we demonstrate that the chemical probe 4 -hexadecyl- 2, 6 -dimethylbenzenediazonium ion (16 -ArN 2 +) reacts competitively with interfacial water, with the amide carbonyl followed by cleavage of the headgroups from the tail at the amide oxygen, and with the terminal carboxylate groups in micelles of two N-acyl amino-acid amphiphiles, sodium N-lauroylsarcosinate (SLS) and sodium N-lauroylglycinate (SLG), simple peptide bond model amphiphiles. Interfacial molarities (in moles per liter of interfacial volume) of these three groups were obtained from product yields, assuming that selectivity toward a particular nucleophile compared to water is the same in an aqueous reference solution and in the interfacial region. Interfacial carboxylate group molarities are similar to 1. 5 M in both SLS and SLG micelles, but the concentration of the amide carbonyl for SLS micelles is similar to 4. 6 - 5 times less (ca. 0. 7 M) than that of SLG micelles (similar to 3 M). The proton on the secondary N of SLG helps solubilize the amide bond in the aqueous region, but the methyl on the tertiary N of SLS helps solubilize the amide bond in the micellar core, reducing its reaction with 16 -ArN 2 +. Application of <b>chemical</b> <b>trapping</b> to proteins in membrane mimetic interfaces should {{provide insight into the}} topology of the protein within the interface because trapping of the amide carbonyl and cleavage at the C-N bond occurs only within the interface, and fragment characterization marks those peptide bonds located within the interface. ...|$|R
