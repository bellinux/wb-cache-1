50|$|The {{most common}} {{position}} is I'm <b>Not</b> <b>OK,</b> You're OK. As children {{we see that}} adults are large, strong and competent {{and that we are}} little, weak and often make mistakes, so we conclude I'm <b>Not</b> <b>OK,</b> You're OK. Children who are abused may conclude I'm <b>Not</b> <b>OK,</b> You're <b>Not</b> <b>OK</b> or I'm <b>OK,</b> You're <b>Not</b> <b>OK,</b> but this is much less common. The emphasis of the book is helping people understand how their life position affects their communications (transactions) and relationships with practical examples.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{theoretical}} {{concept of}} existential/life positions describes person’s basic beliefs about oneself and others. Most of authors on TA postulated {{that every person}} has one of four possible basic life positions: I’m OK, you’re OK; I’m <b>not</b> <b>OK,</b> you’re OK; I’m <b>OK,</b> you’re <b>not</b> <b>OK</b> and I’m <b>not</b> <b>OK,</b> you’re <b>not</b> <b>OK.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was the authentication of Existential positions as theoretical concepts in Transaction Analysis, and it’s potential to discriminate clinical from non-clinical examinees, and paranoid from depressive examinees within the clinical population. Subjects and methods: The research conducted was co-relational. The sample belongs to the convenience sample type, and comprised 200 examinees, 100 from the non-clinical and 100 from the clinical population of adults. Results: The results of the research confirm a statistically significant difference between the non-clinical and clinical part of the sample in the examined theoretical concept. The “I am not OK” existential position is more expressed in the clinical part of the sample. The differences between the examinees with depressive and paranoid disorders indicate that the examinees with the depressive disorder are more likely to express the “I am <b>not</b> <b>OK,</b> you are OK” and “I am <b>not</b> <b>OK,</b> you are <b>not</b> OK” Existential position. Conclusion: In general, we can infer that the assumptions which the research was aimed at testing received partial validation. Examinees from the clinical part of the sample have a statistically significantly higher score at the position “I am not OK”. Examinees with depressive characteristics have a more pronounced “I am <b>not</b> <b>OK,</b> you are <b>not</b> OK” position...|$|R

Unevenness can be removed {{from the surface of the}} fabric through stripping and then re-dyeing can give the fabric new look as expected shade, as if it can be said that stripping is an aspect of improving the appearance and evenness.|$|R
