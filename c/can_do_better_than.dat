500|$|Fanning {{first met}} Powderfinger guitarist Ian Haug in a University of Queensland {{economics}} class in 1989. At {{the time of}} the meeting, Haug had recently formed Powderfinger with high school friends John Collins and Steven Bishop, who would become the band's foundational bass guitarist and drummer, respectively. Haug was the lead guitarist and lead singer. On discovering Fanning's singing abilities, Haug replaced himself with Fanning as lead singer and frontman. Haug stated that [...] "It was a big thing to convince the others that we needed a singer. They were like, 'You're OK,' and I was like, 'No I'm not. We <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> that.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{tries to}} avoid meeting with Wesley (Michael Sheen), the British man she met and flirted with {{while under the}} {{influence}} of anesthesia. Liz finds him to be annoying, but they continually run into each other, which leads them to believe they are meant to be together. However, after visiting the dentist office where they met, Liz and Wesley {{come to terms with the}} fact that the anesthesia was the cause of whatever they experienced, and agree to stop seeing each other. But when they run into each other yet again, Wesley suggests that they should probably just [...] "settle" [...] for one another. Liz is horrified at this prospect and consults Jack for advice, but he is still disconsolate at the prospect of [...] "settling" [...] for a company without upward momentum, and cannot help her. Later, Liz meets Wesley to tell him her answer is no, and she believes both of them <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> being with each other; she is further dismayed to learn he shares his name with actor Wesley Snipes.|$|E

500|$|Of Smith's {{performance}} as Joey, O'Donovan opined that: [...] "For most drama series {{the presence of}} a key new character would have a tangible impact. But not Jonathan Creek, where characterisation has never been done in anything but the broadest brush strokes. Both Caroline Quentin and Julia Sawalha have previously filled the generic role of Creek's pushy, inquisitive partner pretty much interchangeably. Smith was no different. Ten minutes in and we'd forgotten she was anyone new." [...] In contrast, Mark Wright, reviewing the episode for The Stage, praised Smith's {{performance as}} Joey, deeming her to be [...] "a much more satisfying sidekick" [...] than Julia Sawalha's Carla Borrego. He enjoyed the on-screen relationship between the two lead actors, writing that: [...] "it’s the interplay between Davies and Smith that makes this really special." [...] Scotland on Sundays Chitra Ramaswamy discussed the nostalgia invoked by the series' return, alongside The Royle Family, Blackadder and Shooting Stars—other major shows which returned for 2008 Christmas specials. Ramaswamy wrote: [...] "all the comforting, well kent faces are back to soothe us through these dismal times. In a culture that {{is becoming more and more}} risk-averse, it's the oldies but goodies that we trust." [...] Sian Brewis for the Leicester Mercury also considered this nostalgia angle, but concluded that: [...] "Jonathan Creek is the sort of auld acquaintance you’re happy to see once a year – any more than that, you feel, and his mannerisms would start to grate." [...] She deemed the episode: [...] "Less a blast from the past as a shuffling [...] "excuse me". Conversely, Anne Pickles for the News and Star wrote that a one-off special was not enough, and [...] "what we really wanted was a brand new series". Pickles said of the episode: [...] "It’s the gentle, facially expressive, deeply sceptical, somehow slightly daft performance of Davies as Creek that makes this sleuthing drama such a glory. But a one-off? Oh come on... you <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite his postwar claims, Dönitz {{was seen}} as {{supportive}} of Nazism during the war. Several naval officers described him as [...] "closely tied to Hitler and Nazi ideology".

Another event, in which he spoke to Hitler Youth in what was defined as an [...] "inappropriate way", earned him the nickname of [...] "Hitler Youth Dönitz".
