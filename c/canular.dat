50|$|Rolls-Royce gas {{generators}} were used. With little modification, these had been adapted to burn diesel oil {{with a high}} degree of reliability. They were developed from the well-tried aircraft engine used in the Comet and Caravelle aircraft. It had a single-shaft engine with a 17-stage axial flow compressor and <b>canular</b> combustion chamber, before reaching the three-stage turbine.|$|E
50|$|The J55 {{looked like}} a {{conventional}} axial-flow engine overall, but the equipment section was located {{in front of the}} engine in an oversized spinner area. Behind the spinner was the intake area and the supersonic compressor stage. Behind this was the single centrifugal stage, in a separate cylindrical section. This was followed by a <b>canular</b> combustion area and then a single turbine stage.|$|E

Seventy adult Wistar rats were randomly divided into seven groups (n= 10) and administered drugs or distilled water orally using a metallic <b>canular</b> for 60 days.

40|$|The novel J'irai cracher sur vos tombes, {{which was}} famously {{written by the}} black American author Vernon Sullivan and {{translated}} into French by Boris Vian only to be outed subsequently as a hoax, is generally understood precisely as a simple prank or <b>canular.</b> A close reading of the text, however, reveals multiple layers of mise en abyme, which correspond to the work's equally thickly layered paratextual frame. This article explores the various reflexive devices used throughout the novel, considering them {{in the framework of}} its preface, foreword, afterword, and various newspaper articles and legal documents. This book, which is as underrated as it is famous, and in which the diegesis vies for space, at times subtly and at others flagrantly, with the ever-encroaching real world of the hors-texte, in fact raises a number of questions about literary creation, parody, authorial power, and translation.
