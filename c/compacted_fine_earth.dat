40|$|Soils {{developed}} on garnet-rich micaschist in the Southern Cameroon plateau were investigated. Morphologically, two weathering materials constituted the study profile, <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> and nodules. Each material has a singular evolution from the coarse saprolite {{to the upper}} set of clayey and loose horizons. There is Al 2 O 3 enrichment in the <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> concomitantly to Fe 2 O 3, Na 2 O and K 2 O enrichment in nodules in major element–Al 2 O 3 variation diagrams. A–CN–K and A–CNK–FM diagrams show a progressive depletion of Al in nodules concomitantly to an enrichment of this element in the <b>fine</b> <b>earth.</b> Three pedogenetic processes emerge from the evolution of weathering products. There is a ferruginization process whose importance increases from the coarse saprolite to the upper set of clayey and loose horizons, giving rise {{to the formation of}} dense nodules composed of hematite, goethite and gibbsite. This ferruginization occurs concomitantly with a desaluminization process, which causes Al 2 O 3 depletion in nodules. These nodules are formed by the process of induration where the hydrated amorphous hydroxide and oxides are dehydrated to their crystalline oxide form, due to condensation. In addition, there is aluminization, which occurs in the <b>fine</b> <b>earth,</b> leading {{to the development of a}} red clayey material composed of kaolinite and gibbsite...|$|R

In this paper, the potential fertility {{in terms of}} exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K of rock fragments from sandstone and siltstone derived soils from northern Apennines (Italy) is reported and contrasted {{with that of the}} <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> (particles < 2 mm). The results show that rock fragments are a source of Ca, Mg, and K.

50|$|Rain causes {{castings}} to {{move down}} an incline; Darwin {{worked out the}} weight moving a certain distance in a given time. Some also roll down, and collect in drains etc., or get blown. There is a greater effect on casting movement in the tropics, because of increased rain. The <b>finest</b> <b>earth</b> is washed away. Ledges on hillsides, formerly believed {{to be caused by}} grazing mammals, are partly due to casting accumulations. High winds, especially gales, are almost as effective as the slope/rain in moving castings. Crowns and furrows of formerly ploughed lands slowly vanish when under pasture, due to worms, but more slowly when there is no incline. <b>Fine</b> <b>earth</b> is washed down from slopes, making a shallow layer. Dissolving of chalk supplies new earth.|$|R
60|$|In old pasture fields, the mould, {{wherever}} {{measurements were}} made, {{was found to}} be from 0.5 to 2 inches thicker in the furrows than on the crowns; but this would naturally follow from the <b>finer</b> <b>earth</b> having been washed from the crowns into the furrows before the land was well clothed with turf; and it is impossible to tell what part worms may have played in the work. Nevertheless from what we have seen, castings would certainly tend to flow and to be washed during heavy rain from the crowns into the furrows. But as soon as a bed of <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> had by any means been accumulated in the furrows, it would be more favourable for worms than the other parts, and a greater number of castings would be thrown up here than elsewhere; and as the furrows on sloping land are usually directed so as to carry off the surface water, some of the <b>finest</b> <b>earth</b> would be washed from the castings which had been here ejected and be carried completely away. The result would be that the furrows would be filled up very slowly, while the crowns would be lowered perhaps still more slowly by the flowing and rolling of the castings down their gentle inclinations into the furrows.|$|R
40|$|Bricks are {{regularly}} found in urban soils {{where they can}} strongly impact soil properties. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate abundance, especially in the <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> fraction, and properties of bricks in urban soils, focusing on rooting, plant nutrition and contamination. Three different urban soils from the city of Berlin have been studied for their brick contents in the coarse and <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> fractions by hand sorting. Light (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to investigate bricks for proofs of rooting. Third, CEC, pH, EC, C-org, nutrient and contaminant storage and availability have been investigated for bricks and the <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> fractions of the corresponding soil horizons. The <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> fractions of the investigated soils contain 3 to 5 % of bricks, while the coarse fractions contain up to 50 %. The LM and SEM micrographs made the proof that roots enter brick pores or attach to brick surfaces. Therefore, they can use the water and nutrients stored in bricks and bypass pore system discontinuities between bricks and surrounding soil. The CEC of bricks is grain size dependent and reaches a maximum of 6 cmol(c) kg(- 1) for particles smaller than 0. 063 mm. This dependency is the result of the restricted diffusion into the brick pore system due to the short shaking time in the CEC analysis protocol and of the rising surface with decreasing particle size. From the nutrient storage and availability, we conclude that bricks can better supply plants with K, Mg, Ca and S than the investigated sandy bulk soil. The nutrient availability from bricks is low compared to control soils, except for Ca and S. Because of the water and nutrient storage, low contamination status and the possible rooting of bricks, they can be used for amelioration of poor sandy soils and for constructed Technosols, preferably employed in small grain sizes...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{fragments}} in soil {{can contain}} {{significant amounts of}} organic carbon. We investigated the nature and dynamics of organic matter in rock fragments in the upper horizons of a forest soil derived from sandstone and compared them with the <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> fraction (< 2 mm). The organic C content and its distribution among humic, humin and non-humic fractions, {{as well as the}} isotopic signatures (&UDelta;(14) C and δC- 13) of organic carbon and Of CO 2 produced during incubation of samples, all show that altered rock fragments contain a dynamic component of the carbon cycle. Rock fragments, especially the highly altered ones, contributed 4. 5 % to the total organic C content in the soil. The bulk organic matter in both <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> and highly altered rock fragments in the Al horizon contained significant amounts of recent C (bomb C- 14), indicating that most of this C is cycled quickly in both fractions. In the A horizons, the mean residence times of humic substances from highly altered rock fragments were shorter than those of the humic substances isolated in the <b>fine</b> <b>earth.</b> Values of &UDelta;C- 14 of the CO 2 produced during basal respiration confirmed the heterogeneity, complexity and dynamic nature of the organic matter of these rock fragments. The weak C- 14 signatures of humic substances from the slightly altered rock fragments confirmed the importance of weathering in establishing and improving the interactions between rock fragments and surrounding soil. The progressive enrichment in C- 13 from components with high-C- 14 (more recent) to low-C- 14 (older) indicated that biological activity occurred in both the fine and the coarse fractions. Hence the microflora utilizes energy sources contained in all the soil compartments, and rock fragments are chemically and biologically active in soil, where they form a continuum with the <b>fine</b> <b>earth...</b>|$|R

60|$|In these {{calculations}} it {{has been}} assumed that the castings flow a short distance downwards during the whole year, but this occurs only with those ejected during or shortly before rain; so that the above results are thus far exaggerated. On the other hand, during rain much of the <b>finest</b> <b>earth</b> is washed to a considerable distance from the castings, even where the slope is an extremely gentle one, and is thus wholly lost {{as far as the}} above calculations are concerned. Castings ejected during dry weather and which have set hard, lose in the same manner a considerable quantity of <b>fine</b> <b>earth.</b> Dried castings, moreover, are apt to disintegrate into little pellets, which often roll or are blown down any inclined surface. Therefore the above result, namely, that 24 cubic inches of earth (weighing 1.85 oz. whilst damp) annually crosses a yard- line of the specified kind, is probably not much if at all exaggerated.|$|R
40|$|Chiselling in air-dry soils can rapidly create inverse grading of the plough layer as field {{experiments}} showed, i. e., {{the largest}} particles (rock fragments) {{are brought to}} the surface and the smallest particles concentrate {{at the bottom of the}} plough layer. Since no information about the effect of soil moisture and <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> characteristics on this process is available laboratory experiments were conducted to examine the effect of soil moisture and <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> characteristics on the vertical movement (segregation) of rock fragments due to tillage. An experimental trough, 120 x 60 x 40 cm(3), was filled with three layers (each 4 cm thick) of <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> (sand or silt loam), and rock fragments (1. 2 - 2. 2 and 2. 7 - 4. 0 cm). Tillage was simulated by moving a hand-held cultivator through the mixture. The results for the sandy soil matrix showed that inter-particle percolation was slowed down by soil moisture, however, at the same rate for different moisture levels. This was attributed to water-films that surround the sand particles. In the silt-loam soil matrix inter-particle percolation was stronger than that occurring in the sandy matrix at similar volumetric moisture contents but vertical movement was impossible at higher moisture contents (0. 17 m(3) m(- 3)) because of a strong increase in stickiness. The results imply that at low moisture contents farmers in areas threatened by desertification can use moderate tillage as a means to create a surface rich in rock fragments which helps to increase water infiltration and decrease erosion.

40|$|To {{understand}} better {{the role of}} rock fragments in {{soil and water conservation}} processes, the effects of rock fragments in maintaining a favourable soil structure and thus also in preventing physical degradation of tilled soils was studied. Laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of rock fragment content, rock fragment size, initial soil moisture content of the <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> and surface rock fragment cover on soil subsidence by rainfall (i. e. change in bulk density by one or more cycles of wetting and drying). A total of 15 rainfall simulations (cumulative rainfall, 192. 5 mm; mean intensity, 70 mm h(- 1)) were carried out. Before and after each rainfall application the surface elevation of a 19 -cm thick plough layer was measured with a laser microrelief meter. In all experiments, the bulk density of the <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> increased with applied rainfall volume to reach a maximum value at about 200 mm of cumulative rainfall. From the experimental results it was concluded that the subsidence rate decreased sharply for soils containing more than 0. 50 kg kg(- 1) rock fragments, irrespective of rock fragment size. <b>Fine</b> <b>earth</b> bulk densities were negatively related to rock fragment content beyond a threshold value of 0. 30 kg kg(- 1) for small rock fragments (1. 7 - 2. 7 cm) and 0. 50 kg kg(- 1) for large rock fragments (7. 7 cm). Initial soil moisture content influenced subsidence only in the initial stage of the experiments, when some swelling occurred in the dry soils, Surface rock fragment cover had no significant effect on subsidence of the plough layer. Therefore, subsidence of the plough layer in these experiments appears to be mainly due to changing soil strength upon drainage rather than the result of direct transfer of kinetic energy from falling drops, The relative increase in porosity of the <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> as well as the absolute increase in macroporosity with rock fragment content will cause deeper penetration of rainfall into the soil, resulting in water conservation. Therefore, crushing of large rock fragments into smaller ones is to be preferred over removal of rock fragments from the plough layer. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Evaporation from {{bare soil}} {{surfaces}} represents an important water loss for agriculture in semi-arid regions, Numerous {{efforts have been}} undertaken to modify the topsoil characteristics (mulching, tillage) {{in order to create}} a thin dry topsoil that reduces evaporation. However, little attention was paid to the role of natural rock fragments in topsoils with respect to evaporation. This paper presents the results of laboratory experiments simulating evaporation from initially wet and air-dry soils containing a range of rock fragment contents, and compares them to field conditions, Evaporation was stimulated by blowing fans at one (high) evaporative demand (E(o) = 7. 7 - 9. 2 mm day(- 1)). Time domain reflectometry (TDR) was used to investigate the relation between the water content of the topsoil and the actual evaporation rate. For soils at field capacity, initial <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> water content decreases with rock fragment content, and consequently evaporation rates decrease in the same order. For air-dry soils that received a limited amount of rain (10 and 20 mm), an opposite behaviour was observed. Initial <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> water content and evaporation rates increase with rock fragment content. A strong positive sigmoidal relation between relative evaporation rate (actual over open-pan evaporation rates) and <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> water content in the centre of the wetted soil section was observed during the laboratory experiments. Except for the columns covered with a mulch, there were no systematic differences in this relation between the treatments, A rock fragment mulch reduces evaporation rate at a given soil water content significantly, These trends explain the often ambivalent effects of rock fragments on evaporation rates in the field. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Tillage erosion is {{increasingly}} recognised {{as an important}} soil erosion process on agricultural land. In view of its potential significance, {{there is a clear}} need to broaden the experimental database far the magnitude of tillage erosion to include a range of tillage implements and agricultural environments. The study discussed in this paper sought to address the need for such data by examining tillage erosion by a duckfoot chisel plough in stony soils on steep slopes in a semi-arid environment. Results of the investigation of coarse fraction (rock fragment) translocation by tillage in this environment have been presented elsewhere and the paper focuses on tillage translocation and erosion of the <b>fine</b> <b>earth.</b> Tillage translocation was measured at 10 sites, representing both upslope and downslope tillage by a duckfoot chisel plough on five different slopes, with tangents ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 41. A fine-earth tracer, comprising <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> labelled with Cs- 134, was introduced into the plough layer before tillage. After a single pass of the plough, incremental samples of plough soil were excavated and sieved to separate the <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> from the rock fragments,Translocation of the fine-earth tracer was established by analysing the 134 Cs content of the samples of <b>fine</b> <b>earth.</b> These data were used to establish translocation distances for each combination of slope and tillage direction. Translocation distances of the <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> were not significantly different from translocation distances of the coarse fraction. For all sites, except uphill on the 0. 41 slope, translocation distances were found to be linearly related to slope tangent. The soil flux due to tillage for each site was calculated using the translocation distance and the mass per unit area of the plough layer. For slopes with tangents < 0. 25, the relationship between soil flux and tangent was linear and the soil flux coefficient derived was 520 - 660 kg m(- 1) per pass. This is much larger than the coefficients found in other studies and this high magnitude is attributed to the non-cohesive nature and high rock fragment content of the soil in this investigation. A second contrast with previous studies was found in non-linearity in the relationship between soil flux and tangent when steeper slopes were included. This was a product of variation in plough depth between the steepest slopes and the remainder of the study area. On the basis of the study it is suggested that an improved understanding of tillage erosion may be obtained by considering the dual processes of tillage detachment (mass per unit area of soil subject to tillage) and tillage displacement (equivalent to translocation distance per pass) in assessing, comparing and modelling tillage translocation. An improved model is proposed that recognises the complexity of soil redistribution by tillage, provides a framework for process-based investigation of the controls on tillage fluxes, and allows identification of potential self-limiting conditions for tillage erosion.

40|$|AbstractMany arable soils have {{significant}} horizon-specific gravel content levels. Just how these influence compaction behaviour, {{and in particular}} precompression stress as an important criterion of a soil's susceptibility to compaction, {{has yet to be}} sufficiently clarified. This article is intended to contribute towards answering this question. Firstly, three different <b>fine</b> <b>earths,</b> from the “Clay”, “Silt Loam” and “Sandy Loam” soil texture classes were mixed with staggered proportions (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 % by volume) of a quartz gravel (the shape of which was subrounded to rounded, average weighted diameter 6 mm). Soil core samplers were filled with the mixtures at a typical density for a natural site. In the case of the 30 % by volume variant only, in addition to the quartz gravel an angular to subangular limestone gravel with the same size graduation was also used. The tests were supplemented by 20 samples from a natural site; the gravel content of these varied between 0. 1 and 23. 5 % by volume. All of the disturbed and natural samples were adjusted to a water content at a matric potential of − 6 kPa. Subsequently, an oedometer test was used to apply loads to them in stages (5 – 550 kPa). Precompression stress was calculated using the resulting stress–bulk density functions. While <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> bulk density remained constant, the staggered addition of quartz gravel led to an increase in the whole soil density after packing, and thus also to a vertical shift in overall stress–bulk density functions. However, the stress–density functions of the <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> do show that the overall compaction of <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> decreased as gravel content increased. In the case of low gravel content levels of no more than 10 % by volume, the increase in precompression stress (log) in the disturbed samples was, on the whole, very low. In the disturbed samples, however, as gravel content increased precompression stress (log) increased exponentially. Contrary to this, a continuous linear increase in precompression stress (log) could be observed with increasing gravel content in the natural samples. The angular to subangular shape of the gravel only resulted in greater precompression stress (log) in the “Silt Loam”. At gravel-rich sites, gravel content influences soil compaction behaviour and precompression stress very strongly. For this reason, it is essential that it be considered when assessing such sites' risk of compaction damage...|$|R

If the burrows did not collapse, the whole ground would be first thickly riddled with holes to a depth of about ten inches, and in fifty years a hollow unsupported space, ten inches in depth, would be left. The holes left by the decay of successively formed roots of trees and plants must likewise collapse in the course of time.|$|R

Is there a need to make adjustments to treatment requirements in excessively permeable (Type 1 A) soils? If so, what changes should be made? Summary: This report summarizes the literature on the topic of Type 1 Soil issues for on-site sewage systems. Numerous studies have demonstrated that bacteria, viral, and nutrient movement presents a potential problem in excessively permeable soils. The rapid flow of effluent through macropores decreases treatment because of reduced soil surface area and retention time. In this situation, inadequate treatment in the unsaturated zone might allow wastewater contaminants to enter the ground water if no mitigating measures are taken. There is little research that has clearly demonstrated at what point the percent gravel fraction of the native soil results in a treatment problem. Several studies indicate that conventional gravity systems are ineffective in treating domestic wastewater in coarse textured soils. Research have shown that when hydraulic loading rates are too high or the dosing frequency is too low, wastewater constituents can be transported to lower regions in the soil, posing a treatment concern in systems that are close to ground water. Improved treatment of microbiological and chemical constituents can result from mor...|$|R
40|$|Most glacier forefields of the European Alps {{are being}} {{progressively}} exposed since the glaciers reached their maximum {{expansion in the}} 1850 s. Global warming and climate changes additionally promote the exposure of sediments in previously glaciated areas. In these proglacial areas, initial soils have started to develop {{so that they may}} offer a continuous chronosequence from 0 to 150 -yr-old soils. The build-up of organic matter is an important factor of soil formation, and not only autochthonous but also distant sources might contribute to its accumulation in young soils and surfaces of glacier forefields. Only little is known about black carbon in soils that develop in glacier forefields, although charred organic matter could be an important component of organic carbon in Alpine soils. The aim of our study was to examine whether black carbon (BC) is present in the initial soils of a proglacial area, and to estimate its relative contribution to soil organic matter. We investigated soil samples from 35 sites distributed over the whole proglacial area of Morteratsch (Upper Engadine, Switzerland), covering a chronosequence from 0 to 150 yr. BC concentrations were determined in <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> using the benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) marker method. We found that charred organic matter occurred in the whole area, and that it was a main compound of soil organic matter in the youngest soils, where total C org concentrations were very low. The absolute concentrations of BC in <b>fine</b> <b>earth</b> were generally low but increased in soils that had been exposed for more than 40 yr. Specific initial microbial communities may profit from this additional C source during the first years of soil evolution and potentially promote soil development in its early stage...|$|R
