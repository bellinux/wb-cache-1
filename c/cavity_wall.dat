5|$|The {{middle ear}} and its {{components}} develop {{from the first}} and second pharyngeal arches. The tympanic cavity and auditory tube develop from {{the first part of the}} pharyngeal pouch between the first two arches in an area which will also go on to develop the pharynx. This develops as a structure called the tubotympanic recess. The ossicles (malleus, incus and stapes) normally appear during the first half of fetal development. The first two (malleus and incus) derive from the first pharyngeal arch and the stapes derives from the second. All three ossicles develop from the neural crest. Eventually cells from the tissue surrounding the ossicles will experience apoptosis and a new layer of endodermal epithelial will constitute the formation of the tympanic <b>cavity</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E

25|$|The advent {{during the}} mid twentieth century of the <b>cavity</b> <b>wall</b> saw the popularisation and {{development}} of another method of strengthening brickwork—the wall tie. A <b>cavity</b> <b>wall</b> comprises two totally discrete walls, separated by an air gap, which serves both as barrier to moisture and heat. Typically the main loads taken by the foundations are carried there by the inner leaf, and the major functions of the external leaf are to protect the whole from weather, {{and to provide a}} fitting aesthetic finish.|$|E

25|$|A serous {{membrane}} (also {{referred to as}} a serosa) is a thin membrane that covers the walls of organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The {{serous membrane}}s have two layers; parietal and visceral, surrounding a fluid filled space. The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organ (the viscera), and the parietal layer lines the walls of the body cavity (pariet- refers to a <b>cavity</b> <b>wall).</b> Between the parietal and visceral layers is a very thin, fluid-filled serous space, or cavity. For example, the pericardium is the serous cavity which surrounds the heart.|$|E

This loss mechanism limits the maximum amount of energy/power supported by the cavities. Optimal designs have been identified in others’ studies. In practice, these designs are not easily manufactured. Chemical etching processes used to polish the <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> result in a nonuniform surface etch compromising the optimal geometrical design. Past multipacting studies have not examined the impact of wall perturbations. It is the purpose of this study to examine the chemical etching process in the design of niobium cavities so to maximize the surface quality of the <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> while minimizing the multipacting losses. Single and multiple cavity cell geometries are to be investigated. Optimization techniques will be applied in search of the chemical etching processes, which will lead to <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> with near ideal properties...|$|R

2500|$|This Canton Viaduct is {{the first}} and {{possibly}} only viaduct to use both a blind arcade and <b>cavity</b> <b>wall</b> structure. [...] The structure {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "multiple arch bridge", but it does not fit the classic definition of spanning a distance between two points. [...] Although the deck arches appear to extend through to other side, they do not; each deck arch is only four feet deep. [...] The deck arches support the spandrels, deck (beyond the walls), coping and parapets; they are not tied to the longitudinal walls. [...] The only arches that extend through to the other side are six river portals and two roadway portals. [...] The 'buttresses' are also unique in that they extend through to the other side, so they are actually transverse walls. [...] Due to its use of double walls and lack of open arches, the Canton Viaduct is more accurately described as a blind arcade <b>cavity</b> <b>wall.</b> [...] The Thomas Viaduct (Maryland, 1835) and Starrucca Viaduct (Pennsylvania, 1847) are classic examples of multiple arch viaducts, as their primary support system consists of open semi-circular arches spanning the distance between piers, without any walls.|$|E

40|$|After {{world war}} two, <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> became a {{widespread}} external wall {{type in the}} cool but humid climate of North Western Europe. Moisture tolerance of the unfilled construction was excellent. Instead, calculation and testing underlined that the unfilled <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> of that era performed poorly from a thermal insulation point of view. After the energy crisis of 1973, cavity filling was therefore introduced as the main upgrade. Hence, extensive testing revealed upgrading was less simple than expected. Air in- and exfiltration through the wall, wind washing behind the fill, thermal stack induced air looping around the fill and thermal bridging all cooperated in lowering expected thermal quality of the filled walls. Anyhow, {{at the same time}} testing underlined that moisture tolerance remained outstanding in the cool, humid climate of North Western Europe also without cavity ventilation.

40|$|Abstract. Local {{polymerization}} stress occurs due to polymerization shrinkage of resin based composites adhesively {{bonded to}} tooth tissues. Shrinkage causes local displacements of <b>cavity</b> <b>walls,</b> with possible occurrence of micro-cracks in the enamel, dentin and/or material itself. In order {{to design a}} cavity for experimental testing of polymerization shrinkage of dental composites using 3 D optical analysis, in this paper finite element method (FEM) was used to analyze numerical models with different cavity radiuses. 3 D optical strain and displacement analysis of composite materials and <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> is limited by equipment sensitivity i. e. 0. 01 % for strain and 1 micron for displacement. This paper presents the development of 3 D computer premolar models with varying cavity radiuses, and local stress, strain and displacement analysis using FEM. Model verification was performed by comparing obtained results with data from the scientific literature. Using the FEM analysis of local strains, displacements and stresses exerted on <b>cavity</b> <b>walls,</b> {{it was concluded that}} the model with 1 mm radius was optimal for experimental optical 3 D displacement analysis...|$|R

This paper will present the full derivation of the author&# 039;s theory of the air borne sound transmission of double leaf <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> due to the structure borne sound transmission across the air cavity via point or line connections which are modeled as four pole networks. The theoretical results will be compared with experimental results on wooden stud <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> from the National Research Council of Canada because the screw spacing is given for these results.

40|$|Since 1978 superconducting coupled {{cavities}} {{have been}} proposed as sensitive detector of gravitational waves. The interaction of the gravitational wave with the <b>cavity</b> <b>walls,</b> and the resulting motion, induces the transition of some electromagnetic energy from an initially excited cavity mode to an empty one. The energy transfer is maximum when {{the frequency of the}} wave is equal to the frequency difference of the two cavity modes. In this paper the basic principles of the detector are discussed. The interaction of a gravitational wave with the <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> is studied in the proper reference frame of the detector, and the coupling between two electromagnetic normal modes induced by the wall motion is analyzed in detail. Noise sources are also considered; in particular the noise coming from the brownian motion of the <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> is analyzed. Some ideas for the developement of a realistic detector of gravitational waves are discussed; the outline of a possible detector design and its expected sensitivity are also shown.

When lesions did develop, they did not penetrate as far along the <b>cavity</b> <b>walls</b> adjacent to the experimental materials.
