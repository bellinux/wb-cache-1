5|$|On July 12, 1985, President Ronald Reagan {{underwent}} a <b>colonoscopy,</b> during which a villous adenoma (a pre-cancerous lesion) was discovered.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{studies show}} that <b>colonoscopies</b> are {{technically}} more difficult to perform in women than men, especially in women who have undergone abdominal and gynecological surgeries.

40|$|Discrete event {{simulation}} {{was used}} to model a population-based colorectal cancer screening program. The demand of <b>colonoscopies,</b> including <b>colonoscopies</b> after a positive fecal-occult blood test and surveillance <b>colonoscopies</b> after a premalignant finding, were estimated, with a special focus on sensitivity analysis on the main factors affecting colonosocopy demand and territorial predictions according to the incoming extension of the Program in all regions of Catalonia. Results of the sensitivity analysis showed that FIT positivity is far the most sensitive variable. Territorial results were calculated for each endoscopic unit of Catalonia and an interactive and user-friendly application was developed to make results available to decision-makers. The model predicts a relevant increase in future demand of <b>colonoscopies</b> and, thus, raises the need of careful planning of healthcare resources...|$|R

25|$|A 2003 {{analysis}} of the relative risks of sigmoidoscopy and <b>colonoscopy,</b> brought into attention {{that the risk of}} perforation after <b>colonoscopy</b> is approximately double that after sigmoidoscopy (consistent with the fact that <b>colonoscopy</b> examines a longer section of the colon), even though this difference appeared to be decreasing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Colonoscopy</b> {{is similar}} to sigmoidoscopy—the {{difference}} being related to which parts of the colon each can examine. A <b>colonoscopy</b> allows {{an examination of the}} entire colon (1200–1500mm in length). A sigmoidoscopy allows an examination of the distal portion (about 600mm) of the colon, which may be sufficient because benefits to cancer survival of <b>colonoscopy</b> have been limited to the detection of lesions in the distal portion of the colon.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Individuals with {{a family}} history of {{colorectal}} cancer (CRC) are at increased risk for CRC. Current screening recommendations for these individuals are based on expert opinion. The authors investigated optimal screening strategies for individuals with various degrees of family history of CRC based on a cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: The MISCAN-Colon microsimulation model was used to estimate costs and effects of CRC screening strategies, varying by the age at which screening was started and stopped and by screening interval. The authors defined 4 risk groups, characterized by the number of affected first-degree relatives and their age at CRC diagnosis. For all risk groups, the optimal screening strategy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately $ 50, 000 per life-year gained. RESULTS: The optimal screening strategy for individuals with 1 first-degree relative diagnosed after age 50 years was 6 <b>colonoscopies</b> every 5 years starting at age 50 years, compared with 4 <b>colonoscopies</b> every 7 years starting at age 50 years for average risk individuals. The optimal strategy had 10 <b>colonoscopies</b> every 4 years for individuals with 1 first-degree relative diagnosed before age 50 years, 13 <b>colonoscopies</b> every 3 years for individuals with 2 or more first-degree relatives diagnosed after age 50 years, and 15 <b>colonoscopies</b> every 3 years for individuals with 2 or more first-degree relatives of whom at least 1 was diagnosed before age 50 years. CONCLUSIONS: The optimal screening strategy varies considerably with the number of affected first-degree relatives and their age of diagnosis. Shorter screening intervals than the currently recommended 5 years may be appropriate for the highest risk individuals...|$|R

25|$|<b>Colonoscopy</b> {{is one of}} the {{colorectal}} cancer screening tests available to people in the US who are over 50 years of age.

40|$|Background: Colorectal {{cancer is}} the third most {{commonly}} diagnosed cancer and the second leading {{cause of cancer death}} in Arizona. Given that by the year 2030 Arizona {{is expected to be the}} second most populated state in the U. S., it is imperative to evaluate whether this state has the colorectal screening capacity to accommodate the growing population. Methods: 338 members of the American College of Gastroenterology were invited to participate. Information for the total number of <b>colonoscopies</b> and sigmoidoscopies performed during an average week was ascertained by analyzing 105 surveys. We estimated the current and potential volume of screening procedures. Results: Physicians reported performing 8, 717 endoscopic procedures weekly (7, 990 <b>colonoscopies</b> and 727 sigmoidoscopies). They reported being able to increase their capacity by an additional 3, 183 (36. 5 %) procedures a week (2, 347 <b>colonoscopies</b> and 836 flexible sigmoidoscopies). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Arizona has the ability to significantly expand its endoscopic capacity...|$|R

25|$|The terms <b>colonoscopy</b> or coloscopy {{are derived}} from the ancient Greek noun κόλον, same as English colon, and the verb σκοπεῖν, look (in)to, examine. The term <b>colonoscopy</b> is however ill-constructed, as this form supposes that {{the first part of}} the {{compound}} consists of a possible root κολωv- or κολοv-, with the connecting vowel -o, instead of the root κόλ- of κόλον. A compound such as κολωνοειδής, like a hill, (with the additional -on-) is derived from the ancient Greek word κολώνη or κολωνός, hill. Similarly, <b>colonoscopy</b> (with the additional -on-) can literally be translated as examination of the hill, instead of the examination of the colon.|$|E

25|$|Dehydration {{caused by}} the {{laxatives}} that are usually administered during the bowel preparation for <b>colonoscopy</b> also may occur. Therefore, patients must drink large amounts of fluids during the days of <b>colonoscopy</b> preparation to prevent dehydration.

In rare cases, severe dehydration can lead to kidney damage or renal dysfunction under the form of phosphate nephropathy.|$|E

The incidence of CP ranges from 0. 016 % to 0. 2 % following diagnostic <b>colonoscopies</b> {{and could be}} up to 5 % following some colonoscopic interventions. The perforations are frequently related to therapeutic <b>colonoscopies</b> and are associated with patients of advanced age or with multiple comorbidities. Management of CP is mainly based on patients’ clinical grounds and their underlying colorectal diseases. Current therapeutic approaches include conservative management (bowel rest plus the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics), endoscopic management, and operative management (open or laparoscopic approach). The applications of each treatment are discussed. Overall outcomes of patients with CP are also addressed...|$|R
