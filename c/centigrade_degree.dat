40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} effect of Mediterranean seawater summer warming projected for the 21 st century under Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions on Posidonia oceanica sulphide stress. The results reveal that projected warming would enhance sulphide toxicity in P. oceanica and, hence, the risk of seagrass loss. We assessed sulphide stress of seagrasses by estimating the sulphide intrusion (F sulphide) into leaf tissue from the sulphur isotopic signature in sediments (Î¿ 34 S sulphide), {{in the water column}} (Î¿ 34 S sulphate) and in P. oceanica leaves (Î¿ 34 S tissue). Seagrasses were grown at 6 seawater temperature treatments, ranging from 26 Â°C to 32 Â°C, in 3 replicated experimental mesocosms for 50 days. At the end of the experiment, the seagrass shoots in all of the treatments exhibited sulphide intrusion (F sulphide > 0 %), which had been negligible when the experiment started. Similarly, the leaf Î¿ 34 S tissue was lighter {{at the end of the}} experiment than at the beginning, when seagrasses in the field were experiencing a seawater temperature of 23 Â°C. F sulphide linearly increased with experimental warming, while leaf Î¿ 34 S tissue declined with increasing temperature at a rate of 0. 3 â€° for each <b>centigrade</b> <b>degree</b> of warming. The daily production of new leaves per shoot decreased as the sediment became more reduced.

40|$|Introduction: Arsenic is {{a highly}} toxic {{metalloid}} in group 15 of periodic table. The information on environmental behaviour of arsenic, however, is still scarce. Contamination of soils and water with arsenic and antimony due to their widespread industrial application and mining activities has raised serious environmental concerns. Nearly all Arsenic-contaminated soils results from human activities and it has different environmental and sociological impacts. Various strategies and methods have been proposed for environmental management and remediation of contaminated soils. Among all methods, the phytoremediation is receiving more attention due to its cost effective and environmental friendly characteristics. In the case of arsenic contaminated soils, there are effective factors such as soil fertility, nutrients content and microorganisms function, which can improve the uptake of As by plants. Up to now, several studies have been evaluated the effects of symbiotic fungal association in plants on increasing nutrients and toxic elements uptake. Many of authors reported that the mycorrhizal symbiosis increases the uptake of toxic elements in root and shoot of plants and consequently improve the efficacy of phytostabilization and phytoextraction processes. There are conflicting results {{about the effect of}} arbuscular- mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on As uptake by various plants. Chen et al. (4) found that Glomus mosseae symbiosis with plant reduces As concentration and enhance phosphorus content in shoot and root of plant. Whilst Cozzolino et al. (7) reported that the AMF increases as concentration in shoot and root of cabbage. Phosphorus has important role on mycorrhizal symbiosis and also As uptake by plants. Therefore, current study was conducted to evaluated effect of Glomus intraradices and Glomus mosseae symbiosis with sunflower and also soil phosphorus concentration on uptake of arsenic from arsenite and arsenate contaminated soils. Materials and Methods:The soil sample (Typic Haplorthids) was collected, air dried and passed through 2 mm sieve and then were heated in 80 <b>centigrade</b> <b>degree</b> temperature for two times. A pot experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement and three replications in greenhouse condition. The experimental factors included two species spices of inorganic As (50 mg kg- 1 of Arsenite and Arsenate), two levels of phosphorus (0 and 60 mg Kg- 1) and three spices of arbuscular mycorrhizae (control, Glomus intraradices and Glomus mosseae). Soil samples spiked with Na 2 HAsO 4. 7 H 2 O, NaAsO 2 (Arsenite and Arsenate) and Ca (H 2 PO 4) 2 (phosphorus) and incubated in greenhouse condition for 4 week. Sunflower seeds were planted and seedlings harvested after 60 day of sowing and then dry weight of sunflower, concentration of As and phosphorus in shoot and root of plant and root colonization percentage determined using standard methods.

The ATLAS comprises two lasers; {{but only one}} will be used at a time. Each laser will generate between 125 watts and 250 watts of heat, and each laser has its own optimal operating temperature that must be maintained within plus or minus 1 <b>degree</b> <b>Centigrade</b> accuracy by the Laser Thermal Control System (LTCS) consisting of a constant conductance heat pipe (CCHP), a loop heat pipe (LHP) and a radiator. The heat generated by the laser is acquired by the CCHP and transferred to the LHP, which delivers the heat to the radiator for ultimate rejection. The radiator can be exposed to temperatures between minus 71 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade</b> and minus 93 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade.</b> The two lasers can have different operating temperatures varying between plus 15 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade</b> and plus 30 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade,</b> and their operating temperatures are not known while the LTCS is being designed and built. Major challenges of the LTCS include: 1) A single thermal control system must maintain the ATLAS at 15 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade</b> with 250 watts heat load and minus 71 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade</b> radiator sink temperature, and maintain the ATLAS at plus 30 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade</b> with 125 watts heat load and minus 93 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade</b> radiator sink temperature. Furthermore, the LTCS must be qualification tested to maintain the ATLAS between plus 10 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade</b> and plus 35 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade.</b> 2) The LTCS must be shut down {{to ensure that the}} ATLAS can be maintained above its lowest desirable temperature of minus 2 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade</b> during the survival mode. No software control algorithm for LTCS can be activated during survival and only thermostats can be used. 3) The radiator must be kept above minus 65 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade</b> to prevent ammonia from freezing using no more than 135 watts of heater power. 4) The LHP reservoir control heater power is limited to 15 watts with a 70 percent duty cycle. 5) The voltage of the power supply can vary between 26 volts direct current and 34 volts direct current during the spacecraft lifetime. A design analysis shows that a single LTCS can satisfy these requirements. However, shutdown of the LHP is particularly challenging and the shutdown heater must be wired in series with two reservoir thermostats and two CCHP thermostats at different set points. An LTCS demonstration unit has been tested to verify these performance characteristics experimentally prior to proceeding to the final LTCS design and fabrication. Test results showed that the LHP shutdown scheme would be able to shut down the LHP as designed and the reservoir control heater can maintain the ATLAS mass simulator within the plus or minus 1 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade</b> accuracy under various combinations of the heat load, sink temperature, and power supply voltage...|$|R

Moreover, when the deposition temperature was lowered, pore nucleation was also significantly enhanced whereas the crystallinity was slightly decreased as the nucleation mechanism tended to proceed toward progressive nucleation.

Thus, the hypothermia seen at normal and cooler ambient temperature was not {{due to lack of}} BAT activation. Also, activation of BAT by d-fenfluramine was mediated through the sympathetic nervous system and through release of central serotonin, since ganglionic blocker pentolinium and serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine blocked d-fenfluramine-mediated BAT activation. In animals kept at 16 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade,</b> d-fenfluramine increased tail-skin temperature (Tsk), an index of cutaneous vascular tone, indicating that d-fenfluramine produced cutaneous vasodilation. d-fenfluramine-induced increase in Tsk was mediated through withdrawal of the sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone to the tail, since pentolinium blocks this effect. In animals kept at 28 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade,</b> d-fenfluramine produced a decrease in Tsk, indicating vasoconstriction. The effects of d-fenfluramine on the Tsk were mediated through release of serotonin, since fluoxetine blocked these effects. D-fenfluramine increased whole body oxygen consumption, an index of metabolic activity and the increase was due to BAT activation, since pentolinium prevented the increase. Thus, although d-fenfluramine increased metabolic activity through BAT activation, the increase was insufficient {{to make up for the}} heat loss produced by cutaneous vasodilation and thus produces hypothermia. The hyperthermia seen at 28 oC is due to activation of BAT and the subsequent inability of the animal to lose the excess heat due to cutaneous vasoconstriction produced by d-fenfluramine at 28 <b>degrees</b> <b>Centigrade...</b>|$|R

These materials {{are used in}} many applications such as disposal medical devices, structural bonds, bone cement, prostheses, etc [...] In order to use these materials in medicine applications, the thermal properties of these materials should be evaluated. We measured the thermal properties of the adhesive which has been modified with Hycar rubber. It is found that increasing in Hycar leads to decrease in thermal properties of adhesive.
