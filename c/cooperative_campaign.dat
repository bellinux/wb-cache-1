5|$|Fall of Cybertron {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. Critics generally {{felt that the}} game was true to the Transformers franchise and provided good fan service, but some thought that the story pace slowed at times. Gameplay was mostly praised, but some reviewers cited the removal of War for Cybertrons <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign</b> as a low point. Graphics and audio also received broadly positive comments, though some reviewers noticed frame rate issues with the PlayStation 3 version. A tie-in titled , which is partially set between War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron was released June 24, 2014.|$|E
5|$|X-Men Legends {{is played}} as an action {{role-playing}} game. Players choose {{a team of}} up to four characters from a larger group of X-Men. As players proceed through the game additional X-Men are unlocked. On the console versions up to four players can play in the <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign,</b> {{with the ability to}} add or remove players at any time. Cooperative play features a refined combat system and the ability to interact with non-player characters. The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or against waves of computer-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|Every {{character}} {{has been given}} their own unique ability. For example, Jazz can fire a grappling hook to reach high or distant places, Optimus Prime can command the massive Metroplex, and the Combaticons {{have the ability to}} combine into the Decepticon Bruticus. Segments in which players control Bruticus are designed to accommodate its larger size. Scale is maintained so the character towers over enemies. The Autobot Grimlock, who transforms into a dinosaur, is controlled differently than other characters. Carrying only a sword and shield, Grimlock cannot transform at will, instead accumulating rage as he battles opponents. When he gains enough rage, Grimlock is able to transform and inflict massive damage. The online <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign</b> play featured in the first game has been removed in favor of levels that utilize each character's specific abilities.|$|E

50|$|Portal 2s lead writer Erik Wolpaw {{estimates}} each {{campaign to}} be about six hours long. Portal 2 contains in-game commentary from the game developers, writers, and artists. The commentary, accessible after completing the game once, appears on node icons scattered through the chambers.According to Valve, each of the single-player and <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaigns</b> is 2 to 2.5 times {{as long as the}} campaign in Portal, with the overall game five times as long.|$|R
5|$|Portal 2 is a first-person {{perspective}} puzzle game. The Player {{takes the}} role of Chell in the single-player campaign, as one of two robotsAtlas and P-Bodyin the <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign,</b> or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community-developed puzzles. These four characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent checkpoint; in the cooperative game, the robot respawns shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle. The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture Science Laboratory—a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.|$|E
5|$|The {{cooperative}} gameplay {{originated from}} players' requests and from anecdotes of players {{working together on}} the same computer or console to solve the game's puzzles. Wolpaw likened this to players working together on the same computer to solve point-and-click adventure games. The <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign</b> was also inspired by Valve's Left 4 Dead cooperative games, in which players enjoyed discussing their personal experiences with the game when they had finished playing it. While the single player campaign in Portal 2 is designed to avoid frustrating the player, the cooperative levels focus on coordination and communication, and Valve recognizes {{they are much more}} difficult than the single-player puzzles. Valve did not include timed puzzles in the single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, but found that their inclusion in the cooperative mode is effective and gives players a positive feeling after they successfully plan and execute difficult maneuvers. Each puzzle chamber in the cooperative mode requires four portals to solve to prevent puzzles being solved by the actions of only one player. As soon as a playtester discovered a way to complete a puzzle with one set of portals, the level was sent back to the designers for further work. Except in a few cases, Valve designed the chambers so that both players would remain in sight of each other to promote communication and cooperation. Some of the puzzle chambers were designed asymmetrically; one player would manipulate portals and controls to allow the other player to cross the room, emphasizing that the two characters, while working together, are separate entities. The designers soon realized that the ability to tag surfaces with instructional icons for one's partner was a necessary element, since they found this to be more effective for cooperation than simple, verbal instructions.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} Shank is told in two parts, single-player campaign, and a <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign,</b> {{which serves as}} a prelude to the former.

Asia Pacific Regional Geodetic Project (APRGP), as a regional campaign, has promoted annual observations mainly by GPS to densify the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). To construct an ITRF based frame, not only positions but also velocities are necessary. Nevertheless, establishing a velocity field in the region has not been achived yet. In this paper, we estimate a velocity field, using GPS data obtained from 1998 to 2001 campaings. The result shows an excellent agreement with the plate model...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{capabilities}} of measuring wind profiles in the troposphere and stratosphere with {{good time and}} height resolution, whatever the weather conditions, stratosphere-troposphere (ST) radars are well adapted to carry out atmospheric research in many fields {{as well as to}} fulfill the meteorological forecasting needs. Examples are presented from previous and future national or international campaigns planned in France. The ST radars were used first by themselves with the adjunction of radiosonde data. Then networks were built and used to get horizontal parameters. It appears that ST radar networks should naturally be included in <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaigns...</b>|$|R
25|$|Shank {{features}} a <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign</b> {{designed to be}} played locally, which is a prequel to the single-player campaign. The multiplayer allows players to play as Shank and his partner-in-crime named Falcone. In this mode players are often required {{to work as a}} team to accomplish objectives, such as defeating level bosses. Players can combine moves for special attacks with the characters perform together. Also available is the ability to revive a fallen teammate should they die in combat.|$|E
25|$|The <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign</b> {{begins with}} Shank and fellow hitman Falcone (voiced by Gavin Cummins) {{as they head}} to Cassandra's (voiced by Sheila Goold) strip club, which has been overrun by a biker gang. As they arrive she is kidnapped by the biker leaders. Shank and Falcone chase them to a back alley and kill one, leaving the other for Cassandra. The pair then head to a wrestling match that their mob boss Cesar had rigged. The Butcher (voiced by Dave White) was {{supposed}} to lose the fight, but the wrestler instead decides to defeat his opponent. Shank and Falcone are ordered to teach the Butcher a lesson. Later, Cesar phones the two hitmen and asks them to go and oppose a priest {{and the members of}} his congregation. They succeed in kidnapping the priest, Father Gomez (voiced by Steve Lange), taking him to Cesar (voiced by Dave White) and his cousin Angelo (voiced by Tim Gouran). Angelo shoots the priest in the face, much to Shank's disapproval; he then dons the dead priest's garments and takes his place {{in order to make the}} murder go undetected.|$|E
25|$|Left 4 Dead {{contains}} four game modes: campaign, versus, survival, and single-player. The <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign</b> {{consists of}} up to four human-controlled survivors who attempt {{to make their way}} between safe rooms and eventually to rescue. In this mode, the special infected are controlled by the AI. In a versus campaign, each team of one to four players plays each chapter of the campaign as both survivor and infected, swapping sides once per chapter. Unlike campaign mode, dead survivors do not respawn. If at least one player-controlled survivor finishes the level, the survivor team earns 100 points as well as bonus points based on their health and the health items in their inventory. These points are then multiplied by the chapter's difficulty level, and the number of survivors who finished. If all player-controlled survivors are killed, the survivor team only earns points according to their average progress through the chapter and the difficulty multiplier. Survival mode consists of a timed challenge where players try to survive as long as possible against a never-ending flood of the infected, added in April 2009 in the Survival Pack downloadable content. Single-player mode is similar to campaign mode, but played offline with three AI-controlled bots as the other survivors. On Xbox 360, other players can join in on the same console to turn single player into an offline co-op game. The game can also be played through a system link, or local area network. Players have also discovered a way to do splitscreen co-op play with the PC version.|$|E

500|$|Valve {{planned to}} produce {{downloadable}} content for Portal 2, beginning with [...] "Peer Review", released on October 4, 2011. The content, which is free regardless of platform, includes a new <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign</b> which extends the game's story.

[...] The content also adds a [...] "challenge mode" [...] similar to that in Portal—players try to complete specific chambers with the shortest time or fewest number of portals used, both which are tracked on overall and friends leaderboards. The challenge modes are available for both single-player and cooperative modes.|$|E
500|$|Portal 2 {{includes}} bonus content, {{including four}} promotional videos, a Lab Rat comic, and an interactive trailer for the 2011 film Super 8, constructed with the Source game engine.

500|$|In a more {{critical}} review, Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann {{felt that the}} game had uneven pacing and gameplay. [...] "The highs in Transformers: Fall of Cybertron are very high [...] but it doesn't go far enough in that direction to stand out" [...] he stated. Gerstmann disliked the frame rate drops during heavy action sequences. IGN's Matt Cabral also noted this, but dismissed these moments as [...] "occasional hiccups". Cabral gave high marks for visual presentation, including the transformations each character used to change forms. Both Cabral and Keil criticized the lack of <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign</b> gameplay, a feature available in the game's predecessor, as a low point of Fall of Cybertron.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the practical contribution of a VHF radar to high time resolu-tion automatic temperature profiling both for research and operational applications in the frame of an integrated sys-tem of ground-based remote-sensing instruments. Based on the most prominent results already mentioned about this in-strumentation, different techniques, related to the tempera-ture data retrieval, are experimentally tested and documented using the INSU/Meteo 45 MHz wind profiler operating at CNRM/Toulouse or during <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaigns.</b> In par-allel to the self-sufficient Radio Acoustic Sounding Sys-tem (RASS), other approaches, using the Brunt-Vaisala fre-quency measurements, allow an extension of height coverage up to the higher troposphere and the tropopause. As only temperature gradients can be measured by this way, com-plementary data from other instruments are desirable. This makes it particularly fitted to an integrated remote-sensing system operating from the ground combining wind profilers with GPS, radiometers, lidar ceilometers and sodars...|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from new}} battles and missions, Balance of Power {{features}} a Rebel and an Imperial campaign of 15 missions each. The <b>campaigns</b> supported 8-player <b>cooperative</b> play. Both <b>campaigns</b> {{revolve around the}} same series of events, but with alternate endings.|$|R

In October 2015, a Halloween-themed [...] "capture point" [...] game mode was released, titled [...] "Colosseum". The move to the Source 2 engine in 2015 also saw the addition of community-created custom game modes, known as the [...] "Arcade", with the more popular ones having dedicated server hosting by Valve.

500|$|Erik Wolpaw, National Lampoon veteran Jay Pinkerton and Left 4 Dead writer Chet Faliszek {{wrote the}} game's script. Wolpaw and Pinkerton wrote the single-player {{campaign}} story, while Faliszek wrote GLaDOS's lines for the <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign.</b> The game has 13,000 lines of dialogue. The writers felt {{they needed to}} create a larger story for a stand-alone title, and wanted the game to [...] "feel relatively intimate", and avoided adding too many new characters. They considered expanding the [...] "sterility and dryness" [...] of Portal and adding more comedy to the script. Wolpaw said that while some developers have been moving towards art games, no one had made a comedic video game. The game's story development was tightly coordinated with the gameplay development and testing.|$|E

500|$|Single-player was {{generally}} considered a disappointment by critics, with Situations receiving mixed reviews. Carter {{described it as}} one of his [...] "favorite non-campaign additions" [...] as the mode gave players incentive to return due to its rating system. Butterworth described it as a [...] "surprisingly robust" [...] mode, and thought that there were great tutorial missions that help players to understand gameplay before trying multiplayer. However, Bertz criticized it for its lack of replay value, and Griffin noted their short length. McCaffery thought that it served as a competent tutorial, but its solo play nature meant that players could not practice teamplay and tactics. Davenport criticized the narrative in Situations, which he thought was not meaningful. Many critics were disappointed with the lack of a single-player campaign or a <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign,</b> but Butterworth believed that the strong multiplayer components can compensate for this absence. Gies noticed certain network issues would affect the single-player.|$|E
500|$|In the <b>cooperative</b> <b>campaign,</b> a {{separate}} story involves two robotic characters and GLaDOS. The designers initially {{planned to use}} Chell and a new human character called [...] "Mel". GLaDOS' dialogue would play off the humans' [...] "image issues", and this aspect was retained after the designers switched to using robots. GLaDOS seems troubled by the robots' cooperation, and tries to aggravate their relationship through psychological tactics, such as praising one robot over the other. Valve initially considered having GLaDOS deliver separate lines to each player, but they found {{this to be a}} significant effort for minimal benefit. The writers also tried adding lines for GLaDOS that would encourage the players to compete against each other for rewards, such as meaningless points, but playtesters did not respond well. Faliszek said that in cooperative games, {{it can be difficult to}} deliver key dialogue or in-game events to players, who may not be looking in the right direction at the right time. Instead, using their experience from previous games, Faliszek and Wolpaw kept the story and key comedic lines short, and repeated them frequently.|$|E

40|$|Television {{advertising}} {{of prescription}} drugs is controversial, and it remains illegal in all but two countries. Much of the opposition stems from concerns that advertising directly to consumers may ine-ciently distort prescribing patterns toward the advertised product. Despite the controversy surrounding the practice, its e ects are not well understood. Exploiting a policy change that makes such advertising possible in the United States along with a spatial identi cation at the border approach, I estimate that television advertising of prescription antidepressants exhibits signi cant positive spillovers on rivals' demand. I then construct and estimate a multi-stage demand model that allows advertising to be pure category expansion, pure business stealing or some of each. Estimated parameters indicate that advertising has strong market level demand e ects that tend to dominate business stealing e ects. Spillovers are both large and persistent.
