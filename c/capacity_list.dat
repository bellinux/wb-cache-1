40|$|Background: It is well {{documented}} that heat acclimation of 6 or more sessions of at least 60 min duration prolongs the time to exhaustion during endurance walking, cycling and running in the heat. However, this type of acclimation is not specific to team sport activity {{and the effect of}} acclimation on prolonged high intensity intermittent running has not yet been investigated. Objective: To assess the impact of an intermittent acclimation protocol on distance run during team sport activity. Methods: The impact of 4 short heat acclimation sessions (30 – 45 min of the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test; LIST) on high-intensity intermittent running <b>capacity</b> (<b>LIST)</b> in the heat (30 oC, 27 % RH), was examined. Seventeen female welltrained games players were split into 3 groups; an acclimation group (30 oC, 24 % RH), a moderate training group (18 oC, 41 % RH), and a control group who did not complete any training between the main trials (pre- and post-acclimation) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Inspired by cold boot attacks, Heninger and Shacham (Crypto 2009) {{initiated}} {{the study of}} {{the problem of how to}} recover an RSA private key from a noisy version of that key. They gave an algorithm for the case where some bits of the private key are known with certainty. Their ideas were extended by Henecka, May and Meurer (Crypto 2010) to produce an algorithm that works when all the key bits are subject to error. In this paper, we bring a coding-theoretic viewpoint to bear on the problem of noisy RSA key recovery. This viewpoint allows us to cast the previous work as part of a more general framework. In turn, this enables us to explain why the previous algorithms do not solve the motivating cold boot problem, and to design a new algorithm that does (and more). In addition, we are able to use concepts and tools from coding theory – channel <b>capacity,</b> <b>list</b> decoding algorithms, and random coding techniques – to derive bounds on the performance of the previous algorithms and our new algorithm...|$|E
