40|$|Background: The {{hospital}} {{industry has}} exhibited {{a pattern of}} isomorphic change with regard to business operations. Many states have enacted <b>community</b> benefit <b>laws</b> to compel hospitals to provide community benefits to improve their community orientation. Purposes: We seek to identify what kinds of isomorphic change might {{be associated with the}} enactment of these state <b>community</b> benefit <b>laws.</b> To do this, we conducted a longitudinal study of changes in community benefit provided by hospitals in both states with <b>community</b> benefit <b>laws</b> and states without <b>community</b> benefit <b>laws.</b> Methodology/Approach: This study used a quasi-experimental panel design with the passage of community benefit laws/guidelines as the treatment variable. Our sample was composed of 390 not-for-profit hospitals and 129 investor-owned hospitals in 9 treatment states and 1, 493 not-for-profit and 714 investor-owned hospitals in 35 control states. Community benefit was measured by the (a) community orientation activities reported and the (b) health promotion services offered by hospitals. Findings: The not-for-profit hospitals in the states without <b>community</b> benefit <b>laws</b> had increased their community orientation activities and health promotion services {{in a manner similar to}} that of the not-for-profit hospitals in the states with <b>community</b> benefit <b>laws.</b> There was no significant difference between the not-for-profit hospitals in the states without <b>community</b> benefit <b>laws</b> and those in the states with <b>community</b> benefit <b>laws</b> in 1994 or 2006 for either dependent variable. The changes in the community benefit for the not-for-profit hospitals in the states without <b>community</b> benefit <b>laws</b> and in the states with <b>community</b> benefit <b>laws</b> were significant and positive for both dependent variables. Practice Implications: Managers of acute care hospitals should engage in community orientation activities to maintain their legitimacy, differentiate themselves from other hospitals, avoid regulation, and manage resource dependency on managed-care payers...|$|R

40|$|Part I of {{this article}} reviews the legal {{landscape}} that provided the backdrop against which Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Pennsylvania later adopted <b>community</b> property <b>laws.</b> It also examines the tax consequences of the two Supreme Court cases, Lucas v. Earl and Poe v. Seaborn, {{that resulted in the}} disparate tax treatment of married couples in common <b>law</b> and <b>community</b> property <b>law</b> states. Part II briefly reviews the subsequent passage of <b>community</b> property <b>laws</b> by Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Pennsylvania; the passage of a federal tax reduction bill that provided for equal treatment of <b>community</b> property <b>law</b> and common law jurisdictions; and the subsequent history of those laws in each of the five states. The immediate repeal by Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Oregon of their <b>community</b> property <b>laws</b> following passage of the Revenue Act of 1948 suggests that the passage of the <b>community</b> property <b>laws</b> was simply a tax saving measure. This is the belief of some reputable scholars. This article does not refute that such laws were passed, in part, to achieve tax savings; however, it does suggest that other social forces were at work, as well. Part III {{of this article}} suggests that legislatures were able to pass <b>community</b> property <b>laws,</b> in part, because they gave {{little in the way of}} rights to wives, but went far, symbolically, in building married women 2 ̆ 7 s confidence that their household responsibilities were worth a portion of their husbands 2 ̆ 7 salaries. Such confidence was necessary if the pre-war social order, with women primarily in the home rather than the workforce, was going to be successfully reinstated after the war. This Part examines the social and cultural context in which a few states passed <b>community</b> property <b>laws</b> together with the legislative debate in Pennsylvania [...] the only state for which a substantive legislative history is available [...] over the passage of its <b>community</b> property <b>law.</b> Part IV concludes that although states passed <b>community</b> property <b>laws,</b> in part, for the tax benefits, more than money was involved...|$|R

25|$|The {{preceding}} Belaúnde {{administration had}} started Peru {{on the path}} of protection to promote industry, and in this respect the Velasco government reinforced rather than reversed the existing strategy. Beyond the usual recourse to high tariffs, Velasco's government adopted the Industrial <b>Community</b> <b>Law</b> of 1970 that gave any industrialist on the register of manufacturers the right to demand prohibition of any imports competing with his products. No questions of exceptionally high costs of production, poor product quality, or monopolistic positions fostered by excluding import competition were allowed to get in the way. Before the succeeding government of General Francisco Morales Bermúdez Cerrutti (1975–80) began to clean up the battery of protective exclusions in 1978, the average tariff rate reached 66 percent, accompanied by quantitative restrictions on 2,890 specific tariff positions.|$|E

25|$|During the 20th century, {{a belief}} arose that some extra {{protection}} of human rights above and beyond parliamentary scrutiny was necessary. Doubts grew about the capacity of parliamentary controls, partly because of scepticism about Parliament's will to control the growing executive and the control by political parties of their MPs which allowed weak governments to avoid effective challenges. This scepticism went {{hand in hand with}} criticisms of the United Kingdom's political system and whether it is sufficiently representative of the range of opinion in the country. The doubts intensified with the experiences with terrorism in the 1970s and accession to the European Community in 1973 where Britain was exposed to other legal systems which did not share the same concept of parliamentary sovereignty and which gave stronger protection to human rights. In particular, European entry led to the notion that the Parliament of the United Kingdom could be subject to the decisions of a higher legal order {{in the form of the}} European Court of Justice. This was highlighted in the Factortame litigation where the House of Lords was required to 'disapply' provisions of an Act of Parliament which were contrary to European <b>Community</b> <b>law,</b> effectively ruling them invalid. In addition, increasingly influenced by international human rights law, comparative constitutional law and European law, English courts became more sympathetic towards the concept of popular sovereignty and fundamental rights and liberties.|$|E
