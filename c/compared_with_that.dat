5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E
5|$|In {{reducing}} conditions, mendelevium(III) can {{be easily}} reduced to mendelevium(II), which is stable in aqueous solution. The standard reduction potential of the E°(Md3+→Md2+) couple was variously estimated in 1967 as −0.10V or −0.20V: later 2013 experiments established the value as /Md2+ Reduction Potential Studied with Flow Electrolytic Chromatography |journal=Inorganic Chemistry |volume=52 |issue=21 |pages=12311–3 |doi=10.1021/ic401571h}} In comparison, E°(Md3+→Md0) should be around −1.74V, and E°(Md2+→Md0) should be around −2.5V.

The net magnetic moment of an atom is equal to the vector sum of orbital and spin magnetic moments of all electrons and the nucleus.

Observation of the Earth's surface proved unproductive, however, because of heavy cloud cover and bad photographic exposures.

5|$|De Lucía {{was widely}} {{considered}} to be the world's premier flamenco guitarist and by many to be Spain's greatest musical export. He had a revolutionary influence on flamenco music both as a composer and otherwise. His influence on flamenco guitar has been <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of Andrés Segovia's on classical guitar. His album Fuente y Caudal (Fountain and Flow) has been cited by many to have changed the world of flamenco guitar beyond traditional flamenco culture. Along with Enrique Morente and Camarón de la Isla, de Lucía was the first artist to break away from traditional flamenco and form what is now known as nuevo flamenco. As a composer, de Lucía was the first Spanish artist to mix jazz with Andalusian music in a more or less systematic way. This includes, but is not limited to, his collaborations with Di Meola, McLaughlin, and Pedro Iturralde.|$|E
5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} family groups come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|E
5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving no information about whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo explore antischitosome {{effects of}} artemether, hemin and Fe 3 + on Sj LDH. MethodsEnzyme {{activity}} of rSj LDH was assayed {{in the standard}} reaction system by adding different concentration of reagents (0. 00 - 0. 10 mM artemether, 0. 00 - 0. 02 mM hemin, 0. 00 - 0. 50 mM Fe 3 +). Same solvents of the each reagent were used as control. ResultsThere was no enzyme activity inhibition observed at 0. 10 mM artemther; obivious inhibition for lactate oxidation reaction and pyruvate reduction reaction were detected at 0. 002 mM and 0. 004 mM of hemin, respectively; <b>comparing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of the control (P< 0. 05). The relative enzymatic activity inhibitions for pyruvate reduction reaction and lactate oxidation reaction at 0. 02 mM hemin were 93. 48 % and 100. 00 %, respectively, <b>comparing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of the control (P< 0. 01); both pyruvate reduction and lactate oxidation reaction were inhibited completely at 0. 50 mM Fe 3 +, <b>comparing</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of the control (P< 0. 01). ConclusionsThe results implied that Sj LDH was not the direct molecular target of artemether. Hemin and Fe 3 + are inhibitors of Sj LDH...|$|R

5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated nitric acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed nitric acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Obsessed {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics, {{many of whom}} were disappointed {{in the absence of an}} explanation for Lisa's obsession with Derek. Others noted that the potential theme of interracial conflict between the Charles family, who are black, and Lisa, who is white, was unexplored. The storyline of Obsessed has been <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> of Fatal Attraction (1987) - a recollection in which Elba and Beyoncé have the Michael Douglas and Anne Archer roles, respectively, while Larter is in Glenn Close's - although film critics disliked the fact that Derek did not yield to Lisa's seduction. The fight scene finale between Sharon and Lisa, however, was commended by reviewers, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight. Obsessed spent its first week atop the US box office, and grossed $73.8million from theaters, internationally. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film for home viewing on August4,2009, in the US and has sold 1.3million DVDs, worth $21million of consumer spending.|$|E
