40|$|This article argues that, {{by acting}} {{autonomously}} and cohesively, the European Union (EU) {{was able to}} shape the global agenda on foreign aid throughout the 2000 s, particularly {{on the issue of}} donor complementarity and division of labour. By contrast, its ability to promote aid effectiveness in Sub-Saharan Africa was significantly constrained by <b>national</b> <b>aid</b> bureaucracies and by the complex aid architecture. More generally, to fully understand whether or not the EU is an effective actor, it is necessary to take into account how EU actorness contributes to the issue being discussed. At headquarter level, the European Commission sought to enhance EU actorness, which was seen as key to aid effectiveness. On the ground, <b>national</b> <b>aid</b> bureaucracies resisted EU actorness in the name of aid effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|ACES aims {{to develop}} {{realistic}} supercomputer simulation {{models for the}} com-plete earthquake generation process and to assimilate observations into such models. This capability provides a powerful "virtual laboratory " to probe earth-quake behaviour and the earthquake cycle. Hence, it offers a new opportunity to gain {{the understanding of the}} earthquake nucleation process, precursory phe-nomena, and space-time seismicity patterns needed for breakthrough advances in earthquake forecasting and hazard quantification. The simulation approach can be compared to that of the successful Global Climate Models that are used to understand and predict long-term climatic conditions. The project represents a grand scientific challenge because of the complexity of phenomena and range of scales from microscopic to global involved in the earthquake generation process. It is a coordinated international effort linking <b>complementary</b> <b>national</b> programs, centres and research teams. Objectives • To develop realistic numerical simulation models for the physics and dynamics of the com-plete earthquake generation process and to assimilate new earthquake observations into such models, • to foster collaboration between the relevant <b>complementary</b> <b>national</b> programs of participat-ing member economies, and • to foster development of the required research infrastructure and research programs...|$|R
