5|$|Cucurbitacin is a plant steroid {{present in}} wild Cucurbita {{and in each}} member of the family Cucurbitaceae. Poisonous to mammals, it is found in {{quantities}} sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild Cucurbita and most ornamental gourds, with the exception of an occasional C.fraterna and C.sororia, bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent in wild Cucurbita; in parts of Mexico the flesh of the fruits is rubbed on a woman's breast to wean <b>children.</b> <b>While</b> the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as a lure in insect traps.|$|E
