Patients and methods: This retrospective cohort study evaluated a program that was implemented in 76 national community pharmacies located in the midwest USA. It consisted of two face-to-face patient counseling sessions with a pharmacist that addressed patient barriers to adherence. A group of 2056 NTT statin patients was identified between September 1, 2010 and October 31, 2010, and was followed for 12 months. The intervention group consisted of 586 patients, and the comparison group comprised 516 patients. Outcomes were measured using the <b>continuous</b> medication <b>possession</b> ratio (MPR), categorical MPR, and medication persistency. Results: After adjusting for covariates, the intervention group had statistically greater MPR than the comparison group at every month measured. For example, at 12 months the intervention group had a MPR of 61. 8 % (CI, 54. 5 %&ndash; 69. 2 %) and the comparison group had a MPR of 56. 9 % (CI, 49. 5 %&ndash; 64. 3 %); this 4. 9 % difference is significant (P &lt; 0. 01). The 12 month categorical MPR also showed significant differences between groups (&chi; 2 = 6. 12, P &lt; 0. 05); 40. 9 % of the intervention group and 33. 7 % of comparison group had a MPR {{greater than or equal to}} 80 %. Finally, the intervention group had significantly greater persistency with their medication therapy than the comparison group at 60, 90, 120, and 365 days. Conclusion: Patients who participated in brief face-to-face counseling sessions with a community pharmacist at the beginning of statin therapy demonstrated greater medication adherence and persistency than a comparison group. This brief targeted intervention at the initiation of maintenance drug therapy moderates the high risk of nonadherence and discontinuation; it helps patients establish a routine of daily self-medication and potentially improves their long-term clinical outcomes.

5000|$|In common law, {{through the}} legally {{recognized}} concept of adverse possession, a squatter {{can become a}} bona fide owner of property without compensation to the former owner. Adverse possession is {{the process by which}} one acquires the title to a piece of land by occupying it for the number of years necessary, dictated differently in practice by each state's statute of limitation for an eviction action. A necessary component of this transfer of ownership requires that the landowner is aware (or should be aware) of the land occupation [...] and that he or she does nothing {{to put an end to}} it. If the land use by the new occupant goes unchecked for the said number of years, the new occupant can claim legal rights to the land. The occupant must show that the [...] "possession is actual, open, notorious, exclusive, hostile, under cover of claim or right, and continuous and uninterrupted for the statutory period." [...] As Erin Wiegand notes, the most difficult part of claiming adverse possession on the part of squatters is the [...] "continuous" [...] part. Squatting is a very transient lifestyle and many people are evicted on a frequent basis. In an article regarding recent foreclosures in the United States, a current squatter in Miami stated of her housing, [...] "It's a beautiful castle and it's temporary for me, if I can be here twenty-four hours, I'm thankful."

50|$|Having three downs on a {{much longer}} and wider field with {{unlimited}} backfield motion results in Canadian teams requiring faster, more nimble athletes (comparatively) than their American counterparts. Paradoxically, this makes Canadian defense better at defending rushing plays. Rushing plays tend to be unlikely to produce a full ten yard gain, and if correctly anticipated by the defense, much gain at all. The fewer downs means that an unsuccessful rushing play leaves an offense to have a single play to make comparatively longer first down yardage, so rushing plays are less-favored unless the team on offense is actively managing the clock while maintaining the lead. Pundits often like to claim that a Canadian team that rushes for 100 yards or more per game is likely to win, {{but the reality is}} winning teams rush the ball in defense of their leads, and not as a tactic to produce drives that lead to points unless they are markedly superior to their opponents. The larger field generally permits greater YAC (yards after catch) on each individual catch, where the NFL produces passing plays where there are either very few YAC yards (immediate tackle) or huge YAC yards (missed tackle or broken coverage for huge gains.) For this reason, Canadian teams usually prefer passing over rushing {{to a greater extent than}} American, since pass attempts generally tend to gain more yards than rushing. Offensive drives (<b>continuous</b> <b>possession</b> of the ball) tend to be shorter. Long drives of half a quarter or more are common in American football but rare in Canadian.In theory, an NFL team taking possession on their own one-yard line, using three downs for each first-down conversion and the full 40 second clock could run 27 plays and consume a full 18 minutes of clock time covering the 99 yards. A CFL team doing something similar (two plays per conversion, 20 second clock, average 10 seconds of clock time while the officials reset the ball between plays, 109 yards) would run 24 plays and consume 12 minutes of clock at the most. Typical drive lengths in practice reflect this theoretical difference.|$|E

40|$|The Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP) Prisoners Books for 1905 - 1908 and 1911 - 1918 are {{amongst the}} most {{valuable}} new documents to come to light on the revolutionary decade. They include important information on social and political life in the capital during {{the last years of}} the Union, from the period of widespread anticipation of Home Rule, to the advent of the 1913 Lockout, the outbreak of the First World War, the Easter Rising and its aftermath, including the conscription crisis of 1918. They will also be invaluable to those interested in criminology, genealogy, and family history. Scope and content: The collection comprises of four large leather bound, double ledger volumes containing hand written entries that record the details of daily charge sheets issued by DMP members to offenders or alleged offenders. Each volume contains the name, age, address, occupation, alleged offence and, in most cases, outcome of cases involving over 30, 000 people arrested by the DMP. Each volume also contains an index of prisoners with references to the pages containing details of the charge. Scope and content: Three of the four volumes bear the title “Prisoners Book” and each page of arrest records has the running title “Prisoners charged with offences involving dishonesty”. Three of the volumes are numbered on the spine - the first volume in the collection as 1, the third as 4, and the fourth as 5. The third volume in the collection is missing the number on the spine, but as the entries in this volume are dated immediately before those in book number 4, it has been assumed that this volume was numbered as 3. There is a gap in the dates between the volume numbered as 1 and this volume, so it is assumed that there was a volume number 2. It is unknown whether this volume survives. Volume 1 records all those arrested from April 1 st 1905 to January 1 st 1908. The second volume (assumed to be number 3) runs from January 1 st 1911 to September 30 th 1913. Volume 4 contains the entries from October 1 st 1913 to 31 st December 1915. Volume 5 records the arrests from January 1 st 1916 to September 30 th 1918. Biographical/historical information: The Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP) was established in 1836, along with the Irish Constabulary (later {{to be known as the}} Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC)). The DMP and the RIC replaced the County Constabulary, a uniformed police force formed on a regional basis. Following the War of Independence and the truce of July 1921, the RIC disbanded and a new police force, “The Civic Guard” (renamed the Garda Síochána na hÉireann on 8 August 1923) was formed. The DMP merged with An Garda Síochána in 1925. There were 20 DMP stations located in Dublin City and the southern townships (most of County Dublin fell within the remit of the Royal Irish Constabulary). They were Blackrock, the Bridewell, Chancery Lane, Clarendon Street, Clontarf, College Street, Dalkey, Donnybrook, Fitzgibbon Street, Irishtown, Kevin Street, Kill O the Grange, Kilmainham, Kingstown, Lad Lane, Mountjoy, Newmarket, Rathmines, Store Street and Terenure. It is thought that the station sergeant in the Bridewell, which adjoined the Police Magistrates’ Courts, was responsible for collating the records from all the DMP stations. The alleged crimes detailed in the records range from murder to robbing sweet machines, and those arrested range in age from eight to 80. The passing of the Defence of the Realm Act (DORA) on August 8 th 1914 created an important new series of offences that were used increasingly against political activists. Biographical/historical information: Besides describing the type of offences committed, whether ordinary or political crimes, the collection tells us a great deal about the type of people arrested, their gender balance, social problems in the city, sentencing policies of the Police Magistrates, and how events such as the 1913 Lockout and Easter Rising affected different groups in the community. For instance, these records confirm that the majority of people arrested during the 1913 Lockout were workers rather than “the foul reserves of the slums” as alleged by the Irish Catholic and other newspapers owned by William Martin Murphy. They also show a sharp rise in arrests of deserters and absentees from the British armed forces once the First World War broke out, a problem ignored in practically every account of the period. On the other hand, the large scale arrests of women in the aftermath of the Easter Rising for looting in the city centre do conform to the traditional narrative and correlate to areas of the city with widespread deprivation. The increasing incidence of public order offences and arrests under DORA from 1916 onwards often depict people not traditionally associated with criminal behaviour but more representative of the wider community, while the rising incidence of juvenile crime is a common feature across cities in wartime Europe. The information in these volumes serves, therefore, to provide new perspectives on life in Dublin during a time of war and revolution. Ownership/custodial history: Volume number 4, covering the latter end of 1913 to the end of 1915, has been in the <b>continuous</b> <b>possession</b> of the DMP and then the Garda Museum and Archives. The other three volumes were probably discarded when the DMP was abolished in 1924 and were held by a private individual or individuals, before being discarded again in 2015. They were retrieved in the north Dublin inner city by a group of community activists who contacted author, journalist, and trade union activist Pádraig Yeates, through Michael Finn, a retired Detective Superintendent of the Garda Síochána. Pádraig Yeates arranged, with the permission of the group, to have all the volumes digitised by Eneclann. The group subsequently agreed to hand the volumes over to SIPTU on two conditions: one was that a donation be made to support a local youth project, and the second was that the information contained in them would go online, free to the public. SIPTU agreed to make a substantial donation to the project and UCD Library undertook to provide an open access, online digital publishing platform for the volumes. Acquisition details: SIPTU provided three volumes to UCD Library, already digitised. UCD Library then digitised the volume for 1913 to 1915, held by the Garda Museum and Archives. On completion of the work, SIPTU presented the volumes in its possession to the Garda Museum and Archives. Location of original: All four volumes in this collection are now held by the Garda Museum and Archives...|$|E
