40|$|To improve immunoassays {{of small}} haptens, we {{developed}} two different approaches for their measurement in a non-competitive format. We first devised two-site llnmunomet-nc assays for small peptides (8 - 11 amino acids) by selecting {{two sets of}} antibodies specifically directed against C- and N-terminal moieties of the peptides.

40|$|AbstractA {{fluorescent}} <b>competitive</b> <b>assay</b> for melamine {{was first}} developed utilizing dummy molecularly imprinted polymers (DMIPs) as artificial antibodies. This method {{is based on}} the competition between fluorescent substances and the unlabeled analyte for binding sites in synthesized DMIPs and the decreased binding of fluorescent substances to DMIPs due to increased concentrations of melamine in the solutions. DMIPs for melamine were synthesized under a hot water bath {{in the presence of the}} initiator azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) using 2, 4 -diamino- 6 -methyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine (DAMT) as a dummy template, methacrylic acid (MAA) as a functional monomer, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as a crosslinking agent. The adsorption capacity and selectivity of DMIPs for melamine were evaluated by the isothermal adsorption curve and Scatchard analysis. The evaluation results showed that the synthesized DMIPs had specific recognition sites for melamine and the maximum adsorption amount was 1 066. 33 μg g− 1. Later, 5 -(4, 6 -dichlorotriazinyl) amino fluorescein (DTAF) with a triazine ring, which slightly resembles melamine, was selected as the fluorescent substance. The fluorescent <b>competitive</b> <b>assay</b> using DMIPs as the antibody mimics was finally established by selecting and optimizing the reaction solvents, DMIPs amount, DTAF concentration, and incubation time. The optimal detection system showed a linear response within range of 0. 05 – 40 mg L− 1 and the limit of detection (LOD) was 1. 23 μg L− 1. It was successfully applied to the detection of melamine in spiked milk samples with satisfactory recoveries (71. 9 to 86. 3 %).

40|$|Quantitation of {{biological}} affinity reactions by a newly developed chemically amplified electrochemical detection method was demonstrated with the biotin-avidin binding pair. In the method, ruthenium tris(2, 2 &# 39;-bipyridine) (Ru-bipy) {{was used as}} an electrochemical signal-generating tag. Its oxidation current on an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode was amplified with a sacrificial electron donor, oxalate. Because oxalate itself produced negligible current on the electrode, the signal-to-background ratio was greatly enhanced in comparison with other chemical amplification systems. Although the Ru-bipy/oxalate redox couple has been employed previously in electrochemiluminescent and photoelectrochemical detection, its use in a catalytic amperometric detection {{of biological}} binding assays has not been reported. To implement the method in the detection of biotin-avidin recognition, avidin was immobilized on an ITO electrode, and was reacted with biotin in solution. Immobilization of avidin by passive adsorption was found to be relatively stable under the condition of the affinity reaction. In the direct assay, biotin labelled with Ru-bipy was recognized by avidin and accumulated on the electrode surface, which was then detected electrochemically in the presence of oxalate. A linear relationship between electrochemical current and biotin concentration was obtained in the range of 1 - 300 ng mL(- 1). In the <b>competitive</b> <b>assay,</b> a mixed solution of unlabelled biotin (the analyte) of various concentrations and 100 ng mL(- 1) labelled biotin was reacted with avidin on the surface. As the concentration of the unlabelled biotin increased, less labelled biotin bound to avidin, leading to a reduction in the electro-catalytical response of Ru-bipy.

Monitoring systems capable of unattended and automated operation are desirable e. g. at pumping sites. In this paper {{we report on}} {{a study of the}} application of immunoanalytical techniques for flexible and automated multiresidue testing. A solid phase fluorescence immunoassay with immobilised analyte derivate and free, florescence labelled antibody is used. Two optical transducers were tested: A simple 'slab'-waveguide made of sheet glass and an integrated optical (IO) waveguide. Bulk fluorophore excitation was used to estimate the performance of each transducer. Both transducers allow an antibody surface coverage of less than 1 % of a monolayer of protein to be detected. The direct and covalent immobilisation of analyte derivates at the transducer surface for a binding inhibition assay approach is compared to a <b>competitive</b> <b>assay</b> with immobilisation of analyte derivates via an auxiliary antibody conjugate. The use of this auxiliary system allows the testing of different analytes at the same transducer surface. Atrazine was selected as a model analyte for the first trials. The ELISA type assay gives a test midpoint at 2. 2 µg/l and an estimated limit of detection of 0. 3 µg/l. The fluoroimmunoprobe with a binding inhibition assay has a test midpoint for atrazine at about 6 µg/l.
