Two species of <b>tegu</b> <b>lizards,</b> the black-and-white <b>tegu</b> (Tupinambis merianae) and the red tegu (T. rufescens), are hunted for their skins to supply the exotic leather trade. <b>Tegu</b> <b>lizards</b> were among the most exploited reptiles in the world. During the 1980 s, the annual harvest averaged 1. 9 million skins, and current quotas for Argentina and Paraguay are 1 million and 300, 000, respectively. Commercial trade in Tupinambis is legal in these countries, and management programs require monitoring the harvest. Skins are traded according to width: class 1 (> 30 cm), class 2 (> 25 - 29 cm), class 3 (< 24 cm). Management guidelines consist of the national export quota, and a ban on commerce of class 3 skins, aimed at reducing the number of subadults harvested. I studied the tegu management and monitoring program in Paraguay. I recorded snout-vent length (SVL), width, sex, and species from skins measured at check stations and in tanneries from 1991 to 1998. Comparison among field sites and tanneries allowed me to evaluate efficiency of the management guidelines and analyze harvest trends. Analyses of 8 seasons of harvest data showed a statistically significant, but slight, increase in SVL, and an increase in the proportion of males harvested for both species. The sex ratio (M: F) of harvested black-and-white tegus and red tegus varied in different years, but was generally biased toward more males. Corresponding to the general increase in skin size, the proportion of subadults in the harvest decreased during the sampling period. For black-and-white tegus, skins < 24 cm wide occurred in a higher proportion at check stations than in tanneries, presumably due to re-stretching of the skins by middlemen. Results indicate that <b>tegu</b> <b>lizards</b> are withstanding the harvest in Paraguay. There is no indication of overharvest, and no indicators of population decline. However, more field studies are needed to obtain data on hunting effort, and {{to assess the impact of}} the harvest at regional levels. Recommendations to improve the management program include the creation of a special committee involving governmental and non-governmental agencies and organizations related to the tegu trade and conservation of renewable resources...|$|R

40|$|Ectotherm antipredator {{behaviour}} {{might be}} strongly affected both by body temperature and size: when environmental temperatures do not favour maximal locomotor performance, large individuals may confront predators, whereas small animals may flee, {{simply because they}} have no other option. However, integration of body size and temperature effects is rarely approached in the study of antipredator behaviour in vertebrate ectotherms. in the present study we investigated whether temperature affects antipredator responses of <b>tegu</b> <b>lizards,</b> Tupinambis merianae, with distinct body sizes, testing the hypothesis that small tegus (juveniles) run away from predators regardless of the environmental temperature, because defensive aggression may not be an effective predator deterrent, whereas adults, which are larger, use aggressive defence at low temperatures, when running performance might be suboptimal. We recorded responses of juvenile (small) and adult (large) <b>tegu</b> <b>lizards</b> to a simulated predatory attack at five environmental temperatures in the laboratory. Most differences between the two size classes were observed at low temperatures: large tegus were more aggressive overall than were small tegus at all temperatures tested, but at lower temperatures, the small lizards often used escape responses whereas the large ones either adopted a defensive posture or remained inactive. These results provide strong evidence that body size and temperature affect the antipredator responses of vertebrate ectotherms. We discuss the complex and intricate network of evolutionary and ecological parameters that are likely {{to be involved in the}} evolution of such interactions.

2500|$|All {{reptiles}} breathe using lungs. Aquatic turtles {{have developed}} more permeable skin, and some species have modified their cloaca {{to increase the}} area for gas exchange. Even with these adaptations, breathing is never fully accomplished without lungs. Lung ventilation is accomplished differently in each main reptile group. In squamates, the lungs are ventilated almost exclusively by the axial musculature. This is also the same musculature that is used during locomotion. Because of this constraint, most squamates are forced to hold their breath during intense runs. Some, however, {{have found a way}} around it. Varanids, and a few other lizard species, employ buccal pumping as a complement to their normal [...] "axial breathing". This allows the animals to completely fill their lungs during intense locomotion, and thus remain aerobically active for a long time. <b>Tegu</b> <b>lizards</b> are known to possess a proto-diaphragm, which separates the pulmonary cavity from the visceral cavity. While not actually capable of movement, it does allow for greater lung inflation, by taking the weight of the viscera off the lungs.|$|R
40|$|With {{some notable}} exceptions, small ectothermic {{vertebrates}} {{are incapable of}} endogenously sustaining a body temperature substantially above ambient temperature. This view was challenged by our observations of nighttime body temperatures sustained well above ambient (up to 10 °C) during the reproductive season in <b>tegu</b> <b>lizards</b> (~ 2 kg). This led us to hypothesize that tegus have an enhanced capacity to augment heat production and heat conservation. Increased metabolic rates and decreased thermal conductance are the same mechanisms involved in body temperature regulation in those vertebrates traditionally acknowledged as “true endotherms” : the birds and mammals. The appreciation that a modern ectotherm {{the size of the}} earliest mammals can sustain an elevated body temperature through metabolic rates approaching that of endotherms enlightens the debate over endothermy origins, providing support for the parental care model of endothermy, but not for the assimilation capacity model of endothermy. It also indicates that, contrary to prevailing notions, ectotherms can engage in facultative endothermy, providing a physiological analog in the evolutionary transition to true endothermy...|$|R
