Today grid research is mostly focus on the communication, security, resource manangement and information management. <b>Charging</b> and <b>accounting</b> is a base activity in a economy society, so that it should {{become a part of}} grid computing system in computational economy environment. In this paper, we introduce <b>charging</b> and <b>accounting</b> item in a grid computing system, and propose a method for calculating the cost of a grid usage. This method gives out how to calculate the standardization technology cost of the usage of a job and how to translate the standardization technology cost into currency cost. Further more, we analyse the demands of a <b>charging</b> and <b>accounting</b> system in a computional economy based grid. A architecture of <b>charging</b> and <b>accounting</b> system and its support system is designed in this paper. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Charging</b> and <b>accounting</b> of Internet {{services}} has been addressed in numerous proposals. However, finding a solution suitable for ATM-based IP multicast services is highly challenging. IP multicast over ATM introduces high complexity, in particular for multicast with heterogeneous QoS and separate administrative IP domains by involvement of multiple Internet service providers. This paper proposes {{a framework for}} charging of IP multicast over ATM that is suitable for heterogeneous scenarios with multiple interconnected IP service providers and non-negligible losses. A scheme for ATM-based IP multicast transmission of wavelet -encoded video is presented that uses multiple ATM service classes. The scheme supports multicast scenarios with heterogeneous QoS and allows to trade off video quality, error tolerance, end-to-end delay and costs. 1. <b>Charging</b> and <b>Accounting</b> <b>Charging</b> and <b>accounting</b> of IP services gain more and more interest as the Internet is moving from an academic to a commerciall [...] ...|$|R

Current <b>charging</b> and <b>accounting</b> schemes primarily involve users being charged flat or based on the connection/session time. Accounting management of web services should provide for metering, <b>charging,</b> <b>accounting,</b> billing, payment and auditing. We have extended our earlier work, a Policy based Accounting for Web Services (WS-PACT), to develop a generic and comprehensive charging policy that can cater to different charging patterns. WS-PACT provides a flexible model to meet the varying billing and payment needs of service providers. Approach: Policies are expressed in WS-Policy and policy query facility has been developed using XQuery. Results: Users can use the query facility to obtain the charges being levied and can decide on which services to use by taking into account their preferred spending limits and payment patterns.
