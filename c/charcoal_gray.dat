25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design.

Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim.

2500|$|Phase III is {{a widely}} known paint scheme of Amtrak, {{introduced}} in 1976 on the Rohr Turboliners and existing to this day on some equipment. The [...] "classic" [...] version of this scheme used the same red and blue colors as previous schemes. [...] Most equipment was stainless steel or painted Platinum Mist (silver), and featured 8" [...] tall stripes of red white and blue. [...] Superliners, Amfleet and some Horizon cars had taller red and blue stripes, but the center white stripe remained at 8" [...] tall. Many variations exist within this scheme, including trainsets painted white with the stripes toward {{the bottom of the}} carbody, which was also featured on LRC equipment. Locomotives were painted with a black roof that normally angled down and over the cab windows and {{across the top of the}} nose. AEM-7 locomotives in Phase III wore a hybrid that was styled after the trainset variant but used Platinum Mist for the main body color. Dash 8-32BWH locomotives had a unique variant that was unofficially dubbed [...] "Pepsi paint." [...] The roof was painted <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Gray</b> and the stripes were enlarged and stylized with white pinstripes accenting their edges. The red and blue colors were changed to be darker and closer to US Flag colors. Genesis series locomotives were delivered using the same <b>Charcoal</b> <b>Gray</b> for the top, and the same darker red and blue color for their stripes.|$|E

5000|$|The unit emblem was {{designed}} by former superintendent Malcolm Haines prior to 1973.> It is composed of crossed M1 Garand rifles with fixed bayonets silhouetted over a silver/gray Roman helmet adorned with a scarlet red horsehair festoon on a field of ultramarine blue with the attached organization motto. The Roman helmet is symbolic of the Praetorian Guard of the Roman Empire---the original Honor Guard of the Western World---whose duty it was to protect the reigning emperor. The red festoon denotes courage and valor. The silver/gray of the helmet proper represents the excellence expected of all USAF HG personnel. The crossed M1 rifles historically denote the unit's primary weapon (the M14 rifle became the unit's primary weapon in 2002; however the Drill Team still continues to use the M1). The ultramarine blue background symbolizes the primary theater of Air Force operations - the sky and beyond. The attached motto, [...] "To Honor With Dignity" [...] best describes the unit's elite mission. The emblem {{is the centerpiece of}} the Air Force Honor Guard Badge, functional badges, that are worn by USAF HG personnel as well as Base Honor Guard members with slight differences between the two. Historically, the purpose of a guidon was to mark the position of a particular unit on the battlefield. Today, its function is to represent a particular unit during ceremonies. The USAF HG guidon is unique in comparison to other Air Force squadron guidons in that it is two-toned rather than one solid color. In 2000, Technical Sergeant Timothy Carney was tasked by Captain Leo Lawson, then-officer-in-charge of Ceremonial Flight, to develop a design for a guidon that would distinctly represent the USAF HG during ceremonies. The design is derived from the U.S. Army cavalry guidon of the 19th century. The blue and silver-white of the guidon represent the Air Force's colors---blue for the sky and silver-white for clouds and striking power in the medium of the air. The eagle represents the American eagle while the words [...] "USAF Honor Guard" [...] are self-explanatory.The emblem of the Colors element, created in 2000, incorporates the spade-shaped finial (commonly called the warhead) as well as other symbols associated with the Colors element. Their motto is [...] "Leading the Charge". No image of the emblem is available at this time. The emblem of the Bearers element was created by an unidentified Bearer in 2000. Symbolically, the emblem represents a casket draped with an American flag, flanked on both sides by eight stars which represent the number of body bearers required for a funeral with full military honors and the use of a caisson. The motto [...] "Last To Let You Down" [...] represents the loyalty and honor that the Bearers element accords to a fallen service member as well as literally letting (setting) the casket of the deceased down at the gravesite. The emblem of the Firing Party element was created in 2000 by Technical Sergeant Timothy Carney, then-NCOIC of the Firing Party element. Symbolically, the colors of yellow, black and gray represent the components of gunpowder: yellow for sulphur, black for <b>charcoal</b> and <b>gray</b> for potassium nitrate. The crossed rifles represent the primary weapon of the Firing Party and the three seven-pointed star-bursts represent three volleys of seven fired in unison. The twenty-one stars that encircle the emblem represent twenty-one rounds fired in honor of a fallen service-member. The motto, [...] "Excolo Per Ignis" [...] is Latin for [...] "to honor by fire" [...] which is the primary duty of the Firing Party element.|$|R
