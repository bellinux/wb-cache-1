5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating.

40|$|We {{prove that}} in an undirected graph there are at most O(n 2) <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> size {{strictly}} less than 3 = 2 of the size <b>of</b> the minimum <b>cut.</b> 1 Introduction Recently {{there have been a}} number of efforts to bound the number <b>of</b> nearly minimum <b>cuts</b> in a weighted undirected graph. Karger and Stein [2] show that there are at most n 2 ff <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> size no more than ff times the size <b>of</b> the minimum <b>cut,</b> where n is the number of vertices in the graph. Nagamochi, Nishimura, and Ibaraki [3] provide an improvement on this result by showing that if the size <b>of</b> the minimum <b>cut</b> is, then there are at most Γ n 2 Δ <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> size strictly less than 4 3. They demonstrate that their bound is tight with K 4, the complete graph on four vertices, which has 4 <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> size 3 and 3 <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> size 4, for a total of 7 ? Γ 4 2 Δ <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> size no more than 4 3 times the optimal.

40|$|A Hilbert Basis {{is defined}} as a to be a set of vectors $S$ such that every vector in the cone and lattice {{generated}} by $S$ can also be expressed as a non negative integer combinations of vectors in $S$. Goddyn (1991) conjectured that characteristic vectors <b>of</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> graphs form Hilbert Basis. A counter example to this conjecture was given by Laurent in 1996. We study the class <b>of</b> graphs whose <b>cuts</b> form a Hilbert basis and prove that the <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> graphs formed by uncontractions of $K_ 5 $ and those of $K_{ 3, 3 }$-free graphs form Hilbert bases. In addition, we repair an incorrect result of Laurent that says the <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> all proper subgraphs of $K_ 6 $ form Hilbert bases by proving that the <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> $K_ 6 setminus e$ do not form a Hilbert basis. We also study the cones, lattices and Hilbert bases of contractible cycles of projective planar graphs by looking at the <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> their dual graphs...|$|R

Essential amino acids except isoleusine, phenylalanine and tryptophan were significantly higher in loin <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> camel meat than that in ostrich meat. Similarly, the thigh <b>cuts</b> <b>of</b> camel meat had higher amounts of essential amino acids except tryptophan compared to ostrich meat. The protein nutritional value determined by the calculated protein efficiency ratio (C-PER) for ostrich meat cuts was lower (1. 05 and 1. 23 for loin and thigh, respectively) than that <b>of</b> camel <b>cuts</b> (21. 5 and 2. 13 respectively).

5|$|As {{they had}} done on More, the band saw a rough <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> the film and noted certain timings for cues with a stopwatch.

They were not worried about creating complete songs, feeling that any musical piece would be workable {{without the need for}} any solos, but nevertheless, under pressure to produce enough material, they managed to create a whole series of well-structured songs. Drummer Nick Mason recalls that the sessions were very hurried, and the band spent most of the time in Paris locked away in the studio.|$|E

5|$|For the negotiations, {{the studio}} {{requested}} that the cast members accept a 45 percent <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last. The actors {{were willing to take}} a pay cut, but wanted a percentage of the back-end payments instead. At one point Shearer even offered a 70 percent pay cut in exchange for back-end percentages, but the studio was unwilling to make any deal involving back-end percentages. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take a pay <b>cut</b> <b>of</b> 30 percent, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut. This included animators, writers, the post-production crew and even Jean himself. The further use of digital animation also saves money, as the animation of the show becomes more efficient.|$|E
