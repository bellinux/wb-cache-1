5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, residents of the Donbass were generally in favour of stronger ties with Russia, in contrast to the rest of Ukraine. A 1993 strike by miners in the region called for a federal Ukraine and economic autonomy for Donbass. This was followed by a 1994 <b>consultative</b> <b>referendum</b> on various constitutional questions in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, held concurrently with the first parliamentary elections in independent Ukraine. These questions included whether Russian should be enshrined as an official language of Ukraine, whether Russian should be the language of administration in Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, whether Ukraine should federalise, and whether Ukraine should have closer ties with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Close to 90% of voters voted in favour of these propositions. None of them were adopted: Ukraine remained a unitary state, Ukrainian was retained as the sole official language, and the Donbass gained no autonomy.|$|E

2500|$|Until 1991, President Mauno Koivisto {{and two of}} {{the three}} major parties, Center Party and the Social Democrats opposed the idea of European Union {{membership}} and preferred entering into the European Economic Area treaty. However, after Sweden had submitted its membership application in 1991 and the Soviet Union was dissolved {{at the end of the}} year, Finland submitted its own application to the EU in March 1992. The accession process was marked by heavy public debate, where the differences of opinion did not follow party lines. Officially, all three major parties were supporting the Union membership, but members of all parties participated in the campaign against the membership. [...] Before the parliamentary decision to join the EU, a <b>consultative</b> <b>referendum</b> was held on April 16, 1994 in which 56.9% of the votes were in favour of joining. The process of accession was completed on January 1, 1995, when Finland joined the European Union along with Austria and Sweden. Leading Finland into the EU is held as the main achievement of the Centrist-Conservative government of Esko Aho then in power.|$|E

5000|$|The Spanish Constitution of 1978 {{allows for}} <b>consultative</b> <b>referendums</b> on [...] "political {{decisions}} of special importance" [...] (Art. 92): however, {{the holding of}} such a referendum requires the approval of both {{the government and the}} Congress of Deputies (the lower house of the Cortes Generales).|$|R

5000|$|The mayors of the Netherlands are not elected but {{appointed}} by the crown.

This was also tried in Eindhoven and as a result the current mayor is Rob van Gijzel (PvdA).|$|R
50|$|The {{first major}} {{constitutional}} reform came in 1983, with the re-writing of many important provisions governing parliamentary procedure, {{mostly in the}} Parliament Act. However, the most extensive and important reforms came in 1987, when provisions on the holding of <b>consultative</b> <b>referendums</b> {{were added to the}} Constitution. The indirect form of electing the President of the Republic via an Electoral College was replaced by a system which combined the Electoral College with direct election, and the provisions governing the postponement of ordinary legislation were amended by shortening the period for which a bill could be postponed.|$|R
5000|$|The law {{lowered the}} {{requirements}} for number of votes needed to approve the resolution.

50|$|There {{are three}} types of referendums in Malta: constitutional, <b>consultative</b> and abrogative <b>referendums.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Legislative {{is formed}} by Government (i.e. King and ministers) and the States General in {{cooperation}} (Article 81), although the term [...] "legislative" [...] is not actually used: the article simply states that {{government and the}} States General together make laws. This means that the Dutch concept of [...] "formal law" [...] cannot simply be equated to [...] "Act of Parliament", as government and parliament act in unison in creating laws. In the Dutch constitutional system there is no decisive <b>referendum,</b> although sometimes <b>consultative</b> <b>referenda</b> are held, {{like the one in}} 2005 in which the people advised to reject the European Constitution; the Dutch people is thus not a direct lawgiver.|$|R

The opposition parties (Alliance for Sweden) stated that if they were to form a cabinet after the general election—which was held the same day as the congestion tax referendums—they would take into consideration the referendums held in several of the other municipalities in Stockholm County as well. The results of the referendums were that the Stockholm Municipality voted for the congestion tax, while the other municipalities voted against it. The opposition parties won the general election and a few days before they formed government (Reinfeldt Cabinet) they announced that the congestion tax would be reintroduced in Stockholm, but that the revenue would go entirely to road construction in and around Stockholm. During the trial period and according to the agenda of the previous government the revenue went entirely to public transport.|$|R
