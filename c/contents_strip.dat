40|$|Several {{processes}} and products {{are available to}} produce warm mix asphalt (WMA). The use of those may reduce the mixing and compaction temperatures in relation to hot mix asphalt (HMA), ensuring a good performance of the pavement. Lower plant mixing temperatures mean reduction in fuel consumption and lower emissions, what may contribute to diminish odours and health problems. A laboratory study on {{the properties of the}} modified binders (using two commercial WMA additives—Sasobit® and Cecabase®) was carried out through conventional (penetration, softening point), dynamic viscosity and rheology (DSR) tests, in order to establish the optimum additive <b>content.</b> <b>Stripping</b> of binder from the aggregates is a reported problem in WMA. Thus, the affinity of the modified binders was assessed without encountering significant problems. It was also observed that only Sasobit® alters the viscosity of the binder.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was carried out}} to investigate the CBR behaviour of waste plastic strip reinforced-stone dust/fly ash overlying saturated clay. Three different sizes of waste plastic strips were used in this study. The effect of waste plastic <b>strip</b> <b>content</b> (0. 25 % to 4 %) and length on the CBR and secant modulus of strip reinforced-stone dust/fly ash overlying saturated clay was investigated. The study reveals that addition of waste plastic strip in stone dust/fly ash overlying saturated clay resulted in an appreciable increase in the CBR and the secant modulus. The reinforcement benefit increased {{with an increase in}} waste plastic <b>strip</b> <b>content</b> and <b>strip</b> length. The benefit of adding waste plastic strips beyond 2 % does not improve the CBR or secant modulus appreciably. Reinforced stone dust is more effective than reinforced fly ash overlying saturated clay in improving the behaviour of the system. The material can be used in base courses in constructing rural roads over saturated clay, thereby leading to safe disposal of these waste materials in an environmentally friendly manner. Further research is recommended to study the cost economics of the use of waste materials in base courses in rural roads...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} and compare the collagen profile of two beef carcass cuts: silverside (M. semitendinosus) and strip loin (M. longissimus lumborum), originated from Polish Holstein-Friesian bulls of the black and white variety. Silverside showed higher total, acid-soluble, total soluble, and insoluble collagen <b>content</b> than <b>strip</b> loin. Significant differences between silverside and strip loin were noted in their share of water-soluble and acid-soluble collagen (% total collagen, P< 0. 05). The thermal treatment caused cooking losses, which reached 38 % in strip loin and 40 % in silverside. There were no significant differences in shear force values or organoleptic quality between the cuts, which indicates their similar usefulness as meat for roasting.

40|$|This is {{a report}} on the {{extraction}} of molybdenum(VI) ions using a supported liquid membrane, prepared by dissolving in kerosene, the extractant Alamine 336 (a long-chain tertiary amine) employed as mobile carrier. A flat hydrophobic microporous membrane was utilised as solid support.

The influence of feed solution acidity, the carrier extractant concentration in the organic liquid film and the <b>content</b> of <b>strip</b> agent on the metal flux through membrane were investigated. It was established that maximal extraction of metal is achieved at a pH 2. 0 if sulphuric acid is used in the feed solution and at a pH value over 11. 0 if Na 2 CO 3 is used as strip agent. Moreover, the molybdenum extraction through membrane is enhanced when a 0. 02 mol 1 (- 1) content of the amine carrier in the organic phase is used. The present paper deals with an equilibrium investigation of the extraction of Mo(VI) by Alamine 336 and its permeation conditions through the liquid membrane, and examines a possible mechanism of extraction...|$|R

40|$|The {{instability}} {{behavior of}} several supported liquid membranes (SLMs) {{has been studied}} for {{a system in which}} nitrate ions are removed from an aqueous feed phase and concentrated in a stripping phase.

From the experimental data it can be concluded that SLM-failure results from the removal of LM-phase from the support. Contrary to literature data this is not caused by an osmotic pressure difference. It is shown that the membrane stability depends largely on the type of solvent and the molecular structure of the carrier.

The physico chemical properties of the biodiesel/petro diesel blends were determined. The properties are specific gravity, viscosity, flash point, calorific value, sulphur <b>content,</b> copper <b>strip</b> corrosion, colour, diesel index, cetane number, and cloud point. It was observed that, 9 out of the 10 properties determined conform to ASTM standards except for the colour which was dark brown for the oil and biodiesel, and brown for the automotive gasoline oil. The specific gravity and viscosity increase with percentage increase of biodiesel in the blends. The sulphur content, calorific values, cetane number and diesel index decrease with increase in the percentage biodiesel from the blends. The colour of the samples does not conform to the ASTM standards. All the samples have the best ASTM value for copper strip corrosion and as such, they could be run in any diesel engine without any fear of corrosion tendencies.

40|$|Similar to ischemic preconditioning, {{diazoxide}} was documented {{to elicit}} beneficial bioenergetic consequences linked to cardioprotection. Inhibition of ATPase activity of mitochondrial F(0) F(1) ATP synthase {{may have a}} role in such effect and may involve the natural inhibitor protein IF(1). We recently documented, using purified enzyme and isolated mitochondrial membranes from beef heart, that diazoxide interacts with the F(1) sector of F(0) F(1) ATP synthase by promoting IF(1) binding and reversibly inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. Here we investigated the effects of diazoxide on the enzyme in cultured myoblasts. Specifically, embryonic heart-derived H 9 c 2 cells were exposed to diazoxide and mitochondrial ATPase was assayed in conditions maintaining steady-state IF(1) binding (basal ATPase activity) or detaching bound IF(1) at alkaline pH. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential and uncoupling were also investigated, as well as ATP synthesis flux and ATP content. Diazoxide at a cardioprotective concentration (40 muM cell-associated concentration) transiently downmodulated basal ATPase activity, concomitant with mild mitochondria uncoupling and depolarization, without affecting ATP synthesis and ATP <b>content.</b> Alkaline <b>stripping</b> of IF(1) from F(0) F(1) ATP synthase was less in diazoxide-treated than in untreated cells. Pretreatment with glibenclamide prevented, together with mitochondria depolarization, inhibition of ATPase activity under basal but not under IF(1) -stripping conditions, indicating that diazoxide alters alkaline IF(1) release. Diazoxide inhibition of ATPase activity in IF(1) -stripping conditions was observed even when mitochondrial transmembrane potential was reduced by FCCP. The results suggest that diazoxide in a model of normoxic intact cells directly promotes binding of inhibitor protein IF(1) to F(0) F(1) ATP synthase and enhances IF(1) binding indirectly by mildly uncoupling and depolarizing mitochondria...|$|R
