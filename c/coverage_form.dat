This study tests whether three content characteristics - personalized, contest and negative coverage - manifest a single media logic by analysing whether they co-vary over time. It also tests the implicit assumption underlying the media logic thesis that media adhere to a single media logic as one institution.

40|$|The glass {{production}} {{industry is}} one of the major users of natural gas in the US, and approximately 75 % of the energy produced from natural gas is used in the melting process. Industrial scale glass melting furnaces are large devices, typically 5 or more meters wide, and twice as long. To achieve efficient heat transfer to the glass melt below, the natural gas flame must extend over a large portion of the glass melt. Therefore modern high efficiency burners are not used in these furnaces. The natural gas is injected as a jet, and a jet flame forms in the flow of air entering the furnace. In most current glass furnaces the energy required to melt the batch feed stock is about twice the theoretical requirement. An improved understanding of the heat transfer and two phase flow processes in the glass melt and solid batch mix offers a substantial opportunity for energy savings and consequent emission reductions.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis two model systems, {{important}} in heterogeneous catalysis, where investigated. The study was mainly performed using surface sensitive spectroscopies, which are variations of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, namely XPS, SRPES and XAES. Other surface sensitive techniques employed were: Low Energy Electron Difraction (LEED), Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (ISS), Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and Contact Potential Difference (CPD) measurements. The bi-metallic system Sn/Ni was initially investigated, {{starting with the}} study of surface alloying conditions of Sn on Ni(111). It {{was found that the}} necessary condition for the formation of an epitaxial surface alloy with structure (? 3 x? 3) R 30 ° and 0. 3 ML coverage on the Ni(111) surface, is to have an initial Sn coverage higher than one ML which then has to be annealed at 7000 C for some minutes. Next, the c(4 x 2) and c(2 x 2) ordered structures were studied and found to be an intermediate step of the surface alloying process. The interaction between Sn and the Ni(111) surface was spectroscopically asserted by the 0, 27 eV chemical shift of the Sn 4 d XPS peak and the appearance of new components at the valence band spectrum, which were also predicted by first principle calculations. The main part of the thesis was the study of surface science compatible model catalysts of the Ziegler-Natta (ZN) system. In order to study these highly complex catalytic systems in an atomic level using surface sensitive spectroscopies, the interfaces between the main components of the real catalyst were considered separately. In this concept the interface formation during evaporation of MgCl 2 on Si(111) 7 ? 7, Ti(0001) and SiO 2 and during the evaporation of Ti on MgCl 2 /SiO 2 mixed substrate were investigated. Considering the growth of MgCl 2 on Si(111) 7 ? 7, it was found that it follows a layer by layer mode, while the interaction between the two materials at room temperature is rather weak. The interaction takes place through the Mg atoms, which at low <b>coverage</b> <b>form</b> a new surface structure, namely (? 3 x? 3) R 30 °. At higher MgCl 2 coverage the same superstructure could be observed after annealing. The interaction of MgCl 2 with Si(111) 7 ? 7 was stronger after annealing, where desorption of molecular MgCl 2 takes place, followed by decomposition of the remaining MgCl 2 leaving submonolayer coverage of Mg atoms on the surface. The 7 ? 7 reconstruction vanishes while a new component characteristic of the interfacial reaction products appears in the valence band. During step by step deposition of MgCl 2 on Ti(0001) in was found that MgCl 2 interacts strongly with the substrate even at room temperature. The interaction takes place via Cl atoms of the deposit that tend to form chemical bonds with the Ti atoms of the substrate. Annealing of the surface causes the desorption of molecular MgCl 2 followed by decomposition that leaves on the surface only Cl atoms attached to Ti. Contrary to the case of the Si(111) 7 ? 7 substrate, no Mg atoms remain on the Ti(0001) surface after annealing and no new superstructure is observed. Nevertheless, the interaction leads to the appearance of a new component at the valence band spectrum. The MgCl 2 / SiO 2 interface models the porous mixed substrate used at the industrial ZN catalysts. Only a weak interaction was observed between MgCl 2 and SiO 2 while annealing the sample resulted again to the desorption and decomposition of MgCl 2 leaving on the surface a sub-monolayer coverage of oxidized Mg. A final experiment was designed in order to investigate the interaction between three different components of the real ZN catalyst. Ti was evaporated on the mixed MgCl 2 / SiO 2 support. It was found that even at room temperature Ti appears at higher oxidation states due to the reaction with Cl and O atoms at the surface. Annealing in this case causes the partial desorption of Cl while the remaining surface chemical species contain Mg, Cl, Ti and O. ...|$|E

The results indicate that oxygen atoms adsorbed at back-bond sites satisfy the bond saturation conditions and do not induce surface gap states. However, due to the oxygen replacement of an As dimer atom at a trough site or row site, the As-As bond is broken, and gap states are produced leading to the Fermi level pinning because of unsaturated As dangling bonds.

30|$|Although polymer {{networks}} are considered largely insoluble structures, with relatively high chemical and thermal stability, {{in the oral}} environment composite resins may absorb water and chemicals from the environment and release components into its surroundings. The water uptake (sorption phenomena) results in physical alterations, such as swelling and plasticization, and favors the hydrolytic degradation of polymers by chain scission, functional group cleavage by acids and oxidation [23]. In this study, the without silane ECR group, in which the microfillers were added without previous silane treatment, presented the highest water sorption mean (Table  1). This fact {{is the result of}} the strong attraction between the nude fillers and water molecules that penetrated into the polymer network. The free hydroxyls groups on the filler surface attract water forming hydrogen bonds (adsorption). On a lower scale, it is also possible that the water could cause the erosion of the filler particle surfaces [24]. In this study, when the micro-fillers were previously silanized a significant reduction in this phenomenon was observed, except for the 3  % silane group, which showed higher water sorption. Probably this percentage resulted in optimal microfiller <b>coverage,</b> <b>forming</b> a parallel monomolecular silane layer, and consequently reducing the number of free hydroxyls [16].|$|R
