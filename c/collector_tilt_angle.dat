The material used is wood frame with insulating material zinc in black paint. Temperature measurements carried out in an open space with solar energy as a source of energy for heating. Measurements were taken from 09. 00 am - 17. 00 pm with measurements every hour.

40|$|One of the {{important}} parameters that affect {{the performance of a}} solar collector is its tilt angle with the horizon. This is because of the variation of tilt angle changes the amount of solar radiation reaching the collector surface. Meanwhile, is the rule of thumb, which says that solar collector Equator facing position is the best, is valid for tropical region? Thus, it is required to determine the optimum tilt as for Equator facing and for Pole oriented collectors. In addition, the question that may arise: how many times is reasonable for adjusting <b>collector</b> <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> for a definite value of surface azimuth angle? A mathematical model was used for estimating the solar radiation on a tilted surface, and to determine the optimum tilt angle and orientation (surface azimuth angle) for the solar collector at any latitude. This model was applied for determining optimum tilt angle and orientation in the tropical zones, on a daily basis, as well as for a specific period. The optimum angle was computed by searching for the values for which the radiation on the collector surface is a maximum for a particular day or a specific period. The results reveal that changing the tilt angle 12 times in a year (i. e. using the monthly optimum tilt angle) maintains approximately the total amount of solar radiation near the maximum value that is found by changing the tilt angle daily to its optimum value. This achieves a yearly gain in solar radiation of 11 % to 18 % more than the case of a solar collector fixed on a horizontal surface. </p...|$|E

The solar collectors are intended to constitute {{a part of the}} roof construction. The system design is suggested as an energy solution for a 202 m 2 single-family demo dwelling of Zero Emission Building standard. The demo project is a collaboration between Br&# 248;drene Dahl and the Research Centre on Zero Emission Buildings. The dwelling will be constructed in Larvik in South Norway. A parametric study of the main design and operation parameters were conducted in order to find the optimum values which would result in the lowest total electricity use in the system. The design and operating parameters which were optimized included collector area, orientation and tilt angle, fluid type for both collectors and ground-source heat exchanger, collector mass flow rate, storage tank design, heat exchanger effectiveness, collector heat loss, design of ground-source heat exchanger, control settings, supply air and zone set point temperature, supply air volume flow rate, night setback control and heat distribution temperature. The optimum values were determined by using the dynamic simulation software tool IDA Indoor Climate and Energy 4. 6. Scenarios with different configurations of optimized design and/or operating parameters were developed in order to investigate the effect of optimizing few, several or all of the components in the system, thus finding the composition which resulted in the lowest electricity use. As the marginal cost of expanding the solar collector area is relatively small compared to the system cost, the share of utilized renewable energy for space heating and domestic hot water was investigated for the optimized scenario with both 8 m 2 and 16 m 2 of installed solar collector area. The results showed that by optimizing the design of the storage tanks, a 5 % reduction in electricity use was achieved. Optimizing the tilt angle, orientation and heat loss coefficients of the solar collectors resulted in a 4 % reduction in electricity use. The results revealed that changing the operating parameters had the greatest effect on the electricity use relative to parameter changes. A total reduction of 7 % was obtained by optimizing the main system operating parameters. With all main design and operating parameters optimized, a total reduction of 18 % in electricity use was obtained with 16 m 2 of solar collector area installed. A total reduction of 14 % in electricity use was obtained with 8 m 2 of solar collectors installed. Without optimizing the solar collectors, a total reduction of 14 % was obtained with a collector area of 16 m 2. The highest amount of renewable energy covering the total heating load was obtained with 16 m 2 of solar collector area installed and all main design and operating parameters optimized. It was found that 85 % of the total heating demand was covered by renewable energy. The results showed that by utilizing solar energy the optimized system could provide 85 - 92 % and 12 - 70 % of the domestic hot water demand in summer and winter respectively, and 2. 5 - 100 % of the space heating demand. It can be concluded that by installing a larger solar collector area in combination with a ground-source heat pump, a higher share of utilized renewable energy as well as a higher reduction in delivered energy is obtained.

The results show that, on a monthly basis when the collector is mounted at the yearly optimum <b>tilt</b> <b>angle,</b> the loss of radiation intercepted is less than 10 % as compared to the monthly optimum <b>tilt</b> <b>angle.</b> The optimum seasonal <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> reduces the incident radiation by less than 2 % from that of the monthly optimum <b>tilt</b> <b>angle.</b> King Saud Universit...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to the relatively large <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> of AgNRs, we also find the influence of substrate temperature on the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle.</b> Even though no noticeable change was observed in this work, the observation in a previous report clearly shows that the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> of AgNRs decreases as the substrate temperature is lowered [25]. The <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> of the AgNRs, fabricated by an e-beam evaporator with 86 ° of deposition angle, was observed to decrease by ~ 2 ° when the substrate temperature was lowered from room temperature to 140 K [25]. Our observation of no noticeable variation of the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> in the whole temperature range, 10 – 70 °C {{can be interpreted as}} the variation of the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> was too small to be observed clearly.|$|R
40|$|Sunspot {{positions}} {{from various}} historical sets of solar drawings are analysed {{with respect to}} the <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> of bipolar sunspot groups. Data by Scheiner, Hevelius, Staudacher, Zucconi, Schwabe, and Spoerer deliver a series of average <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> spanning a period of 270 years, additional to previously found values for 20 th-century data obtained by other authors. We find that the average <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> before the Maunder minimum were not significantly different from the modern values. However, the average <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> of a period 50 years after the Maunder minimum, namely for cycles 0 and 1, were much lower and near zero. The normal <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> before the Maunder minimum suggest that it was not abnormally low <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> which drove the solar cycle into a grand minimum.

40|$|A {{reasonable}} {{estimation of}} the optimal <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> of a fixed collector for maximizing its energy collection must be done based on the monthly global and diffuse radiation on a horizontal surface. However, the monthly diffuse radiation is not always available in many places. In this paper, a simple mathematical procedure for the {{estimation of the}} optimal <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> of a <b>collector</b> is presented based on the monthly horizontal radiation. A comparison of the optimal <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> of <b>collectors</b> obtained from expected monthly diffuse radiation and that from the actual monthly diffuse radiation showed that this method gives a good estimation of the optimal <b>tilt</b> <b>angle,</b> except for places with a considerably lower clearness index. A contour map of the optimal <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> of the south-facing collectors used for the entire year in China is also outlined, based on monthly horizontal radiation of 152 places around the country, combing the optimal <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> of another 30 cities based on the actual monthly diffuse radiation.

30|$|A {{comparison}} {{study of}} the monthly optimum <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> was made with the optimum <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> at solar noon and the Nijegorodov et al. model. For the former comparison, the average deviation was about 1.6 ° and the standard deviation was evaluated to be 1.8 °. The latter comparison showed that the average deviation was 5.4 ° and the standard deviation was 6.6 °. The present {{results indicated that the}} simple method of finding optimum <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> at solar noon could be suitably used to estimate the monthly optimum <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> for low latitude region.|$|R
50|$|To {{improve the}} roll {{stability}} in transient conditions, the prototype CLEVER vehicle was fitted with an active steering system in 2012; this allowed {{the use of}} a combined Steering Direct Tilt Control (SDTC) strategy. The active steering system output {{is a function of the}} vehicle’s <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> error (the difference between the actual and ideal <b>tilt</b> <b>angle),</b> therefore at steady state when there is little or no <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> error the front wheel steer angle matches the driver’s steer demand. However, in transient situations, such as upon turn-in, a <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> error exists and the active steering system acts to reduce or eliminate the driver’s steering input. In extreme conditions it will also initiate a countersteering action whereby the front wheel momentarily steers in the opposite direction to that intended by the driver. As the cabin approaches the desired <b>tilt</b> <b>angle,</b> the magnitude of the <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> error is reduced and the front wheel steer angle takes on the value demanded by the driver.|$|R
