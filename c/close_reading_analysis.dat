40|$|From its {{capacity}} to preserve and repeat performances to its ability {{to be used as}} tool of composition, recording technology has had a wide-ranging impact on twentieth century compositional practice. This dissertation explores this impact via <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> and <b>analysis</b> of two works: Arnold Schoenberg 2 ̆ 7 s Opus 45 Trio for Violin, Viola, and Cello, which was written at the historical moment Schoenberg could first expect his composition to be recorded; and Fatboy Slim 2 ̆ 7 s Talking 2 ̆ 7 Bout My Baby, which was written using recording technology as the primary compositional tool. ^ Chapters 2 and 3 use a combination of historical evidence and <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> and <b>analysis</b> to explore the impact of recording on compositional practice when the possibility of recording was {{in the mind of the}} composer as he composed. Chapter 2 considers how Schoenberg capitalized on the repeatability of recording to produce compositional and hermeneutic difficulty, and chapter 3 explores his use of recapitulation as an embodiment of recording technology in the making of musical autobiography. Chapters 4 and 5 explore the impact of recording on compositional practice and the musical work when recording technology is used as the primary compositional tool. Chapter 4 considers the gradual effacement of performers and performance from the production of music and discusses how this effacement questions authenticity and the musical work before delineating the compositional potentials afforded when composing with recording technology exclusively. Chapter 5 illustrates these potentials through the <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> and <b>analysis</b> of Fatboy Slim 2 ̆ 7 s Talking 2 ̆ 7 Bout My Baby, a composition engineered from connoted musical parameters and situated in musical simulacra. ...|$|R

40|$|John Donne’s two Anniversary poems (1611 - 12) {{historically}} have received negative criticism {{because of their}} hyperbolic praise of Elizabeth Drury. They have also been examined as either complementary or as distinct in a failed series. This study, using <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> <b>analysis,</b> examines the Anniversaries using the alchemical imagery found within the eulogy sections of both poems to reinterpret the nature and function of Elizabeth Drury in each poem and to argue for the poems ’ complementary nature. Donne’s use of alchemical imagery, throughout his canon, is well documented. When Louis Martz, in 1947, concluded that the Anniversaries followed the Ignatian meditation format of Introduction, Body (with sections comprised of meditation, eulogy, refrain/moral), and Conclusion, he invited further investigations of the separate sections.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} role of the war {{memories}} {{in the construction of the}} female gender identity in Evelyin Shakir's "Oh, Lebanon," in which the female protagonist refuses to belong to her Arab identity when she lives in the United States because of the brutal war memories she witnesses in Lebanon. Such memories make the protagonist unable to accept her submissive gender role in the Arab culture. In other words, these memories of war motivate the protagonist to revolt against her father's will and to choose her own way of building her identity away from the influence of her Arab culture and traditions. The methodology of this paper is based on a <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> <b>analysis</b> of some quotations from Shakir's short story which will be analyzed to see how the war memories in Lebanon have influenced the construction of the protagonist's gender identity.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} peer-reviewed data and statistics in news communication of science through a content analysis and <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> <b>analysis</b> of statistical data in the United Kingdom science news and in-depth interviews with science journalists. The content analysis yields three key insights into the use of science data in the United Kingdom and Brazilian press: (1) statistics are used overwhelmingly to treat science as hard news, (2) there is an immense lack of fundamental background information about how the reported data are produced and (3) science journalists tend to use peer-reviewed data in a unique fashion: their stories include either too few or too many statistics from original sources. The in-depth interviews attempt to explain this content pattern, examining how journalists access and interpret quantitative data when producing stories about science, the nature of statistical news sources that they regularly use, and how they evaluate and treat such sources in articulating science news stories. Overall, this research finds that journalists tend to see and use statistics mainly to maintain the strategic ritual of objectivity in their social construction of science. The findings {{will be discussed in}} relation to a comprehensive body of literature on the use and abuse of statistical information as a key tool in the construction of journalistic objectivity...|$|E
40|$|Current media {{attention}} on the crossover novel highlights the increasing permeability of the boundaries between young adult and adult fiction. This paper will focus upon some of the difficulties around definitions of young adult fiction before considering the fiction of football, or soccer as it is more commonly known in Australia. The football genre exhibits a number of discrete and identifiable differences between young adult and adult readerships including, for example, {{the role of the}} protagonist, and the narrative’s distance from the game. This paper will use Franco Moretti’s Mapping as Distant Reading model of abstraction to highlight and unpack these and other characteristic differences in the narratological and stylistic techniques employed across adult and young adult texts. <b>Close</b> <b>reading</b> <b>analysis</b> of the adult football fiction Striker (1992) by Hunter Davies and young adult football fiction Lucy Zeezou’s Goal (2008) by Liz Deep-Jones’ will further illustrate the range of tensions and divergences as they are reflected across those readerships.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a {{text analysis}} of the short novel Carmilla (1872) by the Irish ghost story-author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu. It is a <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> <b>analysis</b> where I apply a queer theoretical perspective using Mia Franck’s model to analyze different silence practices in Carmilla. I focus on the female vampire Carmilla and her companion Laura {{and how they are}} portrayed in this short novel. I will ask the questions: do the characters Carmilla and Laura show a non-heterosexual relationship, passion and desire? How do they depart from the gender norm and can they be seen as characters who deviate from what society considers ‘normal’ behaviour? And can Carmilla and Laura’s relationship be seen as an example of silenced homosexuality and in what way is it expressed? Carmilla and Laura’s behaviour can certainly be described as queer and it is effective to examine the novella using silence practices through a queer perspective. Many of the practices are written silences. Mostly, its things that the reader realizes before the storyteller Laura does herself. They reveal numerous oddities in the story, taking the form of narrative, camouflaged, performative, ritualized and existential silences. Prominent examples are the way Carmilla hides both her vampiric and lesbian sides which Laura is repelled at in addition to her own lustful and passionate emotions. As a future teacher, one of my most important jobs will be to educate my pupils about democratic values and that all kinds of discrimination should be discouraged. An essay of this sort is one way to educate them in how gender and sexuality can be seen from historical, political and cultural perspectives...|$|E
40|$|Inspired by Charles Taylor’s A Secular Age (2007), {{this thesis}} reconsiders ‘the secular’ {{from within the}} {{discipline}} of literature and theology, employing comparative literature as a methodology. Focusing on the writings of two modern authors of religious doubt, Graham Greene and Naguib Mahfouz, I argue that the secular as an ontological category is from its inception post secular. In the first theoretical part of this thesis, I explore religious utopianism, and argue against the notion that utopianism is a uniquely ‘Western’ concept by outlining its prevalence in non Western societies. Then, I theorise modern intimations of the secular as four dichotomies: faith/reason, this worldliness/otherworldliness, personal/communal and freewill/determinism. In doing so,I draw parallels between ideas of the secular from Western philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and Friedrich Nietzsche and classical Islamic thinkers like Ibn Sina and al-Farabi. Drawing from the concepts of ‘religious utopianism’ and ‘secular dichotomies’, I develop a comparative literary lens known as utopian theologics to explore secular narratives in the selected works of Greene and Mahfouz. The second part of this thesis applies utopian theologics, by first historicising the secular from the socio-political and biographical spheres of the two writers to map out their ‘lifeworlds’ in the Habermasian sense of the word. More elaborately, I embark on a <b>close</b> <b>reading</b> <b>analysis</b> of the selected works according to the dichotomies identified to explore the way their conventional hierarchical orders have been reversed, or rendered irrelevant by hybridisation. Finally, I conclude that the secular disposition, as intimated in the novels, falls apart when its polemics are investigated, though its sense of lasting realness {{in the modern world}} is fuelled by perceptions of religion’s seeming antithesis to the idea of human agency. The postsecular narratives that govern the selected works also suggest that humanity has an inclination for ‘sacred impulses’ despite the advent of ‘sacrilegious worlds’. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} an {{evaluation}} of the influence of the long-standing hermeneutics/positivist schism on explanations of the spatio-temporal characteristics of “the public sphere”, “the field”, and “the medium”. These are the signature terms in the seminal media-related works of Habermas, Bourdieu and McLuhan - “the public sphere” in The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere by Jurgen Habermas; “the field” in The Political Field, The Social Science Field, and the Journalistic Field and On Television by Pierre Bourdieu; and the “the medium” in Understanding Media by Marshall McLuhan. The key aim of thesis is to analyze the shaping impact of the long-standing hermeneutics/positivist schism on the methodologies employed. The thesis also considers whether the imbalances in the multidisciplinary methodologies of Habermas, Bourdieu and McLuhan brought about by this divide could have been addressed through the use of references, models and analogies from the sub-sciences of emergence and complexity theory. This evaluation includes the responses by critics and commentators to the methodologies used by Habermas, Bourdieu and McLuhan. A central argument is that the multidisciplinary methodologies of Habermas, Bourdieu and McLuhan were compromised by their tendency not to absorb science innovations, nor access new methodological ‘techniques’ – a tendency among many twentieth century academics in the humanities, according to media historian and social theorist John Durham Peters. <b>Close</b> <b>reading</b> <b>analysis</b> exposes the impacts of the hermeneutic/positivist schism on the methodologies of the three theorists. A further argument is that the hermeneutical tendencies present in their methodologies were brought about more by a rejection of positivism and ‘scientism’ than a conscious leaning towards hermeneutics. Habermas, Bourdieu and McLuhan some time ago created the sandbox of modern media theory. This thesis argues that the exceptional value of their media-related works will be well-served by the addition of analytical frameworks from the sub-disciplines of science such as emergence and complexity theory...|$|E

On a national level, {{and in a}} cyclic process with a time lap of 30 to 40 years, three architecture competitions have been realized during the 20 th century in order to renew spatial thinking concerning housing for dependent and frail persons in need of daily care and caring, in the following termed Residential Care Homes, RCH. During {{the first years of}} the 21 st century, the number of available flats in a RCH dropped with 23 per cent. As a result, the matter of appropriate housing for frail older people entered the political agenda. In 2010, the Swedish government launched the governmental program Growing Old, Living well, GOLW, in order to explore residential housing for the emerging ageing society. In the program, architecture competitions were recognized as a method for innovating architecture and the built environment.

40|$|More {{than mere}} tools for reading instruction, {{alphabet}} books offered nineteenth-century writers and illustrators {{a site for}} contesting dominant versions of literacy. They could address broad audiences in a genre that was uniquely suited to registering shifts {{in the social and}} material conditions of publishing, literacy, and education. This historical study recovers these efforts and traces the genre’s co-evolution with Victorian ideas about literacy. It exploits an overlooked material archive in order to refocus attention from the history of rising literacy rates, toward concurrent debates over how visual and oral culture should complement printed text within domestic education and formal schooling. “Doubtful Characters” focuses on figures prominent in Victorian publishing, and reveals how the alphabet books they designed resisted pedagogues’ overweening emphasis on textual decoding. George Cruikshank, William Makepeace Thackeray, and Walter Crane promoted forms of visual literacy, including caricature and holistic book design. Edward Lear revived aspects of oral culture embedded within print. However, after national education reform (ca. 1870), alphabet illustration tended to leverage nostalgia against pedagogy. This is seen in works by Kate Greenaway and Hablot Knight Brown (“Phiz”). The study concludes by exploring satirical interpretations of the alphabet produced by Hilaire Belloc and Rudyard Kipling at the fin de siècle, which reflected growing ambivalence about industrialized print culture. While recovering designers’ strategic use of satire and production values in alphabet books, “Doubtful Characters” resists assumptions about the transparent goals of didactic texts, and exposes the fragility of audience conventions. Satirical alphabets most clearly challenged a child-oriented perspective on literacy education and illustration that took hold {{by the turn of the}} twentieth century, and provided an effective platform for commenting on the ways that literacy was taught and exercised. But this study also shows how alphabet books deployed aesthetic theory, commercial contexts, and other rhetorical strategies in order to address adult audiences alongside or even instead of children. Through a combination of <b>close</b> <b>reading,</b> <b>analysis</b> of material culture, and historical contextualization of a series of illustrated alphabets, “Doubtful Characters” demonstrate how the form routinely interrogated and promoted a configuration of relationships among media forms and audience categories...|$|E
