5|$|While {{the lightest}} (252Lr to 254Lr) and {{heaviest}} (266Lr) lawrencium isotopes are produced only as alpha decay products of dubnium (Z=105) isotopes, the middle isotopes (255Lr to 262Lr) {{can all be}} produced by bombarding actinide (americium to einsteinium) targets with light ions (from boron to neon). The two most important isotopes, 256Lr and 260Lr, are both in this range. 256Lr <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> by bombarding californium-249 with 70MeV boron-11 ions (producing lawrencium-256 and four neutrons), while 260Lr <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> by bombarding berkelium-249 with oxygen-18 (producing lawrencium-260, an alpha particle, and three neutrons).|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> only by producing less of the other.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to diamond, large c-BN pellets <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> in {{a simple}} process (called sintering) of {{annealing}} c-BN powders in nitrogen flow at temperatures slightly below the BN decomposition temperature.
