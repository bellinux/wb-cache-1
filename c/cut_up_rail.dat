The man {{was part of a}} crew engaged in trackwork that did not obtain necessary track possessions before proceeding to <b>cut</b> <b>up</b> spare <b>rails</b> by the track, and was subsequently hit from behind by the XPT on a blind curve at 69 kilometres per hour. When the XPT collided with the excavator, the excavator was propelled along the track for about 20 m before the extended boom struck a utility vehicle parked on the southern side of the track. The excavator and utility vehicle were then pushed off the track and came to rest about 38 m from the point of initial impact.|$|R
