40|$|Artificial {{intelligence}} has been implemented widely. Many of household products are designed based on artificial intellegence concept. One {{of them is}} fuzzy logic system. This paper describes on how a fuzzy logic system can also be implemented in controling {{the speed of a}} car in the road. The fuzzy inference system was designed according to Tsukamoto inferencing method and for the defuzzyfication method is used weighted average method. There are three inputs for the system. The are distance between <b>controled</b> <b>car</b> and the car infront of the <b>controled</b> <b>car,</b> distance between <b>controled</b> <b>car</b> and turning point in front of the car and the last is the current speed of the <b>controled</b> <b>car.</b> The output of the system is the next speed of the <b>controled</b> <b>car.</b> For every inputs, three predicates fuzzy are used. Therefore, there are 27 ruler of inference. From the experiment, it can be concluded that the system works well. The performance of the system closely relates with the membership function of each variabel...|$|R

25|$|The {{forward section}} of the <b>control</b> <b>car</b> was {{extensively}} glazed, and formed the pilot's cabin which housed all the flight controls, navigating instruments, engine telegraphs and voice pipes. Behind this was the wireless telegraphy cabin, while the living and sleeping accommodation for the 10-man crew was located {{at the rear of}} the car. In addition to the radio equipment, the wireless operators' compartment carried Aldis lamps as well as international maritime signal flags. The latter could be lowered from the <b>control</b> <b>car,</b> and were effective for communicating with foreign vessels.|$|E

25|$|The NTSB report {{concluded}} that the MARC crew apparently forgot the approach signal aspect of the Kensington color-position signal after making a flag stop at Kensington Station. The MARC train was operating in push mode with the cab <b>control</b> <b>car</b> out front. The Amtrak locomotives were in the crossover {{at the time of}} the collision; the MARC cab <b>control</b> <b>car</b> collided with the lead Amtrak unit, F40PH #255, rupturing its fuel tank and igniting the fire that caused most of the casualties. The second unit was a GE Genesis P40DC #811, a newer unit that has a fuel tank that is shielded in the center of the frame. The official investigation also suggests that the accident might have been prevented if a human-factors analysis had been conducted when modifications to the track signaling system were made in 1992 with the closing of nearby QN tower.|$|E

25|$|There {{were strong}} gales {{at the end}} of September 1918 causing {{difficulties}} landing the airships returning to the base. The extreme conditions resulted in four of the airships having to be 'ripped' once they had been maneuvered into the shelter of the hangars. Ripped is the term used when the rip cord attached to the <b>control</b> <b>car</b> is deliberately pulled to deflate panels sited on the airships. The airships ripped included a C10A and a SSZ65.|$|E

Harrisburg is also known for the Three Mile Island accident, which occurred on March 28, 1979 near Middletown.|$|E
25|$|Shenandoah was {{powered by}} , eight-cylinder Packard {{gasoline}} engines. Six engines were originally installed, but in 1924 one engine (aft of the <b>control</b> <b>car)</b> was removed. The first frame of Shenandoah was erected by 24 June 1922; on 20 August 1923, the completed airship was floated {{free of the}} ground. Helium cost $55 per thousand cubic feet at the time, and was considered too expensive to simply vent to the atmosphere {{to compensate for the}} weight of fuel consumed by the gasoline engines. Neutral buoyancy was preserved by installing condensers to capture the water vapor in the engine exhaust.|$|E

25|$|Currently, each {{train on}} the {{schedule}} is assigned a three-digit number indicating direction, sequence and stop pattern. This number {{is not to be}} confused with the locomotive number, which is the 9xx number physically stenciled on each engine. The second and third digits are always displayed on the leading element of the train (either the <b>control</b> <b>car,</b> for northbound trains, or the locomotive, for southbound trains); the MP36-3C locomotives have electronic displays showing all three digits of the train number when travelling southbound; when travelling northbound, the electronic display shows the 9xx locomotive number instead. The practice of placarding train numbers dates back to when the trains were operated by Southern Pacific.|$|E
25|$|The normal crew {{comprised}} two watches of five – {{necessary for}} extended patrols – {{and consisted of}} a Captain and Second Officer, a Coxswain and Second coxswain, two W/T Operators, two Engineers and two Air Gunners. The Captain was in overall command of the vessel, and was assisted by the Second Officer in navigating, maintaining height, and regulating gas pressure. The Coxswain {{was responsible for the}} rest of the crew, and for the care and maintenance of the ship whilst on the ground. He or the Second Coxswain steered the vessel in flight from a position at the very front of the <b>control</b> <b>car.</b> During patrols, the Air Gunners took on the duties of look-outs and also acted as cooks.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{cells were}} made of goldbeater's skins, {{one of the most}} gas-impervious {{materials}} known at the time. Named for their use in beating and separating gold leaf, goldbeater's skins were made from the outer membrane of the large intestines of cattle. The membranes were washed and scraped to remove fat and dirt, and then placed in a solution of water and glycerine in preparation for application to the rubberized cotton fabric providing the strength of the gas cells. The membranes were wrung out by hand to remove the water-glycerine storage solution and then rubber-cemented to the cotton fabric and finally given a light coat of varnish. The 20 gas cells within the airframe were filled to about 85% of capacity at normal barometric pressure. Each gas cell had a spring-loaded relief valve and manual valves operated from the <b>control</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2003, after {{receiving}} {{a grant from the}} Florida Department of Transportation, Tri-Rail contracted to purchase two pieces of rolling stock from Colorado Railcar: a self-propelled diesel multiple unit (DMU) prototype <b>control</b> <b>car</b> and unpowered bi-level coach entered regular service with Tri-Rail in October 2006. The new purpose-built railcars are larger than the Bombardier BiLevel Coaches, holding up to 188 passengers, with room for bicycles and luggage. Tri-Rail possessed four DMU control cars and two unpowered trailer cars. One DMU train usually consists of two DMU power cars at each end of a trailer coach (making for two complete DMU+trailer+DMU sets on the system). One trainset was sent to the SunRail Rand Yard in Sanford, FL, months before the system opened, for test purposes on their new commuter line. The trainset was sent back to the CSX Hialeah Yard soon after SunRail began revenue service.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-four {{coaches were}} built for {{push-pull}} operation on the suburban rail service including 5 built to Control Cars (6101–05, 6301–19). Originally {{used in conjunction}} with the 121 Class locomotives they were last used with 201 Class locomotives. There were a number of differences between the Irish push-pull Mark 3's and the standard Mark 3's. An underfloor generator, mounted in the <b>Control</b> <b>Car,</b> provided electrical power to the coaches; unlike on the standard Mark 3's, which used a special generator van. This single generator was not as powerful as the two used in the Mark 3 generator vans and was the main reason the sets were limited to 6 cars. Irish Mark 3 push-pull based rolling stock did not have air conditioning and had opening windows instead. There was also a 70mph speed restriction imposed on the train {{due to the fact that}} three of the Control Cars were fitted with LHB bogies from an 8100 Class DART. and were air-braked.|$|E

The NTSB described {{the conditions that}} day as a [...] "blowing snowfall" [...] with a [...] accumulation. At the time CSX provided the operating crew for MARC commuter trains under contract to the Maryland Mass Transit Administration; aboard were an engineer, conductor, and assistant conductor. The train consisted of an EMD GP39H-2 diesel locomotive, two passenger coaches, and a <b>control</b> <b>car.</b> The train operated in push-pull mode, meaning that the locomotive was on {{the rear of the}} train and the locomotive engineer controlled operations from the <b>control</b> <b>car</b> in the front.
