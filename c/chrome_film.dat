A new chuck directly interchangeable with a standard GCA 100 Millimeter wafer chuck was machined for simple conversion from STEPPER to PHOTOREPEATER.

40|$|The {{development}} of photomask reticle calibration standards for single particle instruments is discussed. The calibration method studied {{involves the use}} of photomask reticles where the particle artifacts are actually disks of <b>chrome</b> thin <b>film</b> in the clear field reticles produced by photolithography and etching processes. Consideration is given to various aspects of theory, design, and performance...|$|R
50|$|Lithographic photomasks are {{typically}} {{transparent fused silica}} blanks covered with a pattern defined with a <b>chrome</b> metal-absorbing <b>film.</b> Photomasks are used at wavelengths of 365 nm, 248 nm, and 193 nm. Photomasks have also been developed for other forms of radiation such as 157 nm, 13.5 nm (EUV), X-ray, electrons, and ions; but these require entirely new materials for the substrate and the pattern film.|$|R
40|$|A {{photomask}} typically {{consists of}} a bulk transparent substrate and a thin metallic film with etched pattern on the surface for light absorption. Stray light reflecting off of the top surface of the photomask is especially problematic because it is focused onto the wafer surface, causing unwanted exposure of the photoresist.. Lithographic performance can be significantly improved if this reflection is reduced with an antireflective layer on the top surface of the photomask. There are commercially developed antireflective films for chrome based photomasks. These films were designed to meet certain specifications for optical density and reflectivity. The goal of this project {{was to develop a}} process to replicate these commercial films at RIT. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy ~XPS) was performed on the commercial samples to obtain depth profiles of the atomic constituents of the chrome-based films. Absolute reflectivity and transmission data were obtained on these films using a Perkin-Elmer Lamba- 11 UV/VIS Spectrophotometer. Finally, a sputter deposition process was developed to deposit a <b>chrome</b> <b>film</b> with bulk properties {{similar to those of the}} commercial films. The process was tuned so that the reflectivity of the RIT film closely matched the reflectivity of the commercial films. The result was an antireflective optically dense film appropriate for photomasks for optical lithography...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of ten laser diffraction particle sizing instruments (Malvern models 2200 and 2600) has been evaluated using a synthetic particle size reference standard in a round-robin test at nine independent laboratories. A calibration reticle {{consisting of a}} two-dimensional array of opaque, circular particle images photoetched in <b>chrome</b> thin <b>film</b> deposited on a glass substrate {{was used as the}} reference. Mean diameters (e. g., D 32) for the reticle measured by the ten unmodified instruments varied by 27 percent.

25|$|Gaye {{acted in}} two movies, both {{having to do}} with Vietnam veterans. One was in 1969 in the George McCowan-directed film, The Ballad of Andy Crocker which starred Lee Majors. The film was about a war veteran {{returning}} to find that his expectations have not been met and he feels betrayed. Gaye had a prominent role in the film as David Owens. The other was in 1971. He had a role in the Lee Frost-directed biker-exploitation <b>film,</b> <b>Chrome</b> and Hot Leather, a film about a group of Vietnam veterans taking on a bike gang. The film starred William Smith and Gaye played the part of Jim, one of the veterans. Gaye did have acting aspirations and had signed with the William Morris Agency but that only lasted a year as Gaye wasn't satisfied with the support he was getting from the agency.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{systematic}} study of nickel <b>chrome</b> (NiCr) thin <b>film</b> resistors (TFRs) used as resistors in InP-based monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). The effects of fabrication process parameters (such as surface treatments or thermal cycles) and substrate materials on the electrical properties of NiCr TFRs are discussed. After completion of MMIC fabrication, the NiCr thin film resistors {{were found to}} exhibit lower sheet resistance (R-sh) {{as compared to the}} as-deposited films. The origin of this variation {{has been found to be}} mainly related to the post-NiCr thermal cycles involved in the IC process technology. In contrast, the R-sh values of NiCr TFRs deposited on GaAs or SiNx coated substrates were almost unaffected by thermal annealing. Hence, a thin SiNx passivation layer on the InP substrate has been integrated in the InP-based MMIC process to avoid the NiCr-InP interaction. As a result, NiCr thin film resistors with high sheet resistance uniformity and reproducibility, as well as low temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) have been achieved. Moreover, the use of a SiNx layer on the InP substrate was also found to improve the inter-device isolation...|$|R
40|$|In {{advanced}} {{nuclear energy}} systems, lead alloys emerge as strong candidates for transmutation and advanced reactor systems as nuclear coolants and spallation neutron targets. However, {{it is widely}} recognized that corrosion of materials caused by lead alloys presents a critical barrier to their industrial use. A few experimental research and development projects {{have been set up}} by different groups such as at Los Alamos National Laboratory to study the corrosion phenomena in their test facilities and to develop mitigation techniques and materials. One of the central or main techniques under development is to use active control of oxygen thermodynamic activity (OTA) to provide protective oxide layers. Setting OTA in flowing lead alloys makes corrosion highly dependent upon the oxygen concentration and the oxidation processes at materials surfaces. The active oxygen control technique exploits the fact that lead and bismuth are chemically less active than the major components of steels, such as Fe, Ni, and Cr. By carefully controlling the oxygen concentration in lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE), it is possible to maintain an iron- and <b>chrome</b> based oxide <b>film</b> on the surfaces of structural steels, while keeping lead and bismuth from excessive oxidization that can lead to precipitation contamination. Thermal analysis has given an ideal oxygen level range in a non-isothermal lead alloy coolant system. However, in a practical coolant loop, the proper oxygen level depends not only on thermal factors but also on hydraulic factors (system operating temperature, temperature profile, flow velocity, etc.). In addition, the oxygen distribution in a non-isothermal lead alloy coolant system is still unclear. The optimal oxygen levels still need to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|This {{prototype}} {{innovation is}} a novel design that achieves very long, effective laser path lengths {{that are able to}} yield ppb (parts per billion) and sub-ppb measurements of trace gases. SLIMS can also accommodate multiple laser channels covering a wide range of wavelengths, resulting in detection of more chemicals of interest. The mechanical design of the mirror cell allows for the large effective path length within a small footprint. The same design provides a robust structure that lends itself to being immune to some of the alignment challenges that similar cells face. By taking a hollow cylinder and by cutting an elliptically or spherically curved surface into its inner wall, the basic geometry of a reflecting ring is created. If the curved, inner surface is diamond-turned and highly polished, a surface that is very highly reflective can be formed. The surface finish can be further improved by adding a thin <b>chrome</b> or gold <b>film</b> over the surface. This creates a high-quality, curved, mirrored surface. A laser beam, which can be injected from a small bore hole in the wall of the cylinder, {{will be able to make}} many low-loss bounces around the ring, creating a large optical path length. The reflecting ring operates on the same principle as the Herriott cell. The difference exists in the mirror that doesn't have to be optically aligned, and which has a relatively large, internal surface area that lends itself to either open air or evacuated spectroscopic measurements. This solid, spherical ring mirror removes the possibility of mirror misalignment caused by thermal expansion or vibrations, because there is only a single, solid reflecting surface. Benefits of the reflecting ring come into play when size constraints reduce the size of the system, especially for space missions in which mass is at a premium...|$|R
