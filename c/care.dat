5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the hospice {{philosophy}} is that the <b>care</b> is patient-centered, to treat the whole patient.

40|$|Background: Research {{shows that}} nurse {{retention}} is {{high as a}} result of a stressful work environment coupled with inadequate support in clinical workplace. Caring among nurses is therefore crucial in enhanced and enriched the working environment that helps increase nurse’s satisfaction and retention in the profession. Purpose: To explore the meanings and expressions of <b>caring</b> among nurses in clinical workplace. Methods: Literature review of existing articles on electronic databases was conducted. The meanings and expressions of <b>caring</b> among nurses were identified. The year of publication ranged from 2000 - 2012. Result: Based on inclusion criteria, 10 articles reviewed were included. There was very limited result describing meanings of <b>caring</b> among nurses. However, <b>caring</b> expressions had been identified and categorized into personal and professional levels. There were some common themes such as <b>caring</b> through helping and support, <b>caring</b> through appreciating, and acknowledging unappreciated <b>caring.</b> Conclusion: Caring among nurses is very important to keep nurses emerged and able to work more effectively. However, <b>caring</b> varies within cultures and there are still limited studies among nurses in nonwestern society. Therefore, further research is needed to describe meanings and expressions of <b>caring</b> in clinical workplace that is beneficial in enhancing <b>caring</b> environment, increasing nurse’s satisfaction and nurse retention.

However, five designations {{of the main}} field ofstudy exist among the higher education institutions and the present thesisfocuses on the main field of study <b>caring</b> science.

The aim was to describe how growingin <b>caring</b> is experienced by student nurses during education. The theoretical perspective was <b>caring</b> science with focus on caringscience didactics, while the epistemological frame constituted of a phenomenological lifeworld approach. Data was gathered with interviews andwritten narratives at different occasions during the education in order tograsp the general structure of growing in <b>caring.</b> The findings illuminated that growing in <b>caring</b> means a struggle forone’s own <b>caring</b> beliefs to exist and survive in a world filled with diverseexpectations of <b>caring.</b> Through recognizing expectations of <b>caring,</b> studentnurses discover the complexity of <b>caring.</b> In this complexity, they understand themselves as being different and the otherness appears. The otherness consists of unique beliefs about <b>caring</b> based on former experiences. Inorder to give evidence for the otherness, concepts from <b>caring</b> theories thatagree with one’s own <b>caring</b> beliefs are found, which transform the concepts from being meaningless to being essential in <b>caring.</b> The conceptsstrengthen the student nurses’ growth in <b>caring</b> and constitute a support intheir discussions about <b>caring.</b> In this struggle for gaining access with theirotherness, they become convinced {{that they can make}} changes for the patient and strength arises to fight for their otherness. The study showed that the otherness appears as the hub in the studentnurse’s world, which gains nourishment to discover paths to think, feel andact in a <b>caring</b> manner.

40|$|Developing <b>caring</b> competences is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important aims of undergraduate nursing education and the role of clinical placement is recognised as special in this regard. Students' reflection on <b>caring,</b> their experience and obstacles in being <b>caring</b> is recommended as a key strategy in the process of teaching and studying the nursing discipline. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the concept of <b>caring,</b> its manifestations and possible obstacles while <b>caring,</b> as perceived by first-year nursing students before and after their first clinical placement. Qualitative content analysis of 15 Polish students' narratives written before and after their clinical experience in the form of text-diaries was undertaken. The findings revealed that students entered their nursing education with a deep humanistic vision of <b>caring</b> both on theoretical and practical levels and the first clinical placement has enriched this vision. Expressive <b>caring</b> was more appreciated by students than the instrumental one and their concept of <b>caring</b> was coherent with the <b>caring</b> behaviours as described in their narratives.

Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of <b>care</b> work and community work that women have to do.

40|$|Caring {{has been}} linked with the {{practice}} of nursing throughout history. As modern nursing strives to establish itself as a profession of <b>caring,</b> the need to identify the basic components of <b>caring</b> and how <b>caring</b> components are learned or transmitted has evolved. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if <b>caring</b> attitudes and behaviors were learned during the vocational educational process. Madeline Leininger's theory of <b>caring</b> provided the theoretical framework for this study. A comparative descriptive research design was employed. The Caring Ability Inventory (Nkongho, 1990) was used to assess a baseline for student <b>caring</b> and to determine any changes in the <b>caring</b> ability over time. The Nursing Clinical Teacher Effectiveness Inventory (Knox & Mogan, 1985) was used to establish student and faculty perceptions of <b>caring</b> attitudes and behaviors in the nursing faculty. A curriculum survey designed by Slevin and Harter (1987) was used to examine the nursing curriculum for various aspects of <b>caring.</b> Demographic data sheets were completed by students and faculty. Descriptive and multivariant statistics were used to analyze the data. The sample consisted of basic and advanced level nursing students (N = 142) and full time nursing faculty (N = 12) in a midwestern vocational nursing program. The results indicated that <b>caring</b> behaviors were not significantly changed during the program Faculty rated utilization of <b>caring</b> behaviors higher than did the students, particularly behaviors related to student evaluation. Faculty had difficulty identifying <b>caring</b> theory, <b>caring</b> concepts, and methods of teaching <b>caring</b> to students.
