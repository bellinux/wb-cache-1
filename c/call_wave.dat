It functions in a decentralized mode of operation, but is directly supervised by the Marine Tactical Air Command Center (TACC) or the Navy Tactical Air Control Center (NTACC). During amphibious or expeditionary operations, the DASC is normally the first MACCS agency ashore and is usually categorized (i.e.,scheduled or on <b>call</b> <b>wave)</b> as the Ground Combat Element's (GCE's) senior Fire Support Coordination Center (FSCC).

40|$|Systems {{of three}} or more {{conservation}} laws in which a conserved quantity is passively transported have a contact field; sometimes, the contact speed and the speed {{of one of the}} nonlinear waves coincide on a surface in state space. We prove that this resonance surface contains the equilibrium points of the contact field. We construct locally the Riemann solution for an example of such a system of three equations, which arises in flow in petroleum reservoirs. Solutions resulting from the resonating waves give rise to new objects, which we <b>call</b> <b>wave</b> surfaces. The complete Riemann solution is obtained by putting together transversely the wave surface and the remaining non resonant waves. In this example, the contact field has saddle points, and a new wave appears, a transitional contact wave. In the presence of this new wave, the Riemann solution for the system of three equations possesses four rather than three wave groups.

40|$|The Catmull-Clark {{subdivision}} algorithm {{consists of}} an operator that can be decomposed into a refinement and a smoothing operator, where the refinement operator splits each face with m vertices into m quadrilateral subfaces and the smoothing operator replaces each internal vertex with an affine combination of its neighboring vertices and itself. In this paper, we generalize the Catmull-Clark scheme. We consider an arbitrarily fixed number r of weighted averaging steps and allow that these r smoothing operators are different. These w(eighted) ave(raging) s(chemes) form an infinite class of stationary subdivision schemes, which we <b>call</b> <b>wave</b> shemes. This class includes the Catmull-Clark scheme and the midpoint schemes. For regular meshes, wave schemes generalize the tensor product Lane-Riesenfeld subdivision algorithm. We analyze the smoothness of stationary wave surfaces at extraordinary points using established methods for analyzing midpoint subdivision. For regular meshes, we analyze the smoothness of non-stationary wave schemes which need not be asymptotically equivalent to stationary schemes. Wave surfaces are smooth at their regular and, in most cases, extraordinary points...|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of monochromatic electromagnetic waves in stationary media {{is shown to}} be ruled by a frequency dependent function, which we <b>call</b> <b>Wave</b> Potential, encoded {{in the structure of}} the Helmholtz equation. Contrary to the common belief that the very concept of "ray trajectory" is reserved to the eikonal approximation, a general and exact ray-based Hamiltonian treatment, reducing to the eikonal approximation in the absence of Wave Potential, shows that its presence induces a mutual, perpendicular ray-coupling, which is the one and only cause of any typically wave-like phenomenon, such as diffraction and interference. Recalling, then, that the time-independent Schroedinger and Klein-Gordon equations (associating stationary "matter waves" to mono-energetic particles) are themselves Helmholtz-like equations, the exact, ray-based treatment developed for classical electromagnetic waves is extended - without resorting to statistical concepts - to the exact, trajectory-based Hamiltonian dynamics of mono-energetic point-like particles, both in the non-relativistic and in the relativistic case. The trajectories turn out to be perpendicularly coupled, once more, by an exact, stationary, energy-dependent Wave Potential, coinciding in the form, but not in the physical meaning, with the statistical, time-varying, energy-independent "Quantum Potential" of Bohm's theory, which views particles, just like the standard Copenhagen interpretation, as traveling wave-packets. These results, together with the connection which is shown to exist between Wave Potential and Uncertainty Principle, suggest a novel, non-probabilistic interpretation of Wave Mechanics.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of classical monochromatic waves in stationary media {{is shown to}} be ruled by a novel, frequency-dependent function which we <b>call</b> <b>Wave</b> Potential, and which we show to be encoded {{in the structure of}} the Helmholtz equation. An exact, Hamiltonian, ray-based kinematical treatment, reducing to the usual eikonal approximation in the absence of Wave Potential, shows that its presence induces a mutual, perpendicular ray-coupling, which is the one and only cause of wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference. The Wave Potential, whose discovery does already constitute a striking novelty in the case of classical waves, turns out to play an even more important role in the quantum case. Recalling, indeed, that the time-independent Schroedinger equation (associating the motion of mono-energetic particles with stationary monochromatic matter waves) is itself a Helmholtz-like equation, the exact, ray-based treatment developed in the classical case is extended - without resorting to statistical concepts - to the exact, trajectory-based Hamiltonian dynamics of mono-energetic point-like particles. Exact, classical-looking particle trajectories may be defined, contrary to common belief, and turn out to be perpendicularly coupled by an exact, energy-dependent Wave Potential, similar in the form, but not in the physical meaning, to the statistical, energy-independent "Quantum Potential" of Bohm's theory, which is affected, as is well known, by the practical necessity of representing particles by means of statistical wave packets, moving along probability flux lines. This result, together with the connection shown to exist between Wave Potential and Uncertainty Principle, allows a novel, non-probabilistic interpretation of Wave Mechanics.
