50|$|Ceravision has {{introduced}} a <b>combined</b> <b>lamp</b> and luminaire under the trade name Alvara for use in high bay and street lighting applications. It uses an optically clear quartz waveguide with an integral burner allowing all {{the light from the}} plasma to be collected. The small source also allows the luminaire to utilize more than 90% of the available light compared with 55% for typical HID fittings. Ceravision claims the highest Luminaire Efficacy Rating (LER) of any light fitting on the market and to have created the first High Efficiency Plasma (HEP) lamp. Ceravision uses a magnetron to generate the required RF power and claim a life of 20,000 hours.|$|R

40|$|The World Health Organization has {{targeted}} Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) for elimination by 2020 {{with zero}} incidence by 2030. To achieve and sustain this goal, accurate and easy-to-deploy diagnostic tests for Gambian trypanosomiasis {{which accounts for}} over 98 % of reported cases will play a crucial role. Most needed will be tools for surveillance of pathogen in vectors (xenomonitoring) since population screening tests are readily available. The development of new tests is expensive and {{takes a long time}} while incremental improvement of existing technologies that have potential for xenomonitoring may offer a shorter pathway to tools for HAT surveillance. We have investigated the effect of including a second set of reaction accelerating primers (stem primers) to the standard T. brucei gambiense LAMP test format. The new test format was analyzed with and without outer primers. Amplification was carried out using Rotorgene 6000 and the portable ESE Quant amplification unit capable of real-time data output. The stem LAMP formats indicated shorter time to results (~ 8 [*]min), were 10 – 100 -fold more sensitive, and indicated higher diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy compared to the standard LAMP test. It was possible to confirm the predicted product using ESE melt curves demonstrating the potential of <b>combining</b> <b>LAMP</b> and real-time technologies as possible tool for HAT molecular xenomonitoring...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The {{fluorescence}} of tubercle bacilli {{stained with}} auramine and rhoda-mine {{does not require}} ultra-violet light. It {{can be caused by}} blue light up to 406 mp. A’copper sdphate ammonia liquid filter, suitably diluted, will transmit this wave-band. A gelatin screen filter, absorbing all light below 510 mp. is used in the eyepiece. Normal, high intensity projection Alament <b>lamps,</b> <b>combined</b> with <b>lamp</b> condensers of large aperture, provide suitable light sources. The numerical aperture of the microsoope condenser must be fully used by immersion in glycerol. The fluorescence is vellry bright with the usual biological, and certain binocular, microscopes. The simplicity of the equipment enables fluorescence microscopy of tubercle bacilli to be used at low cost in any laboratory. The phenomenon of fluorescence as applied to stained bacilli may be described as follows. Certain fluorochroms (e. g. auramine) absorb light of a certain wave-length, and convert it into light energy of another wave-length. This effect is observed by illuminating the specimen with suitable light passed through a filter which transmits a wave-band capable of causing fluorescence, and b...|$|R
50|$|Most hanging ceiling lamps {{tend to be}} passively cooled, with a <b>combined</b> ballast and <b>lamp</b> fixture; {{immediately}} restoring {{power to}} a hot lamp before it has re-struck can make it take even longer to relight, because of power consumption and heating of the passively cooled lamp ballast that is attempting to relight the lamp.|$|R
25|$|There are {{two types}} of CFLs: {{integrated}} and non-integrated <b>lamps.</b> Integrated <b>lamps</b> <b>combine</b> the tube and ballast in a single unit. These lamps allow consumers to replace incandescent lamps easily with CFLs. Integrated CFLs work well in many standard incandescent light fixtures, reducing the cost of converting to fluorescent. 3-way lamps and dimmable models with standard bases are available.|$|R
5000|$|The LED {{filament}} {{style of}} <b>lamp</b> <b>combines</b> many relatively low-power LEDs on a transparent glass substrate, coated with phosphor, and then encapsulated in silicone.

2500|$|Incandescents reach full {{brightness}} {{a fraction}} of a second after being switched on. , CFLs turn on within a second, but many still take time to achieve full brightness. The light color may be slightly different immediately after being turned on. Some CFLs are marketed as [...] "instant on" [...] and have no noticeable warm-up period, but others can take up to a minute to reach full brightness, or longer in very cold temperatures. Some that use a mercury amalgam can take up to three minutes to reach full output. This and the shorter life of CFLs when turned on and off for short periods may make CFLs less suitable for applications such as motion-activated lighting. Hybrid <b>lamps,</b> <b>combining</b> a halogen <b>lamp</b> with a CFL, are available where warm up time is unacceptable. The halogen lamp lights immediately, and is switched off once the CFL has reached full brightness.|$|R

It was of fully stressed monocoque chassis-less construction, which made it lighter and stiffer than most contemporary vehicles, the first Austin {{to be made in}} this way. Inside there were individual seats at the front and a bench at the rear covered in PVC with an option of leather facings on the seats. Evidence of economy was seen in only having a single windscreen wiper, central <b>combined</b> stop/tail/numberplate <b>lamp</b> and a sun visor in front of the driver only.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate whether dedicated stop lamps, in comparison to stop lamps that are functionally combined with tail or turn signals, provide additional safety benefits at night. The analysis compared the frequencies of rear-end collisions in which the vehicles were struck to those collisions in which the same vehicles were the striking ones. The analysis used 1999 - 2003 Florida and North Carolina crash data. The vehicle sample consisted of 38 passenger car models for the years 1994 - 2003. Overall, the results include a statistically significant pattern that suggests a beneficial effect of dedicated stop lamps.

40|$|Unaware {{connection}} of {{high pressure sodium}} lamps to the grid, represent a relevant problem for the grid operators. They have several negative effects in the network, they can overload the circuits and {{affect the quality of}} the energy delivered to customers by the injection of harmonics. This thesis aims to answer the question: Can the high pressure sodium lamps connected to the grid be detected through measurements at a centralized location such as a substation? The hypothesis that the lamps have specific electrical characteristics which can be used for its detection, was stablished and validated. Current harmonics and power characteristics of several high pressure sodium lamps were measured. The measured values were used for simulations of the harmonic flow in a low voltage network, and to emulate aggregated measurements <b>combining</b> the <b>lamps</b> with several loads. These calculations were compared with field tests done with high pressure lamps in a low voltage network. The results prove that within certain limitations, in a combination of several loads, the high pressure sodium lamps characteristics can be enhanced in order to be detected and identified from the aggregated data.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades hollow-cathode lamps have been {{calibration}} standards for spectroscopic measurements. Advancing to cm/s radial velocity precisions {{with the next}} generation of instruments requires more suitable calibration sources with more lines and less dynamic range problems. Fabry-Perot interferometers provide a regular and dense grid of lines and homogeneous amplitudes making them good candidates for next generation calibrators. We investigate the usefulness of Fabry-Perot etalons in wavelength calibration, present an algorithm to incorporate the etalon spectrum in the wavelength solution and examine potential problems. The quasi periodic pattern of Fabry-Perot lines is used along with a hollow-cathode lamp to anchor the numerous spectral features on an absolute scale. We test our method with the HARPS spectrograph and compare our wavelength solution to the one derived from a laser frequency comb. The combined hollow-cathode lamp/etalon calibration overcomes large distortion (50 m/s) in the wavelength solution of the HARPS data reduction software. Direct comparison to the laser frequency comb bears differences of only maximum 10 m/s. <b>Combining</b> hollow-cathode <b>lamps</b> with Fabry-Perot Interferometers can lead to substantial improvements in the wavelength calibration of echelle spectrographs. Etalons can provide economical alternatives to the laser frequency comb, especially for smaller projects...|$|R
