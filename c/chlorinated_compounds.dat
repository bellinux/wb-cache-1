25|$|In an {{experiment}} conducted {{in conjunction with}} Batelle, a major contributor in the bioremediation industry, a plot of soil contaminated with diesel oil was inoculated with mycelia of oyster mushrooms; traditional bioremediation techniques (bacteria) were used on control plots. After four weeks, more than 95% {{of many of the}} PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) had been reduced to non-toxic components in the mycelial-inoculated plots.

40|$|<b>Chlorinated</b> {{aromatic}} <b>compounds</b> are {{an important}} group of compounds. Many {{of them have been}} produced in large quantities and they are indispensable to technological and societal benefits. But regulatory agencies have tightened regulations on the use and release of <b>chlorinated</b> aromatic <b>compounds</b> because of the scientific understanding of their toxicity, persistence, behavior in the environment and their potential to cause adverse effects on the ecosystem and human health. Pentachlorophenol (PCP), octachloronaphthalene and decachlorobiphenyl are all highly <b>chlorinated</b> aromatic <b>compounds,</b> of which, PCP has been used mainly as a biocide. Octachloronaphthalene and decachlorobiphenyl don't have practical use, but their congeners have been used widely as chemicals in industry. These compounds are toxic, recalcitrant and bio-accumulated within organisms. As the conventional treatment, incineration of these compounds can cause more serious problems, so that suitable alternatives need to be developed for their detoxification. When compared with biodegradation or the thermal treatment of these compounds, chemical degradations have several merits. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
