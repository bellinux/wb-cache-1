First, one may problematize the type of requirements specified in Goodman’s operationalization of <b>civic</b> <b>integration,</b> which {{do not reflect the}} working definitions (Mouritsen, 2013) of what she herself calls “the attributes of membership,” understood as “civitas, the condition of citizenship” (Goodman, 2012 b, p. 175). Goodman defines <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> as the application of a particular set of requirements - including country knowledge, language, liberal values, <b>integration</b> courses, tests, <b>contracts,</b> interviews and oath ceremonies.

This thesis examines how <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> strategies associate with immigration, and tests if <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies are connected to variations of immigration by certain category of entry. I argue in this thesis that the conditional factor in <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies creates a barrier for affected migrants and their possibility to gain long term residence in the host country. Based on theories of immigrant <b>integration</b> that relate <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> to the backlash against multiculturalism in Europe, the thesis emphasize a reasoning in which the push for internal inclusion seems to be associated with excluding implications.

The connection between the variables can however not be discerned from other integration requirements. The main concern is the lack of harmonized data, which obstructs the possibility to test for causality and to draw generalizing conclusions.

40|$|As {{scholars}} argue, {{there has}} been a rapid diffusion of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies in Western Europe the last decade.

Despite a flurry of literature based on <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies, attention drawn to the implication of these policies has been quite inferior. This paper tries to examine what <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies means in relation to immigration. Are <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies used as an informal tool for the purpose of limiting certain groups of immigrants? I argue in this paper that the conditional factor in the <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies creates a barrier for affected immigrants and their possibilities to gain long term residence. This is especially relevant for family migration. The material used for the empirical research emanates from Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) who addresses the existent of integration policies in several European countries, and OECD International Migration Outlook who estimates the immigration to European countries based on category of entry. The results presented here demonstrate that there is a connection between <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies and reduced family immigration. In comparison to other <b>integration</b> policies, <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies emerge in terms of correlation and significance. The main concern is the few studied cases in this research which unfortunately obstruct the possibility for generalization.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The neoliberalization of the Dutch {{citizenship}} {{manifests itself}} through the responsibilization, contractualization, and marketization of <b>civic</b> <b>integration.</b> We conceptualize <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> courses as a neoliberal citizenship ritual the migrants {{are required to}} participate in to earn Dutch citizenship. By studying the practice of Dutch <b>civic</b> <b>integration,</b> we demonstrate the repressive and productive aspects through which migrants and course providers become objects and subjects of the state’s neoliberal citizenship ideology. Our ethnographic data enables us to understand how <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> is experienced and interpreted by state agents and migrants. Cost optimization and quantitative policy targets have dominated; the quality of Dutch language teaching suffered, leaving the migrants without the power to vocalize and realize their own interests.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{participation}} of private initiative organization in conducting Dutch <b>Civic</b> <b>Integration</b> Act. The study was motivated {{by the fact that}} the Dutch government assigns immense accountability to the integration subject for participating in the <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> course. This responsibility assignment gives an opportunity for private organizations – for profit and non-profit – to perform the <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> affairs. Moreover, in implementing its ‘activation policy’, the state demands institutions and its social partners to give the space to citizens for their own initiative that will contribute to emancipation and social reintegration (VROM, 2007). Different roles that are performed by private initiative organizations could substitute or complement the state function in conducting the <b>Civic</b> <b>Integration</b> Act. This thesis studies the role and participation of non-profit organizations in the realm of civic integration; to what extent they participate. It also investigates whether their participation works effective in promoting active citizenship. Desk research, survey method, and case studies in four municipalities in the Netherlands (Amersfoort, Delfzijl, Rotterdam, and Utrecht) are performed. Based on a data study on 151 municipalities it is found that the role of private initiative organizations as external operating organizations for <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> is mainly apparent when the number of ethnic minorities in a certain municipality is medium. Further, 11 qualitative, in-depth interviews that were performed with representatives from municipalities, private initiative organizations, and language course providers show that private initiative organizations are beneficial in contributing executive, support, sustainability, and encounter role in the <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> realm. These roles hold up the active-participation policy that is endorsed by municipalities. Degree of participation from a private initiative organization in a municipality depends much on what kind of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> regulation that is performed in that particular municipality (self-regulated or outsourced). At the local level, municipality and private initiative organizations are complementing each other in promoting citizen’s active participation through <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> program. Private initiative organizations acquire resources, expertise, and experience in assisting the completion of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> program for municipality, yet they can hardly operate without sufficient (financial) support from the government. On the other hand, <b>Civic</b> <b>Integration</b> Act could not take place comprehensively without participation from private initiative organizations...|$|R

30|$|Bech, Borevi and Mouritsen {{argue that}} family reunification {{policies}} constitute one important, yet underexplored, field of <b>civic</b> <b>integration.</b> The article contributes to {{discussions about the}} definition and measurement of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> {{in response to the}} CIVIX index created by Goodman (2010, 2014). It makes two specific arguments. First, that economic demands and age-requirements for family reunification {{is part of a larger}} <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> trend pertaining to ideas and norms of civic maturity, gender equality and individual autonomy. Second, that we must take into account how family migration involves a ‘double conditionality’ whereby integration requirements target both the civic deservingness of the resident sponsor and the <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> potential of an incoming family member. Following this broader view of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> or indeed <b>civic</b> selection – and taking into account the argumentative structures surrounding policy change (and non-change) – the article systematically describes and compares the trajectories of family migration policies in the three Scandinavian countries since the late 1990 including the most recent changes. Policy responses remain remarkably diverse, and in Sweden and Denmark’s cases non-converging, reflecting national philosophies of integration. However, the article also documents a growing salience of a controlling-the-number logic in all three countries, particularly in the wake of 2015 refugee crisis, which increasingly crowds out the politics of <b>civic</b> <b>integration.</b>|$|R

40|$|One of {{the primary}} goals of the Dutch <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policy is the {{emancipation}} of migrant women. Emancipation herein implies both {{the ability to make}} choices about one's personal life and participation in the labour market. However, the content and implementation of the programme fails to meet this goal due to a double bind: migrant women are portrayed as culturally oppressed yet addressed primarily as mothers and voluntary social workers. As such the policy focuses on the former aspects of emancipation while neglecting the later; personal choice and freedom for women are difficult to achieve without financial independence and the sharing of care work between men and women. Using feminist literature on care work and the adult worker model of citizenship we show that <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> needs to be analysed within the Dutch structural and cultural constraints to emancipation that make combining employment and care difficult. Cultural stereotypes of migrant women's supposed oppression serve to obscure these broader Dutch obstacles to emancipation. This analysis relies on a unique combination of qualitative data consisting of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> material, interviews, and non-participant observation in <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> courses.

40|$|Recent {{legislation}} on migration and citizenship in Europe and the EU framework on integration require migrants to meet integration requirements {{in order to}} enter, reside, reunite {{with their families and}} naturalise in the host country. Mandatory language course attendance and examination tests are viewed as means of enhancing integration, which is now framed as a ‘two way’ process or a contractual agreement between migrants and the host society. Despite the deployment of the notion of a <b>contract,</b> <b>integration</b> is, in reality, a one way process aimed at procuring conformity, discipline and migration control. <b>Civic</b> <b>integration</b> rests on an artificial homogenisation and displays the same elements of paternalism and ethnocentricity that characterised past initiatives. The <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> paradigm is a crucial feature of a renewed, albeit old-fashioned, nationpolitics used by political elites to provide answers {{to a wide range of}} issues and to elicit support for a controlling state in the first decade of the 21 st century...|$|R
30|$|So {{why then}} {{do we see}} {{increased}} reliance on general citizenship policies and <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies, despite the rise of liquid mobility? The answer, I would argue, is that many migrants do settle permanently. Contrary {{to the image of}} liquid mobility, we are not all refugees or floating populations. Many migrants settle and become long-term stakeholders in their new society. And so it remains a vital task of a democratic state to figure out the appropriate terms of long-term integration into the host society. Both multiculturalism policies and <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies are a response to that task, but they differ in how they understand the fair terms of integration. According to the study Engbersen himself relies on, the shift from multiculturalism to <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> involves “placing greater responsibility on the individual immigrant for their own integration” (Scholten, Collet, & Petrovic, 2016). Exactly so: the shift from multiculturalism to <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> is not about how best to deal with liquid mobility; it is about how to allocate the burdens and responsibilities of long-term integration. And I would argue that most <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies are simply unfair in the terms of integration they offer (Banting & Kymlicka, 2013). Moreover, as I suggested in my paper, they also tend to reproduce harsh judgements about the deservingness of immigrants, which is a fundamental obstacle to inclusive solidarity. So they are unfair in and of themselves, and have knock-on effects in undermining a sense of mutual obligation.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, then, the {{institutional}} pathways of the Scandinavian welfare states have prevailed {{to some extent}} when confronted with newcomers {{in the area of}} labour market activation which demonstrates how theoretical notions about path dependency are also important in order to grasp how developing trajectories of how <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies are taken place in subareas of the welfare state. However, the developing trajectories are far from unequivocal and this article has only studied one out of several policy areas where <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> is an ongoing process.|$|R
30|$|Engbersen {{acknowledges}} that <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies {{are likely to}} create “specific migrant groups that are in vulnerable positions” and who will face challenges to “enable their transition from non- or partial membership to full social membership”. That is indeed the challenge, and my argument is that coercive <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies worsen the problem, whereas multicultural nationhood can help. Engbersen appears to disagree, but I don’t yet see his argument for rejecting multicultural nationhood, or his alternative to it. In any event, I think the issue of liquid mobility and floating populations {{is a bit of}} a red herring. Insofar as the fundamental policy choice is between multiculturalism policies and <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies, both options lay out the terms of integration for people with the right to stay and to settle long-term, and both need to be evaluated for their intrinsic fairness and for their impact on an ethos of solidarity 5.|$|R
30|$|Accordingly, the {{question}} of whether these typical <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies work can be formulated (at least) in three ways: (1) does civic conditioning further the integration of immigrants?; (2) do <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies screen for less easily integratable immigrants?; (3) do policies reinforce citizens’ own narratives of nationhood? These goals reflect the political reasoning of Western states generally, although, from a normative point of view, it is debatable that states may legitimately use any integration policy, of any degree of restrictiveness, to further them (e.g., Carens, 2013; Miller, 2008).|$|R

I find that while the large majority of Dutch political parties adopt authoritarian positions on the sociocultural axis in favour of state intervention to protect Dutch culture and identity, their positions diverge significantly on the classic economic Left-Right dimension. The most contentious issue in Dutch <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> politics is whether the state, the market or individual migrants should be responsible for financing and organising courses. Thus, this article proposes an innovative model for analysing the politics of citizenship, which enables us to comprehend how citizenship policies are shaped not only by views on how identity and culture relate to social cohesion, but also by diverging perspectives on socio-economic justice...|$|R

30|$|It is {{difficult}} to counter the claim that integration politics in the West {{has given way to}} a liberal-democratic semantic and focus on good citizenship while overtly ethno-nationalist reasoning has been delegitimized.

40|$|Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are all {{examples}} of European {{countries that have}} implemented <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> programs. The diffusion of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> courses, requirements and tests for newcomers reveals a convergent trend in immigration integration policies. This kind of policy requires that newcomers meet integration requirements in order to enter, reside, reunite with their families, enjoy social benefits and naturalize in the host country (Kostakopoulou 2010). Migrants are expected to attend language and citizenship courses and/or to take integration tests after entering in the host country (since 2006 the Netherlands, pioneers in the field, have implemented tests to be taken before and in the home country of the migrants). The immigrant’s failure or non-completion of the program tends to be sanctioned by refusal of a residence permit, financial penalties, a loss of social benefits, etc. The content and structure of these programs vary widely in terms of scope, goals, target groups and institutional actors involved. This diversity mainly derives from the different historical backgrounds, societal models, as well as patterns and traditions of migration flows. However, beyond the factual analysis {{of the content of}} <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> programs, my purpose is to analyze some crucial questions raised by such policies through the lens of political theory. It is a good opportunity to question the conceptual frame underpinning the contemporary <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> discourses. This paper is divided into three parts.

Next, the second section is devoted to an analysis of the consequences of the binding character of such programs, and the ways to monitor the success of a migrant after completing a <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> program. Finally, in the third section I question the real target of such policies: are they aimed at inclusion or exclusion? In conclusion, this paper aims at analyzing the implications of the deep changes experienced by European integration policies.

40|$|In much of {{the western}} world, and {{particularly}} in Europe, {{there is a widespread}} perception that multiculturalism has ‘failed’ and that governments who once embraced a multicultural approach to diversity are turning away, adopting a strong emphasis on <b>civic</b> <b>integration.</b> This reaction, we are told, “reflects a seismic shift not just in the Netherlands, but in other European countries as well” (JOPPKE 2007). This paper challenges this view. Drawing on an updated version of the Multiculturalism Policy Index introduced earlier (BANTING and KYMLICKA 2006), the paper presents an index of the strength of multicultural policies for European countries and several traditional countries of immigration at three points in time (1980, 2000 and 2010). The results paint a different picture of contemporary experience in Europe. While a small number of countries, including most notably the Netherlands, have weakened established multicultural policies during the 2000 s, such a shift is the exception. Most countries that adopted multicultural approaches in the later part of the twentieth century have maintained their programs {{in the first decade of}} the new century; and a significant number of countries have added new ones. In much of Europe, multicultural policies are not in general retreat. As a result, the turn to <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> is often being layered on top of existing multicultural programs, leading to a blended approach to diversity. The paper reflects on the compatibility of multiculturalism policies and <b>civic</b> <b>integration,</b> arguing that more liberal forms of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> can be combined with multiculturalism but that more illiberal or coercive forms are incompatible with a multicultural approach.

30|$|<b>Civic</b> <b>integration</b> {{policies}} {{refer to}} a manifold group of policy areas, including citizenship tests, naturalization ceremonies, language and civic-orientation courses, and modules for role-playing social interaction (Goodman, 2014). The <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> literature has mainly been concerned with policies that serve as gatekeepers for obtaining citizenship and permanent and long-term residence permits. However, it is a main point of this article, that <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> is not restricted to the naturalization trajectory and early integration instruments: The ambition of states to promote functional, individual autonomy {{and to ensure that}} newcomers become ‘good citizens’ is also an important, ongoing process in diverse policy areas of the welfare state, including civic education, childcare services, and labour market activation. Labour market activation policies have been treated very superficially in the civic turn literature; however, at the conceptual as well as the theoretical level, this policy area can be seen {{as part of a broader}} <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> arsenal as there is a clearly connection between the so-called ‘active turn’ emphasizing, on the one hand, active citizenship and a citizen–welfare state relationship with greater emphasis on duties and obligations than rights, and on the other hand ambitions regarding <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> and promoting active and productive participation by immigrants and their commitment to liberal-democratic principles (Goodman, 2012, p. 659). Most notably, Christian Joppke has pointed out how these two tendencies (or phenomena) share an extensive focus on obligations and how both create illiberal temptations: ‘Civic integration is an instance, like eugenics and workfare policies, of illiberal social policy in a liberal state’ (Joppke, 2007, p. 14), and “civic integration” is the equivalent on the part of immigrants to the “workfare” policies that the general population is subjected to in the context of shrinking welfare states (for the latter, see Handler, 2004), seeking to make people both self-sufficient and autonomous by illiberal means’ (Joppke, 2007, p. 16; see also Goodman, 2014, p. 1). In these writing the ‘active turn’ is interpreted as an overall change and practice and as something tantamount to shrinking welfare states. However, the more general labour market literature has demonstrated how activation policies cross-nationally can differ considerably in terms of principles, implementation and policy instruments (e.g. Barbier, 2004).|$|R

30|$|Zapata-Barrero (2017) {{offers an}} {{accurate}} and nuanced {{depiction of the}} dominant political narrative of {{the rise and fall}} of interculturalism and multiculturalism. The diagnostic he poses has three moments: the fall of multiculturalism, the rise of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> and the rise of interculturalism. After enjoying tremendous popularity in the 1990 s, multiculturalism came under attack from both ends of the political spectrum in the 2000 s. The discontent with multiculturalism reached its peak in 2010 when its death was proclaimed by European leaders (Cameron, Merkel and Sarkozy). The dominant discourse claims that multiculturalism celebrates difference but not unity, that it grants rights to immigrants without imposing duties to integrate to the host society, and that it leads to the fragmentation of society by enabling them to live in parallel micro-societies. Two political reactions came out of the proclaimed fall of multiculturalism. On the one hand, a nationalist discourse of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> emerged, promoting a duty-based approach according to which government should enforce the obligation to integrate and to embrace the values of the host societies, mostly through citizenship tests (Goodman, 2010; Joppke, 2007; Joppke, 2012; Joppke, 2017). On the other hand, interculturalism emerged as an allegedly more diversity-friendly discourse refusing both the multicultural fragmentation of society and the nationalistic and coercive overtone of <b>civic</b> <b>integration.</b>|$|R
30|$|Although {{we agree}} with this picture {{of the state of}} the {{political}} discourse on multiculturalism today, we embrace Modood’s (2017) claim that this widespread view is not critical enough of the dominant narratives on multiculturalism. The discourse on the death of multiculturalism, and the accompanying celebration of either <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> or interculturalism, distorts and misrepresents multiculturalism both in theory and in practice. On the one hand, interculturalism and multiculturalism, at least in their liberal-egalitarian variants, share a common normative core at the level of political morality, as they both reject cultural assimilationism and promote the respect of ethnocultural practices compatible with basic liberal democratic principles (Maclure, 2010). In recent years, theoretical accounts multiculturalism have mostly adopted a civic variant of multiculturalism, one that emphasize cross-cultural interactions and dialogue as a way of creating new forms of belonging in diverse societies (Maclure, 2010, p. 41). On the other hand, multiculturalism is not against promoting integration, it seeks to provide immigrants with fair terms of integration (Balint & de Latour, 2013; Kymlicka, 1995). As such, it not incompatible with liberal measures of <b>civic</b> <b>integration,</b> although it severely condemns illiberal projects of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> as assimilationist projects in disguise (Kymlicka, 2012, pp. 15 – 16).|$|R
30|$|Moreover, these <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> {{policies}} arguably bring nationhood {{into the}} story in the wrong way. Nationhood works best when it is deep in the background, as a taken-for-granted presupposition of social life, such that it can indeed be “invisible”. The invisibility of nationhood may be a methodological sin in social science, but it is arguably a social virtue. For when nationhood is highlighted or primed – when it is taken from the back of people’s minds to the front of their minds – there is evidence that it triggers xenophobia. This is one of the results of what are called “mere mention” experiments. In these experiments, one group of respondents is asked “do you believe immigrants deserve this or that right”. Another group of people are asked the same question, but with a national prime: they are asked: “You are Dutch: do you believe immigrants deserve X”. The “mere mention” of nationhood produces systematically harsher answers. 29 Coercive <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies are, in effect, repeated iterations of these mere mention tests: repeatedly poking and prodding immigrants, asking “are you Dutch yet?”. This perhaps explains why the evidence to date suggests that <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies are not overcoming exclusionary forms of solidarity (Goodman & Wright 2015; Gundelach & Traunmüller, 2014).|$|R

In order to analyse this debate, I have selected three national debates in France, Germany and the UK and applied a Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) in order to compare similarities {{and the degree of}} convergence within the European public sphere. The analysis has sought to identify convergence by looking into the shared strategies of discourse through which <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> is articulated, depending on the cultural and political particularities of each national context. The most significant finding to emerge from this study is that Muslims are asked to accept integration with their host countries, through a normative construction of collective identity that cuts across the different national discourses of Europe. These discursive constructions are based on similar definitions of the national values that belong to the European identity and, perhaps more crucially, those that do not belong. Accordingly, the normative and cultural assumptions that underlie various national discourses on <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> are, in fact, based on European universalism, redefined at the national level. At the same time, this debate on integration systematically excludes the important economic and social problems of Muslim newcomers. Specifically, the discourse on <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> avoids reference to any welfare program that attempts to produce economic security and social solidarity; Muslims become exclusively responsible for their own <b>integration</b> and <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> is reduced to only their ability to internalise dominant values. ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this dissertation is that of exploring the relationship between naturalization and <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> from an empirical standpoint. Most existing {{studies have focused on}} the impact of naturalization on the specifically economic dimension of integration, whereas the non-economic aspects have been much more neglected. Here the question of the impact of naturalization is developed with regards to first-generation, third-country nationals (TCNs) residing in Italy, and focusing the attention on <b>civic</b> <b>integration.</b> The latter is provided a working definition characterized by three dimensions (“vertical”, “horizontal” and “subjective”). The research is based on interviews with fifty individuals carried out between 2012 and 2014. Interviews featured both a structured questionnaire and an open-ended talk. The methodology of analysis of the data was both quantitative and qualitative. The objective of mixing the two methods was to enable me, on the one hand, to define the relationship between the “citizenship variable” and the other main ones, and on the other, to gather a deeper understanding the mechanisms at work behind the process of integration in relation to citizenship acquisition. Overall, this research finds that notwithstanding the pervasive effects on the economic, social and political life that globalization, deterritorialization and increased cross-country mobility have had on nation-states and on individuals living within their borders, national citizenship is still a powerful drive in shaping first-generation immigrants’ chances for <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> into the host country.

40|$|Civic integration' {{programmes}} {{and tests}} for third-country nationals (TCNs) have increasingly {{become part of}} member states’ legislation implementing EC immigration law and the EU Framework on <b>Integration.</b> The <b>civic</b> dimension of <b>integration</b> consists of various programmes and tests requiring TCNs to demonstrate that they know and respect the receiving society’s history, institutions and values. This paper assesses the tensions inherent {{in the relationship between}} <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> programmes and the principles of legal certainty, proportionality and non-discrimination. This paper compares national immigration legislation in four member states – Denmark, France, Germany and the Netherlands. It studies the personal and material scope of <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> provisions as well as the political justifications promulgated by their governments for introducing these kinds of policies. This comparison enables us to identify the common deficits of these member states’ policies. We argue that by providing a supranational venue for the transferring and legitimising certain national policies that use <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> to restrict immigration, the legitimacy and coherency of the EU immigration policy is profoundly affected by the same deficits. The consequences endanger some of the key principles upon which the EU legal system and its immigration policy have been built. That notwithstanding, we conclude that owing to the progressive Europeanisation of immigration policy, member states are no longer free to use integration as a derogative clause for TCNs to have access to rights and protection in the EU...|$|R

30|$|The {{measures}} mostly {{associated with}} <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> – integration requirements for entry, permanent residence and naturalization – are often justified as ways to incentivize and motivate immigrants to acquire certain capacities, attitudes and knowledge {{that allows them}} to participate in the labor market, civil society and democracy. However, as many studies show, integration requirements also serve as a civic screening mechanism to keep out those (potential) immigrants who are more difficult to integrate (Goodman, 2011; Groenendijk, 2011; Van Oers, Ersbøll, & Kostakopoulou, 2010). Finally, <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies may have symbolic goals, e.g. to signal to host populations, either that the competence and ability of governments to control the country’s borders, or their concern to maintain and strengthen cultural cohesion and national identity (Goodman & Wright, 2015, p. 1891; Permoser, 2012).|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the gendered and racist {{dimensions of the}} ‘assimilationist turn’ of current <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies for immigrants. It does so {{by looking at the}} intersections between family law and current <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> legislations in two specific countries: France and the Netherlands. In both the French and the Dutch case, the content of the <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> material regarding gender equality and women’s rights focuses especially on the family. In France, such a focus was strongly advocated by the High Council for Integration (HCI – Haut Conseil a l’integration), according to which one of the most pressing problems that migrant women face is the fact that “the application of the law of nationality in matters of personal status and bilateral agreements limit women's rights. ” The position of the HCI reflects a common trope in Western discussions on legal pluralism and its consequences for minorities and women’s rights, one within which gender oppression and gender violence are related to religious law with the effect of producing a binary opposition between culture and religion, on the one hand, and human rights and gender equality on the other. However, I argue that, not unlike the recent ban of the Muslim headscarf from French public schools, whose fundamental racism has been traced back to the history of French colonialism, the fixation on family norms as evident in integration policies is animated by a similar colonial anxiety. In the Netherlands the right-wing nationalist Minister Rita Verdonk – the main initiator of the <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> turn in the country – defended the <b>civic</b> <b>integration</b> policies as aimed to defend Dutch progressive norms regarding sexuality and women’s rights from backward family values. As Sarah van Walsum aptly notes, “in linking exotic family norms and immigration to formulate a compound threat to the Dutch nation, Minister Verdonk gave vent to anxieties whose roots ran deeper than the above named moments of religiously inspired violence could account for. Her words were in fact strikingly reminiscent (…) of the discourse used in colonial times to distinguish the Dutch, legally defined as ‘European’, from the ‘native’ inhabitants of the former Dutch East Indies” (van Walsum 2008 : 6). In the end, this article seeks to demonstrate how the “normative” side of integration policies and preparation materials – and, within them, the mobilisation of women’s rights – is an expression of a nationalist and racist register, as well as of a colonial legacy...|$|R
