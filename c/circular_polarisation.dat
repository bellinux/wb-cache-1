40|$|Cosmic ray {{acceleration}} through first-order Fermi acceleration in a {{collisionless plasma}} relies on efficient scattering off magnetic field fluctuations. Scattering is most efficient for magnetic field fluctuations with wavelengths {{on the order}} of the gyroradius of the particles. In order to determine the highest energy to which cosmic rays can be accelerated, {{it is important to understand}} the growth of the magnetic field on these large scales. We derive the growth rate of the long-wavelength fluctuations in the linear regime, using the kinetic equation coupled to Maxwell's equations for the background plasma.

Leeson's goniometer, to be fitted to a microscope eyepiece, was illustrated in Knight's New Mechanical Dictionary (1884); and its measurement technique, by bringing two images of a crystal into coincidence, was still explained in a text of 1921.

For satellite Internet services in tropical areas with heavy rain, use of the C band (4/6 GHz) with a <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> satellite is popular.

50|$|An LNB {{can only}} handle a single receiver. This {{is due to}} the fact that the LNB is mapping two {{different}} <b>circular</b> <b>polarisations</b> - right hand and left hand - and in the case of the Ku-band two different reception bands - lower and upper - to one and the same frequency band on the cable, and is a practical problem for home satellite reception. Depending on which frequency a transponder is transmitting at and on what polarisation it is using, the satellite receiver has to switch the LNB into one of four different modes in order to receive a specific desired program on a specific transponder. The receiver uses the DiSEqC protocol to control the LNB mode, which handles this. If several satellite receivers are to be attached to a single dish a so-called multiswitch must be used in conjunction with a special type of LNB. There are also LNBs available with a multiswitch already integrated. This problem becomes more complicated when several receivers use several dishes or several LNBs mounted in a single dish are aimed at different satellites.|$|R

We estimate that the time lag between the arrival times of the left and right circularly polarised light signals from pulsars. If the light propagates through a hot plasma (where the temperature in some regions is T ∼ 100 MeV) then the time lag between the two circularly polarised signals of frequency ω will be Δ t(ω) ≃ 10 ^- 6 /ω.

50|$|When the helix {{circumference}} is {{near the}} wavelength of operation, the antenna operates in axial mode. This is a nonresonant traveling wave mode, in which instead of standing waves, the waves of current and voltage travel in one direction, up the helix. Instead of radiating linearly polarized waves normal to the antenna's axis, it radiates a beam of radio waves with <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> along the axis, off {{the ends of the}} antenna. The main lobes of the radiation pattern are along the axis of the helix, off both ends.

50|$|The helix in {{the antenna}} can twist in two {{possible}} directions: right-handed or left-handed, {{as defined by}} the right-hand rule. In an axial-mode helical antenna the direction of twist of the helix determines the polarisation of the radio waves. Two mutually incompatible conventions are in use for describing waves with <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation,</b> so the relationship between the handedness (left or right) of a helical antenna, and the type of circularly-polarised radiation it emits cannot be stated without ambiguity. Helical antennas can receive signals with any type of linear polarisation, such as horizontal or vertical polarisation, but when receiving circularly polarised signals the handedness of the receiving antenna must be the same as the transmitting antenna; left-hand polarised antennas suffer a severe loss of gain when receiving right-circularly-polarised signals, and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture utilising polarisation diversity {{to increase the}} capacity of high-frequency (HF) radio links through the ionospheric channel. A summary of physics focuses on the polarisation of radio waves propagated in the ionosphere.

This solution enables a reduction of the inter antenna spacing which is convenient {{in the context of}} decametric wavelengths. Simulations, referring to the theoretical expression of channel capacity and involving realistic models of ionospheric radio links, underline a significant increase in performances for this particular MIMO structure if compared to a single-input single-output system.

The Hα-line profiles of linear polarisation are shown to be affected by electron beams in the line cores whereas wings are fully depolarised by thermal electrons. The full Hα-line linear polarisation, caused by weak or moderate electron beams, is shown to be 2 − 20 % and either positive or negative depending on time after the beam onset and on depth in the atmosphere. The plane of polarisation in the Hα-line is normally perpendicular to the direction of electron beam propagation. Depending on a viewing angle it can be either parallel or perpendicular to the flare-to-solar centre direction.

40|$|Group {{theoretical}} {{techniques are}} used to analyse the polarisation dependence of multiphoton processes. The analysis is sufficiently general {{to be applied to}} all point group symmetries and {{in a wide variety of}} physical situations. For two photon spectroscopy, a method is developed for extracting the maximum information available from polarisation studies. It is shown that measurements involving <b>circular</b> <b>polarisations</b> of the light beams are always required to determine all the parameters contributing to the intensities. Detailed results are given for the case of time reversal even interactions for electric dipole coupling. The analysis is applied to non resonant vibrational Raman scattering in the presence of degenerate electronic states. Existing selection rules are extended allowing a proof that symmetric and antisymmetric amplitude terms do not interfere. Complete tables of selection rules are given for both oriented and random scatterers. Non linear effects are also considered. Diagram techniques provide an efficient method for separating the geometrical factors which contribute to the hyper Raman scattering intensity. New symmetry restrictions are postulated for the four photon C. A. R. S. process. Handed effects are also considered and in particular natural and induced circular dichroism. Both the M. C. D. and E.

50|$|In {{order to}} allow a good night-time {{transmission}} without causing too many problems with electromagnetic influence, a cross-dipole antenna with a radiation maximum pointing vertically into the sky was built in early 2006. This antenna, {{which is one of}} the few applications of <b>circular</b> <b>polarisation</b> for broadcasting, is mounted on 5 guyed masts. The central mast of this antenna is grounded. It carries the feeder cables running to the dipole, while the masts at the edge are standing on insulators and grounded via inductances in such way that they radiate as low a frequency as possible. In this way, undesired parasitic radiations, which are the cause of electromagnetic influence, are suppressed. It is also interesting to know that the radiated wave must be right-hand polarized, otherwise the signal reflected on the ionosphere would be 20 dB less strong. In spring 2006 this new antenna went into service. It is used only for night-time transmissions, as the desired ionospheric reflection occurs only at night. During the day the old mast is used.|$|E

These mount types may become more widely spread as they have several advantages, particularly for geodetic observatories. Multi-band observations, with multiple receivers, can only be fitted into telescopes with Nasmyth feeds. These are the requirements for the new generation of geodetic arrays as discussed in IVS 2010. Further more the next generation of antennae will also be required to have very high slew rates, and these can be achieved with the E-W mount. The mount type affects the differential phase between {{the left and the right}} hand <b>circular</b> <b>polarisations</b> (LHC and RHC) for different points on the sky.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the optical spectroscopic measurements of III-V semiconductors used {{to investigate a}} number of issues related to the development of integrated quantum optical circuits. The disorder-limited propagation of photons in photonic crystal waveguides in the slow-light regime is investigated. The analysis of Fabry-Perot resonances is used to map the mode dispersion and extract the photon localisation length. Andersonlocalised modes are observed at high group indices, when the localisation lengths are shorter than the waveguide lengths, consistent with the Fabry-Perot analysis. A spin-photon interface based on two orthogonal waveguides is introduced, where the polarisation emitted by a quantum dot is mapped to a path-encoded photon. Operation is demonstrated by deducing the spin using the interference of in-plane photons. A second device directly maps right and left <b>circular</b> <b>polarisations</b> to anti-parallel waveguides, surprising for a non-chiral structure but consistent with an off-centre dot. Two dimensional photonic crystal cavities in GaInP and full control over the spontaneous emission rate of InP quantum dots is demonstrated by spectrally tuning the exciton emission energy into resonance with the fundamental cavity mode. Fourier transform spectroscopy is used to investigate the short coherence times of InP quantum dots in GaInP photonic crystal cavities.

40|$|Humans {{are fascinated}} by the colour vision, colour signals and ‘dress codes’ of other animals {{as we can see}} colour. This {{property}} of light may be useful for increasing the contrast of objects during foraging, defence, camouflage and sexual communication. New research, largely from the last decade, now suggests that polarisation is a quality of light also used in signalling and may contain information at least as rich as colour. As many of the chapters in this book detail, polarisation in animals is often associated with navigation, habitat choice and other tasks that require large-field processing. That is, a wide area of the light field, such as the celestial hemisphere, is sampled from. Polarisation vision that recognises and extracts information from objects is most likely confined to processing through small numbers of receptors. This chapter examines the latest evidence on polarised signals from animals and their environments, including both linear and <b>circular</b> <b>polarisations.</b> Both aquatic and terrestrial examples are detailed, but with emphasis on life underwater as it is here that many recent discoveries have been made.
