40|$|The C-type lectin-like receptor, CLEC- 2, is constitutively {{expressed}} on platelets, with reported {{expression on}} a number of leukocyte subsets in adult mice. Constitutive or platelet-specific deletion of CLEC- 2 in mice induces <b>cerebral</b> <b>haemorrhaging</b> by midgestation. In this thesis, I investigated the basis of this defect, hypothesising that it is mediated by the loss of CLEC- 2 activation by its endogenous ligand, podoplanin, expressed on the developing neural tube. Podoplaninfl/fl mice were crossed to mice expressing PGK-Cre to induce deletion of podoplanin at the two-cell stage. Developing blood vessels were visualized by 3 -dimensional microscopy and found to be aberrantly patterned in CLEC- 2 - and podoplanin-deficient mice, culminating in widespread <b>cerebral</b> <b>haemorrhaging</b> by mid-gestation. Haemorrhages were also observed following Nestin-Cre driven deletion of podoplanin on neural progenitors and following deletion of the platelet integrin, αIIbβ 3. Together these studies support that neuro-epithelial-derived podoplanin interacts with platelet-CLEC- 2 to guide the maturation and integrity of the cerebral vasculature and to prevent haemorrhage by stimulating platelet aggregation. Using tamoxifen-inducible deletion of CLEC- 2 in adult mice, the expression profile of CLEC- 2 was investigated and shown to be restricted to platelets and circulating B-lymphocytes and CD 11 bhigh Gr 1 high myeloid cells. Furthermore, loss of CLEC- 2 in adult mice was shown to be dispensable for maintaining blood-brain barrier permeability...|$|R

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{can only be}} made in the presence of confirmed liver disease (types A and C) or a portosystemic shunt (type B), as its symptoms are similar to those encountered in other encephalopathies. To make the distinction, abnormal liver function tests and/or ultrasound suggesting liver disease are required, and ideally liver biopsy. The symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy may also arise from other conditions, such as <b>cerebral</b> <b>haemorrhage</b> and seizures (both of which are more common in chronic liver disease). A CT scan of the brain may be required to exclude haemorrhage, and if seizure activity is suspected an electroencephalograph (EEG) study may be performed. Rarer mimics of encephalopathy are meningitis, encephalitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy and Wilson's disease; these may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed with investigations.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cerebral {{cavernous}} malformations (CCMs) are vascular lesions {{characterized by}} abnormally enlarged capillary cavities without intervening brain parenchyma. Although often asymptomatic, seizures, <b>cerebral</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> and focal neurological deficits are well-documented complications. Mutations in the CCM 1 (7 q 21 - 22), CCM 2 (7 p 13 - 15) and CCM 3 (3 q 25. 2 - 27) genes {{have been identified}} in familial CCM. In rare instances, the association of congenital hyperkeratotic cutaneous capillary-venous malformations (HCCVMs) with CCM 1 has been reported. OBSERVATIONS: We studied 6 members of a family with CCMs. Four members of the family developed late-onset multiple, tiny, bluish, soft, cutaneous papules, mainly located on the face, arm and abdominal area, corresponding histologically to venous malformations. A splice donor site mutation in intron 4 (c. 1146 + 1 G [...] >A) in the CCM 1 gene was identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that mutations in the KRIT 1 gene may cause phenotypically heterogeneous cutaneous vascular lesions other than those previously described as HCCVMs...|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} guideline for {{the treatment}} of ischemic stroke, issued by the Dutch College of General Practitioners, is a timely and most welcome update. It incorporates the new evidence and the important changes in stroke treatment of the past years, and is a good starting point for the collaboration between general practitioners and neurologists in the care of patients with a cerebrovascular accident. The guideline acknowledges the evidence for the benefit ofthrombolysis, but is somewhat vague concerning the magnitude of the effect because it compares the net effect of treatment (which incorporates the risk of bleeding) and the number of <b>cerebral</b> <b>haemorrhages.</b> Furthermore, the discussion of minor stroke could lead to the erroneous conclusion that such patients can be safely cared for at home. Apart from these reservations, the guideline fully agrees with the need to treat all patients with a cerebral infarct, in the absence of contraindications, with thrombolysis within three hours, and to offer specialised care in a dedicated stroke-uni...|$|R

40|$|Cerebral {{cavernous}} malformation (CCM) is a vascular malformation causing neurological problems, such as headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and <b>cerebral</b> <b>haemorrhages.</b> CCMs {{can occur}} sporadically {{or as an}} autosomal dominant condition with variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Familial forms {{have been linked to}} three chromosomal loci, and loss of function mutations have been identified in the KRIT 1 / CCM 1, MGC 4607 /CCM 2, and PDCD 10 /CCM 3 genes. Recently, many new pieces of data {{have been added to the}} CCM puzzle. It has been shown that the three CCM genes are expressed in neurones rather than in blood vessels. The interaction between CCM 1 and CCM 2, which was expected on the basis of their structure, has also been proven, suggesting a common functional pathway. Finally, in a large series of KRIT 1 mutation carriers, clinical and neuroradiological features have been characterised. These data should lead to more appropriate follow up, treatment, and genetic counselling. The recent developments will also help to elucidate the precise pathogenic mechanisms leading to CCM, contributing to a better understanding of normal and pathological angiogenesis and to the development of targeted treatment.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the cause of}} death during a 12 -month period (1995 / 96) in all consecutive patients admitted to hospital with leptospiral infection in Seychelles (Indian Ocean), where the disease is endemic. Leptospirosis was diagnosed by use of the microscopic agglutination test and a specific polymerase chain reaction assay on serum samples. Seventy-five cases were diagnosed and 6 patients died, a case fatality of 8 %. All 6 patients died within 9 days of onset of symptoms and within 2 days of admission for 5 of them (5 days for the 6 th). On autopsy, diffuse bilateral pulmonary haemorrhage (PH) was found in all fatalities. Renal, cardiac, digestive and <b>cerebral</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> were also found in 5, 3, 3 and 1 case(s), respectively. Incidentally, haemoptysis and lung infiltrate on chest radiographs, which suggest PH, were found in 8 of the 69 non-fatal cases. Dengue and hantavirus infections were ruled out.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} costs to the Spanish {{healthcare}} system of 35 days' treatment with triflusal (600 mg/day) and aspirin (300 mg/day) in patients with confirmed acute myocardial infarction within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. Design: A cost minimisation analysis {{based on the results}} of the Triflusal in Acute Myocardial Infarction study (TIM) was conducted. The hypothesis was that despite a higher acquisition cost of triflusal, savings would result because of differences in efficacy and safety outcome (non-fatal cerebrovascular event and haemorrhagic events). Diagnostic Related Groups were used as a proxy for determining hospital costs in Spain and the values were obtained from different sources and refer to year 2000 costs. Only direct medical costs were considered for the economic analysis. Results: Although the acquisition cost of triflusal was more expensive than that of aspirin, the cost of prevented events - non-fatal ischaemic cerebrovascular events and <b>cerebral</b> <b>haemorrhages</b> - entirely compensated for the cost of triflusal. The overall cost of treating patients with triflusal, compared with aspirin, represented a net saving of 28. 4 % per patient treated.

40|$|The dense-cored plaques are {{considered}} the pathogenic type of amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease brains because of their predominant association with dystrophic neurites. Nevertheless, in > 90 % of cases of Alzheimer's disease amyloid is also deposited in cerebral blood vessel walls (congophilic amyloid angiopathy; CAA) but its role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis remains enigmatic. Here, we report a family (family GB) in which early-onset Alzheimer's disease {{was caused by a}} novel presenilin 1 mutation (L 282 V). This was unusually severe CAA reminiscent of the Flemish amyloid precursor protein (A 692 G) mutation we reported previously, which causes Alzheimer's disease and/or <b>cerebral</b> <b>haemorrhages.</b> In family GB, however, the disease presented as typical progressive Alzheimer's disease in the absence of strokes or stroke-like episodes. Similarly, neuroimaging studies and neuropathological examination favoured a degenerative over a vascular dementia. Interestingly, an immunohistochemical study revealed that, similar to causing dense-cored amyloid plaques, CAA also appeared capable of instigating a strong local dystrophic and inflammatory reaction. This was suggested by the observed neuronal loss, the presence of tau- and ubiquitin-positive neurites, micro- and astrogliosis, and complement activation. Together, these data suggest that, like the dense-cored neuritic plaques, CAA might represent a pathogenic lesion that contributes significantly to the progressive neurodegeneration that occurs in Alzheimer's disease. status: publishe...|$|R
