The slider crank mechanism is simulated in ADAMS software to observe {{the response of the}} slider block and the reaction forces at joint R 2 (joint between crank shaft and connecting rod).

Then these samples were tested in an MTS Insight 30 compression testing machine to study the trends of the yield process with different structure sizes. A set of standard cylinder samples were also designed according to the Chinese GB/T 228 - 2010 standard. These samples, which were made of iron-nickel alloy (IN 718), were also processed by SLM, and then tested in the universal material testing machine INSTRON 1346 to obtain their tensile strength. Furthermore, a lightweight redesigned method was researched. Then some common parts such as a stopper and <b>connecting</b> <b>plate</b> were redesigned using this method.

40|$|Many {{analyses}} {{show that}} concrete and pre-stressed concrete bridges {{tend to be}} more economical than steel bridges using conventional construction methods. Construction and material cost are two major factors that can affect the total cost of a bridge construction project. Since no control can be taken over material costs, any response must focus on the design and construction methods of steel bridges through reduction of labor and equipment costs. The simple-made-continuous system is one such response. This method can enhance the competitiveness of the short to medium span steel bridges. The simple-made-continuous method causes girder and slab dead loads to be resisted as in a simple span, while the superimposed dead loads and live loads are resisted as in continuous spans. ^ Three different connections were proposed for the conventional method of construction. Three experimental full scale specimens were conducted to investigate the behavior of the proposed connection during fatigue and ultimate loading. ABAQUS 6. 9 was employed to model the experimental specimens to find the resistance mechanism of the connections. ^ Following successful test results, an accelerated type of connection was proposed {{as a response to the}} public demand to reduce on-site construction time and mitigate long traffic delays. This connection was similar to the conventional type connection by modifying the system for the accelerated construction method. In the accelerated construction method, each span is built separately and then connected using the proposed connection to achieve a full continuity during the service life of the structure. ^ A full scale specimen of a connection using the accelerated method was built in the structural laboratory to investigate the behavior of the specimen. The connection experienced four million cycles during the fatigue test. Following the fatigue test, an ultimate load test was conducted to investigate the failure mechanism of the connection. The experimental tests results are studied to observe the performance of the new connections. A few FEM models are developed to simulate the connections and investigate the load resistance mechanism of the connections in more detail. ^ Due to the high percentage of skew bridges in the United States, finite element models are developed to investigate the performance of the new connections for skew bridges. ^ The results of experimental tests and FEM models reveal that longitudinal rebars at top of the diaphragm have the most contribution in the resistance mechanism in tension. Also, steel block, concrete, and <b>connecting</b> <b>plate</b> have the most contribution in the resistance mechanism in compression. In the skew bridges, a lateral force is created from the lateral component of the compression force that can be resisted by the steel plates perpendicular to the lateral force. ^ By understanding the resistance mechanism of the connections, a design provision is developed to address the design needs for the bridge designer for both non-skew and skew bridges using two different methods of construction. ...|$|E
40|$|Vibration {{attenuation}} at junctions {{of point}} <b>connected</b> <b>plates</b> {{is an important}} aspect of structure-borne sound transmission in many realistic structures. The vibrational response of point <b>connected</b> <b>plates</b> can be predicted using statistical energy analysis (SEA), where coupling loss factors are calculated based on mobility formulations. However, in the process of deriving the coupling loss factors for point connected systems, a number of assumptions and simplifications were introduced. In this paper, a more advanced calculation model, based on a wave approach for elastically coupled semi-infinite plates, is presented. Local rigid connections are modeled using an elastic interlayer characterized by a space-dependent stiffness. Periodic boundary conditions are assumed at the junction and the plate response is described using a Fourier decomposition technique. Calculation results obtained for two different junction geometries demonstrate the influence of the distance between the point connections on the structure-borne sound transmission. Finally, a comparison between a number of numerical and experimental results illustrates the ability of the model to predict the influence of the density and the width of the point connections with good accuracy.

40|$|The article {{represents}} a summarized {{research of the}} influence of thickness of elements connected by multiple-bolt friction joints produced onto the bearing ability of the connection. Different thicknesses of structural elements connected by multiple-bolt friction joints produce both qualitative and quantitative influence on the stress-strain state of the connection. The relevance of the research is driven by the technology of Light Steel Framing Construction (LSFC) that is intensively developed and implemented in the construction industry. The objectives of the research encompass: the experimental study {{of the influence of}} the thickness or thickness difference of connected elements produced onto the bearing capacity of friction joints; identification of the bearing capacity of high-strength bolts with controlled tension in the bolted connection, depending on the thickness of connected elements. The results of experimental tests of samples of <b>connected</b> <b>plates,</b> the thicknesses of which vary from 1. 5 mm to 5 mm, are presented in the paper.
