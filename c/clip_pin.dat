5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} characteristic is the position of the body in grave pit. Deceased were buried always in north-south alignment, with head south facing east. The body lied in a grave usually in slightly contracted position. Exceptions from this rule are sporadic.In classic phase (approx. 1850-1750 BC), Úněticean burial rite displays strong uniformity, regardless of the gender or age of the deceased. Men and women were buried in the same N-S position. The grave goods consisted of ceramic vessels (usually 1-5), bronze items (jewellery and private belongings, rings, hair <b>clips,</b> <b>pins</b> etc.), bone artifacts (amulets and tools, i.e. needles), occasionally flint tools (e.g. burial of Archer from Nowa Wieś Wrocławska buried with colour flint arrowheads).A body deposited within a grave might have been protected with organic mats or a coffin, but in the majority of cases there was no additional coverage of the corpse. Well known example of wicker-made coffin inhumation derives from Bruszczewo fortified settlement, nearby Poznań in Greater Poland. In approximately 20% of burials, stone settings were found. Erection of a full stone setting or just a partial one (a few stones in the corners of grave) seems to be quite a common practice observed in all phases of the EBA in Central Europe.Wooden coffins were discovered at several sites in e.g. Lower Silesia. The Únětice culture coffin burials can be divided in two types, equipped with: ...|$|R

Daggerboards are usually found in small sailing craft such as day sailers, which are easily handled by a single person. Daggerboards are not usually ballasted but are locked in place by a <b>clip</b> or <b>pin.</b> Unlike a centreboard, which can be set at different angles to the hull of the boat, daggerboards are generally limited to a single perpendicular position relative to the hull. If a daggerboard is located off center, it is called a leeboard or a bilgeboard.|$|R

30|$|A {{total of}} 31 soil samples were {{collected}} with Stratified Random Sampling Method (SRSM) in different classified zones of which 29 {{samples were collected}} along the both new banks of the new channel excluding 2 samples from natural unaffected area. Out of these samples, 11 samples were collected from RZ including 5 samples into the new channel starting from the breach point which was further classified as Central Red Zone (CRZ). Similarly, 10 and 8 samples were collected from YZ and GZ respectively. Grain size analysis was conducted for the sediments with standard ASTM method. The analysis was conducted to determine the sediment size distribution and texture of the flood sediments over the agricultural land. Five gram sample was examined by binocular magnifier (20 ×). For this examination, mineral grains were separated by <b>clip</b> and <b>pin</b> for the counting and identification of the minerals.|$|R

Magnetic backings, because they do not puncture clothing with pins, have recently become more popular for name tags. Some name tags are worn around the neck using a lanyard or necklace.|$|R
5000|$|The Gun Control Act of 1968 {{prohibited}} {{the import of}} HK33 (as well as HK53) rifles for civilian ownership in the U.S. because of their status as machine guns. As a result, a number of HK93s (and possibly {{a small number of}} HK43s) were used as hosts for full-auto conversions for civilians who wished to own an HK33/53 select fire rifle. Up until the passage of the McClure-Volkmer Act, a Class II manufacturer could convert an HK93 in one of two ways. He could either drill a hole in the receiver to accommodate the attachment of a push-pin style [...] "S-E-F" [...] grip frame housing, or he could modify a semi-auto trigger pack and use a <b>clipped</b> and <b>pinned</b> [...] "S-E-F" [...] grip frame housing. The flapper/paddle magazine release was usually installed on these rifles {{at the time of their}} conversion for added authenticity. Sometimes, the receivers were even remarked or restamped to say [...] "HK33" [...] or [...] "HK53". For an HK53 conversion, a gunsmith had to cut the barrel of an HK93 down to 8.3 inches and re-thread the muzzle.|$|R

The Stroker is made of a metal exterior, with Teflon coated interior to reduce friction, and <b>clips</b> or <b>pins</b> that provide expandability. Innovation – Prototype development offers several opportunities to find innovative design solutions to improve and address the goals of the product. Although a rudimentary prototype has been developed as part of the concept development process, it is not a functional prototype that can be tested to determine if indeed the design meets the standards developed by the product development team. Two major challenges have to be addressed. The prototype can help ensure that the design is the best method of expanding/contracting of the components rapidly that provides stability, limits friction to a minimum, and is durable enough for casual use. Secondly, developing a prototype will provide additional insight into the development of the most costs effective manufacturing process. Thirdly, this is a lifestyle product and as such, industrial design is critical to its success. What design elements will be most appealing to the greatest percentage of our target market? Will a simple metal exterior, with perhaps engraving or patterns meet our needs, or should we consider a wide range of designs with a variety of exteriors such as painting, colors, etc...|$|R

50|$|With outdoor performances, {{users of}} music stands can face {{challenges}} due to wind blowing {{the pages of}} sheet music off the stand or blowing the pages to an incorrect page. To resolve this challenge, performers use metal <b>clips</b> or clothes <b>pins</b> {{on the sides of}} the music or lay a sheet of plexiglass over the stand. While these methods prevent the music or pages from being blown by the wind, they make page turns more difficult. As well, users of lightweight folding stand may face challenges on windy days, as the opened pages of a music part may act like a sail and catch the wind, which can lead to the entire stand blowing over. Heavy-duty folded stands, and professional stands are less likely to blow over in outdoor concerts, due to their greater weight. In outdoor concerts where windy conditions are a problem, the most wind-resistant stand is a professional, non-folding stand with a heavy, weighted base.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{security}} risk of a commercial aircraft, passengers are not allowed to take certain items in their carry-on baggage. For this reason, human operators are trained to detect prohibited items using a manually controlled baggage screening process. The inspection process, however, is highly complex as hazardous items are very difficult to detect when placed in close packed bags, superimposed by other objects, and/or rotated showing an unrecognizable profile. In this paper, we review certain advances achieved by our research group in this field. Our methodology is based on multiple view analysis, because it can be a powerful tool for examining complex objects in cases in which uncertainty can lead to misinterpretation. In our approach, multiple views (taken from fixed points of view, or using an active vision approach in which the best views are automated selected) are analyzed in the detection of regular objects. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, experimental results on recognizing guns, razor blades, <b>pins,</b> <b>clips</b> and springs in baggage inspection are presented achieving around 90 % accuracy. We believe that {{it would be possible to}} design an automated aid in a target detection task using the proposed algorithm. 1...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the article}} we will {{describe}} {{the use of}} a simple, reproducible and practical urinary catheter model for tendon repair simulation. The structure of the model gives a satisfactory imitation of a tendon's texture, contour and flexibility. This model is easily stored and disposed of. It is free of any ethical committee restrictions. In addition, it can be reused and is easy to handle. There are no disease transmission risks and one catheter can be divided into multiple segments such that several trainees can use one catheter at any one time, therefore saving on costs. In addition, different techniques can be performed on the same model. Tendon repair is an important surgical skill to be attained by all core surgical trainees; especially in Plastic and Orthopedic Surgery. However, tendon repair simulation materials can be relatively expensive. In the Basic Surgical Skills Course®, trainees learn tendon repair techniques using a pig's trotter. The caveat to this is the difficulty in obtaining animal models, and ethical dilemmas that this presents. A simple, effective and cheap method to practice tendon repair techniques is by dividing a Urinary Catheter into multiple pieces, which can be secured to cardboard or perspex using <b>clips,</b> staples, or <b>pins.</b> The Catheter thus simulates a divided tendon, providing a pragmatic medium for practice. The two ends can be opposed and repaired with various suture techniques. Trainees will be able to practice different repair techniques, surgical skills as well as basic surgical principles. The surgical skills include the handling of tissues and instruments effectively and safely, disposal of sharps, suture choice and use, suturing technique and knot tying and surgical dexterity. Principles that can be demonstrated during the simulation session include planning operative approach and choosing appropriate instruments...|$|R
5000|$|In an unreported Indiana case, Sprecher wrote, a three-judge {{district}} court panel {{had found a}} more detailed ordinance too vague {{in the use of}} the similar phrase [...] "designed for use with drugs" [...] since many legal items could be used, or easily altered for use, as drug delivery devices. He read the guidelines written for Hoffman Estates ordinance by the village attorney as using [...] "designed" [...] to denote [...] "those items which are inherently suited only for drug use, and are thus covered by the ordinance regardless of the manner of display or avowed intent of the retailer." [...] However, even in one case where the guidelines left no room for interpretation based on the latter, the guidelines were insufficient. For example, the guidelines state that [...] "roach clips" [...] are [...] "designed for use with illegal cannabis or drugs and therefore covered" ... But the guidelines do not define [...] "roach clip." [...] Consequently, stocking any item that could possibly be used as a roach clip, such as an alligator <b>clip</b> or bobby <b>pin,</b> could subject a retailer to the licensing requirement. In reality, it is inconceivable that sale of these innocent items would subject a hardware store or drugstore to the burdens of the license fee and sales register, as well as to the label of [...] "drug paraphernalia store." [...] Perhaps the village wishes to draw a line between items which inherently are roach clips and [...] "innocent" [...] items merely used as roach clips. But neither the ordinance nor the guidelines draws this distinction, and we are uncertain as to whether any definition of a roach clip could draw such a distinction based on design alone.|$|R

Edith Neumann was born Editha Spitzer in Vienna on May 26, 1902, the youngest child of the lawyer and art collector Alfred Spitzer and his wife Hermine. She had an elder sister named Hanna (Hansi). Edith Spitzer studied chemistry and physics at the University of Vienna and received her doctorate in 1927; at that time {{she was the only}} woman studying such subjects there. In 1924 she converted to Christianity, and in May 1925 became engaged to Friedrich (Fritz) Neumann, who was also a Christian convert. In 1938 the couple, fearing the arrest of Friedrich Neumann, fled Vienna via the Danube, finally arriving in London {{with the help of the}} British Society. In 1948 the Neumanns immigrated to the United States, where they settled in New York. Friedrich, now Frederick (Fred) Neumann became the pastor of the Bushwick Congregational Church in Brooklyn, a position he remained at until his death. Edith Neumann worked as a bacteriologist at the Jewish Hospital in Brooklyn, then received a position as microbiologist at Maimonides Hospital, remaining there for the next 20 years. After the death of Frederick Neumann in 1967, Edith Neumann moved to Manhattan and took a job as medical director of the Jetti Katz Clinical Laboratory. In 1982 she retired at the age of eighty. In 1983 she established the Frederick Neumann Memorial Lecture at Princeton Theological Seminary. Edith Neumann donated several paintings from her father's collection to institutions in Vienna.
