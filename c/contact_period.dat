Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.|$|E

The potential for callers to convey their motivational state may ensure that recipient responses are appropriate to their needs. The current study investigated the influence of behavioural context on Weddell seal mother-pup vocalisation. Mother and pup call rates were calculated within five and seven behavioural contexts, respectively, and the acoustic characteristics of 69 pup calls were measured within four contexts (total calls = 276). Context significantly influenced the temporal patterning of calls, with reuniting mothers and pups and lone active pups emitting more calls than during mother-pup <b>contact</b> <b>periods.</b> Reuniting and lone pup calls were also characterised by longer durations, higher fundamental frequencies, and increased energy in upper harmonics.

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the biosurfactants surfactin and rhamnolipids on the adhesion of the food pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Enterobacter sakazakii and Salmonella Enteritidis to stainless steel and polypropylene surfaces. Methods and Results: Quantification of bacterial adhesion was performed using the crystal violet staining technique. Preconditioning of surfaces with surfactin caused a reduction on the number of adhered cells of Ent. sakazakii and L. monocytogenes on stainless steel. The most significant result was obtained with L. monocytogenes where number of adhered cells was reduced by 10 (2) CFU cm(- 2). On polypropylene, surfactin showed a significant decrease on the adhesion of all strains. The adsorption of surfactin on polystyrene also reduces the adhesion of L. monocytogenes and Salm. Enteritidis growing cells. For short <b>contact</b> <b>periods</b> using nongrowing cells or longer <b>contact</b> <b>periods</b> with growing cells, surfactin was able to delay bacterial adhesion. Conclusions: The prior adsorption of surfactin to solid surfaces contributes on reducing colonization of the pathogenic bacteria. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first work investigating the effect of surfactin on the adhesion of the food pathogens L. monocytogenes, Ent. sakazakii and Salm. Enteritidis to polypropylene and stainless steel surfaces.

40|$|Despite {{the large}} number of studies {{addressing}} the quantification of phosphorus (P) availability by different extraction methods, many questions remain unanswered. The aim of this paper was to compare the effectiveness of the extractors Mehlich- 1, Anionic Resin (AR) and Mixed Resin (MR), to determine the availability of P under different experimental conditions. The laboratory study was arranged in randomized blocks in a &# 91;(3 x 3 x 2) + 3 &# 93; x 4 factorial design, with four replications, testing the response of three soils with different texture: a very clayey Red Latosol (LV), a sandy clay loam Red Yellow Latosol (LVA), and a sandy loam Yellow Latosol (LA), to three sources (triple superphosphate, reactive phosphate rock from Gafsa-Tunisia; and natural phosphate from Araxá-Minas Gerais) at two P rates (75 and 150 mg dm- 3), plus three control treatments (each soil without P application) after four <b>contact</b> <b>periods</b> (15, 30, 60, and 120 days) of the P sources with soil. The soil acidity of LV and LVA was adjusted by raising base saturation to 60 % with the application of CaCO 3 and MgCO 3 at a 4 : 1 molar ratio (LA required no correction). These samples were maintained at field moisture capacity for 30 days. After the <b>contact</b> <b>periods,</b> the samples were collected to quantify the available P concentrations by the three extractants. In general, all three indicated that the available P-content in soils was reduced after longer <b>contact</b> <b>periods</b> with the P sources. Of the three sources, this reduction was most pronounced for triple superphosphate, intermediate for reactive phosphate, while Araxá phosphate was least sensitive to the effect of time. It was observed that AR extracted lower P levels from all three soils when the sources were phosphate rocks, while MR extracted values close to Mehlich- 1 in LV (clay) and LVA (medium texture) for reactive phosphate. For Araxá phosphate, much higher P values were determined by Mehlich- 1 than by the resins, because of the acidity of the extractor. For triple superphosphate, both resins extracted higher P levels than Mehlich- 1, due to the consumption of this extractor, particularly when used for LV and LVA...|$|R

Maya of the European <b>contact</b> <b>period</b> said that knowing the past aided in both understanding the present and predicting the future (Diego de Landa).

The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than could be accomplished by simply hurling it with the arm alone. Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior. Commoners used blowguns in war, which also served as their hunting weapon. The bow and arrow is another weapon that was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting. Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period, its use as a weapon of war was not favoured; it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic. The <b>Contact</b> <b>period</b> Maya also used two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.|$|E

Plants absorb phosphate from the soil solution which is continuously replenished by fertilizer application and/or desorption from the soil solid phase. Anion exchange membranes (AEMs), act in a similar way to plant roots, adsorbing P from soil solution. Desorption of available P was studied in 1997 on two Gleysolic soils rich in P, a Ste. Rosalie clay soil and a Duravin sandy loam soil, using fluoride-saturated AEMs let in soil suspension for various <b>contact</b> <b>periods.</b> Determination of available P using these AEMs was compared to P extraction using the Mehlich III extractant for predicting P availability to soybean (Glycine max L.). Desorption from both soils, and subsequent adsorption by AEMs was found to decrease with time. A high P desorption rate was calculated for both soils with the Elovich equation. Different chemical and physical characteristics such as pH, Mehlich III extractable Al, Fe and Ca, sand and clay content were in some cases, positively correlated and in other cases, negatively correlated with various <b>contact</b> <b>periods</b> for both soils. The use of AEMs better predicted P availability than the Mehlich III extractant, although the most important asset of using AEMs is that they showed the desorption effect over time on P availability.
