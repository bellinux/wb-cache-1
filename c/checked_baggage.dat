5|$|Wail al-Shehri, {{his brother}} Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami arrived {{together}} at Logan Airport at 06:45 {{on the morning}} of September 11, 2001. Upon check-in, all three men were selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) for further screening of their <b>checked</b> <b>baggage.</b> As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint. One of the five Globe Aviation security screeners on-duty later reported that either Wail or Waleed had been using a crutch when they passed through security, and that the crutch had been X-rayed as per regulations.|$|E
25|$|Until August 2007 {{there was}} a system of color codes on <b>checked</b> <b>baggage</b> but the {{practice}} was discontinued after complaints of discrimination. In the past, <b>checked</b> <b>baggage</b> was screened following the personal interview and before passengers arrived at the check-in desks. Occasionally, if security assessed a person as a low risk, they were passed straight through to the check-in desks, bypassing the main X-ray machines, a practice which also drew some discrimination complaints. This process ceased in April 2014 when the main X-ray machines {{were removed from the}} passenger queuing area in terminal 3 and baggage screening began being performed after the baggage was checked-in by airline representatives (as is common in most airports around the world). Terminal 1 began using the same procedure in summer 2017.|$|E

25|$|Jaswant Basuta, a 47-year-old car mechanic, {{had checked}} in for Pan Am Flight 103, but {{arrived at the}} {{boarding}} gate too late. Having attended a family wedding in Belfast, he was returning to New York City {{to start a new}} job. Basuta was initially considered a suspect, as his <b>checked</b> <b>baggage</b> had been on the flight without him. This suspicion may have been heightened by Basuta having been a Sikh as militant Sikhs had been implicated in the bombing of Air India Flight 182 three years previously.|$|E
25|$|Although dry ice is not {{classified}} as a dangerous substance by the European Union, or as a hazardous material by the United States Department of Transportation for ground transportation, when shipped by air or water, it is regulated as a dangerous good and IATA packing instruction 954 (IATA PI 954) requires that it be labeled specially, including a diamond-shaped black-and white label, UN 1845. Also, arrangements must be in place to ensure adequate ventilation so that pressure build-up does not rupture the packaging. The Federal Aviation Administration in the US allows airline passengers to carry up to 2.5kg per person either as <b>checked</b> <b>baggage</b> or carry-on baggage, when used to refrigerate perishables.|$|E

In southern California it had a stop in Glendale, later replaced by the current stop in Van Nuys which, unlike Glendale, has Amtrak staff for <b>checking</b> <b>baggage.</b> (Glendale had an Amtrak ticketing office until Amtrak discontinued the Coast Starlights stop there.) ...|$|R
25|$|After check-in, all <b>checked</b> <b>baggage</b> is {{screened}} using sophisticated X-ray and CT scanners {{and put in}} {{a pressure}} chamber to trigger any possible explosive devices. Following the check-in process, passengers continue to personal security and passport control. Before passing through the metal detectors and putting carry-on baggage through the X-ray machine at the security checkpoint, passports and boarding passes are re-inspected and additional questions may be asked. Before boarding the aircraft, passports and boarding passes are verified once again. Security procedures for incoming flights are not as stringent, but passengers may be questioned by passport control depending on country of origin, or countries visited prior to arrival in Israel. Passengers who have recently visited countries at war with Israel (all Arab countries except Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Mauritania and Qatar) will be subject to further questioning.|$|E
25|$|Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) {{attempted}} {{to pass a}} more limited gun control measure that would have expanded background checks, but the bill was blocked in the Senate. Despite Obama's advocacy and subsequent mass shootings such as the Charleston church shooting, no major gun control bill passed Congress during Obama's presidency, {{in part due to}} the power of 2nd Amendment activists such as the National Rifle Association. Obama's presidency ironically saw expansion of gun rights in the United States, as the Supreme Court ruled in McDonald v. City of Chicago that the Second Amendment applies to the states in addition to the federal government. Obama signed into law two bills containing amendments reducing restrictions on gun owners, one which permitted guns to be transported in <b>checked</b> <b>baggage</b> on Amtrak trains and another which allowed the carrying of loaded firearms in national parks located in states allowing concealed carry.|$|E
25|$|The airport's {{security}} {{comes under}} the regulatory {{purview of the}} Airport Police Division of the Singapore Police Force (SPF). The day to day discharge of security functions at the airport are performed by auxiliary police forces including Aetos Security Management, Certis CISCO and SATS Security Services. Aetos and SATS Security Services are affiliated to the ground handling companies of Dnata and Singapore Changi Airport Terminal Services respectively. On 29 April 2008, CAAS signed its then biggest single security contract for all airport related security services by engaging Certis CISCO to provide security services at Singapore Changi Airport, as well as Seletar Airport, Changi Airfreight Centre, and the Singapore Air Traffic Control Centre. It involves the deployment of about 2,600 Certis Cisco personnel, including armed Auxiliary Police Officers and unarmed aviation security officers to perform tasks such as screening <b>checked</b> <b>baggage,</b> controlling access to restricted areas, and screening passengers before they board their aircraft.|$|E

500|$|The [...] station {{includes}} a Quik-Trak ticket vending machine, restrooms, a seating area and covered walkways {{to both the}} drive-up area and the [...] boarding platform. As the station is unstaffed, all tickets from the station need to be pre-paid, purchased from Quik-Trak or on the train from a conductor. Passengers in need of <b>checked</b> <b>baggage</b> service are advised to utilize the downtown station instead because of this. The station parking lot contains 300 spaces and costs $2 for each two hour period, up to $7 per day, per vehicle. All revenue generated from parking fees is used to finance the station's operating costs. Transport {{to and from the}} airport terminal is provided by the free shuttle buses operated by the airport.|$|E
500|$|When {{the station}} {{initially}} opened, entrances from 14th Street opened into a large, octagonal rotunda where ticket offices, <b>checked</b> <b>baggage,</b> and a newsstand were located. As {{the railroad tracks}} are grade separated behind Union Station, the platforms are accessed by a pedestrian tunnel under the tracks with stairs {{that lead to the}} platforms. The tunnel entrance is directly across the rotunda from the street entrancea portion of which is now used as the kitchen for a brewpub housed inside the station. The concourse, off the rotunda, led to the Peach Street entrances, and contained space for a soda fountain, a barber shop, and telegraph offices, as well as access to the station's [...] waiting room. Facing Peach Street, a dining room and lunch counter run by the Union News Company, which operated the majority of the dining services in New York Central stations, were {{at the opposite end of}} Union Station from the rotunda. The entire ground floor was laid with terrazzo featuring a mosaic border and Botticino marble paneling along the plaster walls. A green and tan color scheme was originally used throughout the entire building. Superintendents for both the New York Central and Pennsylvania railroads, as well as other railroad officials, had offices on the second floor of Union Station.|$|E

2500|$|By September 1984, Lorenzo's {{team had}} led the airline to surpass the number of seat miles flown prior to {{bankruptcy}} with 25% fewer employees. Though the airline was price competitive with new entry carriers, it still offered full services such as hot meals, <b>checked</b> <b>baggage,</b> a frequent flier program and co-sharing with partner airlines. Record profits of $30.3 million were reported {{for the third quarter}} in 1984. Continental had successfully transitioned from “a high-cost airline losing its proverbial shirt to being a low-cost carrier making good profits.” [...] In September 1986, the “New Continental” successfully emerged from bankruptcy as a lean, sustainable and profitable airline. Notably, Lorenzo's management team had reached agreements with all of its creditors to repay them at 100 cents-on-the-dollar with no equity compensation, a rarity in previous bankruptcies.|$|E

It is focused on both principled faults of detecting equipment and faults in utilizing. It is necessary to introduce in practice lately developed portals for checking persons and devices for <b>checking</b> <b>baggage</b> {{which are based on}} new physical principles.

2500|$|While the Wright Amendment {{prevented}} {{any other}} major airlines from starting service out of Love Field, {{it did not}} deter Southwest. Based on short trips to begin with, Southwest continued to flourish as it used multiple shorthaul flights to build its Love Field operation. Some people managed to [...] "work the system" [...] and get around the Wright Amendment's restrictions. For example, a person could fly from Dallas to Houston or Albuquerque, change planes, and then fly to any city Southwest served — although he had, at the time, to do so on two tickets in each direction, since the Wright Amendment specifically barred airlines from issuing tickets that violated the law's provisions. [...] This work-around was also problematic {{due to the fact}} that between flights <b>checked</b> <b>baggage</b> had to be collected and checked onto the next flight. This had the effect of creating mini-hubs at Houston/Hobby Airport and the Albuquerque International Sunport. Southwest continued to grow and became one of the most successful and profitable airlines in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{passengers}} generally {{were not}} allowed access to the baggage car, they were included in {{a great number of}} passenger trains as regular equipment. The baggage car is a car that was normally placed between the train's motive power and the remainder of the passenger train. [...] The car's interior is normally wide open and is used to carry passengers' <b>checked</b> <b>baggage.</b> Baggage cars were also sometimes commissioned by freight companies to haul less-than-carload (LCL) shipments along passenger routes (Railway Express Agency was one such freight company). Some baggage cars included restroom facilities for the train crew, so many baggage cars had doors to access them just like any other passenger car. [...] Baggage cars could be designed to look like the rest of a passenger train's cars, or they could be repurposed box cars equipped with high-speed trucks and passenger train steam and air connections. A special type of baggage car came equipped with doors on one end to facilitate transport of [...] large pieces of equipment and scenery for Broadway shows and other productions.
