40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on the {{development}} of thermal energy storage systems (TES) based on phase changing materials (PCM), to be used as <b>back-up</b> <b>devices</b> during transient operations of small and medium scale concentrated solar plants (CSP). The development of the storage device will be performed recurring to numerical simulation and experimental testing in the laboratory. At the current stage the laboratory is being built, while the implementation of a numerical tool to simulate the behaviour of tanks with different geometries and different working materials has started. The preliminary development of the storage device is carried out by means of a 3 D numerical simulation code specifically implemented in the COMSOL Multiphysics environment. The code is used to solve direct (design) and indirect (analysis) problems considering heat storage tanks with different geometries and different working materials. The geometry chosen for this preliminary analysis is the shell and tube heat exchanger, whose shell is filled with PCM and the working fluid flows on the tube side (up to 200 - 220 Â°C to simulate the heat transfer fluid from the solar field). The system is designed for a heat storage capacity of 36 MJ...|$|R
50|$|Safety <b>back-up</b> <b>device,</b> this is {{the most}} {{important}} tool as it a provides a redundancy should an ascender, descender, working rope or anchor fail. It is attached to the safety (second rope) and designed to be kept as high as possible to reduce the distance fallen in the event of a fall. The safety devices usually relies on friction transferred to the safety rope by means of a cam. The Petzl Shunt, a recreational climbing device, has been used successfully for many years for the safety back-up because it is positionable by the user, allowing it to be high above them at the work site and thus providing optimum protection. Concern over potential misuse and lack of user instructions or support for its use by Petzl has led to the development of other devices, including the Petzl ASAP, the KONG Back-Up, the DMM Buddy Catch, the SafeTec Duck-R. Unlike traditional devices that rely on friction to absorb shock the ASAP relies on a toothed wheel and an rip-stitch single use shock pack and although has the advantage of self trailing it tends to creep below the user. The Duck-R is a beefed-up stainless steel Shunt-shaped device designed specifically for use in rope access. All devices are connected back to the harness by means of a lanyard, otherwise known as a cow's tail, and fastened to the lanyard by a screwgate carabiner.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Prehospital {{advanced}} airway management, including prehospital {{endotracheal intubation}} is challenging and recent papers {{have addressed the}} need for proper training, skill maintenance and quality control for emergency medical service personnel. The {{aim of this study}} was to provide data regarding airway management-training and expertise from the regional physician-staffed emergency medical service (EMS). Methods The EMS in this part of The Central Region of Denmark is a two tiered system. The second tier comprises physician staffed Mobile Emergency Care Units. The medical directors of the programs supplied system data. A questionnaire addressing airway management experience, training and knowledge was sent to the EMS-physicians. Results There are no specific guidelines, standard operating procedures or standardised program for obtaining and maintaining skills regarding prehospital advanced airway management in the schemes covered by this study. 53 / 67 physicians responded; 98, 1 % were specialists in anesthesiology, with an average of 17, 6 years of experience in anesthesiology, and 7, 2 years experience as EMS-physicians. 84, 9 % reported having attended life support course(s), 64, 2 % an advanced airway management course. 24, 5 % fulfilled the curriculum suggested for Danish EMS physicians. 47, 2 % had encountered a difficult or impossible PHETI, most commonly in a patient in cardiac arrest or a trauma patient. Only 20, 8 % of the physicians were completely familiar with what <b>back-up</b> <b>devices</b> were available for airway management. Conclusions In this, the first Danish study of prehospital advanced airway management, we found a high degree of experience, education and training among the EMS-physicians, but their equipment awareness was limited. Check-outs, guidelines, standard operating procedures and other quality control measures may be needed. </p...|$|R

We aim at minimizing the maximum thermal discomfort of the connected users after a pipe breakage by an integrated and centralized {{management of the}} user control-valves. Our control strategy uses a gradient-based optimizer driven by discrete adjoint sensitivities, which makes it fast and nearly insensitive to the problem dimensions. We tested the proposed approach by simulating a set of different malfunctions in the Turin District heating network and by analyzing the building temperature field during the optimizer convergence history. Compared to the control strategy in use today, we observe that our approach flattens the temperature field and eliminates discomfort peaks, bringing a considerable increase of the minimum user temperature which ranges from a minimum of 1. 8 Â°C {{to a maximum of}} 15. 4 Â°C. Furthermore, our optimization strategy allows for superior results to what is achievable conventionally with an 85 % increase of the pumping head, making <b>back-up</b> pumping <b>devices</b> a non-necessary investment...|$|R
40|$|The {{popularity}} of day case surgical procedures has increased immensely {{over the last}} few years. Though various techniques are available for carrying out day-case anesthesia, preference for a technique depends upon the type of procedure, patient profile, associated co-morbidities, available infrastructure and <b>back-up</b> facilities, monitoring <b>devices</b> and comfort of the attending anesthesiologist with the technique. Day-case spinal anesthesia for ambulatory surgery has gained a wider acceptance and numerous drugs are available for use in loco-regional anesthesia. Articaine is one such amide local anesthetic drug which is increasingly being used in day care surgeries. Properties of articaine such as faster onset, shorter elimination time and rapid recovery from sensory and motor blockade make it a very useful agent in local and regional anesthesia for day care surgical procedures. This article aims to review these properties of articaine so as to evaluate how useful articaine can be for ambulatory surgical procedures...|$|R
50|$|The October 2009 {{launch date}} {{could not be}} {{achieved}} due to delays in the spacecraft development. During 2009, officials admitted that the schedule was very tight, but still hoped until the last moment that a launch could be made. On 21 September 2009 the mission was officially announced to be delayed until the next launch window in 2011. A main reason for the delay was difficulties encountered during development of the spacecraft's onboard computers. While the Moscow-based company Tehkhom provided the computer hardware on time, the internal NPO Lavochkin team responsible for integration and software development fell behind schedule. The retirement of NPO Lavochkin's head Valeriy N. Poletskiy in January 2010 was widely seen as linked to the delay of Fobos-Grunt. Viktor Khartov was appointed {{the new head of}} the company. During the extra development time resulting from the delay, a Polish-built drill was added to the Phobos lander as a <b>back-up</b> soil extraction <b>device.</b>|$|R
40|$|Fossil fuels, {{which are}} the main energy sources of the current world, are running low and {{alternative}} ways of generating and storing different types of energies are becoming daunting missions. Renewable energy is very attractive because {{the source of the}} energy is often free and also environmentally friendly. The key issue to utilise the renewable energies in sustainable manner is how effectively store the energies and provide them on demand. Therefore, the significance of the energy storage devices has been widely recognised in recent time. Electrochemical capacitors (ECs), which are also commonly known as supercapacitors, are a type of the energy storage devices and the ECs are widely used as a <b>back-up</b> power boosting <b>device</b> to the batteries. Due to EC's low energy characteristics (typically, lower than 5 Wh/kg), their applications are limited. Therefore, main aim {{of this study is to}} enhance the energy characteristics of the ECs. In particular, aqueous ECs were examined due to a number of advantages offered by the water-based system. It was found that neutral aqueous electrolytes can expand the operating voltage close to 2 V (aqueous ECs commonly operate within 1 V) with advanced designs and hence result in remarkably higher energy. Moreover, the optimum condition of the neutral aqueous electrolytes was investigated by examining the effect of ion size, concentration and temperature. One of the main disadvantages of using the aqueous electrolytes in low temperatures was successfully resolved by using concentrated electrolytes (freezing point depressed up to - 20 Â°C). Mn 02 with carbon materials were also used to construct asymmetrical ECs. The highest specific energy (Wh/kg) of the neutral aqueous ECs was achieved at 20 Wh/kg using unequal electrode design. This result is very much comparable to the Pb-acid battery. Based on the obtained data, larger scale (thicker and bigger electrode films) of the prototype ECs were constructed and their results correspond well with the results obtained from the smaller ECs. The data of the neutral aqueous ECs, which is contained in this thesis, suggest that the water-based ECs have a remarkable market potential...|$|R
