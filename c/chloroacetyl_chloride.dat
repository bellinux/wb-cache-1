40|$|The {{metabolism}} of the chlorinated ethylenes may {{be explained}} by the formation of chloroethylene epoxides as the first intermediate products.

Rearrangements of the chloroethylene glycols formed from the epoxides by hydration may also take place, but would appear, at least in the case of 1, 1 -dichloroethylene, to be quantitatively less important.
