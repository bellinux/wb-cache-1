2500|$|The Williams Canal across De Soto Peninsula {{had been}} {{abandoned}} by Adm. Farragut and Brig. Gen.

In late January 1863, Sherman's men, at the urging of Grant—who was advised by the navy that President Lincoln liked the idea—resumed digging. Sherman derisively called the work [...] "Butler's Ditch" [...] (since it was Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler who had sent Williams upriver to do the work), which was barely 6 feet wide by 6 feet deep. Grant, undoubtedly influenced by Lincoln's <b>continuous</b> <b>inquiries</b> as to the status of the canal, ordered Sherman to expand the canal to 60 feet wide and 7 feet deep and the effort became known as Grant's Canal. It was not properly engineered based upon the hydrology of the Mississippi River, however, and a sudden rise in the river broke through the dam {{at the head of the}} canal and flooded the area. The canal began to fill up with back water and sediment. In a desperate effort to rescue the project, two huge steam-driven dipper dredges, Hercules and Sampson, attempted to clear the channel, but the dredges were exposed to Confederate artillery fire from the bluffs at Vicksburg and driven away. By late March, work on the canal was abandoned. (Remnants of about 200 yards of Grant's Canal are maintained by the Vicksburg National Military Park in Louisiana).|$|R

Mobile learning is taking on new qualities and characteristics as devices become ever more integrated with everyday life and wearables intensify the increasingly close relationship between people and technology. The notion of ‘assistance’ is foregrounded in the context of more informal learning in settings where teachers may be hard to access or when additional practice is needed.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{emergency}} {{physician in}} charge role has developed in many large EDs {{to assist with}} patient flow. We aimed to describe and classify the problem-solving actions that this role requires. METHODS: We interviewed senior emergency physicians and performed iterative, qualitative observations, using <b>continuous</b> reflective <b>inquiry,</b> in a single centre.

The study illustrates the use of the systems maps, spray diagrams, iceberg tool, brainwriting and rich pictures in surfacing the assumptions and beliefs about the failure of DAS and IQMS. With this approach, SMTs and principals developed their ideas about the way they could implement DAS and IQMS. Systems thinking provided a perspective for approaching the problematic situations. A conceptual model for DAS and IQMS evolved though the collaborative efforts of SMT members and principals. A developmental and holistic model evolved from this process of school development. A new way of thinking about problematic situations is presented to participants. A process of dialogue set the stage for. school development.

During the 2000 - 2001 school year, researchers {{worked with the}} leadership team (13 educators) of a county accommodation school district in a major urban center in the southwestern United States. The general goal of professional development was to assist the leadership team in accomplishing high quality work while {{paying attention to the}} underlying moral purposes of their work at an accommodation school district that serves homeless children, incarcerated children, and children who have been unsuccessful in their prior school experiences. The approach asked education leaders to explore their own stories, their workplace experiences, and professional dilemmas as they crafted stories of practice. Three general assumptions about professional development guided the project: (1) to respect the intellectual capacity of school administrators and others in the school district; (2) to focus on building competence with attention to individual and organizational leadership; and (3) to promote <b>continuous</b> <b>inquiry</b> and school betterment that are embedded in the daily practice of schools.

The study discussed the current training program for mentors in South Carolina and the expected outcomes the training is supposed to produce. The South Carolina Initial Mentor Training was studied in a cohort of nine school districts in the midlands and upstate of South Carolina in partnership with Winthrop University. The expected outcomes of the program were creating professional growth environments for new teachers grounded in the norms of <b>continuous</b> <b>inquiry,</b> ongoing assessment, and problem-solving; recognizing and practicing the attitudes, behaviors, and skills of effective mentors; identifying beginning teacher needs and modifying support in response to those needs; and using various tools that support an integrated system of formative assessment and support. This study used a mixed-methods design which included surveys and interviews with mentor teachers to identify themes that were linked to their efficacy in being able to work with beginning teachers after participating in the South Carolina Initial Mentor Training program. The researcher analyzed the surveys for emerging themes and developed follow-up interview questions for random interviews of trained mentors. The four themes that emerged were the need for mentor training, the most helpful tools to build efficacy, the least helpful tools to build efficacy, and suggestions for mentor program improvement. Based on the results of this study, mentor teachers who have completed the South Carolina Initial Mentor Training Program have a much stronger feeling of efficacy in their ability to support beginning teachers...|$|E

Therefore, {{it is important for}} the organization to practice learning the theory of the organization in order to create continuous improvement in various scopes of work. This research is about the factors that influence learning organization among managers in City Hall of Kuala Lumpur. Factors of learning organization such as training and education, reward and recognition, information flow and vision and strategy have been identified in order to investigate whether or not these factors have a significant relationship with the dimension of learning organization. The survey was conducted in 24 departments in City Hall of Kuala Lumpur such as the Administration Department; Civil Engineering Department; Culture, Arts, Tourism and Sports Department; Human Resource Management Department; Information Technology and Communication Department and others. The sample size for this study was 100 officers who had a bachelor's degree in different courses study and involved decision making in City Hall of Kuala Lumpur. Data was obtained using two methods which were primary and secondary data. Respondents were required to answer the questionnaires that include the statements regarding the factors that influence learning about organization among managers in City Hall of Kuala Lumpur. Once the necessary data was collected, the data was analyzed and summarized in a readable and easily interpretable form. The Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 12. 0 was used to summarize the data. The results are in the form of reliability testing, descriptive statistics, ANOVA, t-test and correlation. Based on this research, the result indicates that all factors have a significant relationship between all the elements of learning organization which include <b>continuous</b> learning, <b>inquiry</b> and dialogue, team learning, empowerment, embedded system, system connection and strategic leadership.

40|$|Feminist epistemologists {{have often}} argued that our {{relationships}} with structures of power shape the content, expression, and social force {{of what we}} know. While feminist standpoint theorists have often maintained that experiences {{on the margins of}} social power can lead to better understandings of the roles of systems of oppression in society, more recent writings on epistemologies of ignorance examine the reverse, how experiences from positions of social power limit our understandings. In this project, I draw on the concept of epistemic privilege as it has been formulated by feminist standpoint theorists, criticisms of objectivity and fixed, transcendent truths, and analyses of the relationships between structures of power and concepts of knowing. By considering the works of Sandra Harding, Lorraine Code, and Patricia Hill Collins, among others, I argue that knowledge is situational and contingent and that some individuals possess privileged understandings due to their positions on the margins of power structures. However, I also argue that, in order for feminist epistemology to utilize the concept of epistemic privilege successfully, it must incorporate a concept of error into its considerations of constructions of knowledge. Thus, throughout this dissertation, I examine how a concept of error could bolster efforts to subvert the dominant approaches to knowledge that have upheld male privilege and undermine the patriarchal power structures that rely on them. I propose a form of feminist inquiry that incorporates a method of error sensitivity, which will enable inquirers to recognize when institutions of power, individual limitations, and cultural myths are restricting knowing subjects' perspectives and leading them to commit errors. This concept of error, and the related approach to error-sensitive inquiry, relies upon a commitment to <b>continuous</b> and ever-expanding <b>inquiry</b> by a community, rather than an isolated individual. Thus, I derive much of my conceptual framework from the work of Josiah Royce and his concepts of the Beloved Community, loyalty to loyalty, and communities of interpretation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} factors {{contributing}} {{to the use of}} evaluations in nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) from a field perspective and answers to the question if organizations with more learning characteristics show increased use of evaluations to adapt programs. To get to the answers, literature on the use of evaluation and Learning Organizations was studied and reviewed. A survey was conducted among field based senior NGO managers. Two existing survey instruments were used; one was developed by Karan (2009) to determine factors influencing evaluation use. The other one was developed by Marsick and Watkins (2003) and Yang (2004) to measure learning characteristics of NGOs. The combined survey was answered online using SurveyGismo by 68 respondents representing at least 20 different International NGOs, 85 % of them with headquarters in Europe and all with operations in low income countries across the world. Use of evaluations can be categorized according to their type of use and grouped under instrumental (direct use of findings to adjust program or policy), conceptual (contribute to generate new knowledge and understanding), process (participative process leading to learning and ownership) and legitimize (justify pre-existing preferences and actions). Different types of intended use tend to use different methodologies and approaches for the actual evaluation process; from scientific-experimental approaches to participant-oriented approaches. Factors influencing use determined in previous research are categorized under human factors (intended users, interests and biases and professional capabilities), evaluation factors (evaluation procedures, substance of information and reporting) and organizational factors (organizational culture, routines and procedures). These factors influencing use of evaluation were consistent with the most important determinants for use by the field based NGO managers in the survey carried out for this thesis. However a statistical regression of the factors influencing the use of evaluations to adapt programs revealed that only one factor, „available time and money‟, was significant with R 2 is 0, 09 (F= 6, 78, p< 0, 05). Learning Organizations have characteristics that can be described by four dimensions on the people level (<b>Continuous</b> learning, <b>Inquiry</b> and dialogue, Team learning and Embedded systems) and three level on the structural level (Empowerment, System connection, Strategic leadership) of organizations. Using the DLOQ (Dimensions of Learning Organizations Questionnaire) survey results respondents were divided in two groups, one group with “more learning characteristics” and one group with “less learning characteristics”. Cronbach‟s alfa (α) was 0, 83 demonstrating a good internal consistency and item reliability for the 21 items measured in the instrument. The most important {{difference between the two groups}} could be noted in the existence of an organization wide process to follow up on evaluation findings in NGOs with more learning characteristics (67 % compared to 45 %). Also respondents from NGOs with more learning characteristics are more likely to use evaluation recommendations to adjust programs (80 % compared to 45 %). A linear regression of the average score on Learning Organization characteristics revealed that there is indeed a positive relation; higher scores on Learning Organization characteristics leads to higher use of evaluations to adapt programs (R 2 = 0, 17, F= 13, 19, p< 0, 05). The overall conclusion of this thesis is when intended use and users are determined and elaborated from the designing phase of an evaluation, the actual use by intended users is more likely to happen. Organizations making time and money available are more likely to use evaluation to adapt their programs. Learning Organizations or organizations with stronger learning characteristics are better positioned to ensure the actual use of evaluations...|$|R
40|$|A school {{district}} on a Native American reservation {{in the southwestern}} region of the U. S. decided to implement the Teacher Advancement Program (TAP) to improve teacher instructional effectiveness and student academic achievement. Although researchers have documented successes of the TAP in high-poverty urban {{school district}}s across the U. S., little is known regarding the TAP implementation in remote Native American cultural context schools. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate if the collaborative process of the TAP implementation changed the teachers 2 ̆ 7 instructional practices. Using Vygotsky 2 ̆ 7 s social constructivism, which emphasizes that learning happens through interactions and cooperation of people in their environments, this qualitative case study investigated 9 teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the TAP implementation using interview, walkthrough observation and document analysis at the schools. The research questions focused on teachers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of TAP elements, their experiences, changes in practices and the influence of the Native American setting. A qualitative data analysis software program and constant comparison method were used to manage and analyze the qualitative data. Findings indicated that positive collegial collaboration, teacher attitude, and instructional change were associated with the TAP implementation, teacher evaluation (most challenging experience), teacher professional growth, and student academic achievement growth (most rewarding experiences). A district professional development plan was created to build on the strength of the TAP collegial collaboration and to meet the rigorous demand of the new state College and Career Readiness standards. The change of teachers 2 ̆ 7 working in isolation to collegial collaboration reflects a positive social change for <b>continuous</b> <b>inquiry</b> into both student and teacher learning...|$|E

It also endeavors to {{lay the foundation for}} empirical analysis of CoP processes, which to date have been explained almost exclusively using qualitative case study methods. Land-grant universities were founded on the ideals that higher education should be accessible to all, that the university should teach liberal and practical subjects and should share the college 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge with people throughout their states. eXtension is an educational partnership of more than 70 land-grant universities. Its reported purpose is to help Americans improve their lives with access to timely, objective, research-based information and educational opportunities accessed through [URL]. This Web resource is customized with links to state land-grant university CE Web sites. This mixed-method, action research project applied to the virtual environment describes the extent to which people who became part of an eXtension Communities of Practice (XCoPs) reported that they engaged in purposeful cycles of <b>continuous</b> <b>inquiry</b> in dialog, decision, action, and evaluation (DDAE) and the attainment of eXtension‘s goals. An Internet survey obtained descriptive data of members‘ participation within the eight pioneer XCoPs to assess the extent to which each XCoP engaged in the DDAE cycles of inquiry. Analysis of the survey data resulted in the categorization of low-, medium-, and high-level functioning XCoPs. Members of three pioneer XCoPs representing each category (low, medium, high collaboration) participated in online interviews that revealed how CE‘s reward structure, XCoP membership composition, and leader/member skill sets impact XCoP performance in meeting eXtension goals.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was an explorative and descriptive {{analysis of the}} actual structure guiding professional activity in nursing practice. Professional activity was defined as consisting of the application of nursing theory and technique through rigorous instrumental problem-solving in clinical nursing practice. The model for application of nursing theory currently taught in nursing curricula {{is described as a}} sequential problem-solving framework called nursing process. The goal of this research {{investigation was}} to observe and describe the model used guiding professional behavior in actual nursing practice, and compare this on-site model to the espoused model of nursing process. Such validation offered implications for curricular modifications for nurse educator and nurse leaders as they develop realistic nursing undergraduate programs and promulgate standards of nursing practice. ^ Qualitative methods were used to describe the on-site model of nursing practice. Content analysis, field observation and collaborative inquiry were the methods used for this investigation. Key concepts derived from content analyses of a structured interview were compared to actual observed behaviors of each research participant in clinical practice. Through collaborative inquiry, nurse participants provided descriptions and explanations for inconsistencies resulting from the comparison of the observed behavior to the analyzed initial interview. The integration of qualitative methods was designed to enhance validity of the researcher 2 ̆ 7 s inferences and nurse participants 2 ̆ 7 descriptions of the actual structure guiding their behavior in clinical practice. ^ An urban university hospital located in a large metropolitan city was the site for this investigation. Thirty-three medical-surgical registered nurses participated in this investigation. ^ As a result of this study: (a) the on-site use of nursing process was found to be inconsistent with the nursing process framework currently taught in undergraduate curricula; (b) the guiding framework for actual nursing practice was described; (c) four implications for curricular modification were presented. ^ The primary implication resulting from this investigation is for nurse educators, administrators and staff development departments to collaborate in designing programs which shape professional behaviors necessary for <b>continuous</b> <b>inquiry</b> in reflective practice. ...|$|E
40|$|Background There is {{considerable}} {{debate about the}} two most commonly used scoring methods, namely, the formula scoring (popularly referred to as negative marking method in our environment) and number right scoring methods. Although the negative marking scoring system attempts to discourage students from guessing {{in order to increase}} test reliability and validity, there is the view that it is an excessive and unfair penalty that also increases anxiety. Feedback from students is part of the education process; thus, this study assessed the perception of medical students about negative marking method for multiple choice question (MCQ) examination formats and also the effect of gender and risk-taking behavior on scores obtained with this assessment method. Methods This was a prospective multicenter survey carried out among fifth year medical students in Enugu State University and the University of Nigeria. A structured questionnaire was administered to 175 medical students from the two schools, while a class test was administered to medical students from Enugu State University. Qualitative statistical methods including frequencies, percentages, and chi square were used to analyze categorical variables. Quantitative statistics using analysis of variance was used to analyze <b>continuous</b> variables. Results <b>Inquiry</b> into assessment format revealed that most of the respondents preferred MCQs (65. 9 %). One hundred and thirty students (74. 3 %) had an unfavorable perception of negative marking. Thirty-nine students (22. 3 %) agreed that negative marking reduces the tendency to guess and increases the validity of MCQs examination format in testing knowledge content of a subject compared to 108 (61. 3 %) who disagreed with this assertion (χ 2 = 23. 0, df = 1, P = 0. 000). The median score of the students who were not graded with negative marking was significantly higher than the score of the students graded with negative marking (P = 0. 001). There was no statistically significant difference in the risk-taking behavior between male and female students in their MCQ answering patterns with negative marking method (P = 0. 618). Conclusions In the assessment of students, it is more desirable to adopt fair penalties for discouraging guessing rather than excessive penalties for incorrect answers, which could intimidate students in negative marking schemes. There is no consensus on the penalty for an incorrect answer. Thus, {{there is a need for}} continued research into an effective and objective assessment tool that will ensure that the students’ final score in a test truly represents their level of knowledge...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the relationships and ways in which the learning environment influences the process of organisational knowledge creation and organisational knowledge performance in public research and development organisations in Malaysia. A unified research model which captured the dimensions of the learning organisation (Watkins and Marsick, 1993) as determinants of the knowledge creation process (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995) and its impact on organisational knowledge performance was proposed. The argument put forward in this study was that, knowledge creation process is influenced by an organisational environment in which there is continuous learning, dialogue and inquiry, team learning, embedded systems to support learning, empowerment, leadership support for learning and connection of the environment to the system. The process of knowledge creation through socialisation, externalisation, combination and internalisation was also assumed to have a direct influence on organisational knowledge performance. The study was carried out in three public research and development organisations in the state of Selangor. A key aspect of the research was the use of a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative method played a major part in this study whereby respondents for the survey were selected using a systematic sampling method. The qualitative research was undertaken by conducting on site interviews to facilitate the interpretations of the quantitative results. Results from the quantitative analysis suggested that the influence of the learning environment on organisational knowledge performance was mediated by explicit knowledge process. The results also revealed that explicit knowledge process fully mediated leadership support and systems connection; whilst dialogue and <b>inquiry,</b> <b>continuous</b> learning and embedded systems were partially mediated. Based upon the research findings, a revised final model was then incorporated. The qualitative research began with the initial theoretical framework built from extant literature. The interviews provided further evidence that knowledge creation process could be enhanced in a learning environment. Elements of trust, motivation, work culture and values and resources as proposed by the literature but not included in the survey were uncovered also contributed to empirical evidence (qualitatively). Effective knowledge creation process will contribute to organisational knowledge performance. However, the public sector, where management is more bureaucratic, posed a greater challenge in creating an environment for knowledge management, as a delicate balance has to be attained; on the one hand what is sufficiently open and flexible to allow knowledge processes to flourish and on the other possess enough formality and discipline to ensure that knowledge processes produce tangible outputs which would contribute to organisational improvements...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{fundamental issues}} in sustainability thinking, especially {{in relation to}} its epistemological and methodological bases. The sustainability crisis has invoked multiple schools of thought cross-cutting wide range of human activities/ scholarships. The resultant diversity of perspectives has imparted {{a high degree of}} ambiguity, and an intellectual &lsquo;looseness&rsquo;, potentially obfuscating many sustainability issues, which in consequence deepened social confusion and political inaction. Despite this, sustainability has taken on a certain moral tone as a normative goal of society, which is based upon implicit assumptions about the constituent forms of knowledge and the methods by which this knowledge is legitimated. It is out of these normative bases of sustainability that &lsquo;sustainability science&rsquo; has emerged as an overt attempt aiming to champion pluralistic and integrated forms of knowledge and research in addressing the sustainability crisis. Chapter 1 analyzes the intellectual standing of sustainability. This reveals the necessity for an intellectual perspective to replace the normative essence associated with the notion, and a necessary pluralistic orientation and avenue of knowledge. This intellectual perspective&mdash;formed in Chapter 2 &mdash;stipulates that sustainability scholarship needs to operate both across and within disciplines, albeit cognizant of a more integrated reality. The reductionist mode of enquiry is unable to do this. Thus, the sustainability crisis requires a new mode of enquiry, which can enable the production of &lsquo;bricks of knowledge while looking at the whole building&rsquo;, in contrary to the production of &lsquo;specialized bricks of knowledge at the expense of not seeing the whole building&rsquo; as characteristic of the reductionist mode. This new mode of enquiry necessitates a fundamental intellectual process, capable of enabling the pluralistic orientation and avenue of knowledge. Accordingly, based on fundamental research the thesis aims to analyze the sustainability science discourse and, through both deductive and inductive methods, develop a fundamental intellectual process to inform on the dimensions and structure of a pluralistic knowledge avenue, leading to the laying of an intellectual foundation for the scholarship of sustainability. This is corresponded to three key research questions (KRQs) : KRQ- 1 : How can an intellectual process fundamentally be framed in order to study the pluralistic knowledge and research structures regarding sustainability? KRQ- 2 : What are the basic structures of the discourse of sustainability science and how are they structured? KRQ- 3 : How might a pluralistic knowledge avenue and the layout of an intellectual foundation for the scholarship of sustainability be elicited based on the rationale, framing and application of the fundamental intellectual process? The thesis takes the first decade&rsquo;s &lsquo;body of work&rsquo; of sustainability science as a dataset for analysis in answering these questions through heuristic fundamental research. Chapters 1 - 3 reflect fundamental research, while Chapters 4 - 6 and Chapter 7 present the results of heuristic deductive analysis and inductive analysis, respectively. The rationale for the KRQs is formed in Chapters 1 - 2, besides forming the intellectual perspective of sustainability. KRQ- 1 is addressed in Chapter 3 in empirically framing a fundamental intellectual process. The analysis of the first decade&rsquo;s &lsquo;body of work&rsquo; of sustainability science is presented in Chapters 4 - 6, elucidating the discursive, integrative and contextual structures of its discourse, thus, addressing KRQ- 2. These together form a <b>continuous</b> thread of <b>inquiry</b> on the intellectual treatment of sustainability, leading to addressing KRQ- 3 in Chapter 7. In framing the fundamental intellectual process the Chapter 3 produces a fundamental literature organization process resulting in a structure of five cross-connected layers of organizations within the literature archive, while a discourse analysis mechanism produces an analytical process based on a system of five stages of discourse analysis. These together construct a fundamental scheme for analyzing the basic structures of pluralistic knowledge/ research. There are four key findings (KF) arising from Chapters 4 - 6. KF- 1 reveals an overall lack of precision in characterizing the concept of &lsquo;human-environment system&rsquo; in sustainability science along with an extremely open-ended representation. KF- 2, revealing the overall contribution of sustainability science as consistent across its three different basic structures demonstrates mere structural contributions while lacking in intellectual capacities to provide the functional aspects to the intellectual treatment of sustainability. Based on conceptualization and extensive exemplification of a theoretical framework on the language of conversation in sustainability research KF- 3 produces a new intellectual lens for approaching effective trans-disciplinary sustainability research through facilitating knowledge co-production. KF- 4 reveals a strong correlation between the dominant &lsquo;original nature&rsquo; and the characters of &lsquo;literature survey&rsquo; and &lsquo;literature archive analysis&rsquo; (being the &lsquo;mode of conduction&rsquo; and the &lsquo;utilized research method&rsquo;, respectively) of sustainability science research, together with a dominance of these characters across the other empirical classes. This reveals the significance of fundamental literature organization and analysis process in brokering common language and understanding for the enabling of sustainability scholarship, besides breaking the impasse of the conventional incompatibility between original research and literature analysis processes. In Chapter 7, the KF 1 - 4 are analyzed in terms of different dimensions of the pluralistic knowledge avenue. The chapter also produces the structure of this avenue through inductively projecting on the characteristics of an integration expertise in light of the new mode of enquiry. Besides, Chapter 7 also extracts nine latent elements/ characters of an intellectual foundation of the scholarship of sustainability from the rationale, framing and application of the fundamental intellectual process as well as the inductive framing of the pluralistic knowledge avenue. These together produce the basis for an integrated theory on the intellectual foundation of sustainability. In summary, new knowledge components are pertinent to KF 1 - 4 and the inductive framing of the pluralistic knowledge avenue. Through fundamentally analyzing the prevailing scholastic reality of sustainability that is based on normative assumption-based works, the thesis produces a structure of sustainability scholarship based on fundamental intellectual justification. Its implications for sustainability science include: (i) the possibility of overcoming reductionist methods&mdash;constraining the contribution of the practice&mdash;through active intellectual orientation of the new mode of enquiry, (ii) prospects for innovation in the practice stem from the integrative structure of its discourse and in developing functional-intellectual capabilities, and (iii) a fundamental intellectual process is a means to overcome its normative impulse...|$|R
