Ilona Lundströmin väitöskirjassa tutkitaan kuntien julkisia palveluhankintoja ja niiden hankintaprosessissa esiintyviä ongelmia. Tutkimuksesta käy ilmi, mitä ongelmia kuntien palveluhankinnoissa esiintyy ja miksi niitä esiintyy. Hankintaprosessissa haasteita ilmenee erityisesti hankinnan suunnittelun ja tarjouspyynnön valmistelun vaiheessa. Useimmiten ongelmat kuntien palveluhankinnoissa johtuvat hankintaosaamisen puutteista. Kuntien palveluhankinnoissa haasteita aiheuttavat myös markkinat ja niiden toimimattomuus. Kuntien muutostilanteet, kuten kuntaliitokset heijastuvat niin ikään palveluhankintoihin ja aiheuttavat niissä ongelmia. Kunnat pyrkivät palveluhankinnoissaan yhä useammin muodostamaan kumppanuuksia palveluja tuottavien yritysten kanssa. Kilpailuttaminen ei kuitenkaan tue kumppanuuksien syntymistä. Hankintamenettelyjen läpivieminen siten, että kumppanuuksien muodostaminen mahdollistuu, vaatii hankintayksiköiltä vankkaa osaamista ja suunnitelmallisuutta palveluhankinnoissa. Suurin osa kuntien palveluhankinnoissa esiintyvistä ongelmista olisi vältettävissä hankintojen huolellisella valmistelulla. Tutkimustulosten käytäntöön jalkauttamisen voisi tiivistää hankinnan valmistelun osalta ohjeeseen: Hankinnan valmisteluun on varattava reilusti aikaa. Hankintaa kannattaa valmistella oman organisaation lisäksi potentiaalisten tarjoajien ja palvelun loppukäyttäjien, kuntalaisten kanssa. Toimimalla avoimesti ja hyödyntämällä verkostoja monet hankintaprosessin myöhemmässä vaiheessa eteen tulevat ongelmat ovat vältettävissä. Kuntien palveluhankintojen ongelmakohtien tunnistaminen ja niihin varautuminen on kunnalle keskeinen keino päästä palveluhankinnassa onnistuneeseen lopputulokseen. Study {{examines}} {{the problems of}} public procurement process of services in Finnish municipalities. The objectives of the study are to increase understanding of problems that occur in public procurement of services in municipalities and to show in which parts of the procurement process and in which services the problems occur. The study describes the problems of service procurements in a comprehensive way so {{that the results of}} the study provide solutions to the problems for practitioners, which is done by dividing the problems by both steps of the procurement process and by the service category. The study also aims at finding links between problems of public service procurement and change in governance of municipalities so that new theoretical knowledge of changes of governance, operating environment and operations of municipalities. The study develops the theoretical basis of governance and the changing local administration through empirical evidence of public service procurement. The empirical data of the research consists of e-mail messages sent by municipalities, cities, regions and other local level municipal actors to the Public Procurement Advisory Unit 2004 - 2006 holding questions about public service procurement. The Public Procurement Advisory Unit is a joint project of the Ministry of Employment and Economy and the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities. The Advisory Unit serves public procurement units by providing them with free advice on the public procurement law, the application of the law and good practices in procurement. The research method in this study was qualitative content analysis. The analysis was carried out by means of abductive reasoning. The theory bound analysis was implemented at the first stage inductively. To the end of the analysis the theoretical framework influenced the reasoning as guiding principle. The analysis resulted in six themes, which explains why the public service procurements of municipalities face problems. The themes are market, political influence, the change of local authority institution, the service provider, the mentality and skills. The themes explicate clearly the thematic areas in which the challenges in public service procurement occur. The problems local authorities face in public service procurement become apparent in the empirical data in a way, which shows that service procurement, procurement culture and procurement environment of local authorizes hover in between old and new. Through the themes explaining the problems in service procurement a core idea and concept of the study was formed: the change in local authorities service procurement, which describes the transition from old procurement culture and environment to new one. The change in local authorities service procurement can be divided into three distinct changes, which rise from the interpretation of research analysis. Local authorities service procurement is in transition in three dimensions which are structural change, operational change and change of control system. Structural change consists of merger of local authorities and establishing new <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>bodies</b> among others. In the background of structural change is also increasing of inter-municipal cooperation. Operational change can be described with slogans from government to governance and from competitive tendering to procurement partnerships. The change of control system is based on co-operation and partnerships between municipalities and suppliers The study resulted in an overall picture of local authorities service procurements problems and the causes why problems occur. The presence of the three elements in local authorities service procurement was clearly shown. The elements are: the bureaucratic and legalistic decision-making and its preparation, which constitute the formal public procurement process and at the same the bureaucratic wall which is built around the local authority during the tendering process; the competitive element, which consists of trading on the open market and; governance networks, which base on partnerships and co-operation between local authorities and suppliers. When unwinding the study results and the core category into themes that are included in the change in local authorities service procurement, all the themes can be located in the above described elements and into the friction which is created in the interface of them. The friction of the three elements shows also the large transition that municipalities are facing in their operations and operation environment, which can be seen both in the theoretical discussion and in re-scaling of municipalities. When the change in local authorities service procurement is seen in the light of theories of public administration, new public management and governance, the true core of the change is revealed. Old, but at the same time preserving represents the bureaucratic and legalistic administration. Old and at the same time fading paradigm is the NPM, which still describe the change of management in municipalities, but which does not as a whole describe the municipalities operating environment. The new is represented by governance theories, which reflects one of the core issues of the change in local authorities service procurement: networks and partnerships. The friction surfaces of the elements that describe the change in local authorities service procurement also change the operating environment where local authorities purchase services. They reinforce the partnerships between the local authorities and suppliers within networks, as well as the governance networks in general as the ground for public procurement of services. The change in local authorities service procurement also include the re-scaling of municipalities and the re-drawing of the municipal borders in terms of networks in circumstances where municipalities as institution itself are undergoing change...|$|E

Our approach aims at reconciling the most recent developments in auction theory with the more practicalissues arising in centralized public procurement. In lowest price competitive tendering, we argue that, by lowering the reserve price, a (national) <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>body</b> may reduce the purchasing cost at the expense of participation. Instead, if the contract is awarded by means of a scoring auction, the objectives of participation and cost reduction do not necessarily conflict with each other. reserve price; public contracts; <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> body; scoring auctions...|$|R

It {{operates}} as Italy's <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>body,</b> and implements the programme for the rationalisation of public spending on goods and services {{through the use of}} ICT (Information and Communication Technology) and innovative procurement tools, such as framework contracts, e-marketplace for public administration, and a dynamic purchasing system. Italy's National Action Plan (NAP) on green public procurement (GPP) entered into force in 2008 and, since then, GPP {{has been one of the}} pillars of Consip's Rationalisation Programme. Consip's mission is to make the use of public resources more efficient and transparent, by providing tools and support to public administrations which enable them to carry out procurement procedures which foster competitive participation from enterprises. The objectives were to tender for a framework contract for print and copy management services for use by the entire Italian public sector. Consip's aim was to move away from single user printers and copiers which lead to a great deal of printing and thus higher costs. A mechanism called Click & Save (please note that this is not a brand name) was sought through the procurement, as it is a means for rewarding less printing. The framework contract also covered an optional service to manage leased office equipment (printers, photocopiers and fax machines). During the pre-procurement phase, a number of interviews were carried out with potential suppliers to discuss Energy Star requirements, design for disassembly and noise requirements...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the suppliers’ view of their relation to Stora Enso. The study focuses on the relation between the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit of Stora Enso and the suppliers but also gives indications of how the overall interface between Stora Enso and the suppliers works. The purpose is explored through a number of research objectives, which are presented below. Areas essential for the functioning of the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit: - The overall organisation of Stora Enso’s purchasing activities, - Stora Enso’s cross-functional purchasing teams, - The internal coordination and communication, - The relational bonds between Stora Enso and the suppliers Important goals and visions for the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit: - Minimising the Total Business Cost, - Being an attractive partner to the suppliers Currently discussed issues within the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> organisation: - The potential for closer cooperation between Stora Enso and the suppliers, - The professionalism of Stora Enso’s purchasers Stora Enso is well organised for purchasing but the centrally coordinated cross-functional teams are not working as well as they could. The internal coordination has improved lately but the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit’s mission to optimise for Stora Enso as a whole often creates tension within the organisation, as a result of the mills being profit centres. The internal communication is not efficient, and the suppliers are strengthening their bonds with the mills by taking over the responsibility for certain information flows. The <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit and the cross-functional teams have the responsibility but not the authority to carry out their task of identifying and reducing the Total Business Cost. Stora Enso is an attractive customer for their suppliers, mainly because of the big volumes they represent. The current negotiation strategies are not advantageous for the introduction of collaborative supplier relations but other factors in the relation between the suppliers and Stora Enso speak strongly in favour for such a strategic change. When it comes to professionalism and business moral the suppliers give the <b>central</b> <b>purchasing</b> unit a very positive evaluation...|$|R
