40|$|<b>Calibration</b> <b>tests</b> are {{of great}} {{importance}} to ensure rate-sensing accuracy of GyroWheel, an innovative attitude determination and control device. In the process of <b>calibration</b> <b>tests,</b> turntable errors are inevitable, which hinder the calibration accuracy and rate-sensing capability. Hence, error analysis for GyroWheel <b>calibration</b> <b>tests</b> is conducted, {{and the relationship between}} the calibration accuracy and the orientation error is established based on analytical derivation and numerical simulations. Subsequently, an error model of the turntable system is derived using rigid body kinematics, by which the relationship between the orientation error and turntable errors is described. According to sensitivity analysis and manufacturing capability, an error allocation method is proposed to determine the accuracy requirement of the test turntable, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by repeated simulation tests. Based on the presented analysis and proposed method in this paper, the effects of various turntable errors on the calibration accuracy can be obtained quantitatively, and a theoretical basis for the determination of the turntable accuracy is provided, which are of great significance to guide the <b>calibration</b> <b>tests</b> and improve the calibration accuracy of GyroWheel...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the procedure currently {{applied for the}} calibration of the load cells used for the mechanical experiments in the ELSA laboratory. The procedure {{is based on the}} international norm ISO 7500 - 1 and the definitions there proposed. The calibration experiment consists of applying a number of load cycles simultaneously on the object load cell in series with a traceable measuring proving instrument externally calibrated (reference load cell). The accuracy of the measures of the object load cell is the most important result of the test delimiting the maximum difference between both instruments. Other important results of the test are the resolution, repeatability and reversibility of the object load cell. All these error parameters determine the quality of the object instrument at the state of the <b>calibration</b> <b>test.</b> In order to extend the validity of the <b>calibration</b> <b>test</b> to the experiments performed with that load cell when connected to amplifiers different from the one of the <b>calibration</b> <b>test,</b> an additional gain test of the signal conditioning chain is also undertaken at ELSA after the <b>calibration</b> <b>test.</b> JRC.

40|$|Forecasts {{by nature}} {{should take the}} form of {{probabilistic}} distributions. Calibration, the statistical consistency of forecast distributions and observations, is a central property of good probabilistic forecasts. Calibration of univariate forecasts has been widely discussed, and significance tests are commonly used to investigate whether a prediction model is miscalibrated. However, <b>calibration</b> <b>tests</b> for multivariate forecasts are rare. In this paper, we propose <b>calibration</b> <b>tests</b> for multivariate Gaussian forecasts based on two types of the Dawid–Sebastiani score (DSS) : the multivariate DSS (mDSS) and the individual DSS (iDSS). Analytic results and simulation studies show that the tests have sufficient power to detect miscalibrated forecasts with incorrect mean or incorrect variance. But for forecasts with incorrect correlation coefficients, only the tests based on mDSS are sensitive to miscalibration. As an illustration, we apply the methodology to weekly data on Norovirus disease incidence among males and females in Germany, in 2011 – 2014. The results further show that tests for multivariate forecasts are useful tools and superior to univariate <b>calibration</b> <b>tests</b> for correlated multivariate forecasts...|$|R

40|$|We trained rats in {{a context}} {{discrimination}} paradigm by pairing a sucrose solution with lithium chloride in one context (conditioning context) and simple exposure to the same fluid in a second (neutral) context to establish a context-dependent aversion to the conditioned fluid. We then investigated whether transfer of the context dependency to a <b>test</b> <b>fluid</b> (a sodium chloride solution) was affected by two post-discrimination training treatments, an extended context discrimination training, and non-reinforced exposure to the conditioning context (context extinction). We found that the context-dependent flavor aversion that had been specific to sucrose transferred to the <b>test</b> <b>fluid</b> after the extensive training (Experiment 1). Context extinction eliminated the transfer effect that had been observed immediately after the context discrimination training (Experiment 2). In addition, an aversion acquired by sucrose through a simple conditioning of sucrose-LiCl pairings did not generalize to the <b>test</b> <b>fluid</b> (Experiment 3). These results {{emphasize the importance of}} a Pavlovian excitatory association between the conditioning context and nausea as a primary source of transfer of the context dependency, rather than a generalization of aversion acquired by the conditioned <b>fluid</b> to the <b>test</b> <b>fluid.</b> © 2014 Elsevier B.

For this purpose, the cameras have been flown over large <b>calibration</b> <b>test</b> areas at different flying heights, forward and reverse flight patterns over the same flight line, and different overlaps (end and lateral). Both <b>calibration</b> <b>test</b> sites include a large quantity of control and independent check points used during adjustment and quality control. Several patterns of control point amounts and distributions were tested. All bundle block adjustments were carried out with self-calibration using specifically derived additional parameters for each camera with the purpose of removing possible systematic effects. In relation to the radiometric characteristics, several linear features evenly distributed over the entire area were cross sectioned along edges and their pixel grey shade studied through point spread functions that allow for the derivation of the effective dimension of the ground sample distance. This provides indirect data about the possible loss of information with respect to the theoretical value of the projected pixel size of each camera...|$|R
