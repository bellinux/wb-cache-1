It was raised 1.5 inches for additional ground clearance, 2.5 inch wall-thick square tubing was used to prevent potential roof buckling and added a reinforcing railing {{that doubles as a}} skid plate, an auxiliary braking system designed to assist drivers in controlled spins, the master cylinder was repositioned in the brake line to enable it to feed the rear wheels enabling the driver to lock the aft end on command, and the auxiliary master cylinder utilizes the original master cylinder's reservoir and is installed in series with the outlet of the original master cylinder port leading to the rear wheels. When the stock brake is applied, fluid passes freely through the stunt master cylinder inlet port and <b>compensating</b> <b>port</b> and out the exhaust port to the rear wheels. When the stunt brake is applied, the piston in the master cylinder blocks off the <b>compensating</b> <b>port</b> to the exhaust port and pressurizes the rear brake system, cutting off the original brake master cylinder besides the <b>compensating</b> <b>port</b> in the stunt brake. BF Goodrich TA's were added for enhanced stick, as were Tilton brake calipers. The improved traction required installation of a hydraulic in-line brake power booster lifted from a Volvo P-1800. It operates on engine vacuum to aid in breaking loose the pavement-hugging TA's. To further enhance the growl of the vehicle, Robert's team installed a NOS port-injected nitrous system, which was later replaced with a plate-type configuration. He also replaced the carburetor replacing the stock with a Predator which reduces fuel lag. A Modine all-aluminum four-core radiator was used to guard against Miami's hot weather, and liquid Auto-Meter gauges to monitor the temperature.|$|E
50|$|In a {{hydraulic}} brake system, when the brake pedal is pressed, a pushrod exerts {{force on the}} piston(s) in the master cylinder, causing fluid from the brake fluid reservoir to flow into a pressure chamber through a <b>compensating</b> <b>port.</b> This results {{in an increase in}} the pressure of the entire hydraulic system, forcing fluid through the hydraulic lines toward one or more calipers where it acts upon one or more caliper pistons sealed by one or more seated O-rings (which prevent leakage of the fluid).|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{application}} of a simplified numerical analysis, based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), of the flow field inside the <b>compensated</b> <b>port</b> connections of a reference spool valve. The aim of the study was the evaluation of the proposed analysis procedure, to put in evidence the major effects related to the presence of steady state flow forces affecting the spool equilibrium. Starting from an initial summary of the dimensional analysis proposed by the authors to approach the application of CFD to hydraulic components, the paper presents the results of three commonly used compensating profiles for two reference spool positions. In order to validate the simulation, the curves obtained for one of the three geometries are compared with the experimental data obtained on an equivalent port connection of a commercial distributor...|$|R
2500|$|In Christchurch, the under-quota [...] and [...] electorates took {{population}} from [...] {{in the north}} and from Port Hills in the south. While it was correctly predicted Christchurch East would remain a Labour seat, the prediction that the marginal Christchurch Central electorate would move in Labour's favour proved false; the seat instead swung in National's favour. The loss of Labour-leaning urban parts of Waimakariri made it a safer seat for National, which increased it majority from 642 votes in 2011 to 2,133 in 2014. The Halswell-Oaklands-Westmorland area moved from Selwyn into <b>Port</b> Hills to <b>compensate</b> for <b>Port</b> Hills' loss and to bring Selwyn within quota. As Halswell-Oaklands-Westmorland are predominantly National-leaning, it caused the Labour-held electorate of Port Hills to become more marginal.|$|R
40|$|The {{container}} handling rates at ports are input for container shipping operations planning by shipping lines. The handling rates are unilaterally determined by port operators. This article {{points out that}} it may be possible for port operators to provide higher handling rates at some additional costs. The higher handling rates will enable ships to have more time sailing at sea, leading to less fuel consumption. The reduction in fuel costs for shipping lines may be more significant than the additional costs incurred by port operators. We therefore propose a practical and easy-to-implement collaborative mechanism between shipping lines and port operators, where the shipping lines <b>compensate</b> the <b>port</b> operators for their additional costs. As a result, the overall efficiency of container transportation is improved. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the incentives for and welfare implications of collaboration among local governments in landside port accessibility investment. In particular, we consider two seaports with their respective captive markets {{and a common}} inland market for which the ports compete. The ports and the inland belong to three independent regional governments, each making investment decisions on accessibility for its own region. We find {{that there is a}} conflict of interest between the port governments and inland government in terms of their jointly making accessibility investment decisions, and that each region's preference over various coalitions is highly affected by ownership type of the competing ports. For public ports, the inland may <b>compensate</b> the <b>port</b> regions to achieve the grand coalition that maximizes total welfare but requires a sizable investment in the port regions. For private ports, however, the port regions benefit from coordinating with the inland and hence may be able to compensate the inland to form the grand coalition.

40|$|Ships that sail at {{high speeds}} emit a higher amount of air {{emissions}} on a per tonne-km basis than ships that go slower. As the goal of environment-friendly shipping is high {{on the agenda of}} the IMO, the European Commission and many individual coastal states, reduction of emissions, both from greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO 2, and also from SOx, NOx, and other gases, is an important and urgent target. One of the obvious operational measures that is contemplated to reduce emissions is speed reduction. As there is a cube law between speed and fuel consumption per day, the higher a shipâ€™s speed is, the more her emissions can be reduced by speed reduction. This is particularly true for high speed craft but also for containerships, RoPax ferries and other ships that go faster than the average. However, a reduction in speed may have undesirable side-effects that may generally entail non-trivial costs. Such side-effects may include the need for more ships in the fleet, increased cargo inventory costs, and others, and collectively may render speed reduction not necessarily cost-effective. Alternatively, one may <b>compensate</b> by reducing <b>port</b> time, to the extent possible. This paper investigates such issues for a variety of ship types at the higher end of the speed spectrum and attempts to identify factors that are important and alternatives that are more cost-effective...|$|R
