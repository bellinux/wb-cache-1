5|$|Meanwhile, Sarah and Casey {{learn that}} Ned is {{unmarried}} and had earlier called Mauser {{rather than his}} wife, as the hostages were led to believe. They follow the ambulance containing <b>Chuck</b> and Mauser and shoot its tires, sending the vehicle into a Christmas tree lot and allowing <b>Chuck</b> to escape. After a brief fight, Mauser surrenders, confident that Fulcrum will rescue him. To protect <b>Chuck,</b> Sarah executes Mauser. Unknown to Sarah, <b>Chuck</b> watches the entire confrontation in horror from afar. She lies to <b>Chuck</b> and tells him that Mauser has been arrested. At the Buy More, Ellie and Morgan's girlfriend Anna Wu (Julia Ling) praise Lester for his act of bravery. Morgan watches as Lester grabs Anna and kisses her, turning away before Anna pulls away from Lester in disgust. The episode closes with both Morgan and <b>Chuck</b> heartbroken, Morgan believing Anna to be unfaithful, and <b>Chuck</b> believing Sarah to be a murderer.|$|E
5|$|Sarah takes <b>Chuck</b> {{on a date}} to {{find out}} what he knows. Sarah spots and quickly dispatches an NSA team {{following}} but flees with <b>Chuck</b> when she spots Casey. Sarah leads <b>Chuck</b> up to the top floor of a skyscraper and attempts to call in an evacuation while <b>Chuck</b> explains what happened when he uploaded the Intersect. Sarah then aims her gun at <b>Chuck</b> when Casey arrives on the roof. Sarah warns Casey that <b>Chuck</b> uploaded the Intersect and tells <b>Chuck</b> that their mutual friend Bryce is dead. <b>Chuck</b> then flashes on the building where the visiting General Stanfield (Dale Dye) is giving an address and puts together all the pieces from the flashes he had been having: the stranger in the Large Mart is a demolitions expert and has set a bomb to destroy the conference. <b>Chuck,</b> Sarah, and Casey locate the bomb in the conference hall and <b>Chuck</b> defuses the bomb by deliberately infecting the machine with a computer virus.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Chuck</b> returns, he and Ellie {{tell each}} other the truth, with Ellie {{revealing}} that she is still investigating her father's research, and <b>Chuck</b> revealing that {{he is still a}} CIA agent. <b>Chuck</b> then brings Ellie to Castle and demonstrates martial arts skills from the Intersect. When <b>Chuck</b> claims to be Agent X, the first human Intersect, Ellie informs him that, according to the laptop, someone had originally uploaded the Intersect to their brain before Chuck's birth. After <b>Chuck</b> repairs the computer, they find a redacted file on British scientist Hartley Winterbottom.|$|E

50|$|Commercial {{production}} machining {{now makes}} use of increasingly advanced <b>chucks</b> which have not only indexable positioning but also indexable clamping. Both functions are typically hydraulically controlled. The clamping is often done with each pair of jaws consisting of one fixed jaw and one movable jaw (hydraulically actuated), thematically similar to advanced milling vises. This method of clamping brings the high precision and repeatability of such vises to a <b>chucking</b> application. Such <b>chucks</b> offer the centering precision of traditional independent-jaw <b>chucks</b> with the <b>chucking</b> speed and ease of traditional three-jaw self-centering scroll <b>chucks.</b> They have expensive initial cost (compared with traditional <b>chucks),</b> but such initial cost pays for itself and then lowers ongoing marginal costs in commercial production-run environments.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>chucks,</b> such as {{magnetic}} <b>chucks</b> and vacuum <b>chucks,</b> are of {{a different}} sort from the radially symmetrical mechanical clamps mentioned above.

While looking for Charlie at the loft, Vanessa spots Dan's novel and reads it. Dan calls her and is upset that she has been reading the novel, which she suggests that he publish despite the possible backlash. Realizing that he no longer cares about writing, Vanessa steals the novel after Dan angrily dismisses her. Serena stops Charlie from jumping off a window and Charlie expresses her envy towards Serena, aspiring to be like her until Serena admits her personal flaws to Charlie, who comforts her. Dan and Nate find Charlie and Serena and return to the party. Charlie makes a suspicious call to her mother and piques Georgina's interest, who gives her her number. Blair finds herself in a dilemma as her feelings for <b>Chuck</b> have resurfaced, arriving at the party to inform Louis of her decision but <b>Chuck</b> interrupts her, informing him that he has their blessing. Blair confronts <b>Chuck</b> for making a decision for her, but the two eventually settle their issues, and he lets her go.|$|E

40|$|Significant {{improvements}} {{have been}} made in the performance of CNC machine tools due to the active research over the last several decades. However, the research and understanding on <b>chucking</b> accuracy have not been adequate. Nor has any systematic methods been reported for on <b>chucking</b> accuracy, especially in terms of the repeatability and the accuracy in the position of a <b>chucked</b> workpiece. The needs for the improvements in <b>chucking</b> accuracy has been existed since <b>chucking</b> has been the bottleneck in the form accuracy of a workpiece as the accuracy of machine tools improved significantly over the last several decades. However, the need was not very strong since turning has not been considered as the finishing process for the production of precision mechanical components such as bearings and shafts. After recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of hard turning in terms of surface integrity over other abrasive machining processes as a finishing process, a strong need emerged to improve <b>chucking</b> accuracy to enable the implementation of finish hard turning for the production of precision mechanical components. In this study, systematic methods for improving the accuracy and repeatability in the position of a <b>chucked</b> workpiece have been sought. Factors affecting the positioning accuracy and repeatability of a <b>chucked</b> workpiece have been identified. In addition, the characteristics of these factors, as well as their effect on <b>chucking</b> accuracy, were given.

50|$|An {{automatic}} <b>chucking</b> {{machine is}} very similar to an automatic screw machine, except it handles larger work, which due to its size is more often <b>chucking</b> work and less often bar work. The Fay automatic lathe was a variant that specialized in turning work on centers. While a screw machine is limited to around 80 mm practice, automatic chuckers are available that can handle up to 300 mm <b>chucks.</b> The <b>chucks</b> are air-operated. Many of these machines are multispindle (more than one main spindle).|$|R
5|$|Blair {{eventually}} {{decides that}} she wants to be with <b>Chuck,</b> but shuns him once again after he tries to humiliate Dan. She is later courted by a prince from Monaco named Louis. During a private confrontation, a drunken <b>Chuck</b> punches a window after he finds out Prince Louis has proposed to Blair, which cuts Blair's face as it shatters. Afterward, Blair chooses to accept a proposal from Louis. Blair later attempts to warn <b>Chuck</b> about potential trouble in his family. She is then abducted by an enemy of the Basses, Raina's father Russell Thorpe. <b>Chuck</b> later rescues Blair and apologizes for his violent actions. Following a night out together, the two have sex before <b>Chuck</b> advises Blair to return to Louis, believing that she will be happier with him.

40|$|A strong need {{has existed}} {{to develop a}} hard turning process that can replace {{grinding}} as a finishing process, due to its huge benefits in surface integrity and manufacturing flexibility over finish grinding and superfinishing. Due to the significant advances in machine tool accuracy and cutting tool material properties, <b>chucking,</b> {{which has not been}} improved significantly over the last several decades, has become the weakest link in the whole machine processing system. However, the understanding of <b>chucking</b> accuracy is lacking, nor is any systematic research on the improvement of <b>chucking</b> accuracy is available in literature. In this study, methods which enable evaluating, and improving <b>chucking</b> accuracy of a cylindrical workpiece were developed. This study performed systematic error identification and the analyses of the characteristics of the factors that affect <b>chucking</b> accuracy. Then, the formulations of the relation between the measurable factors and the <b>chucking</b> error were carried out as well as a <b>chucking</b> error map. From these analyses and formulations, methods for compensating the error components on <b>chucking</b> accuracy were developed. The methods were tested using the rings of a taper-roller bearing. From the tests of the methods, it was proven that hard turning alone, without any other finishing process such as grinding, can satisfy the same level of form accuracy that is currently achieved by finish grinding. With the developed <b>chucking</b> methods and strategies, the concentricity error could be reduced significantly or eliminated. For the case studied, we achieved about 20 times improvement in concentricity and 30 times in repeatability. The knowledge, created by this research on the improvement of <b>chucking</b> accuracy, can be applied to other operations requiring precision holding of a workpiece or a tool, as well as to general turning operations. ...|$|R
