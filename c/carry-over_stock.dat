[...] In India, {{according}} to the Famine Commission's, Final Report, [...] "the areas most affected were parts of the provinces of Bombay and Madras and the States of Cochin and Travancore." [...] The imports from Burma normally met India's supply deficit in rice, which totaled 1,750,000 tons. In Bengal, the net import for which actual receipts and despatch documents existed, was on average 50,000 tons annually for 1932–1937, [...] and 159,000 tons annually for 1938–42, the highest levels being recorded for the years 1934 and 1939 at 364,000 tons and 382,000 tons respectively. [...] But, according to the Final Report, there was also unrecorded import into Bengal [...] "by country boat from Assam and from Arakan in Burma" [...] the extent of which was not known accurately. [...] The Commission proposed that this import was {{of the order of}} 50,000 tons annually for 1932–1937 and 100,000 tons annually for 1938–1942. [...] Aggregate consumption was also computed, not by a direct approach using census-based population statistics whose margin of error was too high, but by indirect estimation from a combination of the available values of annual supply, net import, <b>carry-over</b> <b>stock</b> at the year's beginning, and the same at the year's end. [...] However, as <b>carry-over</b> <b>stock</b> in any individual year could not be accurately estimated, averages were computed for a longer periods under the expectation that the <b>carry-over</b> <b>stock</b> at {{the beginning and the end}} of the periods were negligible compared to the total consumption during the periods. [...] The commission also made adjustments in annual supply, which had errors stemming from the assessment of cultivated acreage under the permanent settlement in Bengal. In this way, average consumption for the 15-year period 1928 to 1942 was computed to be 8.14 million tons annually for unadjusted acreage, and 9.18 million tons for the adjusted. Annual consumption was then estimated by assuming that it veered off the unadjusted average by increments, or decrements, of 0.10 million tons every year, and off the adjusted average by those of 0.12 million tons. [...] Using these data in the Famine Inquiry Commission report, the percentage of net imports—either recorded only, or both recorded and unrecorded, computed relative to a 15-year- or 5-year time period, and to consumption- or supply averages, which were either unadjusted or adjusted—were found by scholars to be 1.1% and 1.4% in one instance, and [...] "less than 4%" [...] in another. Using different data, P. C. Mahalanobis estimated the net imports to be on average 1% of aggregate supply for the period 1934–39, estimating their highest value for a single year at 5% for 1934, and noting that [...] "the physical quantities of net imports was never large." [...] While acknowledging that the influx of Burma rice was a factor in stabilizing prices, as it prevented hoarding or cornering the market, he concluded that there was [...] "chronic but a growing shortage of rice in Bengal," [...] which had not affected prices or imports because a large number of people, lacking the money to buy enough food, often made do with less than what was enough.|$|E

This paper describes a computer simulation of the inventory situation over an eight-year period, which is being used to assess the relationship between order flexibility and the target <b>carry-over</b> <b>stocks</b> {{at the beginning of each}} shipping season. A simple way of presenting the results for management evaluation is illustrated. Variations of the model are used to assess random influences, such as strikes, and to determine the economic balance between holding costs and stock-outs. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study is to understand the recent trends in demand for wild blueberries with particular attention to the effects of production and the marketing of wild and cultivated blueberries. A price response model was developed to analyze farm-gate price and the processor price, using annual data from 1978 through 1997. Key explanatory variables in the model include quantity of wild blueberries, real per capita disposable income, the quantity of processed cultivated blueberries, and <b>carry-over</b> <b>stocks</b> of frozen blueberries.

40|$|Many anticancer {{drugs have}} an {{impaired}} bioavailability and poor brain penetration {{because they are}} substrates to drug efflux pumps such as P-glycoprotein and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein. Elacridar is a strong inhibitor of these two drug efflux pumps and therefore has great potential to improve oral absorption and brain penetration of many anticancer drugs. Currently, a clinical formulation of elacridar is unavailable and therefore the pharmaceutical development of a drug product is highly warranted. This also necessitates the availability of an analytical method for its quality control. A reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection was developed for the pharmaceutical quality control of products containing elacridar as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. The analytical method was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, selectivity, <b>carry-over,</b> stability of <b>stock</b> and reference solutions, stability of the final extract, stability-indicating capability and impurity testing. We found that elacridar is unstable in aqueous solutions that are exposed to light because a hydroxylation product of elacridar is formed. Therefore, sample solutions with elacridar must be protected from light...|$|R
40|$|According to this USDA report, in 2002 / 03 EU sugar {{production}} rose 15 % to 18. 66 million tonnes. Indications {{are that}} the area under sugar has been reduced by 6. 5 % {{in response to a}} cut in sugar quotas in 2002 / 2003 and higher <b>carry-over</b> of <b>stocks.</b> Production in 2003 / 04 is projected to be 17. 4 million tonnes (raw sugar equivalent) under normal growing conditions. In October 2002 in response to WTO limits on EU sugar export subsidies and weak prices during most of 2002 the European Commission reduced sugar quotas by 7 % for the 2002 / 03 season. This cut of roughly 900, 000 tonnes came well after the 2002 / 03 crop had been sown, and so had no impact on overall production, but rather increased the level of 'C' sugar production. With this largely carried over to the following year, reduced planting for 2003 / 04 resulted. In 2001 / 02 EU imports of sugar increased to 2. 087 million tonnes raw sugar equivalent, with Serbia and Montenegro entering as the fifth largest source of imports. The opening up of the EU market to duty-free access from the western Balkans accounts for the increase in imports as the high-priced EU market sucks in imports. This however is mainly in the form of refined sugar. In outlining the EU's import arrangements the USDA analysis quotes an ISO (International Sugar Organisation) study which, under conservative assumptions, projects imports of 1 million tons of raw sugar equivalent by 2009 from least developed countries, with this rising to 2. 9 million tonnes if expensive infrastructure investments occurred in these countries. The analysis reviews the basis for the extension of the EU sugar regime to new member states and the likely implications of such a move, most notably an expected increase in the EU's structural surplus of sugar. It notes that enlargement is increasing the pressure for an early reform of the sugar regime, since it will be much harder to reach a consensus on reform amongst 25 governments than amongst 15. However it is noted that budget limits will seriously constrain the reform options open to the EU, given {{the extent to which the}} current costs of the sugar regime are borne by EU consumers. Comment: EU 'C' sugar exports (sugar exported without a direct export subsidy) in 2002 / 03 at 3. 256 million tonnes once again exceeded EU sugar exports receiving a direct export subsidy which were 2. 348 million tonnes. In terms of imports from least developed countries it is not clear to what extent ISO projections take into account likely scenarios for reform of the EU sugar regime, for as the report notes least developed countries 'are not the lowest cost producers on the world market' and they may therefore 'find it difficult to compete if EU prices are lowered as a result of sugar reform'. According to this USDA report, in 2002 / 03 EU sugar production rose 15 % to [...] ...|$|R
