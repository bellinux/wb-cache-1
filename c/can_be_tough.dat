2500|$|... 'Hayward' is {{the most}} {{commonly}} available cultivar in stores. It is a large, egg-shaped fruit with a sweet flavor. 'Saanichton 12', from British Columbia, is somewhat more rectangular than 'Hayward' and comparably sweet, but the inner core of the fruit <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough.</b> 'Blake' can self-pollinate, {{but it has a}} smaller, more oval fruit and the flavor is considered inferior.|$|E
2500|$|A {{cell wall}} is a {{structural}} layer surrounding some types of cells, situated outside the cell membrane. It <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough,</b> flexible, and sometimes rigid. It provides the cell with both structural support and protection, and also acts as a filtering mechanism. Cell walls are present in most prokaryotes (except mycoplasma bacteria), in algae, plants and fungi but rarely in other eukaryotes including animals. [...] A major function is to act as pressure vessels, preventing over-expansion of the cell when water enters.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{months after}} {{wrapping}} the film, Bogart and Bacall were reunited for an encore, the film noir The Big Sleep, {{based on the}} novel by Raymond Chandler, again with script help from William Faulkner. Chandler thoroughly admired Bogart's performance: [...] "Bogart <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> without a gun. Also, he has a sense of humor that contains that grating undertone of contempt." [...] The film was completed and slated for release in 1945, then withdrawn and substantially re-edited to add new, juiced-up scenes exploiting both the box office chemistry that shone between Bogart and Bacall in To Have and Have Not, and the notoriety of their personal relationship.|$|E

Nor is it in using racial or religious symbols to create controversy. That only makes the situation worse. It is not the role of politicians to play fast and loose with symbols of difference, especially when they drive the political centre of gravity to the right as a consequence." ...|$|R

2500|$|Said Steve Kroft on the May 8, 2011, {{edition of}} 60 Minutes, [...] "For {{more than a}} decade, bin Laden managed to elude the U.S. {{military}} and intelligence establishments, and he taunted three U.S. presidents. That finally ended last Sunday, {{and the last thing}} bin Laden saw was a Navy SEAL in the third floor bedroom of his compound in Pakistan." [...] According to The Economist, [...] "The silence of the usual critics of 'illegal', 'extrajudicial', targeted killing in the wake of America's killing of Osama bin Laden might reflect hypocrisy, sure. But this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>tough</b> to distinguish from resignation to the fact that Mr Obama didn't submit his case for executing Mr bin Laden to some global civil authority because there isn't one and he didn't have to—because America's the biggest kid on the block and, ultimately, what America says goes. And, if it comes down to it, Britain, France, Italy, Russia and other powerful governments hope America will indulge their own kill-squad adventures with similar approving silences. Of course, if some aggrieved faction in the future seeks retribution through the targeted killing of one of these countries' leaders, that will be raw vengeance, that will be terrorism, that will be an international crime, because, like it or not, that's how it works." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinctive}} dark flesh {{color is}} due to the presence of anthocyanins, a family of antioxidant pigments common to many flowers and fruit, but uncommon in citrus fruits. Chrysanthemin (cyanidin 3-O-glucoside) is the main compound found in red oranges. The flesh develops its characteristic maroon color when the fruit develops with low temperatures during the night. [...] Sometimes, dark coloring is seen on the exterior of the rind, as well, depending on the variety of blood orange. The skin <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> and harder to peel than that of other oranges. Blood oranges have a unique flavor profile compared to other oranges, being distinctly raspberry-like in addition to the usual citrus notes.|$|R

50|$|This is a {{somewhat}} less common variation of murga punishment. In this {{the heels of}} the person should remain in contact. It <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> either sitting or standing. This is a very severe form of Murga, and is impossible to maintain for too long. As a result, the inevitable shorter duration of the punishment reduces the effect of the additional severity to some extent. Moreover, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> to monitor as the punisher has {{to keep an eye on}} the punishee's heels to make sure they are being kept together. If a severe punishment is intended and regular sitting murga is not enough, then standing murga is generally the preferred option rather than sitting murga with heels touching.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of credit default swaps (CDS), a major type of over-thecounter derivative, on the {{corporate}} liquidity management of the reference firms. CDS help firms to access the credit market since the lenders can hedge their credit risk more easily using these contracts. However, CDS-protected creditors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>tougher</b> in debt renegotiations and less willing to support distressed borrowers, causing some firms to become more cautious. Consequently, we find that firms hold significantly more cash after the inception of CDS trading on their debt. The increase in cash holdings by CDS firms is more pronounced for financially constrained firms and firms facing higher refinancing risk. Moreover, bank relationships and outstanding credit facilities intensify the CDS effect on cash holding. Finally, firms with greater financial expertise hold more cash when their debt is referenced by CDS. These findings suggest that CDS, which are primarily a risk management tool for lenders, induce firms to adopt more conservative liquidity policies...|$|R
