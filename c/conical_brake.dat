50|$|The 1st {{downhill}} time-trial race {{took place}} in Fairfax, California on October 21, 1976 on a fireroad now referred to as Repack Road, due {{to the need to}} repack the hub brake after each descent. The bikes used were based on cruiser bicycles that had a drum or coaster brake that worked by pedalling backwards. The mechanism operated with a <b>conical</b> <b>brake</b> shoe being wound on a thread in a metal hub. To prevent the brake from seizing it was kept filled with grease. Heavy use during the descent would cause the brake to over heat, softening the grease and causing it to drain from the hub, requiring frequent repacking. Ten riders descended 1300 ft of Repack road in about 5 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Single-speed or two speed motors are {{designed}} for coupling to gear motor system gearboxes. <b>Conical</b> rotor <b>brake</b> motors are also used to power micro speed drives.|$|R
50|$|Motors of {{this type}} {{can also be found}} on {{overhead}} cranes and hoists. The micro speed unit combines two motors and an intermediate gear reducer. These are used for applications where extreme mechanical positioning accuracy and high cycling capability are needed. The micro speed unit combines a “main” <b>conical</b> rotor <b>brake</b> motor for rapid speed and a “micro” <b>conical</b> rotor <b>brake</b> motor for slow or positioning speed. The intermediate gearbox allows a range of ratios, and motors of different speeds can be combined to produce high ratios between high and low speed.|$|R
50|$|The Mars 2 descent module {{was mounted}} on the bus/orbiter {{opposite}} the propulsion system. It consisted of a spherical 1.2 m diameter landing capsule, a 2.9 m diameter <b>conical</b> aerodynamic <b>braking</b> shield, a parachute system and retro-rockets.|$|R
50|$|The high {{starting}} torque and low inertia of the <b>conical</b> rotor <b>brake</b> motor {{has proven to}} be ideal for the demands of high cycle dynamic drives in applications since the motor was invented, designed and introduced over 50 years ago. This type of motor configuration was first introduced in the USA in 1963.|$|R
50|$|A <b>conical</b> rotor <b>brake</b> motor {{incorporates}} the brake {{as an integral}} part of the conical sliding rotor. When the motor is at rest, a spring acts on the sliding rotor and forces the brake ring against the brake cap in the motor, holding the rotor stationary. When the motor is energized, its magnetic field generates both an axial and a radial component. The axial component overcomes the spring force, releasing the brake; while the radial component causes the rotor to turn. There is no additional brake control required.|$|R
40|$|Performances {{of three}} types of heat protectors predicted. Estimates of {{expected}} performances of heat shields for <b>conical</b> drag <b>brake</b> presented in paper. Drag brakes, or aerobrakes, being considered as devices for slowing space vehicles when they return to Space Shuttle altitudes from higher satellite altitudes after supply missions. Aerobrakes add less weight than do retro-rockets for same purpose and consume no fuel. Paper provides general information on sensitivity of performance to thermal and physical properties of materials used in aerobrakes. Information useful to both designers of brakes and developers of materials for brake fabrication on aerospace structures...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from an on-going {{study of the}} thermal performance of thermal protection systems for a <b>conical</b> drag <b>brake</b> type AOTV. Three types of heatshield are considered: rigid ceramic insulation, flexible ceramic blankets, and ceramic cloths. The results for the rigid insulation apply to other types of AOTV as well. Charts {{are presented}} in parametric form {{so that they may}} be applied to a variety of missions and vehicle configurations. The parameters considered include: braking maneuver heat flux and total heat load, heatshield material and thickness, heatshield thermal mass and conductivity, absorptivity and emissivity of surfaces, thermal mass of support structure, and radiation transmission through thin heatshields. Results of temperature calculations presented show trends with and sensitivities to these parameters. The emphasis is on providing information that will be useful in estimating the minimum required mass of these heatshield materials...|$|R
5000|$|The {{heart of}} the SV-98 is a cold-hammer forged {{receiver}} and a cold-hammer forged free-floating heavy barrel which can be chrome lined to order. The manually operated bolt action has a rotating bolt with three symmetrically-spaced frontal lugs. The barrel has 4 grooves right-hand rifling and a 320 mm (1 in 12.6 in) twist rate and features a threaded muzzle which can accept the standard provided <b>conical</b> birdcage-pattern muzzle <b>brake</b> or a specially designed 23db (A) suppressor that {{requires the use of}} subsonic ammunition. The rifle was developed to fire 7.62×54mmR 7N1 standard sniper, 7N14 enhanced penetration sniper or [...] "Extra" [...] match grade sports cartridges.|$|R
40|$|A {{subsurface}} explorer (SSX) {{for exploring}} beneath the terrestrial surface of planetary bodies {{such as the}} Earth, Mars, or comets. This exploration activity utilizes appropriate sensors and instrument to evaluate the composition, structure, mineralogy and possibly biology of the subsurface medium, as well as perhaps the ability to return samples of that medium back to the surface. The vehicle comprises an elongated skin or body having a front end and a rear end, with a nose piece at the front end for imparting force to composition material of the planetary body. Force is provided by a hammer mechanism to {{the back side of}} a nose piece from within the body of the vehicle. In the preferred embodiment, a motor spins an intermediate shaft having two non-uniform threads along with a hammer which engages these threads with two <b>conical</b> rollers. A <b>brake</b> assembly halts the rotation of the intermediate shaft, causing the conical roller to spin down the non-uniform thread to rapidly and efficiently convert the rotational kinetic energy of the hammer into translational energy...|$|R
5000|$|Launched in 1971 the 5-speed, [...] double {{overhead}} cam twin cylinder Triumph Bandit delivered [...] and could reach 110 mph. Essentially the same motorcycle as the BSA Fury, the Bandit represented the factory's last attempt {{to compete against}} Japanese imports.The only contemporary road test was by American magazine Cycle Guide in their March 1971 issue upon {{a visit to the}} Triumph and BSA factories at Meriden and Small Heath, respectively. The Bandit's petrol tank colour scheme was Cypress Green (although Cycle World identified it as Jealous Green [...] ) with white-lined black scallops above and below a metal Triumph badge with a chrome styling strip running down the top of the tank. The same paint scheme applied to the mudguards with a white-lined black stripe running down through their centre. The side panels were silver painted with black 'tombstone' style lettering stating the model name and engine size: 'Bandit 350'. The engine was all-alloy as opposed to Triumph's other twins that relied upon an iron barrel and considered by Cycle Guide to be 'beautifully finished' and 'a real thing of beauty'. Cycle Guide criticised the retention of a traditionally Triumph vertically split crankcase halves rather than adopting the Japanese practice of horizontally splitting them. Despite this, it was noted that the engine was oil tight. The small diameter instruments and foot pegs thought mounted too far forward came in for criticism as did the poor <b>conical</b> hub rear <b>brake</b> performance, unlike the 'great' front brake. Lever travel between gears was felt to be too long although the clutch operation was 'silky smooth'. The electrical system was twin coil and 12 volt and an electric starter was offered as an option. Carburetion was by two Amal 27mm carburetors. Cycle Guide were disappointed that the engine could not be expanded beyond 350cc but praised the engine's and exhausts' quietness. Two exhaust systems, a low level ('T35R') and high level (the 'T35SS' Street Scrambler version), were offered, the former offering more top speed. The low level exhaust system was finished in bright chrome, the high level system in matt black with a stainless steel heat shield. The T35SS version also came with what the brochure described as 'detachable electrics'. Tyres for both versions were the same, Dunlop K70; 3.25 x 18 inches for the front and 3.50 x 18 inches for the rear. Compression ratio was also the same for both : 9.5:1.|$|R
