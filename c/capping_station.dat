The complexities of the dynamic process embedded in a Combat Air Patrol management are modeled by means of a deterministic macro model.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} fair weather {{atmospheric}} electric field signatures of three major solar energetic charged particle events which occurred in on 15 April 2001, 18 April and 4 November, and their causative solar flares/coronal mass ejections (SF/CMEs). Only the 15 April 2001 shows clear evidence for Ez variation associated to SF/CME {{events and the}} other two events may support this hypothesis as well although for them the meteorological data were not available. All three events seem to be associated with relativistic solar protons (i. e. protons with energies &gt; 450 MeV) of the Ground Level Event (GLE) type. The study presents data on variations of the vertical component of the atmospheric electric field (Ez) measured at the auroral station Apatity (geomagnetic latitude: 63. 8 &deg;, the polar <b>cap</b> <b>station</b> Vostok (geomagnetic latitude: &minus; 89. 3 &deg;) and the middle latitude stations Voyeikovo (geomagnetic latitude: 56. 1 &deg;) and Nagycenk (geomagnetic latitude: 47. 2 &deg;). A significant disturbance in the atmospheric electric field is sometimes observed close to the time of the causative solar flare; the beginning of the electric field perturbation at Apatity is detected one or two hours before the flare onset and the GLE onset.

40|$|In {{the declining}} {{phase of the}} solar cycle, when the new-polarity fields of the solar poles are {{strengthened}} by the transport of same-signed magnetic flux from lower latitudes, the polar coronal holes expand and form non-axisymmetric extensions toward the solar equator. These extensions enhance the occurrence of high-speed solar wind streams (HSS) and related co-rotating interaction regions in the low-latitude heliosphere, and cause moderate, recurrent geomagnetic activity in the near-Earth space. Here, using a novel definition of geomagnetic activity at high (polar cap) latitudes and the longest record of magnetic observations at a polar <b>cap</b> <b>station,</b> we calculate the annually averaged solar wind speeds as proxies for the effective annual occurrence of HSS over the whole Grand Modern Maximum (GMM) from 1920 s onwards. We find that a period of high annual speeds (frequent occurrence of HSS) occurs in the declining phase of each solar cycle 16 - 23. For most cycles the HSS activity clearly maximizes during one year, suggesting that typically only one strong activation leading to a coronal hole extension {{is responsible for the}} HSS maximum. We find that the most persistent HSS activity occurred in the declining phase of solar cycle 18. This suggests that cycle 19, which marks the sunspot maximum period of the GMM, was preceded by exceptionally strong polar fields during the previous sunspot minimum. This gives interesting support for the validity of solar dynamo theory during this dramatic period of solar magnetism. Comment: to be published in Astrophys. Journa...|$|R

We examine the wind patterns {{as a function of}} magnetic local time and latitude, solar cycle, day of year, and the dawn-dusk and north-south components of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF B y and B z). In magnetic coordinates, the quiet time high-latitude wind patterns are dominated by antisunward flow over the polar cap, with wind speeds that generally increase with increasing solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiation. The winds are generally stronger during equinox than during winter, particularly over the South Pole in the direction of eastern longitudes. IMF B y exerts a strong influence on the wind patterns, particularly in the midnight sector. During winter, B y positive winds around midnight in the northern (southern) hemisphere are directed more toward the dusk (dawn) sector, compared to corresponding B y negative winds; this behavior is consistent with the B y -dependence of statistical ionospheric convection patterns. The strength of the wind response to B y tends to increase with increasing solar EUV irradiation, roughly in proportion to the increased wind speeds. Quiet time B y effects are detectable at latitudes as low as that of Millstone Hill (magnetic latitude 53 °N). Quiet time B z effects are negligible except over the magnetic polar <b>cap</b> <b>station</b> of Thule...|$|R
