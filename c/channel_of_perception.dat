40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the association between}} cortisol secretion and fear perception in remitted patients to identify mechanisms underlying risk for recurrence of depression. We hypothesized that the stronger the association between cortisol secretion and fear perception in persons with remitted depression, the more recurrence would be experienced. We also investigated whether high levels of cortisol and fear perception per se predict more recurrence. These effects were assumed to be stronger in women than in men. In a prospective design, we investigated 77 outpatients with remitted depression and related the association between their 24 -hour urinary free cortisol secretion and fear perception (from ambiguous faces and from vocal expressions) to recurrence of depression within 2 years. We applied Cox regression models, partial correlations, and Fisher z tests. In 21 patients, depression recurred. Irrespective the <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> (eye or ear), the interaction between fear perception and cortisol secretion {{was significantly related to}} recurrence of depression. Patients high or low on both variables are more at risk. This increased risk was also reflected by a significant association between cortisol secretion and facial fear perception, but only among subjects who experienced recurrence. A trend in the same direction was found for vocal fear perception. Fear perception and cortisol secretion per se did not predict recurrence. No gender differences were found. The association between cortisol secretion and fear perception (probably indicative for altered fear circuits in the brain) constitutes a mechanism underlying risk for recurrence of depression...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWith this paper, {{we propose}} and test on {{empirical}} case studies a new {{method of analysis}} of the form of urban fabric from the pedestrian point of view, mixing the relations considered by classical urban morphology with the computational possibilities of geoprocessing. We consider the two main activities that humans do in the space simultaneously: walking and perceiving the urban landscape. As a consequence, {{we will be able}} to analyze the interaction between form elements combined with their geometrical description. At the same time, we will stop short of applying the configurational calculus (whether SSx or MCA) and of studying urban form perception as revealed by mental maps of city dwellers (Lynch 1960). Unlike classical urban morphology, we will consider that urban form is not observed on a plan or as an aerial view, but from the pedestrian perspective. A new spatial unit definition will follow: this new space element is determined by the urban network segment (representing human movement and the main <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> of urban form) concurrently with its surrounding space limited to a given visual depth. Through this procedure, urban fabric will be defined as spatial patterns filtered through the possible perception of city users. The proposed approach is particularly powerful, as it allows computing on a larger scale and with geoprocessing methods what in previous research had been done manually or limited to a local urban project scale. Expert judgment becomes less crucial in the characterization of urban fabric (an advantage when the study area is a vast metropolitan area) and the bottom-up approach, by identifying spatial patterns through geostatistical analysis of form elements in the context of their surrounding environment, eliminates the problem of statistical analysis on pre-defined administrative boundaries...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Modern {{engineers}} must possess {{high potential}} of cognitive abilities, in particular, the algorithmic thinking (AT). In this regard, {{the training of}} future experts (university graduates) of technical specialities has to provide the knowledge of principles and ways of designing of various algorithms, abilities to analyze them, and to choose the most optimal variants for engineering activity implementation. For full formation of AT skills {{it is necessary to}} consider all <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> psychological <b>perception</b> and cogitative processing of educational information: visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. The aim of the present research is theoretical basis of design, development and use of resources for successful development of AT during the educational process of training in programming. Methodology and research methods. Methodology of the research involves the basic thesis of cognitive psychology and information approach while organizing the educational process. The research used methods: analysis; modeling of cognitive processes; designing training tools that take into account the mentality and peculiarities of information perception; diagnostic efficiency of the didactic tools. Results. The three-level model for future engineers training in programming aimed at development of AT skills was developed. The model includes three components: aesthetic, simulative, and conceptual. Stages to mastering a new discipline are allocated. It is proved that for development of AT skills when training in programming it is necessary to use kinesthetic tools at the stage of mental algorithmic maps formation; algorithmic animation and algorithmic mental maps at the stage of algorithmic model and conceptual images formation. Kinesthetic tools for development of students’ AT skills when training in algorithmization and programming are designed. Using of kinesthetic training simulators in educational process provide the effective development of algorithmic style of thinking and increase the level of understanding and learning of educational material on algorithms and programming. Scientific novelty. The developed tools and methods for developing algorithmic style of thinking during the educational process of training in programming is fundamentally different from existing ones that are aimed at kinesthetic <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> and activation <b>of</b> motor-memory area. According to the latest statistics, over 40 % of people have kinesthetic sensing of the world; however, researchers have not treated this phenomenon in much detail. On the whole, the use efficiency of the didactic means when training graduates of engineering specialties has been proved {{in the course of the}} carried out experiment on kinesthetic tools introduction into educational process with the subsequent diagnostics of the levels of AT skills development, and the quality of training in programming among the students of theSiberianFederalUniversity. Practical significance. The proposed tools and methods for developing algorithmic thinking can be used in the training process in the school course of computer science, as well as university courses of programming of various kinds. The presented kinesthetic tools can be used for other technical and natural-science specialities (e. g. Mathematics) after applying specific content adaptation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Conclusions. Increased {{spectral}} resolution via implementation <b>of</b> perceptual <b>channels</b> with HiRes 120 (PSP) {{would seem to}} provide better <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> music than with standard HiRes, mainly {{from the point of}} view of music appreciation as recorded via the questionnaire. More specific tests are required for appreciation of timbre, preferably by application of protocols based on perceptual attributes using rating scales, which would not be biased by knowledge of music. Objective. The objective of this study was to verify the hypothesis whereby the implementation <b>of</b> perceptual <b>channels</b> in HiRes 120 may lead to an improvement in the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> music, owing to an increase in {{spectral resolution}}. Subjects and methods. Music perception was studied in 12 adult subjects, making a comparison between performance with HiRes 90 and HiRes 120 with perceptual <b>channels.</b> Quality <b>of</b> <b>perception,</b> loudness and rhythm were all assessed via a questionnaire.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of electronic commerce has led {{more and more}} companies to, in addition to using resellers, add the Internet to sell directly to its end customers, something that inevitably will create channel conflict. The way companies handle such conflict is considered an important success factor. The importance of this issue, along {{with the lack of}} research focusing upon it, created the foundation for this study. In addition to the dysfunctional aspects of conflict, this study aimed at capturing the functional aspects of conflict as perceived by management. Hence, the research problem of this thesis was to explore and describe managers' perspectives on conflict in multiple marketing channels, with a focus on the Internet. Based on the literature review, a frame of reference was created comprising both text and a graphical display, which defined the boundaries of this research. An interview guide with open-ended questions was then developed from the frame of reference to address the following issues: 1) the causes <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> conflict; 2) how the seriousness <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> conflict can be assessed; and 3) the approaches {{that can be used to}} reduce channel conflict. A qualitative research approach was adopted and case studies were conducted. The empirical data were collected through personal interviews at Ducati and Scandinavian Airlines. Even though the respondents described some channel conflict, it must be noted that the management of both companies emphasized that they have a very good working relationship with their resellers, although on rare occurrence they have encountered problems. Furthermore, although they had experienced some conflict due to the addition of the Internet, there was no more <b>channel</b> conflict because <b>of</b> the Internet than before that channel was added. In addition, the Internet can in fact reduce channel conflict, as both companies referred to the use of an Extranet for this purpose. Results from this study also indicate that one of the generally accepted causes <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> conflict-differing <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> reality-should be replaced with communication problems, since differing <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> reality seem to be the result of poor communication. Moreover, when assessing whether a channel conflict has positive or negative implications for a company, it seems that one important factor to look at is its impact on the company's brand.

40|$|Violence and {{conflicts}} have characterised electoral processes {{in a number}} of African countries since the mid- 1990 s and created an atmosphere of insecurity. The prevalence of such violence reflected a confluence of factors, including the intensification of the competition for access to the state, perceived as a <b>channel</b> <b>of</b> accumulation. This <b>perception</b> raised the stakes to an unprecedented level during elections as vanquished parties went every length to stake a claim to the spoils. Other factors inducing violence included the poor organisation of elections, government interference in the work of election management bodies (EMBs), the insatiable desire of some presidents to seek third terms in contravention of constitutionally mandated two terms, and in some cases because the electoral model excluded loosing parties from parliament. It is noted further that, contrary to Afro-pessimist claims, African countries are capable of credible elections but this is conditional on adequate attention being paid to critical elements in the electoral process, which rid the process of suspicion of fraud and irregularities...|$|R
40|$|In this work, I {{propose a}} model of visual {{aesthetic}} experience that combines formalist and contextual aspects of aesthetics. The model distinguishes between two modes of processing. First, perceptual processing {{is based on the}} intrinsic form of an artwork, {{which may or may not}} be beautiful. If it is beautiful, a beauty-responsive mechanism is activated in the brain. This bottom-up mechanism is universal amongst humans; it is widespread in the visual brain and responsive across visual modalities. Second, cognitive processing is based on contextual information, such as the depicted content, the intentions of the artist or the circumstances of the presentation of the artwork. Cognitive processing is partially top-down and varies between individuals according to their cultural experience. Processing in the two channels is parallel and largely independent. In the general case, an aesthetic experience is induced if processing in both channels is favorable, i. e., if there is resonance in the perceptual processing <b>channel</b> (aesthetics <b>of</b> <b>perception),</b> and successful mastering in the cognitive processing <b>channel</b> (aesthetics <b>of</b> cognition). I speculate that this combinatorial mechanism has evolved to mediate social bonding between members of a (cultural) group of people. Primary emotions can be elicited via both channels and modulate the degree of the aesthetic experience. Two special cases are discussed. First, in a subset of (post-) modern art, beauty no longer plays a prominent role. Second, in some forms of abstract art, beautiful form can be enjoyed with minimal cognitive processing. The model is applied to examples of Western art. Finally, implications of the model are discussed. In summary, the proposed model resolves the seeming contradiction between formalist perceptual approaches to aesthetic experience, which are based on the intrinsic beauty of artworks, and contextual approaches, which account for highly individual and culturally dependent aspects of aesthetics...|$|R
40|$|Background: The concept <b>of</b> value <b>perception</b> {{is widely}} {{discussed}} in scientific literature {{and it is}} well-known, that channels deliver value to the customer. However, so far {{there has been no}} research about the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>channels,</b> especially the consumer´s <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>channel</b> efficiency. Therefore, this study contributes to the current literature in channel management and it fills an existing research gap. The authors establish a definition of the term 'channel efficiency' and they develop a measuring instrument. For this thesis, the three criteria (1)  shopping enjoyment, (2) interpersonal service quality and (3) price level are taken into consideration for the efficiency calculation. The two <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> interest are physical retail stores and the Internet. The target group is university students. Purpose: To measure and compare the efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>channels</b> 'physical retail store' and 'Internet' from the consumer´s view and thus, to find general patterns <b>of</b> rated <b>channel</b> efficiency. This will be achieved by investigating the individual <b>channel</b> value <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> certain <b>channel</b> specific criteria and by exploring the respective relevance of these criteria.   Research Questions: 1. What is the general <b>channel</b> efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>channel</b> physical retail store? 2. What is the general <b>channel</b> efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>channel</b> Internet? Method: A quantitative study in form of an online questionnaire has been conducted with German and Swedish students. 1 995 persons participated in the survey. The analysis has been carried out by using the computer software SPSS. Thus, the collected data could be edited with respect to the verification of the proposed hypotheses, the calculation and comparison <b>of</b> the respective <b>channel</b> efficiencies and additionally, the identification of patterns for gender and age groups. Research findings: The analysis of the collected data has shown that the three regarded criteria are of diverse importance and they are perceived differently for the channels physical retail stores and the Internet. Hence, the efficiency <b>of</b> those two <b>channels</b> is also unequal; physical retail stores reach a mean value of 46. 8 % and the Internet in turn achieves an average of 43. 1 %. This shows that both channels hold potential for improvement. When looking at patterns between gender and age groups, the authors could also identify interesting differentiations...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{draws on}} {{longitudinal}} survey data involving 824 employees {{from a small}} food processing organization operating in NSW (Australia). It explores the impact of job attitudes (including aspects of job satisfaction and commitment), communication and trust on preferences of three types of information sources : (1) “Grassroots/Consultative Channels” (i. e. colleague co-workers, unions and the consultative committee as helpful sources of information and feedback channels); (2) “Management Channels” (i. e. supervisors, mid-level and senior management as helpful sources of information and feedback channels) and (3) “Workplace-wide Channels” (i. e. the company newsletter and the notice board as helpful sources of information and feedback channels). The results show that there were common as well as specific predictors of choice/preference for each <b>of</b> the three <b>channels.</b> In particular, preferences for grassroots/consultative <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> information were most strongly influenced by trust/faith in colleagues and peers. In contrast, helpfulness <b>of</b> management <b>channels</b> was most strongly predicted by perceived effectiveness of communication with management {{as well as by}} the degree of faith/trust in senior managers. <b>Perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the existence of participation and teamwork in the workplace also seem to impact access to management as sources of information and feedback channels. Quite interestingly, preference for workplace-wide channels seems to be mainly affected by job satisfaction. It is worth noting that tenure also had a moderate impact on choice of grassroots/consultative as well as workplace-wide channels. In the case <b>of</b> management <b>channels,</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the effectiveness of communication with management were also a very significant factor in the ratings.

The problem investigated in this study was to ascertain administrators' opinions about using marketing function activities in Illinois public community colleges and to determine if their opinions concerning the need for marketing function activities differed when compared with current practice and future plans. A sub-set of the problem was to determine if administrators' opinions about marketing function activities differed by the position level of the administrator {{as well as by the}} demographics and finances of a college and its district. A review of the literature of marketing identified 11 marketing function activities which were used to develop the research instrument, a questionnaire. The questionnaire was field tested, validated and distributed to a total of 159 presidents, chief academic officers, and chief institutional advancement officers in all public community colleges in Illinois. Analysis of the data resulted in the following findings. Over 80 % of the administrators felt that there was a need for marketing function activities at their colleges. Over 50 % of the administrators felt that marketing function activities were being practiced, while over 75 % felt that planning for these marketing function activities had priority at their colleges. Significant differences were noted in the opinions of administrators when comparing the need for marketing function activities with current practice and future plans, respectively. When examining the difference in opinions between the three position levels of administrators, there was accord by presidents, chief academic officers and chief institutional advancement officers on the need for marketing function activities at their colleges. Although administrators at all three position levels were generally in agreement on the scope of current practice and the extent of future plans activities, there were exceptions for the marketing functions of personal selling-personal contact, new product development, and <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> distribution. Except for the marketing function activities of personal selling-personal contact, marketing information systems, pricing and <b>channels</b> <b>of</b> distribution, the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> administrators were not different on the need, scope of current practice and extent of future plans when colleges were considered on the basis of finances and demographics...|$|R

For these purposes the authors created a special technique, “Identifying Age through Photo Visualization” (Shkurko T. A., Nikolaeva E. G.). The study enrolled 20 individuals (10 men, 10 women aged 18 to 58 years) as “models” (i. e. objects <b>of</b> <b>perception)</b> and 60 individuals (47 women and 13 men aged 18 to 77 years) as subjects <b>of</b> <b>perception.</b> The paper shows that in the structure <b>of</b> <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> visual representations of age the most important are stable, moderately stable and dynamic components of appearance, among which the stable parameters prevail. The face as the focus of the stable, moderately stable and dynamic components of appearance is the key element of appearance in one’s <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> other people’s age...|$|R
