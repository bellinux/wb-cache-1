'How {{different from}} those <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>blocks</b> and walls along the Exmoor cliffs are these rich purple and olive ironstone layers, with their sharp serrated lines and polished slabs, set up on edge, snapped, bent double, twisted into serpentine curves, every sheet of cliff scored with sharp parallel lines at some fresh fantastic angle!' ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{still other}} {{memories}} hang about {{than those of}} primitive bishops and degenerate emperors. Byron lived here and Dante died here, and {{the tomb of the}} one poet and the dwelling of the other are among the advertised appeals. The grave of Dante, it must be said, is anything but Dantesque, and the whole precinct is disposed with that odd vulgarity of taste which distinguishes most modern Italian tributes to greatness. The author of The Divine Comedy commemorated in stucco, even in a slumbering corner of Ravenna, is not [...] "sympathetic." [...] Fortunately of all poets he least needs a monument, as he was pre-eminently an architect in diction and built himself his temple of fame in verses more solid than <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>blocks.</b> If Dante's tomb is not Dantesque, so neither is Byron's house Byronic, being a homely, shabby, two-storied dwelling, directly on the street, with as little as possible of isolation and mystery. In Byron's time it was an inn, and it is rather a curious reflection that [...] "Cain" [...] and the [...] "Vision of Judgment" [...] should have been written at an hotel. The fact supplies a commanding precedent for self-abstraction to tourists at once sentimental and literary. I must declare indeed that my acquaintance with Ravenna considerably increased my esteem for Byron and helped to renew my faith in the sincerity of his inspiration. A man so much de son temps as the author of the above-named and other pieces can have spent two long years in this stagnant city only by the help of taking a great deal of disinterested pleasure in his own genius. He had indeed a notable pastime--the various churches are adorned with monuments of ancestral Guicciolis--but it is none the less obvious that Ravenna, fifty years ago, would have been an intolerably dull residence to a foreigner of distinction unequipped with intellectual resources. The hour one spends with Byron's memory then is almost compassionate. After all, one says to one's self as one turns away from the grandiloquent little slab {{in front of his house}} and looks down the deadly provincial vista of the empty, sunny street, the author of so many superb stanzas asked less from the world than he gave it. One of his diversions was to ride in the Pineta, which, beginning a couple of miles from the city, extends some twenty-five miles along the sands of the Adriatic. I drove out to it for Byron's sake, and Dante's, and Boccaccio's, all of whom have interwoven it with their fictions, and for that of a possible whiff of coolness from the sea. Between the city and the forest, in the midst of malarious rice- swamps, stands the finest of the Ravennese churches, the stately temple of San Apollinare in Classe. The Emperor Augustus constructed hereabouts a harbour for fleets, which the ages have choked up, and which survives only in the title of this ancient church. Its extreme loneliness makes it doubly impressive. They opened the great doors for me, and let a shaft of heated air go wander up the beautiful nave between the twenty-four lustrous, pearly columns of cipollino marble, and mount the wide staircase of the choir and spend itself beneath the mosaics of the vault. I passed a memorable half-hour sitting in this wave of tempered light, looking down the cool grey avenue of the nave, out of the open door, at the vivid green swamps, and listening to the melancholy stillness. I rambled for an hour in the Wood of Associations, between the tall smooth, silvery stems of the pines, and beside a creek which led me to the outer edge of the wood and a view of white sails, gleaming and gliding behind the sand-hills. It was infinitely, it was nobly [...] "quaint," [...] but, as the trees stand at wide intervals and bear far aloft in the blue air but a little parasol of foliage, I suppose that, of a glaring summer day, the forest itself was only the more characteristic of its clime and country for being perfectly shadeless.|$|E

50|$|At a {{conventional}} date of 1350 BC, the fortifications on the acropolis, and other surrounding hills, were rebuilt {{in a style}} known as <b>cyclopean</b> because the <b>blocks</b> of stone used were so massive that they were thought in later ages to {{be the work of}} the one-eyed giants known as the Cyclopes (singular: Cyclops).

Cox wrote:One {{of the most}} interesting spots to visit, for obtaining a view of this character of scenery, is near the town of Shoals, {{on the road to the}} Indian Sulphur Springs. A high ridge of millstone grit, here, terminates within a few yards of the East Fork of White river, from the top of which, there is a projecting mass of conglomerate sandstone, called the [...] "Pinnacle," [...] which stands one hundred and seventy feet above the level of the stream. <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>blocks,</b> that have broken off, lie around the foot of the ridge, in every conceivable position. On the north side of this ridge, the conglomerate has been cut through by disintegrating forces, which left, at some distance from the main ledge, a tall mass of rock, which has received the name of [...] "Jug Rock," [...] from the fancied resemblance which it bears to a jug. It is forty-two feet high and supports, on its top, a flat projecting layer, which is called the [...] "stopper." [...] Just above the bulge of the jug are irregular lines of stratification, known as false bedding. The lower part is thickly set with quartz pebbles. The frontispiece to this volume presents a view of the [...] "Jug Rock" [...] which was copied from a photograph taken by D. Allbright. For this faithful representative of a highly interesting geological scene, I am indebted to B. F. Devol, and D. Allbright, of Shoals.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in {{the fourteenth}} century and lasting into the twelfth century B.C.E., this period saw even more {{creation}} of large-scale relief sculpture, and figures represented {{tend to be more}} solid, with thicker proportions. Much of the art found from the Hittite Empire Period comes from the settlement of Alaca Höyük. It is unclear which ancient city this correlates to, however {{it has been argued that}} it could be Tawiniya, Arinna, Hanhana, or Ziplanda. The most common opinion among scholars is that it is the holy city of Arinna, because of its proximity to the capital of Hattusa and the ritual practices depicted in art there. A much-studied monument in this area that is argued to have been constructed at this time is a stone gate flanked by two carved sphinxes and <b>cyclopean</b> <b>blocks</b> covered in unfinished reliefs of a religious procession and hunting scenes. This procession depicts Hittite royalty and six priests approaching a god in the form of a bull, and a cast of entertainers including acrobats and jesters on ladders. The hunting scenes are on blocks directly above this procession. However, there is disagreement among scholars as to the exact construction date of this structure. Some place it between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, while others argue that it belongs in the second half of the thirteenth century. The guardians wear the long Hathor curls common to Hittite sphinxes since at least the eighteenth century B.C.E. and were carved out of single blocks of stone 13ft high and 6.5ft thick. Another monument is the King's Gate leading into the temple district of in the upper city of Hattusa. Here a low relief of a god, 7ft tall, looms.Other reliefs of the Hittite exist on non-man-made structures. While some Hittite rock reliefs do not have inscriptions, and thus are difficult to date, others can be attributed to the reigns of specific kings such as Ḫattušili III, or Muwatalli II. Relief scenes from ancient Sam'al, in modern Zincirli Höyük, include a procession of gods on one wall and an image of a king named Tudḫaliya on the wall opposite it.The ceramic works produced at this time, apart from rare decorative pieces, was mainly plain with simple forms and a focus on utility and function. Hittites did make use of potters wheels, as well as the free sculpting of more animalistic forms. The forms and production methods were fairly consistent across the Empire. A piece from the village of Gordion, on the fringes of the Empire, could greatly resemble a piece from the capital, Hattusa.A small stone seal bearing Hittite hieroglyphics has been discovered in Megiddo, indicating trade outside the Empire. It also confirms the diplomatic ties with Egypt indicated by the Hittite-Egyptian Treaty, since Megiddo is an important stopping point for ambassadorial messengers between the two regions.|$|E
40|$|The {{clearing}} of {{the inner}} face of the West Cyclopean Wall revealed again the foundation existing below the retaining wall of the parapet of slabs of Grave Circle A (PI. 23). Its complete clearance proved {{that it is a}} segment of a circular wall that originally limited the area of the shaft graves. The investigation of its fill, under the supervision of Miss Olga Alexandri, yielded 22 small sherds dating the wall. Of these 4 were Gray Minyan, 11 Yellow Minyan, 7 mattpainted, one with a geometric decoration painted in dull white color. These sherds prove that the circular wall is contemporary with the earlier shaft graves of Circle A and place it to the second half and {{towards the end of the}} MH period. The clearance, by the late Dr. John Papadimitriou, of a cist grave under the slabs of the parapet some 1. 30 m. from the entrance of the Circle enabled him to point out that at places the foundation stones of the Ramp rest over a layer of chips formed when the slabs of the parapet were worked and to conclude that the Ramp was not contemporary with the rearrangement of the Circle as maintained by Wace. The further investigation of the area confirmed that observation (Figs. 68 and 69) and proved that the stones of that foundation in places overlap the base of the broken slabs (Figs. 71, 72, and 73). This proves definitely that the retaining wall of the Ramp was built sometime after the rearrangement of the Circle. The examination of the interstices of the block of that wall (Fig. 74) failed to yield sherds that would determine its date, but brought to light a drain which had remained undetected (Figs. 75, 76, and 77). Its opening was found closed with small stones and this seems to have occurred at the beginning of LH III C, as the latest sherds found in its fill indicate (Figs. 73, 78, and 79). The drain and its relation to the area immediately to the west of the Grave Circle — to the Little Ramp, the Ramp House, etc. — remain problematical and will be investigated at a later date. The effort to determine the date of the Great Ramp culminated in a trench some 5. 50 m. in length from north to south and 3. 45 m. in width from east to west. The present-day cobblestone pavement was considered as Stratum No. 1. Below it a layer of earth containing some small stones was found, Stratum 2, averaging 45 - 50 cm. in depth; it yielded 54 sherds, 4 of which were painted (Fig. 80, Nos. 6 - 14). Stratum 3 was composed of a fill of <b>Cyclopean</b> <b>blocks</b> in three superposed rows (Figs. 81, 82, and PI. 24, Γ) loosely piled. The earth between the stones yielded 42 sherds, 14 of which were painted (Fig. 84 Nos. 11 - 25). Incidentally, on this fill of stones were based the blocks which form the lateral wall of the Ramp (Fig. 83, ji - π). The conglomerate blocks ««», of the same figure, form but a single row and not another wall as was assumed heretofore, meant to retain the fill to the rocky formation beyond. Below the fill of stones, Stratum 4 was formed of a well - packed layer of earth 10 - 15 cm. in depth, evidently the surface of an earlier ramp that ascended from north to south (Fig. 81 and PL 74); this ramp had an average width of 2. 50 m., leaving a free passage to Grave Circle A of ca. 3. 50 m. 18 sherds were found in Stratum 4, of which 5 were painted (Fig. 84, Nos. 6 - 10). Stratum 5 consisted of another hard - surfaced layer, 5 - 17 cm. in depth, made up of hard reddish earth and pebbles (Fig. 81 and PI. 24). Bvidently it was another ramp which, however, ascended from south to north. It yielded 5 MH and 20 Mycenaean sherds, of which 9 were painted (Fig. 80, Nos. 15 - 23). Stratum 6 also contained a hard - surfaced ramp ascending from south to north laid over a packing of stones (Fig. 81 and PI. 24). All the sherds from this stratum belong to the MH period. The lowermost Stratum (No. 7) below the fill of stones of Stratum 6, extended to the rock, was made up of brownish earth, and contained MH sherds; its lowermost 10 cm. yielded also some BH plain sherds. It is. evident from the description of the layers that we have 4 different, superimposed ramps. Ramp No 1 is the existing cobble - covered Ramp that apparently was made towards the end of LH III B. Ramp 2 of Stratum 4 an earlier construction, belongs to the middle of LH III B and evidently was constructed when the Lion Gate was built. Ramp 3, in Stratum 5, with a different direction of ascent (from south to north), also belongs to LH III times, but it preceded the construction of the Lion Gate and led to the entrance of the first citadel (Fig. 85). Ramp 4, in Stratum 6, was the original ascent to the northwest slope and through it to the top of the hill used from MH to LH III A times. Ramp No i covered completely the area to the Grave Circle and thus blocked the passage to the houses and buildings to the west of that Circle. To make access possible the Little Ramp was then built, which thus is indicated to be contemporary with Ramp i, and should be placed towards the end of LH III B...|$|E
