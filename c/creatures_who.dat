5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} {{to make it more}} suitable as a family film. By the time it was completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two <b>creatures,</b> <b>who</b> should be natural enemies and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E
5|$|Following the cliffhanger of the {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith), his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), River Song, and Father Octavian (Iain Glen) and his militarised clerics have escaped entrapment by the Weeping Angels, <b>creatures</b> <b>who</b> only move when unobserved by others. They take refuge inside the crashed starship Byzantium, but the Angels pursue them and Amy is {{on the brink of}} dying from the imprint of an Angel in her eye. Both the Angels and the Doctor's team face danger from a widening crack in space and time which has the power to erase persons from history.|$|E
5|$|Some enemies move in {{predictable}} {{patterns and}} others hunt the player. They range in resemblance from larva and vultures to spiders. While ascending the mountain, the player passes through themed biomes, such as forest, desert, and snow, and each {{section of the}} mountain introduces new enemies that force the player to modify their strategy. TumbleSeed is depicted in a simple, colorful art style. Its characters are one-eyed, seed-shaped <b>creatures</b> <b>who</b> occasionally have hats. Their dialogue is visualized with speech bubbles, in text and emoji. Additionally, TumbleSeed includes other features including quests, leaderboards, and daily challenges.|$|E

5|$|The film {{focuses on}} an ogre named Shrek who finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale <b>creatures</b> <b>who</b> have been banished there {{by order of}} the evil Lord Farquaad. In order to get his swamp back, Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to bring him a queen in {{exchange}} for the deed for his swamp. Shrek sets out with a talking Donkey and rescues Princess Fiona. While they take Fiona to Farquaad so she can marry him, Shrek starts {{to fall in love with}} the princess and soon discovers a shocking secret about her.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{elephants}} in such fashion {{went beyond the}} common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as Thailand, where white elephants are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent {{the message that the}} ruler was able to preside over very powerful <b>creatures</b> <b>who</b> were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.|$|E
5|$|Written by David Fisher, {{this story}} was {{discussed}} with Script Editor Douglas Adams in late 1979, shortly before Adams left Doctor Who. It would have featured the Doctor battling the Nephilim, <b>creatures</b> <b>who</b> travel through time in sleeping units that look like sarcophagi. The name Nephilim was drawn from the Old Testament and from various Jewish writings, where it refers {{to a kind of}} demon. New producer Nathan-Turner was not interested and instead The Leisure Hive was developed as the season opener.|$|E

5|$|One day, the Magic Mirror {{informs the}} Queen that Snow White {{is now the}} fairest in the land. The jealous Queen orders her Huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, {{revealing}} the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee {{into the woods and}} never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland <b>creatures</b> <b>who</b> lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.|$|E
5|$|Sirenians first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Early Eocene and significantly diversified throughout the epoch. They inhabited rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters. Sirenians, unlike other marine mammals such as cetaceans, lived in the New World. The earliest aquatic sirenian discovered is Prorastomus which dates back to 40 million years ago, and the first known sirenian, the quadruped Pezosiren, lived 50 million years ago. Prorastomidae and Protosirenidae, the earliest sirenian families, consisted of pig-like amphibious <b>creatures</b> <b>who</b> died {{out at the end of}} the Eocene. When the Dugongidae appeared at this time, sirenians had evolved the characteristics of modern variety, including an aquatic streamlined body with flipper-like front legs with no hind limbs, and a powerful tail with horizontal caudal fins which uses an up-and-down motion to move them through the water.|$|E
5|$|The game's main enemy {{force is}} the Covenant, {{a group of}} alien species allied by belief in a common religion. Their forces include Elites, fierce warriors {{protected}} by recharging energy shields much like the player's own; Grunts, which are short, comically cowardly <b>creatures</b> <b>who</b> are usually led by Elites in battle, and often flee in terror instead of fighting {{in the absence of}} a leading Elite; Jackals, originally space pirates, they wear a highly durable energy shield on one arm and a form of handgun on the other; and Hunters, large, powerful creatures composed of small worm-like colonies with thick armor plates that cover the majority of their bodies and a large assault cannon that fires explosive rounds of green plasma.|$|E

5|$|A world {{containing}} <b>creatures</b> <b>who</b> {{are significantly}} free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of generations, the cheela come to worship the humans' {{spacecraft}} as a god, and their records of its satellites' movements cause them to develop writing. Several generations later, the cheela build an arena to accommodate thousands of worshippers. The humans notice this novel and very regular feature, conclude that intelligent beings inhabit the star, and use a laser to send simple messages. Cheela astronomers gradually realize that these are diagrams of the spaceships, its satellites and its crew – impossibly spindly <b>creatures,</b> <b>who</b> communicate with frustrating slowness, and are apparently almost 10% {{as long as the}} cheela's great arena. A cheela engineer proposes to send messages to the humans. As her attempts to transmit from the civilization's territory are ineffective, she travels to a mountain range to transmit directly under the spacecraft – conquering the fear of heights that is instinctive for flattened creatures living in 67billion g. The humans recognize her message and realize that the cheela live a million times faster than humans.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} three {{land on the}} strange planet, Ransom gets his chance to run off into the unknown landscape, just after he sees the Sorns—tall alien <b>creatures</b> <b>who</b> terrify him. Ransom wanders around, finding many {{differences}} between Earth and Malacandra, in that all the lakes, streams, and rivers are warm; the gravity is significantly less; and the plants and mountains are strangely tall and thin.|$|E
25|$|Shiva sensed this catastrophe, and {{his rage}} was incomparable. He created Virabhadra and Bhadrakali, two ferocious <b>creatures</b> <b>who</b> wreaked havoc and mayhem {{on the scene}} of the horrific incident. Two temples on the island of Nainativu {{propagate}} the worship of these energies - namely Nainai Virabhadra Temple and Nainai Kali Amman Temple. Nearly all those present were indiscriminately felled overnight. Dakshin himself was decapitated.|$|E
