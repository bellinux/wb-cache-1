Thomaston Mills was a major employer in the county from its beginning in 1899 until 2001, before the company moved to Mexico. Martha Mills, a manufacturer of tire <b>cord</b> <b>fabric,</b> began operation in 1927 and ceased operations in 2006 (Martha Mills was bought by B. F. Goodrich in 1929, and later WesTek in 2008). In the 1920s the peach industry thrived in Upson County, but peaches all but vanished in the county with the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, as orchard laborers found work in the mills. Peach orchards were cut down to make room for timber stands.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} three-point flexure tests on hybrid I- and Π-beams, {{made out of}} {{multi-layer}} carbon fiber/epoxy resin (including twill woven fabric CF 3031 / 5284 and unidirectional <b>cord</b> <b>fabric</b> U 3160 / 5284) reinforced composites, processed using the RTM (resin transfer molding) technique. Static bending properties were determined and failure initiation mechanism was deduced from experimental observations. Failure mode of the tested hybrid RTM-made I-beams can be reckoned to be characteristic of the delamination from the cutout edge within the web and the debonding propagation along the interface between the inverted triangular resin-rich zone and the adjacent curved web until local buckling within the curved webs around the conjunction fillet region. In contrast, as distinct from hybrid RTM I-beams subjected to three-point bending loading, hybrid RTM-made Π-beams in three-point flexure tests experienced the resin debonding in the inverted triangular resin-rich zones and the debonding propagation along the interface between the inverted triangular resin-rich zone and the adjacent curved web until complete separation of the curved web from the flange. Progressive damage models (PDMs) were presented to predict failure loads and process of hybrid RTM-made I- and Π-beams under three-point flexure. Good correlation was achieved between experimental and numerical results...|$|E

50|$|Russell cord is {{a finely}} <b>corded</b> <b>fabric,</b> {{generally}} constructed with a cotton warp and worsted weft (filling). Two or more warp threads are woven {{together to form}} the cord, thus the cord lines run warp-wise. Russell cord is visually similar to a very narrow-waled corduroy called pincord, but it is heavier and more sturdy. It is usually woven using 40% cotton and 60% wool (or similar compositions depending on the weaver). It is mainly used {{in the making of}} quality black academical dress, as well as clerical dress and legal dress in the United Kingdom. It is woven using thicker strands so is heavier than princetta.|$|R
5000|$|Grosgrain , also gros-grain and, rarely, gros grain, {{is a type}} {{of fabric}} {{characterized}} by its ribbed appearance. In grosgrain, the weft is heavier than the warp, creating prominent transverse ribs. It is called a [...] "corded" [...] fabric since the weft resembles a fine cord. Grosgrain is a plain weave <b>corded</b> <b>fabric,</b> with heavier <b>cords</b> than in poplin but lighter than in faille. Grosgrain has a very dull appearance with little luster but is very strong. It is a firm, close-woven, fine-corded fabric. While grosgrain fabric is generally black, it can be many different colors, and grosgrain ribbon comes in a large variety of colors and patterns.|$|R

5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material. By 1847, crinoline fabric was {{being used as a}} stiffening for skirt linings, although English women preferred separate crinoline fabric petticoats which were beginning to collapse under the increasing weight of the skirts. One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and <b>corded</b> cotton <b>fabric</b> for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile. The artificial crinoline with hoops did not emerge until the 1850s.|$|R

40|$|Includes {{digitized}} {{images in}} JPEG and TIFF formats. Simple curiosity had attracted me to {{a demonstration of}} computer-assisted graphics and I found the idea immensely exciting. As an experienced painter with {{a strong interest in}} color and design, the challenge of programming imagery on my own terms was irresistible. Art, science, technology, formalism, philosophy, subjective thoughts, feelings, the sacred and profane are all incorporated into a loop of ideas, tools and expression. This is not a simple linear process, but a complex one of multiple interacting synaptic connections triggering impulses and responses. These occur within the human brain and with a probable " 100 trillion synapses in every brain" (Rubel, 1979), the uniqueness of each individual becomes apparent. With new tools, a way opens up to new knowledge, new ideas and new opportunities to re-examine the world and re-interpret it in another way. FROM ZERO TO ONE is an art exhibit using the computer as a tool. These drawings/ paintings/graphics are called "plots" in computer terminology and are a culmination of over two years experimentation. The electronic machinery involved is the CDC 3170, a very large computer on the Northridge campus, and the Calcomp plotter 936 which does the actual drawing with ballpoint pens or liquid ink. Limitations of computer time, type of paper and choice of colors are constant realities that effectively teach patience, humility and resourcefulness. Strategies in programming to outwit a time factor and to overcome the difficulties of using only three standardized colors must be devised. Interesting problems in visual perception also occurred. These had evolved out of the peculiarities of the plotter itself which can only draw straight lines. Eventually, I discovered moire patterns as a useful means of expression. Moires are created by overlapping two sets of parallel lines or circles. The kind of design obtained is dependent on the angle of the displacement. Moires are found naturally in the surface reflections in pools of water, in overlapping screens or bamboo blinds, in folds of loosely woven cloth. They are deliberately manufactured into "moire silks" by pressing together slightly misaligned parallel <b>cords</b> of a <b>fabric</b> with a pronounced weave (Oster and Nishijima, 1963). Engineers view moires as interference patterns and use them to analyze strain. Moires are part of every plot in the exhibit. They have been manipulated and bent to conform to the idea of each individual plot contrary to the aim of the engineer. However, inasmuch as a moire is an optical visualization of stress, it enhances the idea of moire as a metaphor. (See more in text...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{development}} of draping and pleating methods of heavy fabric referring indirectly to the stage Curtain, {{the aim of the}} project is to study ambiguous coexistence of masking and exposing made by repetitive folds, simultaneously developing technique studies and site analysis and apply them to make a new concert hall for Stockholm. The thesis defines the concert hall a public space, and further develops the concert hall as a public space by exposing the commonly inaccessible backstage area in on the ground floor Visitors and concert-goers have the opportunity to look behind the scenes and reconsider the value of art by seeing how a piece of music has been shaped and rehearsed. There are some performance halls throughout Europe that open their backstage doors to the public in order to see what is going on behind the stage. Ways of disclosing the backstage has been achieved through design technique studies and by considering the history of folded fabric in a design research. The main part of the research is based on the theoretical influence that Semper specified in his book Style, the topic of textiles and their relationship in architecture and it has been completed by developing a terminology and meanings defined by contemporary artist Petra Blaisse in her book Inside outside. Throughout history, many artists have spent time on the study of fabric and folds; an example is the dramatic drapery in Baroque sculptures such as the “Bernini folds,” making a hard material appears soft. I tried to take advantage of all the qualities that heavy fabric can offer for {{the development}} of my building and use most of the information that can be derived from fabrics application. An example of applying these qualities is making deep semi masked openings. Making apertures through deep folds to rehearsal rooms, the folds open and close visually as people pass by. By continuing this method and using the qualities of deep surfaces from outside to inside I tried to achieve a backstage that is both open and masked in the same time. The project has been started by focusing on two parallel tracks of site and technique study. The site is located on the Djurgården. Djurgården is home to historical buildings and monuments, museums, galleries. Galärparken is located between three museums that are known for their historical heritage. This site requires very careful design in relation to buildings surrounding it. However; the site provides a good context for a distinctive building that creates identity and contributes to a good overall situation. Parallel to the site analyzes the design technique studies have been developed. The proposal has been developed through analyzing two parallel tracks of pleating and draping. Within the pleating method linear techniques have been investigated to make repetitive folds to define surfaces, and extruding techniques have been investigated to create volumetric depth. Draping methods are: fluttering, masking, fullness and tassel. After defining and refining each of the techniques, they have been applied at a building scale to articulate the material organization of the concert hall. Tassel: Tying fabric from one end and hang it. framing space while having fabric freely. A tuft of loosely hanging <b>fabric,</b> <b>cords,</b> or other material knotted at one end ” [...] . another of white cashmere, draped in heavy folds, hanging in half moons and caught at every interval with splendid white silk tassels, each draping being trimmed with a narrow silk fringe” Gottfried Semper, StyleFluttering: To make small, gentle movements in the air, to move something in a particular direction by pulling it gently e. g. “A wind machine blew air in to the drape and made it flutter” Inside outside, Petra BlaisseMasking: To cover or hide something so it cannot be clearly seen. A set of curtains or scenic elements used to define the visual limits of a performance area. ” Glossary of Theatre termsFullness: The condition of being full with chunky pleats. Fullness is a common term used to describe an aspect of stage curtains; it is directly attributable to the amount of pleating present. For instance, a curtain that has no pleating at all (a flat sheet) has 0 % fullness; a curtain that has 100 % fullness will start out as fabric that is twice as wide as required. ”Glossary of Theatre terms. The project’s program is to make a 1500 -seat auditorium. The project is made of two different layers. The first layer shapes the outer envelope and the other layer is happening inside enveloping the auditorium. These two layers are connected by different shaped slabs at different levels. The auditorium drapes loosely between the slabs at different levels. The circulation between floors take places all around the auditorium. Each level has a view to the other floors so the flow of people can be seen from different levels. The first floor is accessible for all people and provides an open plan while exposing backstage and makes transition between Nordiska museum and the waterfront. The fullness quality has been introduced in three parts of the exterior envelope in relation to the site. The first is the part that faces the Nordic museum including one of the entrances between the folds. The next part is the part that faces to Stockholm and again openings are embedded between the folds. The last pleated part is located within the side that faces Vasa museum. The Vasa museum is here in close proximity with the concert hall. In respect to the Vasa museum the concert hall has been pushed in, and deep surfaces can be seen here as well. The inner layer has been shaped also by deep surfaces made by deep folds. At ground floor, where the back stage is located, the deep folds can make semi open apertures and provide a view to rehearsal rooms for visitors. From the other side the semi masked openings of the backstage faces a cafeteria with seats with a view to the training rooms. On the other floors, folds create openings to the auditorium from different sides. The concert hall has been shaped with respect to site and adjacent buildings. The implementation and coexistence of masking and revealing strategies have been developed through design techniques studies and subsequently influenced the design...|$|R
