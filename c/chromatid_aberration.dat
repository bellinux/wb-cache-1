40|$|The {{in vitro}} 02 {{chromosomal}} radiosensitivity assay {{is a technique}} used to investigate variation in the cellular response to radiation. In brief, lymphocytes are irradiated in the 02 phase of the cell cycle to induce DNA damage, which is exhibited at the subsequent metaphase as chromatid gaps and breaks. Radiation-induced arrest {{at the end of}} (32 is believed to allow time for adequate DNA repair before the onset of mitosis. Therefore, variation in the level of aberrations observed at metaphase is likely to be driven in part by 02 checkpoint control. This led to an investigation into whether variation in in vitro G 2 chromosomal radiosensitivity is related to 02 checkpoint efficacy. A modified version of the 02 chromosomal radiosensitivity assay was validated with samples from staff at Westlakes Research Institute. The standard 02 assay protocol was altered by the addition of the chemical calyculin A which induces Premature Chromosome Condensation (PCC) in interphase cells enabling visualisation and classification of all cell cycle stages (G 1, S, G 2 and metaphase). Initial attempts at assessing G 2 to metaphase transition by visualising and scoring damage directly in G 2 cells failed. However, by measuring changes in the ratio of PCC-G 2 and metaphase cells before and after irradiation, it was possible to measure 02 checkpoint delay. Following validation of the PCC technique, both the G 2 assay and the modified assay were applied to a group of 29 cancer survivors and the extent of any individual G 2 checkpoint delay was compared to the radiation-induced <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberration</b> frequency. No significant relationship between <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberration</b> frequency and G 2 checkpoint delay was observed. Providing that the PCC technique is accurately assessing G 2 delay, Ill the results suggest that variation in G 2 chromosomal radiosensitivity {{is more likely to be}} driven by variation in DNA repair pathways than variation in G 2 checkpoint delay...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: DNA-associated Auger-electron {{emitters}} (AEE) cause cellular damage {{leading to}} high-LET type cell survival curves indicating an enhanced relative biological effectiveness. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by Iodine- 125 -deoxyuridine (I- 125 -UdR) decays are {{claimed to be}} very complex. To elucidate the assumed genotoxic potential of DNA-associated AEE, chromosome aberrations were analyzed in I- 125 -UdR-exposed human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Methods: PBL were isolated from whole blood and stimulated with chromosome medium containing phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). After 24 h cultures were labelled with I- 125 -UdR for 18 h (activity concentration 1 – 45 kBq) during the S-phase. Following standard cytogenetic procedure, at least 100 metaphases were analyzed microscopically for each activity concentration. Cell death was measured by apoptosis assay using flow cytometry. Radiation doses were determined by using point kernel calculations. Results: After 18 h labeling with I- 125 -UdR the cell cycle distribution is severely disturbed. About 40 % of PBL are fully labeled and 20 % show a moderate labeling of I- 125 -UdR, whereas 40 % of cells remain unlabeled. I- 125 -UdR primarily induces chromatid-type aberrations. The dose-response relationship fits well to a polynomial curve in the low dose range, whereas a linear fit supplies a better estimation in the high dose range. Even the lowest dose of 0. 2 Gy leads to significant damage and to a 13 -fold increase of aberrations compared to the controls. On average every fifth I- 125 -decay produces a single <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberration</b> in PBL. In addition, a dose-dependent increase of cell death is observed. Conclusions: I- 125 -UdR {{has a very strong}} genotoxic capacity in human PBL even at very low cellular doses of about 0. 2 Gy. Efficiently labeled cells displaying a prolonged cell cycle compared to moderately labeled cells and cell death contribute substantially to the desynchronisation of the cell cycle. Our data, showing that one I- 125 -decay induces  0. 2 chromatid aberrations, are in very good accordance to the data of Sedelnikova [1] and Yasui [2] who found  0. 26 DSB per decay, indicating that approximately every DSB is converted into a <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberration.</b> [1] O.

40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that cells appear to become less {{susceptible}} to the induction of radiation damage, and in particular of chromosome and <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> in shea-term cultures of human lymphocytes, when a challenge exposure to ionizing radiation is preceded by a low 'adaptive' dose. Contradictory results have been reported on {{the conditions under which}} the phenomenon can be evidenced. In the present work, circulating lymphocytes of 13 children contaminated from the fallout after the Chernobyl accident were tested for their capability to exhibit an adaptive response in experiments in which the challenge dose was administered to stimulated lymphocytes in the S-G(2) phase. Furthermore, the possible influence of 3 -aminobenzamide, an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, was also investigated. Our results indicate that, at least in the instance of the end-point here used (chromosome and <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations,</b> the former resulting possibly from the Cs burden), human lymphocytes, chronically exposed to low doses from fallout, do not exhibit any decreased susceptibility to ionizing radiation.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{chromosome}} aberrations induced by 1 -Beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara C) and Adriamycin (AM) in the chromosomes of cultured human lymphocytes was made. There were {{significant increases in}} the frequency of aberrations with increasing concentrations of both Ara C (2. 5, 5. 0 and 10. 0 mug/ml) and AM (0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 10 and 0. 15 mug/ml). The frequency of aberrations induced by both drugs also showed a 'levelling off' above particular concentrations. For Ara C the effect of increasing treatment time was also studied. The frequency of aberrations increased significantly with increasing treatment times (2, 3 and 4 hrs) although no 'levelling off' in the number of aberrations was observed. The relationship between the frequency of the different types of aberrations induced by Ara C and AM was studied. AM allowed for a study of the relative frequency of chromosome versus <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> and fragment versus exchange aberrations. There were always more fragments than exchanges, and always more <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> than chromosome aberrations. Aberrations induced by Ara C were all of the chromatid fragment type. A study was made of the distribution of inter- and intra-chromosomal aberrations in relation to light and dark G banded chromosomes. Both drugs induced more aberrations in the light G bands than the dark G bands. Both drugs showed distinct clustering of aberrations in some regions of the chromosomes (hotspots), although the location of AM induced hotspots was different from the location of those induced by Ara C. The distribution of AM induced <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> was different from the distribution of the chromosome aberrations, as were the distributions of the fragment and exchange aberrations. The different types of aberrations also differed in the number of AM induced aberrations per unit length between the p and q arms. There were more aberrations per unit length in the p arm than in the q arm for exchanges, whereas for fragments and chromosome aberrations the reverse was true. For <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations,</b> {{there was no significant difference}} in the number of aberrations per unit length between the p and q arms. Inter-individual differences {{in the frequency of}} AM induced aberrations were observed in the. AM dosage experiments. Also there was a suggestion that the distribution of Ara C induced aberrations was different for different donors. AM increased the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges. Comparable results were not sought for Ara C because after cells were exposed to Ara C they did not pass through an S phase of the cell cycle, as is the case for cells exposed to AM. The relevance of the present in vitro studies to cancer chemotherapy is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{observation}} {{was made}} previously that {{the reduction in}} radiosensitivity in Vicia faba (as measured by postirradiation root growth) by prolonging the exposure time from about 10 minutes to 24 hours is much less marked at 3 °C. than at 19 °C. If chromosome damage is mainly responsible for the reduced root growth, this observation might be explained by a smaller drop in the "two-hit" aberration component, resulting from an increased time for which breaks are available for rejoining at 3 °C. This hypothesis was tested by comparing <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberration</b> frequencies in root meristem cells produced by 105 rads of 60 Co γ rays, given at dose rates of 19. 4 and 0. 073 rads per minute. Beans were maintained in aerated water at 2 °C. prior to and during irradiation, and at this temperature the rate of development of cells was such that the two different exposure times both occupied a period during which the cell sensitivity was approximately constant. Immediately subsequent to irradiation, the roots were returned to 19 °C. and examined cytologically. All chromatid aberrations were less frequent after low dose rate treatment, but only the chromatid interchange reduction was significant.

40|$|Part 1 : The {{level of}} {{cytogenetic}} damage induced by ionizing radiation under in vitro conditions in human peripheral blood lymphocytes is analyzed {{for the purpose}} of biological dosimetry and for assessing the intrinsic radiosensitivity of the blood donors. A factor that is often not regarded, but may influence the level of DNA damage is blood temperature during exposure. Hence, this part of the thesis was conducted to analyse the impact of temperature during irradiation of lymphocytes at 0 °C and 37 °C on the level of DNA damage using micronucleus assay and comet assay. Whole blood cultures were kept at 0 °C and 37 °C for 15 min before and during exposure to 2 Gy of X-rays. In some experiments isolated PBL were additionally incubated in the presence of 0. 5 M DMSO (radical scavenger). A significantly higher level of micronuclei was found when lymphocytes were kept 15 min before and during exposure at 37 °C when compared to 0 °C. This effect disappeared in the presence of DMSO, what indicates that the observed temperature effect in micronucleus assay is due to the indirect action of radiation. No temperature effect was observed using alkaline and neutral versions of comet assay. Part 2 : There is some evidence that approximately 10 % of the population show an enhanced intrinsic radiosensitivity of normal tissue and hence have a higher risk for developing side-effects during or after radiotherapy. Moreover, higher cellular radiosensitivity may also indicate cancer susceptibility. For that reason {{there is a need for}} a fast and robust test to assess individual cellular radiosensitivity. Hence, the aim of the second part of the thesis was to find out whether PBL from prostate cancer patients (PC) with strong clinical side effects following radiotherapy show enhanced rates of in vitro radiation-induced DNA damage when compared to patients without side effects and healthy age–matched donors. The study included 20 prostate cancer patients without and 20 patients with acute side-effects during and after radiotherapy, as well as 20 healthy age-matched donors. From each donor, blood samples were collected, exposed to a radiation dose of 0. 5 Gy or 1 Gy of γ–rays and analysed for the following biological endpoints: the initial level of dsb and the repair kinetics (γ–H 2 AX–assay), apoptosis (Annexin V/PI–assay) and the induction of chromatid–type chromosomal aberrations (G 2 –assay). Significant higher <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberration</b> yield was found in prostate cancer patients when compared to healthy donors. No differences were observed between both patients groups in any in vitro assay. Clinical radiosensitivity in vivo assessed on the basis of the EPIC questionnaire correlated with cellular radiosensitivity in vitro assessed on the basis of <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberration</b> 90 th cut-off value analysis for 50 - 62 % of prostate cancer patients.

40|$|A {{detailed}} cytogenetic {{study of}} maturing mouse oocyte radiosensitivity was performed. Oocytes were collected at various intervals ranging from 1. 5 days to 28. 5 days after irradiation with 50, 100, 200, and 300 R of acute X-rays. The observed sensitivity to <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberration</b> induction varied greatly over this time span. Sensitivity was lowest at the shortest time interval before ovulation and gradually increased up to 9. 5 days; it then remained constant until insufficient numbers of oocytes could be collected. The {{data were analyzed}} in three ways. First, the data from all time intervals at each dose were pooled; second {{the data from the}} least sensitive time intervals, at each dose, were pooled, and third, the data from the period of uniform sensitivity, at each dose, were pooled. Dose-response regression analyses were done on these pooled data and the best fits obtained were to the models Y = a + bD + cD 2 and Y = a + cD 2 for both deletions and interchanges. This result is interpreted as indicating that the aberrations result from a predominantly two-track process. The cytogenetic data were compared to specific-locus mutation induction data in comparable oocyte stages, and qualitative similarity in doseresponse characteristics were observed. This similarity is interpreted to mean that both events result from the same mechanism, and that the large dose-rate effect, observed for both events, {{is a reflection of the}} two-track component in the dose-response curves...|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{are growing}} evidences for {{chromosomal}} radioadaptive response in human lymphocytes. Highly variable inter- and intra-individual responses have been reported. Some individuals are non-responders {{and even in}} some donors the frequency of <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> induced by a challenge dose increases by pre-exposure to an adapting dose. It has been proposed {{that the lack of}} radioadaptive response is due to transient physiological factors. Materials and Methods: We found a young healthy donor who exhibited no radioadaptive response in our initial experiments. After a common adapting dose, the donor occasionally showed a highly increased susceptibility to subsequent high-dose irradiation. To assess whether the lack of radioadaptive response and the induction of a synergistic effect are transient responses, we have performed a 3 -year follow-up study employing micronuclei in binucleated cells besides <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> as biological endpoints. To eliminate the effect of the cell cycle on intrinsic radiosensitivity of a cell, we used the multiple-fixation regimen for analysis of chromosomal aberrations. Results: This donor showed no adaptive response in any experiment. Conclusion: Considering the consistent non-responsiveness observed throughout our serial experiments, it may be concluded that the lack of radioadaptive response is not attributed to some transient physiological factors but rather to permanent constitutional traits.

40|$|BCCIP is a BRCA 2 - and CDKN 1 A(p 21) -interacting {{protein that}} has been implicated in the {{maintenance}} of genomic integrity. To understand the in vivo functions of BCCIP, we generated a conditional BCCIP knockdown transgenic mouse model using Cre-LoxP mediated RNA interference. The BCCIP knockdown embryos displayed impaired cellular proliferation and apoptosis at day E 7. 5. Consistent with these results, the in vitro proliferation of blastocysts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) of BCCIP knockdown mice were impaired considerably. The BCCIP deficient mouse embryos die before E 11. 5 day. Deletion of the p 53 gene could not rescue the embryonic lethality due to BCCIP deficiency, but partially rescues the growth delay of mouse embryonic fibroblasts in vitro. To further understand the cause of development and proliferation defects in BCCIP-deficient mice, MEFs were subjected to chromosome stability analysis. The BCCIP-deficient MEFs displayed significant spontaneous chromosome structural alterations associated with replication stress, including a 3. 5 -fold induction of chromatid breaks. Remarkably, the BCCIP-deficient MEFs had a ∼ 20 -fold increase in sister chromatid union (SCU), yet the induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) was modestly at 1. 5 fold. SCU is a unique type of <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberration</b> that may give rise to chromatin bridges between daughter nuclei in anaphase. In addition, the BCCIP-deficient MEFs have reduced repair of irradiation-induced DNA damage and reductions of Rad 51 protein and nuclear foci. Our data suggest a unique function of BCCIP, not only in repair of DNA damage, but also in resolving stalled replication forks and prevention of replication stress. In addition, BCCIP deficiency causes excessive spontaneous chromatin bridges via the formation of SCU, which can subsequently impair chromosome segregations in mitosis and cell division...|$|E

40|$|Fanconi Anemia (FA) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} recessive disorder characterized by hypersensitivity to inter-strand crosslinks (ICLs). FANCD 2, a central factor of the FA pathway, {{is essential for the}} repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) generated during fork collapse at ICLs. While lesions different from ICLs can also trigger fork collapse, the contribution of FANCD 2 to the resolution of replication-coupled DSBs generated independently from ICLs is unknown. Intriguingly, FANCD 2 is readily activated after UV irradiation, a DNA-damaging agent that generates predominantly intra-strand crosslinks but not ICLs. Hence, UV irradiation is an ideal tool to explore the contribution of FANCD 2 to the DNA damage response triggered by DNA lesions other than ICL repair. Here we show that, in contrast to ICL-causing agents, UV radiation compromises cell survival independently from FANCD 2. In agreement, FANCD 2 depletion does not increase the amount of DSBs generated during the replication of UV-damaged DNA and is dispensable for UV-induced checkpoint activation. Remarkably however, FANCD 2 protects UV-dependent, replication-coupled DSBs from aberrant processing by non-homologous end joining, preventing the accumulation of micronuclei and <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> including non-homologous <b>chromatid</b> exchanges. Hence, while dispensable for cell survival, FANCD 2 selectively safeguards chromosomal stability after UV-triggered replication stress...|$|R
40|$|Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is an {{inherited}} disorder characterized by reticular pigmentation of the skin, dystrophic nails, mucosal leukoplakia, and a predisposition to cancer in early adult life. In {{the majority of}} cases, DC is an X-linked recessive trait. However, one or more autosomal form(s) of DC may exist. Although excessive spontaneous chromatid breakage {{has been reported in}} DC, it is not a consistent cytological marker for this disorder. We examined the frequency and specificity of X-irradiation-induced G 2 chromatid breakage in fibroblasts from three unrelated DC patients (two males and one female). Metaphase cells from DC patients had significantly more chromatid breaks (16 - 18 -fold and 17 - 26 -fold at 50 and 100 rad X-irradiation, respectively) and chromatid gaps (10 - 12 -fold and 6 - 7 -fold at 50 and 100 rad, respectively) than those from two different controls. Analysis of banded chromosomes revealed a nonrandom distribution of <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> in DC but not in controls, a distribution corresponding to some of the known breakpoints for cancer-specific rearrangements, constitutive fragile sites, and/or loci for cellular proto-oncogenes. The significance of this finding for cancer predisposition in DC patients is uncertain, but the increased susceptibility of X-irradiation-induced chromatid breakage may serve as a cellular marker of diagnostic value...|$|R
40|$|The {{cytogenetic}} {{effects of}} triethylenemelamine (TEM) were studied using five different mammalian tissues. Treatments of 0. 1 and 0. 2 mg/kg TEM on differentiating mouse spermatogonia and bone marrow cells {{showed no significant}} differences in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations produced in these two tissues. At higher doses, however, the sensitivities of the two tissues appear to be different. The frequency of aberrations varies with time after treatment, with the greatest amount occurring at the later fixation times. Results of an experiment on primary spermatocytes indicated a correlation between the frequency of chromosome aberrations and DNA replication. Human peripheral leukocytes were utilized in an attempt to clarify the cellstage specificity of TEM-induced chromosome aberrations. Cultures were treated with TEM prior to PHA stimulation (G 0), as well as various time intervals after stimulation (late G, 1 S, and G 2). The most sensitive stages of the cell cycle to aberration induction were later G 1 and S, with <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> the predominant type. A very low yield of chromosome damage was observed with the G 0 and G 1 treated stages. The experiments described tend to support the view that TEM is most effective at inducing aberrations when an intervening round of DNA replication has occurred...|$|R
40|$|Several {{types of}} DNA lesion are induced after {{ionizing}} irradiation (IR) of which double strand breaks (DSBs) {{are expected to}} be the most lethal, although single strand breaks (SSBs) and DNA base damages are quantitatively in the majority. Proteins of the base excision repair (BER) pathway repair these numerous lesions. DNA polymerase beta has been identified as a crucial enzyme in BER and SSB repair (SSBR). We showed previously that inhibition of BER/SSBR by expressing a dominant negative DNA polymerase beta (polbetaDN) resulted in radiosensitization. We hypothesized increased kill to result from DSBs arising from unrepaired SSBs and BER intermediates. We find here higher numbers of IR-induced chromosome aberrations in polbetaDN expressing cells, confirming increased DSB formation. These aberrations did not result from changes in DSB induction or repair of the majority of lesions. SSB conversion to DSBs has been shown to occur during replication. We observed an increased induction of <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> in polbetaDN expressing cells after IR, suggesting such a replication-dependence of secondary DSB formation. We also observed a pronounced increase of chromosomal deletions, the most likely cause of the increased kill. After H(2) O(2) treatment, polbetaDN expression only resulted in increased <b>chromatid</b> (not chromosome) <b>aberrations.</b> Together with the lack of sensitization to H(2) O(2), these data further suggest that the additional secondarily induced lethal DSBs resulted from repair attempts at complex clustered damage sites, unique to IR. Surprisingly, the polbetaDN induced increase in residual gammaH 2 AX foci number was unexpectedly low compared with the radiosensitization or induction of aberrations. Our data thus demonstrate the formation of secondary DSBs that are reflected by increased kill but not by residual gammaH 2 AX foci, indicating an escape from gammaH 2 AX-mediated DSB repair. In addition, we show that in the polbetaDN expressing cells secondary DSBs arise in a radiation-specific and partly replication-dependent manner...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the potential contribu-tion of irradiated medium to the bystander effect using cus-tom-made double-Mylar stainless steel rings. Exponentially growing human–hamster hybrid (AL) cells were plated on ei-ther one or both sides of double-Mylar dishes 2 – 4 days before irradiation. One side (with or without cells) was irradiated with a particles using the track segment mode of a 4 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator at the Radiological Research Ac-celerator Facility of Columbia University. Since a particles can traverse only a very limited distance (around 23 mm in water), cells plated {{on the other side}} of a medium-filled Mylar dish will not be irradiated by the a particles. The results of the cytogenetic assay of unirradiated target cells that were attached to the top Mylar layer indicate that the number of chromatid-type aberrations was higher when there was a bot-tom layer of cells in the medium-filled chambers than with just medium alone. Furthermore, when the medium was transferred from these cell-irradiated dishes to fresh AL cell cultures, chromatid-type aberrations were produced in the unirradiated fresh cells. In contrast, medium irradiated in the absence of cells had no effect on <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations.</b> These results suggest that certain unidentified modulating factors se-creted from the irradiated cells on the bottom Mylar layer into the medium induce chromatin damage in the unirradi-ated bystander cells. q 2004 by Radiation Research Societ...|$|R
40|$|Unique among translesion {{synthesis}} (TLS) DNA polymerases, pol ζ {{is essential}} during embryogenesis. To determine whether pol ζ {{is necessary for}} proliferation of normal cells, primary mouse fibroblasts were established in which Rev 3 L could be conditionally inactivated by Cre recombinase. Cells were grown in 2 % O 2 to prevent oxidative stress-induced senescence. Cells rapidly became senescent or apoptotic and ceased growth within 3 – 4 population doublings. Within one population doubling following Rev 3 L deletion, DNA double-strand breaks and <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> were found in 30 – 50 % of cells. These breaks were replication dependent, and found in G 1 and G 2 phase cells. Double-strand breaks were reduced when cells were treated with the reactive oxygen species scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine, but this did not rescue the cell proliferation defect, indicating that several classes of endogenously formed DNA lesions require Rev 3 L for tolerance or repair. T-antigen immortalization of cells allowed cell growth. In summary, {{even in the absence}} of external challenges to DNA, pol ζ is essential for preventing replication-dependent DNA breaks in every division of normal mammalian cells. Loss of pol ζ in slowly proliferating mouse cells in vivo may allow accumulation of chromosomal aberrations that could lead to tumorigenesis. Pol ζ is unique amongst TLS polymerases for its essential role in cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|To whom reprint {{requests}} {{should be sent}} Chronic exposure to 1, 3 -butadiene (BD) results in a marked increase {{in the incidence of}} thymk lymphoma in male B 6 C 3 F 1 relative to NIH Swiss mice whereas no demonstrable dif-ferences in bone marrow (target organ) toxkity exist. Repeated exposure to BD is known to produce a macrocytk anemia and an increase in the frequency of mkronuclei in circulating erythrocytes in both strains. The present study was undertaken to determine if chromosomal breakage, aneu-ploidy or both reflect differences in BD leukemogenicity observed between B 6 C 3 F 1 and NIH Swiss mice. Mice were exposed to a single concentration of BD (1250 p. p. m.) for 6 h. Bone marrow cell preparations were made at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h after cessation of exposure. In both strains comparable increases in the frequency of chromosomal <b>aberrations</b> (of the <b>chromatid</b> type) were observed following exposure to BD. Significant differences in the number of chromosomes were not observed, although a pattern of chromosomal loss in cells from treated animals was observed. These results indicate that BD-treatment in vivo produces significant increases in <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> but not aneuploidy in both strains. Therefore it is concluded that bone marrow toxidty, including cytogenetic abnormalities, is not predictive of leukemogenicity in these mice...|$|R
40|$|BALB/Mo mice lymphocytes, {{carrying}} endogenous Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV), show {{significantly higher}} in vitro baseline frequencies of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) than lymphocytes from control (M-MuLV free) BALB/c mice. In vitro treatment of lymphocytes with cordycepin (10 micrograms/ml), an antiviral substance, lowers the level of SCE in BALB/Mo cells to the same value of BALB/c cells. The drug also reduces the higher sensitivity of BALB/Mo compared to BALB/c lymphocytes to the induction of SCE by mitomycin C (MMC) administered either in vitro (3 x 10 (- 8), 10 (- 7) M) or in vivo (0. 3, 3 mg/kg). BALB/Mo lymphocytes treated in vivo with a high dose of MMC (10 mg/kg) show reduced susceptibility to the induction of SCE but increased frequencies of chromatid breaks and micronuclei. In this situation, cordycepin increases the level of SCE in BALB/Mo lymphocytes to exactly the level seen in BALB/c cells, {{but it does not}} affect the frequency of chromosomal aberrations. Since cordycepin is known to inhibit poly(A) synthesis, thus blocking RNA maturation, it is suggested that M-MuLV proviral integration is not the sole factor responsible for the altered susceptibility of BALB/Mo lymphocytes to SCE induction, but that it is most likely viral gene expression that is needed for this effect to occur. On the contrary, the high susceptibility of BALB/Mo lymphocytes to the induction of <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations</b> by a high dose of MMC administered in vivo seems to be independent of viral maturation...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} has been perfected for enabling good microscope preparations to {{be obtained from}} the larval ganglia of Drosophila melanogaster. This system was then tested with X-rays and an extensive series of data was obtained on the chromosome aberrations induced in the various stages of the cell cycle. —The analysis of the results obtained offers the following points of interest: (1) There exists a difference in radio-sensitivity between the two sexes. The females constantly display a greater frequency of both chromosome and <b>chromatid</b> <b>aberrations.</b> They also display a greater frequency of spontaneous aberrations. (2) In both sexes the overall chromosome damage is greater in cells irradiated in stages G 2 and G 1. These two peaks of greater radiosensitivity are produced by a high frequency of terminal deletions and chromatid exchanges and by a high frequency of dicentrics, respectively. (3) The aberrations are not distributed at random among the various chromosomes. On the average, the Y chromosome is found to be more resistant and the breaks are preferentially localized in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of the X chromosome and of the autosomes. (4) Somatic pairing influences the frequency and type of the chromosome aberrations induced. In this system, such an arrangement of the chromosomes results in a high frequency of exchanges and dicentrics between homologous chromosomes and a low frequency of scorable translocations. Moreover, somatic pairing, probably by preventing the formation of looped regions in the interphase chromosomes, results in the almost total absence of intrachanges at both chromosome and chromatid level...|$|R
