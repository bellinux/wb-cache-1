5|$|India— This civilization has no {{villager}} {{cards at}} the Home City, but they receive one villager with almost every shipment. All villagers {{that are not}} shipped from the Home City cost wood instead of food. Villagers are also not allowed to harvest livestock for food, but instead <b>can</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> structure called a Sacred Field which generates experience points whenever livestock are tasked to it. Sepoys (Musketeers), Gurkha (Skirmishers) and Rajputs (much like Rodeleros) are the primary infantry units, and India has several types of camel and elephant cavalry. Both of India's Brahmin monks ride atop elephants and can heal other units {{from the start of}} the game. Their Home City is Delhi and their leader is Akbar the Great.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrestrial}} Argonemertes dendyi is {{a native}} of Australia but has been found in the British Isles, in Sao Miguel in the Azores, in Gran Canaria, and in a lava tube cave at Kaumana on the Island of Hawaii. It <b>can</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> cocoon, which allows it to avoid desiccation while being transported, and it may be able to build populations quickly in new areas as it is a protandrous hermaphrodite. Another terrestrial genus, Geonemertes, is mostly found in Australasia but has species in the Seychelles, widely across the Indo-Pacific, in Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic, in Frankfurt, in the Canary Islands, in Madeira and in the Azores.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the club}} {{stated that they}} would either have to {{renovate}} Aspmyra for NOK200 million or build a new stadium elsewhere to remain competitive at a premiership level. Funding was proposed to be a mix of public and sponsor grants, including DA-funds. As part of the planning of a joint Norwegian and Swedish bid for the Euro 2016, Bodø Municipality and Bodø/Glimt proposed that Bodø could build a stadium at Rønvikjordene, {{in the northern part}} of the town. The plans were presented in late July 2008; the venue was planned to have a capacity for 30,000 to 35,000 spectators, but would be rebuilt after the tournament to seat 10,000 to 15,000. It was estimated that Bodø/Glimt would need a capacity for 10,000 to 15,000 spectators. In comparison, the population of Bodø was 46,049 in 2008. The new venue was estimated to cost NOK500 to 700 million and was largely proposed financed with DA-funds. Minister of Culture, Trond Giske, stated that at least one of the venues would have to be in Northern Norway to receive government support for an application. Aspmyra was planned used as a training pitch. Bodø was discarded for the Scandinavian bid, which ultimately was never sent to UEFA. For Aspmyra, the municipality has stated that they have the long-term option to purchase the real estate north of the pitch and <b>can</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new stand there. Alternatively, an estimated NOK3 million can be used to demolish the stand and redevelop it as a commercial property.|$|E

25|$|The {{generation}} of a protein sequence {{is much easier}} than the determination of a protein structure. However, {{the structure of a}} protein gives much more insight in the function of the protein than its sequence.

25|$|To keep captives happy, certain needs {{will need}} to be fulfilled, such as food, rest, religion, fear, and order. Pirates, however, prefer anarchy and defense, along with grub, grog, wenches, and betting from various {{entertainment}} buildings as well as resting and stashing at personal homes. Anarchy measures the level of disorder in an area. Captives are prevented from escaping through the fear mechanic, which is maintained by special structures. Escaped workers may report to other monarchs and cause uprisings. Pirate ships may be built at boatyards or shipyards, and are used to plunder other islands or board enemy ships to steal gold with which the player <b>can</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> greater pirate base and occasionally wealthy captives, who do not work but have a ransom that increases as they use entertainment buildings. There are also several challenging scenarios in which the goal is to survive in harsh environments, from angry pirates to escaping captives.|$|E
25|$|However, it {{is often}} {{desirable}} to represent rotations {{by a set of}} three numbers, known as Euler angles (in numerous variants), both because this is conceptually simpler, and because one <b>can</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> combination of three gimbals to produce rotations in three dimensions. Topologically this corresponds to a map from the 3-torus T3 of three angles to the real projective space RP3 of rotations, and the resulting map has imperfections due to this map being unable to be a covering map. Specifically, the failure of the map to be a local homeomorphism at certain points is referred to as gimbal lock, and is demonstrated in the animation at the right – at some points (when the axes are coplanar) the rank of the map is 2, rather than 3, meaning that only 2 dimensions of rotations can be realized from that point by changing the angles. This causes problems in applications, and is formalized by the notion of a covering space.|$|E
