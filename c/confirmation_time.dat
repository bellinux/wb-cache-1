5000|$|In the 2013 film adaptation, Daisy {{is portrayed}} by Carey Mulligan. Mulligan had two 90-minute auditions, which she {{found to be}} fun and served as her initial {{encounters}} with Leonardo DiCaprio, who portrayed Gatsby, and who read with her both days. Mulligan left the audition, unsure she had secured the role, but was satisfied to have played off DiCaprio. Mulligan read the novel in preparation for auditioning for the role, finding the book to be accessible due to its length. Mulligan {{was familiar with the}} dislike some readers of The Great Gatsby had for the character, but felt she could not [...] "think that about her, because I can't play her thinking she's awful." [...] Mulligan strayed from watching Farrow's prior portrayal of Daisy, believing she might steal from Farrow's performance subconsciously for her own. Director Baz Luhrmann confirmed Mulligan had been cast as Daisy in November 2010, one month after she acquired the role. After the <b>confirmation,</b> <b>Time</b> assessed Mulligan as being attractive but in a childlike way, a contrast to Daisy's womanly beauty in the novel. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter in his review of the film wrote that viewers had their own ideals about Daisy's character and would debate whether Mulligan [...] "has the beauty, the bearing, the dream qualities desired for the part, but she lucidly portrays the desperate tear Daisy feels between her unquestionable love for Gatsby and fear of her husband." [...] Tricia Paoluccio portrayed Daisy in the American Masters episode [...] "Novel Reflections: The American Dream". Starting in 2006, in the Simon Levy version of the play, Daisy was portrayed by Heidi Armbruster, who according to Quinton Skinner, [...] "is full of loony momentary enthusiasms and a dangerous sensuality, though by the second act, Armbruster’s perf veers toward hollow mannerisms." [...] Daisy was portrayed by Monte McGrath in the 2012 version of the play, and her performance was met with acclaim. Daisy is portrayed by Madeleine Herd in an adaptation by Independent Theater productions.|$|E

30|$|This {{research}} {{also shows that}} bedside upper airway ultrasonography has a quick mean time of 16 s. Other methods of ultrasonography verification of endotracheal tube placement such as TRUE also shows a fast <b>confirmation</b> <b>time</b> of 14.8 s [14]. Among patients with obesity, verification of endotracheal tube location by sonography is as quick as auscultation alone and quicker than the usual methods of auscultation and capnography [45]. Since US confirmation is quick enough; {{it can be used}} to identify oesophageal intubation before pumping air to the patient and prevents unintended stomach ventilation. Therefore, ultrasound can replace capnography in the primary verification of ETT location, in centres with no capnography facility.|$|E
30|$|By design, {{efficiency}} {{is one of}} the most important concerns for blockchain.

30|$|Confirming the {{position}} of Nasogastric tubes (NGT) in critical care is a controversial area. The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) guidance [1] advocates pH testing although use is limited in ICU due to continuous enteral feeding and proton pump inhibitor therapy. Chest X-ray is therefore commonly used with trainee doctors often being responsible for confirming tube position. Following three incidents of undetected NGT misplacement (outside of our ICU), our trust stipulated a change in practice so that only radiologists or ICU consultants were allowed to confirm placement. We were concerned that this could negatively influence tube <b>confirmation</b> <b>times</b> and enteral nutrition (EN) provision. Cumulative calorie deficits contribute to malnutrition [2]. Under-nutrition in critically ill patients is associated with increased mortality, infections and length of stay [3].|$|R

The evaluation shows that Promote-IT performs better than the other heuristic schedulers. Additionally, Promote-IT provides response-times near the optimum in cases where the optimal scheduler can be computed...|$|R
30|$|Introduction: Enteral {{nutrition}} (EN) {{is currently}} the route of choice for feeding critically ill patients (1); however, due to the unpredictable nature of critical illness, the delivery is frequently disrupted. Common reasons for inadequate delivery are gastrointestinal intolerance, fasting for diagnostic procedures, surgery and airway management (2). Cumulative calorie deficits contribute to malnutrition (3) and poor outcome including increased infections, length of ICU /hospital stay and mortality (4). There is no recognised guidance {{on the length of}} time that should elapse between stopping EN and commencing anaesthetic procedures. We developed and implemented our own fasting guidelines to address the EN interruptions on our units. In our trust, only radiologists or ICU consultants are allowed to confirm placement. We believe that this is negatively influencing tube <b>confirmation</b> <b>times</b> and contributing to EN under delivery.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{we did not}} {{sufficiently}} investigate oesophageal intubations. The rate for oesophageal intubation during the initial intubation was 5.6 % (6 out of 107 cases) with only six oesophageal intubation noted as compared to that previously reported by Schwartz [2]. This may cause the study's high specificity and sensitivity. Thus, the bias is because every intubation was done {{under the supervision of}} a senior medical officer or emergency physician. Patients who were intubated outside the emergency department, for example, patients who were from extra-hospitals settings, are excluded from this study as <b>confirmation</b> <b>time</b> could not be calculated. Usually, patients who were intubated in extra-hospitals settings were done by less experienced personnel.

Our proof of luck blockchain uses a TEE platform's random number generation to choose a consensus leader, which offers low-latency transaction validation, deterministic <b>confirmation</b> <b>time,</b> negligible energy consumption, and equitably distributed mining.

Criminals design and implement botnets in a complex way in order to hide their identities. Most notably the fact that criminals build command-and-control (C&C) infrastructures to manage their botnets. A botnet command-and-control mechanism (C&C) can be designed in various ways. The key principle behind designing a C&C mechanism is anonymity. Hence, criminals can propagate their instructions to botnets without revealing their identities. Since every new C&C mechanism increases the bar of anonymity, it is getting harder to trace and analyze botnets. In this thesis, we designed and implemented a C&C mechanism, btc-botnet, that runs over Bitcoin network. Btcbotnet has significant features over existing C&C mechanisms such as anonymity and resistance by its nature. We built a library that allows to use Bitcoin network as an underlying infrastructure for C&C mechanism.

40|$|Background: Wilms tumour is a {{comparatively}} common paediatric malignancy {{with a relatively}} good prognosis. Routine post-treatment surveillance at our institution currently includes regular abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) {{over a two-year period}} for the early detection of disease recurrence. The rationale is that early salvage therapy may improve overall patient survival, and thus justifies the exposure to potentially harmful ionising radiation. Objective: To critically evaluate the routine use of post-treatment abdominopelvic CT by determining the detection rate of disease recurrence and associated clinical outcomes. Methods: Sixty-four patients in remission following initial treatment for Wilms tumour were included in this retrospective study. Variables obtained from patient records included gender, age, histological grading and tumour stage at presentation, number of abdominopelvic CT scans, site(s) of relapse, method of recurrence detection and <b>confirmation,</b> <b>time</b> to recurrence and clinical outcome. Results: The patients received a total of 334 surveillance abdominopelvic CT scans. Nine (14 %) patients developed disease recurrence during the follow-up period. In three cases, the initial detection method was abdominopelvic CT. All three of these patients subsequently died despite salvage therapy (22 months median survival). Five false-positive diagnoses of recurrence occurred, with two being made on abdominopelvic CT. Conclusion: Routine post-treatment abdominopelvic CT showed a low detection rate of disease recurrence in children treated for Wilms tumour, while subjecting patients to a large radiation burden. The recommendation is that current practice be changed in line with the ultrasound-based Société Internationale d’Oncologie Pédiatrique (SIOP) imaging guidelines. </p...|$|E
