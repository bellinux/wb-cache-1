In the described period, the pilot installation for the production of new nitric-phosphoric fertiliser - precipitate (bi-phosphate). In 1933-1938 the factory in Mościce produced such nitric fertilizers: ammonium sulphate, nitro-chalk, lime saltpetre, in the initial period also nitrofos {{and at the end of}} that period precipitate (bi-phosphate).

50|$|Upon {{the launch}} of the main {{installations}} in “Tarnów II”, in Azoty in Tarnów, 4 basic technological lines were visibly distinguished: nitric compounds, organic compounds of methane, chloric compound and caprolactam derivatives. In the first half of 70’s of the previous century, the further changes in the material base for ammonia production were introduced. This was due to economic reasons and lower production capability of the installations generating gas for ammonia synthesis than the capabilities of the modernised and constructed ammonia syntheses in the period of Tarnów II. It was decided to purchase the installation for methane conversion with water steam at the nickel <b>catalyser</b> with capacity of 500 tons of ammonia per day in order to change the material basis. This unit was given the subsequent number 5 and was commonly called the “change of base”. The new installation was launched in September 1973. As a result, it was stopped to produce ammonia on the basis of water gas out of expensive coke. The old generators that were {{one of the most important}} pre-war installations in Azoty were withdrawn from use.|$|E

Emotional capital {{is a crucial}} capital: more than an additional capital, {{it is also a}} booster capital. If social, cultural and, human capitals are often complementary (Coleman,1993), emotional capital has a particular place among them. It is first a <b>catalyser</b> as it is essential for the constitution of the human capital. Indeed, human capital constitution might never happen if basic or appropriate emotional capital is not there. Only ad hoc emotional capital will allow human capital formation. Also, emotional capital is a potentionalizing - boostering- capital more than a simple additional capital as it is essential for utilizing effectively the social capital and the Becker Human capital (the way it has been restrictedly measured as general knowledge and technical skills). EK is a crucial capital as it impacts people's learning processes, especially for children and young people at risk, enables balanced human development, which participates in social cohesion, smoother human relationships, future successful life in the society and already to their school retention and success and as well as at work.

50|$|Mediatization {{works as}} a {{preferential}} source of deterritorialization, while it becomes a <b>catalyser</b> of other sources of deterritorialization (migrations, tourism, vast shopping centres, and economical transformations). As Tomlinson points out, mediatization is absolutely omnipresent in everyday contemporary cultural experiences, it therefore appears as clearly decisive in deterritorialized cultural experience. The aforementioned experience implies opening up {{to the world and}} amplifying cultural horizons through the globalized mass media. This means that globalization transforms the relation between the places where we live and our cultural activities, experiences and identities. Paradoxically, deterritorialization also includes reterritorialized manifestations, which García Canclini defines as “certain relative, partial territorial relocalizations of old and new symbolic productions”. According to the concept of glocalization proposed by Robertson, deterritorialization and reterritorialization constitute both {{sides of the same coin}} of cultural globalization. Deterritorialization speaks of the loss of the “natural” relation between culture and the social and geographic territories, and describes a deep transformation of the link between our everyday cultural experiences and our configuration as preferably local beings. As Giddens argues, “the very tissue of spatial experience alters, conjoining proximity and distance in ways that have few close parallels in prior ages”. Nevertheless, it is very important not to interpret the deterritorialization of localized cultural experiences as an impoverishment of cultural interaction, but as a transformation produced by the impact the growing cultural transnational connections have on the local realm, which means that deterritorialization generates a relativization and a transformation of local cultural experiences, whether it is from the local event itself or by the projection of symbolical shapes from the local event.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the methods}} for {{utilization}} of waste carbon dioxide consists in reaction of methane with carbon dioxide, referred to as dry reforming of methane. It is an intensely endothermic catalytic process that {{takes place at the}} temperature above 700 °C. Reaction of methane with carbon dioxide leads to formation of synthesis gas (syngas) that is a valuable chemical raw material. The energy that is necessary for the process to take place can be sourced from High Temperature Nuclear Reactors (HTR). The completed studies comprises a series of thermodynamic calculations and made it possible to establish optimum conditions for the process and demand for energy from HTR units. The dry reforming of methane needs also a catalytic agent with appropriate activity, therefore the hydrotalcite <b>catalyser</b> with admixture of cerium and nickel, developed at AGH University of Technology seems to be a promising solution. Thus, the researchers from the Institute for Chemical Processing of Coal (IChPW) in Zabrze have developed a methodology for production of the powdery hydrotalcite <b>catalyser</b> and investigated catalytic properties of the granulate obtained. The completed experiments confirmed that the new <b>catalyser</b> demonstrated high activity and is suitable for the process of methane dry reforming. In addition, optimum parameters of the were process (800 °C, CO 2 :CH 4 = 3 : 1) were established as well. Implementation of the technology in question into industrial practice, combined with utilization of HTR heat can be a promising method for management of waste carbon dioxide and may eventually lead to mitigation of the greenhouse effect...|$|E

40|$|Trabajo presentado a la: "European Hydrogen Energy Conference" celebrada en Sevilla (España) del 12 al 14 {{de marzo de}} 2014. Microtubular Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (MT-SOFC) have {{recently}} attracted much interest as they are more resistant to thermal cycling, and they present shorter start-up/shut-down times and higher volumetric power densities {{in comparison with the}} traditional planar geometry. Standard NiO-YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) tubes used in our laboratory are fabricated by either extrusion or cold isostatic pressing (CIP) of NiO, YSZ and pore former powders, followed by spray coating or dipcoating of the YSZ electrolyte. Both components are then co-sintered at 1400 ºC. Typical oxygen electrodes such as LSCF (lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite) or LSM (lanthanum strontium manganite) are deposited by dip-coating and sintered at 1150 ºC. Thermo-mechanical matching of cell components, <b>catalyser</b> coarsening and quality of interfaces are important issues in cell fabrication. Fabrication of electrodes by infiltration may contribute to reduce some of these problems as the cathode sintering stage is no longer needed. In this case we fabricate the oxygen electrode by infiltration of different cathode materials into a porous YSZ structure. One of the advantages of this fabrication method is an increased of TPB (triple-phase boundary) length compared with the standard cathode due to the smallest size of the dispersed <b>catalyser</b> particles having a higher surface area. In addition, since no sintering process of the cathode is needed the formation of nonconducting secondary phases such as non-conducting zirconates, and also the coarsening of the <b>catalyser</b> during sintering is eliminated. In the present work, results about infiltrated LSM cathodes using different LSM concentrations will be shown. The j-V (current density-voltage) measurements showed an increase of near 20...|$|E

The origin of the bands has been approached by considering photoluminescence of base resin and hardener taken separately, of their mixture, {{and in the course}} of curing. Most of the bands observed in the cured resin could be interpreted based on those found in the components taken separately. Fluorescence of the cured resin appears dominated by two broad bands that are characteristic of the hardener and exhibits a blue shift by up to 30 nm in the course of curing which could be used for cure monitoring purpose of the investigated system. Fluorescence of the base resin is clearly detected in the resin cured with tertiary amine as <b>catalyser.</b> However, it is very weak if the <b>catalyser</b> is not added. Two phosphorescence processes have been isolated in the cured resin, one of them being related to the base resin.

40|$|Are {{international}} organizations a positive force in improving good governance and reducing corruption? International organizations {{have traditionally been}} perceived as a positive force in international politics.

In a study on the role of international organizations as constructers, supervisors and <b>catalysers</b> of the carbon market through the clean development mechanism (CDM), the paper shows that {{there are at least three}} major explanations why international organizations may promote bad rather than good government norms: leadership explanations, market logic explanation and informational explanations. The paper thereby shows the benefits of moving beyond descriptions of system level features, such as inbuilt transparency mechanisms, to also study the effect that systems have on participants involved.

The label “intermediaries” {{is not meant}} to be reductive. Intermediaries do not merely offer matchmaking services, but provide a wide range of knowledge-intensive services including, among others, knowledge and technology mapping, technical assistance in R&D projects, dissemination and commercialisation of research results, support for universityindustry collaborations (Bessant and Rush, 1995; Lynn et al, 1996; Hargadon and Sutton, 1997; Den Hertog, 2000; Howells, 2006; Doganova, 2013).

40|$|Biotic {{interactions}} are often acknowledged as <b>catalysers</b> of genetic divergence and eventual explanation of processes driving species richness. We address the question, whether extreme ecological specialization is always associated with lineage sorting, by analysing polymorphisms in morphologically similar ecotypes of the myrmecophilous butterfly Maculinea alcon. The ecotypes occur in either hygric or xeric habitats, use different larval host plants and ant species, but no significant distinctive molecular traits have been revealed so far. We apply genome-wide RAD-sequencing to specimens originating from both habitats across Europe {{in order to}} get a view of the potential evolutionary processes at work. Our results confirm that genetic variation is mainly structured geographically but not ecologically — specimens from close localities are more related to each other than populations of each ecotype from distant localities. However, we found two loci for which the association with xeric versus hygric habitats is supported by segregating alleles, suggesting convergent evolution of habitat preference. Thus, ecological divergence between the forms probably does not represent an early stage of speciation, but may result from independent recurring adaptations involving few genes. We discuss the implications of these results for conservation and suggest preserving biotic interactions and main genetic clusters...|$|R
