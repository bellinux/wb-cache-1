50|$|The APAS to LIDS Adaptor System (ATLAS) was {{announced}} in 2008. It would have {{been placed on the}} open PMAs and converted APAS-95 to the Low Impact Docking System (LIDS). ATLAS was planned to be launched on Orion's first two missions to the International Space Station. Orion's missions to the ISS were later canceled altogether and its role as a <b>crew</b> <b>transporter</b> was replaced by the Commercial Crew Program.|$|E

5000|$|Meaney first {{appeared}} on Star Trek: The Next Generation in its 1987 pilot episode, [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", as an unnamed helm officer. His character became a frequently recurring one, and was given the name of Miles O'Brien as he became more prominent in the <b>crew</b> as <b>Transporter</b> Chief. In 1993, Meaney left The Next Generation for a more prominent regular role in its spin-off Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and remained on that show until its final episode, in 1999. With 225 total appearances on Star Trek, he has made more appearances on the franchise than any other actor except Michael Dorn.|$|R

50|$|A {{considerable}} {{part of the}} Russian Space Agency's {{budget is}} used for the ISS. Since 1998 there have been over two dozen Soyuz and Progress flights, the primary <b>crew</b> and cargo <b>transporters</b> since 2003. The question of how much Russia spends on the station (measured in USD), is, however, not easy to answer. The two modules currently in orbit are derivatives of the Mir program and therefore development costs are much lower than for other modules. In addition, the exchange rate between ruble and USD is not adequately giving a real comparison to what the costs for Russia really are.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The artisanal {{mining sector}} is largely informal, yet {{provides}} an essential livelihood for many dependants, {{as well as}} facilitating an important source for the flow of income into many communities. Artisanal mining varies from site to site, but appears largely well structured despite its informality. The artisanal mining sites in Central Africa have some inherent management structure and the extraction itself is often organised through teams of about 20 diggers who co-operate in one underground excavation. The miners are generally accompanied by supporting crews e. g. developers, timbering <b>crews,</b> rock <b>transporters,</b> rock crushers, mineral washers and waste disposal crews. Underground operations are based largely on exploiting payable pegmatite veins or mineralised material with little consideration made for mine planning issues such as mine access, rock breaking, material handling, support, ventilation or general safety considerations. Typical problems encountered in artisanal mining are poorly excavated mine accesses, which are often either unsupported or excavated to inappropriate sizes. Travelling ways promoting easy access are often lacking with material handling largely conducted by manual methods. Artisanal mining operations are largely excavated by manual labour with limited ventilation and working under conditions of limited or no illumination and are generally conducted utilising hand digging methods e. g. shovels, picks or hand chisels. This paper investigates artisanal mining in underground workings as currently applied in Central Africa and proposes best practice guidelines to uplift artisanal mining to small scale mining. Areas under investigation are mine access, pillar support, improved rock breaking, material handling and ventilation, and mining methods. This paper investigates practical methods to improve underground mining safety in the artisanal mining environment and promotes ways to improve miners’ knowledge so as to promote mining operations to migrate from labour and manual intensive methods to semi-mechanised methods. Along with improving productivity, basic mine planning principles are described promoting safer and more efficient mining methods than what are currently being applied...|$|R
