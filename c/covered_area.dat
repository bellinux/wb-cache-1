5|$|Lincoln is {{equipped}} with a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar, one of 159 high-resolution Doppler weather radars operated by the National Weather Service. The Lincoln office is also equipped with an Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) that greatly increases monitoring capabilities of weather, satellite, and computer model data by forecasters. In addition the Lincoln office is also in charge of Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) at General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport and Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport. NWS Lincoln employs both short and long term weather forecasters who each have vital duties. The short term forecaster issues the Hazardous Weather Outlook, river forecast products and monitors thunderstorm activity as it develops. The long term forecaster plans weather forecasts up until seven days into the future, coordinates with other long term forecasters in neighboring regions and issues advisories for Winter weather and dense fog. There are also meteorologists assigned to data acquisition responsibilities, staff in this position are responsible for monitoring weather balloons, river stage observations, operation of the NOAA weather radio system and operations of the cooperative observer network. During times of Severe Weather NWS Lincoln divides its <b>covered</b> <b>area</b> into various geographic districts with different forecasters handling the severe weather operation {{of his or her own}} sector. Depending on the severity of the outbreak NWS Lincoln employs 2 to 6 meteorologists to issue any warnings. Volunteer HAM radio operators are also present during most severe weather outbreaks, coordinating information between weather spotters and forecasters.|$|E
40|$|Gulf of Martaban {{is located}} at the north of Andaman, {{and is one of the}} world most turbid areas. The {{presence}} of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the water body could reduce the underwater transmittance. This study has been conducted to investigate the variation of SSC over the Gulf of Martaban. Remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) of 667 nm is used as a proxy to represent the sediment SSC variation over the study area. The data for the period of July 2002 to March 2014 acquired from MODIS Aqua 4 km resolution are used in this study. As a result, there is no obvious yearly variation in the SSC <b>cover</b> <b>area.</b> The SSC variation over this study area is found to be seasonal. High homogenous SSC <b>covers</b> <b>area</b> observably during the northeast (NE) monsoon season that occurs from December to January. The sediment <b>cover</b> <b>area</b> could reach the latitude of 15 °N that located at the south of the gulf. During southwest (SW) monsoon season that occurs from May to September, low and sparse SSC <b>cover</b> <b>area</b> is observed. As a consequence, the <b>area</b> <b>covered</b> by the SSC is higher during the NE monsoon season as compared to the SW monsoon season. Hence, the SSC <b>cover</b> <b>area</b> during the NE monsoon season is greater than the yearly averaged SSC <b>cover</b> <b>area.</b> Meanwhile the SSC <b>cover</b> <b>area</b> during the rainy SW monsoon season is less than the yearly and NE monsoon season...|$|R

Actually, the concurrent flow correlation model explained more than 90 percent of the variability {{in the flow of}} these rivers. Compared to this model, the snow <b>cover</b> <b>area</b> runoff models explained less of the variability in flow.

At the cargo terminal, AAI functions as ground handling agency for airlines for handling or processing their cargo on ground and acts as custodian on behalf of customs import/export cargo under the customs act of 1962. Spread over an area of 19.5 acres, the complex uses cargo-handling equipments such as elevated transfer vehicle, forklifts, high-mast stackers, and power hydraulic pallet trucks for handling cargo. The <b>covered</b> <b>area</b> of the export wing of the complex is 20,595sqm while that of the import wing is 20,090sqm.

Built in Renaissance, mission or classic styles, the NYW stations are considered among the most well-designed depots in the country. The design of the Quaker Ridge station’s peaked roof was inspired by Manhattan’s Pennsylvania Station.

Trams stop at the first platform to allow passengers to alight, then pull up to the second platform to allow boarding. The use of the loop avoids having to terminate the vehicles and the removes the need for the driver to change ends. This loop was not new; it had been used until 1957 as a route on the former Sydney tramway system, but in the opposite direction. The <b>covered</b> <b>area</b> in which the light rail stop is located was previously used as a staff car-park and bus interchange.
