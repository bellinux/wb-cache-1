The flow field considered is in a modeled nanoporous medium whose porosity is 0. 88 and consists of square <b>cylinder</b> <b>rods.</b> The equations used in the LBM are modified lattice Boltzmann equations introducing Knudsen number dependency. In the MD simulations, novel boundary treatments are applied. The results of a nano-porous flow at a Knudsen number Kn= 0. 24 show reasonable agreement in both the simulation methods and confirm the reliability of the LBM. The difference in the predicted values of the permeability, however, implies that the wall boundary condition of the LBM requires further improvement...|$|E

A realizable cubic low-Reynolds number k-Ã‰Â› turbulence model and a linear V 2 F model are utilized to capture transitional effects, in particular the laminar separation bubble at the suction side. For comparison with experimental data, published in a companion paper, pressure distribution and boundary layer profiles of the mean and fluctuation RMS velocity are considered. While the periodically disturbed flow is predicted with a reasonable accuracy by each model, for the undisturbed flow, an additional realizability condition based on a turbulent time scale bound is incorporated into the cubic model in order to capture the reattachment of the flow...|$|E
40|$|Inorganic {{coatings}} {{are widely}} used to protect carbon steel hydraulic <b>cylinder</b> <b>rods</b> from wear and corrosion in aggressive offshore environment. Different types of lay-ers such as Ni/Cr, Al 2 O 3, Cr 2 O 3, TiO 2, and Inconel 625 layers were applied to the carbon steels by plasma, High Velocity Oxygen Fuel (HVOF) and laser cladding methods. The anti-corrosion properties of the coated systems were investigated by exposure tests and EIS measurements in seawater at room temperature. The {{results show that the}} laser cladding layers have the best corrosion performance among the coated systems studied. The corrosion resistance for the galvanized Ni layer is bet-ter than the Ni layer plus a Cr layer on the top, since the porous Cr layer causes the Ni corrosion underneath. The corrosion resistance for the Ni plus Cr layers increases with the thickness of the Cr layer. The WC layers applied to the Metco 1005 interme-diate layer using HVOF method have also a better corrosion performance than the Al 2 O 3 -TiO 2 and Cr 2 O 3 -TiO 2 layers applied to the Ni/Cr layers using plasma method within the test period. The Ni/Cr layer applied by plasma and the Metco 1005 layer applied by HVOF without a top ceramic layer showed limited corrosion protection...|$|E
50|$|Side loading is unequal {{pressure}} {{that is not}} centered on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>rod.</b> This off-center strain can lead to bending of the rod in extreme cases, but more commonly causes leaking due to warping the circular seals into an oval shape. It can also damage and enlarge the bore hole around the rod and the inner cylinder wall around the piston head, if the rod is pressed hard enough sideways to fully compress and deform the seals to make metal-on-metal scraping contact.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} global {{finite element}} simulations of a hydro-pneumatic riser tension cylinder used for tensioning and heave compensating of marine drilling risers. The global {{finite element models}} are made for use on a personal computer, which give some limits in available computational capacity, but convenient {{for use of the}} models. The main goal for the simulations is to find the contact forces acting between the <b>cylinder</b> <b>rod</b> surface layer and the bearing rings inside the stuffing box of the cylinder. This information is needed to understand the reasons for the excessive wear of surface layers that has been experienced and lead to costly damages of heave compensation systems. To establish the models a literature study of riser analysis, heave compensation and friction between surfaces modelling is done and described. Measurement of friction forces in order to identify the Stribeck curve for the bearing material has been done on a test cylinder, lubricated with a fire resistant water glycol hydraulic fluid. The friction force is measured as a function of contact pressure and speed at different temperature, which are the parameters needed to define the Stribeck curve for the actual system. The size of the bearing and the difference in friction force between boundary lubrication friction and mixed lubrication friction described by the Stribeck curve, bring in modelling issues for the time domain analysis. The size of the bearing requires small finite elements, which in turn requires very short time increments in order to obtain stable time integration when using an explicit method. The fast variation in friction force gives convergence issues also for the implicit integration method. Computational costs are therefore high for the applied type of simulation. The results show that metal to metal contact between <b>cylinder</b> <b>rod</b> and stuffing box may occur in certain situations even within the design limit of cylinder, due to high contact pressure and bending of the rod. The main contributing factors to this high contact pressure and bending are: • Bending moments in the <b>cylinder</b> and <b>rod</b> occur due to weight of the structure when it has a spatial inclination relative to the vertical. • Lateral accelerations of the cylinder ends due to vessel and drilling riser motions. • Low bending stiffness of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>rod</b> when the riser tension is low...|$|R

40|$|Generally, fault {{detection}} {{is the process}} of monitoring a physical dynamic system accompanied by confirmation and assessment of any degradation of system performance. These systems are mathematically modeled and terms that are representative of a specific fault are identified and monitored for detection. In this paper, a {{fault detection}} algorithm is developed to isolate and detect friction changes in a high precision positioning mechanism. The designed fault detection algorithm addresses dynamic model estimation, dynamic filtering and recursive parameter estimation techniques to monitor on-line friction changes. The procedure is illustrated on a high precision servo pneumatic cylinder that drives a translational air bearing apparatus, designed to permit the addition of friction. Side loading of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>rod</b> induced by a friction fault causes significant loss of performance in these applications.
