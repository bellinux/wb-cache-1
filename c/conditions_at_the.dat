It depicted {{construction workers}} who were satisfied with the working <b>conditions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> construction site. However, further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction-related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of One World Trade Center, including 34 not reported to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers also left post-9/11-related graffiti at the site, which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience.|$|E

5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites against blacks. ADDSCO {{management}} had long maintained segregated <b>conditions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them away for their safety.|$|E

5|$|Another home beckoned in 1959 {{with the}} {{renovation}} of the new Exhibition Stadium to accommodate Canadian football.

5|$|Blackburn's {{primary focus}} was on reforms to the state's penal system. According to Blackburn, 953 prisoners were being held at the state penitentiary, {{although}} the structure only contained 780 cells. Conditions in the penitentiary were poor and resulted in many illnesses. One fifth of the state's prisoners suffered from pneumonia in 1875. When Blackburn became governor in 1879, the mortality rate of the almost one thousand inmates in the state penitentiary was over 7 percent. Scurvy caused by poor nutrition afflicted 75 percent of prisoners. Blackburn compared <b>conditions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> penitentiary to the infamous Black Hole of Calcutta.|$|E

As a child, she went missing during a pilgrimage to the Godavari River pushkaram in Kakinada. <b>Conditions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school deteriorate due to mismanagement by Gopalam's nephew, A. K.

5|$|In April 1987 Reagan {{appointed}} Matlock as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. <b>Conditions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Embassy were tense, as Marine Sergeant Clayton Lonetree {{had been}} found to have compromised Embassy security. Within a few months of the Lonetree scandal, all U.S. intelligence assets in the Soviet Union had been exposed. The Americans suspected that the security breach had meant that the Embassy code room was no longer secure and worked frantically to determine how. It was not until 1994 that Aldrich Ames, a mole within the CIA, was caught. Another mole, Robert Hanssen, this time within the FBI, was caught only in 2001.|$|E

The reconstruction of Yeates' last movements was filmed on 18 January, and within 24 hours of news coverage about the production, over 300 people contacted the police. A breakthrough led investigators to believe that Yeates' body might have been transported in a large holdall or suitcase.|$|E

5|$|Limiting the {{availability}} of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 x 500mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 x 500mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic <b>conditions</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pharmacist's discretion. In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.

Blackburn called for the contract system to be replaced with a system of oversight by wardens employed by the state.|$|E
