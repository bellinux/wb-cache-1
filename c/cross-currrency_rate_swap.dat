40|$|In our {{paper we}} present the most {{important}} characteristics of the forint interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market, as well as examine the determinants and the information content of the forint interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> spreads. The turnover of the forint interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market has grown dynamically in recent years, and now it may reach, or even exceed, the turnover of the government bond market. Due to the hedging activity of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market makers, there is a close linkage between the forint interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market and the government bond market. In terms of investors, the interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> and government bond markets are strongly segmented. Consequently, the spillover from one market segment to the other is not perfect. Our analyses suggest that long-term forint interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> spreads {{are exposed to the}} common impact of several factors. The strongest effects are attributed to government bond purchases by residents, the Maggie A spread, the slope of the yield curve and the forint/euro forward yield spread. In the developments of swap spreads, the impact of those trading strategies employing interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> can be detected. These are widespread in the domestic market, as is confirmed by anecdotal information. The results indicate that in certain cases the swap yields, while at other times the government bond yields carry additional information about long-term yield expectations. The values of the 5 -year HUF/EUR forward spread 5 years ahead calculated from the swap yields and from the treasury yields differ markedly, and this difference is driven practically by the same factors that influence the interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> spreads. forint interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market, government securities market, interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> spread, swap spread model. ...|$|R

40|$|Section I of this {{dissertation}} {{develops the}} following topics: {{the mechanics of}} an interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap,</b> the reasons for usage of swaps, {{and the history of}} how the instrument evolved. An interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> is an agreement between two agents to trade interest payment obligations. The most powerful reason for the existence of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> is the ability to hedge interest rate risk;Section II theoretically and empirically examines the relationship between the use of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> and the level of capital in savings and loan associations. The results suggest that savings and loan associations tend to allocate more capital when they engage in swaps and that an increase in capital increases the likelihood of more swap market activity;The final section tests whether interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> can reduce fluctuations in stock prices of savings and loans by unanticipated interest rate changes. The results seem to suggest that interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> have only an indirect effect in reducing stock price variability...|$|R
40|$|Interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> is a {{derivative}} which is today routinely {{used in the}} financial sector worldwide. As opposed to that, the swap market in Serbia is reduced to basic versions of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> only, and {{is limited to the}} major users and providers of services in the financial market. Banks in Serbia have been introducing and promoting interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> as one of their services rather slowly, which can be deduced from various information on interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> and non-innovative offers of these instruments. On the other hand, companies are unable to recognize interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> as instruments of hedge against the negative effects of interest rate fluctuations, and a way to gain competitive edge in relation to other market participants. One of the obstacles for using interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> is unwillingness of companies to get informed and educated, and to enter new transactions. The volume of conducted swap transactions depends on the level of understanding on the part of their participants. Expansion of knowledge helps bridge the gap between theory and practice, thereby encouraging a more intensive implementation of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> {{market has}} grown rapidly. Since {{the inception of}} the swap market in 1981, the outstanding notional principal of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> has reached a level of $ 12. 81 trillion in 1995. Recent surveys indicate that interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> are the most commonly used interest rate derivative by nonfinancial firms and that nonfinancial firms are major users of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps.</b> In this paper, we provide an economic rationale for the use of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> by such nonfinancial firms. In a global economy, given the floating exchange rate regime, nonfinancial firms face economic exposure in the presence of foreign competition. Asymmetric information about economic exposure leads to mispricing of the firms' debt, and the firm chooses either short-term or long-term debt to minimize the cost of debt. We show that when there is a favorable (unfavorable) exchange rate shock, an exposed firm chooses short-term (long-term) debt together with fixed-for-floating (floating-for-fixed) interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps.</b> Given interest <b>rate</b> expectations, interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> enable the firm to minimize the cost of fixed or floating rate debt.

50|$|Two notable examples, U.A.E. Dirham and Saudi Riyal {{interest}} <b>rate</b> <b>swaps,</b> are {{quoted in}} the inter-bank market as spreads to US dollar interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps.</b> AED and SAR currency exchange rates are each pegged to the USD, hence their interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> markets are highly correlated to the US interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market respectively. e.g. if the SAR IRS Spread for a 5-year maturity is quoted as +150 basis points and the USD 5 year IRS fixed rate is trading at 1.00%, where the IRS fixed payments are annual and the floating payments are quarterly LIBOR, then the SAR 5 year IRS fixed rate will be 2.50%.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{a number of}} local {{authorities}} began to use interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> in order to hedge their exposure to interest rate fluctuations {{in relation to their}} borrowing. Interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> were still a relatively new commercial innovation at the time. Following the volatility of global interest rates in the 1970s, interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> became an increasingly popular way for borrowers to manage the risk of future volatility affecting their payment obligations. Although most of the subsequent reporting focused upon a few local authorities who were less circumspect, it appears that in the majority of cases local authorities used interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> in a prudent and measured manner as part of their financial management function.|$|R

40|$|Interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> {{agreements}} are rapidly gaining popularity as the tool {{of choice for}} managing financial uncertainties. Unfortunately, since th~ are relatively new and the FASB has not yet issued a formal pronouncement {{as to how they}} should be accounted for, {{it is up to the}} users of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> to decide on the accounting method. The FASB has, however, issued several pronouncements pertaining to disclosures about interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> in the financial statements. This paper defines what interest rates are, examines current reporting requirements, analyzes selected company disclosures, and determines how interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> should be accounted for. To accomplish my goal, I have researched existing FASB pronouncements, articles already written on the topic of interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps,</b> and I also looked at a number of annual reports to determine compliance with disclosure requirements. What I found was that even though the existing FASB pronouncements (SFAS No. 105, SFAS No. 107, and SFAS No. 119) specifically outline what types of information should be disclosed for interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> transactions, many companies meet only the minimum requirements, and some don't even meet the bare minimum. I believe that merely disclosing interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> in the footnotes to the financial statements is not enough. The swap transactions should be included on the face of the financial statements. The interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> agreements should be accounted for by marking them to market and they should be divided into those held for trading purposes, with gains or losses recognized in current income, and those held for other purposes, where gains or losses would be deferred as a separate component of equity.

50|$|To hedge {{costs on}} the sale of {{variable}} interest rate bonds, which can rise and fall with the market, local governments, such as Baltimore, purchased interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> which exchange a variable interest rate for a fixed interest <b>rate.</b> In a <b>swap</b> deal, when the interest <b>rate</b> rises, the <b>swap</b> seller pays the local government the increased cost on the bond, while when the interest <b>rate</b> falls, the <b>swap</b> seller saves and pays the local government the decreased cost on the bond. The interest <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> mechanism generally works well, however, between 2007 and 2010 the payments to local governments on their swaps artificially decreased but the cost on their bonds remained at actual market rates. This was because most interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> are linked to the Libor interest rate, while municipal bond rates are linked to the SIFMA Municipal Bond Index interest rate. During the financial crisis the two benchmark rates decoupled. Municipalities continued to pay on their bonds at the actual market Sifma rate but were paid on their interest <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> at the artificially lower Libor rate.|$|R
