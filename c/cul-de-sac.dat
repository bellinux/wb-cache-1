5|$|The show's storylines {{concern the}} {{domestic}} and professional {{lives of the}} people who live and work in Erinsborough, a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The series primarily centres on the residents of Ramsay Street, a short <b>cul-de-sac,</b> and its neighbouring area, the Lassiters complex, which includes a bar, hotel, cafe, police station, lawyers' office and park. Neighbours began with three families created by Watson – the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. Watson said that he wanted to show three families who are friends living in a small street. The Robinsons and the Ramsays had a long history and were involved in an ongoing rivalry. Pin Oak Court, in Vermont South, is the real <b>cul-de-sac</b> that has doubled for Ramsay Street since 1985.

5|$|According to Antonucci, he based the {{characters}} on real {{people in his}} life. The personalities of Ed, Double D, and Eddy are based on his own traits {{as well as the}} activities of his two sons, while the <b>cul-de-sac</b> children and the Kanker sisters were all based on children he grew up with. Rolf is based on Antonucci and his cousins, since he was part of an Italian immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living, compared to those born in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} Eds, the other <b>cul-de-sac</b> kids, and the Kanker Sisters, no other {{characters}} {{appeared in the}} series until the fifth season, when the silhouettes of other people were occasionally shown, and in one episode the arms of Eddy's father and Ed's mother were seen. In the series finale, Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show, Eddy's adult brother (Terry Klassen) was seen for the first time, making him the only non-main character, and the only adult character to ever fully appear on the show.|$|E
5|$|During the Olympics, {{transport}} {{was in part}} {{provided by}} Vikingskipet Station on the Røros Line, which passes {{right next to the}} venue. The station is a <b>cul-de-sac</b> station which is electrified and allowed trains during the Olympics and the Track Cycling World Championships to reach the venue within a short walk from the train. The station was officially opened on 16 August 1993. The station has not been used since the Olympics. In 2006, the Norwegian National Rail Administration proposed re-opening the station in conjunction with larger events.|$|E
40|$|Single entry {{communities}} (SECs) and <b>cul-de-sacs</b> minimize route {{choices and}} increase trip distance. Las Vegas' built environment facilitates {{the examination of}} these variables and active transport to school (ATS) rates. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the influence of SECs and <b>cul-de-sacs</b> on ATS rates in Las Vegas, NV elementary children. Parental-reported data was collected from 11 elementary schools on ATS rates (n =  1217). SECs and <b>cul-de-sacs</b> were quantified for each school zone. Logistic regression models were used to predict ATS. 23. 9 % of students reported ATS all of the time and 31. 4 % some of the time. SECs per school zone ranged from 0 to 25 (mean =  11. 9). <b>Cul-de-sacs</b> ranged from 12 to 315 (mean =  138. 3). Some ATS use was predicted by distance from school (p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 61), parental education (high school: p =  0. 004;OR =  0. 53, some college: p =  0. 001;OR =  0. 50, 4  year degree: p =  0. 004;OR =  0. 52) and <b>cul-de-sacs</b> (p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 99). A separate model using distance from school (p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 61), parental education (high school: p =  0. 002;OR =  0. 51, some college: p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 45, 4  year degree: p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 45) and SECs (p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 96) predicted some ATS. All ATS use was predicted by distance from school (p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 58), parental education (Grades 9 – 11 : p =  0. 05;OR =  0. 61, high school: p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 45, some college: p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 41, 4  year degree: p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 38) and SECs (p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 97). A separate model using distance from school (p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 58), parental education (Grades 9 – 11 : p =  0. 041;OR =  0. 59, high school: p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 47, some college: p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 44, 4  year degree: p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 43) and <b>cul-de-sacs</b> (p ≤  0. 001;OR =  0. 99) predicted all ATS. Current findings reveal that both SECs and <b>cul-de-sacs</b> were predictors of ATS beyond distance. Students with more SECs and <b>cul-de-sacs</b> in their school zone were less likely to utilize ATS...|$|R

5|$|Future {{projects}} {{will result in}} numerous changes. A full interchange will be constructed between Wellington County Road34 and Maltby Road; the intersection with the former will become an overpass while the latter will be closed, with Maltby Road terminating at a <b>cul-de-sac</b> {{on both sides of}} the expressway. Further north, a partial-access diamond interchange will be built at Downey Road/ Kortright Road West, with ramps from the northbound lanes and to the southbound lanes and the crossroad run beneath the expressway.|$|E
5|$|In Trondheim, the {{existing}} railway station for the Trondhjem–Støren Line was {{built as a}} <b>cul-de-sac</b> station at Kalvskinnet. This could not serve the Meråker Line and the station was thus moved to Brattøra, an artificial peninsula immediately {{north of the city}} center. Thus the station became located next to the new port facility. With the construction of the Røros Line, it was decided to connect both lines to the same station. The cost of the new station was 1.4 million kroner. Trondheim Station did not open until 1882.|$|E

The former <b>cul-de-sac</b> became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.|$|E

5|$|Head I, {{completed}} late in 1948, {{is considered}} {{more successful than}} Head II.

It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been publicising for a year, he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on, including several other popes.|$|E

NY31 would be widened from Gallup Road to NY531; a center median would be added and a portion of NY31 between NY531 and NY36 would become a <b>cul-de-sac</b> for the residences in the area.

5|$|The village {{stretches}} primarily along {{a single}} carriageway road known as The Street. The north-eastern end of The Street is a designated Conservation Area. The lack of development stems from its position within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and a Site of Nature Conservation Interest, which influences local planning laws and limits permission to build new housing. All development is subject to {{a high level of}} scrutiny; any development that would adversely affect the natural beauty of the landscape will automatically be resisted, and large-scale development proposals must be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment. The last major development was that of the residential <b>cul-de-sac</b> Draysfield.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small <b>cul-de-sac</b> that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000.
