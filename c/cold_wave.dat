5|$|Throughout the year, the South Pacific High {{influences}} the climate by bringing cold, moist air masses originating from Patagonia. During {{the most intense}} cold waves, they form when a transient high pressure system located in the South Pacific Ocean moves eastwards to {{the southern tip of}} South America. As it begins to move, this high pressure system strengthens the South Pacific High and is forced to move southwards to south of 40oS where the Andes are shorter in height. As well, an upper level ridge forms over the South Pacific Ocean along with an upper level trough extending from subtropical latitudes to the South Atlantic Ocean. At the same time, a low pressure system forms over the South Atlantic Ocean which eventually strengthens. The formation a cold front associated with it moves to the northeast owing to the topographic barrier that the Andes forms. The passage of the cold front to the northeast leads to the movement of the high pressure system from the South Pacific Ocean into the southern tip of South America. All of these conditions lead to strong anticyclogenesis to the east of the Andes and thus, the high pressure system intensifies as it enters southern Argentina. When both the high pressure system (over southern Argentina) and low pressure system strengthen, it creates a very strong pressure gradient that draws cold air from the south, strengthening southerly winds. Owing to the topographic barrier of the Andes, it forces and channels the cold air to accumulate on {{the eastern side of the}} Andes. This generates an ageostropic component from the south (due to a reduction in the Coriolis force caused by accumulation of cold air on the eastern side of the Andes) that draw this cold air northwards, which is driven by this pressure gradient. Cold air can move northwards until 18oS when the blocking effect of the Andes is smaller due to a change in its orientation. Overall, these conditions results in the coldest temperatures due to the cold masses from high latitudes being pulled northwards. A weaker <b>cold</b> <b>wave</b> occurs when the South Pacific High remains over the ocean and does not have a migratory high pressure system originating from the South Pacific High that moves east of the Andes (it builds over the Andes). Although this occurs throughout the year, during winters, it leads to cold temperatures while during summer, it leads to strong and deep convections. These convections are responsible for about 50% of summer precipitation south of 25oS.|$|E

These are the innermost lands and those {{at a higher}} elevation (cities included here are, amongst others, Alcoy, Morella, Requena and Villena). Here winters are cool to cold, especially at night (a few days of snow are not unusual), summers mild to hot and rainfall more evenly distributed through the year. The lower registered temperatures in the Valencian Community were in these inland areas during the <b>cold</b> <b>wave</b> of 1956. Temperatures plunged to nearly −20°C; as in Vistabella del Maestrat (−19°C) and Castellfort (–17°C).|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with such}} a drastic social experiment, and stunned by its arrest once the President dies, humans are faced with {{complete}} annihilation, as the <b>cold</b> <b>wave</b> progresses down toward the ocean floor. Scientists have to acknowledge yet another threat: that of biological devolution, turning men and women into oversized mollusks. Decision-makers are incapable of finding a global solution, but coalesce into competing factions. Two engineers personify that trend: Whitt suggests moving civilization closer to the inner molten regions; Xavier, inventor of nuclear propulsion, wants spacecraft to resettle humans on another planet. While Whitt and his secretary dig into the seafloor, Xavier and his concubine Olivia (collectively dubbed X-O) make a solitary escape into the cosmos.|$|E
25|$|Winters bring {{freezing}} temperatures, {{but usually}} move above freezing during the day's warmest point. The average January high is 38; the average January low is 22°F, {{but it is}} not unusual for winter temperatures to be much lower or higher than the averages. The all-time record low (not including wind chill) was −21°F during a widespread <b>cold</b> <b>wave</b> in January 1994. Snow is common in some winters, but the harsher winter conditions experienced to the north and west are not typical of Greater Reading. Annual snowfall is variable, but averages around 32inches. Spring temperatures vary widely between freezing temperatures and the 80s or even 90s later in Spring. The last killing frost usually is in later April, but freezing temperatures have occurred in May. Total precipitation for the entire year is around 45inches (112cm).|$|E

40|$|Extreme <b>cold</b> {{and heat}} <b>waves,</b> characterised {{by a number}} of cold or hot days in succession, place a strain on people’s {{cardiovascular}} and respiratory systems. The increase in deaths due to these waves may be greater than that predicted by extreme temperatures alone. We examined <b>cold</b> and heat <b>waves</b> in 99 US cities for 14 years (1987 – 2000) and investigated how the risk of death depended on the temperature threshold used to define a wave, and a wave’s timing, duration and intensity. We defined <b>cold</b> and heat <b>waves</b> using temperatures above and below cold and heat thresholds for two or more days. We tried five cold thresholds using the first to fifth percentiles of temperature, and five heat thresholds using the ninety-fifth to ninety-ninth percentiles. The extra wave effects were estimated using a two-stage model to ensure that their effects were estimated after removing the general effects of temperature. The increases in deaths associated with <b>cold</b> <b>waves</b> were generally small and not statistically significant, and there was even evidence of a decreased risk during the <b>coldest</b> <b>waves.</b> Heat waves generally increased the risk of death, particularly for the hottest heat threshold. <b>Cold</b> <b>waves</b> of a <b>colder</b> intensity or longer duration were not more dangerous. <b>Cold</b> <b>waves</b> earlier in the cool season were more dangerous, as were heat waves earlier in the warm season. In general there was no increased risk of death during <b>cold</b> <b>waves</b> above the known increased risk associated with cold temperatures. <b>Cold</b> or heat <b>waves</b> earlier in the cool or warm season may be more dangerous because of a build up in the susceptible pool or a lack of preparedness for cold or hot temperatures...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{there has been}} an {{increase}} in magnitude and occurrence of heat waves and a decrease of <b>cold</b> <b>waves,</b> both of which {{may be related to the}} anthropogenic influence. This study describes the extreme temperature regime of heat <b>waves</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>waves</b> across South America over recent years (1980 – 2014). Temperature records come from the Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD), a climatological data set produced by the National Climatic Data Center that provides records of daily maximum and minimum temperatures acquired worldwide. The magnitude of heat <b>waves</b> and <b>cold</b> <b>waves</b> for each GSOD station are quantified on an annual basis by means of the Heat Wave Magnitude Index and the ColdWave Magnitude Index. Results indicate an increase in intensity and in frequency of heat waves, especially in the last 10 years.
