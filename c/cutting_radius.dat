40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} avoid the {{stochastic}} damage of micro cleavage on cutting edge, a brittle-ductile transition lapping mechanism is proposed for the mechanical lapping of single crystal diamond cutting tools to direct the tools lapping. As expected, the critical depths of cut for brittle-ductile transition in different orientations and on different crystal planes are calculated. According to the theoretical results, the actual dynamic depth of cut is controlled within the critical depth of cut, which ensures that the tool lapping is carried out in ductile regime and the changes of <b>cutting</b> edge <b>radius</b> characterize with some specific time laws in lapping. Therefore, the time series and nonlinear least square methods are used to analyze the changing laws of <b>cutting</b> edge <b>radius.</b> As a result, a coupled model to build a bridge between the <b>cutting</b> edge <b>radius</b> changes and lapping time is developed. In terms of this developed model, a required <b>cutting</b> edge <b>radius</b> restricts a tool’s lapping time.

40|$|Ultra-precision diamond {{machining}} (UPDM) {{is widely}} used to manufacture high quality surface within sub-micrometric form error and nanometric surface roughness due to its high efficiency and low cost. However, in a complex UPDM process, many factors affect such sub-micrometric form error. Especially, spindle vibration produces a significant impact upon surface generation, not only influencing nanometric surface roughness, but also affecting sub-micrometric form error. In this study, a five-DOF dynamic model is established for spindle vibration in UPDM. The form error under spindle vibration is discussed with a surface generation model. The results show that (i) axial, radial, and coupled-tilting spindle vibration makes a great contribution to form error; (ii) the coupled-tilting frequencies are influenced by spindle speed; and (iii) the spindle vibration is reproduced at a machined surface to generate regular patterns consequently to cause form error, which is well identified {{with a focus on}} axial spindle vibration by face turning in UPDM.

For all these reasons, in manufacturing industry, a highly interest in analytical methods are usually researched because there are very practice to use but those methods don’t take into account all the aspects of the contact between the work material and the tool.

Several different methods of assessing the wear modes and mechanisms are evaluated; Cutting and thrust force components, Set width, Kerf width, “Out-of-square ” cutting, Wear modes and mechanisms and Chip characteristics. The wear mode established in the current work when bandsawing austenitic stainless steel with a bimetal blade is flank and corner wear together with formation of a <b>cutting</b> edge <b>radius.</b> The <b>cutting</b> edge <b>radius</b> increases as the wear progresses, reaching 25 - 50 mm after 300 cut sections.

As the wear reaches steady-state the mechanism is adhesive wear of the flank surface with tempering/softening of high-speed steel layers. When the wear reached the steady-state region the level of thrust and cutting force were equal and relatively high. The kerf width appears to be less than the total set width of the blade, meaning that there is compression of the set teeth as they pass through the kerf.

In an earlier publication [Goijaerts et al., J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., Trans. ASME 122 (2000) 476], two approaches were elaborated using local ductile fracture models. The first strategy incorporates the characterisation of a ductile fracture model in a blanking experiment. The second methodology is more favourable for industry. In this approach, instead of a complex and elaborate blanking experiment, a tensile test is used to characterise a newly proposed criterion, which was shown to predict accurately the ductile fracture for different loading conditions. In this paper, finite element simulations and experiments are performed on both tensile testing and blanking to evaluate the validity of both approaches with corresponding criteria for five different metals. In the blanking process, different clearances as well as different <b>cutting</b> <b>radii</b> of the tools are considered. In conclusion, it can be stated that the first approach gives very good results close to, or within the experimental error for all five materials.
