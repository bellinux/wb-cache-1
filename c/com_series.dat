40|$|Fantasy {{literature}} in the 1980 s underwent a revisionist change, {{which resulted in the}} emergence of a number of subgenres that challenged the dominant Tolkien model of fantasy writing. One such subgenre, which continues in popularity today, is urban fantasy (UF). UF is distinguished by real-world urban settings unsettled by the presence of the supernatural and the non-rational. The exemplary writers in this genre are Emma Bull (War for the Oaks, 1987), China Mieville (King Rat, 1998) as well as Laurell K. Hamilton (in her prolific series: Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter), Patricia Briggs (Mercy Thompson Series) and Suzanne McLeod (Spellcrackers. <b>com</b> <b>Series),</b> among others. The classification of UF has predominantly been commercial or industry-based, with little critical or theoretical evaluation undertaken to define or establish its parameters. Within a limited frame of reference this thesis aims to fulfil a twofold purpose: first, to explore the evolution of UF from its roots in fantasy, urban realism and other antecedent genres so as to better establish its inherited characteristics; and, second, to offer a classificatory framework that identifies the distinctive elements of UF’s thematic concerns and protagonists. An exploration of UF highlights that it is a unique subgenre that comments on our inherent fears and anxieties of contemporary urban life. Furthermore, UF draws attention to culture’s disturbing fascination with the brutal, monstrous, facets of human life and, as a femalecentric subgenre, challenges us to rethink our received perceptions of the female hero...|$|E

The COP and <b>COM</b> time <b>series</b> have been determined using an experimental setup with a force plate and a 3 D kinematic system on six healthy young adult subjects during four different 30 s standing tasks: (a) quiet standing; (b) one leg standing; (c) voluntary oscillation about the ankles and (d) voluntary oscillation about the ankles and hips. To test the difference between the COM trajectories, the root mean square (RMS) differences between each method (three comparisons) were calculated. The RMS differences between kinematic–LPF and GLP–LPF are significantly larger than kinematic–GLP. Our results show that the GLP method is comparable to the kinematic method. Both agree with the unified theory of balance during upright stance. The GLP method is attractive in the clinical perspective because it requires only a force plate to determine the COP–COM variable, which has been demonstrated to have a high reliability. r 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Defesa: Curitiba, 01 / 12 / 2014 Inclui referências : f. 79 - 83 Área de concentração:Recursos HídricosResumo: Na teoria de valores extremos, a análise de máximos sempre atrai mais atenção do que a de mínimos. Ainda há muitos detalhes a serem descobertos e esclarecidos para mínimos em relação às propriedades das funções de distribuições de probabilidade. O reconhecimento crescente da importância das vazões mínimas para a viabilidade de ecossistemas, para a sustentabilidade da economia e como sentinela das mudanças climáticas, faz com que o estudo de extremos mínimos torne-se cada vez mais importante. O objetivo desta dissertação é compensar em parte a falta de tratamento teórico sobre extremos mínimos e, especificamente, vazões mínimas. O método está dividido em duas abordagens: a análise convencional e a análise assintótica. Na análise convencional foram ajustadas as distribuições de Weibull e Lognormal de dois parâmetros às séries de vazões mínimas anuais e mínimas médias móveis de 7 dias de duração. Em seguida, foram aplicados os testes de aderência Qui-Quadrado e Kolmogorov-Smirnov. O estudo da abordagem da análise assintótica foi baseado no artigo de Gottschalk et al., 2013, e nesta pesquisa é dada ênfase ao Método do Bloco (BM). Duas distribuições "mãe", aqui entendidas como as distribuições de todas as vazões médias diárias, com comportamento de potência para vazões mínimas, são investigadas: i) Distribuição Gama; ii) Distribuição Lognormal de dois parâmetros. Busca-se demonstrar que essas distribuições pertencem ao domínio mínimo de atração da distribuição de Weibull, isto é, amostras de mínimos dessas duas distribuições, assintoticamente tenderão à distribuição de Weibull. A teoria estudada nesta dissertação é aplicada a 11 estações fluviométricas da bacia hidrográfica do rio Iguaçu <b>com</b> <b>séries</b> de dados de 48 anos. A partir da análise convencional, conclui-se que a distribuição Lognormal foi a que apresentou melhor ajuste segundo o teste ?? 2, na quase totalidade das estações. Porém, para a maioria das estações, a distribuição de Weibull também obteve um bom ajuste com o mesmo teste de aderência. Verificouse que a distribuição Gama, com relação aos mínimos, tende a uma função de potência em consequência da distribuição de Weibull, e a Lognormal não apresenta bom ajuste para 3 das estações da bacia do rio Iguaçu. Isto não foi suficiente para rejeitar a distribuição Lognormal como uma boa candidata para modelar vazões mínimas, devido à análise dos parâmetros. Observou-se que a assimetria das séries de vazões médias diárias das estações da bacia do rio Iguaçu é maior do que a assimetria da distribuição de Weibull, e tem bom ajuste à distribuição Lognormal. Os parâmetros ??, ?? e ????, das séries de vazões mínimas anuais moduladas, se ajustaram bem à distribuição Lognormal. Em conformidade com os estudos da análise convencional prefere-se indicar a LN 2 do que a W 2 para estudos de vazões mínimas na bacia hidrográfica do rio Iguaçu. Abstract: In {{extreme value}} theory {{analysis}} maximums, always attracts {{more attention than}} the minimums. There are still many details to be discovered and clarified to minimums {{in relation to the}} properties of distribution functions. The growing recognition of the importance of minimum flows for the viability of ecosystems, sustainability of the economy and as a sentinel of climate change, makes the minimum extremes study become increasingly important. The aim of this work is to offset in part the lack of theoretical treatment of extreme minimum and specifically minimum flows. The method has two approaches, the conventional analysis and the asymptotic analysis. In conventional analysis were adjusted the Weibull and Lognormal 2 parameters distributions to the series of annual minimum flows and minimum averages of 7 days. Then were applied the tests Qui-Square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov. The study of the asymptotic analysis was based on the paper of Gottschalk et al., 2013 and this research emphasis is given to the block method (BM). Two parent distributions here understood as the distributions of all average daily flow rates with power behavior for low flows are investigated: i) Gamma distribution; ii) Lognormal distribution. The aim is to demonstrate that these distributions belong to a minimum domain of attraction of the Weibull distribution, that is, minimal samples of these two distributions asymptotically tend to Weibull distribution. The theory studied in this thesis is applied to 11 gauged stations of the Iguaçu river basin with 48 -year data series. From the conventional analysis it is concluded that the Lognormal distribution presents the best fit according to the ?? 2 test. However, for most stations Weibull distribution has also achieved a good fit with the same test. It was found that the Gamma distribution with respect to the minimum tends to a power function {{as a result of the}} Weibull distribution and the Lognormal presents no good fit for three stations of the Iguaçu River basin. This was not enough to reject the Lognormal distribution as a good candidate to model minimum flows, because of the parameters analysis. It was observed that the asymmetry of the average daily flow of the Iguaçu River basin gauged stations series is higher than the asymmetry of the Weibull distribution, and has good fit to Lognormal distribution. The parameters ??, ?? and ????, of the annual minimum flows modulated series, had goof fit to the Lognormal distribution. In accordance with the studies of conventional analysis is preferred to indicate the LN 2 than W 2 for studies of minimum flows in the catchment area of the Iguaçu River.

This will test whether these flows cause instability for those markets and increase their exposure to international stock market returns. A proprietary database, from Emerging Portoflio. <b>com</b> and time <b>series</b> models, both univariate (ARCH - GARCH) and multivariate (VAR), are used to estimate the effect foreign portfolio flows on the risk variables and the causality of these effects. We found no strong {{evidence to support the}} hypothesis that foreign flows cause instability in the Latin American stock markets, in spite of some evidence of causing price pressure. Instead, the evidence points to a strong dependence of market returns on international stock and foreign exchange markets, both in means and in volatility, instrumental to transmit crisis to those markets...|$|R
40|$|DC Comics's Fables is {{a postmodern}} pop culture {{pastiche}} which involves both the extraordinary vision of fairytales and a carnivalesque counter-cultural subversion of Disney-inflected norms. Accordingly, this paper explores {{the ways in}} which Fables's narratives and semiotics reveal everyday life to be a construct normalised by its subjects. Issues such as intertextual dialogue, carnival, active audiences, and the neo-Victorian prosocial diadecism of the fairytale genre are discussed. Fables is an ongoing comic book series published by DC Comics's mature-audience-targeted Vertigo imprint. It has proven popular enough to warrant a spin-off companion series, a prestige-bound hardcover collection, and a script order for a television pilot (Futoncritic. <b>com</b> np). The <b>series</b> is written under two central conceits: that public domain fairytale heroes and villains—such as Snow White, The Big Bad Wolf, Baba Yaga, Sinbad, and Prince Charming— all exist in a shared narrative continuity, and that they live in present-day New York, having been driven from their homelands by the evil Adversary. It thus subverts the traditional fairytale structure where the hero(ine) is plucked from a comforting domesticity, and called to adventur...|$|R
