5|$|A <b>computer</b> <b>can</b> {{act as one}} or {{all three}} of these {{components}} at the same time. The Xgrid protocol provides the basic infrastructure for computers to communicate, but is not involved in the processing of the specified calculation. Xgrid is targeted towards time consuming computations that can be easily segregated into smaller tasks, sometimes called embarrassingly parallel tasks. This includes Monte Carlo calculations, 3D rendering and Mandelbrot maps.|$|E
5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a <b>computer</b> <b>can</b> both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E
5|$|Privacy Control can warn users when sending {{confidential}} information. It {{can also}} be configured to block the transmission. It allows users to specify how the information can sent, such as via IM or e-mail. Item-specific exceptions allow users to control where there data can be sent. However, PC Pro found a flaw in the information filtering feature. The way information is formatted {{on the list of}} confidential information can affect its effectiveness. For example, entering the last six digits of a credit card number will not stop the numbers from leaking if they are grouped in four digits. PC Magazine also noted the fact anyone who can login to the <b>computer</b> <b>can</b> view the database of private information. For that reason, Symantec recommends entering only the last portion of sensitive information.|$|E

25|$|A {{computer}} program is usually {{written by a}} {{computer program}}mer in a programming language.

25|$|The {{fundamental}} difference between a calculator and computer is that a <b>computer</b> <b>can</b> be programmed {{in a way that}} allows the program to take different branches according to intermediate results, while calculators are pre-designed with specific functions (such as addition, multiplication, and logarithms) built in. The distinction is not clear-cut: some devices classed as programmable calculators have programming functions, sometimes with support for programming languages (such as RPL or TI-BASIC).|$|E

25|$|Correctly calculating bonus pins can be difficult, {{especially}} when combinations of strikes and spares come in successive frames. In modern times, however, {{this has been}} overcome with automated scoring systems, linked to the pinsetters that set and clear the pins between frames. A computer automatically counts pins that remain standing, and fills in a virtual score sheet (usually displayed on monitors above each lane). However, even the automated system is not fool-proof, as the <b>computer</b> <b>can</b> miscount the number of pins that remain standing.|$|E
25|$|Psychology has {{demonstrated}} that {{being a part of}} a team has a direct influence on attitude and behavior of team members. Members of a team think they are more similar to each other than people on the outside. There are two main characteristics that define team interactions – identity and interdependence. For a group to become a team the members must identify with each other and exhibit some degree of interdependence on each other. These two characteristics were tested to determine if a <b>computer</b> <b>can</b> be a teammate.|$|E

25|$|All the {{electromagnetic}} motors, {{and that includes}} the types mentioned here derive the torque from the vector product of the interacting fields. For calculating the torque it is necessary to know the fields in the air gap. Once these have been established by mathematical analysis using FEA or other tools the torque may be calculated as the integral of all the vectors of force multiplied by the radius of each vector. The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current. This makes the calculation difficult but a <b>computer</b> <b>can</b> do the many calculations needed.|$|E
