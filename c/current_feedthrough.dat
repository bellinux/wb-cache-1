40|$|In the National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS), the {{following}} three research items are being advanced as application of high temperature superconductor (HTS) to an experimental fusion plasma system, through collaboration with universities and laboratories. The first is an application of HTS in the large <b>current</b> <b>feedthrough</b> to a superconducting coil cooled with superfluid helium in order to reconcile low heat load and stable large current transport capability. A 20 kA <b>current</b> <b>feedthrough</b> from 4. 4 K to 1. 8 K has been being developed using YBCO bulk superconductors manufactured by the QMG process. The second {{is the development of}} a 30 kA HTS current lead. The Bi 2212 bulk material fabricated by the diffusion process is considered as a candidate material for HTS current leads. The third is the development of the superconducting magnetic-levitation coil for Mini-RT wound with Bi 2223 tape conductor. A magnetic-levitation coil operated in persistent-current mode has to levitate for 8 hours without a feed of refrigerant. Present status of these HTS application researches in NIFS is reported...|$|E
40|$|Important {{technological}} {{advances in the}} last decades paved {{the road to a}} great success story for electrically stimulating medical implants, including cochlear implants or implants for deep brain stimulation. However, there are still many challenges in reducing side effects and improving functionality and comfort for the patient. Two of the main challenges are the wish for smaller implants on one hand, and the demand for more stimulation channels on the other hand. But these two aims lead to a conflict of interests. This paper presents a novel design for an electrical feedthrough, the so called capacitive feedthrough, which allows both reducing the size, and increasing the number of included channels. Capacitive feedthroughs combine the functionality of a coupling capacitor and an electrical feedthrough within one and the same structure. The paper also discusses the progress and the challenges of the first produced demonstrators. The concept bears a high potential in improving <b>current</b> <b>feedthrough</b> technology, and could be applied on all kinds of electrical medical implants, even if its implementation might be challenging...|$|E

40|$|We adopt thick-film {{technology}} to produce ultra high vacuum compatible interfaces for electrical signals. These interfaces permit voltages {{of hundreds of}} Volts and currents of several Amperes and allow for very compact vacuum setups, useful in quantum optics in general, and especially for quantum information and quantum simulations using miniaturized traps for ions or neutral atoms. Such printed circuits can also be useful as pure in-vacuum devices. We demonstrate a specific interface, which provides eleven <b>current</b> <b>feedthroughs,</b> more than 70 dc feedthroughs and a feedthrough for radio frequencies. We achieve a pressure in the low 1 e- 11 mbar range and demonstrate the full functionality of the interface by trapping chains of cold ytterbium ions, which requires all of the signals mentioned above being present. In addition, a versatile multi-channel device for supplying precise time-dependent voltages has been developed.

40|$|The lattice of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) {{contains}} 364 Short Straight Section (SSS) units, one {{in every}} 53 m long half-cell. An SSS consists of three major assemblies: the standard cryostat section, the cryogenic service module, and the jumper connection. The standard cryostat section of an SSS contains the twin aperture high-gradient superconducting quadrupole and two pairs of superconducting corrector magnets, operating in pressurized helium II at 1. 9 K. Components for isolating cryostat insulation vacuum, and the cryogenic supply lines, have to be foreseen. Special emphasis {{is given to the}} design changes of the SSS following adoption of an external cryogenic supply line (QRL). A jumper connection connects the SSS to the QRL, linking all the cryogenic tubes necessary for the local full-cell cooling loop [at every second SSS]. The jumper is connected to one end of the standard cryostat section via the cryogenic service module, which also houses beam diagnostics, <b>current</b> <b>feedthroughs,</b> and instrumentation capillaries. The conceptual design fulfilling the tight requirements of magnet alignment precision and cryogenic performance are described.

40|$|The {{electrical}} circuit of the HERA p-ring is divided in octants whereby {{in the case}} of a quench the current has to be commutated to dumping resistors. A straightforward method would be to use a conventional switching device and stationary loaded <b>current</b> <b>feedthroughs.</b> This approach results in a notable helium consumption of at least 150 L/hr due to the continuous energy loss in the large number of high current leads. An alternative is to apply superconducting switches which enables to keep the main circuit at 4 K while during a quench the current is forced to flow through instantaneously loaded leads and the dumping resistors. The main specifications of the required switches are: current of 6. 5 kA, minimum off-resistarice 12 R, energy absorbed 1 MJ and self protecting. In this paper the various design and feasibility aspects df superconducting switches for this application are discussed. It appeared that the requirement of being passively protected against a self-quench is the most critical one.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} design and {{enhanced}} electrical transduction of a bulk acoustic mode resonator fabricated in a commercial foundry MEMS process utilizing 2. 5 ?m gaps. The I–V characteristics of electrically addressed silicon resonators are often dominated by capacitive parasitics, inherent to hybrid technologies. This paper benchmarks a variety of drive and detection principles for electrostatically driven square-extensional mode resonators operating in air via analytical models accompanied by measurements of fabricated devices with the primary aim of enhancing {{the ratio of the}} motional to <b>feedthrough</b> <b>current</b> at nominal operating voltages. In view of ultimately enhancing the motional to <b>feedthrough</b> <b>current</b> ratio, a new detection technique that combines second harmonic capacitive actuation and piezoresistive detection is presented herein. This new method is shown to outperform previously reported methods utilizing voltages as low as ± 3 V in air, providing a promising solution for low voltage CMOS-MEMS integration.

40|$|As {{high-temperature}} superconductor technology approaches commercial applications, {{for example}} superconducting magnetic energy storage, superconducting fault current limiters, and superconducting rotary machines for marine propulsion, it is timely {{to consider the}} possibility of integrating the associated control equipment into the cryostat with the superconductor. This may bring benefits in terms of the performance of the power electronics or may enable other system benefits such as higher voltage lower <b>current</b> <b>feedthroughs</b> which reduce heat leakage into the cryostat. This Thesis studies the performance of several DC-DC power conversion techniques at temperatures down to 20 K. In particular hard switching, synchronous rectifier, zero-voltageswitching and multi-level circuit prototypes are examined, focusing on the losses in the semiconductor devices. The prototypes operated from 120 V and 500 V DC supplies at power levels up to 500 W using MOSFET devices and ultrafast, Schottky and silicon carbide diodes. The semiconductors were all in commercial TO 220 packages. Although MOSFET on-state resistance was found to drop by a factor of approximately six at cryogenic temperatures, the device switching speed and switching losses were relatively insensitive to temperature. The diode on-state voltage increased by 20 - 30 % at low temperatures whilst reverse recovery and the associated losses decreased by a factor of up to ten. The total semiconductor losses in all prototypes reduced at low temperatures, typically exhibiting a minimum value in the region of 50 - 100 K. The performance of the hard switching and synchronous rectifier circuits was limited at cryogenic temperatures by switching losses, even though the dead time in the synchronous rectifier was adjusted to compensate for the increase in MOSFET gate threshold voltage at low temperatures. The zero-voltage-switching prototype offered the largest reduction in semiconductor losses at low temperatures, the losses were reduced to 18 % of the room temperature value. Furthermore, since the remaining losses were almost entirely due to MOSFET conduction, further reductions could be easily achieved by paralleling additional devices. The performance of the multi-level circuits was limited by switching losses and the large number of series connected devices; however, a zero-voltage-switching synchronous rectifier variant of the circuit was suggested to overcome some of these limitations.

40|$|Due to {{advances}} in the W 7 -X prototype coil development it seems to become possible to increase the cable diameter from 10 mm - as so far assumed to be the upper limit - to about 11 mm. It was shown already in a previous report that such a small diameter increase of only 10 % results, at least theoretically, in dramatical improvements of the conductor stability. In this work an attempt is made to optimize such an improved W 7 -X conductor with respect to thermohydraulic considerations, to stability and to quench behaviour {{in case of an}} emergency discharge of the W 7 -X coil system. Keeping the cable diameter constant at 11 mm and assuming the same NbTi and copper properties as with the existing 10 mm cable prototype, the variable design parameters are the number of the multifilamentary strands, the cable void fraction (the strand diameter depends on these variables) and the copper to superconductor ratio. The thermohydraulic and stability optimizations are performed for two steady state thermal loss cases of 4 mW and 10 mW per meter cable length. The results are optimum He mass flow rates of 0. 85 g/s and 1. 25 g/s, respectively, and for all loss cases a copper to superconductor ratio of around 3. Additionally, the void fraction 38 % and strand number 192 of the existing prototype cable seem to be good compromises for the strengthened cable too. Such a conductor would reach stability margins of about 85 mJ/cm" 3 and 60 mJ/cm" 3 for steady state losses of 4 mW/m and 10 mW/m, respectively. These margins surpass the measured total possible friction energy release of about 50 mJ/cm" 3 within one load cycle and would thus comply with an earlier stated stability criterion. Investigations into the quench behaviour of the strengthened cable show only a small dependence on the Cu/NbTi-ratio, so a value of about three is a good choice also in this respect. Assuming the worst case conditions of zero quench growth results in quench detection plus switch activation time requirements of about 330 ms for maximal discharge voltages of #<=# 10 kV between the <b>current</b> <b>feedthroughs.</b> The corresponding voltage maximum across one coil is around 1000 V.

40|$|The Plasma Science Experiment (PLS) on the Voyager {{spacecraft}} provide data on {{the plasma}} ions and electrons in the interplanetary medium and the magnetospheres of the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn. A description of the analysis used to obtain electron parameters (density, temperature, etc.) from the plasma science experiment PLS electron measurements which cover the energy range from 10 eV to 5950 eV is presented. The electron sensor (D cup) and its transmission characteristics are described. A derivation of the fundamental analytical expression of the reduced distribution function F(e) is given.

40|$|A {{very large}} number of magnets, both superconducting and {{conventional}} copper conductor magnets, are installed in the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) for the guidance of the two proton beams around the circumference. In total, the LHC counts 1614 different electrical circuits with 1712 power converters for DC powering of the superconducting and normal conducting magnets. Besides the electrical circuits connecting main magnets for bending and focusing of the two counter-rotating beams, the demanding requirements {{on the quality of the}} magnetic fields require a large number of circuits for corrector magnets distributed around the circumference. In total, more than 10000 magnets will need to be connected to the power converters via a large inventory of electrical components such as normal conducting cables and tubes, energy extraction systems, <b>current</b> <b>feedthroughs</b> and superconducting busbars. Depending on the complexity and importance of these electrical circuits and their components, various systems will interact for their powering and protection. For example the stored energy in each of the main dipole circuits amounts to 1. 2 GJ and requires strict but intelligent protection measures to avoid damage to valuable accelerator equipment. Due to the unprecedented complexity of the LHC powering system the equipment protection demands a coherent description of the circuits within the LHC Reference Database. This description, which forms a vital basis of the present thesis, will provide reliable and important information to various clients. Generating input files for optics programs such as MAD automatically from the database will support the design and optimization process of the accelerator. Later on, the installation process will be supported with data for the interconnections to be performed between the cryogenic assemblies in the LHC tunnel and data will also be used for quality assurance tests. Protection of the installed superconducting equipment is assured by the powering interlock controller, using newly developed, flexible and intelligent protection mechanisms. During commissioning and operation, the information in the database about the electrical installations is used by the interlock controllers to automatically configure its software that will be running in 36 different locations of the LHC tunnel. Depending on properties of the different electrical circuits such as the stored magnetic energies, maximum current ratings, natural time constants and the importance for beam operation, advanced protection mechanisms are configurable and intertwine for the protection of equipment. This is possible due to a flexible and modular approach for the hardware and software to be deployed for the powering interlock controller. Depending on the number of electrical circuits and their types, various developed hardware modules can be installed in the racks of the powering interlock controller, while a unique program will be configured according to the installed hardware...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the effort}} to {{increase}} the reliability of the MMT Observatory (MMTO) 6. 5 m Primary Mirror Coating System, the specified filament has changed from a configuration in which the aluminum charge is hand wound around a tungsten filament to a configuration in which the aluminum is integrally wound with the tungsten at the time of filament manufacture. In the MMTO configuration, this filament consists of the three strands of tungsten wire and one strand of aluminum wire. In preparation of a full system test utilizing two hundred filaments fired simultaneously, an extensive testing program was undertaken to characterize these filaments using a four filament configuration in the MMTO small coating chamber (0. 5 m) and then a forty filament configuration in the University of Arizona Steward Observatory coating chamber (2 m). The testing using the smaller coating chambers has shown these filaments provide very predicable coatings from test to test, and with the proper heating profile, these filaments greatly reduce the likelihood of aluminum drips. The initial filament design was modified during the course of testing by shortening the unwound filament length to closer match the aluminum load required in the MMTO coating chamber. This change increased the aluminum deposition rates without increasing the power delivered of the filament power supplies (commercial welders).
