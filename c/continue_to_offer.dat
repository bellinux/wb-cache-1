5|$|Readers of Aristotle {{have found}} the four causes that he uses in his {{biological}} explanations opaque, something not helped by many centuries of confused exegesis. For a biological system, these are however straightforward enough. The material cause is simply what a system is constructed from. The goal (final cause) and formal cause are what something is for, its function: to a modern biologist, such teleology describes adaptation {{under the pressure of}} natural selection. The efficient cause is how a system moves and develops: to a modern biologist, those are explained by developmental biology and physiology. Biologists <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> explanations of these same kinds.|$|E

25|$|In higher education, {{a college}} is {{normally}} a provider {{that does not}} hold university status, although it can also refer to a constituent part of a collegiate or federal university or a grouping of academic faculties or departments within a university.
