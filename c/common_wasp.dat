5|$|The term wasp is {{sometimes}} used more narrowly for the Vespidae, {{which includes the}} <b>common</b> <b>wasp</b> or yellow jacket genera Vespula and Dolichovespula and the hornets, Vespa; or simply for the <b>common</b> <b>wasp</b> and close lookalikes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>common</b> <b>wasp,</b> Vespula vulgaris, {{engages in}} worker policing, {{and it is}} known that a {{significant}} number of workers have active ovaries. However, studies by researchers have suggested that relatedness may not be the key factor in the development of worker policing. Rather, it is hypothesized that worker policing has been selected due to conflict suppression in the colony.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} German wasp and {{two species of}} Polistes (all {{invasive}} species), the <b>common</b> <b>wasp</b> is considered a pest species in New Zealand, as it competes with endemic species for food, such as insects and honeydew. In some South Island beech forests {{it is thought that}} densities of wasps are higher {{than anywhere else in the}} world. It is calculated that the total weight of common wasps in these places may exceed that of all birds.|$|E
50|$|These quite <b>common</b> <b>wasps</b> can {{be found}} in most of Europe and in North Africa (Algeria, Egypt). This species prefers warm, open and sandy areas.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Wasps are paraphyletic, {{consisting}} of the clade Apocrita without ants and bees, which are not usually considered to be wasps. The Hymenoptera also contain the somewhat wasplike Symphyta, the sawflies. The familiar <b>common</b> <b>wasps</b> and yellowjackets belong to one family, the Vespidae.|$|R
25|$|V. rufa can {{be found}} in the “Palearctic” and in the {{northern}} parts of North America. Examples of locations with V. rufa include England, Ireland, the Netherlands, Russia, Turkey, Mongolia, and China. In general, this species builds its nests below ground, often in cavities or along the underside of a roof. V. rufa nests are generally found underground near the surface of dry banks. Nests are made using mineral soil and leaf litter in a shaded environment. Old tree remains and tree roots can also be utilized to make nests. V. rufa is a <b>common</b> <b>wasp</b> species.|$|E
25|$|Only the wasps {{leaving the}} nest notice a {{disturbance}} and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones {{returning to the}} nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture – they rise onto the tips of their tarsi, put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly {{to the entrance of}} the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks. However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the Vespula vulgaris workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike bees which die after stinging, Vespula vulgaris can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the <b>common</b> <b>wasp</b> is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior.|$|E

25|$|D. arctica are {{not well}} known. These <b>common</b> <b>wasps</b> rely on new nests to rear {{offspring}} since {{they do not have}} their own worker caste.

2500|$|Vespula vulgaris, {{known as}} the <b>common</b> <b>wasp,</b> is a wasp found in various {{regions of the world}} {{including}} the United Kingdom, Germany, India, China, New Zealand, and Australia. It is sometimes {{known as the}} European wasp; the same name is used for the species Vespula germanica, which is also known as the German wasp. Another name for Vespula vulgaris is the [...] "common yellow-jacket". It was discovered in 2010 that wasps in North America thought to be Vespula vulgaris are actually a different species, Vespula alascensis.|$|E
2500|$|The name Vespula vulgaris {{comes from}} {{the origin of the}} word vulgaris, which means [...] "common" [...] in Latin, {{therefore}} giving the name, the <b>common</b> <b>wasp.</b> This species has many synonyms such as the [...] "common wasp", [...] "European wasp", Paravespula vulgaris, or the [...] "common yellow jacket". However, a study from 2010 revealed that Vespula vulgaris and the common yellow jacket are actually two different species, the latter known as Vespula alascensis. It is closely related to another wasp species, Vespula austriaca, and is considered a sister group.|$|E
2500|$|The eyes of V. crabro {{are deeply}} {{indented}} and {{shaped like a}} [...] "C". Its wings are reddish-orange, while the petiolate abdomen is striped with brown and yellow. It has hair on the thorax and abdomen, although the European hornet is not as hairy as most bees. Typical mass size for the European Hornet is 477.5+/-59.9mg. Due to this coloration and abdomen pattern, V. crabro is often mistaken for the Asian giant hornet. In size, the European hornet, at 25–35mm long, {{is larger than the}} <b>common</b> <b>wasp,</b> but smaller than the Asian giant hornet. Females are typically larger than males in both size and mass. However, male abdomens have seven segments, whereas female abdomens have six. Only females possess an ovipositor (modified to form a stinger), and males cannot sting. The antennae of males are slightly longer, with 13 segments compared to 12 segments in females.|$|E
40|$|Honey bee (Apis mellifera) guards {{recognise}} intruders {{primarily by}} odour. This study tested two competing hypotheses underlying {{the rejection of}} allospecific intruders: "different odour", whereby intruders are recognised by guards because their odours do not match those of honey bees in general, versus the "harmful intruder odour", whereby guards specifically recognise and reject intruders of harmful species. We presented eight species of harmless arthropod and three harmful insects (worker <b>common</b> <b>wasps,</b> Vespula vulgaris; adult wax moths, Galleria mellonella; and wood ants, Formica lugubris) to entrance guards. Guards rejected all but woodlice (Porcellio scaber) more than non-nestmate bees and at rates similar {{to or greater than}} <b>common</b> <b>wasps.</b> This is not as predicted by the harmful odour hypothesis, and thereby strengthens the different odour hypothesis. Woodlice were accepted at rates similar to non-nestmate bees, possibly because they have few cuticular hydrocarbons and may smell mainly of their environment...|$|R

25|$|Similarly {{to other}} Vespulas, Vespula vulgaris feed on animal preys such as {{caterpillars}} {{to feed their}} developing larvae and carbohydrates, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements. Their usual food sources are: wood pulp, freshly killed insects such as Hymenoptera, lepidopteran larvae and Diptera and Spiders. <b>Common</b> <b>wasps</b> will also attempt to invade honey bees' nests to steal their honey.|$|R
60|$|Charis melipona, a South American Longicorn of {{the family}} Necydalidæ, has been so named from its {{resemblance}} to a small bee of the genus Melipona. It {{is one of the}} most remarkable cases of mimicry, since the beetle has the thorax and body densely hairy like the bee, and the legs are tufted in a manner most unusual in the order Coleoptera. Another Longicorn, Odontocera odyneroides, has the abdomen banded with yellow, and constricted at the base, and is altogether so exactly like a small <b>common</b> <b>wasp</b> of the genus Odynerus, that Mr. Bates informs us he was afraid to take it out of his net with his fingers for fear of being stung. Had Mr. Bates's taste for insects been less omnivorous than it was, the beetle's disguise might have saved it from his pin, as it had no doubt often done from the beak of hungry birds. A larger insect, Sphecomorpha chalybea, is exactly like one of the large metallic blue wasps, and like them has the abdomen connected with the thorax by a pedicel, rendering the deception most complete and striking. Many Eastern species of Longicorns of the genus Oberea, when on the wing exactly resemble Tenthredinidæ, and many of the small species of Hesthesis run about on timber, and cannot be distinguished from ants. There is one genus of South American Longicorns that appears to mimic the shielded bugs of the genus Scutellera. The Gymnocerous capucinus is one of these, and is very like Pachyotris fabricii, one of the Scutelleridæ. The beautiful Gymnocerous dulcissimus is also very like the same group of insects, though there is no known species that exactly corresponds to it; but this is not to be wondered at, as the tropical Hemiptera have been comparatively so little cared for by collectors.|$|E
6000|$|It {{would appear}} that either the taste or the odour of the nectar of certain flowers is unattractive to hive or to humble-bees, or to both; for there seems no other reason why certain open flowers which secrete nectar are not visited by them. The small {{quantity}} of nectar secreted by some of these flowers can hardly {{be the cause of}} their neglect, as hive-bees search eagerly for the minute drops on the glands on the leaves of the Prunus laurocerasus. Even the bees from different hives sometimes visit different kinds of flowers, as {{is said to be the}} case by Mr. Grant with respect to the Polyanthus and Viola tricolor. (11/9. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1844 page 374.) I have known humble-bees to visit the flowers of Lobelia fulgens in one garden and not in another at the distance of only a few miles. The cupful of nectar in the labellum of Epipactis latifolia is never touched by hive- or humble-bees, although I have seen them flying close by; and yet the nectar has a pleasant taste to us, and is habitually consumed by the <b>common</b> <b>wasp.</b> As far as I have seen, wasps seek for nectar in this country only from the flowers of this Epipactis, Scrophularia aquatica, Symphoricarpus racemosa (11/10. The same fact apparently holds good in Italy, for Delpino says that the flowers of these three plants are alone visited by wasps: 'Nettarii Estranuziali, Bulletino Entomologico' anno 6.), and Tritoma; the two former plants being endemic, and the two latter exotic. As wasps are so fond of sugar and of any sweet fluid, and as they do not disdain the minute drops on the glands of Prunus laurocerasus, it is a strange fact that they do not suck the nectar of many open flowers, which they could do without the aid of a proboscis. Hive-bees visit the flowers of the Symphoricarpus and Tritoma, and this makes it all the stranger that they do not visit the flowers of the Epipactis, or, as far as I have seen, those of the Scrophularia aquatica; although they do visit the flowers of Scrophularia nodosa, at least in North America. (11/11. 'Silliman's American Journal of Science' August 1871.) ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{second case}} of mimicry not yet noticed by any naturalist {{is seen in}} another grasshopper, also common in La Plata (Rhomalea speciosa of Thun-berg). This is an {{extremely}} elegant insect; the head and thorax chocolate, with cream-coloured markings; the abdomen steel-blue or purple, a colour I have not seen in any other insects of this family. The fore wings have a protective colouring; the hind wings are bright red. When at rest, with the red and purple tints concealed, {{it is only a}} very pretty grasshopper, but the instant it takes wing it becomes the fac-simile of a very <b>common</b> <b>wasp</b> of the genus Pepris. These wasps vary greatly in size, some being as large as the hornet; they are solitary, and feed on the honey of flowers and on fruit, and, besides being furnished with stings like other wasps--though their sting is nok so venomous as in other genera--they also, when angry, emit a most abominable odour, and are thus doubly protected against their enemies. Their excessive tameness, slow flight, and indolent motions serve to show that they are not accustomed to be interfered with. All these strong-smelling wasps have steel-blue or purple bodies, and bright red wings. So exactly does the Rhomalea grasshopper mimic the Pepris when flying, that I have been deceived scores of times. I have even seen it on the leaves, and, after it has flown and settled once more, I have gone to look at it again, to make sure that my eyes had not deceived me. It is curious to see how this resemblance has reacted on and modified the habits of the grasshopper. It is a great flyer, and far more aerial in its habits than any other insect I am acquainted with in this family, living always in trees, instead of on or near the surface of the ground. It is abundant in orchards and plantations round Buenos Ayres, where its long and peculiarly soft, breezy note may be heard all summer. If the ancient Athenians possessed so charming an insect as this, their great regard for the grasshopper was not strange: I only wish that the [...] "Athenians of South America," [...] as my fellow-townsmen sometimes call themselves in moments of exaltation, had a feeling of the samo kind--the regard which does not impale its object on a pin--for the pretty light-hearted songster of their groves and gardens.|$|E

50|$|Along {{with the}} German and <b>common</b> <b>wasps,</b> the Asian and Australian paper wasps (P. chinensis and P. humilis) are {{considered}} pests in New Zealand.

Because it competes with native species (such as the kākā) for insects, nectar, and honeydew, it is a hindrance to conservation efforts.|$|R
40|$|Hornets, {{the largest}} social wasps, have a {{reputation}} of being facultatively nocturnal. Here we confirm flight activity of hornet workers in dim twilight. We studied the eyes and ocelli of European hornets (Vespa crabro) and <b>common</b> <b>wasps</b> (Vespula vulgaris) with the goal to find the optical and anatomical adaptations {{that enable them to}} fly in dim light. Adaptations described for obligately nocturnal hymenoptera such as the bees Xylocopa tranquebarica and Megalopta genalis and the wasp Apoica pallens include large ocelli and compound eyes with wide rhabdoms and large facet lenses. Interestingly, we did not find any such adaptations in hornet eyes or ocelli. On the contrary, their eyes are even less sensitive than those of the obligately diurnal <b>common</b> <b>wasps.</b> Therefore we conclude that hornets, like several facultatively nocturnal bee species such as Apis mellifera adansonii, A. dorsata and X. tenuiscapa are capable of seeing in dim light simply due to the large body and thus eye size. We propose that neural pooling strategies and behavioural adaptations precede anatomical adaptations in the eyes and ocelli when insects with apposition compound eyes turn to dim light activity...|$|R

Williams identifies 15 subgenera that are seen to be monophyletic, fewer in number, diagnosable from morphology, and at least roughly correspond to behavioural and ecological groupings: Examples of Bombus species include Bombus atratus, Bombus dahlbomii, Bombus fervidus, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus ruderatus, and Bombus rupestris.|$|R
40|$|International audienceGuard {{honey bees}} patrol the {{entrance}} to the nest and are thought to recognise nestmates by cuticular hydrocarbons. We aimed to determine whether honey bee guards can recognise predatory <b>common</b> <b>wasps</b> Vespula vulgaris and nestmates by olfactory cues. Odours were transferred between both honey bees and wasps and the responses of guards to controlled introductions monitored. When controlling for the species of introduced insect, the transferred odour was a predictor of aggressive attacks on both bees and wasps. Carriers of incongruous, allospecific odours were antennated by more guards than carriers of conspecific odours. Olfactory cues were, therefore, transferred and guards responded not only to odour per se but also odour incongruity. Olfactory cues may therefore be important in predator recognition by honey bee guards...|$|R
