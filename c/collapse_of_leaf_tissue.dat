40|$|The {{growth rates}} of Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) larvae feeding on tomato plants constitutively expressing a prosystemin {{antisense}} gene were approximately 3 times higher than {{growth rates of}} larvae feeding on nontransformed control plants. The levels of proteinase inhibitor I and inhibitor II proteins in leaves of tomato plants expressing the antisense prosystemin gene remained at undetectable levels until the sixth day of larval feeding and then increased throughout the plants to 100 - 125 microg/g <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>tissue</b> after 14 days.

Low altitude exhibited more microflora than high altitude. The relationship between meteorological factors and type and number of the recovered microflora was investigated. Inoculation of detached healthy leaves of Juniperus procera by predominant fungal isolates revealed that only Alternaria alternata as a pathogen of this plant.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{framework}} of the investigations of electrical phenomena in plants, the DC resistance of plant tissues was studied. Objects of study were the leaves of monocot plant Zea mays indurata. The DC resistance of leaves is related almost exclusively to the continual system of apoplast. Effective resistance of apoplast measured along the midrib was found to be in inverse proportion to the width <b>of</b> a <b>leaf.</b> Taking into account the macroscopic structural anisotropy <b>of</b> a <b>leaf,</b> measurements <b>of</b> resistance were carried out in different directions with respect to the midrib. The degree of anisotropy of apoplast conductive system was found to be marked feebly. Local incisions <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>tissue</b> increase the resistance insufficiently due to bypass current routes. The resistance <b>of</b> a <b>leaf</b> was measured in the course of progressive water deficit. As the leaf is dried up, the DC resistance of its living part decreases, whereas the resistance of the “dead zone ” rises sharply. The observed decrease in resistance <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>tissue</b> in the course of water starvation seems unexpected. It may be caused by the entry of water and salts from vacuoles through membranes into apoplast...|$|R

40|$|Biologists {{have long}} been aware that adaptations should not be {{analysed}} in isolation from {{the function of the}} whole organism. Here, we address the equivalent issue at the scale of a social insect colony: the optimality of component behaviours in a partitioned sequence of tasks. In colonies of Atta colombica, a leaf-cutting ant, harvested <b>leaf</b> <b>tissue</b> is passed from foragers to nest workers that distribute, clean, shred and implant the tissue in fungal gardens. In four laboratory colonies of A. colombica, we found that the highest colony-wide rate <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>tissue</b> processing in the nest was achieved when leaf fragment sizes were suboptimal for individual delivery rate by foragers. Leaf-cutting ant colonies appear to compromise the efficiency <b>of</b> collecting <b>leaf</b> <b>tissue</b> in order to increase their ability to handle the material when it arrives in the nest.

The study led to the finding of relevant amounts of two closely related flavonoids, namely diosmin and hesperidin, which attract increasing interest for their biological properties. Anatomical investigations <b>of</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>tissue</b> showed the presence of needle-shaped crystals forming plumose clusters, mainly located close to, or within, vascular bundles.
