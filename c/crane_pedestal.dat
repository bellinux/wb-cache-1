40|$|Abstract. The jack-up {{wind turbine}} {{installation}} vessel {{is a special}} kind of vessel for building the offshore wind power farm. The main <b>crane</b> <b>pedestal,</b> which is the supporting structure of the crane on the main deck of the vessel, is always under high level loads when the ship is in operation condition. In this paper, the structural strength analysis of main <b>crane</b> <b>pedestal</b> of the jack-up wind turbine installation vessel was presented. The direct calculated method was used to evaluate the strength of the main <b>crane</b> <b>pedestal.</b> The FE model of main <b>crane</b> <b>pedestal</b> was established with refined mesh, and the adjoining hull structure was also modeled to provide accurate boundary condition. Considering the permanent loads, variable loads (crane loads) and wind loads on the pedestal, the load combinations were defined for the ultimate limit state for every 45 degree. The deformation and stress of the pedestal and the hull structures were calculated and checked. The results showed that all stress results were within the maximum allowable stresses. The critical areas are often located at the link region of hull and pedestal...|$|E
40|$|The Damen Crane Barge type CB 6324 is a {{transhipment}} barge, {{designed to}} operate in harbours, inshore and in near coastal waters worldwide, mainly for the on- and offloading of bulk carriers. In the second generation of this crane barge, optimization of the equipment and overall design is sought, increasing usability of the barge and reducing overall costs. The same is sought {{in the design of}} a jib rest, as it is found to be heavy and cost reduction can be realized by reducing weight. Additionally, it is suspected that the jib rest can be hit by the crane grab during operation. The new optimized design is restrained by the {{need to be able to}} withstand the load of the crane jib in travel conditions overseas and during its complete operational lifetime. As the barge needs to be able to operate worldwide, identification of Ultimate Limit Loads is key. Lloyds Register provides a conservative method to determine the loads acting on the floating crane barge and its equipment, based on extreme weather conditions. As specific data on the CB 6324 is available, a different calculation method is proposed, using motion responses, sea state data and design criteria as an input. The method is based on probability of encountering a sea state, the probability of non-exceedance of a wave in such a sea state, and the operability of the barge, to predict the maximum probable accelerations encountered. Finally, analysis of two first generation crane barges built, show some fatigue crack forming on the jib rests during transport to the operational locations. This signifies an interest of a fatigue analysis and estimation, adding up to three design objectives: A) Finding load cases using modeled motion responses and sea state probability B) Finding a new jib rest design that complies to the criteria set by Damen and with the load cases found with design objective A C) Finding an estimation on the fatigue lifetime on both the first and new generation jib rest For the determination of the accelerations, a tool is developed, which automates the calculations for the maximum expected loads in worldwide near shore operation and transport. The barge motion responses in regular waves are determined and used as the primary input. Secondary input is composed of wave data, direction and spreading. Wind speed, roll, pitch, flooding angles and (bending) stresses in the <b>crane</b> <b>pedestal</b> are used as additional criteria. As an output, it gives an overview of operability over the world, along with a selection of the maximum expected accelerations in the critical directions. Parallel to the load calculations and development of the tool, the design of the new jib rest is made. Starting with a concept and building up detail as more information is brought to light in every calculation step. The resulting design is composed of a 15 ton, hinged, steel A-frame with a weight reduction of approx. 5 ton compared to the first generation. Fatigue prediction shows a significant improvement on the fatigue lifetime, as a transport load case estimates the new design spending approx. 10 % of its fatigue lifetime. More weight reduction could be achieved by further research on whether the fr is a reasonable restriction for this barge. The stiffness of the jib rest is increased significantly to comply to this criterium in dropped down position. This weight reduction can only be realised if a less conservative load case calculation method is used, like the one proposed in this thesis.

5000|$|In 2006 Bluegrass {{created an}} {{underwater}} saw {{and had it}} patented for its use of hydraulic motors in combination with diamond wire {{to create a new}} sawing platform which was operational underwater. The continuous loop, four wheel drive diamond wire saw reduced cut times by providing greater torque and consistent wire grip. These improvements reduced slippage and subsequent wire breaks.Since then the patented underwater saw has been used domestically and globally on offshore decommissioning jobs including cutting single- and multi-string conductors, pipelines, seabed umbilicals, pilings, mooring chains, wellheads, risers, slot recovery and jacket lets. On platforms this technology can be applied to perform modifications, maintenance upgrades, to remove <b>crane</b> <b>pedestals,</b> compressors and topsides, and for hurricane remediation.Sub-sea saws can be installed by divers while being monitored and powered from a barge or platform, or they can be installed and powered by working class ROVs.The robust characteristics of these four wheel drive bespoke underwater wire saws, combined with remote control functionality, makes them suitable to extreme offshore decommissioning conditions such as the North Sea.|$|R
40|$|Offshore <b>pedestal</b> <b>cranes</b> are devices {{installed}} on offshore platforms or vessels. A characteri-stic feature of any floating object is the significant movement caused by sea waving.

5000|$|Outwardly, the New Orleans ships had a {{distinctive}} appearance and were considered very good-looking vessels, though the 1942-43 refits {{of the surviving}} ships changed the appearance substantially. The forward superstructure had the bridge wings cut back, {{and all of the}} large size windows were plated in with just a few port holes taking their place. The open bridge above the wheel house was enlarged by 100 percent by extending it forward. In addition several gun tubs were created for the 40 mm Bofors mounts both around the main mast, and aft. The forecastle deck extended back to the second funnel and the main superstructure was constructed without the ungainly tripod mast seen on the previous cruisers. The bow was a raked type, similar to those of British cruisers. The two funnels were situated closer together with a large search light tower in between. Aircraft handling facilities were moved further aft and a larger second conning station erected above the hangar. A single mainmast was erected there, between two huge <b>pedestal</b> <b>cranes</b> which handled both spotter planes and small craft. The main 8-inch turrets, although armored, were actually smaller with a more effective angular faceplate. By enlarging the forecastle deck, the secondary battery of 5-inch guns were mounted closer together, facilitating a more efficient ammunition delivery. Power was provided by eight Babcock & Wilcox high-pressure steam boilers that produced [...] for the four Westinghouse gearing steam turbines. The turbines were shafted to four screws, giving this class a rated speed of 33 kn. The cruisers' range - using 3269 LT of bunker oil - was approximately 14000 nmi km at 10 kn or 5280 nmi km at 20 kn. Their range could be extended by refueling from a tanker or another ship fitted to transfer oil while underway. The New Orleans cruisers performed peacetime exercises well with no serious shortcomings being found. While many changes were implemented to improve their performance and especially their protection, the 10,000-ton limit of the Washington Naval Treaty was not exceeded. The new cruisers were considered successful in their own right but could not be considered equal to some foreign contemporaries, which were often considerably larger.|$|R
40|$|Recent legislation, LOLER, {{removed the}} {{compulsion}} of periodical proof testing of lifting equipment to ascertain its "fitness for purpose". It {{has become the}} responsibility of a competent person to assess equipment's fitness for purpose and ability for continued safe use. This thesis reviews the technologies available to the competent person to enable him/her {{to come to an}} informed decision regarding the condition of mechanical structures. It was identified that an optimal methodology would interrogate structural integrity whilst the equipment performed its intended function. Coupling a means of assessment with the equipment's operation allows the investigator to focus on only defective conditions that will limit the future operation. Such an approach of condition monitoring structural integrity as opposed to employing traditional methods of inspection that are essentially failure finding tasks permits the discrimination between benign and malignant defects. Restorative and replacement activities can therefore take place based upon the likelihood of equipment's functional failure. The supplementary monitoring of Acoustic Emission (AE), with the established industrial practice of proof testing, was considered to provide data to monitor structural integrity and provide the basis upon which a structure can be re-qualified for future service. The nature of failure of engineering materials was examined which identified failure modes such as corrosion, creep and fatigue resulted in a progressive degradation of a localised area. The AE is a proportion of energy released during such deterioration. Further it was determined that {{the rate at which the}} deterioration increased was non-linear. Within a laboratory environment wire ropes with seeded faults were subjected to a simulated life during which the qualitative and quantitative nature of the AE was investigated. It was found that the quantity of the emission generated during proof tests was indicative of the severity of the induced defect. This substantiated the claim that AE could be used to enhance the proof test and provide a means by which a condition assessment could be made at intervals throughout the life of a structure. A series of five case studies explored the use of AE on a variety of differing in-service mechanical structures, mostly lifting equipmept. The case studies were conducted on pad-eyes,link-plates, cranes, both Electrical Overhead Travelling (EOT) and <b>pedestal</b> <b>cranes</b> and finally, an underwater vehicle pressure hull. The approach of using the combination of AE with a proof test was verified in the cases of pad-eyes and EOT cranes. In the instance of link plates, simultaneous measurement of strain and AE during a load test demonstrated the ability of AE to detect localised yielding. During the destruction test of a <b>pedestal</b> <b>crane</b> boom section, various conventional methods of AE evaluation were utilised to investigate which would provide the most reliable condition indicator; it was found that Intensity Analysis generated the most effective trendable measurement. A study on a pressure hull with known fatigue cracks that were subjected to both static and dynamic testing whilst monitoring with AE was conducted. The fatigue cracks were sized pre and post the trial using Time of Flight Diffraction (ToFD). During the trial Alternating Current Potential Drop (ACPD) was used to detect any growth as it occurred. Such techniques were used to substantiate claims AE could detect a propagating defect. When the AE is viewed in conjunction with ACPD results and the measurements attained with the ToFD it was clear that all three techniques concluded that crack growth occurred at two sites. Finally the investigation returns to a laboratory to exarnine the robustness of the technique through the life of a mechanical structure. The objective being to identify if periodical measurement of AE taken during the course of the life of the structure would repetitively generate information pertaining to the identification of the flaw as well as the severity of the flaw as it initiates and propagates through to failure. A power law was fitted to the data acquired during the proof tests. The use of a power law was considered appropriate due to the previously identified non-linear nature of material failure. A Scanning Electron Microscope was used to visually examine the fracture surfaces. It was found that increasing increments between striations on the fracture surface illustrated the non-linear increase of crack extensions during fatigue and corroborated the appropriateness of fitting a power law to the proof test data. Such an investigation permitted the conclusion that the approach of fitting a power law to the discrete energies from sequential proof tests is an appropriate method of attaining a trendable condition indicator. The competent person could employ such a methodology for the purposes of attaining information upon which an informed decision can be made on the continued safe use of mechanical structures.
