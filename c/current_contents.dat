500|$|Oryzomys is a genus of semiaquatic rodents in {{the tribe}} Oryzomyini living in {{southern}} North America and far northern South America. It includes eight species, two of which—the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) of the United States and O.couesi of Mexico and Central America—are widespread; the six others have more restricted distributions. The species have had eventful taxonomic histories, and most species were {{at one time}} included in the marsh rice rat; [...] additional species may be recognized in the future. The name Oryzomys was established in 1857 by Spencer Fullerton Baird for the marsh rice rat and was soon applied to over a hundred species of American rodents. Subsequently, the genus gradually became more narrowly defined until its <b>current</b> <b>contents</b> were established in 2006, when ten new genera were established for species previously placed in Oryzomys.|$|E
2500|$|The Chu Ci, {{variously}} {{translated as}} Verses of Chu or Songs of Chu, is {{an anthology of}} Chinese poetry traditionally attributed mainly to Qu Yuan and Song Yu from the Warring States period (ended 221 BC), though {{about half of the}} poems seem to have been composed several centuries later, during the Han dynasty.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} Han era contributions to poetry is the compilation of the Chuci anthology of poetry, which preserves many poems attributed to Qu Yuan and Song Yu from the Warring States period (ended 221 BC), though about half of the poems seem to have been in fact composed during the Han Dynasty. The meaning of Chuci is something like [...] "The Material of Chu", referring to the ancient Land of Chu. The traditional version of the Chu Ci contains 17 major sections, anthologized with its <b>current</b> <b>contents</b> by Wang Yi, a 2nd-century AD librarian who served under Emperor Shun of Han, who appended his own verses derivative of the Chuci or [...] "sao" [...] style {{at the end of the}} collection, under the title of Nine Longings. The poems and pieces of the Chu Ci anthology vary in their formal poetic styles, including varying line metrics, varying use of exclamatory particles, the use or not of titles for individual pieces within a section, and the varying presence of the luan (or, envoi). Other Han period poets besides Wang Yi the librarian who are known or thought to be contributors of poems collected in the Chuci include the poet Wang Bao and the scholar Liu Xiang. Liu An, the Prince of Huainan, and his literary circle were involved with the Chuci material, but the attribution of authorship of any particular poems is uncertain.|$|E
