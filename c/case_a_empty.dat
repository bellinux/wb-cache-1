40|$|Semantic query {{simplification}} utilizes integrity constraints enforced in {{a database}} system {{for reducing the}} number of tuple variables and terms in a relational calculus query. To a large degree, this can be done by a system that is external to the DBMS. The paper advocates the application of database theory in such a system and describes a working prototype of an external semantic query simplifier implemented in Prolog. The system employs a graph-theoretic approach to integrate tableau techniques and algorithms for the syntactic simplification of queries containing inequality conditions. The use of integrity constraints is shown not only to improve efficiency but also to permit more meaningful error messages to be generated, particularly in the <b>case</b> of <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> query result.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} {{constraint}} equations of the Lovelock gravity theories. In the <b>case</b> of <b>an</b> <b>empty,</b> compact, conformally flat, time-symmetric, space-like manifold, we show that the hamiltonian constraint equation becomes a generalisation of the σ_k-Yamabe problem. That is to say, the prescription of a linear combination of the σ_k-curvatures of the manifold. We search solutions in a conformal class. Using the existing results on the σ_k-Yamabe problem, we describe some cases in which they can be extended to this new problem. This requires to study the concavity of some polynomial. We do it in two ways: regarding the concavity of an entire root of this polynomial, which is connected to algebraic properties of the polynomial; and seeking analytically a concavifying function. This gives several <b>cases</b> in which <b>a</b> conformal solution exists. At last we show an implicit function theorem in the <b>case</b> of <b>a</b> manifold with negative scalar curvature, and find a conformal solution when the Lovelock theories are close to General Relativity.

40|$|A Brane {{evolving}} in {{the background}} of a charged AdS black-hole displays in general a bouncing behaviour with a smooth transition from a contracting to an expanding phase. We examine in detail the conditions and consequences of this behaviour in various <b>cases.</b> For <b>a</b> cosmological-constant-dominated Brane, we obtain a singularity-free, inflationary era which is shown to be compatible only with an intermediate-scale fundamental Planck mass. For a radiation-dominated Brane, the bouncing behaviour can occur only for backgroundcharge values exceeding those allowed for non-extremal black holes. For a matter-dominated Brane, the black-hole mass affects the proper volume or the expansion rate of the Brane. We also consider the Brane evolving in an asymmetric background of two distinct charged AdS black hole spacetimes being bounded by the Brane and find that, in the <b>case</b> of <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> critical Brane, bouncing behaviour occurs only if the black-hole mass difference is smaller than a certain value.

40|$|The cosmological {{concordance}} {{model is}} consistent with all available observational data, including the apparent distance and redshift relationship for distant supernovae, but it is curious how the Milne cosmological model is able to make predictions {{that are similar to}} this preferred General Relativistic model. Milne's cosmological model is based solely on Special Relativity and presumes a completely incompatible redshift mechanism; how then can the predictions be even remotely close to observational data? The puzzle is usually resolved by subsuming the Milne Cosmological model into General Relativistic cosmology as the special <b>case</b> of <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> Universe. This explanation may have to be reassessed with the finding that spacetime is approximately flat because of inflation, whereupon the projection of cosmological events onto the observer's Minkowski spacetime must always be kinematically consistent with Special Relativity, although the specific dynamics of the underlying General Relativistic model can give rise to virtual forces in order to maintain consistency between the observation and model frames.

It is shown that the Competitive equilibrium and the Core are robust with respect to negligible externalities and that the range of market prices in the Core belongs to range of Competitive equilibrium prices. However, these concepts yield no prediction for relatively severe externalities. Therefore, in order to provide a prediction the Bargaining set and the Multilateral Nash (MN) solution are also investigated. Surprisingly, in <b>case</b> of <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> Core the Bargaining set predicts a unique tuple of payofis which are independent of the externalities and each pair of participants is equally likely.
