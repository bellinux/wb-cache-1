However, the role of BTC in skin biology is still unknown. We employed transgenic mice overexpressing BTC ubiquitously to study its role in skin physiology. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased levels of BTC especially in the hair follicles and in the epidermis of transgenic animals. Expression of key markers of epithelial differentiation was unaltered, but keratinocyte proliferation was significantly increased. At post-natal day 1 (P 1), transgenic mice displayed a significant retardation of hair follicle morphogenesis. At P 17, when most follicles in control mice had initiated hair follicle cycling and had already entered into their first late <b>catagen</b> or telogen <b>phase,</b> all follicles of transgenic mice were still at the mid- to late <b>catagen</b> <b>phases,</b> indicating retarded initiation of hair follicle cycling. Healing of full-thickness excisional wounds and bursting strength of incisional wounds were similar in control and transgenic mice.

The purpose of this investigation was to find the components of woods and fungi that exert a proliferative activity on DP cells. Results show that the fungus YL 161 (ethyl acetate extract, 1 ppm),Agaricus blazei (ethyl acetate extract, 0.1 ppm), and the bark ofCamptotheca cuminata (methanol extract of bark, 0.1 ppm) exhibit higher growth-promoting activity than pentadecanoic acid.

40|$|Protease nexin- 1, a serine {{protease}} inhibitor, is expressed {{specifically in the}} dermal papilla (DP) of anagen hair follicles and is suggested {{to be one of}} the modulators of the cyclic growth of hair follicles. Accumulating evidence has shown that protease nexin- 1 plays its biologic role by inhibiting thrombin action in various systems other than the hair follicle. Thrombin has various physiologic functions including blood coagulation cascade, mostly via activation of protease-activated receptors (PAR). In this study, we investigated the expression of PAR mRNA using RT-PCR in dissected human hair follicles. We showed that PAR- 1 mRNA was expressed specifically in the mesenchymal portions, including DP and connective tissue sheath, of anagen hair follicles. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for PAR- 1 was detected in the DP and lower portion of connective tissue sheath in the anagen and <b>catagen</b> <b>phases</b> and in the DP of telogen hair follicles. Because only a pharmacologic level (100 nM) of thrombin significantly stimulated cell proliferation and DNA synthesis of the cultured dermal papilla cells, thrombin does not seem to have a mitogenic effect on dermal papilla cells physiologically. These results raise the possibility that thrombin is involved in the cyclic hair growth through its receptor of PAR- 1...|$|R

The biologic relevance of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis in the control of hair cycling, however, has remained unknown. We studied the expression and biologic role of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) during the induced adult hair follicle cycle in wild-type, TSP- 1 deficient, and TSP- 1 overexpressing transgenic mice. TSP- 1 expression was absent from hair bulb and dermal papilla cells during early to mid-anagen but was highly upregulated throughout the <b>catagen</b> involution <b>phase.</b> In TSP- 1 deficient mice, the follicle growth phase was significantly prolonged, associated with increased perifollicular vascularization and vascular proliferation. Conversely, hair follicle growth was delayed in K 14 /TSP- 1 transgenic mice that expressed high levels of TSP- 1 in outer root sheath keratinocytes, associated with reduced perifollicular vascularization. These effects were most probably mediated via its antiangiogenic effects because TSP- 1 {{did not affect the}} growth of cultured murine vibrissae {{in the absence of a}} functional vascular system.

In the 1 st hair cycle, the hair follicles of hW rats were shorter and less well developed than those of Wistar rats. In early anagen, eosinophilic bodies were observed in some hair follicles which showed immature histological features. By using Tdt-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) method and electron microscopic examination, these bodies were confirmed to be apoptotic bodies. These follicles seemed to disappear by abnormal regression. In late anagen phase, the follicles in which the apoptosis did not occur showed enlarged hair roots with hypertrophy of the inner root sheath. Subsequently, when the follicles in normal Wistar rats synchronously regressed in the <b>catagen</b> <b>phase,</b> most of the follicles in hW rats similarly entered the <b>catagen</b> <b>phase,</b> but a few follicles did not regress completely and showed aberrant hair root enlargement.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{documented}} an abnormal cell-mediated immune reaction in alopecia areata (AA) 1. The key histopatho logic feature of AA is a lymphocytic infiltrate around the lower hair follicle, which may {{appear in a}} characteristic “swarm of bees ” pattern. The affected hair follicles terminate their anagen phase prematurely and regress via the induction of massive apoptosis of the lower portion of the follicle (the <b>catagen</b> <b>phase),</b> which results in a resting hair follicle (the telogen phase). The hair follicles may then reenter the anagen phase, but {{in the presence of}} a lymphocytic infiltrate, the anagen is terminated prematurely, which results in miniaturized hair follicles. AA represents a disorder of hair follicle cycling in a dual sense: it almost exclusively attacks anagen hair follicles and then greatly disturbs hair follicle cycling by “catapulting ” anagen follicles into the <b>catagen</b> <b>phase</b> 2 The treatment of AA depends on the severity and extent of the disease. The medications include a topical irritant, and in mild cases, topical and intralesional steroids.

To characterize hair follicles in HHR, progression of hair cycle and expression profi les of basic hair keratins were immunohistochemically studied and {{compared with those of}} SDR.

Tässä väitöskirjatutkimuksessa käytettiin hiirimallia selvitettäessä Tudor-SN ja polyamiini-säädeltyjen proteiinien ilmentymistä ja toimintaa. Tudor-SN proteiinille on ehdotettu useita mekanismeja geenien ilmentymisen säätelijänä. Kuitenkaan itse Tudor-SN proteiinin ilmentymistä eri kudoksissa ei ole tarkoin tutkittu ja proteiinin fysiologinen merkitys on epäselvä. Tutkimuksessa selvisi, että Tudor-SN ilmentyy erityisesti nopeasti jakaantuvissa soluissa ja erilaistuvien solutyyppien jakaantuvissa esiastesoluissa. Tudor-SN poistogeenisen hiiren analyysissä todettiin sekä luuytimessä että verenkierrossa alentunut granulosyytti-solujen granulaarisuus sekä alentunut granulosyyttien määrä verenkierrossa. Tulokset ehdottavat, että Tudor-SN proteiini on merkityksellinen immuunijärjestelmässä. Luonnon polyamiineista putreskiini, spermidiini ja spermiini ovat ratkaisevia nisäkkäiden solujen erilaistumisessa ja lisääntymisessä. Tutkimuksessa selvitettiin polyamiinien vaikutusta karvan kasvuun, joka tapahtuu kolmessa eri vaiheessa: nopea solujakaantuminen (anagen), apoptoosi (catagen) ja loppuvaiheen lepotila (telogen). Anagen-vaiheessa olevissa karvasoluissa on raportoitu korkea polyamiinipitoisuus. Tässä tutkimuksessa selvitettiin metabolisesti stabiilin polyymiinianalogin, alpha-metyylispermidiinin vaikutus karvan kasvuun. Kahden viikon päivittäinen alpha-metyylispermidiini annostelu telogen-vaiheessa oleville hiirillä aikaansai uudelleen nopean solujakaantumisen, eli anagen-vaiheen. Tulosten mukaan polyamiineilla voidaan vaikuttaa karvan kasvuun hiirimallissa. Model organisms or {{reference}} {{organisms are}} non-human species, {{which are used}} to explore a given biological phenomenon deliberately to deduce the anticipated experimental findings to other organisms particularly to humans. Hypothetically, a given organism {{can be considered as}} a model organism when its size is small and it is competent to represent a certain specific organism by predicting myriads of biological and molecular processes related to genetics, development, physiology, evolution and ecology. By taking genetic conservation into account, a model organism with small size or simple form of life is expected to represent a larger organism including humans with complex genome and biological processes. Although no single organisms fulfill these theoretical criteria, most of our current knowledge of heredity, development, physiology and underlining molecular and cellular processes is obtained from studies based on model organisms. In this study, by using mouse as a model organism expression of Tudor-SN and polyamine regulated proteins were analyzed. Tudor-SN staphylococcal nuclease (Tudor-SN) is a 100 kDa protein that was initially identified as a transcriptional co-activator. It has also been shown to function as a modulator of RNA metabolism and biogenesis and a component in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Tudor-SN protein is highly conserved through evolution from unicellular organisms such as yeast to higher organisms and it exists as a single gene without any close homologs. However, comprehensive analysis of the expression of Tudor-SN has not been investigated and the physiological function of Tudor-SN is poorly understood. In this study the expression of Tudor-SN was investigated in mouse tissues and organs by immunohistochemistry, fluorescent immunostaining, Western blotting and RT-qPCR. Up-regulated or high level expression of Tudor-SN was observed in rapidly dividing and progenitor cells such as in spermatogonial cells of testis, in the follicular cells of ovary, in the cells of crypts of Lieberkühn of ileum and basal keratinocytes of skin and hair follicle when compared to more differentiated or terminally differentiated cells in the respective organs. Analysis of Tudor-SN knockout bone marrow and peripheral blood cells indicated decrease in granularity of granulocytes. The wide expression pattern of Tudor-SN and high expression in proliferating and self-differentiating cells suggests that the protein serves functions related to activated state of cells. Besides, decreases in the numbers of eosinophils and granularity in bone marrow granulocytic cells in Tudor-SN knockout mouse suggests that the protein has an important role in immune system. Natural polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine are crucial for mammalian cell differentiation and proliferation. In mammals, the growth of hair is characterized by three main cyclic phases of transformation, including a rapid growth phase (anagen), an apoptosis-driven regression <b>phase</b> (<b>catagen)</b> and a relatively quiescent resting phase (telogen). A high pool of polyamines is reported during the anagen phase compared to telogen and <b>catagen</b> <b>phases.</b> Hair cycle-associated fluctuation of polyamine concentrations and the skin abnormalities in the SSAT transgenic animals prompted us to investigate whether the growth of hair during the resting stage could be triggered by artificial elevation of the polyamine pool. However, natural polyamines are not stable molecules. α-Methylspermidine, a metabolically stable polyamine analog, has been used as surrogate molecule to elucidate the specific role of polyamines. The application of α-Methylspermidine in telogen mice induced hair growth after 2 weeks of daily topical application. The application site was characterized by typical features of anagen and the result suggests that polyamines {{play an important role in}} the regulation of hair cycle...|$|R

The transition of the papilla from its mature anagen condition to a greatly reduced and morphologically distinct form at telogen is associated with various intra- and extracellular changes. With the reduction in ground substance during catagen papillary cells aggregate as organelles of synthetic function are replaced by lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles. Maximal diminution of the papilla at telogen coincides with the cessation of vibrissa production in the matrix and a prominent thickening of the basal lamina with dense projections into the regressed papilla.

The bulge area functions as a niche, where epithelial stem cells are located and maintained.

We compared the effects of deleting the essential miRNA biogenesis enzymes Drosha and Dicer in mouse skin epithelial cells at successive postnatal time points. Deletion of either Drosha or Dicer during an established growth phase (anagen) caused failure of hair follicles to enter a normal <b>catagen</b> regression <b>phase,</b> eventual follicular degradation and stem cell loss. Deletion of Drosha or Dicer in resting phase follicles did not affect follicular structure or epithelial stem cell maintenance, and stimulation of anagen by hair plucking caused follicular proliferation and formation of a primitive transient amplifying matrix population. However, mutant matrix cells exhibited apoptosis and DNA damage and hair follicles rapidly degraded. Hair follicle defects at early time points post-deletion occurred {{in the absence of}} inflammation, but a dermal inflammatory response and hyperproliferation of interfollicular epidermis accompanied subsequent hair follicle degradation. These data reveal multiple functions for Drosha and Dicer in suppressing DNA damage in rapidly proliferating follicular matrix cells, facilitating catagen and maintaining follicular structures and their associated stem cells. Although Drosha and Dicer each possess independent non-miRNA-related functions, the similarity in phenotypes of the inducible epidermal Drosha and Dicer mutants indicates that these defects result primarily from failure of miRNA processing. Consistent with this, Dicer deletion resulted in the upregulation of multiple direct targets of the highly expressed epithelial miRNA miR- 205. © 2012.

This cyclical growth of hair is regulated by a diversity of growth factors. Although normal expression of both epidermal growth factor and its receptor (EGFR) in the outer root sheath is down-regulated with the completion of follicular growth, here we show that continuous expression of epidermal growth factor in hair follicles of transgenic mice arrested follicular development at {{the final stage of}} morphogenesis. Data from immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting showed that epidermal growth factor signals through EGFR/ErbB 2 heterodimers in skin. Furthermore, topical application of tyrphostin AG 1478 or AG 825, specific inhibitors of EGFR and ErbB 2, respectively, completely inhibited new hair growth in wild type mice but not in transgenic mice. When the transgenic mice were crossed with waved- 2 mice, which possess a lower kinase activity of EGFR, the hair phenotype was rescued in the offspring. Taken together, these data suggest that EGFR signaling is indispensable for the initiation of hair growth. On the other hand, continuous expression of epidermal growth factor prevents entry into the <b>catagen</b> <b>phase.</b> We propose that epidermal growth factor functions as a biologic switch that is turned on and off in hair follicles {{at the beginning and end}} of the anagen phase of the hair cycle, guarding the entry to and exit from the anagen phase. postprin...|$|E
40|$|The {{involvement}} of transforming growth factor-β isoforms in the induction of the regressing phase (catagen) {{of human hair}} follicles were examined in vivo. In the growing phase (anagen), transforming growth factor-β 1 was detected at the hair cuticle and connective tissue sheath. Transforming growth factor-β 2 was restricted to the outermost cell layer of the outer root sheath. Transforming growth factor-β 3 was observed in the precortical hair matrix of anagen hair follicles. During the anagen–catagen transition phase, strong transforming growth factor-β 2 immunoreactivity appeared in the lower bulb matrix cells adjacent to the dermal papilla. In addition, transforming growth factor-β 2 and transforming growth factor-β type II receptor were colocalized in the regressing epithelial strands, where terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling-positive apoptotic cells were also found. Transforming growth factor-β 1 and transforming growth factor-β 3 were mostly negative in the strand. Using an organ culture system, we investigated whether transforming growth factor-β 2 and its antagonists affected the transition process. Elongation of hair was significantly suppressed by transforming growth factor-β 2. Next, a neutralizing antibody and fetuin, a potent transforming growth factor-β antagonist was tested. In {{the presence of the}} antibody as well as fetuin, hair follicles were markedly elongated in a concentration-dependent manner. These results strongly suggest that transforming growth factor-β 2 plays an essential part in the induction of the <b>catagen</b> <b>phase</b> of the human hair cycle...|$|E
40|$|Follicular papilla (FP) cells, but {{not their}} closely related dermal fibroblasts, can {{maintain}} hair growth suggesting cell type-specific molecular signals. To define the molecular {{differences between these}} two cell types, we generated a subtraction complementary DNA (cDNA) library highly enriched in FP-specific cDNA. Differential screening identified FP- 1 as the most abundant cDNA sequence in this subtraction library. FP- 1 message RNA is highly abundant in cultured rat vibrissa FP cells, can be detected at very low levels in the stomach and the ovary, and is undetectable in cultured dermal fibroblasts and in 16 rat non-follicular tissues. The full-length, 2. 3 kb FP- 1 cDNA encodes a protein of 549 amino acids harboring a signal peptide, collagen triple helix repeats, and an olfactomedin-like domain. Monospecific rabbit antibodies to FP- 1 recognize in cultured FP cells a single ∼ 72 kDa glycoprotein with a ∼ 60 kDa protein core. FP- 1 protein is expressed in vivo in a hair cycle-dependent manner, {{as it can be}} detected in FP during anagen, but not in <b>catagen</b> and telogen <b>phases</b> of the hair cycle. FP- 1 is presumably a highly specific extracellular matrix protein synthesized by FP cells and may be involved in the organization of FP during certain phases of normal or pathological hair growth...|$|R
40|$|Cancer {{chemotherapy}} {{is associated}} with serious side effects, including temporary hair loss and impairment of pigmentation. We suspect that ectopic melanin deposition occurring due to chemotherapy may add to these effects worsening the already unpleasant symptoms. We associated the ectopic occurrence of follicular melanin after chemotherapy with splenic melanosis - an interesting example of extradermal melanin localization - and we expected an increase in splenic melanin deposition after chemotherapy. Using the C 57 BL/ 6 murine model of synchronized hair cycle induced by depilation, we visualized splenic melanin by means of several histological and histochemical protocols of staining: hematoxylin and eosin, May-Grünwald-Giemsa and Fontana-Masson. Unexpectedly, the splenic deposition of melanin decreased due to application of cyclophosphamide (i. p. 120 mg/ kg body weight on day 9 post depilation). The drop was abrupt and lasted for at least 5 days (day 13 - 18 post depilation), as compared with normal hair cycle. Moreover, in mice with normal, depilation-induced hair cycle we observed a similar drop shortly before entering catagen (day 15 post depilation), followed by a slow and partial increase in splenic melanization up to day 27 post depilation in both groups. We conclude that cyclophosphamide negatively affects splenic melanization and/or extradermal transfer of ectopic melanin from the dystrophic hair follicles, but the most powerful down-regulator of splenic melanosis is normal and dystrophic <b>catagen</b> - the <b>phase</b> of hair follicle involution and re-modelling...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{the hair}} {{follicle}} anatomy and the dynamics of hair cycling is substantial. Recognizing the anagen, <b>catagen</b> and telogen <b>phases</b> as well as teloptosis and the hair eclipse phenomenon clearly characterizes the typical hair chronobiology. Physiological modulators include hormones, neuromediators, miscellaneous biomolecules, seasons, micro-inflammation and ageing. For individuals who present with the complaint of increased hair shedding or alopecia, a host of evaluation techniques are available in addition to history, physical examination and laboratory assessment. Various clinical hair techniques can help in assessing the efficacy of drugs and cosmetics on hair growth. The methods are quite {{similar to those used}} to establish a definite diagnosis in dermatological practice. Great strides have been made during the recent decades in the methodology of hair growth trials in dermatology and cosmetology. Clinical evaluations benefit from a few additional specific techniques that enhance the perception of hair (re-) growth, shedding and alopecia. These assessments include the determination of hair patterning and density that may be helped by the 'black-and-white felt' examination. Daily hair counts, the 'hair pull test' and the 'hair feathering test' are also available. Instrumental methods provide reliable quantitative information that is useful if there are adequate controls. Some photographic methods, the trichogram, hair weighing and variants {{of the hair}} growth window technique including the phototrichogram, videotrichogram and tractio-phototrichogram provide insight into the complexities of hair cycling and shedding. Skin biopsy is indicated for diagnostic purposes, especially when the hair loss is accompanied by scarring. Peer reviewe...|$|R
