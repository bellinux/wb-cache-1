In addition, the holder may drive a motor tractor or other motor vehicles with an unladen weight of less than 2,500kg. A class 3A licence limits the holder to drive motor vehicles without a <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal,</b> typically automatic transmission cars, whereas a class 3 licence allows the holder to drive all motor vehicles.

25|$|Cars are {{equipped}} with controls used for driving, passenger comfort and safety, normally operated {{by a combination of}} the use of feet and hands, and occasionally by voice on 2000s-era cars. These controls include a steering wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed (and, in a manual transmission car, a <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal),</b> a shift lever or stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights, ventilation and other functions. Modern cars' controls are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake, but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies, for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.|$|E

25|$|Given this scenario, Senna secured an IndyCar testing {{session with}} the support of conpatriot and Penske driver, Emerson Fittipaldi. In December 1992, in fact, Senna visited Firebird International Raceway in Chandler, Arizona, to test a 1992 Penske PC-21 racer. Unlike the more {{advanced}} F1 cars, this IndyCar was powered by a turbo Chevrolet-Ilmor V8, had a traditional transmission with <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> and iron brakes, and was markedly heavier due to its bigger physical size in comparison to a smaller Formula One car. To familiarise himself, Senna initially ran 14 relatively slow laps before completing a further 10 laps on the same tyres and setting a best time of 49.09 seconds. By comparison, Fittipaldi had set a best time of 49.70 seconds, which he later improved to 48.5 seconds, only by using the new 1993 Penske PC-22 at his disposal during this test session.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{where it was}} difficult for teams to alter their car's race set-ups because of strong crosswinds, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the day at one minute and 39.085 seconds on super-soft compound tyres; Rosberg was three-thousands of a second slower in second and had the fastest time until Hamilton's lap. Both Mercedes cars had reliability concerns with Hamilton reporting another gearbox problem and his session ended early because of a minor hydraulic issue. Rosberg had an downshifting concern which he later attributed to hitting his <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> after lifting his leg. Alonso was third-fastest, followed by Ricciardo, Massa (who locked his brakes lightly and later spun his car) and Kimi Räikkönen. Kvyat, Magnussen, Button and Hülkenberg followed in the top ten. Romain Grosjean and his teammate Pastor Maldonado both spun in their tight-handling Lotus cars and both drivers went off into the run-off area multiple times.|$|E
500|$|The race {{took place}} in the {{afternoon}} from 14:00 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2). The conditions on the grid were cloudy before the start; there was an air temperature between [...] with an track temperature ranging from [...] and no rain was expected. The top ten qualifiers started on the super-soft compound tyre. As the five red lights went out to signal the start of the race, Vettel released his <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal,</b> found that he had poor acceleration driving off his starting position, but avoided stalling his engine. He drove right towards Alonso in an attempt to squeeze the latter towards the pit lane wall heading into the first corner. Alonso was running on the racing line and managed to overtake Vettel. However, neither driver took the lead as Massa had made a fast start and passed both drivers around the outside. Button avoided hitting the back-end of Vettel's car by swerving and braking early for the first corner. Further round, Alguersuari committed to the braking zone late at the turn six hairpin, drove into the rear of his teammate Buemi, which removed Buemi's rear wing and Alguerusari's front wing, and debris was littered across the track. Hamilton passed Webber for fourth place on the same lap. At {{the end of the first}} lap, the order was: Massa, Alonso, Vettel, Hamilton, Webber, Button, Kubica, Schumacher, Rosberg and Kobayashi.|$|E
50|$|Pedals may be {{used for}} driving {{simulations}} or flight simulations. In the former case, an asymmetric set of pedals can simulate accelerator, brake, and <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals</b> in a real automobile. In the latter case, a symmetric set of pedals simulates rudder controls and toe brakes in an aircraft. As mentioned, most steering wheel controllers come with a set of pedals.|$|R
50|$|In December 1972, a five-door van (L50VF, with sliding side doors) was added. Three months later, the {{dropside}} L51 went on sale. In November 1973 the Carry {{underwent a}} minor facelift, receiving a new grille and modified front bumper. The interior was also updated, {{with a new}} dashboard and finally hanging gas and <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals.</b> The fifth generation Carry led Suzuki to great market success, with Suzuki selling more kei trucks than all others during 1973 and 1974.|$|R
5000|$|... iRacing only {{allows the}} use of a {{realistic}} cockpit view. As with real auto racing, the driver only has a view from behind the steering wheel. Most users use a force feedback steering wheel with gas, brake, and <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals,</b> as well as H-pattern shifters and/or sequential shifters. A gamepad can be used, though it is discouraged and puts the user at a competitive disadvantage. The gameplay is developed to mimic auto racing in as much detail as possible.|$|R
2500|$|For the 1940 model, Oldsmobile was {{the first}} auto {{manufacturer}} to offer a fully automatic transmission, called the [...] "Hydramatic", which features four forward speeds. It has a gas pedal and a brake—no <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal.</b> The gear selector is on the steering column.|$|E
2500|$|A direct-shift gearbox (...) , {{commonly}} {{abbreviated to}} DSG, is an electronically controlled dual-clutch multiple-shaft manual gearbox in a transaxle design, without a conventional <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> and with fully automatic or semi-manual control.

2500|$|A new [...] "E-stick" [...] option {{combined}} {{a manual}} 3-speed transmission {{with an automatic}} clutch as a low-cost alternative to the fully automatic transmission. The E-stick was also available in conjunction with an overdrive unit. The system cost $59.50, but offered stick-shift economy, performance, and driver control without a <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> by using engine oil pressure and intake manifold vacuum to engage and disengage the clutch when shifting gears.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Recent {{developments}} were oriented on {{two high}} flow, high modulus fiber-glass reinforced nylon 6 (HMG series) grades for automotive and other industrial applications requiring high stiffness and high strength. These materials combined the following improved technological (injection molding, vibration welding, etc.) and mechanical performance properties such as greater dimensional stability, higher short-term (strength and stiffness) and long-term (fatigue and creep). The current and possible applications of these plastics includes auto mirror housing brackets, <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals,</b> <b>clutch</b> master cylinders, ski bindings, steering wheels, levers, auto seat frames, door handles and door lock mechanisms.

40|$|New {{technology}} in the automotive industry {{is the key to}} success. Therefore, it is appreciated when people come with new design ways to solve problems. This leads to innovation in the automotive industry that will lead to better and more environmentally friendly cars. This report presents a concept on a pushing counter lever spring which provides the same characteristics of force curve as a diaphragm spring in a pressure plate of a car has. The mechanism is to be used for long-term testing and evaluating <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals.</b> The work describes the development process and the manufacture of a prototype. The program Creo (CAD / 3 D) is largely used to construct the components. As are the subprograms Mechanism Design and Simulate to simulate the movement and loads. Excel is a great help at the theoretical calculation of the mechanism and to evaluate the theory behind the concept. The result shows how to simulate a diaphragm spring in the pressure plate in a car for long-term testing of <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals.</b> The goal is to accurately mimic the force curve of a diaphragm spring, in order to design better pedals, and thus reduce the weight on the pedals to in turn reduce fuel consumption to protect the environment {{is one of the most}} important factors of all in the automotive industry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The design {{modification}} proposed is that {{of integrating}} acceleration and clutch mechanism under a single pedal control. By this modification the major out turn is that the vehicle accelerates as and when the <b>Clutch</b> Acceleration <b>Pedal</b> is released, instead of acceleration by pedal pressing {{as in the case}} of conventional cars. In this design the clutch mechanism is operated when the <b>Clutch</b> Acceleration <b>pedal</b> pressed to the maximum. At the end of pedal by having mechanical linkage, acceleration mechanism is neutralized and a further force extends the rod which operates the clutch. This way we bring two mechanisms under a single pedal...|$|R
2500|$|In 1937, Oldsmobile was {{a pioneer}} in {{introducing}} a four-speed semi-automatic transmission called the [...] "Automatic Safety Transmission", although this accessory was actually built by Buick, which would offer it in its own cars in 1938. This transmission features a conventional <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal,</b> which the driver presses before selecting either [...] "low" [...] or [...] "high" [...] range. In [...] "low," [...] the car shifts between first and second gears. In [...] "high," [...] the car shifts among first, third and fourth gears.|$|E
2500|$|One {{novel model}} was the 2CV Sahara, a four-wheel drive (4×4) car, {{equipped}} with two engines (12hp each), each one having a separate fuel tank. One was {{mounted in the}} front driving the front wheels {{and one in the}} back driving the rear wheels. A single gearstick, <b>clutch</b> <b>pedal</b> and accelerator were connected to both engines. It was originally intended for use by the French colonies in Northern Africa. As well as a decreased chance of being stranded, it provided four-wheel-drive traction with continuous drive to some wheels while others were slipping because the engine transmissions were uncoupled. Therefore, it became popular with off-road enthusiasts. Between 1958 and 1971, Citroën built 694 Saharas. The top speed was [...] on one engine, and [...] with both engines running. These rare vehicles are highly collectible.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} {{use for a}} parking brake is to keep a vehicle {{motionless}} when it is parked. Parking brakes have a ratchet locking mechanism that will keep them engaged until a release button is pressed. On vehicles with automatic transmissions, this is usually used in concert with a parking pawl in the transmission. In vehicles with manual transmission the hand brake is also routinely used to assist in hill starts as this frees both feet for use on the accelerator and <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals.</b> A skilled motorist should {{always be able to}} get the car moving without rolling back at all.|$|R

5000|$|It had an {{integral}} chassis/body made largely of plywood, with a tubular frame {{at the rear}} for the engine and transmission. The engine was a rear-mounted, air-cooled (fan-assisted), 10 hp vee-twin engine made by Precision and equipped with a Degory carburettor. Transmission was via a four speed Jardine gearbox. Final drive to the rear axle was by chain, the rear chain tension being adjusted by moving the axle in the frame. A lever offered a combined exhaust lifter and connection by rod to a [...] "kick-starter". As regards the brake and <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals</b> the pivot point can be moved so as to adjust the leverage to suite the driver. The brakes (on two wheels) were of external contracting type.|$|R

50|$|The Series 2 1750 GTV of 1970 {{introduced}} other mechanical changes, {{including a}} dual circuit braking system (split front and rear, with separate servos). The brake and <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals</b> on {{left hand drive}} cars were also of an improved pendant design, instead of the earlier floor-hinged type. On right hand drive cars the floor-hinged pedals were retained, as there was no space for the pedal box behind the carburettors. Externally, the series 2 1750 GTV is identified by new, slimmer bumpers with front and rear overriders. The combined front indicator and sidelight units were now mounted to the front panel instead of the front bumper, except again on the 1971-72 US/Canadian market cars. The interior was slightly modified, with the seats retaining the same basic outline but following a simpler design.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{conventional}} brake, accelerator and <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals</b> of automotive vehicles {{are replaced by}} polymeric-based composite pedals.

In this paper four different sections of polymeric based brake pedals are analyzed as per the design parameters received from General motors. The sections are analyzed and arrived at a winning concept based on stiffness comparison. A full scale model is developed from the winning concept, while developing full scale model an ergonomic study has been made on few hatch back and SUVs car’s to improve the driver’s comfort and reduce fatigue due to breaking operation. The pedal is modelled using CATIA software and analysis is carried out in ANSYS software. The results have shown polymeric-based composite material meets the requirements of manufacturer’s specification and can be replaced with present metallic pedal. Weight reduction of 66. 7 % is achieved by using composite material...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of the vehicle sideslip angle is fundamental to improve reliability of the vehicle dynamics control systems focused on stability and developed both for safety and performance optimization. Many experimental procedures to estimate the vehicle sideslip angle have been proposed in the last years, mainly based on GPS, INS and physical models. The aim {{of this paper is}} to compare different methods to estimate sideslip angle employing an instrumented vehicle, equipped with a system for data acquisition and time-synchronized storage capabilities, a stand-alone GPS, a GPS aided MEMS-based Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) and specific sensors to collect data on the steering wheel angle and on the position of brake, throttle and <b>clutch</b> <b>pedals.</b> Further information is collected by capturing the available data at the OBD port of the vehicle. Data acquisitions (from all sensors) are synchronized by means of an external triggering signal. After driving sessions performed with specific manoeuvres in order to highlight the main phenomena concerned with the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle, the different estimation procedures have been applied, discussing on the advantages and the degree of reliability of each one of them...|$|R
