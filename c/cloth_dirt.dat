50|$|In 1866, Arnold and his {{youngest}} brother Ludwig {{set up a}} business in Hauset (die Kupfermühle, a vacant copper mill at the river Geul). Because they didn't have the thread to weave nor money to buy it, they decided to dye thread for the industry, but {{there was too much}} competition from the industry in Eupen and Aachen. In 1873, Arnold married Anna Küppers from Aachen and later that year their first son Peter was born. Luckily, that year, money and cloth from the inheritance became available, but because of the competition from Eupen and Aachen, the Verviers textile industry started selling its <b>cloth</b> <b>dirt</b> cheap, so the brothers didn't find any buyers for the cloth. From pharmacist Knittel (a distant relative) in Vaals they heard that a new orphanage in Heerlen ('het St Jozephsgesticht') could do with someone to teach the orphans a trade like weaving. This pharmacist also bought his herbs from Heerlen and since Anna had worked at her father's gardening business she figured she could also package and sell medicinal herbs and could take over that business. In March 1874, the brothers went to the St Joseph market in Sittard with samples of the cloth to try to sell it, but were unsuccessful due to the competition from the Belgian Vesdre-manufacturers. Following Anna's advice, they returned via Heerlen, to speak to the rector of the orphanage, monseigneur Savelberg. (They stayed at well-known Hotel Cloot at the corner of Bongerd and Emmastraat - Arnold's son Peter would later marry Christine Cloot.) Since Savelberg {{took a long time to}} decide, Arnold's old plans to go to either Russia (where his brothers were) or New Orleans in the USA were reconsidered. Anna didn't like the former because of Wilhelm's stories of hard work and inexperienced colleagues. But New Orleans appealed to her because according to an old Wanderbursche-friend of Arnold, Joseph Kops, who had emigrated there, there was a great need for artisans in the United States. In May they had even already started informing about the price of such a trip (cheapest option 160 Belgian Francs per adult plus 15 GFrancs for the baby) when word finally came from rector Savelberg. So in August 1874 they went from Hauset to Heerlen with three looms and some cloth.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the best}} things a child is endowed with at birth is a strong will. What is a ship without the helm? Men can enhance their willpower and {{endurance}} in many ways. I’m going to mention but one thing. That is swimming, which is rightly referred to as the sport of all sports. Swimming is the sport, that trains all the muscles equally and keeps the body clean, but the cleanness of the mind is grounded, in a sense, on the cleanness of the body. It is insufficient to wash the face and hands, or that which can be seen, and letting the <b>cloths</b> cover the <b>dirt</b> on the body. Those who do that are “like unto whited sepulchres, full of dead men’s bones” (Skinfaxi 1928, p. 32; from Mathew 23 : 27).|$|R
50|$|As {{the mine}} developed, workers camped out nearby, {{building}} shanties of corrugated iron and hessian <b>cloth,</b> some with <b>dirt</b> floors. The town of Gwalia was born. Meanwhile, an {{area to the}} north was being surveyed, which became the town of Leonora. Leonora was formally established in 1898, and the two towns developed a certain rivalry. This was eased when a steam tramway was built linking the two towns (1903), adding to the rail link from Kalgoorlie built the year before. It was the first such tramway built in Western Australia. It was replaced by an electric tram in 1907. An electricity generating station was established in 1902 to provide power to the mines. It was fired by mulga timber gathered from surrounding areas {{and a number of}} 2-foot gauge tramways were laid to enable haulage. Gwalia also became home to the state's first public swimming pool, and the first State Hotel (1903). While the pool saw abandonment {{along with the rest of}} the town when the mine closed, the hotel remained occupied by various tenants, and stands today as a popular attraction.|$|R
