60|$|Seen from a {{distance}} in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own, which appeared impervious to the sun's rays. You only knew the town was there, because you knew {{there could have been}} no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town. A blur of soot and smoke, now confusedly tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of Heaven, now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose and fell, or changed its quarter: a dense formless jumble, with sheets of <b>cross</b> <b>light</b> in it, that showed nothing but masses of darkness:- Coketown in the distance was suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could be seen.|$|E
6000|$|Cousin Maria {{made her}} appearance, {{attended}} {{by a couple}} of gardener's boys bearing baskets of flowers, with which it was proposed to decorate Madame de Bernstein's drawing-room against the arrival of her ladyship's company. Three footmen in livery, gorgeously laced with worsted, set out twice as many card-tables. A major-domo in black and a bag, with fine laced ruffles; and looking as if he ought to have a sword by his side, followed the lacqueys bearing fasces of wax candles, which he placed a pair on each card-table, and in the silver sconces on the wainscoted wall that was now gilt with the slanting rays of the sun, as was the prospect of the green common beyond, with its rocks and clumps of trees and houses twinkling in the sunshine. Groups of many-coloured figures in hoops and powder and brocade sauntered over the green, and dappled the plain with their shadows. On the other side from the Baroness's windows you saw the Pantiles, where a perpetual fair was held, and heard the clatter and buzzing of the company. A band of music was here performing {{for the benefit of the}} visitors to the Wells. Madame Bernstein's chief sitting-room might not suit a recluse or a student, but for those who liked bustle, gaiety, a bright <b>cross</b> <b>light,</b> and a view of all that was going on in the cheery busy place, no lodging could be pleasanter. And when the windows were lighted up, the passengers walking below were aware that her ladyship was at home and holding a card-assembly, to which an introduction was easy enough. By the way, in speaking of the past, I think the night-life of society a hundred years since was rather a dark life. There was not one wax-candle for ten which we now see in a lady's drawing-room: let alone gas and the wondrous new illuminations of clubs. Horrible guttering tallow smoked and stunk in passages. The candle-snuffer was a notorious officer in the theatre. See Hogarth's pictures: how dark they are, and how his feasts are, as it were, begrimed with tallow! In [...] "Marriage a la Mode," [...] in Lord Viscount Squanderfield's grand saloons, where he and his wife are sitting yawning before the horror-stricken steward when their party is over--there are but eight candles--one on each card-table, and half a dozen in a brass chandelier. If Jack Briefless convoked his friends to oysters and beer in his chambers, Pump Court, he would have twice as many. Let us comfort ourselves by thinking that Louis Quatorze in all his glory held his revels in the dark, and bless Mr. Price and other Luciferous benefactors of mankind, for banishing the abominable mutton of our youth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{comes up}} with an stereo {{matching}} method for handy-scanner based on <b>cross</b> <b>light.</b> The handy-scan system with two cameras and one cross laser beam can scan very detail accurately through cross laser. 3 D information is gained by dealing with cross laser image. What we do aims at estimating {{the transformation of the}} measured objects under the world coordinate. In order to achieve this goal, firstly we use 8 -points algorithm to compute fundamental matrix. Then, the points on {{the left and the right}} can be matched based on fundamental matrix. The 3 D coordinates of the point on the cross laser can be obtained by triangulation and curve surface differential. The experiment proves that this algorithm solves the problem of calculating the matching points in disorder. And in some way, it increases efficiency of matching cross laser stripes...|$|E
40|$|A nanostructured {{thick film}} gas sensor, based on {{semiconducting}} oxides, {{is an excellent}} candidate for a large-scale distribution of environmental detection points. Semiconducting oxide-based thick film gas sensors exhibit adequate properties for atm. environmental monitoring provided the phys. and microstructural properties of the materials are properly correlated to the required elec. features. To demonstrate {{the possibility of using}} semiconducting thick film gas sensors for atm. environmental monitoring, sensors were tested in the lab. and field. They were placed in an array inserted in a self-consistent unit and exposed to an actual atm. next to a conventional environmental monitoring station near a <b>cross</b> <b>light</b> in Ferrara, Italy. The conventional monitoring station is controlled by ARPA (Regional Agency for Environmental Prevention), Ferrara Section.

40|$|The {{test groups}} of animals showed {{different}} reaction {{on the presence}} of electric power line (EPL) glades, which <b>cross</b> <b>light</b> and dark conifer formations. The microarthropods react on the changes of hydrotermic soil conditions in a higher degree. The direct influence of electromagnetic field on the population density of soil invertebrates has place in both forest formations, but with opposite consequences. The same is demonstrated by herpetobium elements: the clear dominance of «meadow» species in fir formations and the absence of this in pine parts. Small mammals on the LEP glades increase their abundance and species diversity. They also demonstrate that their distribution is dominated by food and protection conditions. But at the same time, the distribution of constant rodent winter refuges demonstrate the negative effects of EPL existence. The analysis of bird populations on the basis of optimal life conditions demonstrated a highest negative effect of electromagnetic field of EPL. Independently of the creation of good protection, food and nesting conditions for birds, which usually occupy open biotopes and bush with herb thickets, they avoid the EPL glades. The first results showed the dual effect of EPL glades on animal populations. It is necessary {{to take into account the}} forming of intrazonal locations and real electromagnetic effects. The significant conclusions are found for birds, because they receive more irradiation. Also some biological peculiarities are important: the migratory species have a possibility to react immediately, according to the season, on the changing of biotopes. As for other animal groups, it is necessary to prolong the study of seasonal changes. For the invertebrates it must be performed the instrumental analysis of the differences of hydrotermic conditions of EPL glades and native biotopes...|$|E

40|$|Binary microlensing light curves have {{a variety}} of morphologies. Many are indistinguishable from point lens light curves. Of those that deviate from the point lens form, caustic <b>crossing</b> <b>light</b> curves have tended to {{dominate}} identified binary lens events. Other distinctive signatures of binary lenses include significant asymmetry, multiple peaks, and repeating events. We have quantified, using high resolution simulations, the theoretically expected relative numbers of each type of binary lens event, based on its measurable characteristics. We find that a microlensing survey with current levels of photometric uncertainty and sampling should find at least as many non-caustic crossing binary lens events as caustic crossing events; in future surveys with more sensitive photometry, the contribution of distinctive non-caustic crossing events will be even greater. To try to explain why caustic <b>crossing</b> <b>light</b> curves appear to be so dominant among the published binary lensing events, we investigate the influence of several physical effects, including blending, sampling rate, and various binary populations.
