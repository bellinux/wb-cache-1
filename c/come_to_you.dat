5|$|BBC Two premiered a new {{adaptation}} by Neil Cross of M. R. James's Oh, Whistle and I'll <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> My Lad on Christmas Eve 2010.|$|E
5|$|For Christmas 1979 the BBC {{produced}} a 70-minute-long adaptation of Sheridan Le Fanu's gothic tale Schalcken the Painter, directed and adapted by Leslie Megahey. Like the earlier Whistle and I'll <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> the production {{was listed as}} part of the long-running BBC arts series Omnibus.|$|E
5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} you before now is this: You deserve the truth.

There's been enough of that.|$|E

5|$|A Warning to the Curious, The Signalman and Miller's Whistle and I'll <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> were {{released}} as individual VHS cassettes and Region 2 DVDs by the British Film Institute in 2002 and 2003. A {{number of the}} adaptations were made available in Region 4 format in Australia in 2011 and The Signalman is included as an extra on the Region 1 American DVD release of the 1995 BBC production of Hard Times. For Christmas 2011, the BFI featured the complete 1970s films in their Mediatheque centres.|$|E
5|$|An earlier {{black-and-white}} {{adaptation of}} M. R. James's Whistle and I'll <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> directed by Jonathan Miller and shown {{as part of}} the series Omnibus in 1968, is often cited as an influence upon the production of the films, and is sometimes included {{as part of the}} series. The series was revived by the BBC in 2005 with a new set of adaptations that were produced intermittently over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|The BFI {{released}} the {{complete set of}} Ghost Story for Christmas films plus related works such as both versions of Whistle and I'll <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> on Region 2 DVD in 2012, in five volumes {{as well as a}} box set, in celebration of the 150th anniversary of M. R. James's birth. The following year, an expanded boxset featuring Robert Powell and Michael Bryant narrating M. R. James in the series Classic Ghost Stories (1986) and Spine Chillers (1980) respectively.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Hordern met the British theatre {{director}} Jonathan Miller, who cast him in Whistle and I'll <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> which was recorded for television and received wide praise. Hordern's next major play was Jumpers which {{appeared at the}} Royal National Theatre {{at the start of}} 1972. His performance was praised by critics and he reprised the role four years later. His television commitments increased towards the end of his life. His credits include Paradise Postponed, the BAFTA award-winning Memento Mori, and the BBC adaptation of Middlemarch. He was appointed a CBE in 1972 and was knighted eleven years later. Hordern suffered from kidney disease during the 1990s and died from it in 1995 at the age of 83.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{variously}} {{described as a}} recreation or re-enactment of this source material, or else as a homage, a pastiche a [...] "loving, but merciless" [...] parody, or spoof of it. Pemberton denied that the episode was a parody, claiming that it was [...] "just an affectionate and hopefully authentic re-creation". In addition to those influences mentioned by the writers, commentators identified Acorn Antiques, Psycho, Tales from the Crypt, Dead of Night, Whistle and I'll <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> and Garth Marenghi's Darkplace as potential influences.|$|E
500|$|The {{similarities}} {{begin with}} the first movement, which {{like that of the}} previous year´s cantata, is given to the bass as the vox Christi. The movement is the quotation of verse 7 from the gospel, beginning: [...] "" [...] (It is good for you that I leave; for if I did not go, the Comforter would not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.)</b> It is between aria and arioso. An oboe d'amore as the obbligato instrument plays extended melodies. Voice and oboe share the musical material, conveying [...] "the mood of grieving at parting".|$|E

500|$|OutKast {{recorded}} the album in sessions at several Atlanta studios—Bosstown Recording Studios, Doppler Recording Studios, PatchWerk Recording Studio, Purple Dragon Studios, and Studio LaCoCo—as well as Chung King Recording Studio and Sound On Sound Recording in New York City. For ATLiens, the band aimed for a consistent set of songs {{in which a}} listener would not need to skip tracks; OutKast wrote around 35 songs for the album and reduced them to fourteen. The duo's songwriting style for the album had no solid structure and was mostly spontaneous; Big Boi noted, [...] "Stuff'll just <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I'll be sittin' in the truck, and I'll start rhymin'. People {{look at me like}} I'm crazy, but that's how it starts." ...|$|E
500|$|While Windows RT {{functions}} {{similarly to}} Windows 8, {{there are still}} some notable differences, primarily involving software and hardware compatibility. Julie Larson-Green, then {{executive vice president of the}} Devices and Studios group at Microsoft, explained that Windows RT was ultimately designed to provide a [...] "closed, turnkey" [...] user experience, [...] "where it doesn't have all the flexibility of Windows, but it has the power of Office and then all the new style applications. So you could give it to your kid and he's not going to load it up with a bunch of toolbars accidentally out of Internet Explorer and then <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> later and say, 'why am I getting all these pop-ups?' It just isn't capable of doing that by design." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know what? I can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, I started writing all the records." ...|$|E

500|$|Hordern {{first met}} the British theatre {{director}} Jonathan Miller in 1968. Miller, {{who had long}} been an admirer of Hordern, offered him {{the part of the}} agonistic Professor Parkin in his forthcoming television drama Whistle and I'll <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> <b>You.</b> Hordern, who had heard positive things of Miller from theatrical friends, likewise thought highly of the director, and was quick to take up location filming in Norfolk that year. [...] He came to like Miller's way of working, such as having the freedom to improvise instead of adhering to the strict rules of a script; the actor wrote in his autobiography that he had never experienced that degree of professional freedom. The programme was released towards the end of 1968 and was a hit with audiences and critics. Mark Duguid of the British Film Institute called it [...] "a masterpiece of economical horror that remains every bit as chilling as the day it was first broadcast", while a journalist for The Telegraph, writing in 2010 about that year's remake starring John Hurt, reminded readers of the [...] "brilliant Sixties production by Jonathan Miller [...] Michael Hordern made a fine, crusty Parkin". The year ended with a role in Peter Hall's production of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance at the Aldwych Theatre. The piece received lukewarm reviews, with Hilary Spurling of The Spectator thinking Hordern was [...] "ill-served" [...] as the principal character, Tobias.|$|E
500|$|From Molossia, Themistocles {{apparently}} fled to Pydna, {{from where}} he took a ship for Asia Minor. This ship was blown off course by a storm, and ended up at Naxos, which an Athenian fleet {{was in the process}} of besieging. Desperate to avoid identification, Themistocles pestered the captain of the ship to continue the journey immediately. According to Thucydides, who wrote within living memory of the events, the ship eventually landed safely at Ephesus, where Themistocles disembarked. Plutarch has the ship docking at Cyme in Aeolia, and Diodorus has Themistocles making his way to Asia in an undefined manner. Diodorus and Plutarch next recount a similar tale, namely that Themistocles stayed briefly with an acquaintance (Lysitheides or Nicogenes) who was also acquainted with the Persian king, Artaxerxes I. Since there was a bounty on Themistocles's head, this acquaintance devised a plan to safely convey Themistocles to the Persian king in the type of covered wagon that the King's concubines travelled in. All three chroniclers agree that Themistocles's next move was to contact the Persian king; in Thucydides, this is by letter, while Plutarch and Diodorus have a face-to-face meeting with the king. The spirit is, however, the same in all three: Themistocles introduces himself to the king and seeks to enter his service: [...] "I, Themistocles, am <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> who did your house more harm than any of the Hellenes, when I was compelled to defend myself against your father's invasion—harm, however, far surpassed by the good that I did him during his retreat, which brought no danger for me but much for him." [...] (Thucydides) ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the head}} of {{household}} finds a suitable tree, he {{stands in front of}} it facing east. After throwing grain at the tree, he greets it with the words [...] "Good morning and happy Christmas Eve to you", makes the Sign of the Cross, says a prayer, and kisses the tree. He may also explain to the badnjak why it will be cut: [...] "I have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> to take to my home, to be my faithful helper to every progress and improvement, in the house, in the pen, in the field, and in every place." [...] He then cuts it slantwise on its eastern side, using an axe. Some men put gloves on before they start to cut the tree, and from then on never touch the badnjak with their bare hands. The tree should fall to the east, unhindered by surrounding trees. It must not be left half-cut, as then it will curse the house of the man. In some regions, if the tree is not cut down after the third blow of the axe, then it must be pulled and twisted until its trunk breaks. The resulting badnjak has a so-called [...] "beard", the part of the trunk at which it broke off {{from the base of the}} tree. In Šumadija, half of a circular loaf of bread is left on the stump, the other half being eaten on the way back home. In Zagarač, the stump is covered with moss or dry leaves, and it will be visited again in spring: the stump sprouting through the cover is an omen of good luck and prosperity.|$|E
