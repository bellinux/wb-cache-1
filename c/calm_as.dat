She apologises to everyone in Santosh’s home and says {{that she is not}} the one fit for him and his family. Santosh is worried seeing this but has no option rather than staying <b>calm</b> <b>as</b> even Subramaniam did not like Hasini.|$|E

Subramaniam realises his mistake and apologises to everyone saying that he always wanted to take care of his family members so well but had never thought that they are sacrificing a lot to make him happy.|$|E

25|$|Summoners are {{tasked with}} {{destroying}} Sin with a creature {{known as the}} Final Aeon, sacrificing themselves so that Spira can enjoy a peaceful period known as the Calm until Sin is reborn. Unbeknownst to most of Spira, the Final Aeon is always made from the fayth {{of one of the}} summoner's own guardians, and it is possessed by the spirit of Yu Yevon, Sin's creator, to be transformed into a new Sin after the previous Sin is destroyed. After the Final Aeon destroys the body or armor of the previous Sin, Yu Yevon possesses the Final Aeon and kills the summoner. The possessed Aeon's power is then used by Yu Yevon to create a new Sin, with Jecht being the current incarnation during Final Fantasy X. At the end of the game, the party must fight and destroy each aeon possessed by Yu Yevon in order to draw him out into the open so that he can be destroyed, and thus Yu Yevon does not possess an aeon, leaving him unable to create a new Sin. This final death of Sin marks the beginning of the Eternal <b>Calm,</b> <b>as</b> Spira is freed from its long cycle of death and destruction.|$|E
25|$|At {{the formal}} {{presentation}} of the peace proposal by Krishna in the Kuru Mahasabha, at the court of Hastinapur, Krishna asked Duryodhana to return Indraprastha to the Pandavas and restore the status quo; or, if not, give over at least five villages, {{one for each of}} the Pandavas. Duryodhana said he would not give land even as much as tip of a needle to the Pandavas. Krishna's peace proposals were ignored & dismissed, and Duryodhana publicly ordered his soldiers, even after the warnings from all the elders, to arrest Krishna. Krishna laughed and displayed his divine form, radiating intense light. Lord Krishna cursed Duryodhana that his downfall was certain {{at the hands of the}} one who was sworn to tear off his thigh, to the shock of the blind king, who tried to pacify the Lord with as words to <b>calm</b> <b>as</b> he could find. His peace mission utterly insulted by Duryodhana, Krishna returned to the Pandava camp at Upaplavya to inform the Pandavas that the only course left to uphold the principles of virtue and righteousness was inevitable - war. During the course of his return, Krishna met Karna, Kunti's firstborn(before Yudhishthira) and requested him to help his brothers & fight on the side of dharma. However, being helped by Duryodhana, Karna said to Krishna that he would battle against Pandavas as he had a debt to pay.|$|E

As <b>calm</b> <b>as</b> Sibelius had appeared on the stage, after his part was over he came up stairs and sank into a chair in one of the dressing rooms and was very much overcome.

500|$|From {{the late}} 1360s, Louis {{suffered}} from a skin disease with symptoms similar to leprosy. Thereafter he became even more zealous and dedicated more time to praying and religious contemplation. After his meeting with Louis in 1372, the papal legate, John de Cardailhac, stated: [...] "I call God as my witness that I {{have never seen a}} monarch more majestic and more [...] or one who desires peace and <b>calm</b> <b>as</b> much as he." [...] He also changed the priorities of his foreign policy and began neglecting the Balkan states. Casimir III of Poland and Louis signed a treaty against Emperor Charles IV in Buda in February 1369. At their next meeting in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) in September, Albert I of Bavaria, and Rupert I of the Palatinate joined their coalition against the emperor and the Habsburgs. However, Emperor Charles IV persuaded the two Wittelsbachs (Albert I and Rupert I) to break off the coalition in September 1370.|$|E
500|$|L'Héritier {{submitted}} {{his sword}} to Butterfield in surrender {{and it was}} presented to the dying Hood, who accepted it before expiring. At 22:50 Jason arrived and Stirling took charge of removing prisoners from Hercule and began the long process of extricating the two battered ships of the line from the dangerous Raz de Sein channel. Losses on the French ship were not accurately recorded {{in the aftermath of the}} action, but some accounts suggested they were as high as 400 although a more realistic estimate of 290 casualties was made by the surviving French officers. British losses amounted to three officers and 19 men killed, eight men missing (believed to have drowned after falling overboard resisting L'Héritier's boarding attempts) and another 60 wounded. [...] The weather was fortunately <b>calm,</b> <b>as</b> neither Mars nor Hercule were in a condition to survive a storm, and with great care Hercule was brought into Plymouth on 27 April and repairs were begun with the intention of restoring the ship to active service condition. The cost of these repairs totaled £12,500 (the equivalent of £ as of [...] ), but HMS Hercule was ultimately commissioned into the Royal Navy and served until 1810.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before 16:00, Hipper's force {{encountered}} the six ships of Vice Admiral Beatty's 1st and 2nd battlecruiser squadrons. The German ships {{were the first}} to open fire, at a range of approximately 15,000 yards (14,000m). When the British ships began returning fire, confusion amongst the British battlecruisers resulted in Moltke being engaged by both New Zealand and Tiger. The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile past the German battlecruisers. Due to errors in British communication, Derfflinger was unengaged during the first 10 minutes of the battle. Derfflingers gunnery officer, Korvettenkapitän Georg von Hase later remarked [...] "By some mistake we were being left out. I laughed grimly and now I began to engage our enemy with complete <b>calm,</b> <b>as</b> at gun practice, and with continually increasing accuracy." [...] At 17:03, the British battlecruiser [...] exploded after 15 minutes of gunfire from Von der Tann. Shortly thereafter the second half of Beatty's force, the four s of the 5th Battle Squadron, came into range and began firing at Von der Tann and Moltke.|$|E

500|$|Blackburn {{directed}} the 2008 film Donkey Punch, which he co-wrote with David Bloom. His total {{budget for the}} film was £1 million. Blackburn's production team went through a casting process which took seven months; the film stars Nichola Burley, Tom Burke, Jaime Winstone and Julian Morris. He shot the film in South Africa, over 24 days. Film shooting for Donkey Punch began in March 2007; during production Blackburn dealt with actors afflicted by hypothermia and tidal surges on location. In an interview with Total Film, Blackburn commented, [...] "I think Donkey Punch is an extreme thriller or an extreme reality-based thriller. The {{whole point of the}} film is it's grounded in reality." [...] Blackburn wrote that he made [...] Donkey Punch, [...] "to try to push the genre." [...] Donkey Punch received mixed reviews; the film obtained a rating of 50% based on 51 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes, and a score of 43 out of 100 at Metacritic. The Philadelphia Inquirer compared Blackburn's work to films including filmmaker Peter Berg's Very Bad Things and director Philip Noyce's Dead Calm, and wrote, [...] "Donkey Punch offers a gripping mix of sexual heat and nasty menace." [...] The Los Angeles Times additionally compared Blackburn's work to Dead <b>Calm</b> <b>as</b> well as director Roman Polanski's Knife in the Water, and concluded, Donkey Punch isn't without a certain power as it gleefully turns its careless hedonists into caged, paranoid rats." [...] The film was Blackburn's first work to be shown at the Sundance Film Festival, where it received a positive reception from the audience in attendance.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{displays}} news anchor {{reports about the}} Earth on course {{to pass through the}} tail of a comet named Eurydice, as well as displaying a worldwide panic. The rest of the video then is presented {{through the use of a}} handheld video camera. Grande is in a Fiat car as the passenger, with her boyfriend (played by Matt Bennett), who is recording. They are stuck in traffic as they try to leave the city, implied to be Los Angeles, California. While everyone around them is panicking, Grande seems to be <b>calm</b> <b>as</b> she wants to get a closer look at the comet. Impatient, she leaves the car while Bennett tries to stop her, and then follows. They make their way through the crowds, but are stopped by the police who are barricading the street. Meanwhile, the comet erupts in the sky and begins to crash to the ground as the song starts. Grande manages to get through but Bennett is unable to, so he goes through an open ambulance and manages to catch up with her in an alleyway with stairs leading up into an apartment complex. Ariana notices the comet in the sky. The two enter a home of a frightened family and try to leave through the other door, only for the comet to crash into the building, nearly killing both of them. Frightened, the two continue on and enter a room filled with television screens of the comet and an old man sitting at a desk. As the former two of them try to leave, the latter tries to stop them, but they knock him to the ground, and all the screens change to the same countdown timer. [...] Grande and Bennett eventually make their way up the rooftop after subduing the old man again, who had caught up with them. The camera is then set down, and shows the two of them embracing each other one last time until the comet crashes down, destroys everything and leads the Earth to an end.|$|E
500|$|About {{four days}} in advance of a typical {{tropical}} cyclone, an ocean [...] of [...] in height will roll in about every 10 seconds, moving towards the coast {{from the direction of}} the tropical cyclone's location. [...] The ocean swell will slowly increase in height and frequency the closer a tropical cyclone gets to land. [...] Two days in advance of the center's passage, winds go <b>calm</b> <b>as</b> the tropical cyclone interrupts the environmental wind flow. [...] Within 36 hours of the center passage, the pressure begins to fall and a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches from the cyclone's direction. [...] Within 24 hours of the closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as the bar of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. [...] Within 18 hours of the center's approach, squally weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. [...] Winds increase within 12 hours of the center's approach, occasionally reaching hurricane force. [...] The ocean's surface becomes whipped with foam. [...] Small items begin flying in the wind. [...] Within 6 hours of the center's arrival, rain becomes continuous and the storm surge begins to come inland. [...] Within an hour of the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. [...] When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the eye moves overhead. [...] At this point, the pressure ceases to drop as the lowest pressure within the storm's center is reached. [...] This is also when the peak depth of the storm surge occurs. [...] Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. [...] The storm surge retreats as the pressure suddenly rises in the wake of its center. [...] One day after the center's passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. [...] By 36 hours after the center's passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off.|$|E
