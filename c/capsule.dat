40|$|Background Fermentation using {{encapsulated}} yeast {{leads to}} more robust ethanol production from lignocellulose hydrolyzates. Encapsulated yeast is much more tolerant to inhibitors present in hydrolyzates, and fermentation is faster due to increased total cell density. For industrial applications, <b>capsules</b> must be made robust enough to endure long periods and numerous cultivations without breaking. Results Liquid core alginatechitosanalginate (ACA) <b>capsules</b> containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae were produced by the liquid-droplet-forming method and treated with hydrolyzed 3 -aminopropyltrietoxysilane (hAPTES) forming very glossy <b>capsules.</b> <b>Capsules</b> produced with 3. 0 % hAPTES showed the best mechanical robustness but no ethanol could be produced in dilute-acid spruce hydrolyzate using these <b>capsules.</b> Untreated ACA <b>capsules</b> gave the highest ethanol production but demonstrated poor mechanical robustness. 25 % of the ACA <b>capsules</b> ruptured within 6 h in the shear test. <b>Capsules</b> treated with 1. 5 % hAPTES were significantly stronger, since only 02 % of these <b>capsules</b> broke. Moreover, the ethanol production in the fifth consecutive cultivation in lignocellulose hydrolyzate was nearly as high as for untreated ACA <b>capsules.</b> Conclusion The mechanical robustness of ACA <b>capsules</b> can be easily improved by treating the <b>capsules</b> with hAPTES. ACA <b>capsules</b> treated with 1. 5 % hAPTES showed excellent mechanical robustness and a similar ethanol production profile to untreated ACA <b>capsules...</b>|$|R

5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model <b>capsule</b> to suddenly appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the <b>capsule</b> into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the <b>capsule</b> falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the <b>capsule</b> floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the <b>capsule</b> with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E

40|$|Hollow <b>capsules</b> can be {{prepared}} in a single stage by the interfacial complexation of methylcellulose (MC) with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) or tannic acid (TA) via hydrogen bonding in aqueous solutions.

5|$|Dr. Mario is {{a falling}} block tile-matching video {{game in which}} Mario assumes {{the role of a}} doctor, tossing two-colored medical {{capsules}} into a medicine bottle representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each <b>capsule</b> as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more <b>capsule</b> halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining <b>capsule</b> halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or <b>capsule</b> will fall {{to the bottom of the}} playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio is sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.|$|E

40|$|Grafting of {{encapsulated}} {{living cells}} {{has the potential}} to cure a wide variety of diseases. Large-scale application of the technique, however, is hampered by insufficient biocompatibility of the <b>capsules.</b> A major factor in the biocompatibility of <b>capsules</b> is inadequate covering of the inflammatory poly-L-lysine (PLL) on the capsules' surface. In the present study, we investigate whether tissue responses against alginate-PLL <b>capsules</b> can be reduced by crosslinking the surface of the <b>capsules</b> with heparin or polyacrylic acid. Our transplant study in rats shows a tissue response composed of fibroblasts and macrophages on alginate-PLL-alginate and alginate-PLL-heparin <b>capsules</b> that was completely absent on alginate-PLL-polyacrylic acid <b>capsules.</b> Atomic force microscopy analyses of the <b>capsules</b> demonstrates that the improved biocompatibility of alginate-PLL-capsules by polyacrylic acid coating should not only be explained by a more adequate binding of PLL but also by the induction of a smoother surface. This study shows {{for the first time that}} biologic responses against <b>capsules</b> can be successfully deleted by chemically crosslinking biocompatible molecules on the surface of alginate-PLL <b>capsules.</b> (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{obtain a}} {{formulation}} with high bioavailability through {{evaluation of the}} stability of three types of Xuesaitong <b>capsules</b> in the stomachs and intestines of rats. We compared {{the stability of the}} Panax notoginsenoside R 1 as well as the ginsenosides Rg 1, Rb 1, Re, and Rd in different formulations. Methods: Artificial stomach fluid (ASF) and artificial intestinal fluid (AIF) were prepared. Stability of three types of Xuesaitong <b>capsules</b> was examined for 4  h in stomachs and 24  h in intestines. Samples were analyzed at different times by high-performance liquid chromatography. Percent content of NGR 1, GRg 1, GRb 1, GRe, and GRd at different times was calculated. Results: Hard <b>capsules</b> incubated in ASF disintegrated within 2 – 3  min, whereas soft <b>capsules</b> disintegrated within 7 – 8  min. Components in hard <b>capsules</b> were dissolved rapidly in water, with content of each compound reaching 90 % in 5  min, and degradation of each compound reaching 30 – 50 % after incubation for 240  min. Dissolution and degradation of each component in soft <b>capsules</b> with a water-soluble base tended to balance at 30 – 90  min. Contents in soft <b>capsules</b> with a lipid-soluble base showed slow dissolution after ASF incubation for 120  min. Five saponins in identical types of <b>capsules</b> incubated in ASF had similar stability curves. Contents of hard <b>capsules</b> and soft <b>capsules</b> with a water-soluble base degraded rapidly within 30  min and reached a plateau when Xuesaitong <b>capsules</b> were incubated in AIF. Conclusions: Contents of <b>capsules</b> with a lipid-soluble base degraded slower than the other two types of <b>capsules</b> incubated in ASF and AIF, suggesting that they may have better bioavailability...|$|R
