50|$|The CL {{can take}} {{nearly all the}} Leica M lenses. Exception are some lenses that {{protrude}} deep into the body and could hurt the meter arm, these include: 15mm/8 Hologon, 21mm/4 Super Angulon, 28mm/2.8 Elmarits before serial number 2314921. The eyed lenses, including the M3 wide-angle lenses, the 135mm/2.8 Elmarit, and the 50mm/2 Dual Range Summicron, cannot be mounted either because they are incompatible with the body shape. The 90mm/2 Summicron and 135mm/4 Tele-Elmar are incompatible too. The collapsible lenses can be mounted but they must not be fully collapsed, and Leitz advised {{to stick to the}} barrel an adhesive strip of adequate width, to limit the <b>collapsing</b> <b>movement.</b> Another limitation is that the rangefinder is only coupled until 0.8m.|$|E

40|$|Purpose—To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that females with patellofemoral pain (PFP) have increased hip adduction, hip medial rotation, and knee valgus (medial collapse) during the stance phase of gait. Methods—Twenty subjects with PFP and 20 pain-free subjects participated. Subjects underwent 3 -dimensional motion analysis during free speed and fast speed walking. Hip frontal and transverse plane angles and knee frontal plane angles were calculated at 2 time points (peak knee extensor moment (PkMOM), and maximum knee extension/hyperextension angle (MxExt)) and averaged over 3 trials. Within each walking task, Student’s t-tests compared group differences in all variables. A post-hoc analysis was performed comparing a subgroup of 4 PFP subjects (those whose pain level was above 30 / 100) to pain-free subjects. Results—Initially, there were no group differences during free speed walking. During fast speed walking, subjects with PFP had less hip adduction at PkMOM and greater hip adduction at MxExt. The subgroup of PFP subjects had greater hip adduction at PkMOM and greater knee valgus at MxExt during free speed walking and greater hip adduction and knee valgus at MxExt during fast speed walking. Conclusions—During low-level tasks, frontal plane components of medial collapse were present at the hip and knee in a subgroup of PFP subjects with higher pain levels. Symptom behavior may be important in identifying individuals with medial <b>collapse</b> <b>movement</b> impairments...|$|R

25|$|Large volcano-associated debris flows {{known as}} lahars {{pose a threat}} to {{populated}} areas downstream from glaciated volcanoes. Although lahars are typically associated with the effects of volcanic eruptions, they can occur whenever conditions allow <b>collapse</b> and <b>movement</b> of mud originating from existing volcanic ash deposits. Melting snow and ice, intense rainfall or the breakout of a summit crater lake can all generate lahars. Landslides at Mount Meager may also be indirectly related to climate change. Several tension cracks extend up to the summit, and as global warming causes glaciers to melt, the meltwater reaches deep into the massif. It then flows along the ruptured surfaces making these landslide zones.|$|R
50|$|During {{the latter}} half of the nineteenth century, the army either failed to protect the central {{government}} or directly caused the government's <b>collapse.</b> Rural insurgent <b>movements</b> led by piquets and cacos limited the central government's authority in outlying areas.

50|$|As befits a 'gateway town' to {{the world}} {{heritage}} site, the coastal cliffs either side of Seaton have long been of interest to geologists. To the East are the characteristically red-coloured cliffs of Triassic age rocks assigned to the Branscombe Mudstone Formation, capped by younger rocks (Cretaceous) of the Upper Greensand Formation and finally by chalk. The Seaton Fault, which is visible at Seaton Hole at {{the western end of}} the beach, is responsible for the presence of significant chalk cliffs extending to Beer Head. In common with much of this coast the cliffs in this area are prone to landslip and <b>collapse,</b> such <b>movement</b> restricting coastal development and presenting a hazard to those walking the coast.|$|R
30|$|We are {{presented}} with a 73 -year-old patient with previous arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and chronic bronchitis who is admitted in the ICU for septic shock secondary to anastomotic rupture in the postoperative of a colon disease. Thirty-two days later, he is extubated without vasoactive drugs. On the 35 th day he started having respiratory problems, fever and hypotension, needing intubation and vasoactive drugs. After a subclavian access, we suspected {{it to be a}} left pneumothorax. In the X-rays, both hemithorax bases were observed with an augment of density, mostly in the right lung. A Lung ultrasound was done in the parasternal line of the right lung and we observed pleural sliding with B lines pattern. It was not present in the left lung and {{we were not able to}} do the echocardiography because of window absence. TC confirmed the presence of anterior pneumothorax, and a thorax tube was inserted. The clinical situation did not improve. ECG demonstrated a new Q wave in the septal face and negative T in the lateral face. An echocardiography was done and moderate biventricular dysfunction, left ventricle dilated with dyskinetic movement were observed. We also noticed pericardial effusion with a dubious tamponade of the right ventricle, nonetheless this was dismissed because this <b>collapse</b> <b>movement</b> occurred in systole. There were mitral and tricuspid insufficiencies. The cava vein was dilated without variability. At a later time, another lung ultrasound was done where pleural sliding was observed in both hemithorax, with a B line pattern at the parasternal line. Pleural effusion and heterogenic consolidation were noticed at the decline parts of both lungs.|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis of 2008 / 9 was felt more acutely in Ireland relative to elsewhere and {{culminated in the}} international bailout in 2010. Given the economic collapse, Ireland provides an ideal case-study {{of the link between}} wealth <b>collapses</b> and <b>movements</b> in variables such as health and well-being. Using nationally-representative samples of older people collected before and during the crisis, we show that mean net assets fell by 45 percent between 2006 / 7 and 2012 / 13. In spite of this massive fall in wealth, measures of health and well-being remained broadly unchanged. However, expectations about future living standards became less optimistic. The results tend to support the findings of other recent studies that recessions do not have widespread negative effects on health and well-being...|$|R

50|$|Since the Great Depression, the {{treatment}} of Filipinos was particularly harsh, as they were considered the most inferior of the Asian race. As a result, acts of defiance such as striking, unionizing, or protesting were resolved with deportation back to the Philippines. Furthermore, around 6,000 Filipinos were unemployed in Hawaii, further reducing their collective bargaining power. Unlike the Japanese, most Filipinos still worked in the plantations, and without Pablo Manlapit, the labor <b>movement</b> <b>collapsed.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{subject matter}} of these notes refers to the Ultimate Strength Design of 2 -D steel framed {{structures}} and in particular {{to the analysis of}} the deformation state at collapse. The idea is based on the consideration that, if the structure at its collapse condition is subjected to an articulated movement, similar and concordant to the crisis motion, this will not change the stress state of the system. This motion is known once a single parameter is fixed, namely the displacement of a point or the rotation of a beam. When the collapse mechanism of the structure is already determined through any instrument of the Limit Analysis, a subsequent (k+ 1) plastic hinge can be arbitrarily fixed and assumed as the last developed one. It is therefore possible to solve the modified scheme through the rotation method and make a comparison in the verses between the known plastic moments and the rotations at the corresponding hinges. If the comparison is successful, {{in the sense that the}} checked verses are concordant, the selected hinge is actually the one formed as the last. On the contrary, the rotations resulting from an imprinted motion in the verse of <b>collapse</b> <b>movement</b> are algebraically added. If, for each hinge, the product between the plastic moment and the correspondent algebraic sum is made, this product has to be surely positive, due to the verses concordance. This can be translated in k+ 1 inequalities, with each one furnishing a lower limit for the parameter from which the articulated motion depends. Among these, the highest value is that one which makes all the inequalities to be simultaneously verified. The substitution of this value into the expressions for rotations permits to arrive to the simultaneous identifying of the last hinge and of the complete picture of deformations...|$|R
