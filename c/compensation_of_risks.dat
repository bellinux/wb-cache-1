40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the issues of}} providing the Universal telecommunications service in Latvia, {{taking into account the}} peculiarities of development of economics and telecommunications infrastructure. According {{to the demands of the}} European Union, the Latvian government has to establish the Universal telecommunications service – a minimum set of services of a definite quality which will be available to all users at an affordable price, irrespectively of their geographical location. Under the conditions of a liberalized market, the main task of every entrepreneur is decreasing of costs and increasing of revenues. Owing to this, it is quite natural that entrepreneurs aspire to offer their services to those customers and in those regions, where it would be profitable. An operator would not provide its services to economically disadvantageous customers, if it did not have the corresponding obligations to do so. Therefore it is very important to solve the question <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk,</b> which is involved in installation of new telephone lines in the underdeveloped regions of Latvia. In comparison with highly developed countries of the European Union, Latvia is characterized by a low penetration rate of telephone lines and varying penetration rates in urban and rural areas. Besides, a relatively large number of Latvian inhabitants are on the edge of poverty. Thus, introducing the Universal telecommunications service requires solving of many tasks and problems, which are formulated and examined in this work...|$|R

40|$|In {{his inaugural}} lecture, Niels Philipsen {{discusses}} the (potential) role of private {{actors in the}} regulation <b>of</b> work-related <b>risks,</b> such as industrial accidents and occupational diseases. Taking the economic analysis of regulation as a starting point, Philipsen argues that a ‘smart mix’ {{of public and private}} regulation is needed for an optimal prevention and <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> work-related <b>risks.</b> The advantages and disadvantages of various regulatory instruments are thusly highlighted. In the lecture’s second part, economic theory is confronted with some of the available empirical evidence. Do private actors really respond to shifts in regulation according to the predictions made in the theoretical law and economics literature? Philipsen addresses this question for three distinct groups of private actors: employees, employers and (liability) insurers. On the basis of a quick-scan of the literature, Philipsen concludes that there are still several unresolved questions concerning the coping behaviour of these private actors.

40|$|Direct and {{indirect}} standardization procedures aim at comparing differences in health or differences {{in health care}} expenditures between subgroups of the population after controlling for observable morbidity differences. There is a close analogy between this problem and the issue <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> adjustment in health insurance.

They are equivalent to the so-called conditional egalitarian mechanism in social choice. In general, they do not remove incentives for risk selection, even if the effect of non-morbidity variables is correctly taken into account. A method <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> adjustment based on direct standardization (as proposed for Ireland) does remove the incentives for risk selection, but {{at the cost of}} violating a neutrality condition, stating that insurers should receive the same premium subsidy for all members <b>of</b> the same <b>risk</b> group. Direct standardization is equivalent to the egalitarianequivalent (or proportional) mechanism in social choice. The conflict between removing incentives for risk selection and neutrality is unavoidable if the health expenditure function is not additively separable in the morbidity and efficiency variables. ...|$|R

So, the myocardial tissue-specific knockdown mouse models were needed for the investigations of renalase. To establish the mouse models, intramyocardial injection of siRNAs targeting renalase was performed in mice. The wild distribution and high transfection efficiency of the siRNAs were approved. And the renalase expression was efficiently suppressed in myocardial tissue. Compared with the high cost, time consumption, and genetic <b>compensation</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the Cre/loxP technology, RNA interference (RNAi) technology is much cheaper and less time-consuming. Among the RNAi technologies, injection of siRNAs is safer than virus.

Altogether, intramyocardial injection of siRNAs targeting renalase is an economical, safe, and efficient method to establish myocardial tissue-specific renalase knockdown mouse models...|$|R

We find support for greater female risk aversion as one contributing factor. Female executives hold significantly lower equity incentives and demand larger salary premiums for bearing a given level <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>risk.</b> These results suggest that females’ risk aversion contributes to the observed lower pay levels through its effect on ex ante compensation structures. We also find evidence {{that the lack of}} gender diversity on corporate boards affects the size of the gaps.

Results We extracted 3270 mesothelioma cases with occupational origins from the ReNaM, matching them with 1625 subjects in INAIL (49. 7 %); 91. 2 % (1, 482) of the claims received <b>compensation.</b> The <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> not seeking <b>compensation</b> is significantly higher for women and the elderly.
