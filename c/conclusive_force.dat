60|$|In one sense, indeed, {{it may be}} said that, given Malthus on the {{one hand}} and the Lamarckian {{evolutionism}} on the other, some great man somewhere must sooner or later, almost of necessity, have combined the two, and hit out the doctrine of natural selection as we actually know it. Quite so; but then the point is just this: Darwin was the great man in question; he did the work which in the very essence of things some such great man was naturally and inevitably predestined to do. You can always easily manage to get on without any particular great man, provided, of course, you have ready to hand another equally able great man by whom to replace him in the scheme of existence. But how many ordinary naturalists possess the width of mind and universality of interest which would prompt them to read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest a politico-economical treatise of the calibre of Malthus? How many, having done so, have the keenness of vision to perceive the ensuing biological implications? How many, having seen them, have the skill and the patience to work up the infinite chaos of botanical and zoological detail into the far-reaching generalisations of the 'Origin of Species'? Merely to have caught at the grand idea is in itself no small achievement; others did so and deserve all honour for their insight; but to flesh it out with all the minute care and <b>conclusive</b> <b>force</b> of Darwin's masterpiece is a thousand times a greater and nobler monument of human endeavour.|$|E

40|$|For sprint events {{longer than}} 100 m, {{more than half}} the race is run on the bend, yet bend sprinting has {{received}} little attention in biomechanics literature. The aim of this thesis was to understand the effect of the bend on maximal effort sprint performance and technique, using bend radii and surfaces typical of outdoor competition. Three empirical studies were undertaken with experienced bend sprinters. Initial 3 D kinematics investigations revealed an approximately 5 % velocity decrease on the bend compared to the straight. However, step characteristic changes contributing to this reduction were different for the left and right steps. For the left step there were significant decreases in step frequency (p < 0. 05), due to increased ground contact time, which agreed with previously proposed theoretical models. For the right step, however, a significantly reduced flight time resulted in a significant reduction in step length (p < 0. 05). Maintaining step length and an ‘active touchdown’ were closely related to an athlete’s ability to better maintain straight line velocity on the bend. Generally, velocity decreased as bend radius decreased, with mean differences of up to 2. 3 % between lanes 8 and 2. However, changes to athletes’ technique due to different lanes were not <b>conclusive.</b> Ground reaction <b>forces</b> revealed between-limb differences during bend sprinting. Furthermore, frontal plane forces were up to 2. 6 times larger on the bend than on the straight. Overall, asymmetries were identified between left and right steps for several performance, technique and force variables, suggesting that bend sprinting induces different functional roles between left and right legs, with the left step contributing more to turning to remain on the bend trajectory. The differences in kinematic and kinetic characteristics between the bend and straight, and between-limb asymmetries mean that athletes should apply the principle of specificity to bend sprinting training and conditioning, without sacrificing straight line technique.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we develop}} {{a theory of}} {{abstract}} argumentation systems. An abstract argumentation system {{is a collection of}} “defeasible proofs”, called arguments, that is partially ordered by a relation expressing the difference in <b>conclusive</b> <b>force.</b> The prefix “abstract” indicates that the theory is concerned neither with a specification of the underlying language, nor with the development of a subtheory that explains the partial order. An unstructured language, without logical connectives such as negation, makes arguments not (pairwise) inconsistent, but (groupwise) incompatible. Incompatibility and difference in <b>conclusive</b> <b>force</b> cause defeat among arguments. The aim of the theory is to find out which arguments eventually emerge undefeated. These arguments are considered to be in force. Several results are established. The main result is that arguments that are in force are precisely those that are in the limit of a so-called complete argumentation sequence...|$|E
