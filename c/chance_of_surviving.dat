5|$|As {{many more}} {{individuals}} of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, {{there is a}} frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, {{will have a better}} <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving,</b> and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have a 43% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> {{their first}} year, {{and the annual}} {{survival}} rate of adults is about 80%. Choughs generally have a lifespan of about seven years, although an age of 17years has been recorded. The temperature and rainfall in the months preceding breeding correlates {{with the number of}} young fledging each year and their survival rate. Chicks fledging under good conditions are more likely to survive to breeding age, and have longer breeding lives than those fledging under poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|The algae {{benefit from}} {{a safe place to}} live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp, stress on the coral often drives them to eject the algae. Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E

50|$|The defendant, Dr Scott, misdiagnosed negligently the plaintiff's {{malignant}} cancer, stating {{it to be}} benign. This had {{the effect}} of delaying Mr Gregg's treatment by nine months, reducing his <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> ten years from 42% to 25%.|$|R
5|$|The {{day after}} the crash, Onassis's father and {{stepmother}} arrived from New York at the hospital where Onassis was being treated. The couple were accompanied by an American neurosurgeon. Onassis's mother arrived from Switzerland with her husband, Stavros Niarchos. Aristotle had also flown the English neurosurgeon Alan Richardson from London to Athens, but Richardson later told Onassis that Alexander had no <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> his injuries. Aristotle Onassis considered having his son's body cryogenically frozen with the Life Extension Society, but was persuaded against it, and it was embalmed by Desmond Henley. Alexander Onassis was buried next to the chapel on his father's private Ionian island of Skorpios.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} moth exists in both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the industrial revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths a better <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, {{nearly all of the}} moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on {{peppered moth}} evolution.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Christian Selmer was impeached on 27 February; {{his cabinet}} members {{followed}} one by one, the last being impeached on 1 April. On 11 March, Selmer resigned. Two acting Prime Ministers {{were drawn from}} his cabinet; Ole Bachke from 11 to 29 March and Niels Mathias Rye from 29 March to 3 April. Then, a new cabinet led by Selmer's former Minister of Finance Christian Homann Schweigaard was formed, but in reality it stood no <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> as it faced the Liberal-dominated Parliament, whose means of pressuring the executive branch had been strengthened following the Impeachment trial. In June, as Schweigaard entered his last month as Prime Minister, the King summoned mathematics professor Ole Jacob Broch to form a compromise cabinet, but this failed owing to Conservative opposition, spearheaded by up-and-coming politician Emil Stang. Broch gave up on 22 June, and Johan Sverdrup became Prime Minister on 26 June. In light of this change in circumstances, the case against Hol had been annulled by Royal Resolution earlier on 6 June.|$|E
25|$|Pumpkin {{chunking}} is {{a competitive}} {{activity in which}} teams build various mechanical devices designed to throw a pumpkin as far as possible. Catapults, trebuchets, ballistas and air cannons {{are the most common}} mechanisms.

50|$|In biology, exogamy more {{generally}} {{refers to the}} mating of individuals who are relatively less related genetically: that is, outbreeding as opposed to inbreeding. This benefits the offspring as it {{reduces the risk of}} the offspring inheriting two copies of a defective gene. Increasing the genetic diversity of the offspring is thought to improve their <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> to reproduce themselves.|$|R
5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at {{seven to eight}} years old, and males at seven to 10 years. The {{beginning}} of a female's ovulation is {{a signal to the}} males that she is ready to mate. During ovulation, the skin of the female's anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. The swelling makes it difficult to move and increases the female's chance of microbial or parasitic infection. Females with more swollen anogenital areas reproduce while younger, produce more offspring per year, and those offspring have a better <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving.</b> These females also attract more males, {{and are more likely to}} cause aggressive fights between them. Olive baboons tend to mate promiscuously. A male forms a mating consortship with an estrous female, staying close to and copulating with her. Males guard their partner against any other male trying to mate with her. Unless a female is in a multiday consortship, she often copulates with more than one male each day. Multiple copulations are not necessary for reproduction, but may function to make the actual paternity of the female's offspring ambiguous. This lack of paternal certainty could help reduce the occurrence of infanticide. Occasionally, male olive baboons monopolize a female for her entire period of probable conception. The male protects his female from being mated by other males during consortship.|$|E
25|$|A 1990 {{study of}} life {{expectancy}} of teenagers in Harlem reported that 15-year-old girls in Harlem had a 65% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> to age 65, {{about the same as}} women in India. Fifteen-year-old men in Harlem, on the other hand, had a 37% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> to age 65, about the same as men in Angola. Infectious diseases and diseases of the circulatory system were to blame, with a variety of contributing factors, including consumption of the deep-fried foods traditional to the South, which may contribute to heart disease.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, eight whaling {{ships were}} trapped in an Arctic ice field {{surrounding}} Point Barrow, the northernmost point of Alaska. Trapped by ice, the harsh environment, and a dwindling food supply, the whalers had little <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{management}} analyst {{from the}} University of Toronto Rotman School of Management, Joe D’Cruz, indicated in July 2016 that the outstanding unpaid consultants {{and lack of}} airport deposits indicated that the company may be underfunded for start-up.

25|$|Subsociality is a {{trade-off}} for the female, as {{the energy and}} time that is exerted into caring for her young is rewarded by giving them a much greater <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> and carrying on her genetic lineage.

25|$|However, {{problems}} were experienced in converting the Me 328 and Heinrich Himmler wanted {{to cancel the}} project. Otto Skorzeny, who had been investigating {{the possibility of using}} manned torpedoes against Allied shipping, was briefed by Hitler to revive the project, and he contacted famous test pilot Hanna Reitsch. The Fi 103 was reappraised and since it seemed to offer the pilot a slim <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving,</b> it was adopted for the project.|$|E
25|$|On 20 September 2010, Hinch {{confirmed}} the liver cancer diagnosis, {{and said that}} he expected to undergo surgery to remove a third of his liver, and that this would take him off-air for several weeks.

On 4 November 2010, Hinch told his listeners that his doctors had told him that without a liver transplant, his maximum survival would be 12 months.|$|E
5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and preventative measures {{that people can}} take to increase the <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|R
50|$|This event usually {{occurs when}} a few organisms end up in new, often distant areas or when {{environmental}} changes cause several extinctions, opening up ecological niches for the survivors. The events that cause these species to originally separate from each other over distant areas may still allow both of the species to have equal <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving,</b> reproducing, and even evolving to better suit their environments while still being two distinct species.|$|R
5000|$|Eugene Talmadge's {{supporters}} {{had been}} unsure <b>of</b> his <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> {{until he was}} sworn in, so they did some research into the state constitution and concluded that if he died, the Georgia General Assembly would choose between the second- and third-place finishers.

25|$|The {{prognosis}} following {{liver transplant}} is variable, depending on overall health, technical {{success of the}} surgery, and the underlying disease process affecting the liver. There is no exact model to predict survival rates; those with transplant have a 58% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> 15 years. Failure of the new liver occurs in 10% to 15% of all cases. These percentages are contributed to by many complications. Early graft failure is probably due to preexisting disease of the donated organ. Others include technical flaws during surgery such as revascularization {{that may lead to}} a nonfunctioning graft.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the common}} skate is {{long-lived}} and slow to mature, {{it is difficult}} for it to repopulate quickly. Coupled with overfishing, this means that the common skate's population has drastically decreased and it is likely it will disappear entirely unless more is done to preserve it. It is strictly protected within the EU, making it illegal for commercial fishers to actively fish for it or keep it if accidentally landed. Like other elasmobranchs, it is believed to have a good <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> if released after being caught.|$|E
25|$|Operation Nest Egg is a {{programme}} {{run by the}} BNZ Save the Kiwi Trust—a {{partnership between}} the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. Kiwi eggs and chicks are removed from the wild and hatched and/or raised in captivity until big enough to fend for themselves—usually when they weigh around 1200grams (42ounces). They are {{then returned to the}} wild. An Operation Nest Egg bird has a 65% <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> to adulthood—compared to just 5% for wild-hatched and raised chicks. The tool is used on all kiwi species except little spotted kiwi.|$|E

50|$|The Champions League had {{a bitter}} outcome for Real Sociedad. The first two matches were fairly balanced, but late goals in both games meant being bottom right before a double {{confrontation}} with Manchester United. As expected, Real Sociedad was comprehensively outplayed in both matches against the Red Devils. However, they only conceded one goal, in Manchester.

25|$|In Darwin's {{theory of}} natural selection, more organisms are {{produced}} than can survive. Some have variations that {{give them a}} competitive advantage, {{and they have the}} best <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> and procreating. The main element lacking in the theory was any mechanism that would allow organisms to pass on these favorable variations. Lacking such a mechanism, the theory of evolution faced competition from theories such as neo-Lamarckism, in which the environment acted directly on organisms, changing their structures. Darwin did not know that the monk Gregor Mendel was already working on experiments that would explain inheritance in terms of units of heredity that we now call genes.|$|E
25|$|In brachytherapy, {{radiation}} {{sources are}} precisely placed {{directly at the}} site of the cancerous tumour. This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area – exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over external beam radiation therapy – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues. A course of brachytherapy can often be completed in less time than other radiation therapy techniques. This can help reduce the <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiation therapy dose.|$|E
25|$|In China many {{individuals}} and criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking are increasingly arming themselves with automatic weapons and grenades {{to protect their}} drug shipments from theft by rival organizations. Many firefights occur along the Burma–China border, where larger drug shipments are more prevalent. Traffickers also arm themselves to avoid being captured by the police, and some smugglers are better armed than the local police forces. Furthermore, many traffickers believe they have a better <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>surviving</b> a firefight than the outcome of any legal proceedings. In China, sentencing for drug trafficking could include capital punishment. For example, the seizure of 50grams or more of heroin or crystal methamphetamine {{could result in the}} use of the death penalty by the Government.|$|E
