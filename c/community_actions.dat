While recruiting, Newton sought to educate those around him about the legality of self-defense. One of the reasons, he argued, why black people continued to be persecuted was their lack of knowledge of the social institutions that could be made to work in their favor. In Newton's autobiography Revolutionary Suicide, he writes, [...] "Before I took Criminal Evidence in school, I had no idea what my rights were." [...] Newton also wrote in his autobiography, [...] "I tried to transform many of the so-called criminal activities going on in the street into something political, although this had to be done gradually." [...] He attempted to channel these [...] "daily activities for survival" [...] into significant <b>community</b> <b>actions.</b> Eventually, however, the illicit activities of a few members would be superimposed on the social program work performed by the Panthers, and this mischaracterization would lose them support in both the white and black communities.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Purpose: Mapping Our Voices for Equality (MOVE) is {{a program}} that targets {{communities}} disproportionately affected by tobacco and obesity and uses Digital Storytelling to promote healthier neighborhoods. During 2011 - 2012, MOVE hosted community forums that brought community members, leaders, and policymakers together to discuss policies and problems highlighted by local story producers. The goals of the community forums were to increase community members' understanding of health disparities and inequities, mobilize members, and advocate for policy changes. The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of MOVE's digital stories on forum attendees and to assess if any <b>community</b> <b>actions</b> and policy changes occurred {{as a result of}} the forums. Methods: A total of four community forums were hosted in King County, WA. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with community leaders and policymakers (n= 11) in attendance and open-ended surveys were collected from community members (n= 38). Structured observations of each forum were recorded and debriefs with MOVE staff were conducted. Interviews and surveys assessed attendees' reactions to MOVE's digital stories. <b>Community</b> <b>actions</b> and policy changes resulting from the forums were documented. Results: Forum attendees perceived MOVE's digital stories as authentic. Many felt the stories enriched their understanding of health disparities and related a fresh perspective on health topics not typically captured in media. All four community forums resulted in <b>community</b> <b>action(s)</b> and/or policy change(s) around topics highlighted by MOVE's digital stories. Examples of <b>community</b> <b>actions</b> include the mailing of 250 + postcards from local Latinos to Washington legislators in favor of tobacco quitline services and the initiation of plans for a mobile grocer to locate in a neighborhood with limited healthy food access. Examples of policy changes include the restoration of operating hours slated to be cut from a community center, and planning to pilot new school lunch policies at a local Elementary school. Conclusion: Findings indicate that MOVE's Digital Stories were informative and inspiring to policymakers, community leaders, and other community members in attendance. Concrete <b>community</b> <b>actions</b> and policy changes proceeding MOVE's forums suggest that Digital Stories may be a potentially effective media tool for accomplishing positive community change...|$|E
30|$|<b>Community</b> <b>actions</b> {{as well as}} {{external}} {{interventions in}} advance of any major hazard are both necessary to minimize the impact of drought and other climate-related shocks. During the workshop, the participants in each study site {{were asked to identify}} <b>community</b> <b>actions</b> as well as external assistance that will enhance their future preparedness to reduce their vulnerability. To reduce vulnerability to future drought, the participants suggested expansion of cultivated land, off-season farming, small ruminant husbandry, application of fertilizers, adoption of improved and drought-tolerant crop varieties, and reclamation of degraded land. From these suggested <b>community</b> <b>actions,</b> livelihood diversification in forms of off-season farming and investment in livestock (mainly small ruminant fattening) were viewed by the respondents as the promising options to reduce their vulnerability to future climatic shocks. These options (off-season farming and small ruminant fattening) are gender-differentiated as they are mainly women’s activities in many agro-pastoral communities in West African Sahel (Saqalli 2008). The critical role of women in reducing vulnerability to drought and other shocks can partly be explained by the exodus of many young men from pastoral and agro-pastoral communities into urban centres leaving women and elderly men behind (Saqalli 2008). However, young pastoral and agro-pastoral men in urban centres contribute to the rural economy through remittances to their households (Saqalli 2008).|$|E
