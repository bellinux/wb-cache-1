The major {{regulatory}} protein in carbon repression in Aspergillus nidulans is <b>CreA.</b> Strains constitutively over-expressing <b>creA</b> show normal responses to carbon repression, indicating that auto-regulation of <b>creA</b> {{is not essential}} for CreA-mediated regulation. In these strains, high levels of <b>CreA</b> are present whether cells are grown in repressing or derepressing conditions, indicating large-scale degradation of <b>CreA</b> does not play a key role. <b>CreA</b> {{is located in the}} nucleus and cytoplasm in cells when grown in either repressing or derepressing conditions, and absence of CreB, CreD or AcrB does not affect either the localisation or amount of <b>CreA.</b> Therefore, <b>CreA</b> must require some modification or interaction to act as a repressor. Deletion analysis indicates that a region of <b>CreA</b> thought to be important for repression in Trichoderma reesei and Sclerotina sclerotiorum <b>CreA</b> homologues is not critical for function in Aspergillus nidulans.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, we cloned a {{putative}} <b>creA</b> gene from A. cellulolyticus {{that is highly}} similar to the <b>creA</b> genes of other filamentous fungi and then isolated a recombinant strain in which the <b>creA</b> gene was disrupted. The length of the homologous region was important for gene disruption.

The production of cellulase and xylanase by the <b>creA</b> disruptant was higher than that of the control strain at both the enzyme and transcription level. Furthermore, the <b>creA</b> disruptant produced cellulase and xylanase in the presence of glucose.

30|$|Acremonium cellulolyticus is one {{of several}} fungi that offer promise as an {{alternative}} to Trichoderma reesei for use in industrial cellulase production. However, the mechanism of cellulase production has not been studied at the molecular level because adequate genetic engineering tools for use in A. cellulolyticus are lacking. In the present study, we developed a gene disruption method for A. cellulolyticus, which needs a longer homologous region length. We cloned a putative A. cellulolyticus <b>creA</b> gene that is highly similar to the <b>creA</b> genes derived from other filamentous fungi, and isolated a <b>creA</b> disruptant strain by using the disruption method. Growth of the <b>creA</b> disruptant on agar plates was slower than that of the control strain. In the wild-type strain, the <b>CreA</b> protein was localized in the nucleus, suggesting that the cloned gene encodes the <b>CreA</b> transcription factor. Cellulase and xylanase production by the <b>creA</b> disruptant were higher than that of the control strain at the enzyme and transcription levels. Furthermore, the <b>creA</b> disruptant produced cellulase and xylanase in the presence of glucose. These data suggest both that the <b>CreA</b> protein functions as a catabolite repressor protein, and that disruption of <b>creA</b> is effective for enhancing enzyme production by A. cellulolyticus.|$|R

40|$|First Online: 23 November 2016 Ubiquitination/deubiquitination {{pathways}} are {{now recognized}} as {{key components of}} gene regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotes. The major transcriptional repressor for carbon catabolite repression in Aspergillus nidulans is <b>CreA,</b> and mutational analysis led to the suggestion that a regulatory ubiquitination/deubiquitination pathway is involved. A key unanswered question is if and how this pathway, comprising CreB (deubiquitinating enzyme) and HulA (ubiquitin ligase) and other proteins, {{is involved in the}} regulatory mechanism. Previously, missense alleles of <b>creA</b> and creB were analysed for genetic interactions, and here we extended this to complete loss-of-function alleles of <b>creA</b> and creB, and compared morphological and biochemical phenotypes, which confirmed genetic interaction between the genes. We investigated whether <b>CreA,</b> or a protein in a complex with it, is a direct target of the CreB deubiquitination enzyme, using co-purifications of <b>CreA</b> and CreB, first using strains that overexpress the proteins and then using strains that express the proteins from their native promoters. The Phos-tag system was used to show that <b>CreA</b> is a phosphorylated protein, but no ubiquitination was detected using anti-ubiquitin antibodies and Western analysis. These findings were confirmed using mass spectrometry, which confirmed that <b>CreA</b> was differentially phosphorylated but not ubiquitinated. Thus, <b>CreA</b> is not a direct target of CreB, and nor are proteins that form part of a stable complex with <b>CreA</b> a target of CreB. These results open up new questions regarding the molecular mechanism of <b>CreA</b> repressing activity, and how the ubiquitination pathway involving CreB interacts with this regulatory network.
