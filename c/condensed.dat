5|$|<b>Condensed</b> matter {{physics is}} {{a branch of}} physics that deals with the {{physical}} properties of <b>condensed</b> phases of matter, where particles adhere to each other. <b>Condensed</b> matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} <b>condensed</b> phases are solids and liquids while more exotic <b>condensed</b> phases include the superconducting phase exhibited by certain materials at low temperature, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases of spins on crystal lattices of atoms, and the Bose–Einstein condensate found in ultracold atomic systems. The study of <b>condensed</b> matter physics involves measuring various material properties via experimental probes along with using methods of theoretical physics to develop mathematical models that help in understanding physical behavior.|$|E

5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream {{that is totally}} <b>condensed</b> into a liquid product using water or air-cooling.

In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the reflux drum may contain a <b>condensed</b> liquid distillate phase, a <b>condensed</b> water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the reflux drum also have a water outlet stream.|$|E

5|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of <b>condensed</b> matter physics {{is closely related}} to the notion of emergence, wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents.

Similarly, models of <b>condensed</b> matter systems have been studied where collective excitations behave like photons and electrons, thereby describing electromagnetism as an emergent phenomenon. Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface, where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, superconductivity, and ferromagnetism.|$|E
