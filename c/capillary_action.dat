5|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{probably}} acts as a suction cup and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by <b>capillary</b> <b>action.</b> When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the tongue, the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their tongue length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is usually}} {{found in nature}} {{combined}} with other metals, or in minerals that contain silver compounds, generally {{in the form of}} sulfides such as galena (lead sulfide) or cerussite (lead carbonate). So the primary production of silver requires the smelting and then cupellation of argentiferous lead ores, a historically important process. Lead melts at 327°C, lead oxide at 888°C and silver melts at 960°C. To separate the silver, the alloy is melted again at the high temperature of 960°C to 1000°C in an oxidizing environment. The lead oxidises to lead monoxide, then known as litharge, which captures the oxygen from the other metals present. The liquid lead oxide is removed or absorbed by <b>capillary</b> <b>action</b> into the hearth linings.|$|E

Previous {{studies have shown that the}} vapour-liquid equilibria of many mixtures can be altered when the vapour-liquid interface is modified by capillary systems. This thesis studied the effects of <b>capillary</b> <b>actions</b> due to modified vapour-liquid interfaces on the vapour composition of ethanol-water and 1 -propanol-water systems. A method was developed to measure and compare the vapour compositions of systems with a planar vapour-liquid interface and systems with capillary plates. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of interface materials, pore sizes and liquid compositions. Significant differences in vapour composition between capillary systems and systems with a planar interface were observed. This difference was much larger than that predicted by the Kelvin equation. The mechanism of the <b>capillary</b> <b>actions</b> and the factors causing the increase in vapour composition were investigated...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{investigation}} of the 3 D mathematical model to simulate the coupled heat and liquid moisture transfer in hygroscopic porous fibrous media. The flow of the liquid moisture, the water vapor sorption/desorption by fibers and the diffusion of the water vapor are taken into account in this 3 D model. Prediction-corrector method is used to solve the 3 D governing equations. A series of computational results of the coupled heat and moisture transfer are obtained with the specific initial conditions and boundary conditions. The distribution of the water vapor concentration in the void spaces, the volume fraction of the liquid water in the void spaces, the distribution of the water content in fibers and the changes of the temperature in porous fibrous media are computed. It is shown that the effects of the gravity and <b>capillary</b> <b>actions</b> are significant in hygroscopic porous fibrous media. The comparison with the experimental measurements shows the reasonable agreement between the two. The results illustrate that the 3 D model of the coupled heat and liquid moisture transfer in hygroscopic porous fibrous media is satisfactory. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Unsaturated geomaterials {{are those}} geomaterials where the void spaces are {{partially}} filled with liquid and partially filled with gas. The liquid (wetting) phase is an aqueous solution generically {{referred to as}} water whereas the gaseous (nonwetting) phase {{is a mixture of}} air and water vapour generically referred to as air. The mutual interaction between these two fluid phases and their interaction with solid phase {{play a key role in}} the mechanical and hydraulic response of unsaturated geomaterials. The basic mechanisms and thermodynamics of the interaction between the liquid, gaseous, and solid phases are not commonly covered by undergraduate and graduate courses. As a result, students and engineers with geotechnical background may find it difficult to approach the mechanics and hydraulics of unsaturated soils. The purpose of this chapter is to fill this gap and to illustrate the basic elementary mechanisms behind water retention, water flow, and mechanical behaviour of unsaturated geomaterials. Special emphasis is given to capillary mechanisms arising from surface tension at the air-water interface and from the angle formed by the air-water interface at the solid-liquid-gas junction (contact angle). <b>Capillary</b> <b>actions</b> play a major role in the response of unsaturated geomaterials and can conveniently serve as a basis to introduce the most distinctive features of the hydraulic and mechanical response of unsaturated geomaterials...|$|R
40|$|Microorganisms behind {{ceramic tiles}} in {{bathrooms}} In this study {{the interface between}} the backside of ceramic tiles and the waterproof membrane was investigated for microbial growth in 13 bathrooms. This interface {{is made up of}} the backside of the ceramic tile, tile adhesive and the waterproof membrane. In every day used bathrooms water will accumulate in this particular environment. It is calculated that a tiled wall exposed to water in 15 minutes needs approximately six months to dry out since water is sucked, by <b>capillary</b> <b>actions,</b> through the grout joints between the ceramic tiles. The wall dries through diffusion forces and diffusion force is a weaker than capillary force and therefore the drying need longer time than the wetting of the wall with a water accumulation in the interface as a result. Samples were taken from areas where the wall and floor had been exposed to free water regularly, due to showering. Mould and/or bacterial growth was found on 69 % of the analysed specimens from the most water exposed places in the bathrooms. No such growth was found on the samples from the dryer areas. The results shows that although the environment behind the tiles may seem to disadvantaged for microbial growth, due to a limited amount of organic substances and due to pH values not favourable for microbial growth, such growth is possible when the moisture conditions are high. To our knowledge the microbial occurrence in this particular environment has not been investigated before...|$|R
25|$|Three main {{driving forces}} used in {{different}} version of diffusion models are moisture content, the partial pressure of water vapour, and the chemical potential (Skaar, 1988; Keey et al., 2000).

25|$|Aerogels are {{produced}} by extracting the liquid component of a gel through supercritical drying. This allows the liquid to be slowly dried off without causing the solid matrix in the gel to collapse from <b>capillary</b> <b>action,</b> as would happen with conventional evaporation. The first aerogels were produced from silica gels. Kistler's later work involved aerogels based on alumina, chromia and tin dioxide. Carbon aerogels were first developed in the late 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Because of its size, {{the tree}} {{has been studied}} for its water pull. Water from the roots can be pushed up only a few meters by osmotic {{pressure}} but can reach extreme heights by using a system of branching capillarity (<b>capillary</b> <b>action)</b> in the tree's xylem (the water tubules) and sub-pressure from evaporating water at the leaves. Sequoias supplement water from the soil with fog, taken up through air roots, at heights to where the root water cannot be pulled.|$|E
50|$|Front-loaders control water usage {{through the}} surface tension of water, and the <b>capillary</b> wicking <b>action</b> this creates in the fabric weave. A front-loader washer always fills to the same low water level, but a large pile of dry {{clothing}} standing in water will soak up the moisture, causing the water level to drop. The washer then refills to maintain the original water level. Because it takes time for this water absorption to occur with a motionless pile of fabric, nearly all front-loaders begin the washing process by slowly tumbling the clothing under the stream of water entering and filling the drum, to rapidly saturate the clothes with water.|$|R

V. Equilibrium of liquid droplets on soft deformable substrates is investigated. Disjoining pressure action {{in the vicinity of}} the apparent three phase contact line is taken into account. It is shown that the combined disjoining and <b>capillary</b> pressure <b>action</b> determine the substrate deformation. A simplified linear disjoining pressure isotherm and simple Winkler's model to account for the substrate deformation are used which allows deducing analytical solutions for both the liquid profile and the substrate deformation.

25|$|Salinity {{occurs on}} {{drylands}} from overirrigation and {{in areas with}} shallow saline water tables. Over-irrigation deposits salts in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil infiltration; irrigation merely increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known case of shallow saline water table <b>capillary</b> <b>action</b> occurred in Egypt after the 1970 construction of the Aswan Dam. The change in the groundwater level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the water table led to soil salination.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{the volume}} of a liquid exactly matches {{the volume of}} its container, one or more {{surfaces}} are observed. The surface of a liquid behaves like an elastic membrane in which surface tension appears, allowing the formation of drops and bubbles. Surface waves, <b>capillary</b> <b>action,</b> wetting, and ripples are other consequences of surface tension. In a confined liquid, defined by geometric constraints on a nanoscopic scale, most molecules sense some surface effects, which can result in physical properties grossly deviating {{from those of the}} bulk liquid.|$|E

The fluid is attracted to the substrate, and tiny fibres jump almost instantly from their point of emission, the Taylor cone, to the substrate, drying as they travel.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{examines}} the scenario {{of a university}} campus, and the impact on energy consumption of the awareness of building managers and users (lecturers, students and administrative staff). Design/methodology/approach – This study draws a comparison between direct fruition of the information by both skilled (building managers) and unskilled (users) recipients, {{and the effect of}} peer pressure and beneficial competition between users in applying the good practices. In fact, the usage of edutainment, implemented by the automatic publication on the Twitter platform of energy consumption data from different users, can promote general users’ awareness on best practices and their effect on energy consumption. In addition, the use of a social network platform allows the interaction between users, sharing experiences and increasing the collective intelligence in the energy efficiency field. Findings – Tests revealed that enhanced awareness helped managers to identify strategies that, if implemented in the whole building, could reduce energy consumption by about 6 %. The tests on university users’ awareness hint that the expected energy savings can reach 9 %, in addition to the previous 6 %. In fact, the measures were implemented in one of the three common rooms, and at building level the total energy consumption decreased by 3. 42 %, proving that a large deal of energy can be saved by <b>capillary</b> <b>actions</b> targeting society at large. The emerging collective intelligence of the final users ends up having a stronger effect on energy saving than the actions of more educated professionals. Practical implications – The approach used in this paper moved the burden of evolving the energy saving strategies to new scenarios onto the collective intelligence of the users, by connecting the users – and their experiences in new scenarios – using a social network to provide guidelines to other users involved in the same decision processes. Originality/Value – The authors of the paper use social technologies (Twitter, graphical interfaces) for a social goal (promote user awareness on energy usage) {{for the benefit of the}} society (energy savings).

40|$|Experimental results {{described}} in the present paper confirm the hypothesis about cavitational nature of the ultrasonic capillary effect (UCE), which is an abnormally high rise of a liquid in a <b>capillary</b> under the <b>action</b> of ultrasound. In accordance with this hypothesis UCE is associated with the collapse of cavitation bubbles at the capillary entry. Bubbles collapse asymmetrically to form a jets directed to the capillary but-end. By getting into the capillary channel, every such a jet increments the height of the capillary rise. When summed up these increments result in the experimentally observed increase of the height and speed of the liquid rise in the capillary. Theoretical estimations based on this mechanism are in acceptable agreement with experimental results...|$|R
25|$|Capillary tubes {{may also}} be used. A small sample of {{bacteria}} is collected {{on the end of}} the capillary tube, without blocking the tube, to avoid false negative results. The opposite end is then dipped into hydrogen peroxide, which is drawn into the tube through <b>capillary</b> <b>action,</b> and turned upside down, so that the bacterial points downwards. The hand holding the tube is then tapped on the bench, moving the hydrogen peroxide down until it touches the bacteria. If bubbles form on contact, this indicates a positive catalase result. This test can detect catalase-positive bacteria at concentrations above about 105 cells/mL, and is simple to use.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} conclusion {{were obtained}} from the studies on the mechanism of the development of hemorrhagic tendency which occurred in the case of compatible preserved blood transfusions. Following the repeated blood transfusions of small quantity, fibrinolysis, <b>capillary</b> permeability promoting <b>action</b> and increased heparinlike substance in blood were observed. These findings are manifestation of alarm reaction, and, in this way, potencial hemorrllagic tendency is considered to occur. Influence of citric acid, an anticoagulant of preserved blood on hemorrhagic tendency were studied. Elevated citrate levels were found following massive transfnsions of preserved citrated blood. However, it seems to be no correlation between the occurrence of hemorrhagic tendency and elevated citrate levels.

25|$|The {{manufacture}} of economical, reliable ballpoint pens {{as we know}} them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century. Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available. Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens. If the ball socket was too tight, or the ink too thick, it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{characterization}} of the cardiac N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) as a target for endogenous and synthetic agonists and antagonists. Using isolated perfused rat hearts, we have shown that intracoronary administration of the NMDAR agonists and antagonists has a pronounced effect on autonomous heart function. Perfusion of rat hearts with autologous blood supplemented with NMDAR agonists was associated with induction of tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia and ischemia occurring within physiological plasma concentration range for glutamate and glycine. Intracoronary administration of the NMDAR antagonists exerted an anti-arrhythmic effect and resulted in bradycardia and improvement of <b>capillary</b> perfusion. <b>Action</b> of antagonists eliprodil, Ro 25 - 6981, memantine, ketamine, and MK- 801 on autonomous heart function diverged strikingly from that of L-type Ca channel blockers. Cardiac NMDAR subunit composition differed from that of neuronal receptors and was age- and chamber-specific. Transcripts of the GluN 3 A and GluN 2 D were found in all heart chambers, whereas expression of GluN 1 and GluN 2 A and 2 C were restricted to the atria. Expression of the GluN 2 B protein in ventricles increased markedly with age of the animals.

60|$|One {{example of}} the ease of making good, but not {{permanent}} impressions, is found, and should be tried, by pressing the bulb of a finger against well-polished glass, or against the highly-polished blade of a razor. The finger must be very slightly oiled, as by passing it through the hair; if it be moist, dry it with a handkerchief before the oiling. Then press the bulb of the finger on the glass or razor, {{as the case may}} be, and a beautiful impression will be left. The hardness of the glass or steel prevents its surface from rising into the furrows under the pressure of the ridges, while the layer of oil which covers the bottom of the furrows is too thin to reach down to the glass or steel; consequently the ridges alone are printed. There is no <b>capillary</b> or other <b>action</b> to spread the oil, so the impression remains distinct. A merely moist and not oily finger leaves a similar mark, but it soon evaporates.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Liquid in grooved capillaries, made by e. g. {{inserting}} a plate in a cylindrical tube, exhibits unusual spreading and flow properties. One example is capillary rise, where a long, upward tongue {{on top of}} the usual meniscus has been observed along the groove. We attribute the underlying mechanism to a thermodynamic instability against spreading for a (partial or complete wetting) liquid in a sharp groove whose opening angle α is less than a critical value αc = π − 2 θ. The equilibrium shape of the tongue is determined analytically. The dynamics of liquid rising is studied in the viscous regime. When the diameter of the tube is smaller than the capillary length, the center part of the meniscus rises with time t following a t 1 / 2 -law, while the tongue is truncated at a height which grows following a t 1 / 3 -law. Sharp groove also facilitates release of gas bubbles trapped inside a <b>capillary</b> under the <b>action</b> of gravity. PACS numbers: 68. 10. Gw, 82. 65. -i, 87. 45. Ft...|$|R
