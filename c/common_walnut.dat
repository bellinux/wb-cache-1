2500|$|The <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> and {{the black}} walnut and its allies, are {{important}} for their attractive timber, which is hard, dense, tight-grained and polishes to a very smooth finish. The colour ranges from creamy white in the sapwood to a dark chocolate colour in the heartwood. When kiln-dried, walnut wood tends toward a dull brown colour, but when air-dried can become a rich purplish-brown. Because of its colour, hardness and grain, it is a prized furniture and carving wood. Walnut burls (or [...] "burrs" [...] in Europe) are commonly used to create bowls and other turned pieces. Veneer sliced from walnut burl {{is one of the}} most valuable and highly prized by cabinet makers and prestige car manufacturers. Walnut wood has been the timber of choice for gun makers for centuries, including the Gewehr 98 and Lee–Enfield rifles of the First World War. It remains one of the most popular choices for rifle and shotgun stocks, and is generally considered to be the premium – as well as the most traditional – wood for gun stocks, due to its resilience to compression along the grain. Walnut is also used in lutherie and for the body of pipe organs. The wood of the butternut and related Asian species is of much lower value, softer, coarser, less strong and heavy, and paler in colour.|$|E

After cDNA cloning and sequencing, 544 ESTs were annotated. Of these, 66 % had an open reading frame and could be matched to a previously sequenced gene. Based on BLAST sequence homology, 9 % (49 of 544 sequences) were nuclear genes potentially involved in olfaction. The most significant finding is a putative odorant receptor (OR), RSOr 1, that is homologous to Drosophila melanogaster Or 49 a and Or 85 f.

40|$|Abstract Background Compared {{with other}} <b>common</b> plant foods, <b>walnuts</b> (Juglans regia) are {{consistently}} {{ranked among the}} highest in antioxidant capacity. In vitro, walnut polyphenols inhibit plasma and LDL oxidation, while in animal models they lower biomarkers of oxidative stress and raise antioxidant capacity. A limited number of human feeding trials indicate that walnuts improve some measures of antioxidant status, but not others. Methods A 19 wk, randomized crossover trial was conducted in 21 generally healthy men and postmenopausal women ≥ 50 y to study the dose-response effects of walnut intake on biomarkers of antioxidant activity, oxidative stress, and nutrient status. Subjects were randomized to receive either 21 or 42 g raw walnuts/d during each 6 wk intervention phase with a 6 wk washout between phases. Subjects were instructed to consume their usual diet, but refrain from eating any other tree nuts, seeds, peanuts, or ellagitannin-rich foods during the entire study, and other polyphenol-rich foods for 2 d prior to each study visit. Results Compared to baseline levels, red blood cell (RBC) linoleic acid and plasma pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) were significantly higher after 6 wk with 42 g/d walnuts (P Conclusions Walnut consumption did not significantly change the plasma antioxidant capacity of healthy, well-nourished older adults in this pilot study. However, improvements in linoleic acid and pyridoxal phosphate were observed with chronic consumption, while total plasma thiols were enhanced acutely. Future studies investigating the antioxidant effects of walnuts in humans are warranted, but should include either a larger sample size or a controlled feeding intervention.

40|$|Results {{about the}} effects of {{thinning}} and mixed plantations with Italian alder (Alnus cordata Loisel.) on growth and efficiency of <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> (Juglans regia L.) plantations for wood production are reported. The study, carried out for six years on sixteen year old plantations, compared three theses: pure <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> plantation (pure common walnut); 50 % <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> - 50 % Italian alder plantation; 25 % <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> - 75 % Italian alder plantation. Beyond annual surveys of girth at breast height, total height, stem volume and biomass, several variables, useful to describe canopy and foliage characteristics such as leaf area index (LAI), leaf biomass and photosynthetic active radiation below the canopy, were recorded. Data collected allowed to compare growth at individual and whole stand level, to calculate the net assimilation rate (NAR) and to compare the growth efficiency of the three theses. Mixed plantations performed results significantly higher than the pure plantation in terms of growth, LAI and leaf biomass both before and after experimental thinning. With reference only to <b>common</b> <b>walnut,</b> growth in mixed plantations was higher than the pure plantation with differences ranging from + 40 % to + 100 %. More relevant differences among pure <b>common</b> <b>walnut,</b> 50 % <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> and 25 % <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> at canopy and foliage characteristics were observed, with LAI values of 1. 07, 3. 96 e 4. 35 m 2 m- 2 respectively.

40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>walnut</b> (Juglans regia L) is an {{economically}} important species cultivated worldwide for its wood and nuts. It is generally accepted that J. regia survived and grew spontaneously in almost completely isolated stands in its Asian native range after the Last Glacial Maximum.

We evaluated the hypothesis that the current distribution of natural genetic resources of <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> in Asia is, at least in part, the product of ancient anthropogenic dispersal, human cultural interactions, and afforestation. Genetic analysis combined with ethno-linguistic and historical data indicated that ancient trade routes such as the Persian Royal Road and Silk Road enabled long-distance dispersal of J. regia from Iran and Trans-Caucasus to Central Asia, and from Western to Eastern China. Ancient commerce also disrupted the local spatial genetic structure of autochthonous walnut populations between Tashkent and Samarkand (Central- Eastern Uzbekistan), where the northern and central routes of the Northern Silk Road converged.

40|$|U ovom istraživanju analizirana su fenotipska i adaptabilna svojstva familija običnog oraha(Juglans regiaL.) u testu potomstva polusrodnika na lokalitetu Zabrdica i Kozarevac I. Prvi test potomstva polusrodnika običnog oraha na lokalitetu Zabrdica osnovan je 1981. godine, a drugi 1983. godine na području Uprave šuma podružnica Koprivnica, šumarija Sokolovac i Kloštar Podravski. Na površinama od oko 3, 5 ha, zasađeno je po pokusu 400 sadnica generativnog porijekla po blok-metodi u četiri ponavljanja. Proučavanje uzajamnog djelovanja nasljeđa i okoline temelji se na pretpostavkama da se sredina mora kontrolirati (uzgoj pod sličnim uvjetima) i da fenotipovi moraju biti poznati, što je u ovim pokusima i učinjeno, posvjećujući pritom posebnu pozornost čimbenicima okoline. U tako planiranim i provedenim pokusima, odnos genotipova i okoline, može se proučavati kroz tzv. fenotipsku stabilnost. Analiza fenotipske stabilnosti familija običnog oraha na lokalitetima (staništima) provedena je modelom regresijske analize, pri čemu su fenotipske vrijednosti (prirast i masa ploda) određene familije prikazane kao linearne funkcije okoline. Za nezavisnu varijablu odabrana je srednja vrijednost odgovarajućeg fenotipskog obilježja svih familija, tj. debljinski prirast, odnosno masa ploda srednjeg stabla na lokalitetu. Rezultati tih analiza navedeni su u tablicama 1. i 2. te prikazani na slikama 4. i 5. Na temelju adaptacijske sposobnosti i produkcijskog potencijala određenog genotipa, može se odrediti uporabna vrijednost za podizanje nasada.

With the origin in central Asia it is widespread worldwide except in tropical and subtropical regions. Its broad applications in nourishment, medicine, pharmacology and food processing, wood and leather industry makes {{it one of the}} most valuable plant species. The distribution of <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> in Croatia is more a result of favorable climatic and soil conditions than the organized cultivation. In Croatian <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> is mostly spread in the hilly terrains around Hrvatsko Zagorje around Požega, Koprivnica, Bjelovar, Daruvar, Kutina, Sisak, Jastrebarsko Ozalj; in Eastern Slavonia around Vukovar and Ilok in Baranja. In Dalmatia around Split, Drniš, and Zadar hinterland, in Primorje in the hinterland of Novi Vinodolski, Crikvenica, Senj, in Istria and part of Herzegovina. This paper presents the results of work on the selection of individual trees and the establishment of halbsib-progeny tests, over the five-year research of quantitative and morphometric traits in progeny tests of <b>common</b> <b>walnut,</b> tested in two habitats. Research sites are located at two locations that were most suitable for testing due to the ecological and soil characteristics of selections in continental part of Croatia. These sites are: Zabrdica, under forestry office Sokolovac and Kozarevac I under the forestry office Kloštar Podravski. The study of interaction between heritage and environment is based on the assumption that environment must be controlled (similar growing conditions) and phenotypes must be known, as done in these experiments, devoting the special attention to environmental factors. In such planned and conducted experiments, relationship between genotype and environment can be studied through so-called phenotypic stability. Analysis of phenotypic stability of <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> families in the localities (habitats) was conducted in the model of regression analysis in which the phenotypic values (growth and fruit mass) of specific families are shown as a linear function of the environment. For the independent variable it is selected the mean value of the corresponding phenotypic characteristic of families, ie diameter growth and fruit mass of the center tree at the locality. Results are listed in Table 1, 2 and shown in Figure 4, 5. Below average growth stability and specific adaptability to high-yield environment (Zabrdica) showed families Stain 2, 4 and 6, while Stains 12, 13 and 18 showed above average stability and specific adaptability to adverse environment (Kozarevac I). Other families showed the average stability and good adaptability to all environments (Zabrdica and Kozarevac I) (Table 1 and Figure 4). Below average fruit mass stability and specific adaptability to high-yield environment (Kozarevac I) showed only Stain 16, while Stains 1, 3, 4, 6, 15, 17, and 18 showed above average stability and specific adaptability to adverse environment (Zabrdica). Other families showed the average stability and good adaptability to all environments (Zabrdica and Kozarevac I) (Table 2 and Figure 5). Based on adaptation capacity and production potential of the particular genotype can be determined its use-value for plantation raising. Genotypes with good adaptation ability and high productivity are the best solution for growing the <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> in plantations.

40|$|The European or <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> {{is a large}} tree prized as a {{multipurpose}} species: {{it provides}} valuable timber and produces a high-quality edible nut. The diffusion of the species in Italy has been largely influenced by the human activity, mainly through germplasm movement, selection of genotypes most suited for wood or fruit production and adaptation induced on fruit crop reproductive materials. As a consequence, genetic variability has been reduced, so that programs aimed at its preservation appear of the utmost importance. 104 walnut plants growing in Piedmont, northwestern Italy, were investigated through genetic variation scored at RAPD loci, yielded by PCR amplification of 10 decamer primers. Among the 101 studied loci, only 53 were polymorphic, showing {{a low level of}} genetic variation within the studied material. Genetic differentiation was estimated both at individual and geographical area level. Only in few cases trees growing in the same area showed to be genetically similar, while the differentiation between areas accounted for about 10 % of the total variation, according to AMOVA. No significant correlation was found between genetic and geographic distances.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Common</b> <b>walnut,</b> due to {{decorative}} {{habit of}} its crown, is a frequently growing tree in Lublin’s parks and gardens. Its {{presence in the}} town landscape provokes deeper analysis of the fauna occurring on it. The aim {{of this paper was}} to trace the changes in numerical force with reference to the weather conditions system, as well as to establish the bionomics of Panaphis juglandis (Goeze) occupying the trees of Juglans regia L. Studies were conducted on <b>common</b> <b>walnut</b> (Juglans regia L.) in Lublin in 2006 – 2008. Three locations were designed for observation: garden (A), park (B) and street-side (C). Numerical strength and bionomics of P. juglandis were determined. The greatest number of aphids was reported in the year 2007 in the park location. The course of weather condi-tions significantly affected the terms of spring and autumn presence of aphids. Warm spring with not very intense precipitation enhanced the development of P. juglandis. However, torrential rains and air temperatures exceeding 30 ºC in summer limited the population dynamics of this aphid. In the developmental cycle the appearance of subsequent generations was observed from family founders through virginoparous females to sexual generation. Studies on female fecundity were performed. In all the study years the highest mean fecundity was that of the family founders, and the lowest was found in the females of sexual generation. The most fecunde virginoparous females (68. 4 larvae · female- 1) were observed in spring 2006 in the street location. Observations were also undertaken, which concerned determining the place and term of aphid occur-rence, as well as the number of eggs on lignified sprouts of Juglans regia L.

By integrating fossil pollen, cultural, and historical data with population genetics, and approximate Bayesian analysis, we reconstructed the demographic history of walnut and its routes of dispersal across Europe. The genetic data confirmed the presence of walnut in glacial refugia in the Balkans and western Europe. We conclude that human-mediated admixture between Anatolian and Balkan walnut germplasm started in the Early Bronze Age, and between western Europe and the Balkans in eastern Europe during the Roman Empire. A population size expansion and subsequent decline in northeastern and western Europe was detected in the last five centuries. The actual distribution of walnut in Europe resulted from the combined effects of expansion/contraction from multiple refugia after the Last Glacial Maximum and its human exploitation over the last 5, 000 years...|$|E
