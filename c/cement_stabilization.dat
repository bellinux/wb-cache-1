The major proportion of waste material within landfills is Construction and Demolition material (C&D). C&D material can be a suitable alternative for quarry material in pavement applications.

40|$|Stabilization of soft soils, such as clays, using cement {{tends to}} result in a soilcement matrix which is stiff and lack in elasticity. By adding small {{quantities}} of rubber chips in the soil-cement mix, the natural elasticity of rubber could help lower the stiffness of the stabilized material and introduce more flexibility in the final stabilized columnar system. Rubber, having low density, high elasticity, low stiffness and high shear strength at large strains, could indeed complement and enhance the limitations of <b>cement</b> <b>stabilization.</b> Clays tend to have lower shear strengths and are known to lose strength further upon wetting.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is intended to}} provide detailed technical and economic information on the production of compressed cement stabilised soil bricks. These include information on suitable soil types, local stabilisers, stabilization techniques, production of compressed stabilized soil bricks and their economical value and potential. Critical review of related literatures show that soil types, proportions between soil and stabilizer and compaction pressure applied to the moist soil mix affects {{the quality of the}} compressed soil brick. Since the soil used to manufacture the stabilized soil bricks are abundantly available all around the Tamil Nadu. Laboratory tests conducted on Perundurai area soil provided more precise and detailed information on the soils grading, plasticity, chemical composition and the result proved the soil’s suitability for brick production. Using the Ordinary Portland Cement manufactured as stabilizer and soil sample from Perundurai, three different series of tests were prepared based on literature recommendations. Tests were conducted on soil bricks performance like compressive strength and water absorption on which the durability of the blocks depend. The effects of compaction pressure {{on the quality of the}} soil bricks, the optimum <b>cement</b> content for <b>stabilization</b> and cost comparison with hollow concrete bricks are prepared. The performance characteristics of local stabilizers are evaluated and comparisons are made. The investigation has revealed that from the bricks produced at the varying cement contents from 12 % in increments of 2 % up to 16 % at constant compressive pressure of 10 MPa, all the blocks except bricks produced by 16 % cement have 21 stday wet compressive strength values well above most of the recommended minimum values for use in structural work. Thus 16 % cement is taken as optimum <b>cement</b> content for <b>stabilization</b> of Tamil Nadu soil for brick production. Further increasing cement content results in an increase in the compressive strength value and a decrease in the absorption capacity of the soil brick. Increment of the compaction pressure also improves the compressive strength of soil cement brick. Comparisons of the effects of local brick masonry and soil brickmasonry showed that soil brick masonry has shown better stabilization effect based on the 21 stday compressive strength of bricks. The cost comparison with the conventional wall making material, hollow concrete bricks, has revealed that compressed cement stabilized soil brick is preferred because it is more economical walling material lin itself and permits the use of economical building techniques...|$|R

There was a significant improvement in the mean ODI (70, 6 % to 30, 1 %) as well as a significant reduction in pain intensity (VAS) (7, 7 to 1, 4) after 12 month.

40|$|The Deep Mixing Method, which {{involves}} {{the formation of}} in situ stabilized peat columns, is suitable for deep peat stabilization, whereas the mass stabilization technique is used to stabilize the soil of shallow peat deposits instead of the costly and problematic removal and replacement method. The concept of soil-cement stabilization involves the addition of water to cement, resulting in a chemical process known as <b>cement</b> hydration. <b>Stabilization</b> of peat by cement, which requires a significant strength increase in the cement-stabilized peat or organic soil, is attributed largely to physicochemical reactions that include cement hydration, hardening of the resulting cement paste and interactions between soil substances and primary and secondary cementation hydration products. The factors that affect these physicochemical reactions and the interactions of peat soil-cementation products that influence peat stabilization are the amount of solid particles, the water: soil ratio, the quantity of binder, the presence of humic and/or fulvic acids, the soil pH {{and the amount of}} organic matter in the peat. With the Air Curing Technique, stabilized peat samples for unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests were kept at a normal air temperature of 30 Â Â±Â  2 Â Â°C and strengthened by gradual moisture content reduction instead of the usual water-curing technique or water submersion methods that have been common practice in past experiments involving the stabilization of peat with cement. The principle of using the Air Curing Technique to strengthen stabilized peat is that peat soil at its natural moisture content contains sufficient water (water content from 198 to 417 Â ) that, when mixed with cement, a curing process takes place that causes the stabilized peat soil to gradually lose its moisture content and to become drier and harder throughout the curing period. This process does not require the addition of water...|$|R

They provide strength and longevity for total joint replacements, however they are not without their disadvantages. Issues such as polymerization shrinkage, high curing temperatures, and component toxicity have been reported. In order to address these problems, we replaced the methacrylate-based resin with a silorane-based system, which are novel monomers previously used for dental composites. Our goal is to develop a new bone cement that would have handling times between 10 – 20 min, curing temperatures under 45 °C, good mechanical strength, and biocompatibility. An important part of this effort centered on the identification and investigation of silorane initiation systems, which can be tailored for specific uses including internal bone cements. The initial screening process utilized the neat resin system followed by differing formulations including modified and unmodified fillers. The tests were based in part on the ISO standard 5833 used for acrylic resin cements and included exothermicity, degree of cure, biocompatibility, and mechanical strength. From these studies, we identified alternative bone cement formulations, which met or exceeded our desired properties as compared to commercially available bone cement.
