5|$|Although Nash would <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was never}} prouder {{than when he}} was a soldier, always wore his Returned Services League (RSL) badge and eagerly {{attended}} reunions of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, he never marched on Anzac Day or applied for the campaign medals for which he was eligible.|$|E

5|$|Amin did {{not write}} an autobiography, {{and he did not}} authorize an {{official}} written account of his life. So, there are discrepancies regarding when and where he was born. Most biographical sources <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born in either Koboko or Kampala around 1925. Other unconfirmed sources state Amin's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. Amin's son Hussein has stated that his father was born in Kampala in 1928.|$|E
25|$|Hagar <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was fired; Van Halen <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had quit.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, Zarinsky <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had accidentally killed Rosemary {{and buried}} {{her body in}} {{northwest}} New Jersey. <b>He</b> later <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had thrown her body into the Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
50|$|He {{disappeared}} in July 2001, after <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was returning to}} Lebanon - and resurfaced after the attacks, <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was going to sue Der Spiegel for libel, for their report <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had worked with Intelligence agencies.|$|R
5|$|Karmal {{was born}} Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929, {{was the son}} of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a Major General in the Afghan Army and former {{governor}} of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background is disputed, some <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was Tajik who represented himself as a Ghilzai Pashtun but others <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> descended from Hindu ancestors of Kashmir. In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the Mullakhel branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry {{comes from the fact that}} his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik. To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke Dari (Persian) and not Pashto.|$|E
5|$|Nuyts {{acquired}} some notoriety while Governor for apparently taking native {{women to}} his bed, {{and having a}} translator hide under the bed to interpret his pillow-talk. He was also accused of profiting from private trade, something which was forbidden under company rules. Some sources <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> officially married a native Formosan woman during this time, but as he was still legally married to his first wife Cornelia, this seems unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his lupus condition to recur. Jackson's autopsy did not confirm or refute the <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had lupus, but it did confirm that he had vitiligo. His skin {{was found to have}} reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation.|$|E

She <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> defamed her by reprinting {{the article}} <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the {{favourite}} and that Holland was not {{qualified for the}} job. Heaps and Holland eventually {{settled out of court}} with Heaps issuing an apology and paying for legal expenses.|$|R
5000|$|Kukić <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{attacked}} {{with a baseball}} bat in 2014 due to his meeting with the controversial war criminal Dario Kordić. After the attack, Kukić <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not significantly injured. Prime minister Nermin Niksic condemned the attack, calling it [...] "another of a series of fascist outbursts".|$|R
5|$|After {{his term}} as governor, Brown again {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1896, losing to Republican Walter Evans. He would later <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had only run {{in order to improve}} Democratic voter turnout for William Jennings Bryan's 1896 presidential bid. Prior to the 1899 Democratic nominating convention, Brown was mentioned as a possible gubernatorial nominee, but he declined to become a candidate. When the convention began, he was mentioned as a candidate for convention chairman, but he also refused to serve in this capacity.|$|E
5|$|Claiming the General Assembly's {{decision}} was invalid, Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising {{the authority of}} the governor's office. Beckham countersued Taylor for possession of the state capitol and governor's mansion. The suits were consolidated and heard in Jefferson County circuit court, which claimed it had no authority to interfere with the method of deciding contested elections prescribed by the state constitution, an outcome that favored Beckham. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court's decision on appeal and rejected Taylor's <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been deprived of property without due process by stating that an elective office was not property and thus not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 1 May, Krebs talked to General Chuikov, {{commander}} of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, informing him of Hitler's death and a willingness to negotiate a citywide surrender. They could not agree on terms because of Soviet insistence on unconditional surrender and Krebs' <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> lacked authorisation to agree to that. Goebbels was against surrender. In the afternoon, Goebbels and his wife killed their children and then themselves. Goebbels's death removed the last impediment which prevented Weidling from accepting the terms of unconditional surrender of his garrison, but he chose to delay the surrender until the next morning to allow the planned breakout to take place under the cover of darkness.|$|E
50|$|Michael Lane {{was arrested}} {{the same day}} at his then {{workplace}} in Burgess Hill. He initially lied to police about his movements that day, before admitting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had gone to Shana Grices' home. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had found the front door open, then found Shanas' body in her bedroom. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> panicked, then left the scene without dialling 999, checking Shanas' vital signs or telling his family what he had found. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> only kept quiet {{about what he had}} seen because he was afraid of being accused of her murder.|$|R

50|$|After he was drafted, {{a dispute}} arose about his {{concussion}} history {{during his time}} with the Broncos, triggered by an NFL Network report <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had three concussions during his college career and McClellin <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> only had one. When asked about this, McClellin stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had concussion-like symptoms, rather than a concussion.|$|R
5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegal—he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify what she had said before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to defend him.|$|E
5|$|He {{bought a}} 365-acre (148-hectare) 20-bedroom luxury estate in Rockwood, Surrey in 1995 through {{a chain of}} firms, trusts, and {{offshore}} companies in 1994. The country home's refurbishment abruptly ended in October 1996, shortly {{before the end of}} his wife's second term. He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property and no one paid the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion. Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004 and the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds because the home had been bought with money obtained through corruption. However, he stepped in to <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> actually was the beneficial owner. , the proceeds were in a liquidator bank account while a civil case continues.|$|E
5|$|He {{was tried}} before Curiohaus war crimes court in Rotherbaum, in Court Number 5 on Monday, 11 October 1948. Knöchlein's defence hinged on the <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was not present}} at the massacre, {{although}} his lawyers did not deny that the event took place. They also claimed that the British had used dumdum bullets during the battle and misused a flag of truce; {{all of which were}} vigorously denied by the prosecution. Evidence was given by Pooley, O'Callaghan, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and a French civilian who testified to recognising Knöchlein.|$|E
5000|$|Kim <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had been}} {{planning}} to end Park's dictatorship for seven years (The Yusin Constitution of 1972 was ratified seven years before <b>that).</b> <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> attempted to assassinate Park three times: in 1974 and twice in 1979. There are some pieces of evidence that partially corroborate these statements, which will be discussed later.|$|R
50|$|Hodgkinson has <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was hospitalized}} during the {{purchase}} of World Championship Wrestling by Vince McMahon. Hodgkinson was informed that WWF creative team had no plans for him and would not pick up his contract post-merger. <b>He</b> had also <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> planned on leaving WCW before he broke his neck.|$|R
50|$|At his trial, Homma also <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was so {{preoccupied with}} {{the plans for the}} Corregidor assault <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{forgotten}} about the prisoners’ treatment, believing that his officers were properly handling the matter. <b>He</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not learn of the atrocity until after the war, even though his headquarters were only 500 feet from the route of the march.|$|R
5|$|In February 1897, the New York Times prematurely {{reported}} {{his death}} in a New York mental asylum. Some authors <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> contracted syphilis, {{which may have been}} a cause of the mental breakdowns he suffered in his last years. In the months prior to his death, he spent some time in institutions {{as a result of his}} failing mental health. His chess activities had not yielded any great financial rewards, and he died a pauper in the Manhattan State Hospital (Ward Island) of a heart attack on August 12, 1900. Steinitz is buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York. His second wife and their two young children were still alive at his death.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Warelwast's {{background}} or family before 1087. Later in life {{he was involved in}} founding Augustinian houses of canons, which– according to historian – implies that he was an Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents. He must also have been an accomplished speaker, given the number of times he was used as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at Laon, where later in life he sent his nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.|$|E
5|$|Sai Baba's disciples and devotees <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{performed}} many miracles such as bilocation, levitation, mindreading, materialisation, exorcisms, {{entering a}} state of Samādhi at will, lighting lamps with water, removing his limbs or intestines and sticking them back to his body (khandana yoga), curing the incurably sick, appearing beaten when another was beaten, preventing a mosque from falling down on people, and helping his devotees in other miraculous ways. He also gave Darshan (vision) {{to people in the}} form of Sri Rama, Krishna, Vithoba, Shiva and many other gods depending on the faith of devotees.|$|E

5|$|The book did {{contain some}} inaccuracies, {{particularly}} those surrounding Savage's <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the illegitimate {{child of a}} nobleman. It was successful in its partial analysis of Savage's poetry and in portraying insights into Savage's personality, but {{for all of its}} literary achievements it did not bring immediate fame or income to Johnson or to Cave; it did, though, provide Johnson with a welcome small income at an opportune time in his life. More importantly, the work helped to mould Johnson into a biographical career; it was included in his later Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets series.|$|E
5|$|After Prince died in 1899 he was {{replaced}} by the Reverend John Hugh Smyth-Pigott. Around 1890, Smyth-Pigott again started leading meetings of the community and recruited 50 young female followers to supplement the ageing population of Agapemonites. He took Ruth Anne Preece as his second wife and she had three children, named Glory, Power and Hallelujah. By 1902 his fame had spread as far as India, from where Mirza Ghulam Ahmad warned him of his false teachings and made a death prophecy against him stating that he would die within Mirza's lifetime, if he will <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a god another time, which did come true as in the life time of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he stopped claiming being a god. After the death of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad he claimed again being god and was sentenced to death and died.|$|E
5|$|Al-Hajjaj {{initially}} retreated {{before the}} rebels' superior numbers, but quickly defeated and drove {{them out of}} Basra. Nevertheless, the rebels seized Kufa, where supporters started flocking. The revolt gained widespread support among those who were discontented with the Umayyad regime, especially the religious scholars known as qurrāʾ ("Quran readers"). Caliph Abd al-Malik tried to negotiate terms, including the dismissal of al-Hajjaj, but the hardliners among the rebel leadership pressured Ibn al-Ash'ath into rejecting the Caliph's terms. In the subsequent Battle of Dayr al-Jamajim, the rebel army was decisively defeated by al-Hajjaj's Syrian troops. Al-Hajjaj pursued the survivors, who under Ibn al-Ash'ath fled to the east. Most of the rebels were captured by the governor of Khurasan, while Ibn al-Ash'ath himself fled to Zabulistan. His fate is unclear, as some accounts hold that, after long pressure from al-Hajjaj to surrender him, the Zunbīl executed him, while most sources <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> committed suicide to avoid being handed over to his enemies.|$|E
