5|$|The {{story line}} took on many forms during production. His {{original}} idea featured a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters that he {{drew in a}} book as a child <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to bother him as an adult. Each monster represented a fear he had, and conquering those fears caused the monsters eventually to disappear.|$|E
5|$|De Mauro {{was kidnapped}} {{on the evening}} of September 16, 1970, while <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> home from work, in the via delle Magnolie in Palermo. Thousands of police and Carabinieri with {{helicopters}} and dogs combed Sicily in vain in search of the reporter. De Mauro’s body has never been found, a victim of the so-called lupara bianca, despite intensive search efforts by Palermo police assisted by top-level forces from Rome and even a special investigative committee of the Italian Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Newt Lee, {{the night}} watchman, arrived at work shortly before 4:00 and Frank, who was {{normally}} calm, came bustling {{out of his}} office. Frank told Lee {{that he had not}} yet finished his own work and asked Lee to return at 6:00. Newt Lee noticed that Frank was very agitated and asked if he could sleep in the packing room, but Frank was insistent that Lee leave the building and told Lee to go out {{and have a good time}} in town before <b>coming</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} been widely commended for its honesty, with Trescothick's {{difficulties}} drawing comparison with Harold Gimblett's similar mental health problems. Despite attempts by Pietersen to entice Trescothick back into the England set-up, Trescothick confirmed that his {{decision has been made}} and that he is putting his health and family first. In November 2008 <b>Coming</b> <b>Back</b> to Me was named the 2008 William Hill Sports Book of the Year. In April 2009, Trescothick turned down another request from new England captain Andrew Strauss to consider making himself available for England's World Twenty20 Championship campaign.|$|E
5|$|The damage Vertu {{had taken}} {{early in the}} combat {{rendered}} Lhermitte unable to continue the action, and his ship gradually {{fell out of the}} line to the south. Captain Pierre Julien Tréhouart turned Cybèle away too, using sweeps to reach Vertu and take the ship under tow. With Vertu secured and Arrogant slowly <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> into range, Sercey ordered his squadron to turn away to the north at 10:55, the last shots fired at long range from Victorious at 11:15.|$|E
5000|$|Four singles were {{released}} {{to promote the}} album. The first official single, [...] "Come on, be a No-One" [...] found release on 23 April, while 22 July brought [...] "Glitters Like Gold". Both singles have continued a tradition of <b>coming</b> <b>backed</b> with original b-sides. Bookending these singles, the band gave away the song [...] "Chi-Town" [...] as a free digital download and as an extra release to those who purchased the deluxe edition of the LP on 14 February 2012, whereas a collaboration with artist Martin Creed produced Work #1431, a video for [...] "Anna".|$|R

5|$|The {{reintegration}} of French prisoners into {{civilian life}} was facilitated by {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to regain their pre-war jobs because of the shortage of labour. The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be more sympathetic to the Vichy regime, but prisoners <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{small size}} and {{independence}} of the laser modules allowed the huge NIF building to be dispensed with. Instead, the modules were arranged in groups surrounding the target chamber in a compact arrangement. In baseline designs, the modules were stacked in 2-wide by 8-high groups in two rings {{above and below the}} target chamber, shining their light through small holes drilled into the chamber to protect them from the neutron flux <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> out.|$|E
5|$|The website of the UK {{law firm}} , which was {{associated}} with an anti-piracy client, was affected by the cyber-attack. In retaliation for the initial attacks being called only a minor nuisance, Anonymous launched more attacks, bringing the site down yet again. After <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> up, the front page accidentally revealed a backup file of the entire website, which contained over 300 megabytes of private company emails, which were leaked to several torrents and across several sites on the Internet.|$|E

5|$|This {{version of}} the song replaces the word 'nights' with 'lights', in the line 'There were nights of endless pleasure'. The ending of the single version is different, {{concluding}} with an additional 'We forgive and forget and it's all <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to me now'. The album version, following those recorded by Pandora's Box and Celine Dion, ends with the female voice whispering 'And if we...', followed by four piano notes.|$|E
5|$|Tony Warner is {{starring}} in the lead role of Macbeth at the Duke of Cambridge Theatre. <b>Coming</b> <b>back</b> to his dressing room after a performance, he is visited by his understudy Jim. When invited to attend the understudy rehearsal, Tony makes an excuse about having a voiceover job at that time; and the pair are joined by Tony's neighbours Jean and Bill, who have just watched Tony's performance. Tony leaves with them, and Jim puts on Tony's prop crown, imagining himself in the leading role.|$|E
5|$|While {{the core}} was under construction, a {{corridor}} was left open {{leading into the}} shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the 3rd Dynasty seemingly <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the 4th Dynasty.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Brock shuddered as {{the terror}} of the present time and the darker terror yet of the future that might be <b>coming</b> rushed <b>back</b> on him {{at the sight of}} the man's face. The man saw it, and spoke first.|$|R

5|$|After {{playing an}} {{exhibition}} match, Murray started the French Open with three tough wins, before losing in straight sets to Tomáš Berdych {{in the fourth}} round. In London, Murray progressed to the third round, where he faced Mardy Fish. At 3–3 in the final set with momentum going Murray's way (he had {{just come back from}} 3–0 down), the match was called off for bad light, leaving Murray fuming. <b>Coming</b> <b>back</b> the next day, Murray was edged out by the eventual finalist in a tie-breaker for his second defeat by him in the year. At Wimbledon, Murray progressed to the semifinals, losing to Nadal in straight sets. On 27 July 2010, Murray and his coach Maclagan split, and Murray replaced him with Àlex Corretja.|$|E
5|$|After sailing back to Argentina in March and April 1926, Rivadavia {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of the year undergoing sea trials. The dreadnought joined the training division once again in 1927, but after Rivadavia made four training cruises, the division was disbanded, and the ship remained moored in Puerto Belgrano until 1929. This began a series of cyclic activity followed by being demoted to the reserve fleet. Although active in both 1929 and 1930, Rivadavia was placed in reserve on 19 December 1930. Shortly thereafter, it was restored to active service to serve as the flagship for 1931 fleet exercises. Rivadavia went back into reserve in 1932 before <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> out in January 1933. It remained in full commission for {{most of the rest of}} the decade as part of the Battleship Division, alongside Moreno.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, the two {{follow the}} cloud to a castle. There, the cloud {{condenses}} into a demonic form, presumably Hunson Abadeer. While {{running through the}} castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds the demon with his sword. At that moment it is revealed that the demon is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, {{been transformed into a}} hideous demon. She musters enough strength to forbid Finn and Jake from <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to the Nightosphere, and, after the two are teleported back to their dimension, she closes the portal.|$|E
60|$|He {{was away}} a long time--so long that the half-penitent Mrs. Hatchard was {{beginning}} to think of giving first aid to the wounded. Then she heard him <b>coming</b> slowly <b>back</b> along the passage. He entered the room, drying his wet hair on a hand-kerchief.|$|R
