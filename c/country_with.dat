5|$|A <b>country</b> <b>with</b> a large {{trade surplus}} would {{generally}} {{see the value}} of its currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this benefit is likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E

40|$|Using {{corporate}} payout {{data from}} 33 economies, this study investigates {{the contribution of}} stock repurchases {{to the value of}} the firm and cash holdings in different country-level investor protection environments. We find that stock repurchases contribute more to firm value in <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> strong investor protection than in <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> weak investor protection. We also report that dividends contribute approximately 60 % more to firm value than repurchases in <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> weak investor protection. Furthermore, as the proportion of repurchases in total payouts increases, the marginal value of cash increases in <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> strong investor protection, whereas it declines in <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> weak investor protection. In a poor investor protection environment, the marginal value of cash for a firm that makes 100 % of its payouts via repurchases is 12 cents lower than that for a firm that distributes 100 % of its payouts via dividends. Overall, our findings highlight that stock repurchases are less effective than dividends in mitigating agency problems associated with free cash flow in <b>countries</b> <b>with</b> poor investor protection.
