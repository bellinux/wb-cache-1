40|$|An easterly tip jet that {{occurred}} on 21 February 2007 off Cape Farewell, Greenland, is examined. In Part I {{of this article}} aircraft observations were described. Now, in Part II, numerical simulations and an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynamical forcing mechanisms are presented. The simulations make use of a limited-area 12 km resolution configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Met Office's Unified Model. Sea-surface temperatures and sea-ice concentrations have been replaced using the Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) product, addressing a boundary-layer temperature bias, while roughness lengths over sea ice have been updated, addressing a wind-speed bias. These modifications ensured a reasonably accurate simulation: generally within 1 – 2 K and 2 – 3 m s- 1 when compared with dropsonde observations. A momentum-budget analysis along a <b>curved</b> <b>locus</b> through <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jet has been derived. Off southeast Greenland, the easterly tip jet was in cross-jet geostrophic balance, but was being accelerated downstream by an along-jet pressure gradient. Over <b>the</b> <b>curved</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>locus,</b> as <b>the</b> jet rounded Cape Farewell, a cross-jet residual suggests that the jet was unbalanced at <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jet core. This residual decreases with height so that an approximate gradient wind balance applies in <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jet. The anticyclonic curvature, characteristic of easterly tip jets, {{was caused by a}} dramatic decrease in the cross-jet pressure-gradient force at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrier, after which the jet aligned with the synoptic-scale isobars and returned to approximate geostrophic balance. The momentum budget is shown to be robust and applicable to other cases...|$|R

40|$|We have {{examined}} the relationship between nuclear localization and transcriptional activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endogenous murine β-globin locus during erythroid differentiation. Murine fetal liver cells were separated into distinct erythroid maturation stages by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and <b>the</b> nuclear position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>locus</b> was determined at each stage. We find that <b>the</b> β-globin <b>locus</b> progressively moves away from the nuclear periphery with increasing maturation. Contrary to the prevailing notion that the nuclear periphery is a repressive compartment in mammalian cells, βmajor-globin expression begins at the nuclear periphery prior to relocalization. However, relocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>locus</b> to <b>the</b> nuclear interior with maturation is accompanied by an increase in βmajor-globin transcription. <b>The</b> distribution <b>of</b> nuclear polymerase II (Pol II) foci also changes with erythroid differentiation: Transcription factories decrease in number and contract toward the nuclear interior.
