Leadership was the most critical dimension, within which effective project teamwork capability was the most vital (Chen and Chang 2012). Therefore, effective project teamwork is required to design health information systems and promote and implement cloud computing service systems. Regarding cloud computing for electronic health services, a study identified crucial assessment factors by conducting a systematic literature review (Hage et al. 2013). Searches were conducted using the EBSCO 1, EBSCO 2, Embase, MUSE, and Web of Science databases and specific keywords, namely e-Health, e-care, tele*, ICT, information technology, communication technology, communication system, and information system. Of 5896 abstracts yielded by the keywords, 51 articles met {{the requirements of the}} researchers, enabling the identification of various dimensions including rural context, implementation process, e-Health <b>content,</b> <b>and</b> <b>adoption</b> outcomes (Hage et al. 2013). Related research indicated that the scalability of cloud computing platforms is a key factor for the successful application of such platforms in electronic health record systems, and this is because scalability determines the service quality (Vilaplana et al. 2013). Acknowledging the trend in cloud computing systems for health care, Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft 2014), which provides comprehensive cloud computing platforms, has developed related business models of health clouds; Microsoft Corporation stated three emphases for such systems: security and privacy, reliability, and flexibility and interoperability.|$|E
40|$|Studying {{information}} diffusion and {{the spread}} of goods in the real world and in many digital services can be extremely difficult since information about the information flows is challenging to accurately track. How information spreads has commonly been analysed from the perspective of homophily, social influence, and initial seed selection. However, in virtual worlds and virtual economies, the movements of information and goods can be precisely tracked. Therefore, these environments create laboratories for the accurate study of information diffusion characteristics that have been difficult to study in prior research. In this paper, we study how content visibility as well as sender and receiver characteristics, the relationship between them, and the types of multilayer social network layers affect <b>content</b> absorption <b>and</b> diffusion in virtual world.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the emergence of a paradigm of global justice, from its earliest expression by Jeremy Bentham in 1789 through to today, to Peter Singer's well known preference utilitarianism and Martha Nussbaum's less well known capabilities approach, with its emphasis on global justice. By providing a theoretically-determined, practically applicable set of capabilities for realising justice for animals, Nussbaum has made an important contribution to animal ethics, and one which is used in this article to assess the extent to which animal law satisfies the requirements of justice. The increasing momentum towards global justice parallels a complementary momentum towards the emergence of an increasingly "legalised" regulation of animal welfare. Although there is no general, federal animal welfare statute in Australia, the States and Territories have adopted codes of practice for the regulation of many aspects of animal welfare, and there is now a well-established national strategy which endorses consistency in the <b>content</b> <b>and</b> <b>adoption</b> of these codes. At an international level, no coherent animal protection regime has yet been established. However, a number of developments highlight an increasing legalisation of animal welfare protection. These include the regional initiatives of the European Union, the increased interest in animal welfare {{on the part of the}} World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) (including the endorsement of voluntary welfare codes) and the emergence of a campaign for a universal declaration on animal welfare. The central thesis of this article, though, is that these domestic and international regulatory developments fall well-short of realising the requirements for justice which flow from Nussbaum's capabilities approach. In order to contextualise the work of Nussbaum, Part I surveys some familiar ground by briefly tracing the development of the field of animal ethics, taking it up to the present day. Part II explores the capabilities approach of Nussbaum in some detail, elucidating how she extends the approach to include justice for animals. Having established the requirements for justice for animals suggested by the capabilities approach, Part III then assesses the extent to which domestic Australian law, and international law, satisfies these requirements.

40|$|Among {{the many}} {{initiatives}} in using {{information and communication}} technologies (ICTs) for development, telecenters or kiosks occupy a prominent place. These centers provide public access to these technologies and related services through computers and internet. The last decade has seen many such initiatives being launched to bring the benefits of ICTs to the rural population in many countries. As most of these initiatives are relatively recent, there have been few evaluations of their social and economic impacts in their communities. There is also lack of a good understanding about a sound conceptual and theoretical framework for planning and design of such centers. This study seeks to fill a portion of this information gap by focusing on assessing the social, governance, and economic impacts of one such relatively large project in rural India and examining its implications and sustainability {{within the framework of the}} theory of diffusion of innovations. The project under study is the widely acclaimed Sustainable Access in Rural India (SARI) project, which has established computer and internet kiosks in over 40 rural communities in Tamil Nadu state in India. The kiosks provide basic computer education, e-mail, web browsing, e-government, health, agricultural and veterinary services. There are four major findings that emerge from this study. First, though the kiosks have succeeded in establishing a visible presence in their communities, their overall reach is still limited. Their users are mostly school and college students, male, and come from a higher socioeconomic status when compared to that of their communities. In this sense, the kiosks may be leading to further exacerbation of the existing socioeconomic inequities within their communities. (cont.) Second, the kiosks have produced significant governance impacts through increased demand for, and improved delivery of, two e-government services: applications for birth certificates and old age pensions. This seems attributable to the relative advantage of using the kiosk for these services in terms of savings in costs, time, and effort when compared to those in the traditional modes of availing the same services. Third, the kiosks have also produced significant economic impacts through lowering the cost of some services, and creation of new economic and employment opportunities. The services whose costs have been brought down include basic computer education, communication (through email and voice chat), and e-government services. New economic and employment opportunities have been generated by providing computer education to the local youth, and enabling access to online information about jobs. Fourth, the study points out the relevance of the socio-cultural relationships among various castes in the diffusion of kiosks. It points out the importance of location of the kiosks, affordability of the services, relevant and localized <b>content,</b> <b>and</b> <b>adoption</b> and use by local champions within the communities to ensure and sustain their wide diffusion. It also analyzes the potential of providing new services which could be crucial in the financial sustainability of the kiosks. Importance of developing and maintaining new institutional partnerships is also emphasized to ensure relative advantage in the delivery of services [...] . by Rajendra Kumar. Thesis (M. C. P.)

40|$|Abstract- The Web {{today has}} become the most used and popular {{platform}} for application development. In the beginnings of the Web, applications provided users just ability to browse <b>and</b> read <b>content.</b> The expansion <b>and</b> <b>adoption</b> of the new web technologies has led to a significant increase in development and, more importantly, usage of the web applications that allow users to create their own <b>content</b> <b>and</b> impact their life (e. g. e-banking, e-commerce, social networks). Web 2. 0 applications introduced new possibilities for both users and application developers, but also created new security concerns. Almost every Internet user uses a web browser to access any content on the Internet. Each web application is designed and developed to be executed inside the web browser. Web browser mediates between users and applications. In such architecture, malicious applications could be loaded and executed inside the web browser, making it a vulnerable point in preserving security. Modern web applications demand for a new web browser architecture design that will meet new security requirements arisen with the Web 2. 0. In this paper, we study web browser's vulnerabilities, analyze popular web browsers architecture and present how they cope with potential security threats. I...|$|R

This has prompted a search for ways to increase Internet <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> narrow its disparity across countries – the global “digital divide. ” Previous work has focused on demographic, economic, and infrastructure determinants of Internet access difficult {{to change in the}} short run. Internet <b>content</b> increases <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> can be changed more quickly; however, the magnitude of its impact and therefore its effectiveness as a policy and strategy tool is previously unknown. Quantifying content’s role is challenging because of feedback (network effects) between <b>content</b> <b>and</b> adoption: more <b>content</b> stimulates adoption which in turn increases the incentive to create content. We develop a methodology to overcome this endogeneity problem. We find a statistically and economically significant effect, implying that policies promoting content creation can substantially increase adoption. Because it is ubiquitous, Internet content is also useful to affect social change across countries. Content has a greater effect on adoption in countries with more disparate languages, making it a useful tool to overcome linguistic isolation. Our results offer guidance for policy makers on country characteristics that influence adoption’s responsiveness to <b>content</b> <b>and</b> for Internet firms on where to expand internationally and how to quantify content investments.

The issue of codes of conduct is becoming increasingly important in the twenty-first century because, as the life sciences continue to advance rapidly, scientists need to be more aware of concerns over the misuse of science and technology. In the words of the Interacademy Panel on International Issues, “…scientific research has created new and unexpected knowledge and technologies that offer unprecedented opportunities to improve human and animal health and environmental conditions. But some science and technology can be used for destructive purposes as well as for constructive purposes. Scientists have a special responsibility when it comes to problems of ‘dual use’ and the misuse of science and technology” (IAP, 2005). After the conclusion of the States Parties' Meeting in December 2005, the BTWC Secretariat stated: “States Parties recognised that codes of conduct can support the [BTWC] in combating present and future threats posed by biological and toxin weapons. States Parties noted that a range of different approaches exist to develop codes of conduct in view of differences in national requirements and circumstances”, and added that “Codes were considered to be most effective if they and their underlying principles are widely known and understood” (United Nations, 2005 b) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} modeling of factors concerning microblogging users 2 ̆ 7 <b>content</b> <b>and</b> behavior. We focus on {{two sets of}} factors. The first set includes behavioral factors of users <b>and</b> <b>content</b> items driving content propagation in microblogging. The second set consists of latent topics and communities of users as the users are engaged in <b>content</b> generation <b>and</b> behavior <b>adoptions.</b> These two sets of factors are extremely important in many applications, e. g., network monitoring and recommender systems. In {{the first part of}} this dissertation, we identify user virality, user susceptibility, <b>and</b> <b>content</b> virality as three behavioral factors that affect users 2 ̆ 7 behaviors in content propagation. User virality refers to the ability of a user in getting her content propagated by many other users, while user susceptibility refers to the tendency of a user to propagate other users 2 ̆ 7 content. Content virality refers to the tendency of a content item to attract propagation by users. Instead of modeling these factors independently as done in previous research, we propose to jointly model all these factors considering their inter-relationships. We develop static, temporal, and incremental models for measuring the factors based on propagation data. We also develop a static model for modeling the factors specific to topics. In the second part of this dissertation, we develop topic models for learning users 2 ̆ 7 topical interest and communities from both their <b>content</b> <b>and</b> behavior. We first propose a model to derive community affiliations of users using topics and sentiments expressed in their content as well as their behavior. We then extend the model to learn both users 2 ̆ 7 personal interest and that of their communities, distinguishing the two types of interests. Our model also learns the bias of users toward their communities when generating <b>content</b> <b>and</b> adopting behavior. 024...|$|R

However, the quality of information provided by these sites is highly variable <b>and</b> allows unreliable <b>contents</b> <b>and</b> pages that are subject to specific interests to develop. In a sample of personal websites, websites of public and private institutions, and health research organizations, the study analyzed the level of compliance with quality standards related to the content management, promoted by the Accreditation Program of Health Websites, of the Andalusian Agency for Health Care Quality (ACSA). Taking a random sample of health content websites, the level of compliance was analyzed with a set of quality standards related to: the sources of information, authorship, selection, assessment and update of information, contained in this Accreditation Program of Health Websites. Considering the level of compliance with these requirements a critical analysis of the standards handbook, which is the basis of the accreditation program, was carried out. The most frequent user queries and the discrepancies between responses (in terms of standards compliance) were examined. From the results of this first phase, a committee of experts was set up, with the purpose of discussing matters related to <b>content</b> management <b>and</b> defining standards for the quality control of these contents aimed at increasing the reliability for users who use health websites. In 2010, a new manual was designed to redefine standards and evidence in order to ensure that health websites analyzed by the accreditation program are sources of accurate, proven, reliable and user appropriate information. The demand for online health information requires the continuous updating of resources to improve the quality of web <b>contents</b> <b>and</b> the <b>adoption</b> of control <b>and</b> security measures that give the user certain guarantees.

40|$|In {{the late}} twentieth century {{international}} trade moved from a political multi-polar system based on the nation-state to a system featuring unified regional trading regimes. An inevitable feature of increased cooperation through bilateral, regional and international arrangements is the emergence of disputes over the interpretation and implementation of the agreed upon commitments. Accordingly, reliable mechanisms for the settlement of trade related disputes have become necessary to ensure the effective and continued functioning of these arrangements. Over the years these dispute settlement mechanisms have evolved from the relatively simple, diplomacy based structures called for in the GATT, to the detailed, legalistic, adjudication based mechanism found in the WTO. Bilateral and regional initiatives, such as NAFTA and MERCOSUR, as well as the EU, have similarly adopted dispute settlement mechanisms which adopt, in varying degrees, legalistic adjudicatory processes. Since 1967 ASEAN has spearheaded the creation of a regional trading bloc in the South East Asian region. As in other trading blocs, this has inevitable led to the need to develop effective and workable dispute settlement mechanisms. This thesis examines the development of trade dispute settlement mechanisms in ASEAN tracing its development from a model based on pragmatic diplomacy to a legalistic adjudicatory system with particular reference to the ASEAN context.
