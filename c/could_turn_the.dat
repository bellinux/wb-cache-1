5|$|Holland Arms' {{functionality}} {{as a staff}} {{station was}} only useful for the Red Wharf Bay branch, but a signalman was still required for all Amlwch services. In about 1925, LMS introduced a switching-out system that <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> Gaerwen-Holland Arms and Holland Arms-Llangefni sections into one long section. This was of particular advantage in early mornings and evenings, when the only services were on the Amlwch line.|$|E
5|$|Mid-way in the march, Frederick finally {{realized}} that he would end up facing his enemy, instead of approaching from behind. Furthermore, a row of ponds forced him to break his line into three narrow columns, exposing it to full Russian fire power. Frederick changed his dispositions; the Prussian right vanguard would concentrate east of the ponds of Kunersdorf and make {{an assault on the}} Mühlberge. Frederick calculated that he <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> Austrian-Russian flank, and push the Russians off the Mühlberge heights. His redeployment took time, and the apparent hesitation in the assault confirmed to Saltykov what Frederick planned; he moved more troops around so that the strongest line would face the Prussian onslaught.|$|E
5|$|While {{the weather}} was fine, the wind whipped up {{to such an extent}} at pitch level that the ball was taken out of its proper flight on occasion. In the third minute Sheffield United were nearly a goal up after Arsenal goalkeeper Wilson dropped the ball to the ground and fumbled at it trying to pick it up. United players Barclay and Dodds both charged in to take advantage, but an Arsenal defender cleared the ball away before they <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} into a goal. During the first fifteen minutes, United were the superior team with the work of their forwards only failing against the work of Arsenal's full backs and goalkeeper with Wilson continuing to looking not entirely safe. Arsenal's defenders eventually settled with Crayston and Copping stepping up for their team.|$|E

5|$|Ba {{asserted}} {{that he would}} not take orders from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 armored personnel carriers through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the Viet Cong to retreat because it might take too much time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told him to ask the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba to move toward Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterwards, Ziegler returned with Dam's permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers {{in the direction of the}} white smoke that was rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba's M113s <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> tide of battle; on previous occasions, Viet Cong fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 armored personnel carriers turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, Viet Cong commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything they had at the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E
5|$|England {{maintained}} their newly confident approach, being on top {{for most of}} the fourth Test. Yardley's men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38, Yardley contributing two wickets. England increased their lead by 365 before Yardley declared. He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day, allowing him to use the heavy roller to quicken the break-up of the pitch. Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes, a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match. In addition, the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> ball sharply. However, England made several errors: Godfrey Evans, the England wicket-keeper had a bad day and missed some stumping chances; three catches were dropped by fielders, and England's only specialist spinner, Jim Laker, bowled poorly. Consequently, Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton's bowling. Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen, Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as effective as a front line spinner. Yardley seemed unsure of the best course of action as Bradman and Arthur Morris added 301 runs for the second wicket; he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton, who was hit for 30 runs in four overs, although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton's bowling. The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers, but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball. Australia won by seven wickets; the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day. Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win; he believed that Yardley used Hutton's bowling to encourage the tourists to take risks against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring, but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long. Wisden also stated that England should have won the match.|$|E

He keeps him pinned down, probing and probing until the victim is well and truly enmeshed.|$|E

They acted through the media to impose a set of restrictions on overt public displays of mourning for Zhou. Years of resentment over the Cultural Revolution, the public persecution of Deng Xiaoping (seen as Zhou's ally), and the prohibition against public mourning led to a rise in popular discontent against Mao and the Gang of Four.|$|E
25|$|Some clocks have a timing {{adjustment}} (a fast-slow control). When {{the owner}} compared his wall clock's {{time to the}} reference time, he noticed that his clock was too fast. Consequently, he <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> timing adjust a small amount to make the clock run a little slower (frequency). If things work out right, his clock will be more accurate than before. Over a series of weekly adjustments, the wall clock's notion of a second would agree with the reference time (locked both in frequency and phase within the wall clock's stability).|$|E
25|$|In March 1948, David Ben-Gurion ordered Ze'ev HaYam (literally, Sea Wolf), one of {{the main}} figures in Israel's early navy and {{merchant}} marine, to go to Italy to find ships that could be procured for the naval service. While Ze'ev HaYam procured two large motor boats and two landing craft, he wanted to acquire the Decima Flottiglia MAS's MT explosive motorboats that had been used in the Raid on Souda Bay to ram into and destroy larger ships. Ze'ev HaYam believed that these boats <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> tide of the war. With the help of a relative and Ben-Gurion's consent, he bought six refurbished boats for $3,000 each from an ailing factory, and while the factory owners were told what the boats were for, to the outside they were disguised as racing boats.|$|E

25|$|To {{complete}} the system, an electronic switch was added that was timed to the 50Hz signal of the National Grid. The signal {{was used to}} switch the input to the receivers from the range antenna, to output {{of the other two}} antennas mixed through the radiogoniometer. The same signal also adjusted the Y-axis bias of the CRT slightly, so that alternate traces appeared above or below the center of a new CRT dedicated for elevation measurements. The result was that the upper trace contained the original range signal as before, while the lower trace contained the radiogoniometer output; by looking along the lower trace under the range blip, the operator <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> radiogoniometer until the signal reached a null, revealing the angle. The operator would periodically adjust the setting as the lower blip re-appeared while the target moved.|$|E
25|$|Early on March 31, 1865, Union Major General Philip Sheridan told Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant that he {{believed}} he <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> Confederate right or make a breakthrough if the rain stopped {{and he had the}} help of an infantry corps. Sheridan wanted the VI Corps commanded by Major General Horatio G. Wright, which he had worked with in the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864, not the V Corps under Major General Gouverneur Warren whom Sheridan did not trust. Grant replied a few hours later that the VI Corps was {{in the center of the}} line and too far away to support Sheridan but he could move the II Corps by the next day. Grant also said that Wright thought he could go through the line from his current position. Although heavy rain continued that day, Confederate Major General George E. Pickett was about to change the situation and options of the Union commanders.|$|E
25|$|At Clough's {{first team}} talk, he {{reportedly}} told the Leeds players to throw their medals away, {{as they had}} won them by cheating. He also antagonised several senior players, including captain Billy Bremner and Norman Hunter, and reportedly told the injury-prone Eddie Gray {{that if he had}} been a horse, he would have been shot years ago. Clough purchased players who he felt <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> dressing room such as John O'Hare and John McGovern from Derby County, and thrust them into the team ahead of the established players who were lukewarm to his appointment. Clough's first match in charge was the 1974 FA Charity Shield against Liverpool at Wembley Stadium; Leeds lost on penalties after a 1–1 draw, but the match is best remembered for Bremner and Kevin Keegan being sent off for fighting. The FA imposed an 11 match ban on Bremner. Deprived of his captain, Clough's tenure was further hampered by injuries to numerous first team players. Leeds' start to the league campaign was poor, with just one victory and two draws from his first six games, leaving the club 19th in the First Division.|$|E

25|$|The large troop {{movements}} these withdrawals and reinforcements required caused a substantial reorganisation of the EEF. Until September, when Allenby's force {{would be completely}} reformed and retrained, {{it would not be}} in a position to successfully attack both the Transjordan on the right and the Plain of Sharon on the left as well as continuing to hold the centre in the Judean Hills. In the meantime, it seemed essential to occupy the Transjordan to establish closer ties with Britain's important Arab ally, Feisal and the Hejaz Arabs. Until direct contact was made, Allenby could not completely support this force and he knew that if Feisal was defeated, German and Ottoman forces <b>could</b> <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> whole length of the EEF's right flank. This would make their hard-won positions shaky all the way to Jerusalem, and could result in a humiliating withdrawal, possibly to Egypt. Apart from the extremely important military ramifications of such a loss of captured territory, the political fallout could include a negative effect on the Egyptian population, upon whose cooperation the British war effort relied heavily. Allenby hoped that a series of attacks into the hills of Moab could turn Ottoman attention away from the Plain of Sharon, north of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast, to the important railway junction at Daraa which, if captured by T.E. Lawrence and Feisal, would seriously dislocate the Ottoman railway and lines of communication in Palestine.|$|E
