5|$|The North American {{river otter}} is more social than most mustelids. In all habitats, their basic social {{group is the}} family, {{consisting}} of an adult female and her progeny. Adult males also commonly establish enduring social groupings, some documented to comprise as many as 17 individuals. In coastal areas, males may remain gregarious even during the estrous period of females. Family groups may include helpers, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of unrelated adults, yearlings, or juveniles.|$|E

25|$|Both the {{hyperboloid}} of one {{sheet and}} the hyperbolic paraboloid are ruled surfaces, {{meaning that they}} <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> {{from a family of}} straight lines. In fact, each has two families of generating lines, the members of each family are disjoint and each member one family intersects, with just one exception, every member of the other family.

25|$|During lower flows the Trent and {{its tributaries}} are heavily {{influenced}} by effluent returns from sewage works, especially the Tame where summer flows <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of 90% effluent. For the Trent this proportion is lower, but with nearly half of low flows being made up of these effluent inflows, it is still significant. There are also baseflow contributions from the major aquifers in the catchment.|$|E
25|$|From {{the western}} side of Whinlatter Pass a {{pleasant}} approach <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> the wooded Aiken Valley, a quiet dale with no vehicular access. The summit of the pass also provides access, either direct via Ullister Hill, or by first climbing Whinlatter and then following the ridge. From the main road along the shore of Bassenthwaite a path can be followed beside Beckstones Gill, climbing just inside the forest. This is an easier alternative to the rough face of Barf.|$|E

25|$|Transponder – In practice, {{the signal}} {{inputs and outputs}} will not be {{electrical}} but optical instead (typically at 1550nm). This means that in effect wavelength converters are needed instead, {{which is exactly what}} a transponder is. A transponder <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of two transceivers placed after each other: the first transceiver converting the 1550nm optical signal to/from an electrical signal, and the second transceiver converting the electrical signal to/from an optical signal at the required wavelength. Transponders that don't use an intermediate electrical signal (all-optical transponders) are in development.|$|E

Tea cakes {{or other}} {{compressed}} pu'er <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> {{of two or}} more grades of tea, typically with higher grade leaves {{on the outside of the}} cake and lower grades or broken leaves in the center. This is done to improve the appearance of the tea cake and improve its sale. Predicting the grade of tea used on the inside takes some effort and experience in selection. However, the area in and around the dimple of the tea cake can sometimes reveal the quality of the inner leaves.|$|E
500|$|Diamond {{can be one}} single, {{continuous}} crystal or it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of {{many smaller}} crystals (polycrystal). Large, clear and transparent single-crystal diamonds are typically used in gemstones. Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) consists of numerous small grains, which are easily seen by the naked eye through strong light absorption and scattering; it is unsuitable for gems and is used for industrial applications such as mining and cutting tools. Polycrystalline diamond is often described by the average size (or grain size) of the crystals that make it up. Grain sizes range from nanometers to hundreds of micrometers, usually referred to as [...] "nanocrystalline" [...] and [...] "microcrystalline" [...] diamond, respectively.|$|E
50|$|It is {{required}} that TD is constant at all frequencies over {{the band of}} operation. φ must therefore be kept linearly proportional to ω. With suitable choice of parameters, the network phase shift <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> linear <b>up</b> to about 180° phase shift.|$|R

2500|$|Drummond's {{most recent}} music {{project is a}} choir called The17. His first formal {{performance}} of The17 was staged with 16 other men in a studio in Leicester in 2004. It followed thoughts about music that Drummond had been having for many years. With the advent of recorded music via the internet, iPods and MP3 players etc. Drummond proclaims that [...] "all recorded music has run its course." [...] The17 creates music that follows no musical history, or necessarily has words, melodies or rhythms. It may {{be made up of}} many human voices or none. Performances may only be recorded and played back once and then deleted. The17 <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of as many people who {{want to be a part}} of it at the time of a performance; they are all then lifetime members.|$|E
2500|$|Shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} consist of series of tubes. One set of these tubes contains the fluid {{that must be}} either heated or cooled. The second fluid runs over the tubes that are being heated or cooled {{so that it can}} either provide the heat or absorb the heat required. A set of tubes is called the tube bundle and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of several types of tubes: plain, longitudinally finned, etc. Shell and tube {{heat exchangers}} are typically used for high-pressure applications (with pressures greater than 30 bar and temperatures greater than 260°C). This is because the shell and tube heat exchangers are robust due to their shape.Several thermal design features must be considered when designing the tubes in the shell and tube heat exchangers: ...|$|E
2500|$|Different {{types of}} seed coats <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> of living or dead cells, and both types can be {{influenced}} by hormones; those composed of living cells are acted upon after seed formation, whereas the seed coats composed of dead cells can {{be influenced by}} hormones during {{the formation of the}} seed coat. [...] ABA affects testa or seed coat growth characteristics, including thickness, and effects the GA-mediated embryo growth potential. These conditions and effects occur during the formation of the seed, often in response to environmental conditions. Hormones also mediate endosperm dormancy: Endosperm in most seeds is composed of living tissue that can actively respond to hormones generated by the embryo. The endosperm often acts as a barrier to seed germination, playing a part in seed coat dormancy or in the germination process. [...] Living cells respond to and also affect the ABA:GA ratio, and mediate cellular sensitivity; GA thus increases the embryo growth potential and can promote endosperm weakening. GA also affects both ABA-independent and ABA-inhibiting processes within the endosperm.|$|E
