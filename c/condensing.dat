5|$|Although flat designs {{have the}} benefit of simplicity, other designs such as {{inverted}} pyramids and cones can be significantly more effective. This is probably because the designs shield the <b>condensing</b> surfaces from unwanted heat radiated by the lower atmosphere, and, being symmetrical, they are not sensitive to wind direction.|$|E

5|$|The leading {{area of a}} {{squall line}} is {{composed}} primarily of multiple updrafts, or singular regions of an updraft, rising from ground level to the highest extensions of the troposphere, <b>condensing</b> water and building a dark, ominous cloud to one with a noticeable overshooting top and anvil (thanks to synoptic scale winds). Because of the chaotic nature of updrafts and downdrafts, pressure perturbations are important.|$|E
5|$|When {{the line}} reopened in 1907 just one {{locomotive}} was used. This was a Beyer Peacock 4-4-0T built in 1879 for the Metropolitan Railway in London, it was number 37 of their A Class <b>condensing</b> locomotives.

50|$|Steam-electric {{power plants}} utilize a surface <b>condenser</b> cooled by water {{circulating}} through tubes.

5|$|Earth is {{estimated}} to have formed 4.54billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed roughly 20million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. <b>Condensing</b> water vapor, {{most or all of}} which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|From 1891, more {{locomotives}} {{were needed}} {{for work on}} the extension line from Baker Street into the country. Four C Class (0-4-4) locomotives, a development of South Eastern Railway's 'Q' Class, were received in 1891. In 1894, two D Class locomotives were bought to run between Aylesbury and Verney Junction. These were not fitted with the <b>condensing</b> equipment needed to work south of Finchley Road. Four more were delivered in 1895 with <b>condensing</b> equipment, although these were prohibited working south of Finchley Road. In 1896, two E Class (0-4-4) locomotives were built at Neasden works, followed by one in 1898 to replace the original Class A No. 1, damaged in an accident. Four more were built by Hawthorn Leslie & Co in 1900 and 1901. To cope with the growing freight traffic on the extension line, the Met received four F Class (0-6-2) locomotives in 1901, similar to the E Class except for the wheel arrangement and without steam heat. In 1897 and 1899, the Met received two 0-6-0 saddle tank locomotives to a standard Peckett design. Unclassified by the Met, these were generally used for shunting at Neasden and Harrow.|$|E
5|$|Neon is {{abundant}} on a universal scale; {{it is the}} fifth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon (see chemical element). Its relative rarity on Earth, like that of helium, is due to its relative lightness, high vapor pressure at very low temperatures, and chemical inertness, all properties which tend {{to keep it from}} being trapped in the <b>condensing</b> gas and dust clouds that formed the smaller and warmer solid planets like Earth.|$|E

5|$|No.A816 {{emerged from}} Eastleigh in August 1931 for trials, but was stopped when {{temperature}} variations within the <b>condensing</b> equipment caused water leakage.

No.A816 was released for more trials, and produced performances well-below those displayed by the unmodified members of the class. The experiment was ended when the system's developers ran out of money, and the locomotive was converted back to standard form between May and August 1935, re-entering service as No.1816.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2006, a {{large white}} plume of <b>condensing</b> steam was observed, leading some media people to assume {{there had been a}} small eruption.

40|$|In {{power plant}} {{locations}} with adequate supply of cooling water the steam from the steam turbine is <b>condensed</b> {{in a water}} cooled <b>condenser.</b> In most instances circulating water from the cooling tower is used to <b>condense</b> the turbine exhaust steam. In other instances once through cooling is deployed wherein water from a lake, river or sea is used to <b>condense</b> the turbine exhaust steam. In water challenged locations or locations where wet cooling cannot be deployed due to permitting or regulatory issues, the steam from the steam turbine is <b>condensed</b> in an air cooled <b>condenser</b> (ACC) wherein ambient air is used to cool and <b>condense</b> the turbine exhaust steam. In a combined cycle plant, during normal operation, the water or air cooled <b>condenser</b> <b>condenses</b> the turbine exhaust steam. During bypass operation, when the steam turbine is out of service, the high-pressure steam from the HRSG is attemperated in a pressure reducing/desuperheating (PRD) valve and then admitted into the water cooled or air cooled <b>condenser.</b> The bypass steam flow is substantially higher than the design turbine exhaust steam flow and the duration of bypass operation can vary from {{a few hours to}} several weeks. The requirements for admission of bypass steam into a water cooled <b>condenser</b> are substantially different from that for an air cooled <b>condenser.</b> In a water cooled <b>condenser</b> the bypass steam is admitted in the steam dome. The bypass steam as well as the turbine exhaust steam is <b>condensed</b> outside the tubes. In an air cooled <b>condenser</b> the bypass steam is admitted in the large diameter steam duct. The bypass, as well as the turbine exhaust steam (normal operation), is <b>condensed</b> inside the tubes.

5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the heat output, so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas <b>condensing</b> furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E

5|$|On 24 July, the {{squadron}} {{moved to a}} satellite airfield at Rochford in the county of Essex. The following day, he became operational. The Battle of Britain was slowly escalating and air fighting increased {{with a series of}} German air attacks against British shipping in the English Channel, a phase of the battle termed Kanalkampf by the Luftwaffe. Finucane's first scramble came on 25 July 1940. Flying Spitfire N3128 code YT-W, he took off at 08:45. The Spitfire was worn, having served in combat since April. It developed a glycol leak whilst climbing and the cockpit filled with escaping vapour from the cooling liquid <b>condensing</b> on the hot engine. Suddenly his radio transmission failed. Still, he managed a wheels-up landing at Rochford. 65 Squadron was in action again at 12:20 and engaged enemy aircraft but suffered no losses.|$|E

5|$|The {{most stable}} and dense form of {{selenium}} is gray {{and has a}} hexagonal crystal lattice consisting of helical polymeric chains, where the Se-Se distance is 237.3pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 130.1°. The minimum distance between chains is 343.6pm. Gray Se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten Se, or by <b>condensing</b> Se vapor just below the melting point. Whereas other Se forms are insulators, gray Se is a semiconductor showing appreciable photoconductivity. Unlike the other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS2. It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing acids. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.|$|E
