500|$|Roguelikes {{generally}} have complex interacting systems {{that allow the}} player to complete certain goals in multiple ways, creating emergent gameplay. For example, {{to get through a}} locked door, the player may attempt to pick the lock, kick it down, burn down the door, or even tunnel around it, depending on their current situation and inventory. A common phrase associated with NetHack is [...] "The Dev Team Thinks of Everything" [...] in that the developers seem to have anticipated every possible <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> that a player may attempt to try in their gameplay strategy, such as using gloves to protect one's character while wielding the corpse of a cockatrice as a weapon to petrify enemies by its touch.|$|E

60|$|The {{growth of}} a thing is {{effected}} by the joint operation of certain forces on certain materials; and when it dwindles, there is either a lack of some materials, or the forces co-operate in a way different from that which produces growth. If a structure has varied, {{the implication is that}} the processes which built it up were made unlike the parallel processes in other cases, by the greater or less amount of some {{one or more of the}} matters or actions concerned. Where there is unusual fertility, the play of vital activities is thereby shown to have deviated from the ordinary play of vital activities; and conversely, if there is infertility. If the germs, or ova, or seed, or offspring partially developed, survive more or survive less, it is either because their molar or molecular structures are unlike the average ones, or because they are affected in unlike ways by surrounding agencies. When life is prolonged, the fact implies that the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions,</b> visible and invisible, constituting life, retains its equilibrium longer than usual in presence of environing forces which tend to destroy its equilibrium. That is to say, growth, variation, survival, death, if they are to be reduced to the forms in which physical science can recognize them, must be expressed as effects of agencies definitely conceived--mechanical forces, light, heat, chemical affinity, &c.|$|E

50|$|Apposition of {{the thumb}} is a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> {{that allows the}} tip of the thumb to touch the tips of other fingers. The part of {{apposition}} that this muscle is responsible for is the flexion of the thumb's metacarpal at the first carpometacarpal joint. This specific action cups the palm. Many texts, for simplicity, use the term opposition to represent this component of true apposition. In order to truly appose the thumb, the actions of a number of other muscles are needed at the thumb's metacarpophalangeal joint. Note that the two opponens muscles (opponens pollicis and opponens digiti minimi) are named so because they oppose each other, but their actions appose (yes, with an 'a') the bones (bring them toward each other).|$|E
