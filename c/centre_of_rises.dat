5000|$|Under the {{policies}} initiated by late Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and his then-Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, India's economy expanded rapidly. The economic reforms were {{a reaction to}} an impending balance of payment crisis. The Rao administration initiated the privatisation of large, inefficient, and loss-inducing government corporations. The UF government had attempted a progressive budget that encouraged reforms, but the 1997 Asian financial crisis and political instability created economic stagnation. The Vajpayee administration continued with privatisation, reduction of taxes, a sound fiscal policy aimed at reducing deficits and debts, and increased initiatives for public works.

60|$|THE Christian convents {{form one}} of the most {{remarkable}} features of modern Jerusalem. There are three principal ones; the Latin Convent of Terra Santa, founded, it is believed, during the last crusade, and richly endowed by the kings of Christendom; the Armenian and the Greek convents, whose revenues are also considerable, but derived from the numerous pilgrims of their different churches, who annually visit the Holy Sepulchre, and generally during their sojourn reside within the walls of their respective religious houses. To be competent to supply such accommodation, it will easily be apprehended that they are of considerable size. They are in truth monastic establishments of the first class, as large as citadels, and almost as strong. Lofty stone walls enclose an area of acres, in the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> which <b>rises</b> an irregular mass of buildings and enclosures; courts of all shapes, galleries of cells, roofs, terraces, gardens, corridors, churches, houses, and even streets.

40|$|The present paper deals {{mainly with}} the normal {{developmental}} process of a Hydrozoa, Nemopsis dofleini. The cleavage pattern is irregular radial and coeloblastula is formed. The gastrulation will start with unipolar ingression and continue with mixed ingression and delamination. This {{lead to a}} ciliated planula which is solidly packed with cells. The planulae show a characteristic behaviour and their morphological change before settlement can be seen within several days after the first cleavage. They adhere to a substratum with anterior (aboral) mouth part, then settle. The settled planula becomes flattened disk, giving rise to polyp {{in such a way}} in which the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> disk <b>rises</b> as a rod. On the other hand, the cell number and the volume of the developing embryos were examined. During the stages from cleavage to early planula, the embryos show the marked increase in cell number and the marked decrease in average cell volume but they keep the substantial volume constant. While, during the planulan life, the contrary situation is noted that the cell number and the cell volume do not increase appreciably, but the volume of whole individual increases more than double. From the results some problems on the developmental process are discussed. 本論文はドフラインクラゲの卵割からポリプ形成までの過程について外形的・組織的及び定量的に調べた最初の仕事である。卵割は放射不等割で,有腔胞胚となる。陥入は単極移入で始まるが,多極移入と葉裂も加わって胞胚腔はうずまり,繊毛をそなえたプラヌラとなる。プラヌラは発育に応じて形と回転運動様式を変え,基質への固着に成功したものは中央部を突出してポリプとなる。プラヌラまでの体積・細胞数の変化も調べ発生過程についての若干の問題について論議した...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} laser {{to provide}} {{localised}} heating is an ideal {{solution to the problem}} of packaging micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) whilst maintaining a low device temperature to avoid changes in temperature-sensitive materials in the device. In this paper we present localised laser bonding of glass to silicon (normally used as the MEMS substrate) by using a fibre-delivered high power laser diode array to cure an intermediate layer of the thermosetting polymer Benzocyclobutene (BCB). In our experiments, we use two techniques to realise localised heating: one is to use an axicon together with a conventional positive lens to generate a ring focus; the other is to use a scanning focused laser beam. In both cases localised cooling is required to confine the elevated temperatures to the bonding area. Finite Element (FE) simulation indicates that both techniques should keep the temperature in the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the package to approximately that of the ambient environment (300 K) during the process. However, experiments show that the temperature in the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> the package <b>rises</b> to a value of around 500 K, likely due to poor contact between silicon and cooling sink. Experimentally, we confirmed that either technique can be used to obtain excellent bonding of glass to silicon with leak rate at a level of 10 − 10 mbar l s− 1, whilst keeping the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> device at a lower temperature...|$|R
