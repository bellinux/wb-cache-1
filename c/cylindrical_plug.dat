30|$|Although {{classical}} OAT mosaicplasty has favorable clinical outcomes, gap {{spaces between}} the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> which end up with fibrocartilage filling remain as an issue to solve. When the coverage of a standard area with equally sized <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> is calculated it can only cover 80  % of the defect. Radulescu et al. reported in their histological study the mean HC ratio of the treated area as 70  % (Rădulescu et al. 2008). In case {{of the use of}} differently sized plugs the gap spaces area can be reduced but cannot be eliminated (Hangody et al. 2004). There are a number of studies focused on the gap spaces. Ma et al. combined OAT mosaicplasty with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell in their experimental animal study and concluded that this combination promotes integration of dead spaces between plugs (Ma et al. 2015). Chen concluded that tissue-engineered cartilage tissue can promote the integration of dead spaces between round plugs in their animal study (Chen 2014). The hexagonal design has intended to solve the gap interspace issue between the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> used in classical OAT mosaicplasty with changing the geometry of the autologous plugs. In the nature the honey bees produce their hive in combination of hexagonal cells. In 1999 Hales proved mathematically that hexagonal geometry is the way of build a construct with minimum amount of material without gaps (Hales 1999). Thus, the HOGS provides hexagonal arrangement with hexagonal prism shaped plugs which can be easily harvested and placed to the defect area with same surgical steps as in classical OAT mosaicplasty. Therefore we can presume that the learning curve of this technique would be short. Eventually, we observed in our study that application of OAT mosaicplasty with the new HOGS has no difference in surgical exposure and steps of the surgical procedure. However, the preparation step of the cartilage lesion has technically more difficult than harvesting the graft. Nevertheless, it was possible to align hexagonal prism shaped grafts without leaving interspaces in the defect area {{with the help of the}} geometrical nature of hexagons and obtain higher levels of coverage. We revealed according to these subjective observations HOGS can be an option to solve the gap space issue faced during the classical OAT mosaicplasty. But, it is obvious that future clinical or experimental studies have to prove the tissue quality of the cartilage tissue at the end of the treatment.|$|R

40|$|Six ball plugs {{were used}} to seal the oil lines in Jaguar {{cylinder}} heads using the press-fit process. The balls were made out of the 7075 Al alloy and were produced by forging, whereas the heads were made from the 319 Al alloy and were low pressure cast at the Essex Aluminum Plant (EAP), and machined at the Cleveland Engine Plant (CEP). The ball plugs were inserted at the CEP. Leaking was observed through the ball plugs during the CEP engine quality control operation. An investigation was launched to determine and eliminate {{the cause of the}} leaks. In order to isolate the main leak culprits, tests were subdivided into sections, which included: the heat treatment parameters applied to the 319 Al cylinder heads; metallurgical and geometrical characterization of the ball plug including: ball and casting microstructural analysis, hardness and homogeneity analysis, casting scratch and compression tests, characterization of the ball/casting hole wall interface, ball plug insertion and pressure tightness tests, effect of the insertion speed, ball lubrication and casting microhardness on the insertion force; geometrical investigation of the cylinder head boss design; leak mechanisms SEM/EDS investigation, as well as the Finite Element Analysis of the stress distribution in the ball and cylinder plug systems.

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a large molecule with {{an important role in}} cartilage growth and metabolism, however, it first must reach the chondrocytes to exert its effect. While diffusion of IGF-I through cartilage is possible, it has been speculated that cyclic loading can enhance the rate of solute transport within cartilage.

In this work, injection assays {{have been carried out}} with fluids comprising microemulsion-based commercial anionic surfactants, oil from the Quiambina Field (mature field in the Brazilian State of Bahia) and brine (2 % KCl). The experiments basically consisted of the injection of fluids into <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plug</b> samples from the Botucatu formation by means of conventional (injection of water or brine) and enhanced (injection of microemulsion) recovery techniques. During water and microemulsion flooding, samples were collected as a function of time, after which the volume of oil recovered was obtained. Parameters like mobility ratio, volume of displaceable oil, volume of displaced oil and displacement efficiency have been obtained as results. It was verified that lower mobility ratios were acquired with the injection of microemulsion than with injection of water, thereby favoring oil recovery. The volume of oil displaced by the microemulsion corresponded to 75 % of the total displaceable oil, which is a much higher yield than that observed in conventional recovery procedures. The results showed that, when microemulsion flooding is applied, the displacement efficiency is 21. 5 %, whereas with the conventional method the efficiency is 41 %.

The device (see figure) includes a circular tube sharpened at its open (lower) end and mounted on a robotic manipulator at its closed (upper) end. The robotic manipulator simply pushes the sharpened open end of the tube down onto a bed of plants and rotates a few degrees clockwise then counterclockwise about the vertical axis, causing the tube to cut a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plug</b> of plant material. Exploiting the natural friction between the tube and plug, the tube retains the plug, without need for a gripping mechanism and control. The robotic manipulator then retracts the tube, translates it to a new location over a plant-growth tray, and inserts the tube part way into the growth medium at this location in the tray. A short burst of compressed air is admitted to the upper end of the tube to eject the plug of plant material and drive it into the growth medium. A prototype has been tested and verified to function substantially as intended. It is projected that in the fully developed robotic plant-propagation system, the robot control system would include a machine- vision subsystem that would automatically guide the robotic manipulator in choosing the positions from which to cut plugs of plant material.

30|$|A focal full {{thickness}} {{cartilage lesion}} of knee joint {{is one of}} the commonly seen intraarticular pathologies among the joint cartilage problems. The clinical picture can be ranged from knee pain, locking and swelling to severe functional impairment. Moreover, large defects are more likely to cause functional impairment which is especially important in young and physically active individuals and athlete (Bentley and Minas 2000). The treatment of focal cartilage lesion in the knee joint is still a challenging issue (Richter et al. 2015). Lesions > 3  cm 2 have worse results compared to smaller defects (Solheim et al. 2013). The management techniques of full thickness cartilage lesions can be listed as osteochondral autograft transfer (OAT) mosaicplasty, mosaicplasty with synthetic plugs whole tissue transplantation, autologous chondrocyte implantation, cell based scaffold treatment, tissue engineered collagen matrices with autologous chondrocytes and bone marrow stimulation via microfracture (Bedi et al. 2010; Clavé et al. 2016). Among them OAT mosaicplasty is a method which has satisfactory outcomes (Lynch et al. 2015; Hangody et al. 2010; Oztürk et al. 2006). This method is based on the transfer of osteochondral grafts harvested from the non-weight bearing areas of knee to the lesion area. Furthermore, in classical OAT mosaicplasty the autologous osteochondral grafts are <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> of spongious bone covered with hyaline cartilage at one end. The advantages of OAT mosaicplasty are reconstruction of the articular cartilage with high percentages of hyaline cartilage, being a single stage procedure, low risk of disease transmission, and low cost. In spite of the favorable clinical results there are some pitfalls of mosaicplasty treatment especially in cases of large defects. Fibrocartilage filling of the gap spaces between <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs</b> and insufficient donor cartilage reserves are among the disadvantages of classical OAT mosaicplasty.

Deformation {{bands and}} microfractures {{occurring}} in sandstones affect the petrophysical {{properties of the}} rock and determine fluid flow. Deformation bands are quasi-tabular structures, up to 5 mm thick that accommodate offsets {{on the order of}} a few centimeters (Fossen 2010). Such bands show different petrophysical properties in relation to the surrounding rocks and may function as either a path or a barrier to the migrating fluids (Antonellini et al. 1994, Fossen 2010). High porosity rocks show commonly low permeability due to the presence of deformation bands. Recognition of such relationships is important in petroleum geology, particularly for proper reservoir characterization (e. g. Fossen et al. 2007, Ballas et al. 2012, 2013). The aim of the study is to identify and to characterize deformation bands occurring in flysch sandstones of the Outer Carpathians using X-ray nanotomography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Moreover, the impact of sample size on obtained results was also studied. For this study, samples of medium-grained arenites showing catalclastic deformation bands have been collected from the lower Krosno Beds of the Silesian Nappe. Permeability of the studied samples measured along deformation bands and in perpendicular direction varies significantly, being 0. 13 mD and < 0. 001 mD, respectively. Analyses were conducted using X-ray nanotomography Nanotom S General Electric. The recorded data were processed and analyzed using ImageJ and myVGL software. The NMR measurements were carried out on water-saturated samples using the 2 MHz Magritek Rock Core Analyzer and 24 MHz Tomography System. The pore size distribution (PSD) of the rock sample was determined precisely by T 2 CMPG experiments. The spatial estimation of the deformation bands achieved from T 2 spatially resolved measurements. Complementary data regarding to band geometry was registered using three-dimensional Single Point Imaging (SPI) (comp. Zhang & Blümich 2014). Cylindrical plugs 38 mm high and 25 mm in diameter were analysed. The same plugs were used for permeability measurements. The X-ray nanotomography measurements were carried out in three resolutions. The first measurement was carried out with a resolution of 4. 2 microns, but the resultant images were difficult to interpret. Therefore, successive analyses were performed with a resolution of 20 microns covering the entire volume of the samples. After locating microstructures samples were X-rayed again with a resolution of 2. 1 microns. In sections obtained at a resolution of 4. 2 microns, fine structure attributable to deformation band reveals parallel grain orientation and higher density compared with the host sandstone. We observed a slight offset along deformation bands. Three-dimensional image of the sample obtained at a resolution of 20 microns determined the geometry of tectonic microstructures. In one of samples, two structures were recognized. One of them was oriented parallel to the axis of the core, the other was inclined at an angle of about 60 degrees. The thickness of deformation band visible in the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plug</b> was much larger (2 mm) than the thickness of the surface obtained by visualization. This was due to the presence of microfractures, which formed along the deformation band. Measurement with a resolution of 2. 1 microns took an upper base of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plug.</b> Two thin fractures and one relatively thick fracture (approx. 0. 2 mm) were distinguished. This indicates that the deformation band visible {{on the surface of the}} core passes into the microfracture within the sample. It was also confirmed by the visualization with a resolution of 20 microns. Determination of porosity and permeability of the sandstone using the X-ray nanotomograph was impossible due to small pore size that the device is not able to register. However, visualization made with a resolution of 20 microns allowed to clarify the reasons for the different measurements of permeability. Increase of the permeability in the direction parallel to the axis of the core is caused by the presence of open microfractures. The NMR results confirmed possibility to visualize geometry of the bands and their influence for the spatial distribution of porosity. The results show that too large sample sizes make impossible to perform the analysis with high resolution. According to Rodrigues et al. (2015) sample dimensions of 15 × 10 × 10 mm are sufficient to determine the porosity of deformation bands. Published results on three-dimensional micro-tomography of deformation bands concern aeolian sandstones showing high mineralogical and textural maturity (Rodrigues et al. 2015). In contrast, studied flysch sandstones show large diversity of their mineral composition. Therefore, visualization of microtectonic deformation hosted in these sandstones is more difficult to interpret. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

40|$|From 1995 to {{the present}} the {{friction}} stir welding (FSW) process has been under study at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). This is {{an account of the}} progressive emergence of a set of conceptual tools beginning with the discovery of the shear surface, wiping metal transfer, and the invention of a kinematic model and making possible a treatment of both metallurgical structure formation and process dynamics in friction stir welding from a unified point of view. It is generally observed that the bulk of the deformation of weld metal around the FSW pin takes place in a very narrow, almost discontinuous zone with high deformation rates characteristic of metal cutting. By 1999 it was realized that this zone could be treated as a shear surface like that in simple metal cutting models. At the shear surface the seam is drawn out and compressed and pressure and flow conditions determine whether or not a sound weld is produced. The discovery of the shear surface was followed by the synthesis of a simple 3 - flow kinematic model of the FSW process. Relative to the tool the flow components are: (1) an approaching translational flow at weld speed V, (2) a rotating <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plug</b> flow with the angular velocity of the tool, and (3) a relatively slow ring vortex flow (like a smoke ring) encircling the tool and driven by shoulder scrolls and pin threads. The rotating plug flow picks up an element of weld metal, rotates it around with the tool, and deposits it behind the tool (wiping metal transfer); it forms plan section loops in tracers cut through by the tool. Radially inward flow from the ring vortex component retains metal longer in the rotating plug and outward flow expels metal earlier; this interaction forms the looping weld seam trace and the tongue and groove bimetallic weld contour. The radial components of the translational and ring vortex flows introduce parent metal intrusions into the small grained nugget material close to the tool shoulder; if this feature is pronounced, nugget collapse may result. Certain weld features, in particular internal banding seen in transverse section as onion rings and associated surface ridges called tool marks, have long implied an oscillation flow component, but have only recently been attributed in the literature to tool eccentricity. Rotating plug shape, typically a hollow cylinder flared at the end where it sticks to the shoulder, varies as pressure distribution on the tool determines where sticking occurs. Simplified power input estimates balanced against heat loss estimates give reasonable temperature estimates, explain why the power requirement changes hardly at all over a wide range of RPM s, and yield isotherms that seem to fall along boundaries of parameter windows of operation...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the tensile properties of irradiated fuel cladding {{in a hot}} cell, a simple test was developed at ORNL and is described fully in US Patent Application 20060070455, Expanded plug method for developing circumferential mechanical properties of tubular materials. This method is designed for testing fuel rod cladding ductility in a hot cell utilizing an expandable plug to stretch a small ring of irradiated cladding material. The specimen strain is determined using the measured diametrical expansion of the ring. This method removes many complexities associated with specimen preparation and testing. The advantages are the simplicity of measuring the test component assembly in the hot cell and the direct measurement of specimen strain. It was also found that cladding strength could be determined from the test results. The basic approach of this test method is to apply an axial compressive load to a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plug</b> of polyurethane (or other materials) fitted inside a short ring of the test material to achieve radial expansion of the specimen. The diameter increase of the specimen {{is used to calculate}} the circumferential strain accrued during the test. The other two basic measurements are total applied load and amount of plug compression (extension). A simple procedure is used to convert the load circumferential strain data from the ring tests into material pseudo-stress-strain curves. However, several deficiencies exist in this expanded-plug loading ring test, which will impact accuracy of test results and introduce potential shear failure of the specimen due to inherited large axial compressive stress from the expansion plug test. First of all, the highly non-uniform stress and strain distribution resulted in the gage section of the clad. To ensure reliable testing and test repeatability, the potential for highly non-uniform stress distribution or displacement/strain deformation has to be eliminated at the gage section of the specimen. Second, significant compressive stresses were induced by clad bending deformation due to a clad bulging effect (or the barreling effect). The barreling effect caused very large localized shear stress in the clad and left testing material at a high risk of shear failure. The above combined effects will result in highly non-conservative predictions both in strength and ductility of the tested clad, and the associated mechanical properties as well. To overcome/mitigate the mentioned deficiencies associated with the current expansion plug test, systematic studies have been conducted. Through detailed parameter investigation on specific geometry designs, careful filtering of material for the expansion plug, as well as adding newly designed parts to the testing system, a method to reconcile the potential non-conservatism embedded in the expansion plug test system has been discovered. A modified expansion plug testing protocol has been developed based on the method. In order to closely resemble thin-wall theory, a general procedure was also developed to {{determine the}} hoop stress in the tested ring specimen. A scaling factor called -factor is defined to correlate the ring load P into hoop stress., =. The generated stress-strain curve agrees very well with tensile test data in both the elastic and plastic regions...|$|E

Two intermediate players used silver heads with nickel body joints (Yamaha). One expert used a sterling silver flute (Powell), and another expert used a rose gold flute (Brannen-Cooper). Note that only the first nickel body flute had a “split E” mechanism, which facilitates the production of E 6. Every flute used in the experiment was an open-hole flute without any <b>cylindrical</b> acrylic <b>plugs.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} our work {{developing}} the Dual Spacecraft System (DSS). The DSS structure enables {{the launch of}} two independent, small-to-medium class payloads on a single United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas V launch vehicle. The DSS makes extensive use of existing components with well-understood capabilities. The structure itself consists of two back-to-back Centaur Forward Adapters with the optional addition of between one and four stub adapters to provide flexibility in the volumes of {{the upper and lower}} payload envelopes. The Centaur Forward Adapter is a combination of a cylindrical adapter and a conical adapter attached together with a common ring. In the DSS application, the cylindrical halves of the two forward adapters mate together. Besides the simplest solution with no additional plugs, there are several potential configurations available which utilize up to four <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs,</b> the stub adapters. This combination of hardware creates a clamshell which contains the lower payload. The Atlas V 14 foot payload fairing completely encloses the DSS. The DSS encloses the lower payload and provides structural support for the upper payload; the DSS reacts loads only from the upper payload during vehicle flight. The forward interface of the DSS is the 62 inch Standard Interface Specification (SIS) payloa...|$|R
30|$|The {{core plug}} used for {{coreflood}} foam stability tests was commercially available (Kocurek Industries INC., TX, USA). The core {{used in this}} study was “Idaho Gray” sandstone <b>cylindrical</b> outcrop <b>plug</b> of 7.2  cm length and 3.7  cm in diameter. Table  5 lists the physical properties of the core plugs. The high permeability and porosity cores were chosen because of their suitability for foam studies as they are better for foam generation (Mannhardt et al. 2000) and they minimize the capillary end effects which could significantly affect the coreflooding results.|$|R

The method is validated by several numerical simulations of the test involving different friction coefficients between the cell and the specimen. Three 1 D-strain compression tests were performed and processed with the MB 50 high-performance concrete. They showed that the deviatoric and spherical behaviours are almost independent of the strain rate in the observed range of strain rates (80 - 221 s- 1). The deviatoric strength is seen to increase regularly with the hydrostatic pressure.

40|$|Laboratory sanding {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} under true-triaxial stress conditions. The objective {{was to investigate the}} effect of state of stresses and fluid flow on the mechanism of sanding, and the development of the failure zone around the borehole. The {{experiments were}} conducted on 100 × 100 × 100 mm 3 cubic samples of synthetic sandstones. The samples were prepared based on an established procedure developed to produce weakly consolidated sandstone samples with identical physico-mechanical properties. The properties of the synthetic sandstone samples were determined by conducting a series of standard rock mechanics tests on <b>cylindrical</b> <b>plugs.</b> Using a true-triaxial stress cell (TTSC), cubic samples were subjected to true-triaxial stresses and radial fluid flow from the outer boundaries into the borehole. The maximum and intermediate principal stresses were applied laterally in both cases while the effect of changing the lateral stresses {{on the development of the}} failure zone around borehole was monitored. It was observed that the geometry (i. e. width and depth) of the failure zone developed around the borehole is a function of the lateral stresses ratio (i. e. lateral stress anisotropy). The experiments were also simulated numerically using ABAQUS in order to validate and interpret the results from the experiments. A good agreement was obtained between the results of both methods, which confirms the importance of lateral stress anisotropy on the evolution of sanding. The observations and results of these experiments and numerical simulations will be presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionPatellar damage during {{osteochondritis}} dissecans of {{the knee}} is rare. There were two objectives to this study: evaluate the functional results of surgical treatment by mosaicplasty in this disease as well as evaluate articular surface reconstruction and <b>cylindrical</b> bone <b>plugs</b> incorporation. Materials and methodsSix consecutive cases of patella osteochondritis dissecans in young athletes were treated using mosaicplasty by the same senior surgeon between 2002 and 2007. All these cases presented ICRS stage IV osteochondritis dissecans with an empty defect lesion. The average age at diagnosis was 20. 5  ±  9. 2 years old. The pre- and post-operative clinical evaluation {{was based on the}} IKDC subjective knee evaluation, the Lysholm and Tegner scores, CT arthrography and MRI. ResultsEvaluation of the functional results of surgical treatment at a mean follow-up of 26 months showed an average IKDC subjective evaluation score of 66. 3, a Lysholm score of 85 and a Tegner score of 5. 7 (37. 2, 58. 3 and 3. 5 respectively before surgery). The radiological evaluation showed articular surface reconstruction with satisfying congruency and good incorporation of the graft into the bone at the receptor site, except in one patient in whom a 5 mm diameter cartilage defect and a loose body were identified. DiscussionOsteochondral grafting with the mosaicplasty technique {{has been shown to be}} effective and give satisfying functional results. The problem of the per-operative <b>cylindrical</b> bone <b>plugs</b> choice requires to be addressed during the procedure course itself, according to the patella lesion location...|$|R
