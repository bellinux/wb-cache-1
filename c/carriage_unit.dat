40|$|Because of {{the severe}} {{consequences}} arising from Hazardous Material (HazMat) accidents, risk assessment concepts {{have become a}} necessary part {{in the management of}} HazMat logistics, especially for vehicle routing. Optimization is an effective technique and is often used in handling the HazMat logistics routing. This study aims to create a model to prepare a risk-based route network by prioritization technique. The outcome of which can be used in future work on route optimization. This research proposes a method to create an effective logistics network with HazMat-risk concern using the concept of Multiple Criteria Analysis (MCA) by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In the research, gasoline logistics was selected for detailed study as {{it was one of the}} most commonly transported HazMat in Thailand. AHP Structure carried out in this study is based on the judgments and comments of an expert group and local communities. The structure was divided into 3 main components—risk of <b>carriage</b> <b>unit</b> explosion, risk of road accidents and consequences of an incident. Regarding the explosion risk, characteristics of the <b>carriage</b> <b>unit</b> and quantity of HazMat are focused. For investigations of road accidents, contributory factors are considered. Two consequences were included in the study namely, the on-route and off-route population. A mathematical model, formulated by the criteria priority of each factor and its risk level was used for the prioritization. The results show that participants rank the risk of having a road accident as the top priority, followed by the risk of <b>carriage</b> <b>unit</b> explosion and the consequences of an incident (47. 8 %, 27. 4 % and 24. 8 % respectively). To examine this model, data for logistics of gasoline and diesel fuel in Rayong Province (Thailand) were used for the model application. From the calculation, it was possible to reduce the risk of road accidents and the consequences by approximately 6. 8 % and 38. 5 % respectively by choosing the best alternative route instead of the current one...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an optical yarn assessment system for evaluation of twist and structure of twisted yarn. The system comprises a yarn <b>carriage</b> <b>unit,</b> a video microscope and a personal computer. This system was used in conjunction with the well-known tracer fibre technique. This system enables digital images to be grabbed and continuous movies of the yarn to be recorded in order to facilitate the measurement of twist and the analysis of yarn structure. Yarn samples from polyester, viscose and cotton with 35 tex and 485 turns/meter were spun from the roving with 2. 3 % of black fibres on the SKF laboratory ring frame. In order to measure the twist in the rotor yarns with the optical yarn assessment system, a set of yarn samples from same fibres were spun on RU 14 rotor machine with 35 tex and 475 turns/meter. The twist was measured with the optical yarn assessment system and sixty tests of each sample were carried out on the Zweigle D 301. It is clear from the results that there is consistency in the twist of ring-spun yarn measured by the optical yarn assessment system. However, the measured twist with the Zwiegle D 301 is inconsistent in the different yarns. The difference in the mean twist measured with the optical twist measuring system and the double untwist-twist method was not significant at a 5 % probability level when data was analyzed with t test by using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) ...|$|E

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of electric trains in the late 1920s, {{a large number of}} three-car electric multiple units and two-car trailer sets were built. Some were built new by the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company with trailers by the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, but the majority were converted from ex-SECR, LBSC or LSWR carriages. The former LBSC 6.7kV AC electric multiple units were also converted. Post-World War II, many of the three-coach units were reformed as four-car units by the addition of an ex-LSWR 10-compartment <b>carriage.</b> Some <b>units</b> gained a brand new <b>carriage.</b> Other <b>units</b> were formed from various carriages that were part of units that had been damaged by accidents or enemy action.

The London and South Western Railway had successfully operated a railmotor, consisting of a self-contained passenger vehicle with its own steam power unit, on its Southsea Railway, and the Great Western Railway arranged to borrow one unit for trials on its Golden Valley Line in Gloucestershire. The trial proved successful and a steam rail motor was designed by the Chief Mechanical Engineer George Jackson Churchward. Two units were manufactured, and they entered service on the same route on 12 October 1903. A further 44 were built during 1904 and 1905 {{and by the time}} production finished in 1908 the fleet numbered 99 <b>carriage</b> <b>units.</b> There were 112 power units which could be changed between carriages to suit maintenance needs.|$|R
