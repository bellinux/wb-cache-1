50|$|The {{most common}} species in {{cultivation}} is Trachycarpus fortunei (<b>Chusan</b> <b>palm</b> or windmill palm), which is, in cultivated range, the northernmost palm {{species in the}} world. There are several hardy Trachycarpus species that stay outdoors all year long with little to no protection at the New York Botanical Garden. The dwarf form popularly known as T. wagnerianus is unknown in the wild, and is now considered synonymous with T. fortunei. It resembles that species closely, differing only in its smaller and stiffer leaves. Hybrids between them are intermediate in size and fully fertile.|$|E
