40|$|Sensitization to <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> {{requires}} {{activation of}} the innate immune system by endogenous danger signals. However, the mechanisms through which <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> activate innate signaling pathways are incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate that mice lacking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) receptor P 2 X 7 are resistant to contact hypersensitivity (CHS). P 2 X 7 -deficient dendritic cells fail to induce sensitization to <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> and do not release IL- 1 β in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP. These defects are restored by pretreatment with LPS and alum in an NLRP 3 - and ASC-dependent manner. Whereas pretreatment of wild-type mice with P 2 X 7 antagonists, the ATP-degrading enzyme apyrase or IL- 1 receptor antagonist, prevents CHS, IL- 1 β injection restores CHS in P 2 X 7 -deficient mice. Thus, P 2 X 7 is a crucial receptor for extracellular ATP released in skin in response to <b>contact</b> <b>allergens.</b> The lack of P 2 X 7 triggering prevents IL- 1 β release, which is an essential step in the sensitization process.

These findings, then, imply the existence of regulatory suppressor cells for T-cell phenomena in the hamster.

40|$|Epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) and cytokines play a {{critical}} role in the initiation phase of contact hypersensitivity reactions in the skin. Most of the studies of these aspects have been performed in animal models and relatively little is known about the human system. Short-term human skin organ cultures, in which LC preserved their characteristics and distribution within the epidermis, were used to examine the time course effects of <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> on human LC in situ and whether these effects are mediated by cytokines. Epicutaneous application of nontoxic concentrations of <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene, 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene, and nickel sulphate, but not the irritants sodium dodecylsuphaye and croton oil or the tolerogen 2, 4 -dichloronitrobenzene, significantly reduced the total number of LC in the epidermis: remaining LC were localized along the epidermal-dermal junction, suggesting a migration of LC within and out of the epidermis. LC that are migrated to the epidermal-dermal junction showed a decreased expression of CD 1 a+ and MHC-II and an upregulation of ICAM-I. While these effects were observed after 24 hours, the expression of IL- 1 beta protein was induced exclusively by LC as early as 4 hours after skin challenge with <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> alone. After 24 hours, <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> not only increased the expression of IL- 1 beta but also induced the expression of IL- 1 alpha, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, and IL- 6 proteins mainly by suprabasal keratinocytes. In an attempt to study the possible relation between allergen-induced epidermal cytokines and the migration and phenotypic changes of LC, skin explants were incubated with corresponding human recombinant (hr) cytokines. After 12 hours, hr IL- 1 beta, but not other hr cytokines (IL- 1 alpha, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF, and IL- 6), induced the migration within and out of the epidermis and decreased the expression of CD 1 a+ and MHC-II on remaining epidermal LC similar to that caused by <b>contact</b> <b>allergens.</b> Pre-incubation of skin explants with neutralizing IL- 1 beta antibodies, but not antibodies to IL- 1 alpha, TNF-alpha, or GM-CSF, significantly prevented the allergen-induced migration of LC. This study showed that <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> preferentially induced the migration of LC within and out of the epidermis and modulated the expression of cell surface molecules on migrated LC as well as induced the early expression of LC-derived IL- 1 beta.

40|$|Contact allergy (delayed hypersensitivity) {{may develop}} {{as a result}} of skin {{exposure}} to <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> (haptens) and can lead to allergic contact dermatitis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate some predictive animal test methods for <b>contact</b> <b>allergens.</b> It was done with the aim that the test methods giving the clinically most relevant results should be used in risk assessment of chemicals and in research. A slightly modified multi-dose-response induction protocol was evaluated with two model <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> when applied to three guinea pig predictive test methods. The protocol was easily applied to the cumulative contact enhancement test (CCET) and the Freund's complete adjuvant test (FCAT), which have only one induction route. However, for the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT) with two induction routes, the topical doses at induction interacted with the logistic model. The protocol would benefit from further development and some modifications are suggested. Calculations of the estimated concentration sensitizing 50 % of the animals (EC 50) improves the possibility for proper ranking of <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> and augments the information used in risk assessment. The calculated EC 50 -values for the model allergens were: 0. 00045 % in the FCAT, 0. 0025 % in the GPMT and 0. 0042 % in the CCET for potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr 2 O 7), and 0. 068 % in the GPMT, 0. 89 % in the FCAT and 1. 8 % in the CCET for hydroxycitronellal (HC). A multi-dose-response induction protocol was applied on a modified mouse ear swelling test (MEST) and evaluated with four <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> and one irritant. This protocol could detect the moderate to strong <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> as sensitizers, but not one (HC) of the two weak <b>contact</b> <b>allergens.</b> The irritant (negative control) gave a Ônegative' response. The EC 50 -values calculated for the three detected allergens were 0. 002 % for oxazolone, 0. 03 % for K 2 Cr 2 O 7 and 0. 7 % for methyldibromo glutaronitrile (MDBGN). The murine local lymph node assay (LLNA) is a predictive test method, but its ability to discriminate between allergens and irritants has been questioned. Eight <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> and six irritants were investigated in the evaluation of the LLNA. The moderate to strong allergens gave clearly Ôpositive' results (stimulation index (SI) = 12. 8 - 39. 9), but one weak allergen (benzocaine) was not classified as a sensitizer (SI< 3). The irritants tested, i. e. chloroform/methanol, methylsalicylate, nonanoic acid, oxalic acid, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Triton X- 100, however, gave also Ôpositive' results (SI = 5. 0 - 10. 7), not distinguishable from the results with weak and moderate <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> (SI = 3. 4 - 17. 1). The addition of 10 % SDS could not be used to reduce the induced proliferation due to irritation from the test chemicals, nor could an alternative choice of vehicle. The allergenicity of a preservative, i. e. Euxyl K 400, and one of its ingredients, MDBGN, was investigated in three different animal predictive test methods, and patch testing in dermatitis patients was performed for comparison. The CCET using 57 a multi-dose-response induction protocol (EC 50 = 1. 9 % for MDBGN) and the LLNA (SI = 7. 4 - 7. 9 for MDBGN and 8. 4 - 12. 0 for Euxyl K 400) confirmed the sensitization potential of the substance based on dermatitis patients patch test results (total frequency varied between 0. 9 - 1. 8 %). However, the results from the GPMT were not statistically significant. In conclusion, even though the LLNA and the MEST have some advantages compared to the guinea pig test methods concerning speed, labor-intensiveness and cost, and the use of an objective end point, the methods are at present not capable of replacing the predictive guinea pig test methods. Both the LLNA and MEST gave a lower sensitization rate with the weak and moderate <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> tested than the guinea pig test methods did. The MEST is judged to be less capable of detecting potential <b>contact</b> <b>allergens</b> than the LLNA, but on the other hand no false Ôpositive' reactivity with the irritant tested was seen. Dose-response designs of predictive test methods increase the amount of information obtained from each sensitization study and should be considered for inclusion in the protocols used when the sensitizing potential of a substance is investigated. Investigators are advised to select the predictive test method with the induction procedure that is most relevant for the prospected use of the substance being tested. A test method with a particular induction route may be more suitable for testing a substance than one of the recommended methods, so there is also a possibility to use other available standardized predictive animal test methods. However, that predictive test methods have a varying capacity to detect the sensitizing potential of a substance is evident...|$|R

The NCTC 2544 cell line was exposed to three <b>contact</b> <b>allergens,</b> namely p-phenylenediamine (PPD), 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), and citral, in the presence or absence of diphenylene iodonium (DPI), allopurinol, and rotenone to identify the source of ROS, and to anti-Toll-like receptor 4 antibody and glycirrizic acid to characterize the danger-associated molecular pattern molecules. In the case of PPD, the induction of IL- 18 can be modulated by rotenone, allopurinol, and DPI. In the case of DNCB, rotenone completely prevents the induction of IL- 18, whereas for citral, DPI completely prevents the induction of IL- 18. We demonstrated the ability of all allergens tested to induce the release of high-mobility group protein B 1 (HMGB 1).

The lack of human data on respiratory allergenic potential of OXA may be due to lack of significant inhalation exposure. Here, female Brown Norway rats (BN) were sensitized by two or five dermal applications of OXA at the same total dose of 3. 75 mg. Controls received vehicle. All animals were challenged by inhalation to 45 mg/m 3 OXA on day 21 and necropsy was performed on day 22. All sensitized animals had increased serum IgE. OXA challenge decreased breathing frequency, and induced apnoeic breathing in the sensitized animals - a hallmark of respiratory allergy in our model. An exudative, granulocytic inflammation was observed primarily in the larynx of the sensitized and challenged rats.
