5|$|On October 10, Samutsevich's new lawyer, Irina Khrunova, {{argued that}} her <b>client</b> <b>had</b> {{not in fact}} {{committed}} the acts of hooliganism in the church as she was prevented from accessing the soleas by church security. The court appeared to accept this argument, and released Samutsevich on two years' probation. However, the judges rejected the appeals of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, upholding their convictions and sentences.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} his release, Van der Sloot gave several interviews that explained {{his version of}} events. The most notable discussion included a lengthy interview with Fox News that aired over three nights in March 2006. During the interview, Van der Sloot indicated that Holloway wanted {{to have sex with}} him, but he did not because he didn't have a condom. Van der Sloot stated that Holloway wanted them to stay on the beach, but that {{he had to go to}} school in the morning. According to Van der Sloot, he was picked up by Satish Kalpoe at about 3:00am and left Holloway sitting on the beach. In August 2005, David Kock, Satish Kalpoe's attorney, stated that his <b>client</b> <b>had</b> gone to sleep, and had not returned to drive Van der Sloot home. Van der Sloot stated that he was somewhat ashamed to have left a young woman alone on the beach, albeit by her own request, and related that he was not truthful at first because he was convinced that Holloway would soon turn up.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, {{the defense}} {{asked for the}} new trial to be moved outside Brownsville, {{claiming}} their <b>client</b> <b>had</b> received unfair treatment {{in the media and}} there was no chance for her to have a fair trial and an unbiased jury. The request included large numbers of magazines and newspaper articles published since 1993. It did not cite any specific passages where the alleged media bias was demonstrated. The defense also filed a motion to throw out the new indictment {{on the grounds that it}} was double jeopardy. On April 27, the judge decided to postpone his decision about where to hold the trial. He also rejected the defense motion stating that the new indictment was a case of double jeopardy. The defense argued that the prosecution had illegally used Brownsville and Houston grand juries to work on the case, but the judge countered that claim saying only the Houston grand jury had handled the case. On May 4, the trial was moved from Brownsville to Houston, Texas, because of the earlier extensive media coverage.|$|E

5|$|The team {{developing}} the Linux <b>client</b> <b>had</b> {{been working for}} {{a year before the}} announcement to validate that such a port would be possible. As of the official announcement, a near-feature-complete Steam client for Linux had been developed and successfully run on Ubuntu. Internal beta testing of the Linux client started in October 2012; external beta testing occurred in early November the same year. Open beta clients for Linux were made available in late December 2012, and the client was officially released in mid-February 2013. At the time of announcement, Valve's Linux division assured that its first game on the OS, Left 4 Dead 2, wpuld run at an acceptable frame rate and with a degree of connectivity with the Windows and OS X versions. From there, it began working on porting other games to Ubuntu and expanding to other Linux distributions. Linux games are also eligible for SteamPlay availability. Versions of Steam working under Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux were released by October 2013. By June 2014, the number of Linux-compatible games on Steam had reached over 500, surpassing over 1,000 by March 2015. A year later, this number doubled to over 2,000.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} guilty, {{as had been}} expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her <b>client</b> <b>had</b> planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.|$|E

McKim still questioned the legitimacy of insurance payments and said he had done nothing wrong, but another of Kazeminy's attorneys said his <b>client</b> <b>had</b> not ruled out future litigation against McKim.|$|E
25|$|Savile was a {{volunteer}} at the adult high-security psychiatric Broadmoor Hospital, and in August 1988 {{was appointed to}} chair an interim task force overseeing {{the management of the}} hospital, after its management board had been suspended. It is alleged that Savile had hospital keys and access to patients' rooms. In a separate allegation, a lawyer said a <b>client</b> <b>had</b> been abused by Savile when he was a 10-year-old at the Haut de la Garenne children's home in Jersey.|$|E
25|$|Bustamante was a well-behaved {{teenager}} who suddenly {{at the age}} of 22 became a career criminal. His crimes included theft, breaking and entering, drug offenses, and robbery. In 1990 Bustamante was charged with a homicide. The defense team discovered that the <b>client</b> <b>had</b> suffered a head injury from a crowbar {{at the age of}} twenty. Bustamante’s behavior changed fundamentally after that, transforming him from a normal individual into an impulsive and emotionally labile criminal. The defense team had his client’s brain scanned, which revealed malfunctioning of the prefrontal cortex. At the end the jury believed that Bustamante’s brain was not normal and spared him from the death penalty.|$|E

25|$|Five {{months after}} Nodder had been {{formally}} {{charged with the}} murder of Mona Tinsley, he appeared at Nottingham Assizes to be tried for her murder. His second trial began on 22 November 1937, and again saw Norman Birkett appear on behalf of the prosecution, and Maurice Healy on behalf of the defence. Healy again argued his <b>client</b> <b>had</b> no motive to commit the murder. Nodder himself testified at this second trial, claiming that he had not seen Mona after he had placed her on a bus at Worksop, with view to her visiting her aunt in Sheffield. In response to questioning from both the prosecution and defence, Nodder denied killing the child, and alleged she had been murdered by an unknown individual after he had last seen her.|$|E
25|$|The {{duty of care}} owed by {{trustees}} and fiduciaries has its partner in the common law of negligence, and was also long recognised by courts of equity. Millett LJ, however, in Bristol and West Building Society v Mothew emphasised that although recognised in equity, and applicable to fiduciaries, the duty of care is not itself a fiduciary duty, like the rule against conflicts of interest. This means that like ordinary negligence actions, the common law requirements for proving causation of loss apply, and the remedy for breach of duty is of compensation for losses rather than restitution of gains. In Mothew this meant that a solicitor (who occupies a fiduciary position, like a trustee) who negligently told a building society that its <b>client</b> <b>had</b> no second mortgage was not liable for the loss in the property's value after the client defaulted. Mr Mothew successfully argued that Bristol & West would have granted the loan in any case, and so his advice did not cause their loss.|$|E
25|$|Several {{incidents}} {{have occurred}} in the past involving the base. In 1999, two drunken soldiers, Denis Popov and Alexander Kamenev, armed with AK-74 assault rifles, went into Gyumri and started a gunfire, killing two men, Vaghinak Simonyan and David Soghomonyan, and injuring 14. The two men were tried in Armenia; Popov was sentenced to 14 years in prison and Kamenev to 15. Whether or not the two served their entire terms in Armenia is unclear and little is known about this court’s investigation and punishment. In an interview published on January 16 with News.am, Popov’s lawyer, Tamara Yailoyan, claimed that her former <b>client</b> <b>had</b> been transferred to Russia “after two to three years,” and, “we later learned, set free.” In 2013, two children were killed by a mine on the training field {{in the vicinity of the}} military base. The field was not fenced or given properly warning, but nonetheless the command of the military based never punished anyone and also ignored the official complaints of the locals.|$|E

500|$|Brian McKnight's manager {{stated that}} his <b>client</b> <b>had</b> already {{recorded}} tracks with the singer, while rapper Nelly {{explained to the}} reporters that both him and Timberlake had discussed a collaboration effort. Early in 2002, Angie Stone revealed that Timberlake [...] "loves the Mahogany Soul album" [...] with him further saying to her [...] "your CD's in my car right now, {{you have to work}} on my solo project". These assertions were later partially denied by a Jive spokesperson who announced that the material produced from the collaboration would not appear on the finalized record.|$|E
500|$|Lim {{particularly}} preyed on gullible {{girls who}} had deep personal problems. [...] He promised them that he could solve their woes and increase their beauty through a ritual massage.

[...] Lim's treatments also included an electro-shock therapy based on that used on mental patients. [...] After placing his client's feet in a tub of water and attaching wires to her temples, Lim passed electricity through her. [...] The shocks, he assured her, would cure headaches and drive away evil spirits.|$|E
500|$|He {{ruled that}} it was unconstitutional to require that a jury be {{unanimous}} in its finding of circumstances mitigating against determining a sentence of death. Eliot Grossman and Marlene Kamish, attorneys for Abu-Jamal, criticized the ruling {{on the grounds that}} it denied the possibility of a trial de novo, at which they could introduce evidence that their <b>client</b> <b>had</b> been framed. Prosecutors also criticized the ruling; Officer Faulkner's widow Maureen described Abu-Jamal as a [...] "remorseless, hate-filled killer" [...] who would [...] "be permitted to enjoy the pleasures that come from simply being alive" [...] on the basis of the judgment. Both parties appealed.|$|E

500|$|Conley's former attorney, William Smith, {{had become}} {{convinced}} that his <b>client</b> <b>had</b> committed the murder. Smith produced a 100-page {{analysis of the}} notes for the defense. He analyzed [...] "speech and writing patterns" [...] and [...] "spelling, grammar, repetition of adjectives, [...] favorite verb forms". He concluded, [...] "In this article I show clearly that Conley {{did not tell the}} truth about those notes." [...] Slaton compared the murder notes, Conley's letters to Annie Maude Carter, and his trial testimony. Throughout these documents, he found similar use of the words [...] "like", [...] "play", [...] "lay", [...] "love", and [...] "hisself". He also found double adjectives such as [...] "long tall negro", [...] "tall, slim build heavy man", and [...] "good long wide piece of cord in his hands".|$|E
500|$|At {{subsequent}} hearings, {{each side}} submitted replications (affidavits) with {{his version of}} the evidence. Ashford sought for the Court to rule that the evidence against Thornton was strong and that the defendant was thus ineligible to wage battle; Thornton sought the opposite. Much of the case was argued between 6 and 8 February 1818, but one of Ashford's counsel, Joseph Chitty, asked for and received more time so he could reply to the other side's arguments, and the matter was adjourned until 16 April. Chitty then responded but was so often interrupted in his argument by the judges that when he sat down, according to Sir John Hall in his book on the affair, [...] "it was clear to everyone in Court that his <b>client</b> <b>had</b> lost his case".|$|E
500|$|Around {{the same}} time, perhaps in 287, Persia relinquished claims on Armenia and {{recognized}} Roman authority over territory {{to the west}} and south of the Tigris. The western portion of Armenia was incorporated into the empire and made a province. Tiridates III, Arsacid claimant to the Armenian throne and Roman <b>client,</b> <b>had</b> been disinherited and forced to take refuge in the empire after the Persian conquest of 252–53. In 287, he returned to lay claim to the eastern half of his ancestral domain and encountered no opposition. Bahram II's gifts were widely recognized as symbolic of a victory in the ongoing conflict with Persia, and Diocletian was hailed as the [...] "founder of eternal peace". The events might have represented a formal end to Carus' eastern campaign, which probably ended without an acknowledged peace. At the conclusion of discussions with the Persians, Diocletian re-organized the Mesopotamian frontier and fortified the city of Circesium (Buseire, Syria) on the Euphrates.|$|E
