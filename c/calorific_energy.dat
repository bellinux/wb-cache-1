And that power of seeing, and the other various personalities and authorities of the animal body, in pleasure and pain, have never, hitherto, been, I do not say, explained, but in any wise touched or approached by scientific discovery. Some of the conditions of mere external animal form and of muscular vitality have been shown; {{but for the most part}} that is true, even of external form, which I wrote six years ago.

A viable alternative aviation fuel can stabilize fuel price fluctuation and reduce the reliance from the crude oil. Due to the high growth rate of aviation sector, supply security of fuel, and environmental impact of fuel has caused the aviation industry to investigate the potential use of alternative fuels [8]. Presently, it appears that a blend of kerosene and synthetic fuel will be possible for use in existing and near-term aircraft [7]. While, future mid-term aircraft may use a blend of bio-fuels and synthetic fuels in ultra-efficient airplane designs, and future long term engines and aircraft in the 50 -plus year horizon may be specifically designed to use alternative fuels with low to zero carbon content, such as liquid hydrogen or liquid methane [82]. Hence, based on past studies, we tried to balance several factors when selecting AFP measures. The AFP parameters including fuel availability, net <b>calorific</b> value, <b>energy</b> density, aromatic content, carbon content, thermal stability, and flash point [7, 8, 33, 41, 73, 74] were shown to influence fuel efficiency, and hence were incorporated in the current study.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: - Solid biomass {{continues}} to be the primary energy source for a significant proportion of Sub-Saharan African society. It is estimated that 80 % of energy for heating and cooking in this subcontinent is derived from round wood biomass resulting in estimated annual rate of deforestation of 0. 7 %. This is unsustainable. This is despite the existence of a substantial resource of loose biomass (forest and agricultural residues) that is produced and disposed of annually. However, one major challenge in harnessing loose biomass as a source of energy is low energy density and poor combustion behaviour. Biomass briquetting technologies can be deployed to improve energy density and combustion behaviour of loose biomass. This requires understanding of the energy content in locally available loose biomass sources. This paper investigates the <b>calorific</b> values (<b>energy</b> content) and combustion behaviour of loose biomass collected from a region in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. The aim of the investigation is to understand the energy value and hence viability of using such loose biomass with the overall goal of developing recipes for biomass briquetting in the region. Calorific values were measured for 12 samples of loose biomass and their combustion behaviour analysed. Certain loose biomass sources are then identified as potential briquetting candidates...|$|R

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis under the title "Thermal models for fire safety – calculation of flame spread on surfaces and heating of structures" consist of two parts: flame spread on combustible surfaces and calculation of heating of structures. This work consists {{of the development of}} thermal models for Fire Safety purposes. The main objective of the present thesis work is to produce new information for fire safety related to the development of models for flame spread on surfaces and to develop engineering calculation methods in heating of structures. In the context of Fire Safety, the word "fire" means accidental unwanted fires. The primary goal in Fire Safety is to protect life and property. The research field is relatively young and multi-disciplinary. The growth rate of a fire depends on how fast the flame will spread and involve more burning surfaces. In an enclosure, the burning rate is enhanced due to feedback effects but it is still the increasing area of the fire that affect the flame size. In fully developed fire, as in enclosures, the availablilty of air limits the rate of heat release. Fire growth rate and the rate of heat release depend highly on how rapidly the initialized fire propagates on surfaces. Thus, it is the flame spread that controls the rate of heat release in large or open spaces. This shows the importance of modeling flame spread, due to its direct impact on fire safety. This first part of the work discusses upward surface flame spread on a combustible solid surface. The flame spread is a process of a moving flame in the vicinity of a pyrolysing region on the surface which acts as a fuel source. The flame itself results from the combustion in the atmosphere of the pyrolysed gases leaving the surface. The oxygen and fuel concentrations together with the heat transfer phenomena between the flame and the solid phase affect strongly the process. Flame spread models of various levels of complexity are developed. A novel thermal pyrolysis upward flame spread model is also developed to predict the fire growth of combustible charring wall linings. Heat release rate in fires is of primary importance. When a structure is present, a part of the <b>calorific</b> <b>energy</b> dissipated in the fire is fed back to the structure via thermal radiation and convection with consequence of raising its temperature. As the performance of structures decrease with the increasing of temperature, knowledge of temperature distribution within the structure it is important to estimate the safe-escape time for occupants, safe-operational time for firemen and fire resistance. It is therefore essential to model heat transfer in structures. In {{the second part of the}} thesis heating of structures and temperature calculations in solids are addressed. Efficient engineering temperature calculation algorithms for various fire heated structures are developed. reviewe...|$|E

Fuel: A major source of firewood, its dense wood and high <b>energy</b> (<b>calorific</b> value of 4500-4900 kcal/kg) contribute to its popularity. It provides very good charcoal that glows well with little smoke and does not spark. Fibre: The wood is extensively used for paper pulp. Plantation-grown trees have been found promising for the production of unbleached kraft pulp and high-quality, neutral, sulphite semi-chemical pulp. Large-scale plantations have already been established, as in Kerala, India, for the production of pulp. Timber: The sapwood is yellow; the heartwood light brown to dark red, straight grained and reasonably durable. The wood has a high basic density (500-650 kg/m³), is fine-grained, often attractively figured and finishes well. It is excellent for turnery articles, toys, carom coins, chessmen and handicrafts. Also used for furniture, joinery, tool handles, and for construction if trees of suitable girth are available. Tannin or dyestuff: The bark contains sufficient tannin (13-25%) for commercial exploitation and contains 6-14% of a natural dye suitable for the soga-batik industry. In India, the bark is collected locally for use as tanning material. A natural dye, used in the batik textile industry in Indonesia, is also extracted from the bark. Other products: An edible mushroom, Tylopylus fellus, is common in plantations of A. auriculiformis in Thailand.|$|R

Kemiri nut meg can be used not only as food-seasoning, ingredients {{but also as a}} traditional medicine. The kernel portion of kemiri nut has high nutrition and <b>energy</b> (<b>calorific)</b> values, and so does its oil. The nut, is the meat part after removing the kemiri thell, could is further produced oil after having undergone certains extractions process. Kemiri nut oil has such specific characteristics that being easily dried under open air. Therefore, this oil can be used as volatilizing agent in the manufactures of paint and varnish. In addition, the properties of kemiri nut oil are affected by its extraction methods and quality of its raw material (kemiri nut). In this regard, the study is conducted to learn the effect of cooking duration on the yield and physico-chemical propertiesof the resulting oil. The aim {{of this study is to}} find out the optimal cooking duration capable of producing oil with satisfactory qualities. The results reveal that increase in the cooking duration are affected significantly the yield, specific gravity, light transmittion, free fatty acid (FFA) content, and iod number of the oil. Cooking duration for 30 minutes turned out to give optimum condition with respect to oil properties, i. e. yield at 49, 94 %, iod number = 158. 657; FFA = 1. 1399; specific gravity = 0. 9211, and transmittion = 70. 43...|$|R
40|$|Furniture {{waste is}} mainly {{composed}} {{of wood and}} upholstery foam (mostly polyurethane foam). Both of these have a high <b>calorific</b> value, therefore, <b>energy</b> recovery would be an appropriate process to manage these wastes. Nevertheless, the drawback is that the energy content of these wastes is limited due to their low density mainly that of upholstery foam. Densification of separate foam presents difficulties due to its elastic character. The significance of this work lies in obtaining densified material by co-densification of furniture wood waste and polyurethane foam waste. Densification of furniture wood and the co-densification of furniture wood waste with polyurethane foam have been studied. On the one hand, the parameters that {{have an effect on}} the quality of the furniture waste briquettes have been analysed, i. e., moisture content, compaction pressure, presence of lignin, etc. The maximum weight percentage of polyurethane foam that can be added with furniture wood waste to obtain durable briquettes and the optimal moisture were determined. On the other hand, some parameters were analysed in order to evaluate the possible effect on the combustion. The chemical composition of waste wood was compared with untreated wood biomass; the higher nitrogen content and the concentration of some metals were the most important differences, with a significant difference of Ti content.

40|$|SSAB’s two {{integrated}} {{iron and}} steel production plants in Luleå and Oxelösund are among the largest point sources of greenhouse gases in Sweden. Their reported emissions included in Sweden’s annual submission to the UNFCCC have been reviewed and revised in several previous studies. In a 2010 SMED pilot study it was concluded that there was a need to further review the energy allocation model for the Luleå and Oxelösund plants as well as the reported energy consumption and CO 2 emissions from excess energy gases utilized outside the SSAB premises for power and heat production. In the light of the pilot study, this study aimed at de-veloping a robust and sustainable model for present reported time-series for future estimations. In cooperation with SSAB representatives, information on annual material input, <b>calorific</b> values and <b>energy</b> flows were assessed and used as basis for estimation of total energy consumption and model for energy allocation. In addition, energy statistics from Statistics Sweden and EU ETS data were evaluated. The results show that the present estimations of energy consumption in the IPCC energy sector based on data from the plant-specific annual environmental reports and energy statistics from Statistics Sweden are sufficient also for future reporting to the UNFCCC. Furthermore, this report includes recommendations on revisions and future reporting of CO 2 emissions from combustion of SSAB excess energy gases (reported in CRF 1 A 1 a) as well as of energy allocated to non-energy use of fuels in industrial processes (CRF 2 C 1) and feedstocks (CRF 1 Ad) ...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the study}} {{presented}} here {{the use of}} energy recovery from waste was analysed for several industrial facilities, focussing on cement plants, kilns in the lime and gypsum industry, steel works and plants {{for the production of}} non ferrous metals. 44 German cement plants dispose of an own clinker production. Presently 31 plants have a permit for recovering energy from waste. The total permitted capacity for energy recovery in German cement kilns amounts to nearly 2, 6 Mio. t/a. Mainly waste oil, old tyres, fuel derived from processed production-specific and municipal waste, plastics, scrap wood and waste paper are co-incinerated. In 1998 / 99 a total amount of roughly 945. 000 t refuse was processed in 30 units of the studied facilities. In five furnaces at three steel works waste can be used for energy or material recovery. The approved total capacity of high <b>calorific</b> waste for <b>energy</b> recovery comes to nearly 350, 000 t/a. Especially industrial plastics and packaging waste from DSD, plastics processed in scrap mills and shreddered waste and granulated paint sludge are used. In 1998 the facilities processed only old plastic, representing a total amount of nearly 109. 000 t. At present seven facilities in the non ferrous metal industry have a permit for energy recovery from waste. The maximum capacity amounts on national level to nearly 140. 000 t/a. Especially waste oil, packaging waste, plastics and scrap wood can be processed. The analysis of respective applications of the 17 th BImSchV shows an inconsistency within the amending permitting procedures. For the time to come a conformity between the respective regional permitting authorities would be recommendable. Moreover, the effects on air emission caused by using waste for energy recovery were analysed for cement kilns with own clinker production. Due to the amendment of the 17 th BImSchV more stringent requirements regarding waste composition must be established. This is especially valid for the highly volatile mercury. For this heavy metal suitable input limitations need to be fixed. (orig.)

40|$|There is {{emerging}} literature demonstrating that restricting dietary carbohydrate (CHO) intake might upregulate cellular markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondria quantity and density {{has been linked}} with increased endurance performance, reduction in type 2 diabetes and improved insulin sensitivity. A number of transcriptional cellular markers {{have been identified as}} key regulators of this process. PURPOSE: To determine the influence of 7 days dietary manipulation on resting metabolic rate (RMR), body composition and transcriptional markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. METHOD: Forty-six healthy male participants (mean ± SD; age (years), body mass (kg), height (cm); 28 ± 5, 75. 6 ± 11. 1, 178. 0 ± 4. 9, respectively) were recruited and randomised to one of four conditions: energy matched high protein (PRO-EM), energy restricted high protein (PRO-ER), energy matched high carbohydrate (CHO-EM) or energy restricted high carbohydrate (CHO-ER). Macronutrient ratios (PRO:CHO:FAT) of 40 : 30 : 30 and 60 : 10 : 30 were used for high protein and high carbohydrate conditions, respectively. <b>Calorific</b> intake for <b>energy</b> restricted groups was matched to RMR. Participants visited the laboratory on 3 occasions across 15 days. On days 0, 7 and 15 participants completed assessments of body composition (DEXA) and RMR (indirect calorimetry), prior to providing a muscle biopsy from the vastus lateralis for later analysis of transcriptional markers via real-time polymerase chain reaction. Between days 1 & 7 and 7 & 14 participants consumed their habitual and prescribed diets, respectively. Laboratory testing was completed following an overnight fast {{and at the same time}} of day on each occasion. RESULTS: No difference in RMR was observed in any group across all time points. AMPK, PGC- 1 a, SIRT 1 and PPAR expression was increased in the PRO-ER group (1. 32, 1. 20, 1. 45 and 1. 41 fold, respectively). Transcriptional markers were not affected in either CHO group. The CHO-ER group demonstrated a greater loss in lean mass relative to the PRO-EM (- 2. 22 vs - 0. 35 %,) and body mass loss relative to both CHO-EM and PRO-EM (- 2. 85 vs - 0. 95 vs - 1. 47 %) (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: A restriction energy intake combined with increased protein consumption for 7 days increases transcriptional markers of mitochondrial biogenesis...|$|R
