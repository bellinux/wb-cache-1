5000|$|Today, Iguana Yachts {{production}} {{is made up}} of 29 ft boats, equipped with 300 HP outboard motors [...] They can reach 35 knots on sea and 7 km/h on earth. The Iguana Yachts amphibious boats carry many innovations, with more than 800 parts, from the customized high resistance roller blade suspensions to the automatized <b>control</b> <b>command</b> <b>system.</b> The ground engine, key of the terrestrial propulsion system has been developed with major German engineers and carry marine grade aluminum and 316 stainless steel, materials adapted for an extensive marine immersion resistant to corrosion. The hulls are built from composite materials using advanced resin infusion technologies: vacuum infusion, foam core sandwich and carbon fiber, guaranteeing the best possible balance between strength and weight. Vacuum pressure is used to drive resin into the laminate. The aluminum landing gear connected to the carbon fiber hull ensures fatigue resistance and leads to the good performance of the boats. The Iguana 29 are used as tender yachts, as day boats for owners of beach villas enabling them to go directly from the garden to the water. The last fundraising (end of 2013), brought 1.2 million Euros from several private investors to ensure the further development of the Plan.|$|E
40|$|Traditional <b>control</b> <b>command</b> <b>system</b> {{relies on}} input {{devices such as}} a remote {{controller}} to input commands to a system. However, such command system is single-user only, not intuitive, and requires an additional input device. In contrast, this work presents a <b>control</b> <b>command</b> <b>system</b> which merely relies on hand motions. The system consists of two inexpensive commodity cameras and a desktop computer. The acquired images are processed using foreground human user hand extraction, command cube detection and activation, depth filtering, and command recognition. The proposed command cube limits the computation complexity while the depth filtering increases the system robustness. The presented <b>control</b> <b>command</b> <b>system</b> can successfully achieve control command processing at a frame rate of 5 fps even with other people moving in the scene. 1...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Safety {{is seen as}} a must, for railway {{transport}} market. However it is not so obvious what does safety exactly mean as it means different things for different experts. Showing safety ensured by control command systems as a component of the railway operational safety and pointing associated challenges especially those arising from subdivision of the national railway system into different entities. Methodology. To achieve this purpose control command and signalling systems keeping safe distances between trains, preventing setting conflicting train routs, locking of the mobile elements of the switches, protecting the level crossings, enabling safe incorporation of additional trains were analyzed. Findings. Article analyses how <b>control</b> <b>command</b> <b>system</b> influence operational safety taking into account safety of the control-command system itself, interfaces on one side between signalling systems and <b>control</b> <b>command</b> <b>system</b> {{and on the other side}} between <b>control</b> <b>command</b> <b>system</b> and vehicle control systems, transmission, maintenance, and operation in degraded modes of running. Originality. New and high-effective scope of tests which are necessary for putting new control command installation into service both track-side and on-board are proposed. Practical value. Control command implementations will significantly improve operational safety, however it is possible only when recommendations defined in this article are taken into account. This means that all the components including interfaces have to meet acceptable hazard rate 10 E- 9 and have to be properly design, constructed, assembled and maintained, all taking into account whole chain of functions performed and supervised by different railway entities...|$|E

40|$|Dept. Accelerateurs - PHILInternational audiencePHIL [1] is an {{electron}} beam accelerator at LAL. It produces low energy (E< 5 MeV) and high current (maximum 2 nC/bunch, 10 ps duration) electron bunch at a repetition frequency of 5 Hz. The beam charge measurements are performed by two Faraday Cups (FC) {{at both ends}} of the beam line and also with two Integrating Current Transformer (ICT), installed immediately after the RF gun and at the end of the straight beam line (see figure 1). Extracted signals from the ICT and FC, are processed by electronic circuits, displayed on an oscilloscope, and used to calculate the beam charge manually using the oscilloscope features. This operation is not accurate, does't permit to follow and save the temporal evolution of the charge and cannot be integrated in the <b>control</b> <b>command</b> <b>system.</b> To overcome this problem, a new approach was adopted, based on two systems:An electronic back-end to integrate the signal from coming the charge measurement systems (20 ns large pulse), and outputs a large duration signal (around 400 mu s) whose amplitude is proportional to the beam charge. A microcontroller is used to acquire the integrated signal with a repetition rate of 5 Hz, make the analog-digital conversion, and calculate the mean beam charge. The output signal can be sent to the <b>control</b> <b>command</b> <b>system</b> for displaying and to automate other process, especially the measurements of the beam charge versus RF/Laser phase. This system offers good accuracy, with a resolution of around 1 pC, and can be easily integrated in the <b>control</b> <b>command</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

30|$|On {{international}} trains, onboard {{equipment for}} the various national <b>control</b> <b>command</b> <b>systems</b> must be installed. This {{is becoming more and}} more expensive due to the increasing sophistication and expense of equipment. A train crossing several European countries must switch to the control-command systems in the country it crosses. So, in order to remove these obstacles through the European rail network, the European Commission encouraged the development of a signalling and management system common to all member states: the ERTMS system (European Rail Traffic Management System). This will, therefore, reduce the validation and certification costs of ERTMS component implementation in different member states. The objective of this research work is to facilitate the interoperability through the mutual recognition of the ERTMS components between the member states by proposing test scenarios enabling cover checking.|$|R

25|$|A 16 channel <b>command</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> named Zero 1 was {{introduced}} in late 1979. Zero 1 was based on digital, not analog, technology, and as such was a forerunner to the NMRA Digital <b>Command</b> <b>Control</b> (DCC) <b>system,</b> {{which appeared in the}} 1990s. Advertisements claimed that 16 locomotives could be operated independently at the same time. Though an important milestone, Zero 1 was not widely successful; the controller units and decoder modules required for the locomotives were expensive, but with clean track and well serviced locos the system worked well. Control of points and other accessories was available in a very simple manner. Locomotives equipped with a Zero 1 decoder could not be used on conventional direct current systems, making it difficult to run one's locomotives on friends' layouts or club layouts. This was a common issue with <b>command</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in that time period. Locomotives with no decoder could not be used on a Zero 1 layout either.|$|R
