40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} different enamel conditionings on the shear bond strength (SBS) and bond failure patterns of a resin modified glass ionomer cement (RMGIC) used to bond ceramic brackets. Methods: 105 human premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were divided into 7 groups according to the enamel surface treatments: conditioners (35 % phosphoric acid and 10 % polyacrylic acid), type of adhesive (Transbond(r) and Fuji Ortho LC <b>Capsule(r)),</b> washing time and drying of the surface. Results: A significant p 0. 05) to the group that had brackets bonded with composite resin. The two groups that had enamel prepared with polyacrylic acid and brackets bonded with GIC on a wet surface showed significantly lower shear bond strength {{than the control group}} (p< 0. 05). Conclusions: Moisture contamination decreased SBS, but not enough to preclude the use of RMGIC as an alternative to composite resin (CR) for direct bonding of ceramic brackets...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} about the growth of craniofacial that proposed by any scientist with different understanding background. The genetic theory described that genes determine all. Dominance Sutural theory according to Sicher, said that primary event in sutural growth is the proliferation of the connective tissue between two bones. The nasal septum theory from Scot showed that cartilage is a more pressure-tolerant tissue than the vascular -sensitive sutures. It presumably has the developmental capacity to expansively push the whole nasomaxillary complex downward and forward. Moss hypotheses suggest that bone and cartilage lack growth determination and grow in response to intrinsic growth of associated tissues. The associated tissues call "functional matrices". Each a component of a functional matrices perform a necessary service - such as resporation, mastication, speech, while the skeletal tissue support and protect the associated functional matrices. Functional matrices consist of periosteal and <b>capsuler.</b> Besides that, there are many factors to control craniofacial growth, such as natural and disruptive. The natural factors include function, general body growth, neurotrophism. While disruptive is orthodontic forces, surgery,malnutrition, malfunction, gross craniofacial anomalies...|$|E
