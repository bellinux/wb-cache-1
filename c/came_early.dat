5|$|Monteverdi's next {{commission}} from Mantua <b>came</b> <b>early</b> in 1618, when he {{was asked}} to provide the music for Andromeda, an opera based on the ancient Greek myth of the princess chained to a rock. The libretto was written by Duke Ferdinando's chancellor, Ercole Marigliani, and the project was sponsored by the duke's younger brother, Don Vincenzo Gonzaga. It is probable that the work was intended for performance at the Mantua Carnival of March 1618, but as Carter records, Monteverdi's approach to his Mantua commissions was often dilatory and half-hearted; his inability or unwillingness to work on Andromeda delayed its performance, first to 1619 and then to 1620.|$|E
5|$|Notre Dame {{opened the}} third quarter on offense, but Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix intercepted a Golson pass that gave Alabama {{possession}} at the Irish three-yard line. The Crimson Tide then drove 97 yards in ten plays that ended with a 34-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Amari Cooper that extended their lead to 35–0. Notre Dame then responded with their first points of the game on the drive that ensued with a two-yard Golson touchdown run that made the score 35–7. Alabama then began their final scoring drive of the night. The final Crimson Tide touchdown <b>came</b> <b>early</b> {{in the fourth quarter}} on a 19-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Cooper that capped a 14-play, 86-yard drive that took 7:41 off the clock and made the score 42–7. The Irish then made the final score 42–14 when Golson threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Theo Riddick. The teams then traded punts with the final play of the game being a short Notre Dame run as time expired.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbilt's {{first two}} touchdowns <b>came</b> <b>early.</b> After the kickoff went to Kentucky and the Wildcats' Saunders {{returned}} {{the ball to}} the 30-yard line, a punt was kicked to the Commodores; after a good return but little gain, the ball was punted back to Kentucky. Lavin fumbled on the return, and the ball was recovered by Neely on the 10-yard line. On third down, Frank Godchaux ran around the end for a touchdown; Rupert Smith scored the second and third touchdowns for the Commodores. After an exchange of punts, Vanderbilt began a drive on Kentucky's 32-yard line. Neely passed 22 yards to Pink Wade, with short runs by Smith and Bomar followed by Smith running around right end for a touchdown; Kentucky's Server kicked the ball into the end zone for a touchback. Alf Sharpe was ejected from the game for fighting, and the Commodores were penalized half the distance to the goal. Neely punted the ball to Lavin, who returned the ball five yards. On the next play, Lavin ran around the edge for 19 yards; three plays later, fullback Birkett Pribble carried the ball in for the score.|$|E

25|$|Education and {{religion}} were becoming increasingly important at this time, {{as a way}} to break class barriers through education and religious devotion. In 1828, there were eight government primary schools. By 1835 that number had increased to 29, with the number continuing to increase steadily over the next few years. Secondary education would remain in private hands well into the late 19th century. Libraries <b>came</b> <b>early</b> to Hobart Town, with a reading and Newspaper room established in 1822, and the Hobart Town Book Society opened in 1826, although the Tasmanian Public Library (now the State Library of Tasmania) did not open until 1870.|$|E

Seven plays later the Crimson Tide took a 3–0 lead on a 33-yard Brian Bostick field goal. Neither team would score again until late in the second quarter when James Wilhoit connected on a 31-yard field goal for the Vols and Bostick connected on a 48-yard field goal that made the halftime score 6–3.|$|E
25|$|Lewis {{made only}} two senior {{appearances}} for the Windwards, both during the 1988–89 season.

His second appearance for the Windwards <b>came</b> <b>early</b> the following month, against Guyana in {{the final of the}} 1988–89 Geddes Grant Shield (a limited-overs competition).

He made his first-class debut in a three-day fixture against KwaZulu-Natal Inland, and then played in the corresponding one-day fixture. In February 2014, Green was selected in Namibia's squad for the 2014 Under-19 World Cup, where he played in three matches. He scored a duck against Australia and four runs against Scotland, but against Canada scored 57 runs from 77 balls, featuring in a 93-run second-wicket stand with Malan Kruger.|$|E
25|$|His first {{achievement}} <b>came</b> <b>early</b> in 1951 {{when the}} Benjamin Franklin Library of Guadalajara presented {{an exhibition of}} his works.

At 25 years of age, he returned to his native land of Jalisco and abandoned his brief teaching duties to focus his career as a muralist. His second exhibition in Guadalajara featured the mural, El maíz en la Colonia, now lost. With an established recognition in the region, he was selected by then governor of Jalisco Agustín Yáñez to create two murals in the Public Library of the State, La imprenta en Jalisco (The Printing Press in Jalisco) and El parnaso jalisciense (The Jaliscan Parnassus), the latter of which is one of his most representative works.|$|E
25|$|Clark Steven Scarff (born 19 November 1948) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who played four {{first-class}} matches for Western Australia. From Perth, Scarff made his first-class debut in a Sheffield Shield match against Victoria in February 1970, the last match of the 1969–70 season. Batting third behind Derek Chadwick and Terry Prindiville, he scored a half-century—67 runs—on debut, featuring in a 131-run partnership with Chadwick for the second wicket. Scarff's three other first-class matches <b>came</b> <b>early</b> in the following Sheffield Shield season. Elevated to the opening position with Chadwick, he failed to score heavily, and did not play at state level again. At grade cricket level, Scarff played for Melville, and served as the club's captain-coach for the 1974–75 season. After retiring from playing, {{he worked for a}} time as a financial planner, and later moved to Geraldton, where he opened a management training and consulting firm.|$|E
