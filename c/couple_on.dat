5|$|Fuseli painted other {{versions}} of The Nightmare following {{the success of}} the first; at least three survive. The other important canvas was painted between 1790 and 1791 and is held at the Goethe Museum in Frankfurt. It is smaller than the original, and the woman's head lies to the left; a mirror opposes her on the right. The demon is looking at the woman rather than out of the picture, and it has pointed, catlike ears. The most significant difference in the remaining two versions is an erotic statuette of a <b>couple</b> <b>on</b> the table.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Longley, the Archbishop of Canterbury, {{married the}} <b>couple</b> <b>on</b> 10 March 1863 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The choice of venue was criticised widely. As the {{ceremony}} took place outside London, the press complained that large public crowds {{would not be}} able to view the spectacle. Prospective guests thought it awkward to get to and, as the venue was small, some people who had expected invitations were disappointed. The Danes were dismayed because only Alexandra's closest relations were invited. The British court was still in mourning for Prince Albert, so ladies were restricted to wearing grey, lilac or mauve. As the couple left Windsor for their honeymoon at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, they were cheered by the schoolboys of neighbouring Eton College, including Lord Randolph Churchill.|$|E
