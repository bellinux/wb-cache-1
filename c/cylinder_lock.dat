2500|$|Cash drawers {{that are}} {{integral}} to a stand-alone register {{often have a}} manual release catch underneath to open the drawer {{in the event of}} a power failure. More advanced cash drawers have eliminated the manual release in favor of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock,</b> requiring a key to manually open the drawer. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock</b> usually has several positions: locked, unlocked, online (will open if an impulse is given), and release. The release position is an intermittent position with a spring to push the cylinder back to the unlocked position. In the [...] "locked" [...] position, the drawer will remain latched even when an electric impulse is sent to the solenoid.|$|E

5000|$|M7A2 1951 - 1952: The {{only problem}} with the M7A1 was that {{sometimes}} the launcher would get stuck when fired or the gas <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock</b> would break. This rendered the rifle and launcher useless and required repair by an armorer with special tools. The jamming problem was solved by using a heavier spring-loaded piston on the launcher and introduced a redesigned grenade retaining spring. The M1 Garand was then modified with a distinctive dual gas <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock</b> (marked with a 'M', for [...] "modified") dubbed the [...] "high hump lock" [...] (ordnance part No. 7265871). The launcher had a mount machined into it to take a proposed leaf-sight that was never adopted.|$|E
5000|$|A magnetic-coded lock is a lock {{device that}} uses pins in {{combination}} with magnets to prevent entry by either non-matching keys by teething or magnetic polarity. Magnetic-coded locks encompass knob <b>locks,</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>locks,</b> lever locks, and deadbolt locks as well as applications in other security devices.|$|R

50|$|Commonly {{pin tumbler}} locks {{are found in}} a {{cylinder}} {{that can be easily}} unscrewed by a locksmith to facilitate rekeying. The first main advantage to a <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock,</b> also known as a profile <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock</b> or euro, is that the cylinder can be changed without altering the boltwork hardware. Removing the cylinder typically requires only loosening a set screw, then sliding the cylinder from the boltwork. The second is that it is usually possible to obtain, from various lock manufacturers, cylinders in different formats that can all be used with the same type of key. This allows the user to have keyed-alike, and master-keyed systems that incorporate a wide variety of different types of lock, such as nightlatches, deadbolts and roller door locks.|$|E

5000|$|M7A1 (Springfield Armory T95) 1945 - 1951: The {{major problem}} with the M7 grenade {{launcher}} is that it left the gas <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock</b> closed when attached, venting the cylinder. This meant the operator would have to cock the weapon to extract the spent cartridge and load a fresh one from the en-bloc clip. The M7A1 incorporated a spring-loaded piston designed to keep the gas cylinder closed when loaded until the grenade was fired, but then opened to allow normal semi-automatic function. The spring-loaded launcher also recoiled when fired, preventing damage to the rifle. The M1 Garand design was modified to use a hardened gas <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock</b> (marked with an 'H', for [...] "hardened") dubbed the [...] "flat-edged lock" [...] (ordnance part No. 7265959). This allowed prolonged use of the new launcher system.|$|E

50|$|The {{pin tumbler}} lock (or Yale lock, after lock {{manufacturers}} Yale) is {{a lock mechanism}} that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key.

50|$|Mortise locks have historically, {{and still}} {{commonly}} do, use lever locks as a mechanism. Older locks {{may have used}} warded locks. This {{has led to a}} popular confusion between the two; the term 'mortice lock' is widely known and used, but usually in reference to lever keys. In recent years the Euro <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock</b> has become common, using a pin tumbler lock in a mortice housing.|$|E
50|$|The Model 1889 {{differed}} from earlier Colt revolvers since its cylinder rotated counterclockwise instead of clockwise. This {{seems to have}} originated with U.S. Navy requirements, but the direction of rotation worked against the <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock</b> and tended to force the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. This weakness allowed the cylinder to rotate while holstered or even while the shooter was pulling the trigger.|$|E
5000|$|A deadlock, {{if it is}} {{cylinder}} operated, may {{be either}} single cylinder or double cylinder. A single cylinder deadlock will accept a key {{on one side of}} the lock, but is operated by a twist knob on the other side. Double <b>cylinder</b> <b>locks</b> will accept a key on both sides and therefore do not require (and often do not have) any twist knob. This prevents unwanted unlocking of the door by forced access to the interior twist knob (via a nearby window, for example). Double <b>cylinder</b> <b>locks</b> are sometimes banned from areas because they can be difficult to open from the inside and violate fire safety regulations. Some lock manufacturers also have a [...] "lockable" [...] knob: a key is always needed on one side (usually external), and a twist knob can be used on the other (internal), unless a button has been pressed, in which case a key is also needed on the internal side.|$|R
50|$|Strebor Diecasting (the {{name comes}} from Roberts spelled backwards) was a {{die-casting}} company in Radcliffe, Lancashire who achieved widespread notice as makers of <b>cylinder</b> <b>locks</b> and locking devices for the motor trade during the 1960s and 1970s under the STREBOR and STRONIS trade names. Their locks were to be found on British cars such as the Mini. The company was founded around 1930, and finally dissolved in 2003/2004 following a period of rundown and some industrial relations problems.|$|R

5000|$|A cash drawer {{is usually}} of strong {{construction}} {{and may be}} integral with the register or a separate piece that the register sits atop. It slides {{in and out of}} its lockable box and is secured by a spring-loaded catch. When a transaction that involves cash is completed, the register sends an electrical impulse to a solenoid to release the catch and open the drawer.Cash drawers that are integral to a stand-alone register often have a manual release catch underneath to open the drawer {{in the event of a}} power failure. More advanced cash drawers have eliminated the manual release in favor of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock,</b> requiring a key to manually open the drawer. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock</b> usually has several positions: locked, unlocked, online (will open if an impulse is given), and release.

5000|$|A lockset may {{be fitted}} with a keyable lock on inside, on outside, or not at all, the latter being known as a non-keyed lockset. If the lockset has a single keyed side, it is called a keyed, single-cylinder lockset, if both, a keyed, double-cylinder lockeset. In this aspect, the word [...] "cylinder" [...] refers to any type of keyed <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock,</b> {{rather than to the}} type of {{mechanism}} of the lockset.|$|E

40|$|DE 102006047939 A 1 UPAB: 20080501 NOVELTY - The {{system has}} a <b>locking</b> <b>cylinder</b> (3) that is formed for {{bidirectional}} data exchange by radio. A {{wireless access point}} (2 a) is formed for bidirectional data exchange per radio with the cylinder and a central management unit (1) i. e. personal computer. The unit is connected with the point for the bidirectional data exchange. An association request signal is transmitted from the cylinder.

50|$|A snap gun, {{also known}} as lock pick gun, pick gun, or {{electric}} lock pick, is a tool {{that can be used}} to force open a mechanical pin tumbler lock (a common type of <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock)</b> without using the key. A steel rod is inserted into the lock and the snap gun briefly fires the rod against all of the lock pins simultaneously, momentarily freeing the cylinder and enabling it to be turned using a tension wrench. The snap gun is an alternative to a conventional lockpick, which requires other techniques such as raking to free the pins.|$|E
50|$|Lock {{snapping}} is {{a method}} of forced entry that only affects certain types of <b>cylinder</b> <b>lock,</b> such as the euro cylinder which are commonly found on uPVC doors in Europe. Lock snapping involves applying a strong torque force to the lock cylinder, usually {{with a pair of}} locking pliers, thereby breaking the mechanism and allowing access to the latch. It can take between 50 seconds and 2 minutes to snap the lock and gain entry. Police in the UK have estimated that around 22 million doors throughout the country could be at risk from lock snapping.|$|E
