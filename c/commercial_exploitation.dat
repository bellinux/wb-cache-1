5|$|B.brownii occurs {{naturally}} only in two population clusters between Albany and the Stirling Range {{in southwest}} Western Australia. In the Stirling Range it occurs among heath on rocky mountain slopes; further south it occurs among jarrah woodland in shallow nutrient-poor sand. It is rare and endangered {{in its natural}} habitat, with all major populations currently threatened by Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, a disease to which the species is highly susceptible. Other threats include loss of habitat, <b>commercial</b> <b>exploitation</b> and changes to the fire regime.|$|E
5|$|The {{technology}} of oil transportation has evolved alongside the oil industry. Although human {{use of oil}} reaches to prehistory, the first modern <b>commercial</b> <b>exploitation</b> dates back to James Young's manufacture of paraffin in 1850. In the early 1850s, oil began to be exported from Upper Burma, then a British colony. The oil was moved in earthenware vessels to the river bank where it was then poured into boat holds for transportation to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Threats to B.brownii include loss {{of habitat}} due to land clearing, <b>commercial</b> <b>exploitation,</b> disease, and {{changes to the}} fire regime. The {{fragmentation}} of populations is also of concern, as it causes the genetic diversity of the species to decline, potentially reducing vigour. Climate change is also of concern: depending on the severity of change, the range of this species is predicted to contract by 30% to 50% by 2080.|$|E
40|$|<b>Commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation</b> is a complex, profitable, {{relatively}} low risk, and everchanging criminal enterprise that remains difficult to effectively address in policy and practice. Researchers throughout {{the last decade}} have begun exploring the unique role of the Internet in facilitating <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation</b> among vulnerable children and adults in the United States. This chapter will summarize current research on Internet-facilitated <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation,</b> and will discuss {{the ways in which}} cyberspace represents an increasingly anonymous market for sex buyers complicit in the victimization of children and adults. It will also critically examine the ways in which current efforts to address <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation</b> may be complicit in upholding structures that enable exploitation to flourish...|$|R
40|$|In 2014, Kiribati made {{a minimal}} {{advancement}} {{in efforts to}} eliminate the worst forms of child labor. It continued initiatives to raise awareness about child protection issues, including <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation.</b> The Government also trained police and prosecutors on trafficking in persons. However, children in Kiribati are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation.</b> The law does not prohibit hazardous occupations or activities for children, and existing laws fail to fully protect children under age 18 from all forms of <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation.</b> In addition, the Government did not make sufficient efforts to provide services to children engaged in <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation.</b> I. PREVALENCE AND SECTORAL DISTRIBUTION OF CHILD LABOR Children in Kiribati are engaged in the worst forms of child labor in <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation.</b> (1 - 3) Table 1 provides key indicators on children’s work and education in Kiribati.

5|$|Since the 17th century, peat {{has been}} cut for fuel for {{domestic}} heating and cooking and it is called turf when so used. The process accelerated as <b>commercial</b> <b>exploitation</b> of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale exploitation became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called Bord na Móna. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used {{in a number of}} industries, especially electricity generation though peat is being combined with biomass for dual-firing electricity generation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>commercial</b> <b>exploitation</b> of {{the series}} for the home video market {{achieved}} record sales and remained strong over a decade later. The fame of the show has grown through home video sales, which exceeded {{two or three times}} the sales of other contemporary anime series and films. The series contributed significantly to the spread of the DVD format in Japan and generated a considerable impact on the Japanese economy, calculated in billions of yen. A 2007 estimate placed the total value of the franchise at over 150 billion yen.|$|E
5|$|Among the Ainu, the otter {{is portrayed}} as an {{occasional}} messenger between humans and the creator. The sea otter is a recurring figure in Ainu folklore. A major Ainu epic, the Kutune Shirka, tells the tale of wars and struggles over a golden sea otter. Versions of a widespread Aleut legend tell of lovers or despairing women who plunge into the sea and become otters. These links {{have been associated with}} the many human-like behavioral features of the sea otter, including apparent playfulness, strong mother-pup bonds and tool use, yielding to ready anthropomorphism. The beginning of <b>commercial</b> <b>exploitation</b> had a great impact on the human, as well as animal, populations the Ainu and Aleuts have been displaced or their numbers are dwindling, while the coastal tribes of North America, where the otter is in any case greatly depleted, no longer rely as intimately on sea mammals for survival.|$|E

5|$|Despite its size, {{the common}} {{thresher}} is minimally dangerous to humans {{due to its}} relatively small teeth and timid disposition. It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat, fins, hide, and liver oil; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range. This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook-and-line. The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long, {{a case in point}} being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s. With <b>commercial</b> <b>exploitation</b> increasing {{in many parts of the}} world, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Most Doctor Who episodes {{were made}} on two-inch {{videotape}} for initial broadcast and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further <b>commercial</b> <b>exploitation.</b> Enterprises used 16mm for overseas sales as it was considerably cheaper to buy and easier to transport than videotape. It also circumvented the problem of different countries' incompatible video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not. The BBC had no central archive at the time; the Film Library kept programmes {{that had been made}} on film, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes. BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable. They had little dedicated storage space, and tended to place piles of film canisters wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as a {{defendant}} in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated the vagaries of litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the <b>commercial</b> <b>exploitation</b> of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished for some time and were not being policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation.|$|E

40|$|Topic of the thesis: <b>Commercial</b> Sexual <b>Exploitation</b> of Children The {{topic of}} this thesis is <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation</b> of children, which {{represents}} fundamental violation of children's rights. It comprises {{sexual abuse by}} an adult and remuneration in money or non-monetary benefits to the child or to a third party. The child is treated as a sexual object and as a commercial object. The thesis is divided into five parts. The first chapter is dedicated to theoretical introduction to the phenomenon of <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation</b> of children, the process of its recognition and the current situation. Criminological aspects are also mentioned. The second chapter deals with international treatment of protection of children against <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation</b> and turns attention to documents adopted by the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, the International Tourism Organization, the Council of Europe and the European Union. The core of this thesis is elaborated on in the third chapter, which focuses on criminal protection of children against <b>commercial</b> sexual <b>exploitation</b> in the Czech Republic and concentrates on {{the analysis of the}} elements of crimes penalizing various aspects of this phenomenon. The analysis is divided by the forms of actions into trafficking of children, [...] ...|$|R
