5|$|Medical procedures, {{such as the}} {{insertion}} of a <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter</b> {{into one of the}} chest veins or the taking of biopsy samples from lung tissue, may lead to pneumothorax. The administration of positive pressure ventilation, either mechanical ventilation or non-invasive ventilation, can result in barotrauma (pressure-related injury) leading to a pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|A special but unusual {{consideration}} is cardiogenic shock, where {{the blood pressure}} is decreased not due to dehydration but due to inability of the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels. This situation requires ICU admission, monitoring of the central venous pressure (which requires the insertion of a <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter</b> in a large upper body vein), and the administration of medication that increases the heart pumping action and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|Some {{risk factors}} {{influence}} {{the location of}} DVT within the body. In isolated distal DVT, the profile of risk factors appears distinct from proximal DVT. Transient factors, such as surgery and immobilization, appear to dominate, whereas thrombophilias and age {{do not seem to}} increase risk. In upper-extremity DVT, the most important risk factor is having a <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter,</b> and thoracic outlet syndrome also increases risk.|$|E

5|$|Between 1945 and 1952, optical {{engineers}} {{built upon}} the earlier work of Rudolph Schindler (1888â€“1968), developing the first gastrocamera. In 1964, optical fiber technology {{was applied to}} one of these early gastrocameras to produce the first flexible fiberoptic endoscope. Initially used in upper GI endoscopy, this device was first used for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter.</b>|$|E
5|$|If the {{systolic}} {{blood pressure}} falls below 90 mmHg {{within days of the}} injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, resulting in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter,</b> intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} shock, a <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter,</b> a {{peripherally}} inserted central catheter (PICC), venous cutdown or intraosseous infusion may be necessary.|$|E

3000|$|Most data on {{management}} of temporary dialysis catheters come from studies on indwelling dialysis catheters {{in patients with}} end-stage renal failure or from studies on <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> in intensive care.

40|$|The use of <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters,</b> while advantageous, is {{associated}} with a range of complications including thrombosis and infection.

A clitical appraisal of the two randomized controlled trials examining this topic in critically ill patients has shown that heparin-bonded <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> significantly reduced the incidence of catheterrelated thrombosis and infection in children and adults.

25|$|In prerenal AKI without fluid overload, {{administration}} of intravenous fluids is typically {{the first step}} to improving kidney function. Volume status may be monitored {{with the use of a}} <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter</b> to avoid over- or under-replacement of fluid.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{intravenous}} methods of drug delivery, known as vascular access devices. These include the winged infusion device, peripheral venous catheter, midline catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter</b> and implantable port. The devices have different applications regarding duration of chemotherapy treatment, method of delivery {{and types of}} chemotherapeutic agent.|$|E
25|$|Other {{advantages}} are {{that because it}} empties near the heart, medications can also be quickly distributed {{to the rest of}} the body. As there is room for multiple parallel compartments (lumen) within the catheter, so that multiple medications can be delivered at once even if they would not be chemically compatible within a single tube. Caregivers can also measure central venous pressure and other physiological variables through the line. It is commonly believed that fluid can be pushed faster through a <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter</b> but as they are often divided into multiple lumens then the internal diameter is less than that of a large-bore peripheral cannula. They are also longer, which as reflected in Poiseuille's law, requires higher pressure to achieve the same flow, all other variables being equal.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{efficacy}} of heparinization in prolonging patency of arterial and <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> in children. A randomized double-blind trial in a tertiary 10 -bed pediatric intensive care unit {{was used to evaluate}} 300 children (age older than 4 weeks, younger than 18 years). Trial medication consisted of either NaCl 0. 9 % infusion or NaCl 0. 9 % infusion to which 1 IU of heparin per milliliter was added. The number of nonpatent arterial and <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> and the duration of stay of patent arterial and <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> were measured. There was a significant risk increase for nonpatency in the nonheparinized arterial catheters (relative risk [W: 3. 54, 95 % confidence interval[CI]: 1. 01 - 12. 42). No significant risk increase for nonpatency could be demonstrated for the nonheparinized <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheters</b> (PLR: 7. 63; 95 % CL 0. 40 - 145).

25|$|Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897â€“1989) also {{achieved}} significant {{advances in}} techniques for tracheal intubation when he introduced his new curved laryngoscope blade in 1943. The Macintosh blade remains {{to this day}} {{the most widely used}} laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation. In 1949, Macintosh published a case report describing the novel use of a gum elastic urinary catheter as an endotracheal tube introducer to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation. Inspired by Macintosh's report, P. Hex Venn (who was at that time the anesthetic advisor to the British firm Eschmann Brothers & Walsh, Ltd.) set about developing an endotracheal tube introducer based on this concept. Venn's design was accepted in March 1973, and {{what became known as the}} Eschmann endotracheal tube introducer went into production later that year. The material of Venn's design was different from that of a gum elastic bougie in that it had two layers: a core of tube woven from polyester threads and an outer resin layer. This provided more stiffness but maintained the flexibility and the slippery surface. Other differences were the length (the new introducer was , which is much longer than the gum elastic bougie) and the presence of a 35Â° curved tip that let it be steered around obstacles. The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a <b>central</b> <b>venous</b> <b>catheter.</b>|$|E

When DVT does not grow, it can be cleared naturally and dissolved into the blood (fibrinolysis). Veins in the calf or thigh are most commonly affected, including the femoral vein, the popliteal vein, and the iliofemoral vein (as with Mayâ€“Thurner syndrome). Extensive lower-extremity DVT can reach into the iliac vein of the pelvis or the inferior vena cava.
