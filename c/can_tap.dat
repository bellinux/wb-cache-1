5|$|Tim Schafer, the game's {{creative}} director, {{was inspired}} to create the game by his own past musical experiences. The game features the character of Eddie Riggs, voiced by and modeled after Jack Black, a roadie who is transported to a fantasy world inspired by the artwork of heavy metal album covers. Eddie becomes the world's savior, leading the down-trodden humans against a range of supernatural overlords using a battle axe, his Flying V guitar that <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> into the magical powers of the world, and a customizable hot rod.|$|E

Happy Feet was released on November 17, 2006, and has grossed over $380 million worldwide. The movie also received a Golden Globe Award nomination and won an Academy Award and a BAFTA for Best Animated Feature. Day Zero, a drama about the draft in the United States, had its debut at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival. Wood portrays draftee Aaron Feller.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{memory is}} a person’s {{knowledge}} of the space around them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, {{and how to get}} to and from them. Spatial memory is distinct from object memory and involves different parts of the brain. Spatial memory involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However many times both types of memory are used together, such as when trying to remember where you put a lost object. A classic test of spatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The amount of blocks they <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. Spatial memory is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is.|$|E

David Browne from Entertainment Weekly {{was impressed by the}} song and said [...] "'Hung Up' shows how effortlessly she [...] <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> into her petulant inner teen". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine compared the song to the remix of Gwen Stefani's 2004 single [...] "What You Waiting For?". Ed Gonzalez from the same magazine called the song the biggest hit of her career. Margaret Moser from The Austin Chronicle said that the song strobes and pulses along with another album track [...] "Forbidden Love". Peter Robinson from The Guardian commented that [...] "Hung Up" [...] is Madonna's [...] "most wonderfully commercial single since the mid Eighties". Alexis Petridis from The Guardian said that the song could have been more campy by addition of Liza Minnelli inspired vocals in the background and lyrics which talk about Larry Grayson.|$|E

2500|$|People tend to {{experience}} their reality as stressful, according to HR, {{when they are}} having insecure or negative thoughts. But HR suggests that such thoughts {{do not have to}} be taken seriously. When one chooses to take them more lightly, according to HR, the mind quiets down and positive feelings emerge spontaneously. Thus, HR also teaches that people have health and well-being already within them (in HR this is known as [...] "innate health"), ready to emerge as soon as their troubled thinking calms down. When this happens, according to HR, people also gain access to common sense, and they <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> into the universal capacity for creative problem solving or [...] "inner wisdom."

2500|$|Every {{emperor penguin}} sings a unique song called a [...] "heartsong" [...] {{to attract a}} mate. If the male penguin's heartsong matches the female's song, the two {{penguins}} mate. Norma Jean, a female penguin, falls for Memphis, a male penguin and they become mates. They lay an egg, which is left in Memphis' care, while Norma Jean leaves with the other females to fish. While the males struggle through the harsh winter, Memphis briefly drops the egg. As a result, Mumble is unable to sing, but he <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> dance instead. Nevertheless, he is enamored with Gloria, a female penguin who {{is regarded as the}} most talented of her age. One day, Mumble encounters a group of hostile skua, with a leader who is tagged with a yellow band, which he says is from an alien abduction. Mumble narrowly escapes the hungry birds by falling into a crevice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{title is}} taken from the game's main premise – that {{industrial}} espionage runs rampant in a near-future setting. [...] A shadowrun – a successful data theft or physical break-in at a rival corporation or organization – {{is one of the}} main tools employed by both corporate rivals and underworld figures. [...] Deckers (futuristic hackers) who <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> into an immersive, three-dimensional cyberspace are opposed by rival deckers and lethal, potentially brain-destroying artificial intelligences called [...] "Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics" [...] – [...] "ICE" [...] for short –, who are protected by street fighters and/or mercenaries, often with cyborg implants (called cyberware), magicians, and other exotic figures, on such missions as they seek access, physical or remote, to the power structures of rival groups.

2500|$|Millennia {{later in}} Dune, the Bene Gesserit base {{of power is}} the Mother School on the planet Wallach IX, whose {{graduates}} are fit mates for Emperors, and whose specially trained Truthsayers can detect falsehood. But beyond the outer virtues of poise, self-control, and diplomacy, Bene Gesserit training includes superior combat skills and precise physiological control that grants them direct control over conception and embryotic sex determination, ageing, and even the ability to render poisons harmless within their bodies. The Bene Gesserit power of Voice allows them to control others by merely modulating their vocal tones. Sisters who survive a ritualized poisoning known as the spice agony achieve increased awareness and abilities through access to Other Memory, and are subsequently known as Reverend Mothers. Every member of the Bene Gesserit is conditioned into singular loyalty to the order and its goals with allegiances to even family being secondary, and no goal is more paramount than the Sisterhood's large-scale breeding program. It aims to create a superbeing that <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> into abilities even the Bene Gesserit cannot, a being whom they can use {{in order to gain}} more direct control over the universe. To this end, the Bene Gesserit have subtly manipulated bloodlines for generations, using breeding sisters to [...] "collect" [...] the genes they require.|$|E

2500|$|In {{places such}} as Kerala where {{coconuts}} are in abundance, the half shell of coconut {{was used as the}} latex collection container. Glazed pottery or aluminium or plastic cups became [...] more common in Kerala and other countries. The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree. This wire incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows. The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised [...] "spout" [...] knocked into the bark. Tapping normally takes place early in the morning, when the internal pressure of the tree is highest. A good tapper <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-spiral system, and a common daily [...] "task" [...] size is between 450 and 650 trees. Trees are usually tapped on alternate or third days, although many variations in timing, length and number of cuts are used. [...] "Tappers would make a slash in the bark with a small hatchet. These slanting cuts allowed latex to flow from ducts located on the exterior or the inner layer of bark (cambium) of the tree. Since the cambium controls the growth of the tree, growth stops if it is cut. Thus, rubber tapping demanded accuracy, so that the incisions would not be too many given the size of the tree, or too deep, which could stunt its growth or kill it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Excavations may {{be simple}} {{depressions}} dug {{up in the}} substrate, such as the nests of bowfin, smallmouth bass, and Pacific salmon, {{but it can also}} consist of fairly large burrows used for shelter and for nesting. Burrowing species include the mudskippers, the red band-fish Cepola rubescens (burrows up to 1 m deep, often with a side branch), the yellowhead jawfish Opistognathus aurifrons (chambers up to 22cm deep, lined with coral fragments to solidify it), the convict blenny Pholidichthys leucotaenia [...] whose burrow is a maze of tunnels and chambers thought to be as much as 6 m long, and the Nicaragua cichlid, Hypsophrys nicaraguensis, who drills a tunnel by spinning inside of it. [...] In the case of the mudskippers, the burrows are shaped like a J and can be as much as 2 m deep. Two species, the giant mudskipper Periophthalmodon schlosseri and the walking goby Scartelaos histophorus, build a special chamber at the bottom of their burrows into which they carry mouthfuls of air. Once released the air accumulates {{at the top of the}} chamber and forms a reserve from which the fish can breathe – like all amphibious fishes, mudskippers are good air breathers. If researchers experimentally extract air from the special chambers, the fish diligently replenish it. The significance of this behaviour stems from the facts that at high tide, when water covers the mudflats, the fish stay in their burrow to avoid predators, and water inside the confined burrow is often poorly oxygenated. At such times these air-breathing fishes <b>can</b> <b>tap</b> into the air reserve of their special chambers.|$|E
