The level of unemployment, income inequality and poverty levels are largely affected by <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> and the <b>economic</b> cycles. <b>Economic</b> <b>policies</b> can also influence the occurrence of economic cycles which in turn influence socioeconomic factors and therefore health inequalities. <b>Economic</b> <b>policies</b> are influenced by political considerations as the historical record of many countries indicates. The paper discusses the conduct and the effects of <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> on health inequalities. It starts with a discussion of the need and of the instruments of <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> and also its effectiveness in smoothing the economic cycle. It also examines the interplay between main policy targets such as unemployment and inflation with political considerations.

This paper looks into how justified the link between Keynes's theory and the Nazi German <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> really is. The first part introduces Keynes's ideas on <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> and his vision of society. These are in the second part confronted with the <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> of the Nazi Germany (and partly that of Bolshevik Russia) and common components are identified. The conclusion is that despite his explicit repudiation of socialism and dictatorship and his efforts to "save" capitalism, Keynes's concept of <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> was similar to the <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> of Nazi Germany and opened the way towards socialism and planning. <b>economic</b> <b>policy,</b> Germany, Keynes, Hitler, socialism...|$|R
