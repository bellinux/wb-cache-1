40|$|A {{calorimeter}} {{has been}} constructed to accurately measure insulation performance with a nominal 90 K cold outer boundary and a 20 K inner boundary. Unique {{features of this}} design include use of mechanical cryocoolers instead cryogens and measurement of the heat load with a <b>calibrated</b> <b>rod</b> {{to serve as a}} conduction path. The calorimeter is operational and has completed its first test series. The initial test series was designed to look for differences in performance between a single layer of aluminum foil and a sheet of double aluminized mylar (DAM). Although it has been speculated that the aluminum foil would perform better, since the mylar coating might not thick enough to stop the transmission of long wave length infrared radiation, our testing showed a higher heat load for the aluminum foil than the DAM. The aluminum foil showed a heat load of 132 mW at an 87 K outer temperature and 152 mW at a 107 K outer temperature. Whereas the DAM showed a heat load of 66 mW at an 88 K outer temperature and 81 mW at 108 K...|$|E
40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} occurring {{within the}} vadose zone, especially in heterogeneous soils and tills {{typical of the}} Canadian shield, are not well understood. This research investigates {{the importance of the}} vadose zone in a small headwater basin (Harp 4 - 21) in the Canadian shield with respect to the generation of stream runoff quantity and quality during episodic rainfall and snowmelt events. The study focused specifically on: ﬁrstly the effect of variable antecedent moisture conditions on water-table and stream response, secondly, the significance of the stored vadose water in water extracted from a rising water-table, and thirdly the significance of preferential flowpathways in the vadose zone as a means of rapidly rotating, stored vadose water to the stream during runoff events. The instrumentation of the Harp 4 - 21 basin includes three v-notch weirs along the stream, numerous piezometers and wells, several soil lysimeters, and three tensiometer nests. Much of the data used in this study was obtained from five sites located along a hillslope transect. Soil water content at each of the hillslope sites was accurately determined using time domain reflectometry (TDR), whereas water table elevations were measured using both electronic water level tapes and <b>calibrated</b> <b>rod</b> ﬂoats. Preferential flowpath data was derived from ﬂow gauging and chemical analyses of water samples. Results obtained from the near-stream and lower slope reaches of the hillslope transect indicated that soil water content in the vadose zone is maintained at a high level of saturation by shallow water-table depths. Further analysis of simultaneously measured soil water content and depth to water—table data clearly showed that the existence of a thick essentially saturated zone overlying the water table (capillary fringe) was responsible for the large and rapid water-table responses observed during many of the nine studied precipitation events. On a basin scale, the seasonal variability of the area in which the capillary fringe extended to the ground surface was largely responsible for the observed trend in basin yield (runoff volume/ rainfall volume) for the nine runoff events. Chemical tracing results using silica, pH and DOC showed that the large vadose water reservoir in the near-stream and lower slope areas was a dominant component in water extracted from a rising water-table during most precipitation events. Silica results from the near-stream vadose zone showed that only the massive groundwater recharge associated with spring snowmelt could completely replace the vadose water reservoir with shorter residence time snowmelt/rainfall water. The rapid routing of stored near-stream capillary fringe vadose water through preferential pathways (macropores, soil pipes) was a significant source of runoff to the stream during runoff events. The presence of soil pipes, along with the significant vadose water reservoir in near-stream and lower slope areas are sufficient to explain the large phreatic/vadose water component typically identified in two component flow separation models, and constitutes the basis of a physically-based conceptual runoff model for the Harp 4 - 21 basin...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity in a heterogeneous nuclear reactor is presented. The method, which is used during normal operation, requires that <b>calibrated</b> control <b>rods</b> be oscillated in a special way at a high reactor power level. The value of the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity is found from the measured flux responses to these oscillations. Application of the method in a Savannah River reactor charged with natural uranium is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{expect that}} digital level will produce height reading quickly and reliably. But is the reading correct? That {{we must find}} out by <b>calibrating</b> <b>rod</b> scale or even better the rod and the level together. In this paper we have done both. For some years we have been {{comparing}} modern levelling systems ie. digital levels and bar code invar rods using the vertical comparator of the Finnish Geodetic Institute. Our customers come from Baltic and Nordic countries where the precise levelling work {{is still going on}} busily. In our laboratory it is possible to vary both sight length and temperature for simulating outdoor circumstances. In this study we included six digital levels and nine invar <b>rods,</b> which were <b>calibrated</b> in 2006 - 2008. Digital levels were made by Leica and Trimble. We used three meters long invar rods with aluminium frame. The aim of our research was to compare the results of system and rod calibrations to find out their characteristics. Our results showed that scale corrections of levelling systems are compatible with those of rods. We estimate that the accuracy of system calibration can be of order ± 3 µm/m with short sighting distance. According to our tests there is no clear dependence of sight length. But the thermal expansion factor of the whole levelling system can exceed remarkably the value attained purely from rod scale. For this ground we think that full calibration of digital levelling system is very important...|$|R
40|$|The TIESTE-MINOSSE code, {{developed}} at the ENEA to preliminarily investigate core dynamics relevant to metal cooled fast reactor and ADS, has been implemented to analyse transients in the RC 1 1 MW swimming pool TRIGA reactor existing at the Casaccia Centre. In {{the first part of}} the work, the TIESTE-MINOSSE improvement and validation on TRIGA dynamics is described. In particular, reactivity insertion measurements made during the first tests of the RC 1 TRIGA are analysed and the resulting fuel feedback features are compared with statically measured temperature and power coefficients, obtained by measuring both the fuel temperature and the reactivity of a <b>calibrated</b> control <b>rod</b> at different power levels. The comparison shows a significant agreement between the mentioned analysis of TRIGA dynamics and the more recent power coefficient static measurements. In the second part of the work, some transients in sub-critical core configurations relevant to TRADE are preliminary analysed...|$|R

50|$|The {{ground was}} cleared of bushes and a {{preliminary}} {{measurement of the}} line was carried out with a 100 ft. steel chain of 100 links prepared by Jesse Ramsden. It was the intention to measure more accurately {{with a set of}} three <b>calibrated</b> deal <b>rods</b> about 20 ft. in length. Three rods at a time were supported on trestles and the ends aligned to an accuracy of a thousandth part of an inch. The first rod was then carried {{to the end of the}} third, an operation to be repeated 1370 times. Unfortunately the deal rods had to be abandoned because of their susceptibility to lengthen and shorten in wet weather, and they were replaced by one inch thick glass rods of the same length. The rods were not affected by humidity but it was important to correct for thermal expansion. There was also a correction to sea level since the calculation of the survey was referred to that height. The final measurement gives the length of the base as 27404.01 ft. The measurement of the baseline to such a high standard of precision was a remarkable achievement and in recognition the Royal Society awarded Roy the Copley Medal in 1785.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{chemical}} {{interaction between}} Al-Si melts of different compositions and graphite {{was investigated in}} order to clarify the mechanism of spontaneous growth of silicon carbide crystals from these melts. <b>Calibrated</b> graphite small <b>rods</b> were used as carbon source to facilitate comparison between experiments. For a temperature set to 1100 °C, the reaction time and Si content of the melt were varied from 1 to 48 hours and 20 to 40 at. %, respectively. It {{has been found that}} in a first stage the liquid reacts at a relatively slow rate to form a microcrystalline SiC layer around the graphite rod. When this SiC layer has reached a certain thickness, a violent attack follows in some specific sites by rapid dissolution of the rod. Radial liquid channels progress {{from the surface of the}} rod up to its centre and then total conversion of graphite into SiC rapidly occurs. The local Si content of the melt, which controls the carbon solubility in the liquid, governs the overall mechanism. To form faceted β-SiC crystals, the growth mechanism should involve carbon dissolution in one place and supersaturation in another place in relation with local changes of the Si content in the melt...|$|R

TLD dosimetry was per-formed using 120 cylindrical LiF TLD type- 100 <b>rods</b> <b>calibrated</b> using a 6 MV photon beam. They were irradiated in solid water phantoms for the experimental determination of the seed dose rate constant, radial dose functions and anisotropy functions. MC simulations were performed for the determination of the TLDs relative energy response that was found position independent and equal to 1. 40 +/- 0. 03, and for the calculation of the ratio of dose in liquid water to dose in solid water that was found to be well described by D-liquid water/D-solid (water) = 1. 013 *r+ 0. 030 presenting only a minor dependence on polar angle. The selectSeed dose rate constant in liquid water was found equal to 0. 938 +/- 0. 065 cGy h(- 1) U- 1, which agrees within experimental uncertainties with corresponding MC results of Lambda(select Seed) = 0. 954 +/- 0. 005 cGy h(- 1) U- 1. The experimental radial dose and anisotropy function results were also found in good agreement with corresponding MC calculations. (C) 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the details about calibration of defects; wear and broken wires by electromagnetic method in a wire rope used for hoisting {{of men and}} material in mines, aerial rope ways, lifts etc. Electromagnetic method of testing the wire ropes consists of powerful magnets to magnetize the wire rope, and sensors to detect the defects in the wire ropes. A typical instrument used in the investigation consists of the inner coil to detect the local defects like corrosion, pitting, broken wire, wear and nicks. Outer coil (Hall sensor) detects the loss in metallic area. The major problem in analyzing the defects {{is due to the}} presence of the noise generated due to construction of the wire rope, which interferes with the signals due to the defects. Outer coil (LMA) signals are easy to analyse, as the shift in voltage from the base line is easily correlated with the loss in area <b>calibrated</b> using calibration <b>rod</b> before recording the test data. The difficulty arises in analyzing the inner coil signals, which detects the signals from wear, nicks and broken wire, which cannot be distinguished if they are of the same magnitude. In the present study a method was adopted to simulate the magnitude of the defect signals of wear and broken wear by creating artificially in the laboratory, which can be used for analyzing the actual signals recorded during in-situ testing on wire ropes...|$|R
40|$|Argonne National Laboratory is {{currently}} {{developing a new}} reactor control system for the McClellan Nuclear Radiation Facility. This new control system not only provides the same functionality as the existing control system in terms of graphic displays of reactor process variables, data archival capability, and manual, automatic, pulse and square-wave modes of operation, but adds to the functionality of the previous control system by incorporating signal processing algorithms for the validation of sensors and automatic calibration and verification of control rod worth curves. With the inclusion of these automated features, {{the intent of this}} control system is not to replace the operator but to make the process of controlling the reactor easier and safer for the operator. For instance, an automatic control rod calibration method reduces the amount of time to <b>calibrate</b> control <b>rods</b> from days to minutes, increasing overall reactor utilization. The control rod calibration curve, determined using the automatic calibration system, can be validated anytime after the calibration, as long as the reactor power is between 50 W and 500 W. This is done by banking all of the rods simultaneously and comparing the tabulated rod worth curves with a reactivity computer estimate. As long as the deviation between the tabulated values and the reactivity estimate is within a prescribed error band, then the system is in calibration. In order to minimize the amount of information displayed, only the essential flux-related data are displayed in graphical format on the control screen. Information from the sensor validation methods is communicated to the operators via messages, which appear in a message window. The messages inform the operators that the actual process variables do not correlate within the allowed uncertainty in the reactor system. These warnings, however, cannot cause the reactor to shutdown automatically. The reactor operator has the ultimate responsibility of using this information to either keep the reactor operating or to shut the reactor down. In addition to new developments in the signal processing realm, the new control system will be migrating from a PC-based computer platform to a Sun Solaris-based computer platform. The proven history of stability and performance of the Sun Sohuis operating system are the main advantages to this change. The I/O system will also be migrating from a PC-based data collection system, which communicates plant data to the control computer using RS- 232 connections, to an Ethernet-based I/O system. The Ethernet Data Acquisition System (EDAS) modules from Intelligent Instrumentation, Inc. provide an excellent solution for embedded control of a system using the more universally-accepted data transmission standard of TCP/IP. The modules contain a PROM, which operates all of the functionality of the I/O module, including the TCP/IP network access. Thus the module does not have an internal, sophisticated operating system to provide functionality but rather a small set hard-coded of instructions, which almost eliminates the possibility of the module failing due to software problems. An internal EEPROM can be modified over the Internet to change module configurations. Once configured, the module is contacted just like any other Internet host using TCP/IP socket calls. The main advantage to this architecture is its flexibility, expandability, and high throughput...|$|R
