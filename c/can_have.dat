5|$|An inverse agonist <b>can</b> <b>have</b> effects {{similar to}} those of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity <b>can</b> <b>have</b> inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also inhibit the basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.|$|E
