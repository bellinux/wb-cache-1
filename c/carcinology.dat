40|$|Based on larval literature, an {{identification}} key has been constructed for the megalopae of 55 species of Mediterranean Brachyura. This key is based mainly on external morphological characteristics visible, {{by using a}} microscope, limiting the necessity for dissection of specimens. Characteristics used include presence/absence of ornamentation on the carapace, number of abdominal somites, number and position of setae and/or spines on antennula, antenna, pereiopods and structure of uropods, etc. Partial dissection is only required to count the setae on the scaphognathite margin. Using the above characters, {{it is also possible}} to gather almost all the families into groups. However, the megalopae of Portunidae {{as well as those of}} the three species of Brachynotus genus are similar to each other and their identification at a specific level requires the use of features somehow variable and difficult to count. In the Majidae, the megalopae of 14 species are already known. The complexity of morphological characters typical of this family makes it difficult to define characters common to all spider crab megalopae. Nevertheless, the key may be an aid for <b>carcinology</b> studies, especially those including sorting and identification of megalopae from plankton samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} behavior {{of fresh water}} Anostracan has not been massively studied by the <b>carcinology</b> specialized literature, regarding especially the Dendrocephalus brasiliensis Pesta, 1921, about which there are abundant studies only on the geographical distribution of that Anostracan. The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the {{reproductive behavior}} of this Anostracan in different periods (dry and rainy). For this, mature individuals of both sexes were used. They were collected in four ponds of the Fish Farming Station of Paulo Afonso (FFSPA), by monthly capture in each pond, within the period from December 2004 to November 2005. The reproduction type was observed by placing some females in aquariums with males and placing the other ones individually, starting from the nauplii phase, where they stayed for 15 days (reproductive age). The individuals' sexual proportion was calculated by the relative frequencies of males and of females, every month, for the whole collection period. At 10 days cysts production is possible and the number of produced cysts is related {{to the size of the}} female. The ratio male:female in the studied period was of 1 male to 1. 07 female.

The symposium comprised 23 invited lectures and 46 posters on different aspects of crustacean phylogenetics. Papers published {{in this and the}} previous 150 years after Darwin’s ‘Origin of Species ’ and 100 years after W. T. Calman’s influential treatment on crustacean morphology and classification, crustacean phylogenetics remains an active, exciting and controversial field of research. An international symposium held from 7 th – 11 th October 2008 at the University of Rostock attempted to summarize the latest developments. Molecular evidence suggests that crustaceans are paraphyletic with regard to the hexapods, though a few potential apomorphies of Crustacea can still be named. If Crustacea do turn out to be paraphyletic, the name should disappear from formal classifications, as simply including hexapods in the group would be tantamount to ignoring the different research histories. Nevertheless, ‘crustaceans ’ will remain a colloquial term and crustaceanology (<b>carcinology)</b> an important field of research. Within crustaceans, Branchiopoda and Malacostraca are well supported monophyla. While the internal phylogeny of Branchiopoda seems almost to be settled, it is still highly controversial within Malacostraca, in particular with regard to the peracarid taxa. The same can be said of the Decapoda. It remains uncertain whether th...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the crabs}} {{from the sea}} around the Tsushima Islands in the {{northwest}} of Kyushu collected by the research vessel 'Genkai ' for the trustees of the National Science Museum, Tokyo, a small curious crab was found. It is referable to the section Dromiacea on account of having the first pleopods in the female. After our close examination and the much consultation with Dr. I. Gordon and Dr. D. Guinot, the sole ovigerous female was proved to represent not only a new species but also a new genus. In the Dromiacea it bears some unusual features such as {{the absence of the}} vestiges of the uropods, the forwards position of the anterior margins of the third maxillipeds, the absence of the distinct linea dromiidica, the strong backwards extension of the abdomen bending at the fourth segment, and the flattened propodi and talon-like dactyli of the last two legs.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{the summer}} of 1954, I {{received}} an invitation from the Netherlands New Guinea Government to undertake a faunistic investigation of the fish fauna of the area. It was thought advisable {{for the promotion of}} the local New Guinea fisheries, to first obtain a more thorough knowledge of the fish fauna of the region, based on a collection as complete as could be attained within a reasonable time. As such a collecting trip could be expected to yield results of considerable zoological and zoogeographical importance, I gladly accepted this unique opportunity. A most fortunate circumstance was that my visit coincided with an already previously planned collecting trip to the same area by two of my colleagues, Dr. L. D. Brongersma, at the time deputy-director and curator of herpetology, now director of the Leiden Museum, and Dr. L. B. Holthuis, curator of <b>carcinology</b> at the same institution. The resulting mutual assistance and pooling of technical facilities subsequently proved to contribute notably to the success of my explorations. While the voyage was sponsored by the Netherlands Government, numerous facilities and much, often indispensable, support were rendered by the Government of Netherlands New Guinea, by the Royal Netherlands Navy, by the missions of the Dutch Reformed Church and the Roman Catholic Church, and by the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Invaluable further assistance was received from private persons too numerous to be mentioned here all by name.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the cooperation of nurses and nutrition therapists within one multidisciplinary team. The theoretical part focuses on the multidisciplinary team, its tasks and also on what members of medical staff belong to the team and their role in the team. The next part describes the relations between medical staff members and their problems. The following parts describe the education, competences and responsibilities of the nurses and nutrition therapists. The closing part of the theoretical work concentrates on nutritional care and nutritional screening options. The practical part contains the results of the qualitative research. First, an objective was set, which focused on finding out about the cooperation between the nurses and the nutrition therapist within one multidisciplinary team. The objective was established six research questions. The semi-structured type of interview was used for the research. 20 respondents took part in the research, 10 nurses from the departments of dermatovenerology, gastroenterology, surgery, neurology, <b>carcinology</b> and 10 nutrition therapists from the Všeobecná fakultní nemocnice v Praze (General TeachingHospital in Prague). During cooperation, the nurses should focus on the hospital diet system, on the diet types, how to order meals through the hospital information system. They should also learn about the options and news in nutrition therapy at workshops and courses. The nutrition therapists should give the nurses more information about the news in nutrition care and subsequently consult it with them.
