The ion flux, equivalent to an electric current, results from a salinity gradient, induced by two salt solutions at significantly different concentrations. Such equivalent electric current in combination with the corresponding electrochemical potential difference across the membrane, equivalent to an electric potential, results in a battery equivalency. While having a co-current fluid flow of both solutions in the reverse electrodialysis <b>cell</b> <b>pair</b> compartments, a mathematical model needs to be based on both diffusion and convective mass transport equations in the compartments and on the, electromigration-based, ion transport through the membranes.

Isolating {{the function}} of any particular component of this cell–cell communication is often difficult, given the vast complexity of communication networks in multicellular systems.

40|$|Perisomatic {{inhibition}} originates {{from three}} types of GABAergic interneurons in cortical structures, including parvalbumin-containing fast-spiking basket cells (FSBCs) and axo-axonic cells (AACs), as well as cholecystokinin-expressing regular-spiking basket cells (RSBCs). These interneurons may have significant impact in various cognitive processes, and are subjects of cholinergic modulation. However, it is largely unknown how cholinergic receptor activation modulates the function of perisomatic inhibitory cells. Therefore, we performed paired recordings from anatomically identified perisomatic interneurons and pyramidal cells in the CA 3 region of the mouse hippocampus. We determined the basic properties of unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) and found that they differed among cell types, e. g. GABA released from axon endings of AACs evoked uIPSCs with the largest amplitude and with the longest decay measured at room temperature. RSBCs could also release GABA asynchronously, {{the magnitude of the}} release increasing with the discharge frequency of the presynaptic interneuron. Cholinergic receptor activation by carbachol significantly decreased the uIPSC amplitude in all {{three types of}} <b>cell</b> <b>pairs,</b> but to different extents. M 2 -type muscarinic receptors were responsible for the reduction in uIPSC amplitudes in FSBC– and AAC–pyramidal <b>cell</b> <b>pairs,</b> while an antagonist of CB 1 cannabinoid receptors recovered the suppression in RSBC–pyramidal <b>cell</b> <b>pairs.</b> In addition, carbachol suppressed or even eliminated the short-term depression of uIPSCs in FSBC– and AAC–pyramidal <b>cell</b> <b>pairs</b> in a frequency-dependent manner.

How does a cell orient toward a partner, especially {{when faced with}} multiple choices? Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe P and M cells, which respectively express P and M factor pheromones [1, 2], pair during the mating process induced by nitrogen starvation. Engagement of pheromone receptors Map 3 and Mam 2 [3, 4] with their cognate pheromone ligands leads to activation of the Gα protein Gpa 1 to signal sexual differentiation [3, 5, 6]. Prior to <b>cell</b> <b>pairing,</b> the Cdc 42 GTPase, a central regulator of cell polarization, forms dynamic zones of activity at the cell periphery at distinct locations over time [7]. Here we show that Cdc 42 -GTP polarization sites contain the M factor transporter Mam 1, the general secretion machinery, which underlies P factor secretion, and Gpa 1, suggesting that these are sub-cellular zones of pheromone secretion and signaling. Zone lifetimes scale with pheromone concentration. Computational simulations of pair formation through a fluctuating zone show {{that the combination of}} local pheromone release and sensing, short pheromone decay length, and pheromone-dependent zone stabilization leads to efficient pair formation.
