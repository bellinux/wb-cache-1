5|$|Assessing Valencia's hitting during 2010 spring training, Twins manager Ron Gardenhire said: “I {{guarantee}} you one thing, he <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> a fastball; {{and if he}} sits on a breaking ball, he <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> that, too.” On June 3, Valencia was called up to replace Michael Cuddyer, who had {{been placed on the}} bereavement list following the death of his father-in-law. In his debut that day, he went 1 for 3.|$|E

5|$|Samaras {{has been}} {{described}} as having all the skills necessary for forward play. His height, , makes him difficult to handle in the air – and he is also a good header of the ball. This means he can be used as an effective target man and his team <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> long balls up to him. He can also score from corners and crosses. Samaras is also strong which further adds to his physical presence and makes him harder for defenders to play against.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; {{researchers found that}} when it is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{occur when}} the player {{character}} encounters an enemy while traversing the world. Combat takes place in real-time, and in the location the player found the enemy rather than a separate battle screen. The main character can equip a variety of weapons, armors, and accessories. Weapons let the player perform abilities in combat. Referred to as Special Techs, these abilities are powerful attacks by the main characters and support characters {{that can be used}} when the special move meter is full. This meter fills as the player damages enemies. Each weapon, such as a sword or spear, has a set number of special attacks to learn, which <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> single or multiple targets and can be assigned to different buttons on the controller.|$|E
5|$|In a later scene, Marcus {{encounters}} Sal. Marcus {{wants to}} apologize for his misbehavior, and chases Sal when he flees. Sal runs onto a street right ahead of an oncoming truck. Before the truck <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> Sal, the laughing man kicks Sal out of the way, sacrificing his own life for Sal's. Miranda finds the fourth note in Richard's shoe and learns that the laughing man came from the future to save Sal's life. The note asks Miranda to prepare a chronicle of recent events and deliver it by hand, {{but she does not}} know who to give it to.|$|E

5|$|To {{perform a}} bicycle kick, the ball must be {{airborne}} {{so that the}} player <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> it while doing a backflip; the ball can either come in the air towards the player, such as from a cross, or the player can flick the ball up into the air. The non-kicking leg should rise first to help propel the body up while the kicking leg makes the jump. While making the leap, the body's back should move rearwards until it {{is parallel to the}} ground. As the body reaches peak height, the kicking leg should snap toward the ball as the non-kicking leg is simultaneously brought down to increase the kick's power. Vision should stay focused on the ball until the foot strikes it. The arms should be used for balance and to diminish the impact from the fall.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{fly around}} the school {{regarding}} the Chamber of Secrets' history. Harry and his friends discover from Cuthbert Binns, the ghostly professor of History of Magic, that it houses a terrible monster and was created {{by one of the}} school’s founders, Salazar Slytherin, after a fundamental disagreement with the other founders (Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, and Rowena Ravenclaw). Slytherin believed that students of non-magical parentage should be refused entry to the school. When a Bludger, one of the balls involved in Quidditch, chases after Harry instead of zigzagging toward any player it <b>can</b> <b>hit,</b> breaking his arm, Dobby returns {{in the middle of the}} night to visit Harry in the hospital wing, revealing that it was he who charmed the Bludger and sealed the gateway at King’s Cross and that the Chamber of Secrets had been opened before. Another attack occurs, this time to a first-year Gryffindor named Colin Creevey who idolises Harry, and the school enters panic mode, setting up a dueling class for the students (led by Lockhart and Potions master/Head of Slytherin House Severus Snape), during which it is revealed that Harry is a 'Parselmouth', meaning he has the rare gift to speak to snakes.|$|E
5|$|Becky tells Steve {{that she}} is {{pregnant}} and he later discovers that Becky has already told Claire and Steve tells his mother, Liz. Unfortunately Becky miscarries twice, although she was unaware of her 2nd pregnancy, and medical tests reveal an abnormality of the womb, meaning she is unable to carry a child full-term, making Becky decide {{that she wants to}} adopt. During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause trouble, making Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again. Unfortunately Becky and Steve are refused the right to adopt because her estranged half-sister Kylie gave a bad reference and the fact that Social Services feel that it is too soon after her miscarriages. She confronts Kylie, but the sisters eventually reconcile and Becky helps Kylie reclaim custody of her son, Max. Becky becomes very attached to Max, whilst Kylie becomes more irresponsible. Kylie announces plans to move to Cyprus with her new boyfriend and Becky begs her to reconsider, so Kylie offers to sell Max to her and Steve for £20,000, which they agree to. On the night of the tram crash, Kylie returns and demands more money, so Becky steals £5,000 from the ruins of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop, to pay Kylie off. Tracy is released from prison and the two start feuding again, particularly after Tracy discovers Max's sale and agrees to keep quiet in exchange for Amy. When Tracy is brutally attacked, Becky is arrested for the incident until Claire admits she was responsible but Becky admits looting Dev's shop, Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) is furious but does not report her. When Liz finds out she makes life hard for Becky. Becky gets drunk and attacks Kylie and forces Liz out of the pub. Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson) offers to buy the Rovers— with the money Becky and Steve decide {{to start a new life}} abroad and steal Amy. Jim's attempts to rob a bank fail and they are forced to cancel their plans. Steve calls Social Services to check on Max and they take him into care. Becky believes Tracy made the call and smashes her front room up with a sledge-hammer. Before she <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> Tracy, Steve confesses. Becky walks out on Steve and goes off the rails once more.|$|E

25|$|While Nadal's shots tend to land {{short of}} the baseline, the {{characteristically}} high bounces his forehands achieve tend to mitigate the advantage an opponent would normally gain from capitalizing on a short ball. Although his forehand is based on heavy topspin, he <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> the ball deep and flat with a more orthodox follow through for clean winners.|$|E

40|$|A ball <b>can</b> be <b>hit</b> faster {{if it is}} {{projected}} without spin but it <b>can</b> be <b>hit</b> farther if it {{is projected}} with backspin. Measurements are {{presented in this paper}} of the tradeoff between speed and spin for a baseball impacting a baseball bat. The results are inconsistent with a collision model in which the ball rolls off the bat and instead imply tangential compliance in the ball, the bat, or both. If the results are extrapolated to the higher speeds that are typical of the game of baseball, they suggest that a curveball <b>can</b> be <b>hit</b> with greater backspin than a fastball, but by an amount that is less than would be the case in the absence of tangential compliance.

25|$|In {{terms of}} tennis {{strategy}} Halep is an aggressive counterpuncher. Her very fit body and athleticism provide her with very good all-court movement and she {{tends to make}} few errors; she also uses this agility to reach the ball earlier because of her wide back swings and sliding. At {{the same time she}} likes to control the rally and <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> very effective cross-court and down-the-line flat shots, generally producing winners.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, {{since the}} batsmen <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> {{the ball with}} greater {{variation}} and different objectives, the field placements are more important and varied. Modern-day coaches and captains have intricate knowledge of the strengths of opposition batsmen, so they try to plug the dominant scoring areas for each batsman. Moreover, since the bowling attack has greater variety in cricket, the field placements required for each type and line of attack also vary greatly.|$|E
25|$|The shot {{tends to}} be used only in the late stages of limited overs matches, due to the {{favourable}} field settings. The region behind the wicket {{tends to be}} more lightly patrolled by fielders at that phase of the game, so the risk-benefit status of the shot is more relatively favourable to the batsman. It is also physically dangerous because an incorrectly deflected or missed ball <b>can</b> <b>hit</b> the batsman in the head.|$|E
