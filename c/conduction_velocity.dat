These parameters were measured before or within the first month of CAPD and every six months thereafter. The changes in nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>velocities</b> were studied using simple linear regression analysis, and calculating the differences of the slopes from zero. Comparison of the mean values of the <b>conduction</b> <b>velocities</b> in non-diabetics at the beginning of CAPD and in age-matched, nonuremic patients showed significantly (p < 0. 001) lower values in all parameters measured.

25|$|Although the {{electrical}} impulses of AF occur {{at a high}} rate, {{most of them do}} not result in a heart beat. A heart beat results when an electrical impulse from the atria passes through the atrioventricular (AV) node to the ventricles and causes them to contract. During AF, if all of the impulses from the atria passed through the AV node, there would be severe ventricular tachycardia, resulting in a severe reduction of cardiac output. This dangerous situation is prevented by the AV node since its limited <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity</b> reduces the rate at which impulses reach the ventricles during AF.|$|E
25|$|Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) is {{the most}} common form of {{hereditary}} neuropathy and can be further subdivided into two types: Type 1: demyelinating, and Type 2: axonal. Measurement of chronaxie and rheobase for these diseased nerves has concluded that electrophysiologically, a patient with demyelinating (Type I) CMT demonstrates slow nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity,</b> frequently accompanied by reduced amplitudes of motor and sensory action potentials; moreover, axonal (Type II) CMT can be attributed to impaired interaction between Schwann cells and axons. Changes in excitability measures are typically universal and vary little between patients, and this is likely due to the diffuse distribution of demyelination, suggesting changed cable properties associated with short internodes.|$|E
25|$|Measurement {{of sensory}} {{conduction}} in distal nerve segments have shown salient defects in diabetic patients, {{suggesting that the}} function of persistent Na+ channels is decreased in diabetics. These experiments have furthermore opened new avenues for preventative drug efficacy. Measurement of chronaxie and rheobase in sural sensory fibers has revealed mild reductions in excitability in diabetics, as evidenced by significant reductions in <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity</b> and chronaxie of sensory fibers with corresponding increases in rheobase. These effects are attributed to the reduced Na+-K+-ATPase activity in axon of diabetic patients, which causes Na+ ions to accumulation intracellularly, {{as well as a}} subsequent a decrease in the transmembrane Na+ gradient.|$|E

30|$|Motor nerve {{conduction}} {{study of}} the median nerve was done recording as usual from abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscle while stimulating the median nerve at wrist and elbow sites. Distal latency, compound muscle action potential (CMAP), and forearm motor <b>conduction</b> <b>velocities</b> were recorded (normative values: distal latency ≤[*] 4.4  ms, CMAP amplitude ≥[*] 4.0  mV, <b>conduction</b> <b>velocities</b> ≥[*] 49  m/s).|$|R
25|$|Increases in vagal {{activities}} to the SA node decreases the firing {{rate of the}} pacemaker cells by decreasing {{the slope of the}} pacemaker potential (phase 4 of the action potential); this decreases heart rate (negative chronotropy). The change in phase 4 slope results from alterations in potassium and calcium currents, as well as the slow-inward sodium current that is thought to be responsible for the pacemaker current (If). By hyperpolarizing the cells, vagal activation increases the cell's threshold for firing, which contributes to the reduction in the firing rate. Similar electrophysiological effects also occur at the AV node; however, in this tissue, these changes are manifested as a reduction in impulse <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity</b> through the AV node (negative dromotropy). In the resting state, there is a large degree of vagal tone on the heart, which is responsible for low resting heart rates.|$|E
25|$|Given its {{conservation}} throughout evolution, {{the action}} potential seems to confer evolutionary advantages. One function of action potentials is rapid, long-range signaling within the organism; the <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity</b> can exceed 110m/s, which is one-third {{the speed of}} sound. For comparison, a hormone molecule carried in the bloodstream moves at roughly 8m/s in large arteries. Part of this function is the tight coordination of mechanical events, such as the contraction of the heart. A second function is the computation associated with its generation. Being an all-or-none signal that does not decay with transmission distance, the action potential has similar advantages to digital electronics. The integration of various dendritic signals at the axon hillock and its thresholding to form a complex train of action potentials is another form of computation, {{one that has been}} exploited biologically to form central pattern generators and mimicked in artificial neural networks.|$|E
25|$|If a {{group of}} neurons engages in {{synchronized}} oscillatory activity, the neural ensemble can be mathematically represented as a single oscillator. Different neural ensembles are coupled through long-range connections and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators at the next spatial scale. Weakly coupled oscillators can generate a range of dynamics including oscillatory activity. Long-range connections between different brain structures, such as the thalamus and the cortex (see thalamocortical oscillation), involve time-delays due to the finite <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity</b> of axons. Because most connections are reciprocal, they form feed-back loops that support oscillatory activity. Oscillations recorded from multiple cortical areas can become synchronized to form large scale brain networks, whose dynamics and functional connectivity can be studied by means of spectral analysis and Granger causality measures. Coherent activity of large-scale brain activity may form dynamic links between brain areas required for the integration of distributed information.|$|E

25|$|Nerve excitability {{examination}} complements conventional nerve conduction {{studies by}} allowing insight into biophysical characteristics of axons, {{as well as}} their ion-channel functioning. The protocol is aimed at providing information about nodal as well as internodal ion channels, and the indices are extremely sensitive to axon membrane potential. These studies have provided insight into conditions characterized by changes in resting potential, such as electrolyte concentration and pH, as well as specific ion-channel and pump function in normal and diseased nerves. Furthermore, software programs enabling the calculation of rheobasic and time constant values from both normal and diseased nerves have recently enabled researchers to pinpoint some important factors for a number of pervasive nerve disorders, many of which involve substantial demyelination (see Clinical Significance). Supraximal electrical stimulation and measurement of <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity</b> and amplitudes of compound motor (CMAP) and sensory (SNAP) responses provide measures of the number and conduction velocities of large myelinated fibers. Additionally, multiple measures of excitability in the TROND protocol permit assessment of ion channels (transient and persistent Na+ channels, slow K+ channels) at nodes of Ranvier by computing stimulus response curves, strength duration time constant (chronaxie), rheobase, and the recovery cycle after passage of an action potential. This is accomplished by applying long polarizing currents to the nerve and measuring the influence of voltage on voltage gated-ion channels beneath myelin.|$|E
25|$|Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an {{antioxidant}} {{that is made}} naturally {{by human}} cells.

Like other antioxidants, it functions by ridding the body of harmful free radicals that can cause damage to tissues and organs. It has {{an important role in the}} Krebs cycle as a coenzyme leading to the production of antioxidants, intracellular glutathione, and nerve-growth factors. Animal research has also uncovered the ability of ALA to improve nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity.</b> Because flavors are perceived by differences in electric potential through specific nerves innervating the tongue, idiopathic dysgeusia may be a form of a neuropathy. ALA has proven to be an effective treatment for burning mouth syndrome spurring studies in its potential to treat dysgeusia. In a study of forty-four patients diagnosed with the disorder, one half was treated with the drug for two months while the other half, the control group, was given a placebo for two months followed by a two-month treatment of ALA. The results reported show that 91% of the group initially treated with ALA reported an improvement in their condition compared to only 36% of the control group. After the control group was treated with ALA, 72% reported an improvement. This study suggests that ALA may be a potential treatment for patients and supports that full double blind randomized studies should be performed.|$|E
2500|$|These {{time and}} length-scales {{can be used}} to {{understand}} the dependence of the <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity</b> on the diameter of the neuron in unmyelinated fibers. For example, the time-scale τ increases with both the membrane resistance rm and capacitance cm. [...] As the capacitance increases, more charge must be transferred to produce a given transmembrane voltage (by the equation Q=CV); as the resistance increases, less charge is transferred per unit time, making the equilibration slower. [...] In similar manner, if the internal resistance per unit length ri is lower in one axon than in another (e.g., because the radius of the former is larger), the spatial decay length λ becomes longer and the <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity</b> of an action potential should increase. If the transmembrane resistance rm is increased, that lowers the average [...] "leakage" [...] current across the membrane, likewise causing λ to become longer, increasing the <b>conduction</b> <b>velocity.</b>|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{can affect}} both the peripheral {{and the central}} nervous system. However, central deficits are documented less well than peripheral deficits. We therefore compared the course of development of neurophysiological changes in the central and peripheral nervous systems in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Sciatic nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>velocities</b> and auditory and visual evoked potentials were measured prior to diabetes induction, and then monthly after diabetes induction for 6 months. In addition, the effect of insulin treatment was examined. Treatment was initiated after a diabetes duration of 6 months and was continued for 3 months. During treatment, evoked potentials and nerve conduction were measured monthly. In a third experiment, <b>conduction</b> <b>velocities</b> in ascending and descending pathways of the spinal cord were examined after 3 and 6 months of diabetes. Impairments of sciatic nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>velocities</b> developed fully during the first 2 - 3 months of diabetes. In contrast, increased latencies of auditory and visual evoked potentials developed only after 3 - 4 months of diabetes, and progressed gradually thereafter. Insulin treatment, initiated 6 months after induction of diabetes, improved both nerve <b>conduction</b> <b>velocities</b> and evoked potential latencies. <b>Conduction</b> <b>velocities</b> in the spinal cord tended to be reduced after 3 months of diabetes and were significantly reduced after 6 months of diabetes.
