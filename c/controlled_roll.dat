50|$|A {{slow roll}} is an {{aerobatic}} maneuver {{in which an}} airplane makes a <b>controlled</b> <b>roll</b> by rotating about its longitudinal axis. It is performed by rolling the aircraft at a constant rate, while manipulating the control surfaces to maintain level flight. The maneuver consists of quickly moving the aileron input to a desired position (usually less than full) and holding it steady while constantly varying the elevator and rudder inputs, counteracting the force of gravity. Due {{to the difficulty of}} maintaining level flight while slowly rolling, the slow roll is often used as an aerobatic training-maneuver, teaching the pilot to coordinate the movements of all three surfaces (elevators, ailerons, and rudder) simultaneously.|$|E

5000|$|Hans U. Farner was an {{innovative}} Swiss aircraft designer whose footlaunched canard ultralight sailplane had briefly reached production in 1966. [...] In November 1974 he filed a patent for a novel control system, particularly suitable for canards. This suggested mounting the canard on a slender tube which slid snugly within a second long forward tube that, {{together with a}} pod containing an engine, pilot and bearing mainplanes, formed the fuselage. Extension of the canard-carrying tube by means of fore and aft control column movement increased the canard's moment arm and increased pitch. The angle of attack of the canard was automatically altered as this happened. Rotating the tube about its long axis by rudder pedal movement turned the canard away from the horizontal and caused yaw, removing {{the need for a}} vertical rudder.

50|$|The {{design of}} the Trident was unusual {{for more than just}} its mixed-propulsion arrangement. Instead of a {{conventional}} ejector seat, the entire nose section in which the pilot was accommodated could be jettisoned. Particular attention had been dedicated to the control system to ensure it would be suitable throughout the transonic and supersonic stages of flight; while conventional ailerons were be used when flown at slow speeds, these would be locked out of use at higher speeds to prevent the formation of shock waves; instead, differential application of the flight control surfaces upon the horizontal surfaces of the tail unit <b>controlled</b> <b>roll</b> instead. All three tail surfaces were all-moving, eliminating the requirement for separate elevators and rudders while preventing control lock-ups during high speeds. The Suitably impressed with the design and its projected performance, SNCASO received a contract to proceed with development. Accordingly, work on the production of a pair of prototypes commenced shortly thereafter.|$|E

Because of coupling between {{pitch and roll}} angles, the snap roll that occurs in a high speed hard turn affects the stability of a submarine {{not only in the}} horizontal plane but also in the vertical plane. Direct roll control was achieved by making use of the fairwater planes in a differentially deflected mode such that they could give counter moment to reduce the snap roll.

The 45 -degree half-cone forebody common to both the small and large probe configurations provides a design which meets all stability and attitude requirements. The uncertainty in the dynamic stability parameter coupled with the possible variability of roll rate due to ablation induced roll torques could, however, result in slight angle of attack divergence in the transonic flight regime. Minimum roll rate requirements on the small probe are passively achieved by a vane mounted on the pressure-temperature sensing arm. The vane was sized to provide minimum dynamic disturbance...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In IT Service Management – {{as it is}} {{proposed}} by the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) – Configuration Management is considered as a vital discipline for effective support of IT service operation, well directed response to incidents, successful planning of changes and <b>controlled</b> <b>roll</b> out of software releases in an IT environment. The Configuration Management Database (CMDB) therefore has {{to serve as a}} comprehensive knowledge base containing information on IT services, hardware, software and much more. The requirements on a CMDB are manifold. Today, various tools from different vendors exist, but none of them may claim for itself to fit every imaginable demand. That is why, in practice, individual CMDB solutions are developed. This paper presents a first move in giving generic, conceptual recommendations for implementing or customizing a CMDB solution, based on the requirements that have to be fulfilled. ...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedRoll angle {{is often a}} limiting factor during high-speed turns and repetitive turning maneuvers. Navy and Coast Guard surface ships are designed for high-speed operation. Sharper turns at higher speeds, and repetitive high-speed turns can increase ship survivability by helping these vessels avoid incoming threats. This is particularly true if the amount and direction of roll during the turn is controlled, since the ship's susceptibility to radar and other sensors may be diminished at certain angles. Sharper turns at higher speeds can also reduce {{the time it takes}} to reach a person in the water, improving the chances for successful rescue. <b>Controlled</b> <b>roll</b> during repetitive sharp turns can make high-speed pursuit safer and more likely to succeed. The objective of this thesis is to study the effects of fin stabilizers on a ship's turning performance. Fin stabilizers, commonly added to a ship design for the sole purpose of minimizing unwanted roll during ordinary operations, are shown to also favorably influence both the magnitude and direction of heel experienced during high speed and repetitive maneuvers. The effects of fin stabilizers on other turn performance characteristics are also examined. A strategy for actively employing fins during maneuvers is proposed.

40|$|Conventional {{roll forming}} {{is limited to}} {{components}} with uniform cross-section; the recently developed flexible roll forming (FRF) process {{can be used to}} form components which vary in both width and depth. It has been suggested that this process can be used to manufacture automotive components from Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS) which has limited tensile elongation and is unsuitable for stamping. In the flexible roll forming process, the pre-cut blank is fed through a set of rolls; some rolls are computer-numerically controlled (CNC) to follow the 3 D contours of the part and hence parts with a variable cross-section can be produced. As with conventional roll forming, the number of forming stations is kept to a minimum, particularly the <b>controlled</b> <b>roll</b> stations, in order to limit tooling costs. This paper introduces a new flexible roll forming technique which can be used to form a complex shape with the minimum tooling requirements. In this method, the pre-cut blank is held between two dies and the whole system moves back and forth past CNC forming rolls. The forming roll changes its angle and position in each pass to incrementally form the part. In this work, the process is simulated using the commercial software package Copra FEA. The distribution of total strain and final part quality are investigated as well as related shape defects observed in the process. Different tooling concepts are used to improve the strain distribution and hence the part quality. The current work presents a new cost-effective flexible roll forming technique and minimizes the number of tool changes...|$|E

40|$|Flexible endoscopy, a {{procedure}} during which an operator pushes a semi-rigid endoscope through a patient’s gastrointestinal tract, {{has been the}} gold-standard screening method for colon cancer screening (colonoscopy) for over 50 years. Owing to the large amounts of tissue stress that result from the need for transmitting a force {{to the tip of}} the endoscope while the device wraps through the bowel, implementing a front-actuated endoscopy system has been a popular area of research [1]. The pursuit of such a concept was accelerated by the advent of ingestible capsule endoscopes, which, since then, have been augmented by researchers to include therapeutic capabilities, modalities for maneuverability, amongst other diagnostic functions [2]. One of the more common approaches investigated has been the use of magnetic fields to apply forces and torques to steer the tip of an endoscope [3]. Recent efforts in magnetic actuation have resulted in the use of robot manipulators with permanent magnets at their end effectors that are used to manipulate endoscopes with embedded permanent magnets. Recently, we implemented closed loop control of a tethered magnetic capsule by using real-time magnetic localization and the linearization of a magnetic wrench applied to the capsule by the actuating magnet [4]. This control was implemented in 2 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) in position (in the horizontal plane) and 2 DoF in orientation (panning and tilting). One DoF in position is lost owing to the tethered capsule being actuated in air and thus lacking a restoring force to counter the high field gradient. The 3 rd orientation DoF is lost owing to the axial symmetry of the permanent magnet in the capsule; this prevents the application of torque in the axial direction and thus <b>controlled</b> <b>roll</b> and introduces a singularity in the capsule’s actuation. Although another dipole could be used to eliminate this singularity, this would complicate both the actuation and localization methods. In this manuscript, we consider the consequences of the embedded magnet (EM) being radially offset {{from the center of the}} capsule while being manipulated by an external actuating magnet (AM). We have developed a tethered capsule endoscope that contains a cylindrical EM (11. 11 mm in length and diameter) with a residual flux density of 1. 48 T that is offset by 1. 85 mm from the center of the capsule; a distance that is less than 10 % of the capsule diameter. Our investigation into the topic results from repeated observation of the capsule’s preference to align such that the internal magnet is closest to the actuating magnet (AM). The AM is a cylindrical magnet (101. 6 mm in length and diameter) with a residual flux density of 1. 48 T that is mounted at the end effector of a 6 DoF manipulator, as seen in Figure 1. In this manuscript, we evaluate the torqueing effects of the presence of this magnet offset with the goal of determining whether the torque effect is negligible, or impacts capsule motion and thus can potentially be used for the benefit of endoscope manipulation. A concept schematic of this effect is shown in Figure 2. A discussion of how to use this torque is beyond the scope of this manuscript. To the authors’ knowledge, the use of such concept in permanent-magnet based control has not been investigated...|$|E
