40|$|A {{constitutive}} model {{based on the}} Johnson–Cook material model and the extended Drucker–Prager strength criterion was implemented in LS-DYNA to simulate the rock failure process induced by a single disk cutter of a tunnel boring machine. The normal, rolling, and side forces were determined by numerical tests. The simulation {{results showed that the}} normal and rolling forces increased with increasing penetration while the side force changed little. The normal force also increased under the conditions of confining pressures. The damage region of rock and cutting forces were also obtained by simulation of two disk cutters acting in tandem with different cutting spacings. The optimum ratio of cutter spacing to penetration depth determined from numerical modeling agrees well with that obtained by linear cutting machine tests. The average normal and rolling forces acting on the first cutter are slightly greater than those acting on the second when the <b>cutting</b> <b>disk</b> spacing is relatively small. The numerical modeling was verified to accurately capture the fragmentation of rock induced by disk cutter...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : It is {{difficult}} to bend NiTi wire because of its shape memory properties. Although prefabricated NiTi archwires, such as the Connecticut Intrusion Arch or utility archwire are available, there is no simple, economic method available to incorporate first or second order bends in NiTi wires. Similarly there is no simple, economic and reliable method available to place stops in NiTi archwires. A simple creative method of using sterile disposable surgical needle segments as archwire stops (Makhija, Abhishek, Kamna or MAK stops) and archwire bends (MAK bends) is demonstrated. These may be adapted as custom stops and bends in NiTi archwires for fabricating intrusion, extrusion, expansion and distalization archwires. Materials and methods: Fresh unused, sterile, disposable, 18 to 23 gauge surgical needles are segmented using a diamond <b>cutting</b> <b>disk</b> to use as crimpable stops (MAK stops), stops of varying length may also be bent with optical pliers to incorporate bends in NiTi wires (MAK bends). Conclusion: MAK stops and MAK bends are simple, easy and an economical chairside method to incorporate a range of applications which, overcome some of issues with formability of NiTi wires...|$|E

40|$|While the pre-harvest {{sugarcane}} burning is a disused practice, {{green harvest}} requires changes concerning ratoon cultivation {{due to the}} presence of a thick layer of straw. The experiment, conducted in a mechanical green harvesting area cultivated with sugarcane, consisted of two stages: in the first stage, the mechanical straw cutting performance of flat disks with different geometry edges was evaluated, considering two types of disks and 10 replications in a completely randomized design; in the second stage, the effect of soil chiseling on both sides of planting lines, using shanks with straw <b>cutting</b> flat <b>disks,</b> was assessed, as well as fertilizer deposition form. The experimental design in the second stage was completely randomized, with seven treatments and five replications. Treatments consisted of a combination of two straw <b>cutting</b> <b>disks</b> (smooth or toothed edge), chiseling presence or absence, and fertilizer deposition forms (broadcast, on the planting line, and incorporated into chiseling furrows). The toothed disk differed from the smooth one, presenting lower values of horizontal and vertical forces, and torque.

40|$|To {{determine}} the rational order of disk tools placement on the working body {{is necessary to}} know {{the maximum amount of}} rock, destroyed by the disk tool in benching cutting mode depending on the tool geometry parameters, physical and mechanical parameters of rocks. The article contains the definition of rational parameters of <b>cutting</b> <b>disk</b> tools as well as power and energy parameters of the destruction process by cutting disks and by executive body of the coal cutter. The rational geometric parameters of cutting discs are specified. It was found that each step of cutting with a minimum depth of penetration has its own maximum height of bench outcrop. The dependence of the volumes of large items destroyed by the disk tool on the cutting step height was determined. The existence of the cyclic alternation of destruction phases, regardless the fracture parameters, the height of the ledge outcrop, and tools like free cutting geometry were found. In contrast to the free cutting in benching mode of destruction two large fragments of rocks in one cycle were observed. Consequently, the cyclical nature of the destruction process in the benching mode will be characterized by two chips and crushing, and this cycling repeats throughout the destruction process with the same parameters of destruction...|$|E

The general superposition theory using Bueckner’s principle is developed and limitations are discussed.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Localised {{flexural}} vibrations propagating along sharp edges of elastic wedge-like structures are characterised by low propagation velocities (generally {{much lower than}} that of Rayleigh waves), and their elastic energy is concentrated in the area of about one wavelength from the edge. Such localised vibrations, also known as wedge acoustic waves, have been investigated in a number of papers (see, e. g. [1 - 14]) with regard to their possible applications to acoustic non-destructive testing of special engrneering constructrons and for better understanding vibrations of propellers, turbine blades and some civil engineering constructrons. They may be important also for the explanation of many as yet poorly understood phenomena in related fields of structural dynamics, physics, environmental acoustics and may result in many useful practical applications. ln particular, it is expected that ihese waves may {{play an important role in}} the dynamics of wedge-shaped offshore structures (such as piers, dams, wave-breakers, etc.), and in the formation of vibration patterns and resonance frequencies of propellers, turbine blades, <b>disks,</b> <b>cutting</b> tools and airfoils. They may be responsible for specific mechanisms of helicopter noise, wind turbine noise and ship propeller noise. Promising mechanical engineering applications of wedge elastic waves may include measurements of cuttrng edge sharpness, environmentally friendly water pumps and domestic ventilators utilising wave-generated flows. Another possible application earlier suggested by one of the present authors [10] may be the use of wedge waves for in-water propulsion of ships and submarines, the main principle of which being similar to that used in nature by fish of the ray family. lnitially these localised flexural waves have been investigated for wedges in contact with vacuum t 1 - 61. Later on, the existence of localised flexural elastic waves on the edges of wedge-like immersed structures has been predicted [7]. This was followed by the experimental investigations of wedge waves in immersed structures which considered samples made of different materials and having different values of wedge apex angle [8, 9]. Recently, finite element calculations have been carried out [10] for severaltypes of elastic wedges with the of apex angle varying in the range from 20 to 90 degrees. Also, the analytical theory based on geometrical-acoustics approach has been developed for the same range of wedge apex angle [11]. ln the paper [12] deaiing with finite element calculations of the velocities and amplitudes of wedge waves, among other results, calculations have been carried out of the velocities of waves propagating along the edge of a cylindrical wedge-like structure bounded by a circular cylinder and a conical cavity. ln the paper tist different cylindrical and conical wedge-like structures have been investigated using geometrical acoustics approach...|$|R
40|$|Parts {{made from}} fibre {{reinforced}} plastics (FRP) are first laid up on a polystyrene mould. Hence dimensional accuracy {{is dependent on}} the quality of the mould. If the parts are oversize, larger than a metre or so, the moulds must be machined in sections and fitted together. There is therefore substantial advantage in a new machining system that can manufacture the mould as one piece. Currently, moulds are machined on a multi-axis robotic or CNC machine that removes material using a milling cutter. When an observation of the current system was conducted on site, the industrial partner gave permission to use their CNC milling robot for cutting expanded polystyrene. A medium density board was also tested. The cutting forces were recorded. It was found that adapting the same cutting strategy was inefficient. The design of such a machine must be based on a new set of requirements. A number of design factors must be considered. The new machine would be massive and expensive unless three critical issues were resolved at the design stage; cutting approach, instrumentation for control of accuracy, and innovation in the drive. For removing polystyrene, slicing was considered as an alternative to milling. The fundamental operations of slicing are discussed, from simple pushing of the blade to the incorporation of sideways forces and motions. When using a straight blade, the cutting action can be assumed to act along a straight line. For a curved blade, the straight line was replaced by an effective sector curve, measured from an imaginary centre. While a curved blade and a disk blade work with the same principle, the central axis of a disk blade is fixed, thus the effective sector curve is constant. This allows the disk blade to provide constant sideways force uni-directionally. For slicing, the cutting surface has been evaluated by carving polystyrene with a variety of blades. Later, the force required for <b>cutting</b> with a <b>disk</b> blade was analysed. It was confirmed that a higher cutting speed generated higher cutting forces, but for equal feed rates the cutting force was substantially lower than that required for milling. The size of the machine was set at five metres by five in plan and two metres in height. It was necessary to devise a position transducer that could operate over these distances, while giving a resolution of a tenth of a millimetre. A transducer was devised based on the visual interpretation of graduations on a precision tape with markings at two millimetre intervals. The concept was embodied using a self-built line-scan camera. The camera performed scans at one or two millisecond intervals, leading to the choice of two millimetre graduations as a compromise between precision and the risk of aliasing at a speed of up to half a metre per second. A Cartesian gantry configuration was selected as the base platform for the cutting machine. A light weight solution was studied. Traction was provided to each axis using a soft rubber wheel and a pair of DC motors, mounted on the slider. It was possible to combine more than one motor for actuating the slider, if necessitated by heavier loads. In the development of the transducer, a displacement of five metres was achievable with the required placement accuracy. The embedded microcontroller that formed part of the transducer was equipped with an algorithm for precise movement control. Using a nonlinear velocity demand strategy enabled the motion parameters to be optimized. In summary, construction of a full-sized prototype axis has enabled the critical issues to be researched thoroughly. This had created a clear path to the final design. ...|$|R
