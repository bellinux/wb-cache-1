50|$|Following the {{transfer}} of the CPS's responsibilities to the RCMP in 1932, the number of personnel was reduced and some former CPS vessels were discarded. Margaret was among the CPS vessels sold later that year {{as a result of these}} cutbacks, and was acquired by the Brazilian state of São Paulo, which named her Ruth, during the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932. Confiscated by the Brazilian government, she was renamed Rio Branco and was converted to a hydrographic survey ship for the Brazilian Navy in 1934. After serving as a <b>coastal</b> <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> in the Second World War, Rio Branco returned to hydrographic work and was discarded in 1957 or 1958.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of Captains were {{converted}} to act as headquarters ships during Operation Neptune (the Normandy landings) and as coastal forces control frigates. Captains who operated with Coastal Forces (motor torpedo boats, motor gun boats and US Navy PT boats) sank at least two two-man submarines, and {{were involved in the}} destruction of at least 26 E-boats, one KFK patrol <b>vessel</b> (<b>coastal</b> <b>escort</b> <b>vessels</b> constructed so as to resemble a fishing-vessel), two minesweepers, and the shooting down of a Junkers Ju 88 aeroplane.|$|R
50|$|In February 1917, the British Admiralty {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of 36 naval trawlers from Canadian shipyards {{as part of a}} building programme intended to improve the state of seaward defence in Canadian waters. Named TR 14, the vessel was ordered from Thor Iron Works of Toronto, Ontario and was launched on 10 June 1918. The trawler was then sent up the Saint Lawrence River to Quebec City to be completed and commissioned. The trawler was intended for minesweeping duties, but was also used as a patrol and <b>coastal</b> convoy <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> along the shipping lanes on the East Coast of Canada.|$|R
30|$|A more {{realistic}} {{variation of the}} base case assumes that an <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is employed for the 30 [*]days. The cost of the <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is shared between 3 platforms at a daily cost of $ 25, 000 for a total cost of $ 0.25 million per platform. We assume that 10 % of the time, the <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is able to stop a floating ice threat from moving from one threat level to the next higher level. When the <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is present, the middle circle is breached only 4 %*(0.9) 2 [*]=[*] 3.24 %[*]=[*]of the time, and the inner circle is breached just (0.9) 3 x 1 %[*]=[*] 0.729 % of the time. So the expected loss due to ice decreases to $ 5.6 million. As the <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> costs $ 250, 000, the total expected loss with <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is $ 5.85 million. This represents a savings of $ 1.55 million relative to the original base case, suggesting that with the crude assumptions employed here, an <b>escort</b> <b>vessel</b> is well worth the money {{even in the absence}} of EP.|$|R
