40|$|Some {{projects}} of SRF guns apply the design where the cathode {{can be easily}} and quickly removed. One of the disadvantages of this design is the RF power leakage from the accelerating gun cavity cells to the cathode housing that result in the excessive cathode heating. To minimize the RF power leak different kinds of choke filters are used to protect the cathode structure. These choke filters represent resonant circuits with zero input impedance and installed {{at the entrance of}} the cathode structure that shunt the cathode housing. Still, since the <b>choke</b> <b>filter</b> frequency shift under working conditions is bigger than its bandwidth a filter tuning during assembly only in the warm stage seems insufficient and requires also fine tuning during operation. To eliminate the problems of the <b>choke</b> <b>filter</b> finetuning and hence ensure its stability during operation, a combination of the resonance choke elements can be implemented.

Ultrafast, 70 GHz bandwidth, λ = 1. 55 μm, photodiodes from u 2 t Photonics AG have {{been incorporated into}} three designs of mm-wave waveguide mounts. The photomixers utilise a thin freestanding gold foil, or a gold on dielectric, probe to couple power into the waveguide and to deliver the photodiode bias. The frequency coverage of the designs is from 70 GHz to 300 GHz. A method of rapidly characterizing the frequency response of these photomixers using spontaneous-spontaneous beating of light from an EDFA is described.

25|$|These first {{loudspeakers}} used electromagnets, because large, powerful {{permanent magnets}} were generally not available {{at a reasonable}} price.

However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum. In 1930 Jensen introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight Alnico magnets after World War II.|$|R

40|$|International audiencePower-factor-corrector (PFC) {{converters}} are now {{commonly used}} in low-power supply systems connected to AC networks. In addition to their basic PFC properties, they constitute the best technical solution to directly obtain the compatibility with a large range of AC voltages provided by different distribution networks around the world (typically, from 85 to 265 V rms). It is the main application of these converters. This function is achieved with an additional cost and volume, and this extra price to pay needs to be minimized.

A more common solution where good ripple rejection is required {{is to use a}} reservoir capacitor to reduce the ripple to something manageable and then pass through a voltage regulator circuit.

40|$|Ceramic {{filters are}} used to avoid slag and {{impurities}} in foundry applications. When not properly applied, {{the presence of these}} filters may have a significant influence on mould filling. 3 -D casting simulation has been applied to study the effects of the use of a ceramic filter on the metal flow in a gating system. Instead of using a pressure drop model to represent the behaviour of a fluid metal flow passing through a filter, a real exact filter geometry, which is created by a high resolution CT-scan and a non-destructive imaging technique, in the gating system is applied in the simulation. In this research, nodular cast iron is poured into a block casting. A depressurized gating system is used. After a <b>choke,</b> a <b>filter</b> with different orientations is placed in the system. Mould filling coupled with temperature is simulated. Geometries using different orientations of the filter, and without the filter have been researched. The simulated results show that the filter has no influence on the pouring time of the casting if the choke section is small enough compared to the effective section of the filter. Although the filter has no significant influence on the flow patterns in the block casting itself, the flow patterns in the filter zone are different. When the liquid metal passes a horizontal filter, it will be broken into many small streams and show a shower effect. After the part under the filter is full, the shower effect disappears.

5000|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} EVcort {{was the use of}} sophisticated electronics to extract maximum efficiency from the lead-acid battery pack. All of the electronic components: controller, charger, DC/DC converter and DC/AC inverter, were designed specifically for the EVcort by Shunjiro Ohba, a PhD. electrical engineer at Soleq. The car was built under his supervision using engineless Escorts obtained directly from Ford Motor Company. Unlike other direct current (DC)-based electric vehicles of the period, which used series-wound motors, the EVcort used a separately excited (SepEx) traction motor that was built to order for the car by General Electric. This configuration allowed the inclusion of regenerative braking to maximize driving range, but required a particularly complex controller to regulate the armature and field independently. [...] The controller {{was the size of a}} suitcase and incorporated over 300 transistors. The power circuit for the armature used 120 bipolar transistors wired in parallel, giving a maximum 400 amps or 40 kWatts of traction, with another 60 bipolar transistors for regenerative braking of up to 200 amps. By automatically weakening the field current in response to armature current at high RPM, the controller maintained high motor torque over a wide range of motor speeds, allowing the car to accelerate from a standing start to 45 mph without shifting gears. [...] It operated at a relatively low pulse-width modulation (PWM) frequency of 800 Hz, thus requiring large capacitors and <b>chokes</b> to <b>filter</b> the ripple. The traction pack consisted of eighteen 6‑volt lead-acid batteries for a total of 108 volts. Initially, standard flooded golf cart batteries were used, replaced in later models by Sonnenshein gel cells. The EVcort was a highway-capable vehicle with a top speed of approximately 70 mph.|$|R
40|$|In negative-feedback {{amplifier}} design, electromagnetic interference (EMI) behavior is usually completely disregarded. EMI can, e. g., result in detection of low-frequency envelope {{variations of the}} usually high-frequency interfering signals. If the detected signals {{end up in the}} pass band of the {{negative-feedback amplifier}}, they cannot be distinguished from the intended signal any longer, so the signal-to-error ratio (SER) is reduced. Several measures can be taken to prevent unacceptable reduction of the SER, like applying <b>filters,</b> <b>chokes,</b> etc. In this paper, however, circuit design aspects are investigated. It is assumed that interference reaches the amplifier input and that the SER has to be assured by a proper design of the negative-feedback amplifier. Since EMI is related to nonlinear distortion, it {{is a function of the}} loop gain of the negative-feedback amplifier. For a given electromagnetic (EM) environment it is therefore possible to calculate the minimum loop gain required to reduce EMI to acceptable levels without filtering.
