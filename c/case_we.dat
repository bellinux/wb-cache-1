Before the dancing, our {{problems}} were really heavy to bear. Dancing takes our minds away from our problems. Our bodies became more healthy.

25|$|Proof. Consider a graph on t {{vertices}} and colour {{its edges}} with c colours. Now 'go colour-blind' and pretend that c−1 and c {{are the same}} colour. Thus the graph is now (c−1)-coloured. By the inductive hypothesis, it contains either a Kni mono-chromatically coloured with colour i for some 1 ≤ i ≤ c−2 or a K'R(n'c − 1, n'c)-coloured in the 'blurred colour'. In the former <b>case</b> <b>we</b> are finished. In the latter <b>case,</b> <b>we</b> recover our sight again and see from the definition of R(n'c−1, n'c) we must have either a (c−1)-monochrome K'n'c−1 or a c-monochrome K'n'c. In either case the proof is complete.|$|E

25|$|Whether Adam is the personage that {{we should}} {{consider}} Our Heavenly Father, or not, is considerable of a mystery to a good many.

25|$|Ancient authors {{seemed to}} believe, incorrectly, that sling-bullets could {{penetrate}} armour, and that lead projectiles, heated by their {{passage through the}} air, would melt in flight. In the first instance, {{it seems likely that}} the authors were indicating that slings could cause injury through armour by a percussive effect rather than by penetration. In the latter <b>case</b> <b>we</b> may imagine that they were impressed by the degree of deformation suffered by lead sling-bullet after hitting a hard target.|$|E
25|$|Such {{externalities}} are {{a result}} of firms externalising their costs onto a third party in order to reduce their own total cost. As a result of externalising such costs we see that members of society will be negatively affected by such behavior of the firm. In this <b>case,</b> <b>we</b> see that an increased cost of production on society creates a social cost curve that depicts a greater cost than the private cost curve.|$|E

25|$|An optimal {{solution}} need not exist, for two reasons. First, if two constraints are inconsistent, then no feasible solution exists: For instance, the constraints x≥2 and x≤1 cannot be satisfied jointly; in this <b>case,</b> <b>we</b> {{say that the}} LP is infeasible. Second, when the polytope is unbounded {{in the direction of}} the gradient of the objective function (where the gradient of the objective function is the vector of the coefficients of the objective function), then no optimal value is attained.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the problem of}} {{aligning}} individual and organizational goals remains. In addition, in this <b>case,</b> <b>we</b> would also need to consider departmental goals. Also, {{the high level of}} specialization is a barrier for the flexible reallocation of resources within the organization, i.e. people can not perform other tasks than those they are working with in their functional occupation. The most common way of process departmentalization is the division of the firm into business functions, such as purchasing, manufacturing, sales, accounting, etc.|$|E

25|$|The {{specific}} {{functions of}} the ego, {{as determined by the}} relative predominance of sense or intellect, are either {{functions of the}} senses (or organism) or functions of the intellect. The former fall into the two classes of feelings (subjective) and perceptions (objective); the latter, according as the receptive or the spontaneous element predominates, into cognition and volition. In cognition, thought is ontologically oriented to the object; and in volition it is the teleological purpose of thought. In the first <b>case</b> <b>we</b> receive (in our fashion) the object of thought into ourselves. In the latter we plant it out into the world. Both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common methods used for testing {{centrifugal}} compressors is to test along lines of constant shaft speed or along lines of constant throttle. If the shaft speed is held constant, test points are taken along a constant speed line by changing throttle positions. In contrast, if a throttle valve is held constant, test points are established by changing speed (common gas turbine practice). The map shown in Figure 5.2 illustrate {{the most common}} method; lines of constant speed. In this <b>case</b> <b>we</b> see data points connected via straight lines at speeds of 50%, 71%, 87%, and 100% RPM. The first three speed lines have 6 points each while the highest speed line has five.|$|E
