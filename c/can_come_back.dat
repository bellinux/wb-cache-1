They stage a mock quarrel and conduct the rigged {{statutory}} duel as planned: Rudolph's king is beaten by Ludwig's ace, making Ludwig the Grand Duke.

Ludwig uses his new powers {{to extend the}} Act for another hundred years, thus ensuring that neither Rudolph nor Ernest <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to life.|$|E

25|$|Once he is alone, Rudolph {{reads the}} letter and learns about the plot to blow him up. Ludwig arrives, intent on denouncing the plot to him. Before he can do so, Rudolph {{declares}} that he would give anything to avoid being blown up the next day, and Ludwig sees a way out. He feigns patriotism and suggests that the two engage in a statutory duel. He explains that they will hide cards up their sleeves, guaranteeing victory to Ludwig. When the plot unfolds, Ludwig will {{bear the brunt of}} it. The next day, when the Act authorizing statutory duels expires, Rudolph <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to life unharmed. Although Rudolph is sceptical, he accepts Ludwig's proposal.|$|E
25|$|Like many auks, puffins eat both {{fish and}} zooplankton, but feed their chicks {{primarily}} with small marine fish {{several times a}} day. The prey species of the Atlantic puffin include the sandeel, herring and capelin. The puffins are distinct {{in their ability to}} hold several (sometimes over a dozen) small fish at a time, crosswise in their bill, rather than regurgitating swallowed fish. This allows them to take longer foraging trips, since they <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> with more food energy for their chick than a bird that can only carry one fish at a time. This behaviour is made possible by the unique hinging mechanism of their beak, which allows the upper and lower biting edges to meet at any of a number of angles.|$|E

500|$|After a month out of work, Westley rejoined Stevenage on 30 March 2013, {{his third}} spell in charge at the club. On the appointment, Stevenage {{chairman}} Phil Wallace stated [...] "Graham was keen {{to come back}} to Stevenage and, although I met some strong candidates, without doubt I think he’s the best man for the job right now. The club enjoyed a great deal of success before he left last year and we moved forwards significantly in his time here on several levels". On his return, Westley said [...] "I'm really happy to be back, the training ground is fantastic, the club just keeps moving forward. All the facilities keep improving and I hope that I <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and make another positive difference". In his first game back in charge of the club, Stevenage secured a 1–0 victory over Hartlepool United on 1 April. Stevenage ended the 2012–13 campaign in 18th-place, and Westley released four players and transfer-listed three others.|$|E
500|$|On December 21, 2008, LenDale White and Keith Bulluck of the Tennessee Titans {{stepped on}} a Terrible Towel after the Titans's 31–14 victory. Pittsburgh's Larry Foote responded, [...] "They {{deserved}} to do that, they whooped us, they deserve to celebrate and, hopefully, we'll see them again." [...] While Hines Ward said, [...] " [...] did kind {{of the same thing}} and you see where they went." [...] Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher, by this point working for CBS as an analyst on The NFL Today, mentioned on the program that such antics <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to haunt teams. Tennessee was the top seed in the playoffs, however following the incident the Titans proceeded to lose eight consecutive games, including an '08 divisional playoff game and their '09 Week 1 game against the Steelers, 13-10. After the Titans' 8th consecutive loss—a 59-0 blowout to the New England Patriots, the Titans worst loss ever—Titans coach Jeff Fisher expressed regret for his team's behavior towards the Towel, and a number of Titans players autographed a Terrible Towel and mailed it to Allegheny Valley School – the Pittsburgh charity that now owns the trademark. The Titans won their next 5 games.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the cancellation, Anderson was {{required}} {{to come up with an}} idea for another Supermarionation series. He had once been inspired by the thought of creating a live-action police drama in which the hero would have unexpectedly been murdered halfway through the series and replaced by a new lead character. Now giving fresh consideration to this idea, Anderson resolved that a selling point for his new series could be a character that can be killed at the end of each episode and resurrected by the beginning of the next. This, coupled with contemporary theories about the possibility of life on Mars, led to the idea of an interplanetary war raging between Earth and its neighbour and a worldwide security organisation being called on to defend human civilisation. After further thought, Anderson decided that [...] "Scarlet" [...] would make an unusual codename for this organisation's [...] "indestructible" [...] agent who <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to life, while [...] "Blue" [...] could be his partner's designation. From this, Anderson reasoned that all the personnel should have colours for names so as to form the whole [...] "Spectrum" [...] of colours, and decided that someone called [...] "White" [...] should be the leader of the Spectrum Organisation, much in the same way that white light is composed of, and can be broken down into, the colours of the spectrum.|$|E

500|$|In June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he {{believed}} the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for Agent Carter, before airing the remaining 12. Explaining this decision, Bell said, One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something like that. And the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [...] tune in to something else or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and {{there has to be}} a gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's going to be a Marvel special at some point. But pretty much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, Agent Carter comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then we <b>can</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule. It takes out the need for repeats in the back half.|$|E
