5|$|Hours after Humberto made landfall, Rick Perry {{declared}} Galveston, Jefferson, and Orange counties as disaster areas, which allocated {{state resources}} {{to assist the}} affected residents. The governor applied for a presidential disaster declaration on September 21. Four Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teams assessed the hurricane damage in the three most affected counties. Following their assessment, they determined that {{the damage caused by}} Humberto was not significant enough to require a disaster declaration. As such, Governor Rick Perry's request from FEMA was denied. Across the Bolivar Peninsula, an estimated 1,500 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of structural debris and 3,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of tree limbs were needed to be removed {{in the wake of the}} storm.|$|E
5|$|Planning for {{the lake}} began in 1987. The main {{goal was to}} meet Southern California seasonal, drought and {{emergency}} needs. MWD chose the current site because of its geographic location, and began construction planning in 1993. Construction of the lake in 1995 with construction of the three dams. With over 40 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of foundation excavation and 110 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of embankment construction, {{the construction of the}} dams was the largest earthworks project in the United States. The shovels, loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available and established a new standard for earth and rock movement. The two rock processing plants established for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single commercial processing operation in California. Construction of the lake was the largest construction project by the MWD since building the Colorado River Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|Applications {{for federal}} aid {{continued}} through June, with state approvals reaching $54 million on June 3. By this date, the Army Corps of Engineers reported that 964,170 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (737,160 cubic meters), roughly 58%, of the 1.65 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (1.26 million cubic meters) of debris had been removed. Assistance for {{farmers and ranchers}} who suffered severe losses from the tornadoes was also available by June 3. After {{more than a month}} of being open, emergency shelters were set to be closed on June 18. On June 21, an educational road show made by FEMA visited the hardest hit areas in Oklahoma to urge residents to build storm cellars. According to FEMA, more than 9,500 residents applied for federal aid during the allocated period {{in the wake of the}} tornadoes. Most of the applicants lived in Oklahoma and Cleveland counties, 3,800 and 3,757 persons respectively. In all, disaster recovery aid for the tornadoes amounted to roughly $67.8 million by the end of July 2.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{search and}} rescue efforts for {{thirteen}} people who were listed as missing through May 7 were assisted by urban {{search and rescue}} dogs from across the country. Nearly 1,000 members of the Oklahoma National Guard were deployed throughout the affected region. The American Red Cross had set up ten mobile feeding stations by this time and stated that 30 more were en route. On May 8, a disaster recovery center was opened in Moore for individuals recovering from the tornadoes. According to the Army Corps of Engineers, roughly 500,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (382,277 cubic meters) of debris was left behind and would likely take weeks to clear. Within {{the first few days}} of the disaster declaration, relief funds began being sent to families who requested aid. By May 9, roughly $180,000 had been approved by FEMA for disaster housing assistance.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, {{one of the}} sub {{contractors}} of Bouygues fell under criticism for the dumping of tunnel fill on sensitive wetlands on Virginia Key. They {{were supposed to be}} dumping the fill on Virginia Key on the degraded northwest side, but were found dumping it 80 to 100 yards (73.1 to 94.5 m) from the designated spot, where they damaged wetlands and killed about 40 mangrove trees with a piece of equipment that got stuck. The intention was that they would be allowed to put 55,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (42,050.5 m3) of fill there provided that they use it to build a berm to block the view of Virginia Key's sewage water treatment plant. The fill that was dumped on Virginia Key was mainly rock and soil from road construction and site preparation on Watson Island and not from tunnel boring, which environmentalists object being put on Virginia Key as it may not be as clean. The north point of Virginia Key {{is one of the last}} remaining undeveloped areas near the Miami downtown area and has been recently restored as it was previously used as a dumping site for the infill from the Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami Marine Stadium, and Norris Cut.|$|E
5|$|In New York and {{northern}} New Jersey, the storm system left the most coastal damage since the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane. Numerous boats were damaged or destroyed, killing two people off Staten Island. High winds swept a man off a bridge, killing him. High waves flooded {{the beach at}} Coney Island. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, waves washed over a seawall, forcing 200 people to evacuate. Further inland, the Hudson, Passaic, and Hackensack rivers experienced tidal flooding. Outside Massachusetts, damage was heaviest in southern New Jersey, where the cost was estimated at $75 million (1991 USD). Across the area, tide heights reached their highest since the 1944 hurricane, leaving severe coastal and back bay flooding and closing many roads. The storm caused significant beach erosion, with 500,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (382,000 cubic meters) lost in Avalon, as well as $10 million damage to the beach in Cape May. The presence of a dune system mitigated the erosion in some areas. There was damage to the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Fire Island National Seashore was affected, washing away an entire row of waterfront houses in towns like Fair Harbor. Following the storm, there was a moratorium on clamming in the state's bays, due to contaminated waters. Along the Delmarva Peninsula, there was widespread water damage to homes, including ten affected houses in Sandbridge Beach, Virginia. Tides in Ocean City, Maryland, reached a record height of , while elsewhere the tides were similar to the Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962.|$|E
25|$|The cubic inch, {{cubic foot}} and <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> are {{commonly}} used for measuring volume. In addition, there is one group of units for measuring volumes of liquids, and one for measuring volumes of dry material.|$|R

25|$|The {{physical}} {{scale of}} the facility alone made the construction project challenging. By the time the “conventional facility” (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing steel rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent {{of the rest of}} the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.|$|E

25|$|The mining {{has had a}} {{considerable}} environmental impact. In 1920 the Rivers Commission estimated that 300 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of material had been moved by mining activity in the Clutha river catchment. At that time an estimated 40 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> had been washed out to sea with a further 60 million in the river. (The remainder was still on riverbanks). This had resulted in measured aggradation of the river bottom {{of as much as}} 5 metres.|$|E
50|$|A <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> is an Imperial / U.S. {{customary}} (non-SI non-metric) unit of volume, {{used in the}} United States, Canada, and the UK. It {{is defined}} as the volume of a cube with sides of 1 yard (3 feet, 36 inches, 0.9144 meters) in length.|$|R
5000|$|The cubic {{contents}} of the roof and piers were 63,135 yards {{and the amount of}} explosives as follows: rend-rock 9,127 ½ lbs., vulcan powder 11,852 13/16 lbs., dynamite 28,935 ¼ lbs. — total 49,915 9/16 lbs. Being at the rate of 0.79 pound to each <b>cubic</b> <b>yard.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Furthermore, {{access roads}} and site access {{have to be}} able to carry the greater weight of the ready-mix truck plus load. (Green {{concrete}} is approx. 3924 pounds per <b>cubic</b> <b>yard.)</b> This problem can be overcome by utilizing so-called 'mini mix' trucks which use smaller 4m³ capacity mixers able to reach more weight restricted sites.|$|R
25|$|This site {{is being}} {{addressed}} through {{state and local}} funds and is not considered a Superfund clean-up site. The property is contaminated with an undisclosed substance.

25|$|The dam {{will consist}} of a dike of 220 feet high by 1,230 feet wide. It will use 368,000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of {{compressed}} concrete. As of 22 March 2009, 88 percent of the concrete work had been completed. Its scheduled completion date is 2013. The total investment is $375 million USD.|$|E
25|$|The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{initially}} {{estimated that}} the spill released 1.7 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (1.3 million m³) of sludge, which is gray in color. After an aerial survey, the official estimate was more than tripled to 5.4 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (4 millionm³) on December 25, 2008. The spill covered surrounding land with up to six feet (1.8 m) of sludge. The EPA first {{estimated that the}} spill would take {{four to six weeks}} to clean up; however, Chandra Taylor, the staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the cleanup could take months and possibly years. As of June 2009, six months following the spill, only 3% of the spill had been cleaned and is now estimated to cost between $675 and $975 million to clean, according to the TVA.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the most}} heavily {{contaminated}} areas at Cornhusker are the burning grounds with buried and unexploded gravel mines. Their excavation proceeds very slowly, sifting one <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> at a time, because of the explosives' shock sensitivity. Excavation is expected to finish by January 2015, followed by environmental testing, estimated to take 24 to 36 months.|$|R
25|$|Other {{than the}} cubic inch, cubic foot and <b>cubic</b> <b>yard,</b> these units are {{differently}} sized from the {{units in the}} imperial system, although {{the names of the}} units are similar. Also, while the U.S. has separate systems for measuring the volumes of liquids and dry material, the imperial system has one set of units for both.|$|R
25|$|Thus in 1904, the United States {{purchased}} the French equipment and excavations, including the Panama Railroad, for US$40 million, of which $30 million related to excavations completed, {{primarily in the}} Gaillard Cut (then called the Culebra Cut), valued at about $1.00 per <b>cubic</b> <b>yard.</b> The United States also paid the new country of Panama $10 million and a $250,000 payment each following year.|$|R
25|$|The new Memorial Tunnel bypass cost $35 {{million and}} {{required}} years of work. Ten million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of earth were removed {{and used as}} fill with drainage tiles for Paint Creek. 300,000 tons of coal were extracted. The Bender Bridge was demolished. The former Memorial Tunnel was used for storage until the mid-1990s, when it became a testing center for tunnel-fire suppression for Boston's Big Dig project.|$|E
25|$|By May 5, 2005, {{the highest}} point on the new dome was 7,675feet (2,339m), 688feet (210m) below {{the highest point}} of the volcano. It {{contained}} approximately 58 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (45 million cubic meters) of material. Growth of the new dome continued steadily, and small earthquakes continued to be observed every few minutes. The whaleback feature disintegrated steadily but continued to be extruded as solidified lava pushed upward from below.|$|E
25|$|Due to the 150 foot {{water depth}} of the narrows, the Tower Pedestals are each {{the size of a}} 20-story office building, with an overall size of 130 x 80 x 225 feet, on which rest the 510 foot towers.

5000|$|Gravel [...] is a loose {{aggregation}} of rock fragments. Gravel {{is classified}} by {{particle size range}} and includes size classes from granule- to boulder-sized fragments. In the Udden-Wentworth scale gravel is categorized into granular gravel (2 to 4 mm) and pebble gravel (4 to 64 mm). One cubic metre of gravel typically weighs about 1,800 kg (or a <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> weighs about 3,000 pounds).|$|R
25|$|Construction of {{the bridge}} took place from October 1920 to February 1921. The span is 503ft., with a height of 71ft. in the center; the steel weighs 2,000 tons, and rests on two {{concrete}} piers, each 50ft. high and 70 x 40ft. in cross-section, and each containing 1,500 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of concrete. The location was chosen, just downstream of a curve, after observing the pattern of ice jams through the preceding three years.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008, the {{collapse}} of an embankment at an impoundment for wet storage of fly ash at the Tennessee Valley Authority's Kingston Fossil Plant caused a major release of 5.4 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of coal fly ash, damaging 3 homes and flowing into the Emory River. Cleanup costs may exceed $1.2 billion. This spill was followed {{a few weeks later}} by a smaller TVA-plant spill in Alabama, which contaminated Widows Creek and the Tennessee River.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Congress {{passed the}} Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA), a measure {{designed}} {{to assist in}} the cleanup of 22 inactive ore-processing sites throughout the southwest. This also included constructing 19 disposal sites for the tailings, which contain a total of 40 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of low-level radioactive material. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that there are 4000 mines with documented uranium production, and another 15,000 locations with uranium occurrences in 14 western states, most found in the Four Corners area and Wyoming.|$|E
50|$|In SI, {{which is}} a {{coherent}} system, the unit of power is the watt which is defined as one joule per second. In the US customary system of measurement, which is non-coherent, the unit of power is the horsepower which is defined as 550 foot-pounds per second (the pound in this context being the pound-force); similarly the gallon is not equal to a <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> (nor is it the cube of any length unit).|$|R
5000|$|All roof-holes, {{excepting}} {{those over}} piers, were treated by this formula. The piers, being very irregular {{in shape and}} size, would have exacted much care and time to have located the holes and proportioned the charges to the exact mathematical requirements in each case.
