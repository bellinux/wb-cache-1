5|$|Fluid models {{describe}} plasmas {{in terms}} of smoothed quantities, like density and averaged velocity around each position (see Plasma parameters). One simple fluid model, magnetohydrodynamics, treats the plasma as a single fluid governed {{by a combination of}} Maxwell's equations and the Navier–Stokes equations. A more general description is the two-fluid plasma picture, where the ions and electrons are described separately. Fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Because fluid models usually describe the plasma {{in terms of}} a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location, they can neither <b>capture</b> <b>velocity</b> space structures like beams or double layers, nor resolve wave-particle effects.|$|E

However, the trapping potential in a magneto-optical trap is small in comparison to thermal energies of atoms and most collisions between trapped atoms and the background gas supply enough energy to the trapped atom to kick {{it out of the}} trap. If the background pressure is too high, atoms are kicked out of the trap faster than they can be loaded, and the trap does not form. This means that the MOT cloud only forms in a vacuum chamber with a background pressure of less than 10 micropascals (10−10 bar).|$|E

More specifically, {{we have used}} a QW made with III-nitride where the width of the barrier region is large relative to the electron mean free path, and we have calculated the electron surface <b>capture</b> <b>velocities</b> by considering an electron flux which is captured into the well region. The process is assisted by the emission of the longitudinal optical phonons as predicted by the hybrid (HB) model. The results of surface <b>capture</b> <b>velocities</b> via the emission of HB phonons are compared to the emission of the dielectric continuum phonons (Zakhleniuk et al 1999 Phys.

In this study, {{the effect of the}} uniform velocity on carbon dioxide (CO 2) shielding arc welding was examined by laboratory experiments. The ventilation system examined in the experiments successfully fulfilled the requirement for open-type push-pull ventilators prescribed in Japanese regulations (ordinances). It was proved that the velocity at any points in the capture zone fell in the range of 50 to 150 % of the average capture zone velocity. Welding defects could be avoided by controlling the flow rate of shielding gas. Unless the <b>capture</b> <b>velocity</b> exceeded a 0. 8 m/ s, the formation of blow-holes in the welded metal could be prevented at the shielding gas flow rate of 20 L/min. If the flow rate was provided at 30 L/min and 40 L/min, blow-holes didn’t form at the <b>capture</b> <b>velocity</b> of 1. 2 m/s and 1. 6 m/s, respectively. At a <b>capture</b> <b>velocity</b> of faster than 0. 3 m/s, the fume concentration at welder’s breathing zone was reduced to a level below the limit values: ACGIH (TLV) and Japan Welding Engineering Society (CLV #).

40|$|Velocity sensing of {{hypervelocity}} particles was {{a significant}} field of interest from the 1960 s to 1970 s. Generically, velocity sensing has been approached by either of two methods: first, detecting direct plasma or light emissions onto a solid surface, or second, performing time-of-flight by film penetration, or by detecting charged particles passing a static electric field. Impact plasma techniques required {{the destruction of the}} particles. Multiple-film penetrations were also destructive, especially for small particles. There is a need for an integrated, reliable, and simple location and velocity sensor compatible to our intact capture underdense medium without contributing additional damage to the captured particle. Since cometary dust, like cosmic dust, is essentially randomly distributed, knowing the time of the dust capture and the location of the capture on the collector permits the identification of the specific dust particle <b>captured.</b> <b>Velocity</b> information helps to determine the trajectory of the dust particle.

40|$|The article {{presents}} a calculation method for determining fluid flow temperature field data and convective heat transfer coefficients using a laser optical measurement procedure. Basis for solving the energy transport (heat) equation are velocity fields obtained by stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements. PIV is a laser optical measurement method for quantitatively <b>capturing</b> <b>velocity</b> fields. Since {{there is no}} intrusive sensor necessary it allows for undisturbed flow measurements. Stereoscopic PIV measures generate grid data with pixel-wise information of all three components of velocity vectors within a single two-dimensional image layer of the flow. The temperature distribution at the domain boundaries is determined punctually (by temperature diodes) and surface-wise by extensive infrared imaging. Energy transport from the boundaries through {{the interior of the}} measurement area is calculated in terms of the inlet flow characteristics. The energy equation of the Navier-Stokes equations defines the fundamentals for the energy transport within the fluid. Its solution using a numerical model results in the temperature distribution of the measurement area. The method is demonstrated for obtaining convective heat transfer coefficients {{in the case of the}} thermal plume of a heated manikin. The procedure is promising since it is possible to get high resolution temperature field data of indoor air flows, as related laser induced fluorescence methods (LIF) are not appropriate indoors as in this case harmful tracers and toxic particles must be used...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether improvements could be made to increase the capture distance of traditional local exhaust ventilation (LEV) hoods by designing a circular slotted-hood. The criterion of success for this study was to achieve increases in <b>capture</b> <b>velocity</b> at an upstream distance equal to the diameter of the hood (11 inches). By increasing <b>capture</b> <b>velocity</b> further from the face, contaminant capture could take place at distances more convenient to the circular slotted-hood operator while maintaining adequate suction. This was to be achieved by the addition of two slots and a flange to a traditional conical hood opening. Three plates were designed to change the geometry of a plain conical hood (slot area: 0. 1334, 0. 0963 and 0. 0694 ft 2). They were tested at different airflow rates (243, 347, 467, 647, 897 cubic feet per minute) for a set number of distances from the hood face using a thermal anemometer. Three-dimensional maps of performance were created for visual comparisons, and t-tests were conducted to analyze performance by comparison of velocity at any point upstream of the hood. Velocity contours illustrated that two of the three designs had greater capture velocities compared to the standalone conical hood, and paired t-tests confirmed the significance (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Each of the new designs failed to significantly increase capture distance further than 11 inches from the hood. However, increased velocities occurred near the hood opening (within 5 inches). These modest improvements for the largest slot design increases operating pressures by approximately 0. 12 ̆ 2 wg @ 250 cfm but 1. 12 ̆ 2 wg @ 650 cfm.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} detailed description of a new thermal lattice Boltzmann model capable of simulating temperature and velocity gradients within micro/nano-channels and vertical cavities in rarefied flow extending to {{the high end of the}} transition flow regime. The lattice Boltzmann method was selected to perform this study due to its applicability to the rarefied conditions expected in such small scale scenarios. An introduction is first included to provide details on the origins and derivation of the lattice Boltzmann method, including the various aspects that are required to successfully perform a simulation, namely boundary conditions, lattice velocity sets, methods to determine relaxation times, and strategies for <b>capturing</b> <b>velocity</b> as well as temperature fields. This is followed by a description of the thermal lattice Boltzmann method used as the basis for this study, as well as the determination of the method used to incorporate effects of walls on the calculation of the relaxation times. The applicability of this method is validated by incorporating two wall-distance functions based on exponential and power law relationships and simulating isothermal as well as thermally-affected cases. Next, a novel wall-distance function is derived to extend the applicability of our thermal lattice Boltzmann model to the entire transition flow regime. The method through which the function is derived is thoroughly described, and the resulting function compared against reference data based on Molecular Dynamics as well as existing functions available in the literature. The resulting function is validated by simulating cases representing conduction as well as convection applications. Finally, the resulting thermal lattice Boltzmann model is utilized to determine the effect of Knudsen number on natural convection within vertical cavities. In order to successfully simulate natural convection cases representing the conduction, asymptotic, and boundary layer regimes, a method to determine the magnitude of the external force due to density gradients is first derived starting from the Boussinesq approximation. The resulting model is first validated by simulating classic natural convection cases in the continuum flow regime. The model is then utilized to simulate natural convection cases in the conduction regime for Kn up to 1. 0, well within the transition flow regime. The results included in this thesis demonstrate that our thermal lattice Boltzmann model can accurately <b>capture</b> the <b>velocity</b> and temperature gradients expected in continuum, slip, and transition flow regimes. Lastly, the contributions of this thesis to the development of lattice Boltzmann models is summarized, as well as potential future research topics...|$|R
