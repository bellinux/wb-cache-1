The methodology of the selection of optimal structure of the tug assistance has been suggested. It is based on the methods of statistical modelling, the queuing theory and the theory of the ship design, as well as algorithms developed by the authors. The method of calculating forces, which act on the ships during their movement to the port berths, and the transfer of these forces to the required total bollard pull of tugs is described. The method for calculating the economic performance of the <b>harbour</b> <b>tugs</b> used in <b>harbour</b> towage is considered. The algorithm {{for the development of the}} order with the determination of the required number of tugs to carry out towing operations in the current hydrometeorological conditions of the port is suggested.

50|$|Point Chebucto is a <b>harbour</b> <b>tug</b> {{that was}} built at the Halifax Shipyard in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada in 1992. She is one of very few <b>harbour</b> <b>tugs</b> that were built at the Halifax Shipyards. She has been aiding ships {{in and out of}} Halifax Harbour and later Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia since she was {{registered}} in January 1993. The tug was built for Eastern Canada Towing Limited, a company that has been around for over 60 years. The tug is named after the point at Chebucto Head, continuing the tradition of Eastern Canada Towing of naming its tugs after points. Eastern Canada Towing took over Foundation Maritime's work in the field of <b>Harbour,</b> <b>Coastal</b> and Deep-Sea tow and salvage. The firm owns and operate a fleet of modern tugs ranging from 1250 HP - 5400 HP. Most tugs are ice strengthened, with several having Ice Class 1 certification. Their head office is also in Halifax.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Method {{of design}} and {{analysis}} of bollard pull <b>harbour</b> <b>tug</b> focuses in its stability and straight movement. Research includes {{a brief review of}} general description of bollard pull <b>harbour</b> <b>tug,</b> tug boat functions, tug boat characteristics, functions, operation modes, requirements for tug boats, stability standard and factor affecting stability, stability requirements, displacement and buoyancy, fundamental {{of design and}} a very last, fundamental of analysis. This research also discuss about the methodology to implement the design and analysis to measure the stability and movement of the tug boat. The purpose of design modelling is to identify the error of the existing design and to redesign to eliminate or reduce errors. The error consists of the hull structure and skeg design. However to redesign the hull and skeg must be done during design stage. For this report, it will discuss only the basis of the design methodology. The analysis of the stability and straight movement of the bollard pull <b>harbour</b> <b>tug</b> are using software analysis. SolidWorks and ANSYS are the proposed analysis software that will implement for this thesis. The analysis of the tug boat is study on static and dynamic analysis that discuss about finite element analysis and hydrodynamic analysis.

He and his closest friend Hank are the only two <b>harbour</b> <b>tugs</b> (tugs that are not yet eligible to work outside harbour boundaries).

He's a kind little tugboat that is always friendly to the other ships in the harbour, with the goal of befriending everyone he meets. His biggest dream is to become an ocean tug and to travel across the sea to different harbours, but before he does, he works as hard as he can to make the Big Harbour the friendliest harbour in the world. That's why he is always there whenever someone needs him.|$|R

40|$|The {{shipping}} {{industry is}} reliant on port authorities for the facilitation of safe entry and {{departure of ships}} at the ports. This role can not be fulfilled without the assistance of <b>harbour</b> <b>tugs</b> which are run by the marine operations section of the Transnet National Ports Authority. The tugs have {{to be safe and}} efficient in the process of pulling and pushing ships around the <b>harbour.</b> <b>Harbour</b> <b>tugs</b> are expensive to acquire and to maintain. The marine operations business has to make appropriate choices of tug propulsion design in order to realise the benefits of the tugs acquired by the ports authority. This can be achieved by analysing the current tugs that the operations are using, which will then serve as valuable information when the time for asset replacement is due. The researcher chose to use the two tug propulsion designs currently used by the Port Elizabeth <b>harbour</b> <b>tugs</b> as a basis for this analysis. The analysis links the three factors of maintenance management, equipment efficiency and equipment safety, to the minimisation of operational costs as perceived by the tug personnel, the pilots and the marine managers. This study seeks to verify the link between these factors and the perceived minimisation of operational costs. Available literature was reviewed and data was collected using a suitably designed questionnaire for this research. This research paper has led to recommendations that should inform the tug acquisition decisions and raise the awareness of the marine employees to relate the factors set out above to minimise operational cost...|$|R
