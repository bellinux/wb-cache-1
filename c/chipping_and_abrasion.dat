40|$|Effects of {{time and}} size on t₁₀, the {{abrasion}} parameter (fineness indicator) using a calibration model for a given ore type is presented. A model for predicting t₁₀ from a small diameter core material for any ore type is also presented. The ores studied are: Ok Tedi 1, Ok Tedi 2, Red Dome, Alcoa, and Broken Hill. Shape factor of the particles that varies with both the particle size and the ore type affects the abrasion characteristics. Abrasion process in a tumbling mill is described by two mechanisms namely (1) chipping, and (2) abrasion, occurring at different rates. The chipping phenomenon depends on the ore and the shape factor. The abrasion phenomenon is independent of t₁₀° (t₁₀° is the ore-specific t₁₀ at 7 x 10 ⁻⁴ kWh/t tumbling test energy) and the shape factor. Abrasion process occurs at a much slower rate compared to the chipping process. Transition between <b>chipping</b> <b>and</b> <b>abrasion</b> occurs approximately after 2 min of tumbling. The long-term rate {{is controlled by the}} abrasion or attrition rather than by the chipping mechanism. 16 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: p. 103 - 116. Comminution is {{the process}} which aims at {{increasing}} the surface area and the resultant liberation of a particular constituent from the mass of a solid. The autogenous mill uses tumbling to effect comminution, but instead of special milling bodies being added, pebbles of the material to be comminuted are used. The autogenous comminution process utilises less than 0, 1 per cent of the energy input. The principal objective of the present work was to analyse autogenous milling behaviour {{in terms of the}} individual comminuting mechanisms and to establish the inter-relationships between the main process variables, namely rock petrography, size distribution of the feed, applied load, relative velocity and environment. In this manner the optimisation of the process and an improvement of its efficiency was sought. In addition the establishment of testing procedures to predict the autogenous milling behaviour of a given type of rock was aimed. In the present work the gold bearing Witwatersrand quartzite was used, although the findings are applicable to other types of rocks. Since fracture phenomena are involved in all comminuting mechanisms of impact-compression, <b>chipping</b> <b>and</b> <b>abrasion,</b> slow compression and Brazilian tests were performed. The grain size and the mineral composition of the rock has been found to have a large influence on the local stresses required for these processes. Indeed the results show that the fragility and therefore ease of comminution increases with increasing grain size of the quartzite. Brazilian tests on drill cores of varying diameters may allow the prediction of the critical size of rock of the mill feed which can survive in a mill of given characteristics...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} work {{focuses on}} attrition of pharmaceutical tablets, {{which is one}} of the problems faced by the pharmaceutical industry during tablet coating operations. The present method used to estimate tablet attrition is the standard USP (United States Pharmacopeia) friability tester. This is merely a “Go or No-Go” test before the coating operation and does not quantify the amount of attrition in a coating process. Modeling tools for predicting the degree of attrition by considering the material properties and process conditions would be helpful to assess attrition during coating processes. The goal of this study is to develop discrete element method (DEM) based models for predicting tablet attrition and to validate them experimentally. ^ Edge <b>chipping</b> <b>and</b> <b>abrasion</b> are identified as the important attrition mechanisms for pharmaceutical tablets. Models have been developed by conducting experiments to measure tablet mass loss due to these attrition mechanisms in terms of measured material properties and loading conditions. Loading conditions were predicted using DEM simulation of tablets in a standard pharmaceutical friability tester and in a simple rotating drum. Since most pharmaceutical tablets are non-spherical, a new class of contact detection algorithms was developed for cylindrical shapes. The contact detection algorithms were verified and validated by analytical and experimental comparisons. By using the combination of DEM simulations, material property measurements and the attrition sub-models, predictions of tablet attrition are made for friability tests and simple rotating drum tests, and validated with mass loss experiments. Experiments, simulations, and analysis indicate that edge chipping is a much more significant attrition mechanism than surface abrasion for coating operations and friability tests. Mass loss due to edge chipping depends on material parameters such as critical stress intensity factor, hardness and particle size, and, process conditions such as impact velocity. ^ Based on the parametric studies in rotating drum simulations, it was found that the attrition of tablets increases with increasing drum speed but is nearly independent of fill level within the rolling regime. Hence, it is advisable to perform tablet coating at lower speeds with fill levels that maintain the rolling regime to reduce attrition while maintaining acceptable mixing performance. ^ System level models like DEM (to predict process conditions), along with material characterization tests (to measure mechanical properties) can be used to evaluate tablet attrition in a more meaningful way than the current standard friability test. The attrition models can provide information about the effects of various material and process parameters on the attrition of pharmaceutical tablets and can suggest methods for reducing attrition. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} tool wear and geometry response when machinability tests were applied under milling operations on the Super Austenitic Stainless Steel alloy AL- 6 XN. Eight milling trials were executed under two cutting speeds, two feed rates, and two depths of cuts. Cutting edge profile measurements were performed to reveal response of cutting edge geometry to the cutting parameters and wear. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to inspect the cutting edges. Results showed the presence of various types of wear such as adhesion wear <b>and</b> <b>abrasion</b> wear on the tool rake and flank faces. Adhesion wear represents {{the formation of the}} built-up edge, crater wear, <b>and</b> <b>chipping,</b> whereas <b>abrasion</b> wear represents flank wear. The commonly formed wear was crater wear. Therefore, the optimum tool life among the executed cutting trails was identified according to minimum length and depth of the crater wear. The profile measurements showed the formation of new geometries for the worn cutting edges due to adhesion <b>and</b> <b>abrasion</b> wear <b>and</b> the cutting parameters. The formation of the built-up edge was observed on the rake face of the cutting tool. The microstructure of the built-up edge was investigated using SEM.

40|$|A {{representative}} set {{of diamonds}} from the Borrachudo River (114 stones) was described {{for the first}} time as to their physical characteristics, among them weight, morphology, dissolution figures, <b>and</b> <b>abrasion.</b> Most samples are low in weight (~ 51 % less than 0. 30 ct) and only ~ 3. 5 % are above 3. 0 ct. However, considering the total weight, ~ 47 % of it is concentrated in the range above 3 ct. On the other hand, there even occur diamonds with dozen of carats. The most common crystallographic forms are originated from the octahedral form by dissolution, although irregular shapes like <b>chips</b> <b>and</b> flats also occur. The diamonds show differences in form compared to their weight ranges; those up to 0. 30 ct have various shapes; in the range of 0. 31 to 1 ct the most common are octahedral forms and their descendants; and in stones larger than 1 ct <b>chips</b> <b>and</b> flats predominate. The general habitus of the crystals, identified by their final tetrahexahedroid shapes, <b>chips</b> <b>and</b> flats, corroborated by the dissolution figures, indicate that the diamond were submitted to strong dissolution in a magmatic environment. Residual hillocks and holes represent the final stage of dissolution. The study indicates that the abrasion by the fluvial transport was not expressive enough to cause mechanical wear, thus ca. 97 % shows no sign of wear.

Expanded mountain ice, forming extensive to thin Valley glaciers with thicknesses of 500 m & 200 m, produces a range of fractures <b>and</b> <b>abrasion</b> features on quartz clasts as well as pounding, thinning and flattening of gold. On quartz grains these microtextures include conchoidal and subparallel linear fractures covering 10 - 40 % of grain surfaces, minor Crater and v-shaped percussion cracks, <b>and</b> <b>abrasion</b> features. Deep furrows and crescentic gouges often observed on quartz grains emplaced by continental glaciers with thicknesses of> 800 m, are conspicuously absent on quartz grains deposited by thin cirque glaciers (~ 2 0 0 m).
