Based on stomach <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> over 19,500 fin whales {{caught by the}} Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58°N), their main prey species were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis). Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific saury, Cololabis saira; and Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|E

40|$|MEDIA INFLUENCE ON BEHAVIOUR OF OLDER SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN This {{bachelor}} work {{is concerning}} with the topic Media influence on behaviour of older school-aged children". The topic of media influence is currently {{one of the}} very often discussed topics in public. People discuss this influence on children mainly in the negative association with agressivness, violence or negative sexual motivation. Rarely the positive influence as providing information, an opportunity for relaxing or providing amusement in the leisure time is mentioned. The aim of this work was to describe character of the leisure time of children at the age of 11 to 15 and the media influence that children perceive on themselves and on their school-mates and friends as well. There was also the <b>contents</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> the television broadcast completed that should validate the hypothesis saying that there are violent and sexual scenes shown on television in the time period 14. 00 [...] 22. 00. The first section describes the present situation of mass media and their ways of influencing their watchers. There are also specific features of childrens´ watching in comparison to the adults and the main positive and negative factors in television broadcast that could influence or threaten children and their psychical development. In the next three chapters the research including hypotheses, aims and the methodology of work is described. Results of the research among children and pedagogues are showed there in the graphical form and the review <b>of</b> the <b>contents</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> television broadcast can be also found there.

In the latter case, messages of self-identification in Japan, while becoming more locally profuse and variegated, have also become exogenously-homogeneous—insofar as their self-orientation appears more similar to ad messages from the West.

To Kosaka, Holden's study was further evidence that Japanese society had evolved from its original collectivistic values to more individualistic values.|$|E
