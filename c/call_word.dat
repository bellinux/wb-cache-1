We illustrate {{the shape of the}} distirbution and observe variation with genre and target audience. We present a study of the relationship between quality of writing and word association profiles. For a set of essays written by college graduates on a number of general topics, we show that the higher scoring essays tend to have higher percentages of both highly associated and dis-associated pairs, and lower percentages of mildly associated pairs of words. Finally, we use word association profiles to improve a system for automated scoring of essays. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a system, which we <b>call</b> <b>word</b> compansion, {{which is designed}} to enhance the communication rate of a disabled individual who is using a spelling technique to enter his/her desired message. The system saves the user keystrokes by allowing the input of individual words to be in abbreviated form. This work is novel in that the abbreviations are not decided in advance, but are dynamically created by the user at input time. Introduction Up until now, abbreviation expansion has been the method used by systems which allow abbreviated word input from the user. Abbreviation expansion is a technique that allows the user the ability to input to the system a sequence of letters (that do not correspond to a word) as an abbreviation for a word or phrase [4]. Letter sequences are typically delimited with spaces. The system performs a lookup to a table containing the abbreviation and its true word or phrase representation (expansion). If an expansion is returned, it is substit [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of the}} Semantic Web is {{to create}} a new form of Web content {{meaningful}} to computers. The Semantic Web aims to provide greater functionality, via intelligent tools such as information extractors, brokers, reasoning services or question answering systems. Semantics can be addressed at several levels. In this paper, we focus on the lowest level - word semantics on which other higher levels such as concept, paragraph, or document levels can be based upon. This model, which we <b>call</b> <b>Word</b> Semantics (WS), does not include the rich set of tags proposed by the XML/RDF standards. Nevertheless, this simpler WS format comes with a big advantage: it is possible with existing technologies and resources. Practically, this new model relies on understanding word meanings, identifying important named entities such as person, organization and others, and linking all this information via an external general purpose ontology, namely WordNet. With these features, we regard the WS model as a short but strong step toward the long term goal of a Semantic Web...|$|E
40|$|A monoid M {{generated}} by a set S of symbols {{can be described as}} the set of equivalence classes of finite words in S under some relations that specify when some contiguous sequence of symbols can be replaced by another. If a,b∈ S, a relation of the form ab=ba {{is said to be a}} commutation relation. Words that are equivalent using only a sequence of commutation relations are said to be in the same commutation class. We introduce certain partially ordered sets that we <b>call</b> <b>word</b> posets that capture the structure of commutation classes in monoids. The isomorphism classes of word posets are seen to be in bijective correspondence with the commutation classes, and we show that the linear extensions of the word poset correspond bijectively to the words in the commutation class, using which we demonstrate that enumerating the words in commutation classes of monoids is #P-complete. We then apply the word posets to Coxeter groups. We show that the problem of enumerating the reduced words of elements of Coxeter groups is #P-complete. We also demonstrate a method for finding the word posets for commutation classes of reduced words of an element, then use this to find a recursive formula for the number of commutation classes of reduced words...|$|E
40|$|Text {{detection}} {{in video}} frames plays {{a vital role}} in enhancing the performance of information extraction systems because the text in video frames helps in indexing and retrieving video efficiently and accurately. This paper presents a new method for arbitrarily-oriented text detection in video, based on dominant text pixel selection, text representatives and region growing. The method uses gradient pixel direction and magnitude corresponding to Sobel edge pixels of the input frame to obtain dominant text pixels. Edge components in the Sobel edge map corresponding to dominant text pixels are then extracted and we call them text representatives. We eliminate broken segments of each text representatives to get candidate text representatives. Then the perimeter of candidate text representatives grows along the text direction in the Sobel edge map to group the neighboring text components which we <b>call</b> <b>word</b> patches. The word patches are used for finding the direction of text lines and then the word patches are expanded in the same direction in the Sobel edge map to group the neighboring word patches and to restore missing text information. This results in extraction of arbitrarily-oriented text from the video frame. To evaluate the method, we considered arbitrarily-oriented data, non-horizontal data, horizontal data, Hua's data and ICDAR- 2003 competition data (Camera images). The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing method in terms of recall and f-measure. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. How {{long can}} a word be that avoids the unavoidable? Word W {{encounters}} word V provided {{there is a}} homomorphism φ defined by mapping letters to nonempty words such that φ(V) is a subword of W. Otherwise, W is said to avoid V. If, on any arbitrary finite alphabet, there are finitely many words that avoid V, then we say V is unavoidable. Zimin (1982) proved that every unavoidable word is encountered by some word Zn, defined by: Z 1 = x 1 and Zn+ 1 = Znxn+ 1 Zn. Here we explore bounds on how long words can be and still avoid the unavoidable Zimin words. In 1929, Frank Ramsey proved that, for any fixed r, n, µ ∈ Z+, every sufficiently large set Γ with its r-subsets partitioned into µ classes is guar-anteed to have a subset ∆n ⊆ Γ such that all the r-subsets of ∆n {{are in the same}} class [3]. This was the advent of a major branch of combinatorics that became known as Ramsey theory. Often applied to graph theoretic structures, Ramsey theory looks at how large a random structure must be to guarantee that a given substructure exists or a given property is satisfied. Here we apply this paradigm to an existence result from the combinatorics of words. Definition 0. 1. A q-ary word is a string of characters, at most q of them distinct. Over a fixed q-letter alphabet, the set of all finite words forms a semi-group with concatenation as the binary operation (written multiplicatively) and the empty word ε as the identity element. We also have a binary sub-word relation ≤ where V ≤W when W = UV U ′ for some words U, V, and U ′. That is, V appears contiguously in W. Definition 0. 2. We <b>call</b> <b>word</b> W an instance of V provided • V = x 0 x 1 · · ·xm− 1 where each xi is a letter; • W = A 0 A 1 · · ·Am− 1 with eachAi 6 = ε andAi = Aj whenever xi = xj. Equivalently, W is a V-instance provided there exists some semigroup homomorphism φ such that φ(xi) = Ai 6 = ε for each i. Example 0. 3. W = abbcabbxdc is an instance of V = xyxzy, with φ defined by φ(x) = abb, φ(y) = c, and φ(z) = xd. *University of South Carolina a...|$|E
