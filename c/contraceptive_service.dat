40|$|ABSTRACT 	Most of the {{documented}} {{benefits of}} <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> lack in-depth {{exploration of the}} lived experiences of service users. This study of contraceptive users in the Sidama Zone, Southern Region, Ethiopia; was conducted {{with the aim of}} improving the overall understanding of contraceptive use towards women’s health and empowerment. This knowledge enables alignment of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> provision with the International Conference on Population Development declaration of rights-based approach. 	The study employed a mixed method design. The quantitative aspects include use of a descriptive retrospective approach to generate a five year snapshot contraceptive use from health institutions. Percentages were used to compute the contraceptive prevalence in the last five years. The bulk of the study was a qualitative design using interpretive phenomenology- guided by a Heideggerian approach. Data were collected using key informant interviews, focus group discussions and individual in-depth interviews. Data were analyzed using an interpretive phenomenological analysis with hermeneutic circle approach. Results were presented in broad themes following the study questions. 	The findings of the study indicated that contraceptive use in the study area is steadily improving. In 2008 contraceptive prevalence was twenty- five percent and after five years, it reached forty- two percent. Injectable contraceptive is the leading method, with nearly three-fourth of current users on this method. Recently, every health post offers at least one long acting and two short acting methods. The qualitative finding revealed that women’s experiences regarding the benefits of contraceptive use is encouraging. Women explicated that <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> is an emancipatory and transformative experiences for them as it enabled them to control their bodies, reproduction and fertility by averting unwanted pregnancy thereby engaging in various socio-economic, religious, and political affairs. Controlled fertility gave them more time to plan their livelihood issues. The study’s title, a participant quote, captures the sentiment well: “we got peace, rest and stability”. The study finding further revealed the unique contributions of the health extension program in improving access and convenience to <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> by removing many cultural, gender, and linguistic barriers. 	The study concludes that <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> pattern has improved greatly in access and coverage; however, the majority of current users are merely on a single method indicating gaps in expanding contraceptive method mix. Women’s experiences about internalizing contraceptive use benefits towards their empowerment and health are encouraging in that they wholeheartedly expressed that the service is emancipatory and transformative. However, there are grey areas from the perspectives of ensuring support from men and dominant community members such as elders. Moreover, there is observed disconnect in conceptualizing and practicing <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> provision from a broader human rights premises among health care workers across the service delivery hierarchy. 	The research recommends the establishment of smooth and functional mechanisms to ensure all stakeholders involved in service provision develop a shared understanding about the human rights rationale and practice while providing <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service.</b> More efforts are needed to ensure sustainable <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> use by removing the existing cultural and gender barriers. Efforts should be amplified to increase men’s involvement in the reproductive services. Further study is recommended to investigate the nature and factors that influence the incorporation of human rights rationale across the health care system...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Postabortion <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> is {{considered}} an effective means in addressing the problem of unsafe abortion; in spite this fact this component {{remains one of the}} weakest parts of postabortion care. In this context, the paper aims to describe the impact of a postabortion <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> intervention among women admitted with complications from unsafe abortions and to explore the women's long-term contraceptive adherence. Methods 392 women having experienced unsafe abortion were identified by an empathetic approach and offered postabortion <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service,</b> which included counselling on HIV and condom use. Questionnaire interviews about contraceptive use were conducted at the time of inclusion and 12 months after the abortion. Additionally, in-depth interviews were performed 6 – 12 months after the abortion. Results Eighty-nine percent of the women accepted postabortion contraception. Follow-up information was obtained 12 months after the abortion among 59 percent of the women. Among these, 79 percent of the married women and 84 percent of the single women stated they were using contraception at 12 months. Condom use among the single women increased significantly during the 12 months follow up. Conclusion Postabortion contraceptive services appear to be well accepted by women who are admitted with complications after an unsafe abortion and should thus be recognized as an important means in addressing the problem of unsafe abortion. In addition, counselling about HIV and condom use should be considered an essential aspect of postabortion care. </p...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} need for, and {{potential}} uptake of, a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> within a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic. METHODS: 544 women, median age 17 years (range 13 - 54) including 142 teenagers, attending the Fife GUM clinics serving a semirural population of 350, 000 {{for the first}} time in the 12 month period from 1 September 1995 to 31 August 1996 were interviewed. RESULTS: Contraception was required by 353, of whom only 5 % (29) were at risk of unplanned pregnancy, although half (15) of these were teenagers. 23 of 29 (79 %) stated that they would access contraception at a GUM clinic if it were available. Of women using contraception, 67 % (217 / 324) were taking the oral contraceptive pill (OCP), of whom 177 obtained supplies from their general practitioners and were happy with this. However, 92 / 177 (52 %) stated that they would access the OCP at GUM clinics if it were available. Overall, of the 243 women who stated that they would access contraception at the GUM clinic, 23 of whom were currently at risk of an unplanned pregnancy, the demand was principally for condoms and the OCP. CONCLUSION: The majority of women attending GUM clinics {{for the first time}} are using contraception, or have deliberately chosen not to do so. Only 5 % were at risk of unplanned pregnancy. In general, the women using contraception were happy with their current source of contraception, but about two thirds would use a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> at GUM clinics if it were available at the time they were attending the clinic. It was found that teenagers accounted for half of those women at risk of unwanted pregnancy.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of population {{policy in the}} Philippines reflects the country’s political history. In the 1970 s, the regime of Ferdinand Marcos (1969 – 86) provided strong support to a national program centered on fertility reduction and contraceptive distri-bution.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the technical dimensions of "quality of care" in <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> delivery {{in both the}} Cyclofem Introductory Trial, {{as well as in}} routine service delivery of other injectables in Indonesia. Although the quality of care in the Cyclofem trial was generally acceptable, substantial weaknesses in screening, clinical technique, the management of side-effects, and knowledge concerning re-injection time frames were identified in the provision of injectable contraceptives in routine service delivery. The findings suggest that in order for Cyclofem and other injectables to be delivered in the routine program with an adequate standard of care, considerable managerial adaptation and strengthening of providers' technical capabilities would be necessary prior to actual introduction. This would include providing training and updated technical guidelines concerning both Cyclofem and other contraceptives to providers, with an emphasis on technical issues including contraceptive indications and contraindications, re-injection timeframes, maintenance of asepsis and the management of side-effects.

Unwanted pregnancy, unsafe induced abortions and associated high morbidity and mortality among young women {{may be attributed to}} low contraceptive use. This study aims at exploring reasons for low contraceptive use {{among young people}}. Methods In 16 focus group discussions, the views of young people about obstacles and enabling factors to contraceptive use in Mityana and Mubende districts, Uganda were explored. The groups were homogeneously composed by married and unmarried men and women, between the ages of 15 - 24. The data obtained was analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results Young men and women described multiple obstacles to contraceptive use. The obstacles were categorized as misconceptions and fears related to contraception, gender power relations, socio-cultural expectations and contradictions, short term planning, and health service barriers. Additionally, young people recounted several enabling factors that included female strategies to overcome obstacles, changing perceptions to contraceptive use, and changing attitude towards a small family size.

40|$|Abstract Background Unintended pregnancies lead to unsafe abortions, {{which are}} {{a leading cause of}} {{preventable}} maternal mortality among young women in Uganda. There is a discrepancy between the desire to prevent pregnancy and actual contraceptive use. Health care providers' perspectives on factors influencing contraceptive use and service provision to young people aged 15 - 24 in two rural districts in Uganda were explored. Methods Semi-structured questionnaires were used for face- to-face interviews with 102 providers of <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> at public, private not-for-profit, and private for-profit health facilities in two rural districts in Uganda. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in the analysis of data. Results Providers identified service delivery, provider-focused, structural, and client-specific factors that influence contraceptive use among young people. Contraceptive use and provision to young people were constrained by sporadic contraceptive stocks, poor service organization, and the limited number of trained personnel, high costs, and unfriendly service. Most providers were not competent enough to provide long-acting methods. There were significant differences in providers' self-rated competence by facility type; private for-profit providers' competence was limited for most contraceptives. Providers had misconceptions about contraceptives, they had negative attitudes towards the provision of contraceptives to young people, and they imposed non-evidence-based age restrictions and consent requirements. Thus, most providers were not prepared or were hesitant to give young people contraceptives. Short-acting methods were, however, considered acceptable for young married women and those with children. Conclusion Provider, client, and health system factors restricted contraceptive provision and use for young people. Their contraceptive use prospects are dependent on provider behavior and health system improvements. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether the effectiveness of contraceptive services for teenagers {{is related to the}} balance of service provision between general practitioners and specialist family planning services. DESIGN [...] Cross sectional study with routinely collected data from family planning clinics and family health services authorities and published data on births and abortions. SETTING [...] Eight health districts in the former Oxford region. SUBJECTS [...] Girls aged under 16 and women aged 16 - 19 who attended a <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> during 1991 - 2 or who gave birth or had an abortion during 1990 - 2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Attenders at family planning clinics as a percentage of all users of contraceptive services. The conception rate:uptake of contraceptive services ratio was used as a measure of effectiveness. RESULTS [...] In comparisons between districts the percentage of all users of contraceptive services who attended a clinic varied from 38 % (95 % confidence interval 28 % to 48 %) to 79 % (72 % to 86 %) among 13 - 15 year olds and from 14 % (12 % to 15 %) to 44 % (42 % to 46 %) among women aged 16 - 19 years. The conception rate: uptake of contraceptive services ratio varied twofold in the older age group and more than threefold in the younger age group. It was lowest in districts where clinic attenders comprised a large percentage of all users of contraceptive services.

40|$|Abstract Background In Burma, severe {{human rights}} violations, civil conflict, and the {{persecution}} of ethnic and linguistic minority populations {{has resulted in the}} displacement of millions of people, many of whom now reside as internally displaced populations (IDPs) in Eastern Burma or in Thailand as refugees or undocumented migrants. Use of the intra-uterine device (IUD), a non-user dependent and highly reliable method of long acting reversible contraception, has the potential to make a significant impact on reproductive health in this protracted conflict setting. Objectives This qualitative study aimed to understand Burmese women’s experiences with and perceptions of the IUD and identify avenues for improving <b>contraceptive</b> <b>service</b> delivery along the Thailand-Burma border. Methods In the summer of 2013, we conducted in-person in-depth open-ended interviews with 31 women who obtained IUDs from a clinic along the border. We conducted a content and thematic analysis of these data using both a priori (pre-determined) and emergent codes and inductive techniques. Results Women’s experiences with the IUD are overwhelmingly positive and the experiences of friends and family impact use of the device. Financial considerations and access to reproductive health facilities also shape the use of the IUD in this region. The IUD is rare along the Thailand-Burma border and misinformation about this method of contraception is pervasive. Conclusion Our findings suggest that this modality of contraception is culturally acceptable and may be able to address structural barriers to reproductive health services along the Thailand-Burma border. Ensuring that information provided by health care providers and among peer groups is evidence-based, a full range of contraceptive methods is available, and adoption of an IUD is affordable are priorities for expanding access to reproductive health services in this setting...|$|E

A purposive sampling method was used to select participants who met the set criteria. Two focus group interviews were held with youth who visited the selected health care centres for contraceptives {{and those who had}} terminated a pregnancy. The interviews were tape recorded, field notes were made during interviews and these were transcribed verbatim. The findings revealed that a number of factors {{play a major role in}} non-utilisation of <b>contraceptives</b> and <b>contraceptive</b> <b>services...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective (s) Many {{adolescents}} {{in developing countries}} have an unmet need for contraception, which can contribute to poor reproductive health outcomes. Recent literature reviews have not adequately captured effective <b>contraceptive</b> <b>services</b> and interventions for {{adolescents in}} low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aims to identify and evaluate the existing evidence base on <b>contraceptive</b> <b>services</b> and interventions for adolescents in LMICs that report an impact on contraceptive behavior outcomes. Study DesignStructured literature review of published and unpublished papers about <b>contraceptive</b> <b>services</b> and interventions for adolescents in LMICs that report an impact on contraceptive behavior outcomes. ResultsWe identify common elements used by programs that measured an impact on adolescent contraceptive behaviors and summarize outcomes from 15 studies that met inclusion criteria. Effective programs generally combined numerous program approaches and addressed both user and service provision issues. Overall, few rigorous {{studies have been conducted}} in LMICs that measure contraceptive behaviors. Few interventions reach the young, the out of school and other vulnerable groups of adolescents. Conclusion (s) Though the evidence base is weak, there are promising foundations for adolescent contraceptive interventions in nearly every region of the world. We offer recommendations for programmers and identify gaps in the evidence base to guide future research...|$|R
