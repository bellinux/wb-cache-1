40|$|Even {{though in}} large cities public {{transportation}} is a valued asset to the community, in smaller cities public transportation is often overlooked. While most <b>college</b> <b>towns</b> have public transportation systems in place, not all have systems that provide adequate service. This paper explores and begins to quantify the benefits of increased investment into public transportation to both the community and students in <b>college</b> <b>towns.</b> US census data shows that public transportation in <b>college</b> <b>towns</b> is utilized by {{a higher proportion of}} residents than the national average, which supports the notion that inferior transportation systems can benefit from additional investment...|$|R

5|$|East Lansing is {{very much}} a <b>college</b> <b>town,</b> with 60.2% of the {{population}} between the ages of 15 and 24. President John A. Hannah's push to expand in the 1950s and 1960s resulted in the largest residence hall system in the United States. Around 16,000 students live in MSU's 23 undergraduate halls, one graduate hall, and three apartment villages. Each residence hall has its own hall government, with representatives in the Residence Halls Association. Yet despite the size and extent of on-campus housing, the residence halls are complemented by a variety of housing options. 58% of students live off-campus, mostly in the areas closest to campus, in either apartment buildings, former single-family homes, fraternity and sorority houses, or in a co-op.|$|E

30|$|Admittedly, this {{definition}} of <b>college</b> <b>towns</b> {{is a fairly}} restrictive one, and a case could be made that many areas not included should be rightfully considered as <b>college</b> <b>towns.</b> The present definition is intended to limit the analysis to areas where {{colleges and universities have}} a relatively large influence. Furthermore, the 41 areas meeting this criterion are also relatively small metropolitan areas having a mean population of 203, 919. Again, it is these smaller areas in which recent graduates may suffer the most from staying in the area where they went to college. Ideally, we might also like to include non-metropolitan <b>college</b> <b>towns,</b> but unfortunately the Census public use microdata do not allow separate identification of geographic areas with populations less than 100, 000. Consequently, the lowest level of identifiable geography, the PUMA, lumps very small areas together with other nearby areas that often span large land masses. This makes it harder to identify whether recent college graduates remain in non-metropolitan <b>college</b> <b>towns</b> because they might still be in the same PUMA but have moved to a new location a considerable distance from where they attended college. These geographic identification problems also affect a few of the metropolitan areas included in this study, though to a lesser extent than would be true for non-metropolitan areas.|$|R
