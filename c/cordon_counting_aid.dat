40|$|In {{spite of}} the 1976 Central Area Plan, the Toronto Central Area still {{maintained}} {{its role as a}} major employment centre, and is likely to stay as the hub of increasing work trips generated throughout the Toronto region in the future. The principal task {{of this study is to}} analyze and measure the effects and impacts of population and housing intensification in the Toronto Central Area on travel demand during the morning peak period associated with this Toronto Central Area for the period 1975 - 90. The findings could prove to be a very valuable tool in managing growth and development in the Central Area. Detailed time series analysis from 1975 to 1989 is performed using the Metro <b>Cordon</b> <b>Count</b> data. A cross-sectional analysis for 1987 was also conducted using the 1987 Travel Diary Survey data. A simple travel demand model for the Central Area is developed to evaluate <b>Cordon</b> <b>Count</b> data...|$|R

40|$|This paper assesses whether two {{sustainability}} policies {{currently in}} effect in London, a congestion charge zone {{and a low}} emission zone, have affected freight operations and reduced vehicle kilometers travelled. It investigates responses by freight operators, including re-timing, re-routing, or {{reducing the number of}} trips, or replacing vehicles. Freight traffic trends from 1994 to 2012 were identified using road traffic estimates, <b>cordon</b> <b>counts,</b> and vehicle speed data and supplemented by interviews with freight industry experts and operators. Findings indicate that freight traffic increased throughout London during this timeframe, but declined in the central boroughs partly within the congestion charge zone. The congestion charge may have time-shifted some light goods trips, but most freight trips face a variety of constraints on operators’ delivery window. No evidence was found of re-routing of freight traffic or avoidance traffic around the charged zone. The low emission zone spurred higher levels of operational change than the congestion charge zone, and it was effective at spurring freight vehicle replacement. The paper also discusses freight operators’ perceptions of these policies and how they could be improved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Parasitaemia, the {{percentage}} of infected erythrocytes, is used to measure progress of experimental Plasmodium infection in infected hosts. The most widely used technique for parasitaemia determination is manual microscopic enumeration of Giemsa-stained blood films. This process is onerous, time consuming and relies on the expertise of the experimenter giving rise to person-to-person variability. Here the development of image-analysis software, named Plasmodium AutoCount, which can automatically generate parasitaemia values from Plasmodium -infected blood smears, is reported. Methods Giemsa-stained blood smear images were captured with a camera attached to a microscope and analysed using a programme written in the Python programming language. The programme design involved foreground detection, cell and infection detection, and spurious hit filtering. A number of parameters were adjusted by a calibration process using a set of representative images. Another programme, <b>Counting</b> <b>Aid,</b> written in Visual Basic, was developed to <b>aid</b> manual <b>counting</b> when the quality of blood smear preparation is too poor for use with the automated programme. Results This programme has been validated for use in estimation of parasitemia in mouse infection by Plasmodium yoelii and used to monitor parasitaemia {{on a daily basis}} for an entire challenge infection. The parasitaemia values determined by Plasmodium AutoCount were shown to be highly correlated with the results obtained by manual counting, and the discrepancy between automated and manual counting results were comparable to those found among manual counts of different experimenters. Conclusions Plasmodium AutoCount {{has proven to be a}} useful tool for rapid and accurate determination of parasitaemia from infected mouse blood. For greater accuracy when smear quality is poor, Plasmodium AutoCount, can be used in conjunction with <b>Counting</b> <b>Aid.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Assessments {{were made}} of the impacts on freight traffic and {{operations}} of two sustainability policies currently in effect in London, a congestion charge zone (CCZ) and a low emissions zone (LEZ). Responses by freight operators, including retiming, rerouting, {{reducing the number of}} trips and kilometers traveled, and replacing vehicles, was investigated. Trends from 1994 to 2012 were identified with the use of road traffic estimates, <b>cordon</b> <b>counts,</b> and vehicle speed data, supplemented by interviews with freight industry experts and operators. In this time frame, goods traffic increased throughout London but declined in the central CCZ. Findings indicate that freight traffic was largely insensitive to the congestion charge. Price elasticity of demand was estimated as −. 04 to −. 06 for light goods vehicles and as perfectly inelastic for medium and heavy goods vehicles in the long run. The congestion charge may have time-shifted some light goods vehicle trips. No evidence was found of rerouting of freight traffic or avoidance traffic around the CCZ. Freight operators likely benefited from travel time reductions and journey reliability improvements throughout Inner London, a wider area than the CCZ. Operational efficiencies may have been achieved through greater vehicle load consolidation but offset by the relocation of logistics depots and warehouses priced out of central London. The LEZ was effective at spurring vehicle replacement, including some substitution to smaller vehicles.

40|$|Conventional {{population}} estimates {{prepared by}} statistical agencies typically {{focus on the}} population resident in a given geographic area at a defined point in time, but in practice many locations undergo substantial daily, weekly and seasonal flux in population numbers. Such fluctuations exert wide-ranging impacts {{for goods and services}} in destination areas, such that increasing recognition is being given to the need for more refined estimates that capture these 2 ̆ 7 service populations 2 ̆ 7. While a number of methods have been proposed to count visitors or estimate temporary populations, systematic testing has been limited, and the evidence suggests that no single methodology is effective at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This paper utilises a hybrid approach which couples <b>cordon</b> <b>counts</b> based on multiple technologies with administrative data and an on-line survey to estimate the daily, weekly and seasonal fluctuation in the population of a large Australian metropolitan University campus. Our results trace {{the rise and fall of}} the campus population over the course of the day, identify the scale and duration of the peak, and show how population numbers vary from day to day and over the course of the teaching semester. We track aggregate flows to and from Campus by mode of travel and find they significantly exceed the on-campus population peak, underlining its sensitivity to timetabling of classes and other events. We also identify strong correlations between data sources which assist in validating the estimates and, together with evolving technologies, offer potential avenues for substantial cost saving in future estimations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of reviewThis review {{will discuss}} methodologies and {{applicability}} of key inflammatory models of respiratory disease in {{proof of concept}} or proof of efficacy clinical studies. In close relationship with these models, induced sputum and inflammatory cell counts will be addressed for phenotype-directed drug development. Additionally, important regulatory aspects regarding noninvestigational medicinal products used in bronchial challenges or clinical inflammatory models of respiratory disease will be highlighted. Recent findingsThe recognition of an ever increasing number of phenotypes and endotypes within conditions such as asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} urges phenotyping of study populations already in early clinical phases of drug development. Apart from the choice of a relevant disease model, recent studies show that especially targeted therapies need to be tested in well defined disease subsets for adequate efficacy assessment. Noninvasive biomarkers, especially sputum inflammatory cell <b>counts,</b> <b>aid</b> phenotyping and are useful outcome measures for novel, targeted therapies.
