40|$|Acommon need in honors {{education}} is to recruit a student cohort that actively engages in educational experiences, demonstrates a motivation for academic challenge, {{and is likely to}} complete the honors program. Honors programs use varied quantitative (Green 2 ̆ 6 Kimbrough) and qualitative admissions criteria to yield this desired student cohort. However, research is limited on the value of quantitative measures, i. e., SAT scores, grade point average, and/or class rank, in predicting qualities such as student engagement or outcomes such as program completion. Attempting to recruit a more diversified student cohort and to increase student engagement, the Clarion University Honors Program initiated a collaborative recruitment model with the athletic program. In addition to the goal of student engagement, this model was designed to be mutually beneficial through <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> <b>recruitment</b> scholarship incentives. From the standpoint of the athletic program, student athletes’ engagement in honors education could positively affect academic performance and consequently graduation rates. From the perspective of the honors program, admission of student athletes could create a more engaged student population within the honors community...|$|E

40|$|During {{skeletal}} remodeling, pre-osteoclasts and pre-osteoblasts {{are targeted}} to critical {{sites of the}} bone to resorb and reconstruct bone matrix, respectively. <b>Coordination</b> <b>of</b> site-specific <b>recruitment</b> <b>of</b> these two cell types is a prerequisite to maintain the specific architecture of each bone within strict limits throughout adult life. Here, we determined that the bone marrow microanatomy adjacent to remodeling areas is a central player in this process. By using histomorphometry and multiple immunostainings, we demonstrated in biopsies exhibiting coupled bone resorption and formation that osteoclasts and osteoblasts on the bone surface were always covered by a canopy of flat cells expressing osteoblast markers. In contrast, in biopsies in which this canopy was disrupted, bone formation was deficient. Three-dimensional visualizations revealed that this canopy covered the entire remodeling site and was associated with capillaries, thereby forming a previously unrecognized microanatomical entity. Furthermore, pre-osteoclasts were positioned along these capillaries. These findings led to a model that implicates vasculature in the site-specific <b>recruitment</b> <b>of</b> osteoclasts and osteoblasts and embraces the current knowledge on the molecular mechanism of bone remodeling...|$|R

The {{primary goal of}} this study was to determine whether the electromyographic (EMG) pattern <b>of</b> muscle <b>recruitment</b> could provide metabolic information on oxidative fuel selection during high-intensity shivering. EMG activity (of 8 large muscles) and fuel metabolism were monitored simultaneously in non-acclimatized adult men during high-intensity shivering. Even though acute cold exposure elicited similar changes in metabolic rate among subjects, lipid and carbohydrate use was very different. Depending on the subject, the cold-induced increase in carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation ranged between 2 - and 8 -fold, with CHO accounting for 33 – 78 % of total heat production (Ḣprod), and lipids for 14 – 60 % Ḣprod. This high variability in fuel selection was primarily explained by differences in ‘burst shivering’ rate, indicating that the <b>recruitment</b> <b>of</b> type II fibres plays a key role in orchestrating fuel selection. This study is the first to show that the pattern <b>of</b> muscle <b>recruitment</b> can provide quantitative information on energy metabolism. Future work should focus on the study of shivering bursts that may provide essential clues on what limits human survival in the cold...|$|R
40|$|AP- 2 is the core-organizing {{element in}} clathrin-mediated endocytosis. During the {{formation}} of clathrin-coated vesicles, clathrin and endocytic accessory proteins interact with AP- 2 in a temporally and spatially controlled manner, yet it remains elusive as to how these interactions are regulated. Here, we demonstrate that the endocytic protein NECAP 1, which binds to the a-ear of AP- 2 through a C-terminal WxxF motif, uses an N-terminal PH-like domain to compete with clathrin {{for access to the}} AP- 2 b 2 -linker, revealing a means to allow AP- 2 –mediated <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> accessory protein <b>recruitment</b> and clathrin polymerization at sites of vesicle formation. Knockdown and functional rescue studies demonstrate that through these interactions, NECAP 1 and AP- 2 cooperate to increase the probability of clathrin-coated vesicle formation and to control the number, size, and cargo content of the vesicles. Together, our data demonstrate that NECAP 1 modulates the AP-...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNipah virus (NiV) is {{a highly}} pathogenic, negative-strand RNA {{paramyxovirus}} that has recently emerged from flying foxes to cause serious human disease. We have analyzed {{the role of the}} nonstructural NiV C protein in viral immunopathogenesis using recombinant virus lacking the expression of NiV C (NiVΔC). While wild-type NiV was highly pathogenic in the hamster animal model, NiVΔC was strongly attenuated. Replication of NiVΔC was followed by the production of NiV-specific antibodies and associated with higher <b>recruitment</b> <b>of</b> inflammatory cells and less intensive histopathological lesions in different organs than in wild-type-NiV-infected animals. To analyze the molecular basis of NiVΔC attenuation, we studied early changes in gene expression in infected primary human endothelial cells, a major cellular target of NiV infection. The transcriptomic approach revealed the striking difference between wild-type and mutant NiV in the expression of genes involved in immunity, with the particularly interesting differential patterns of proinflammatory cytokines. Compared to wild-type virus, NiVΔC induced increased expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 β), IL- 8, CXCL 2, CXCL 3, CXCL 6, CCL 20, and beta interferon. Furthermore, the expression of NiV C in stably transfected cells decreased the production of the same panel of cytokines, revealing a role of the C protein in the regulation of cytokine balance. Together, these results suggest that NiV C regulates expression of proinflammatory cytokines, therefore providing a signal responsible for the <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> leukocyte <b>recruitment</b> and the chemokine-induced immune response and controlling the lethal outcome of the infection...|$|R

More unpaid voluntary work within health care services has been put forward as a solution. Cooperation between volunteers and municipal health authorities can be challenging. This qualitative interview study with seven volunteers and six health care service managers explore experiences with cooperation between third sector and health care services in seven Norwegian regional municipalities.

40|$|Oxygen {{supports}} {{the life of}} all aerobic organisms and virtually every cell type is capable of sensing decreased tissue oxygenation, known as hypoxia. Hypoxic microenvironments have been detected within developing solid tumors {{as a result of}} insufficient host vascular delivery of oxygen and nutrients. Consequently, the formation of solid tumors requires the <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> angiogenesis: the <b>recruitment</b> <b>of</b> blood vessels for the purpose of tumor vascularization. Furthermore, clinical and experimental evidence have demonstrated that hypoxic cells in solid tumors can limit the efficacy of standard anticancer therapeutics including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Low oxygenation can also accelerate malignant progression and metastasis resulting in poorer prognosis irrespective of the chosen treatment regiment. It is the focus of our research to improve our understanding of the molecular events that support the development of tumor cell resistance to hypoxia as a tool for the discovery of effective therapeutics that can specifically and effectively target hypoxic tumors. Understanding exactly how tumor cells adapt to transient hypoxia could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets that in combination therapy with current anticancer treatments could help reduce the incidence of morbidity and mortality from cancer...|$|R
40|$|Specialized plant cells {{arise from}} {{undifferentiated}} cells {{through a series}} of developmental steps. The decision to enter into a certain differentiation pathway depends in many cases on signals from neighbouring cells. The ability of cells to engage in short-range intercellular communication permits the <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> cell actions necessary in many developmental processes. Overexpression of genes from the DEVIL/ROTUNDIFOLIA (DVL/ROT) family results in severe developmental alterations, but very little is known about their mechanism of action. This work presents evidence that suggests a role for these genes in local signalling, specifically in the <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> socket cell <b>recruitment</b> and differentiation. Overexpression of different DVL genes results in protuberances {{at the base of the}} trichomes surrounded by several rows of elongated epidermal cells, morphologically similar to socket cells. Localized overexpression of DVL 4 in trichomes and socket cells during early developmental stages activates expression of socket cell markers in additional cells, farther away from the trichome. The same phenomenon is observed in an activation tagged line of DVL 1, which also shows an increase in the number of socket cells in contact with the trichome. The roles of individual DVL genes have been difficult to discover since their overexpression phenotypes are quite similar. In gl 1 leaves that lack trichomes and socket cells DVL 1 expression shows a 69 % reduction, suggesting that this gene could be involved in the <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> socket cell development in wild-type plants...|$|R

40|$|A {{stringent}} {{control of}} the intracellular balance and activity of energy-dependent proteolysis systems is vital for pro- and eukaryotic cells. While eubacterial Clp-proteases are mainly controlled by gene expression, eukaryotic 26 S proteasomes can be controlled by gene-expression as well by the incorporation and activation dynamics of their active beta-subunits. We reported, that the proteases ClpCP and ClpEP in Gram-positive bacteria are negatively regulated by the differential stability of the CtsR repressor. Mammalian cells are able {{to compensate for the}} inhibition of intracellular proteasomal activity by de novo formation of proteasome complexes in a positive autoregulatory feed-back loop. Both, constitutive (c 20 S) as well as immunoproteasomes (i 20 S) are exclusively formed de novo following a sophisticated and not yet fully understood biogenesis program involving the biosynthesis of all subunits, their assembly and maturation processes. Importantly, biogenesis of eukaryotic 20 S complexes is assisted by helper factors. The proteasome maturation protein POMP is essentially required for <b>coordination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recruitment</b> <b>of</b> the beta-subunit proforms and their processing by a cis- and trans autocatalysis. Final activation of the beta-subunits requires the formation of the preholoproteasome assembly intermediate by dimerization of two hemiproteasome intermediates that undergo structural rearrangements. Concomitantly, the cis and trans-autocatalytic removal of the beta-subunit-propeptides liberates the active site threonines of the now fully active 20 S core proteasome. At this stage the degradation of POMP signals the successful completion of the proteasome biogenesis program. Assembly of i 20 S basically follows the same principle after the coincident induction of POMP and the three immunosubunits by Interferon-gamma. The dynamics of this process is determined by the rapid activation of beta 5 i/ LMP 7 and the immediate beta 5 i/LMP 7 -dependent degradation of POMP. The molecular interplay between POMP and the beta 5 i subunit LMP 7 essentially accelerate immunoproteasome biogenesis compared to constitutive 20 S proteasome assembly nearly four-fold. Moreover, i 20 S formation is a transient response, since immunoproteasomes exhibit a considerably shortened half-life compared to constitutive proteasomes. Viruses and malignant cells have developed strategies to escape elimination of the immune system. The inhibition of proteasome activity in cells by HIV- 1 Tat through direct interaction with alpha- and beta-subunits contributes to the immune escape of the HI-virus. In addition, we described a novel mechanism that supports to the process of oncogenesis. Human cancer cells preferentially express the non-functional immunosubunit-variant LMP 7 E 1, which results in i 20 S deficiency...|$|R

In order to understand how cells utilize elementary Ca 2 + release events, we imaged Ca 2 + transients evoked through the phosphoinositide pathway in HeLa cells using confocal microscopy. During the pacemaker phase leading to the global Ca 2 + signal, elementary Ca 2 + release events were recruited in (1) frequency, (2) amplitude, and (3) spatial domains. Since each digital elementary event contributes to a small change of the analog cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration, the net effect of the advancement in the three domains is to drive the ambient Ca 2 + concentration toward a threshold where the signal becomes regenerative, resulting in a global Ca 2 + wave...|$|R

40|$|T cell {{activation}} {{takes place}} {{in the context of a}} spatial and kinetic reorganization of cell surface proteins and signaling molecules at the contact site with an antigen presenting cell, termed the immunological synapse. <b>Coordination</b> <b>of</b> the activation, <b>recruitment,</b> and signaling from T cell receptor (TCR) in conjunction with adhesion and costimulatory receptors regulates both the initiation and duration of signaling that is required for T cell activation. The costimulatory receptor, CD 28, is an essential signaling molecule that determines the quality and quantity of T cell immune responses. Although the functional consequences of CD 28 engagement are well described, the molecular mechanisms that regulate CD 28 function are largely unknown. Using a micropipet adhesion frequency assay, we show that TCR signaling enhances the direct binding between CD 28 and its ligand, CD 80. Although CD 28 is expressed as a homodimer, soluble recombinant CD 28 can only bind ligand monovalently. Our data suggest that the increase in CD 28 -CD 28 binding is mediated through a change in CD 28 valency. Molecular dynamic simulations and in vitro mutagenesis indicate that mutations at the base of the CD 28 homodimer interface, distal to the ligand-binding site, can induce a change in the orientation of the dimer that allows for bivalent ligand binding. When expressed in T cells, this mutation allows for high avidity CD 28 –CD 80 interactions without TCR signaling. Molecular dynamic simulations also suggest that wild type CD 28 can stably adopt a bivalent conformation. These results support a model whereby inside-out signaling from the TCR can enhance CD 28 ligand interactions b...|$|R
