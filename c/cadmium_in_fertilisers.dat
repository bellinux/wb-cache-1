40|$|Risk-reducing {{measures}} for cadmium {{have long been}} an important issue <b>in</b> Sweden. <b>Cadmium</b> is highlighted <b>in</b> the national environmental objective of A Non-Toxic Environment. Newly produced articles are {{as far as possible}} to be free of cadmium from 2010, and exposure of the population to cadmium through food and at work is to be at such a level that it is safe from a long-term public-health perspective by 2015. The Swedish Chemicals Agency (KemI) has been assigned by the Government to conduct an assessment of the risks posed by cadmium (Cd) to human health and environment, on the basis of Swedish conditions, and to draw attention to any need for a lower national limit value for <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> mineral <b>fertilisers</b> than the current value, which is 100 milligrams of cadmium per kilogram of phosphorus. This part of the remit is reported {{in the first part of}} the report – Risks to health and the environment. The remit also included drawing attention to how a system to follow up <b>cadmium</b> levels <b>in</b> mineral <b>fertilisers</b> should suitably be formulated, which is presented in the second part of the report - Systems to follow up <b>cadmium</b> levels <b>in</b> mineral <b>fertilisers.</b> Beyond drawing attention to any need for a lower national limit value and the follow-up system, the remit did not include analysing or proposing possible measures to limit exposure...|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus is an {{important}} nutrient in plant cultivation. Global reserves of phosphate rock worth mining are limited. Reuse of phosphorus in wastewater is therefore important. This LCA study assessed {{the environmental impact of}} four ways to supply Swedish agriculture with phosphorus fertiliser of acceptable quality as regards cadmium content: mineral fertiliser; certified sewage sludge; struvite (MgNH 4 PO 4 · 6 H 2 O) precipitated from wastewater; and phosphorus recovered from sludge incineration. These were examined with respect to impacts on global warming, eutrophication, energy demand and cadmium flows to farmland. The functional unit chosen was 11 kg P (25. 2 kg P 2 O 5) to agricultural land, which was the average phosphorus output (removal with harvest) per hectare from Swedish farmland in 2007. Using sewage sludge directly on farmland was the most efficient option in terms of energy and emissions of greenhouse gases, but also added most cadmium to the soil. Phosphorus recovery from incinerated sludge was the most energy demanding option and gave most emissions of greenhouse gases. Despite great concerns about <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> Swedish <b>fertilisers</b> and sludge, it was found that almost no regular analyses for cadmium are made on imported food by the authorities, although food imports are constantly increasing. Total imports of cadmium with food are therefore unknown...|$|R

40|$|Cadmium is a nephrotoxic metal with {{increasing}} levels in arable soils. The non-smoking population {{is exposed to}} cadmium mainly from vegetable food, especially cereal products. The major part of pig feed is cereals, and accumulated <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> pig kidney could reflect <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> the local agricultural environment. In this thesis, the possibility to use pig kidney as a bioindicator {{of the availability of}} <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> the agricultural environment was evaluated. There were significant correlations between <b>cadmium</b> levels <b>in</b> soil and wheat, between feed and kidney and between feed and faeces. <b>Cadmium</b> level <b>in</b> feed explained 12 % of the variance of <b>cadmium</b> level <b>in</b> kidney. <b>Cadmium</b> levels <b>in</b> barley, the main ingredient in the feeds, were not correlated to feed or kidney. The non-locally produced feed components rapeseed and soybean meal, vitamin-mineral mixtures and beet fibre contributed to a large extent to the <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> feed. The nonlocally produced feed components constitute an external source of cadmium to the arable soils when farmyard manure is applied, as most <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> feed is excreted in faeces. Pigs given feeds with less rapeseed and soybean meal and more cereals than controls, had lower cadmium intake, but higher <b>cadmium</b> levels <b>in</b> kidney than control pigs. This can partly be explained by different bioavailability of <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> different feed components. <b>Cadmium</b> level <b>in</b> kidney was positively related to age at slaughter and negatively related to kidney weight. No difference in kidney levels of cadmium due to sex was seen. <b>Cadmium</b> levels <b>in</b> kidney differed between breeds given the same feed. Organically outdoor raised pigs had higher levels in kidneys and faeces than conventional pigs raised indoors, despite a lower <b>cadmium</b> level <b>in</b> the organic feed. The organic pigs were exposed to cadmium from soil via rooting. Differences in feed compositions and bioavailability of cadmium from the feed components may also explain the different kidney levels of cadmium. However, no significant difference <b>in</b> solubility of <b>cadmium</b> from the feeds after in vitro digestion was detected. When soil was added to the feed and digested in vitro, the fractional solubility of cadmium was decreased. Animals from the same farm and raised under similar conditions had <b>cadmium</b> levels <b>in</b> kidney that could differ several times. This great variation together with the high cadmium contribution from non-locally produced feed components limit the possibilities to use <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> pig kidney as an indicator of available <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> the agricultural environment...|$|R
40|$|Seven {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} {{in the city of}} Christchurch (New Zealand) in order both to obtain comprehensive data describing the concentrations of <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> the environment, and determine factors likely to influence these concentrations. In three of the surveys - examining <b>cadmium</b> concentrations <b>in</b> air, riverwater and horse-chestnut leaves - samples were collected over long time periods. Levels of <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> dust and soil, house-dust, commercial products and foods were examined in the other four surveys. Concentrations of copper, lead and zinc were also measured <b>in</b> many cases. <b>Cadmium</b> adsorption by - and mobility in - a Christchurch soil, weathering of a cadmium-containing paint and galvanized-iron, the behaviour of <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> samples being sequentially extracted, and speciations of <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> soils, road-dusts, house-dusts riverwater, and plastics were also studied. High levels of <b>cadmium</b> were found <b>in</b> road-dust in the immediate vicinity of some industrial operations, but concentrations in the wider Christchurch environment were generally low. House-dusts contained higher concentrations of cadmium than typical external dusts. <b>Cadmium</b> concentrations <b>in</b> some commercial products were very high; however, there appeared to be little risk of cadmium being significantly mobilized during the use of most of these products. Probable daily intakes of cadmium were estimated. Numerous factors influenced the levels of <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> the various materials examined. A Christchurch soil strongly adsorbed cadmium and the mobility of <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> this soil was low. Reagent selectivity for the forms of cadmium during sequential extraction was in some cases good and in some cases poor; little redistribution of cadmium occurred between phases during sequential extractions. Various factors were found to effect the adsorption and mobility of <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> soil, the outcome of each sequential extraction, and the weathering of cadmium from cadmium-containing paint and galvanized-iron...|$|R

40|$|Human cadmium intake derives {{mainly from}} food sources, and cadmium can {{be present in}} high {{concentrations}} in some offal.

Resulting predictions of <b>cadmium</b> accumulation <b>in</b> sheep are applicable to a broad set of exposure situations allowing the critical examination of <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> the human food chain. The product of the <b>cadmium</b> concentration <b>in</b> the feed and the duration of exposure to that feed were significant predictors of the <b>cadmium</b> concentration <b>in</b> livers and kidneys.

Other variables (dry matter intake, the vehicle of the elevated <b>cadmium</b> <b>in</b> the diet, animal age, weight, and sex) were not significant. As a result, the prime measure to decrease the risk of cadmium from animal origin adversely affecting human health should be restricting the animals 2 ̆ 7 cumulative cadmium intake.
