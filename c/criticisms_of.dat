5|$|Agnosticism is criticized from {{a variety}} of standpoints. Some {{religious}} thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism. Some atheists criticize {{the use of the term}} agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.|$|E

5|$|Putnam himself {{may be his}} own most {{formidable}} philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> {{the film}} were that its {{characters}} were underdeveloped, its script was crowded, {{and it was}} overlong.

Foxx's portrayal of Max Dillon/Electro was met with mixed reviews.|$|E

During the program, Chappell reiterated his <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> cricket's administration at the time.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> the three-tiered {{scrutiny}} analysis, {{the most compelling}} reason against its adoption arguably being {{that it does not}} control judicial discretion: the identification of classifications as suspect, quasi-suspect or non-suspect involves unconstrained balancing of public and private interests, and political and social interests.|$|E
5|$|Various {{groups have}} {{expressed}} reservations about, and <b>criticisms</b> <b>of,</b> {{parts of the}} New England Quarter development or the scheme as a whole.

5|$|Although {{the ontological}} {{argument}} {{may have been}} implicit {{in the works of}} Greek philosophers such as Plato and the Neoplatonists, the mainstream view is that the ontological argument was first clearly stated and developed by Anselm of Canterbury. Some scholars argued that the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) developed a special kind of ontological argument before Anselm, but other scholars have doubted this position. Daniel Dombrowski marked three major stages {{in the development of the}} argument: Anselm's initial explicit formulation; the eighteenth century <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> Kant and Hume; and the identification of a second ontological argument in Anselm's Proslogion by twentieth century philosophers.|$|E
5000|$|Brian Klug {{argues that}} this {{definition}} proscribed legitimate <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> {{the human rights}} record of the Israeli Government by attempting to bring <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> Israel {{into the category of}} antisemitism, and does not sufficiently distinguish between <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> Israeli actions and <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> Zionism as a political ideology, on the one hand, and racially based violence towards, discrimination against, or abuse of, Jews. Sociologist Paul Igansky states that parallels between Israeli policy and those of the Nazis are [...] "arguably not intrinsically antisemitic", and that the context in which they are made is critical.|$|R

5|$|Brown sat {{his players}} down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested {{them on their}} knowledge of the playbook, requiring them to copy down every play in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse man, and his <b>criticisms</b> <b>of</b> players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, told them not to smoke in public and made coats and ties mandatory on road trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E
5|$|<b>Criticisms</b> <b>of</b> Abercrombie {{begin with}} his {{reliance}} on relatively poor intelligence. Reports reached {{him that the}} French strength at Carillon was 6,000, and that a further 3,000 were expected. Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives, and Abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry. Even if the reports were accurate, Abercrombie's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm. The same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort, a sign that a siege would have ended quickly.|$|E
40|$|At {{the same}} time as a purported renewal of metaphysics is taking place in {{analytical}} philosophy, <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> metaphysics has also increased. <b>Criticism</b> <b>of</b> metaphysics is usually made by naturalistic metaphysicians and is aimed at non-naturalistic metaphysics. Without endorsing any of the above schools, in this essay I undertake, not a <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> metaphysics, but a <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> the current <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> metaphysics. I therefore review {{some of the most important}} issues at stake in this criticism, which merely recycles centuries-old <b>criticism</b> <b>of</b> metaphysics in general: the alleged sterility and futility of metaphysics, its vagueness, the propensity for fantasy, the lack of imagination and foresight, its alleged dependence on intuition and, above all, its independence from experience. I conclude that all these criticisms supply an inaccurate image of metaphysics and a concomitant inaccurate image of science rooted in a refusal to recognize that a strict separation between a priori and a posteriori cannot be achieved...|$|R
