5|$|Feduccia's frill {{argument}} was followed up {{in several other}} publications, in which researchers interpreted the filamentous impressions around Sinosauropteryx fossils as remains of collagen fibres rather than primitive feathers. Since the structures are clearly external to the body, these researchers have proposed that the fibres formed a frill {{on the back of}} the animal and underside of its tail, similar to some modern aquatic lizards. The absence of feathers would refute the proposal that Sinosauropteryx is the most basal known theropod genus with feathers, and also raise questions about the current theory of feather origins itself. It <b>calls</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> the idea that the first feathers evolved not for flight but for insulation, and that they made their first appearance in relatively basal dinosaur lineages that later evolved into modern birds.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{taxonomy}} of Theriosuchus itself is somewhat convoluted. Many recent taxonomic studies have not provided an explicit set of characteristics that unite species of Theriosuchus and separate them from other atoposaurids; the only such diagnoses {{that have been}} produced were given by Steve Salisbury and Darren Naish in 2011, and Jeremy Martin et al. in 2010. In 2016 Mark Young et al. criticized these diagnoses, noting that many characters were either more widely distributed among the Atoposauridae, difficult to assess, or - {{in the case of}} the latter diagnosis - not present at all. Young et al. provided an alternative diagnosis containing nine traits, mostly involving teeth; however, they also noted that there was variation among the expression of these traits, which <b>calls</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> the monophyly of Theriosuchus. K. langenbergensis differs from this diagnosis in four out of nine traits, which Schwarz et al. cited as a basis for both the generic separation of Knoetschkesuchus and the necessity of revising the diagnosis further.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent study}} by Cohen, Alvarez & Nakayama (2011) <b>calls</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> the {{validity}} of evidence supporting the attention-free hypothesis. They found that participants did display inattentional blindness while doing certain kinds of multiple-object tracking (MOT) and rapid serial visual presentation (RVSP) tasks. Furthermore, Cohen et al. found that participants' natural scene perception was impaired under dual-task conditions, but that this dual-task impairment happened only when participants' primary task was sufficiently demanding. The authors concluded that previous studies showing {{the absence of a}} need for focused attention did not use tasks that were demanding enough to fully engage attention.|$|E

25|$|John Launer's 2015 {{biography}} of Spielrein (in English) {{is based on}} close readings of her hospital notes, diaries and correspondence, and <b>calls</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> many of the received accounts about Spielrein. He challenges the presumption that Jung psychoanalyzed Spielrien in any systematic way, reciprocated her feelings for long, saw her as his 'anima', or regarded her as a more significant figure than his other female partners of the time. Instead, Launer sees her historical importance as someone who made an early attempt to harmonize psychoanalysis and developmental psychology within an overarching biological framework, anticipating modern ideas from attachment theory and evolutionary psychology.|$|E
25|$|Literalists {{prefer the}} Masoretic text, on which Protestant Bibles are based, but the Masoretic text {{sometimes}} contains absurdities, as when it states that Saul {{came to the}} throne {{at the age of}} one and reigned for two years. Such obvious errors can be corrected by reference to other versions of the Bible (in this case the Septuagint, which gives more realistic numbers), but their existence <b>calls</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> the fundamentalist idea that the MT text is the inspired word of God. Most fundamentalists, with the notable exception of the King James Only movement, avoid this by holding that only the authors of the original autographs (the very first copies written by Moses and others) were inspired by God.|$|E
25|$|Metaphysical naturalists do {{not believe}} in a soul or spirit, nor in ghosts, and when {{explaining}} what constitutes the mind they rarely appeal to substance dualism. If one's mind, or rather one's identity and existence as a person, is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. First, all mental contents (such as ideas, theories, emotions, moral and personal values, or aesthetic response) exist solely as computational constructions of one's brain and genetics, not as things that exist independently of these. Second, damage to the brain (regardless of how) should be of great concern. Third, death or destruction of one's brain cannot be survived, which is to say, all humans are mortal. Stace, however, believes that ecstatic mysticism <b>calls</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> the assumption that awareness is impossible without data processing.|$|E

25|$|This is {{now known}} as the Siege of Calcutta. It is said that 123 Britons later died in the Black Hole of Calcutta after his victory, but recent {{evidence}} <b>calls</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> the numbers involved, and suggests that the Nawab himself was probably unaware of what transpired. He renamed Calcutta Alinagar after the previous Nawab, and his maternal grandfather, Alivardi Khan. Having installed Manikchand as the ruler of Alinagar, Siraj returned to Murshidabad. Soon (on 2 January 1757) Watson and Robert Clive retook Calcutta with a force of Company sepoys and the assistance of the Royal Navy. Hearing the news, Siraj ud-Daula moved to attack Calcutta, but fearing an attack from Ahmad Shah Abdali, after a few days of war he signed the Treaty of Alinagar with the East India Company, giving them permission to build the fort.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the belief}} that John was taught at both the Carmelite College of San Andr√®s and at the University of Salamanca has been criticised. He argues, firstly, that {{it is unclear whether}} there were in fact lectures in arts and {{theology}} at the College of San Andr√®s before 1571, that a reconstruction of the typical timetable of teaching at the University of Salamanca shows that there would have been little time for extra teaching at the College of the San Andr√®s, and that what therefore happened at San Andr√®s (if indeed it happened at all) is therefore likely to have taken the form of rehearsals, preparation of classes, and not in an official form ‚Äî making the idea that John received systematic exposure to Baconthorpe less likely. More controversially, Bezares <b>calls</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> whether John even studied theology at the University of Salamanca. The philosophy courses John probably took in logic, natural and moral philosophy, can be reconstructed, but Bezares argues that John in fact abandoned his studies at Salamanca in 1568 to join Teresa, rather than having graduated, meaning that he did not study theology in Salamanca.|$|E
25|$|The book begins {{immediately}} {{following the death of}} Zosima. It is a commonly held perception in the town, and the monastery as well, that true holy men's bodies are incorrupt, i.e., they do not succumb to putrefaction. Thus, the expectation concerning the Elder Zosima is that his deceased body will not decompose. It comes as a great shock to the entire town that Zosima's body not only decays, but begins the process almost {{immediately following}} his death. Within the first day, the smell of Zosima's body is already unbearable. For many this <b>calls</b> <b>into</b> <b>question</b> their previous respect and admiration for Zosima. Alyosha is particularly devastated by the sullying of Zosima's name due to nothing more than the corruption of his dead body. One of Alyosha's companions in the monastery named Rakitin uses Alyosha's vulnerability to set up a meeting between him and Grushenka. However, instead of Alyosha becoming corrupted, he is able to earn fresh faith and hope from Grushenka, while Grushenka's troubled mind begins the path of spiritual redemption through his influence: they become close friends. The book ends with the spiritual regeneration of Alyosha as he embraces, kisses the earth outside the monastery (echoing, perhaps, Zosima's last earthly act before his death) and cries convulsively until finally going back out into the world, as Zosima instructed, renewed.|$|E
