500|$|Domestic {{guinea pigs}} {{generally}} live in cages, although some owners {{of large numbers}} of guinea pigs dedicate entire rooms to their pets. Cages with solid or wire mesh floors are used, although wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as bumblefoot (ulcerative pododermatitis). [...] "Cubes and Coroplast" [...] (or C) style cages are now a common choice. Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material. Bedding made from red cedar (Eastern or Western) and pine, both softwoods, were commonly used in the past, but these materials are now believed to contain harmful phenols (aromatic hydrocarbons) and oils. Safer beddings made from hardwoods (such as aspen), paper products, and <b>corn</b> <b>cob</b> materials are other alternatives. Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them, and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces, making it difficult to remove. After its cage has been cleaned, a guinea pig typically urinates and drags its lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory. Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages.|$|E

2500|$|Most of what {{is known}} about pre-historic Oaxaca comes from work in the Central Valleys region. Evidence of human {{habitation}} dating back to about 11,000 years BC has been found in the Guilá Naquitz cave near the town of Mitla.

[...] More finds of nomadic peoples date back to about 5000 BC, with some evidence of the beginning of agriculture. By 2000 BC, agriculture had been established in the Central Valleys region of the state, with sedentary villages. The diet developed around this time would remain until the Spanish Conquest, consisting primarily of harvested corn, beans, chocolate, tomatoes, chili peppers, squash and gourds. Meat was generally hunted and included tepescuintle, turkey, deer, peccary, armadillo and iguana.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to study the removal of {{methylene}} blue (MB) from aqueous solutions by adsorption on <b>corn</b> <b>cobs</b> in static and dynamic modes. This agricultural by-product was first characterized and then a series of experiments was conducted to highlight the effect of different operating conditions on the adsorption capacity. Batch experiments revealed that adsorption of MB on <b>corn</b> <b>cobs</b> is affected by too acidic medium. Equilibrium data were represented well by a Langmuir isotherm equation with maximum adsorption capacity of 40 mg/g. RL values obtained at different dye concentration indicate that the sorption of MB on <b>corn</b> <b>cobs</b> is favorable. The second-order kinetic model describes perfectly adsorption kinetic data and adsorption may be controlled by external mass transfer followed by intra-particle diffusion mass transfer. The effectiveness of <b>corn</b> <b>cobs</b> biomass in the removal of methylene blue (MB) dye from its aqueous solution was tested by a fixed-bed column adsorption study. The results of dynamic mode were then modelled using Thomas and Yoon-Nelson equations.
