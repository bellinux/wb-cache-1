Its thick strokes, compressed letterspacing, and minimal interior <b>counterform</b> are specifically aimed, {{as its name}} suggests, to [...] "impact". Impact has a high x-height, reaching nearly to three-quarters the capital line. Ascenders are short, and descenders even shorter. With narrow apertures and folded-up letterforms, the lower-case can be quite hard to read printed small, especially for people with vision problems. The face is intended for headlines and display use rather than body text. As a display design, it was not released with an italic or bold weight.|$|E

For Ruskin, {{the city}} {{is a place of}} collective memory, a space where buildings are analogized as texts—"the criticism of the building is to be conducted precisely on the same principles as that of a book," he contends (Works, 10 : 269). In the evangelical tradition of Ruskin's upbringing, this interpretation of architecture is a kind of lectio divina; a great building is a sacred palimpsest for those who read the fabric with patience and insight. Equally, a text such as the three volumes of his Stones of Venice is endowed with a tectonic in <b>counterform</b> to the city it depicts. Thus, the first volume is constructed from quarry to cornice; Ruskin demands his readers to roll up their sleeves, gives them "stones, and bricks, and straw, chisels and trowels, and the ground, and then asks [them] to build" (Works, 9 : 73). In exploring these analogous spaces of text and architecture, this research operates within the empirical and documentary arena of Ruskinian interpretation, working with the primary notebooks, worksheets, and diaries from which the Stones of Venice was constructed. It examines the reciprocity between Ruskin's multiple readings of the urban fabric, the erection of the manuscript of Stones, and the playing out of his intimate physical knowledge of the city in themes of metaphor, memory and material...|$|E
40|$|We cannot {{remember}} without architecture declares John Ruskin (1819 - 1900) in 'The Lamp of Memory' of his The Seven Lamps of Architecture (1849). For Ruskin {{the city}} is a space of collective memory, charged with metaphoric import: equally buildings can be analogized as texts – 'the criticism of a building is to be approached precisely on the same principles {{as that of a}} book', he contends. In the evangelical tradition of Ruskin's upbringing, there is a strong sense of lectio divina in this kind of interpretation. A great building is a sacred palimpsest of many layers: 'the main and leading idea is on its surface', but there are many depths to be plumbed and interpreted to those who can read the fabric with patience and insight. Reciprocally, a text like the three volumes of his Stones of Venice is endowed with a tectonic and a spatiality, in <b>counterform</b> to the city it depicts. The first volume is constructed from quarry to cornice; it demands its readers to roll up their sleeves, gives them 'stones, and bricks, and straw, chisel and trowels, and the ground, and then asks [them] to build'. In exploring these analogous spaces of text and architecture, this paper operates within the empirical and documentary arena of Ruskinian interpretation, working with the primary notebooks, worksheets and diaries from which the Stones of Venice was constructed. It examines the interchange between Ruskin's exhaustive encounter with the thingness of the urban fabric, the erection of the manuscript, and the playing out of this intimate physical knowledge of the city in themes of metaphor, memory and material...|$|E

Bell Centennial was designed to address and overcome most {{of the limitations of}} telephone directory printing: poor reproduction due to high-speed printing on newsprint, and ink spread which decayed legibility as it closed up <b>counterforms.</b> Carter's design increased the x-height of lowercase characters, slightly condensed the character width, and carved out many more open counters and bowls to increase legibility. To anticipate and blunt the degradation caused by ink spread, Carter drew the letters with deep ink traps, designed to fill in as the ink spread onto newsprint fiber, leaving the characters' <b>counterforms</b> open and legible at small point sizes.|$|R

This condition urges us to take on other ways of thinking, since conventional engineering and technology approaches tend to only produce more of the same. We argue that the mode of thinking embodied in imagineering and projecting is a viable route towards a critical and utopian approach that allows to produce alternatives. Utopia-driven projective research is grounded in architecture and urbanism and aims to integrate scientific modes of knowledge production and design-based, poetic modes of knowledge building. We see it as critical – disagreeing with some protagonists of the so-called ‘criticality-debate’ (Fischer 2012; Heynen 2007) – because utopian thinking starts from a basic uneasiness about current conditions, striving to formulate desirable futures. Likewise, projective thinking can be tuned towards the finding of alternatives for the present, unsustainable urbanization models. We will substantiate this argument by showing, in a diagrammatic way, how conceptual design projects open up a space of possibilities, helping us to start exploring other modes of building communities and relating to the environment. We will refer to four projects that have an urban and landscape scale and scope: The Unadapted City (TOP Office 1995 - 2004), M. U. D (FLCextended 2005), COASTOMIZE! (FLCextended 2008), The Future Commons 2070 (magnificentsurroundings. org 2008 - 2011). Using design-thinking can help us to better imagine and conceive how values and judgments can be made productive as active agents in the {{development of}} future <b>counterforms</b> for society (Schuman 1981). These <b>counterforms</b> should not be seen as a kind of fixed and definitive blueprints, but rather as mediating forces that enable and stimulate social transformations. We thus argue for utopian-driven projective research as a form of social transformation in the making – the effort to work through the possibilities of fragmentary change and incomplete, unfinished projects that harbor the desire for better worlds. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The Houston Constellation {{is a type}} of {{architectural}} urbanism situated at the intersection of urban revision and projections for cultures yet unknown. The intent is to provide a template for refiguring new lines of sight and interaction within the contemporary city, between contingent forces, institutions, and a public in flux. The Houston Superdistrict: a heterogeneous collection of 20 th Century urban paradigms packed loosely underneath a thick canopy. Institutions in medicine, the arts, education, and recreation make it a major hub for local and global populations. The area is undergoing a transformation, yet in contrast to its ambitious visions, current plans project investment that may drop more single objects into this static field. This project proposes an alternative. A constellation of form that slides across cold boundaries and catalyzes a new spatial consciousness to produce a newly legible environment. Encouraging creativity- the very hope for the district in the first place- begins with architectural performance and contextual interaction. Techniques and tactics of planametric alignment, visual continuity, and material cohesion provide the system a relational fitness, while establishing a larger <b>counterform</b> against context’s existing linear boulevards, axes, and grids. Four forms (R,G,B,O) based on site-specific conditions, constitute programmatic points with distinct characters. A complementary duality, the figures in the park (O & B) engage the spatial and airy quality of the city. While the institutional figures (R & G) embed themselves within the local form of their respective campuses. Producing new linkages between fabric and institution: the Museum of Fine Arts Houston and Rice University link through a new space for the arts in the public realm.

40|$|This Creative Arts {{doctoral}} {{project has}} engaged visual arts practice and academic investigation of national monuments in North Cyprus as complementary kinds of research via {{an exploration of}} material memory in relation to objects in the everyday surroundings. With regard to the decades-old intercommunal dispute in Cyprus, indications are that there are enduring habits of representation that both signal {{and participate in the}} non-resolved nature of the situation. Without the Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot groups establishing for themselves the links of interdependency between how they represent each other and how they represent their own identities to themselves, they have yet to be fully engaged with respect to the history of antagonistic differentiation that they have participated in. The monumental commemorative forms in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus are approached as visual elements in the everyday environment, ordinary yet extraordinary as objects condensed out of the flux of events, culture, memory, and experience in an interplay of the visible and the invisible. In this context it is proposed that Turkish Cypriot history be seen as a discursive interplay of presence and absence, where the subject is the people themselves, in which the national monuments began to appear at a particular point in time and continue to do so both as symbolic and concrete form and <b>counterform</b> in an on-going discourse. The visual arts practice stream of the research involved enquiry into ways of seeing and habits of thought in responding to the immediate surroundings. The artist’s own registering processes and thoughts became included as subjects of the explorations, in acknowledgement of a kind of dialectic involving personal (inner) and public (outer) space. In this art practice, the process of realisation and the realised object are active together in the social realm with simultaneous awareness of the individuality of perception, memory, and cognition involved in the interactivity, and the responsibilities therein. During this project, considerable reciprocity developed between the artistic practice and the academic research. The project makes a contribution to the visual cultural history of the Turkish Cypriot community and of Cyprus more broadly. It may also indicate some avenues of further exploration in research practice in bringing together different ways or kinds of thinking including the visual and artistic.

40|$|Rare and {{precious}} window elements from the Paleochristian Basilica of Saint Sabina in Rome, made of plaster gypsum with translucent selenite used as glass for light transmission, were discovered by Antonio Muñoz during {{the restoration of}} the building {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th c. Originally standing within the stone window frame, were then mounted on wood planks with screws for holding together the scattered fragments. The surfaces were covered with grime and the selenite elements were blinded by the wooden supports. During the recent conservation treatment at ISCR, traces of Egyptian blue on the internal surfaces were detected. Cleaning with laser allowed their conservation and the removal of gypsum deposits from the fragile selenite. 3 -D scanning was performed for milling, out of polystyrene blocks, the <b>counterforms</b> that were needed for turning the artifacts upside down. After cleaning and re-assembling of the fragments, a new 3 -D scan was performed to obtain a complete model of the artifacts that was used to define the best orientation of the windows, both for exhibition purposes and for the distribution of the weight-related stresses. Following a project based on 3 -D modeling, exhibition stands were produced with a core material milled out of PET foam, reinforced with outer skins made with carbon fiber adhered under vacuum to the core material with epoxy resin. The new exhibition stands, very light and rigid, permit all-round appreciation of the artifacts and allow the light to shine through the selenite elements...|$|R
