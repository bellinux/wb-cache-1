This paper investigates how to optimize the control of condenser fans within the chillers to maximize their coefficients of performance (COPs). A thermodynamic model for the chillers was developed and used to analyse the steady-state COP under various load and ambient conditions. An algorithm is introduced to compute the number of staged condenser fans based on settings of the condensing pressure and outdoor temperature. The model was validated using the experimental data and performance data of an existing chiller running under various operating conditions. It is found that the best strategy for switching condenser fans is to vary their rotating speed by the use of a set point of the condensing temperature, which is adjusted in response to the chiller load and condenser air-inlet temperature.

Factors that are considered in evaluating a model include accuracy, training data requirements, calibration effort, generality, and computational requirements. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate different modeling approaches for their applicability to model based FDD of vapor compression chillers. Three different models were studied: the Gordon and Ng Universal Chiller model (2 nd generation) and a modified version of the ASHRAE Primary Toolkit model, which are both based on first principles, and the DOE- 2 chiller model, as implemented in CoolTools TM, which is empirical. The models were compared in terms of their ability to reproduce the observed performance of an older, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>chiller</b> operating in a commercial office building and a newer <b>centrifugal</b> <b>chiller</b> in a laboratory. All three models displayed similar levels of accuracy. Of the first principles models, the Gordon-Ng model has the advantage of being linear in the parameters, which allows more robust parameter estimation methods to be used and facilitates estimation of the uncertainty in the parameter values. The ASHRAE Toolkit Model may have advantages when refrigerant temperature measurements are also available. The DOE- 2 model can be expected to have advantages when very limited data are available to calibrate the model, as long as one of the previously identified models in the CoolTools library matches the performance of the chiller in question...|$|E

The proposed method exploits Principal Component Analysis to distinguish between anomalies and normal operation variability and a reconstruction-based contribution approach to isolate variables related to faults.

40|$|Chilled water {{air-conditioning}} systems are the lifelines of cooling for large commercial, industrial and public buildings. The {{aim of this}} paper is to examine and evaluate damages sustained to a large hotel in Greece. The damage that discovered concerns corrosion and salt deposition problems of a chiller in the air-conditioning system. The hotel's air-conditioning system is part of the facility's electromechanical infrastructure and is comprised of three <b>centrifugal</b> chillers with <b>chilling</b> capacity equal to 500 tons each. The aforementioned chillers are supplied with water through the public water network, which firstly undergoes a softening process, performed by a softener, and covers all the hotel's requirements. The chillers supply chilled water to seven central air-conditioning units, which in turn supply with fresh air all the hotel facilities. The above system is not supplied by water continuously, but replenishes with the needed quantity, when necessary, usually due to evaporation during the chilling cycle (closed air-conditioning system). The results of the system's examination indicated accumulation of salts inside chiller tubes, which create a corrosive electrolytic environment, leading to the oxidation of metal and the creation of abrasion along its length. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Dynamic {{modeling}} of vapor compression equipment is gaining increasing attention in recent years. The availability of cheap and powerful computers is simplifying the heretofore formidable challenge of numerically solving the non-linear differential equations {{that arise in}} first-principle based system models. Recent advances in the HVAC industry such as fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) require, for the design and validation of algorithms, extensive chiller data with and without faults. Faulty performance data from chillers {{is extremely difficult to}} get from commercial installations and therefore models are necessary. This requirement necessitates the use of first-principles since the fault and its severity need to be varied in a physically meaningful manner to produce useful data. First-principles models involve the solution of transient mass, energy and momentum balances which are a system of non-linear, coupled, partial differential equations. Limited study has been done in the past on identifying efficient methods of formulating and solving these systems for centrifugal liquid chillers. Existing system models are either not for centrifugal compressors or do not contain enough detail in the heat exchangers to allow fault simulation. Also, little information is provided regarding the execution speed and accuracy of different modeling approaches. This thesis includes a comparison of the finite-volume and the moving-boundary formulations for modeling dynamics of shell-and-tube heat-exchangers. The finite volume models performance is investigated using direct solution methods with explicit integration and a sequential solution method with implicit integration. The moving boundary model is studied using a direct solution method and a state-space formulation. The goal is to identify the computationally most efficient approach for future model developers. Validation results with and without faults are presented, using data obtained from a 90 -ton <b>centrifugal</b> liquid <b>chiller</b> test-stand available at Herrick Labs, Purdue University. It is found that the direct solution methods are preferable for both the formulations. The sequential solution with implicit integration is less robust in convergence than the direct solution when the finite volume formulation is used. The state-space solution when using the moving boundary formulation is restricted to small transients due to the linearization approximation. Between the formulations, the finite volume tolerates a wider range of inlet conditions than the latter and is preferable when start-up is needed. The moving boundary approach executes twice as fast as the finite volume approach for comparable accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} in HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning) technology has rapidly {{increased in the}} last years. HVAC systems have become important {{in the design of}} medium-large buildings in order to ensure thermal comfort in the environments with respect to the temperature and humidity of the air. Control, optimisation and maintenance procedures are fundamental in HVAC systems in order to guarantee people comfort and energy efficient solutions in their management. Two different topics are covered in this thesis. Energy Efficient Control of Ice Thermal Energy Storage Systems HVAC plants have recently begun to be matched with thermal energy storage systems. If properly designed, installed, and maintained, these systems can be used to store energy when its cost is low and exploiting it when the price increases. In particular, in HVAC cooling systems, a common thermal storage medium is ice. From a control and optimisation point of view, a cooling plant with ice storage proves to be a complex system. Standard control strategies seem {{not to be able to}} achieve the right trade-off between energy efficiency and demand satisfaction. In this thesis, in order to design efficient control strategies for storage systems, a HVAC model with ice storage is developed in a simulation environment. The thermal behaviour of the HVAC system is derived from the mass and energy conservation equations; in particular the ice storage is considered a hybrid system, thus taking into consideration both sensible and latent heat. Three standard control methods are compared with a non-linear predictive control strategy. The simulations results show that the implemented non-linear predictive control strategy provides the best control for the efficient energy management of ice storage systems. Fault Detection in HVAC Systems Operating problems associated with degraded equipment, poor maintenance, and improperly implemented controls, plague many HVAC systems. Fault detection methods can therefore play a key role in monitoring complex HVAC plants, detecting anomalous behaviours in such a way as to keep the systems in their best operational conditions with minimum costs. In this thesis, fault detection and diagnosis methods on variable air volume (VAV) systems are first designed. To this aim, a VAV system model with two zones is developed; the control of system is obtained with a direct feedback linearisation technique. Supervised classification methods are used to detect and diagnose the simulated faults in the model. The simulations results show the good performances of the classification in the detection and diagnosis of the most common faults in VAV systems. Detection methods are then developed for the most relevant faults affecting chillers. To this aim, data collected in the research project 1043 -RP promoted by ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers) are used. In this project experimental studies were conducted on a <b>centrifugal</b> water-cooled <b>chiller</b> in order to collect data in both normal and faulty situations. The developed technique is based on one-class classification methods with a novelty detection approach, where only normal data are used to characterize the correct system behaviour. The classification results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method for the detection of the most common faults in chillers. ...|$|R

In addition, an approach based on the minimization of squared prediction error of reconstructed vector of variables was used to reconstruct the identified faulty-sensors, i. e., estimate their bias magnitudes.

This study investigates how {{the coefficient of}} performance (COP) of an air-cooled chiller varies with a mist precooler {{at different levels of}} cooling effectiveness. A multivariate regression model was developed to simulate the operating variables of an air-cooled chiller with mist precooling. The model was validated with typical performance data of an air-cooled <b>centrifugal</b> <b>chiller.</b> The COP would increase by up to 30 %, depending on the cooling effectiveness and the wet bulb depression-the difference between the dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures of outdoor air. At a large wet bulb depression, the percentage increase of COP tended to correlate linearly with the chiller capacity. Yet at a small wet bulb depression, the dynamic control of condensing temperature resulted in a non-linear relationship between the percentage change of COP and the cooling effectiveness. Further experimental work is required to optimize cooling effectiveness for the maximum COP. Hong Kong Community CollegeDepartment of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|A generic {{intelligent}} {{fault detection}} and diagnosis (FDD) strategy is proposed {{in this study}} to simulate the actual diagnostic thinking of chiller experts. A three-layer Diagnostic Bayesian Network (DBN) is developed to diagnose chiller faults based on the Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) theory. The structure of the DBN is a graphical and qualitative illustration of the intrinsic causal relationships among causal factors in Layer 1, faults in Layer 2 and fault symptoms in Layer 3. The parameters of the DBN represent the quantitative probabilistic relationships among the three layers. To diagnose chiller faults, posterior probabilities of the faults under observed evidences are calculated based on the probability analysis and the graph theory. Compared with other FDD strategies, the proposed strategy can make use of more useful information of the chiller concerned and expert knowledge.

A number of sensors of concern in chiller system monitoring and control are assigned into a PCA model, which can group these correlated variables and capture the systematic variations of chillers. Raw measurements or simple processing measurements of sensors may deteriorate the performance of sensor FDD&E strategy using PCA because of the embodied noises and dynamics.

40|$|As {{environmental}} regulations to stall global warming are strengthened around the world, studies using newly developed low {{global warming potential}} (GWP) alternative refrigerants are increasing. In this study, substitute refrigerants, R- 1234 ze (E) and R- 1233 zd (E), {{were used in the}} centrifugal compressor of an R- 134 a 2 -stage <b>centrifugal</b> <b>chiller</b> with a fixed rotational speed. Performance predictions and thermodynamic analyses of the centrifugal compressor for drop-in testing were performed. A performance prediction method based on the existing ASME PTC- 10 performance test code was proposed. The proposed method yielded the expected operating area and operating point of the centrifugal compressor with alternative refrigerants. The thermodynamic performance of the first and second stages of the centrifugal compressor was calculated as the polytropic state. To verify the suitability of the proposed method, the drop-in test results of the two alternative refrigerants were compared. The predicted operating range based on the permissible deviation of ASME PTC- 10 confirmed that the temperature difference was very small at the same efficiency. Because the drop-in test of R- 1234 ze (E) was performed within the expected operating range, the centrifugal compressor using R- 1234 ze (E) is considered well predicted. However, the predictions of the operating point and operating range of R- 1233 zd (E) were lower than those of the drop-in test. The proposed performance prediction method will assist in understanding thermodynamic performance at the expected operating point and operating area of a centrifugal compressor using alternative gases based on limited design and structure information...|$|E
40|$|Data Centers are {{facilities}} used to house {{a large number}} of computer systems and their associated components, such as telecommunications and data storage systems. Nowadays many organizations depend on the reliable operation of their data centers for their day to day business operations. Data centers are designed with redundant and backup power supplies, redundant data communications connections, robust cybersecurity protocols and very strict environmental controls. The many computer systems held in a typical data center generate large heat loads that need to be continuously removed with high grade air conditioning systems. Anthem currently owns a large corporate data center in Richmond that generates a large amount of waste heat that is currently dissipated into the environment. The objective of this project is to design a system that will help Anthem reuse some or most of the waste heat generated by the data center, possibly using it to heat the adjoining office building. The proposed system would not only reduce Anthem’s energy costs to heat the office building but it would decrease Anthem’s overall environmental footprint. The solution that the team decided upon is to add a second condenser bundle to an already existing <b>centrifugal</b> <b>chiller.</b> This would allow for a higher-grade heat to be produced. This hot water would then be piped to a coil within the make-up air handler units and the outside air that would normally be heated by natural gas will now be heated by the hot water. The air passing through the coil would now be hot usable air and thus able to be distributed throughout the building. [URL]...|$|E
