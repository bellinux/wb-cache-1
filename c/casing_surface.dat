When the cavitation is increasing, the flowing conditions are changing, which leads to an increase of vibrations of the pump and emitted noise in the surroundings.

A PhD written by Lorents Reinås studies the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> cement boundary condition and its effects on the fatigue analytical models. It proves that the cement level between the conductor and the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> is a sensitive input parameter in terms of fatigue calculations. This thesis will investigate how to detect this particular cement level in large sized casings, i. e. 20 ”, by utilizing existing technology.

By not knowing, one have to perform preventive measures. The reason for wanting to detect this cement level is to enable a better utilization of the wellhead.

This thesis presents an experimental and computational investigation into the local flow development and overall performance of two different severity diffusing annular sshaped ducts, with the same overall diffusion ratio of 1. 5, in order to validate the CFD code M. E. F. P. The first less severe diffusing duct was used to investigate the effects of inlet swirl on the duct performance. It was found that at an optimum swirl angle of 15 degrees, the duct total pressure loss coefficient was approximately half the value at 0 or 30 degrees swirl. The second more severely diffusing duct had simple symmetrical aerofoil struts added, which simulated struts required in real inter-turbine diffusers to support inner shafts and supply vital engine services. The total pressure loss developed by the 30 % shorter duct was 15 % greater that of the longer duct, and when struts were added to the second duct the loss almost doubled. These increases were attributed to gradually worsening <b>casing</b> <b>surface</b> flow separations which also acted to reduce the overall static pressure recovery of the ducts as their losses increased.

Conventional scale inhibitors used are facing restrictions world over, due to their ecotoxicity and non-biodegradability, {{which has led to}} the call for green scale inhibition in the oil and industry. Due to the inefficiency of the conventional primary and secondary recovery methods to yield above 20 - 40 % OOIP, the need for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) techniques to recover a higher proportion of the Oil Originally in Place (OOIP) has become vital. Alkaline/Surfactant/Polymer (ASP) is one of such techniques and has proven successful due to its ability to raise displacement and sweep efficiency. Despite its popularity as a potentially cost-effective chemical flooding method, it is not without (its) problems, one of which is the excessive formation of silicate scales. Silicate scale is a very serious problem in the oil and gas industry; which forms in perforation holes, <b>casing</b> <b>surface,</b> tubing and surface facilities. During an ASP flood, as the flood progresses into the production well, liquid produced from different layers intermingle, leading to a rapid decrease in the pH value of the mixed waters. Other factors such as temperature, pressure, divalent cations present also play some roles, but pH variation plays the major role. These among other factors facilitate precipitation of silicates and its deposition on tubing, surface pipeline, pumps and surface production facilities resulting in excessive production loss; increasing the average work over periods, which influences the production and causes low commercial effectiveness. Green scale inhibitors are considered as alternative scale inhibitors due to their value-added benefits to the environment with respect to the methods of treating oilfield scales. It is recommended that the industry should shift to the green technology as an alternative scale inhibition method so as to protect the environment...|$|E

The nozzle passage flow field has been measured using a two sensor hot-wire probe at various axial and radial stations. In addition, two component LDV measurements at one axial station (x/c(sum m) = 0. 56) were performed to measure the velocity field. Static pressure measurements and flow visualization, using a fluorescent oil technique, were also performed to obtain the location of transition and the endwall limiting streamlines. A three dimensional boundary layer code, with a simple intermittency transition model, was used to predict the viscous layers along the blade and endwall surfaces. The boundary layers on the blade surface {{were found to be}} very thin and mostly laminar, except on the suction surface downstream of 70 % axial chord. Strong radial pressure gradient, especially close to the suction surface, induces strong cross flow components in the trailing edge regions of the blade. On the end-walls the boundary layers were much thicker, especially near the suction corner of the <b>casing</b> <b>surface,</b> caused by secondary flow. The secondary flow region near the suction-casing surface corner indicates the presence of the passage vortex detached from the blade surface. The corner vortex is found to be very weak. The presence of a closely spaced rotor downstream (20 % of the nozzle vane chord) introduces unsteadiness in the blade passage. The measured instantaneous velocity signal was filtered using FFT square window to remove the periodic unsteadiness introduced by the downstream rotor and fans. The filtering decreased the free stream turbulence level from 2. 1 % to 0. 9 % but had no influence on the computed turbulence length scale.

40|$|The {{top hole}} section in an {{offshore}} well is conventionally drilled riserless utilizing seawater with high viscosity sweeps for cuttings removal. In recent years, {{the possibility of}} eliminating the pilot hole and setting the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> below shallow gas or shallow water flow zones has been investigated. This would allow for setting the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> below potential problem zones, {{so that they do}} not cause problems deeper in the well. Furthermore this could provide sufficient formation strength at the casing shoe, which can open for reducing the number of subsequent casing strings. In order to safely penetrate a shallow gas zone without drilling a pilot hole with dynamic kill possibilities, weighted mud must be utilized when using a conventional top hole drilling system. Owing to {{the fact that this is}} done riserless, which results in huge mud losses to seabed, alternative methods should be considered to avoid the "pump and dump" strategy. Drilling the top hole section whilst circulating the drilling fluid back to the rig can be achieved by utilizing the riserless mud recovery (RMR) system or the low riser return system (LRRS). These new "dual-gradient" systems have a significant benefit in terms of avoiding "pump and dump" when drilling the top hole section. Well barrier designs have been proposed which incorporate techniques and solutions to handling shallow gas with regards to barrier requirements, including procedures for handling the problem of gas trapped between the intermediate <b>casing</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> (trapped annuli). The LRRS system is primarily intended for dual-gradient drilling with a BOP, but can be modified for use in top hole drilling. However, seeing that this system involves utilizing a riser, this system will not be approved for top hole drilling on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). Based on my studies of different techniques of tackling shallow gas in the top hole section, it is found that the RMR system is favorable for eliminating the pilot hole and setting the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> below a shallow gas or shallow water flow zone in a safe and time-efficient manner. The riserless return system enables return of fluid and cuttings in a closed system. Since weighted mud is used the risk of shallow gas influx is reduced compared to conventional riserless drilling. Owing to the fact that the return is routed to the platform, shallow gas is a cause of concern. The existing regulations for drilling on the NCS do not allow for elimination of the pilot hole when shallow gas is expected. However, simulations have shown that the system can detect an influx prior to gas reaching the return line, and also handle the influx in a safe manner. This verifies the feasibility of the RMR system related to safety and well control. </p...|$|R
40|$|Main Body- The {{techniques}} {{used in the}} design of gas lift equipment have faced many challenges over the years. Designs of production wells for lifting oil using low casing pressure lead to cold flow of the extracted fluid. This is because the wells need lower rates of gas lift. It is recommended to use gas lifting pressure in the range of 1120 to 1200 Psi [1]. Producers, who produce lower volumes of oil, require small amounts of gas in order to lift the fluid. They fit gas chokes for controlling the volume of gas lift in gas lift wells. Lower oil production gas volume is small and this leads to a falling in pressure which eventually lowers the temperature of the injected gas that flows down the casing. The reduction in temperature of the <b>casing</b> <b>surfaces</b> results in the cooling of the temperature of the gases in the casing lower than the deeper depths. The low gas temperatures on the <b>surface</b> <b>casing</b> also cool down the temperature of the lifted oil, sometimes to temperatures below the pour point temperature of the surface. This low temperature of the produced crude oil leads to the formation of wax in the production string. The condition is worse in the winter season when the country experiences extreme weather conditions. The condition may exceedingly limit the flow of oil or even plug the oil tubing entirely [2]. As a remedy to this problem, high pressure gas with the potential of raising the temperature in the well need to be introduced. This can be done through the design of wells whereby the oils are lifted at pressures higher than the pour point pressures to prevent wax formation. Chemical treatment may also be adopted. In the chemical treatment procedure, wax inhibitors are injected down the casing together with gas to keep the tubing clean. Another method that {{can be used as a}} remedy is the wire line tools. They are used t...|$|R
