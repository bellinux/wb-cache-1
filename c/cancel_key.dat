5|$|In {{addition}} to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets, which make predefined drawbar combinations {{available at the}} press of a button. Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) {{to the left of}} each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the <b>cancel</b> <b>key,</b> de-activates all presets, and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other preset keys produce preselected drawbar settings that are internally wired into the preset panel.|$|E

50|$|Blackout is a {{particular}} concern for anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems. By exploding a warhead in the upper atmosphere just beyond the range of defensive missiles, an attacker can blanket a wide area of the sky beyond which additional approaching warheads cannot be seen. When those warheads emerge from the blackout area {{there may not be}} enough time for the defensive system to develop tracking information and attack them. This was a serious concern for the LIM-49 Nike Zeus program of the late 1950s, {{and one of the reasons}} it was ultimately <b>canceled.</b> A <b>key</b> discovery revealed in testing was that the effect cleared more quickly for higher frequencies. Later missile defense designs used radars operating at higher frequencies in the UHF and microwave region to mitigate the effect.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, a sharp {{raises the}} pitch of a note one semitone while a flat lowers it one semitone. A natural is used to cancel {{the effect of a}} flat or sharp. This system of accidentals {{operates}} in conjunction with the key signature, whose effect continues throughout an entire piece, unless <b>canceled</b> by another <b>key</b> signature. An accidental {{can also be used to}} cancel a previous accidental or reinstate the flats or sharps of the key signature.|$|R

The club's budget was decreased, planned expenditures were <b>canceled</b> and <b>key</b> players were released. It was later discovered that Shapira's financial status had deteriorated. He had significant debts and his businesses were close to bankruptcy. Some of the club's assets, including player cards, were mortgaged to a Dutch fishing company which Shapira owed money to. On Friday, December 14, 2001, Shapira committed suicide in his house in Nigeria. After his suicide, the court in Haifa ruled that Hapoel Haifa would be administered by a temporary liquidators. At {{the end of that}} season (2001-02), Hapoel was relegated to the second division. For nearly 3 years the club was managed by 3 liquidators, who managed to keep the team in the second division and simultaneously looking for potential purchasers to the club.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} a key {{signature}} continues throughout a piece or movement, unless explicitly <b>cancelled</b> by another <b>key</b> signature. For example, if a five-sharp key signature is placed {{at the beginning of}} a piece, every A in the piece in any octave will be played as A sharp, unless preceded by an accidental (for instance, the A in scale 2 illustrated - the next-to-last note - is played as an A even though the A in the key signature (the last sharp sign) is written an octave lower).|$|R

50|$|The {{popularity}} of this original series peaked in 1965. With a price increase to 15 cents with issue #25 in 1968, {{and a general}} decline in sales in the comic book industry in the late-1960s, Gold <b>Key</b> <b>cancelled</b> the series in 1969 with the final issue being #27. In one of Gold Key's few cross-overs, Doctor Solar re-appeared in the 1975 comic book The Occult Files of Doctor Spektor #14. In the early-1980s, with another industry contraction, Gold Key withdrew from distribution to newsstands and began publishing comics under the Whitman Comics imprint. These were distributed to retail stores (e.g. department stores, toy stores, specialty comic book stores) in poly-bagged packages of three comic books. For this purpose, Doctor Solar, Man of the Atom was restarted at #28 (cover date April 1981) with Roger McKenzie writing and Dan Spiegle drawing. This initiative was short-lived and the series was cancelled again after only four issues.|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{wireless}} communication and its persistent use influences all walks of life. Mobile WiMAX IEEE 802. 16 e standard enabled convergence of mobile and ﬁxed broadband networks through a common wide-area radio-access technology and ﬂexible network architecture. It aims to provide seamless support to its users but an inevitable is that the long delay which occurs during the handoff management in every network process. This paper proposes a Dynamic Interval based Processing Algorithm to separate ping-pong users from the pool of users and to process them separately thus reducing the overhead of network re-entry process. Incoming users are divided into three categories like new user, old user and ping pong user. New user should undergo all the phases of network entry process, old user is provided with authentication key which leads to skipping of steps in generation of keys. Proposed algorithm deals with identifying the ping pong users by calculating the inter arrival duration and rate with same base station. When assured authenticated ping-pong users enter the network next time within the allotted time they will be provided with last used Traffic Encryption Key (TEK) thus bypassing key generation phase. It is observed that the proposed work performs the authentication phase and <b>cancels</b> the <b>key</b> generation phase which leads to minimum network entry delay and it saves to the maximum of 80 % processing time. The network model was developed using Network Simulator and the algorithm was implemented in MATLAB GUIDE which gets connected to the database developed in MYSQL. This approach is justified through its timing analysis result which proves the efficient swift in the handoff processes...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{based on}} a few authors who see power as a {{substantive}} element – instituted power – and others who consider it as an action verb – instituting power (ROCHA, 2007) –, highlighting some types of power relevant in sociological and organizational research on schools, we present empirical data and institutional discourses, enabled by {{a case study of}} qualitative nature. Thus, we can say that relations of power in schools both allow the strengthening of hierarchical and asymmetrical relations of power that exist between institutional players and enable the creation of new “circles of power” that can be promptly activated or can be object of a modernization process held in a more or less generalized manner. This may be reinforced and introduced to players/students, our main target of study, as the most legitimate object, superseding all others but not <b>canceling</b> them. The <b>key</b> objective is to present school organization as a highly complex environment, especially when considered {{in the light of the}} multiple and cumulative relations of power that emerge and are materialized...|$|R
40|$|SDL {{has used}} {{internal}} funds {{to develop a}} prototype low-cost 2 -axis fine steering mirror (FSM) as an enabling technology for smallsats. The FSM has a lightweight high-reflectance mirror, high angular deflection capability for along-track ground motion compensation and cross-track pointing, and a high bandwidth to help <b>cancel</b> unwanted jitter. <b>Key</b> performance parameters areClear aperture, 75 mm; along-track angle, ± 30 deg (mechanical); cross-track angle, ± 60 deg (mechanical); slew rate, greater than 75 deg/sec; bandwidth, 70 Hz; steadystate average error, as good as 1 arcsec; average power dissipation, 0. 4 Watts; and total mechanical mass, 1 kg. The FSM makes use of off-the-shelf components as much as possible. Key components for the along-track (elevation) axis include a rotary voice coil and a unique non-contact feedback sensor. The cross-track (azimuth) axis features a brushless DC motor and a high-resolution optical encoder. Rapid prototyping, autocoding, and real-time hardwarein- the-loop (HIL) testing were used to develop the control algorithms. The cost for the first prototype (including labor and materials) was about $ 200 K...|$|R
40|$|Three pigeons {{were exposed}} to an autoshaping and automaintenance {{procedure}} while a computer-controlled tracking system continuously recorded {{the position of the}} bird's head as it moved freely in the experimental chamber. Although only 2 birds pecked the key during the conditional stimulus (red keylight), all 3 birds exhibited stable patterns of approaching the conditional stimulus and withdrawing from the intertrial stimulus (white keylight). Subsequent exposure to an omission procedure, in which pecks on the red <b>key</b> <b>cancelled</b> the presentation of food upon the termination of the red keylight, greatly reduced key pecking, but approaching and pecking {{in the vicinity of the}} conditional stimulus were maintained at high levels. When the omission contingency was removed key pecking increased. During all phases the birds withdrew from the area of the white key and engaged in repetitive back-and-forth or circuiting movements during this intertrial stimulus. The data document (a) the strong control the conditional stimulus in autoshaping and automaintenance exerts over approach to the key and pecking motions whether or not the conditional stimulus elicits key pecking at a high level; and (b) withdrawal from the vicinity of the key and the occurrence of stereotypic behavior during the intertrial interval...|$|R
