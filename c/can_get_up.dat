The city possesses a microclimate and is considered the region least subject to frosts in all northern Portugal. Cold waves are absent and snowfall is firmly uncommon, the last occurred in January 1986. More recently, snowfall occurred inland. This is due to the winter maritime winds that normally blow from the south and southwest. Most of the rain is concentrated in the winter months, due to the Azores High which influences the subsidence of the air resulting in dry air during the summer.

500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually, forcing Wilson's {{family members}} to devote some {{publishing}} rights to his fee. Landy received 25% of the copyright to all of Wilson's songs, regardless of whether he contributed to them or not, which band manager Tom Hulett explained was an incentive for Landy to reignite Wilson's drive. [...] "It was sort of like, 'Gee, there's nothing coming in now, if you can go make this person well to go create some income...'" [...] Landy expressed similar views. [...] "Saying that [...] in '84 was like me telling you, 'I'll pay you a million dollars if you <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and fly around the room.'" [...] This arrangement was revoked in 1985, with Landy only receiving rights with a percentage equal to his writing contributions. Landy reported that he never received any money, since Wilson had not published any material before the pact was voided.|$|E

500|$|As an {{alternative}} to using tickets, motorists can order a transponder, known as a K-TAG. K-TAG customers can proceed slowly through the toll plaza without stopping to collect a ticket or pay toll. The toll is instead paid through one of two payment plans. K-TAG Classic, intended for frequent turnpike users, requires the customer to maintain a prepaid account, from which funds are drawn as needed. The plan intended for intermittent users, My K-TAG, requires an active credit card. My K-TAG keeps track of the tolls accrued by the customer, and automatically charges the user's credit card monthly. K-TAG Classic accounts are subject to a $1 monthly fee per tag, while My K-TAG account holders <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to five tags for free. Tolls for K-TAG users are lower than for cash customers, so a two-axle vehicle with a K-TAG is charged only $10.20 to travel {{the entire length of}} the turnpike. [...] K-TAG Classic users also receive an additional 10-percent discount on tolls. K-TAGs are available for purchase at select Walgreens, Dillons, and AAA locations.|$|E
