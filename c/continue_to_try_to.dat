500|$|After Lwaxana and Timicin {{spend an}} evening together, {{he tries to}} explain the custom of the Resolution. [...] He tells her that a fixed age had to be {{selected}} by the Kaelons because just randomly choosing a time to die would be heartless. Lwaxana finds the practice barbaric and refuses to accept the Kaelon tradition. [...] She tells Timicin how a Betazed woman on her planet successfully fought the tradition of wearing ornate wigs that contained live, captive birds. [...] It only took one courageous woman {{to step forward and}} end this cruel tradition. [...] Lwaxana also compares Timicin's plans to end his life with his research to save his star. If it is Timicin's time to die, Lwaxana argues, perhaps it is also time for his star to die as well, so why should he <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> prevent it? Timicin thinks about what Lwaxana has told him.|$|E

500|$|On 21 April 2010, the Russian Supreme Court {{ordered the}} Moscow City Court {{to hear an}} appeal in an ongoing Katyn legal case. A civil rights group, Memorial, said the ruling {{could lead to a}} court {{decision}} to open up secret documents providing details about the killings of thousands of Polish officers. On 8 May 2010, Russia handed over to Poland 67 volumes from [...] "criminal case No. 159", launched in the 1990s to investigate the Soviet-era mass killings of Polish officers. Copies of these volumes, each comprising about 250 pages, were packed in six boxes.

2500|$|On 8 October Asquith {{wrote to}} Law {{suggesting}} an informal {{meeting of the}} two party leaders, which Law accepted. The two met at Cherkley Court, the home of Law's ally Sir Max Aitken MP (later Lord Beaverbrook), on 14 October. The meeting lasted an hour, and Law told Asquith that he would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> have Parliament dissolved, and that in any ensuing election the Unionists would accept the result even if it went against them. Law later expressed his fear to Lansdowne that Asquith would persuade the Irish Nationalists to accept Home Rule with the exclusion of four Ulster counties. Carson would not accept this, requiring all six counties to be excluded, and such a move might split the Unionists. Law knew that Asquith was unlikely to consent to a general election, since he would almost certainly lose it, and that any attempt to pass the Home Rule Bill [...] "without reference to the electorate" [...] would lead to civil disturbance. As such, Asquith was stuck [...] "between {{a rock and a}} hard place" [...] and was sure to negotiate.|$|E
