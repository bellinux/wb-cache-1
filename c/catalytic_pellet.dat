40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the development of}} pure and lanthanum doped tin dioxide catalytic pellets in detecting ethanol vapour prepared by sol-gel method and pressed into pellet. Sintering treatment at 500 °C was carried out for 4 h. Structural characterization was performed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM) and BET surface area analyzer. The results of structural analysis showed that lanthanum has been successfully incorporated into the SnO 2 crystal lattice. The catalytic pellets gas sensing performance revealed that {{the sensitivity of the}} sensor is improved by the addition of lanthanum. The linear dependence of the sensitivity on the ethanol vapour concentration is observed in the range of 800 - 3000 ppm. The maximum sensitivity is exhibited by 10 at. % La-SnO 2 <b>catalytic</b> <b>pellet</b> at operating temperature of 300 °C. The response and recovery time are increased by introduction of lanthanum into tin oxide.

40|$|Abstract – This {{contribution}} {{focuses on}} the scaling aspects in the learning of catalytic reactions in pores and pellets. The idea is to identify a systematic approach {{in the learning process}} to help students with several concepts related to transport-reactions process and the mathematical description associated with them. Items that {{are at the heart of}} the contribution is the integration between math concepts with the physics of the system, the learning of micro and macro levels, and avoiding story telling approaches that are usually utilized in the classical textbooks. In addition, the approach highlights the role of the <b>catalytic</b> <b>pellet</b> as an effective POK introduced by Arce (1994) in learning multiple scales systems. The proposed approach uses a microscopic formulation and an area-averaging process with a closure procedure...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a {{consistent}} mathematical model to simulate a spherical <b>catalytic</b> <b>pellet</b> and a Packed-Bed Reactor (PBR) is develop. The Dusty Gas Model (DGM) {{is applied to}} the calculation of the diffusive fluxes in the porous media. Simulations are executed considering hydrogen production from steam methane reforming. Species’ diffusivities are calculated using data from literature as well as the values for tortuosity and porosity. The pellet simulation is performed considering mass, species, momentum and energy conservation equations, while the PBR model considers constant temperature along the reactor. The simulations are performed at a variety of temperatures, and results are presented in terms of species’ production/consumption along the pellet radius and reactor length. The effectiveness factor for each species along the reactor length is determined and results are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Sensors used in explosimeters for the {{detection}} of explosive gases are generally catalytic. The most widespread are <b>catalytic</b> <b>pellets.</b> A metallic oxidation catalyst is heated to a sufficiently high temperature to oxidize the gas. The oxidation reaction increases the temperature of the catalyst which increases its electrical resistance, whose amplitude is proportional to the gas concentration. In the 1950 s we developed a sensor of this type for the mining industry. It was based on a platinum filament and destined to detect methane, responsible for mine explosions. The filament is distinguished from the <b>catalytic</b> <b>pellets</b> by its operating temperature: 1000 °C instead of 600 °C, which confers on it the advantage of being relatively insensitive to fouling and catalyst poisoning. The disadvantage, however, is rapid wear, preventing it from operating permanently. The measurement technique thus involves energizing the sensor just long enough to make the measurement and then turning it off {{for as long as the}} application permits. The first instruments of this time could run for 100, 000 measurements, or about 9 months at the rhythm of one measurement every 4 minutes. By improving the filament heating technique, the measurement capacity has been increased considerably: 10, 000, 000 measurements with the last methanemeter recently marketed, or a lifetime of 1. 5 years at the practically continuous measurement rhythm of once every 5 seconds. Endowed with these performance characteristics, the platinum filament sensor is today a reliable solution for explosimetry, in particular in environments polluted with certain catalyst poisons such as sulfur-containing products, which other catalytic sensors resist poorly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Concentration {{gradients}} ina partially liquid-tilled (unsaturated) porous body induce countercurrent gas {{and liquid}} flows which in their turn greatly influence {{the rate of}} the reactant transport. The origin of these convective flows is demonstrated starting with an elementary capillary circuit and passing to regular and random partially-filled porous media. The equations describing the mass transfer, reaction and balance of the pore filling in an unsaturated porous body are formulated and analysed. The qualitative estimates show that the gas-phase diffusion may play major ole in smoothing out concentration gradients ina reacting liquid, and that under usual conditions the capillary forces in an unsaturated porous body with a wide distribution ofpore sizes are strong enough to maintain the uniform hlhng throughout the partially-filled <b>catalytic</b> <b>pellet.</b> As an example of the quantitative solution of the basic set of equations, a simple reaction in a volatile liquid is considered; the results obtained show considerable acceleration f the diffusion-controlled reaction due to convective transport in an unsaturated porous medium. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Microdischarges in {{spatially}} confined geometries, such as microcavities and micropores {{of various}} materials, present a promising method for the generation {{and maintenance of}} stable discharges at atmospheric pressure. They have been successfully used in many biomedical, environmental and industrial applications. The paper presents two relatively new types of discharges in confined volumes – a capillary microdischarge in ceramic foams and a sliding discharge inside the capillaries of ceramic honeycombs – and describes their basic physical properties and mechanisms. Microdischarges inside the microporous ceramic foams develop from the surface barrier discharge if the amplitude of the applied voltage reaches given threshold, {{but only for a}} specific pore size. Sliding discharge inside the honeycomb capillaries is produced by a combination of AC barrier discharge inside <b>catalytic</b> <b>pellet</b> bed coupled in series with DC powered honeycomb monolith. Both discharges produce relatively cold microplasmas with high level of non-equilibrium. The basic characteristics of the microdischarges, addressing the effects of the applied voltage, discharge power, pore size, length and diameter of the capillaries are discussed.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{combined}} evaporation of the liquid phase and reaction on single catalyst pellet performance has been studied experimentally. The exothermic, catalyzed hydrogenation of α-methylstyrene (AMS) to cumene has been employed as a model reaction. Steady state and dynamic experiments have been performed in a single <b>catalytic</b> <b>pellet</b> reactor using five catalytic pellets of different porous structures, thermal conductivity, apparent catalytic activity and distribution of catalyst in the pellet. Gas-phase temperature, concentration of AMS in the gas phase and the liquid flow rates have been varied. The measured center and surface temperatures of each pellet reveal the existence of two significantly different steady states {{in the range of}} liquid flow rate. The range of the liquid flow rate over which the two steady states were observed, the pellet temperature and the pellet dynamics depend strongly on the amount of AMS vapor in the gas phase and the catalyst properties. The obtained experimental data are helpful to elucidate the mechanism of hot-spot formation and runaway in multiphase fixed-bed reactors...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} an {{industrial}} Biomass-To-Liquid (BTL) plant simulation and optimization are presented. Biomass is first gasified with oxygen and steam, and the produced syngas {{is fed to a}} multi-tubular {{fixed bed reactor}} for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, obtaining a distribution of hydrocarbons with different molecular weight. A simplified model for the biomass gasification section is implemented in HYSYS® V 8. 4, while the Fischer-Tropsch reactor is simulated using MATLAB® R 2013 a. The kinetic parameters of the FT reaction have been determined by using a non-liner regression performed with the experimenta data obtained with a bench-scale FT-rig. The model developed for the Fischer-Tropsch reactor takes into account the <b>catalytic</b> <b>pellet's</b> effectiveness factor and the eventual formation of a liquid phase in each point along reactor’s axial coordinate.

40|$|The present work {{is related}} to the {{development}} of sustainable energy systems based on the Power-to-Gas concept. The main objective is to utilise renewable hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce methane for storage in the natural gas infrastructure. Multitubular fixed-bed reactors are established at industrial scale for CO 2 methanation. <b>Catalytic</b> <b>pellets</b> commonly loaded in this type of reactor involve poor heat transfer and high pressure drop that lead to inefficient processes. Today, reaction engineers focus their research on the branch of process intensification. Highlighted features of intensified reactors are improved heat and mass transfer, product efficiency, and reduced size. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland is developing a technology in methods by washcoating and nanocoating. The aim of this work was to determine the suitability of these novel catalysts for CO 2 methanation, and the optimal operation conditions that favour their performance. Washcoated and nanocoated catalysts were tested in laboratory scale and compared with conventional packed-bed catalysts. The reactors were loaded with nickel-based catalysts and operated at three different temperatures (350, 400, and 5000 C) and three different flow rates (0. 7, 1. 0 and 1. 3 ln/min), H 2 :CO 2 = 4, and at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst bulk density of washcoated reactors was significantly lower than in packed-bed reactors. As a result, the washcoated catalysts performed better due to more efficient heat transfer and temperature control. Carbon dioxide conversion equal to 69 % and 99 % methane selectivity were obtained with the washcoat with highest nickel content at 4100 C. The good results obtained with washcoated reactors encourage the development of these reactors into scaled-up configurations. Conversely, nanocoated catalysts exhibited lower performance. Nevertheless, the possibility of developing active catalysts minimizing the content of active phase motivates further research on the nanocoating technology...|$|R
40|$|Oregon woodstove National Emissions Inventory (NEI) {{estimates}} {{have been}} elevated compared to neighboring states {{and most other}} areas of the country. This paper outlines the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality’s approach for estimating the 2002 annual residential wood combustion emissions by county; the method detailed here is a refinement of the DEQ NEI submittal, and reflects the most recent changes in EPA emission factor and heating device apportionment data. Two separate statewide surveys, completed in 1993 and 2000, were used to determine wood heating activity. A large component of the methodology consisted of estimating the mass of cord wood burned per housing unit for different areas in Oregon. An additional challenge was in calculating the distribution and number of wood burning device types by housing unit. Wood burning devices for the inventory include conventional, <b>catalytic,</b> <b>pellet,</b> and non-catalytic woodstoves, as well as fireplaces. Emission factors used are from a variety of sources, including AP- 42, EIIP, OMNI Environmental Services, and the 2002 NEI documentation. Estimated results show that statewide 2002 residential wood combustion emissions were approximately 44, 256 tons PM 2. 5; 216, 121 tons VOC; 295, 224 tons CO; and 4, 513 tons of NOX.

40|$|M. Sc. (Applied Mathematics) A {{comparison}} between the recently developed spectral relaxation method (SRM) and the spectral local linearisation method (SLLM) is done {{for the first time}} in this work. Both spectral hybrid methods are employed in finding the solution to the non isothermal mass and heat balance model of a <b>catalytic</b> <b>pellet</b> boundary value problem (BVP) with finite mass and heat transfer resistance, which is a coupled system of singular nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The SRM and the SLLM are applied, for the first time, to solve a problem with singularities. The solution by the SRM and the SLLM are validated against the results by bvp 4 c, a well known matlab built-in procedure for solving BVPs. Tables and graphs are used to show the comparison. The SRM and the SLLM are exceptionally accurate with the SLLM being the fastest to converge to the correct solution. We then construct a new spectral hybrid method which we named the spectral Adomian decomposition method (SADM). The SADM is used concurrently with the standard Adomian decomposition method (ADM) to solve well known models arising in fluid mechanics. These problems are the magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) Jeffery-Hamel flow model and the Darcy-Brinkman- Forchheimer momentum equations. The validity of the results by the SADM and ADM are verified by the exact solution and bvp 4 c solution where applicable. A simple alteration of the SADM is made to improve the performance...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{performances}} of a tube-shell staged membrane reactor (SMR) for methane steam reforming are analyzed by computer modelling in terms of methane conversion, hydrogen recovery factor and hydrogen recovery yield. The internal tube (the permeate side) {{is represented by the}} Pd-alloy membrane, whereas the reaction occurs in the packed bed retentate side. The staged membrane reactor is composed of several reactive and inert stages laid out in alternative series and filled with <b>catalytic</b> and inert <b>pellets,</b> respectively. For this analysis, a 1 -D model including momentum, energy and mass transfer is used. Its validation was already performed by means of experimental data taken from literature (Caravella et al., 2008). In particular, the specific topic of the investigation {{is the role of the}} number of reactive and inert stages and of the amount of catalyst, comparing the obtained results with those of the conventional membrane reactor (MR). A very significant result of the analysis is that an SMR with a sufficiently high number of stages can reach performances very close to those of the MR with a significantly smaller amount of catalyst (up to 70 % lower) for all the temperatures considered. As a consequence, the amount of saved catalyst can be evaluated, relating it to the performance losses with respect to the conventional MR and providing a qualitative and quantitative rule to exploit efficiently the catalyst. 1...|$|R
