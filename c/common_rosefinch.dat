40|$|Migratory birds, {{some small}} and light weight as matchboxes, engage in {{seasonal}} inter-continental journeys {{in order to}} take advantage of the long summer days and abundance of food at northern latitudes to breed and raise their young, and then escape the harsh winters by migrating to lower latitudes. This thesis deals with two important aspects of migration, the routes taken during migration and the birds’ behaviour at stopovers. The migratory routes are for many species unknown, whole or in part, and this is especially true for species that migrate nocturnally. At stopovers birds replenish fuel reserves that powers migratory flight, and studying how birds utilise stopovers is important in order to understand how migration is organised. In this thesis I have used modern tracking technology to study both continental wide movements of thrush nightingales (Luscinia luscinia) and <b>common</b> <b>rosefinches</b> (Carpodacus erythrinus) using small light-level geolocators, and smaller scale movements at a single stopover site of garden warblers (Sylvia borin) using miniature radio-transmitters. I have also studied the fuelling behaviour of garden warblers during autumn migration in the field and in the lab, and great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) at a stopover site on Crete during spring migration after the Sahara crossing. The thesis discusses the significance of several aspects of migration shown by the birds that would have been very difficult to detect without the aid of modern tracking technology, such as loop migration, prolonged stops during migration, multiple wintering sites, and nocturnal relocations at stopover sites. Studies carried out at stopover sites also show that garden warblers and great reed warblers can attain large fuel loads even at sites where they have no barrier to cross and this might be a result of good foraging conditions. The thesis also highlights the importance of combining different techniques when studying stopover behaviour to get reliable estimates on stopover durations and fuel deposition rates as well as the importance of choosing sites preferred by birds when planning stopover studies.

40|$|A {{scattergram}} of wing length against {{tail length}} (Fig. 1) indicates clearly that CTNRC 53 - 1963 clusters with <b>Common</b> <b>Rosefinch,</b> {{rather than with}} either Pink-rumped or Beautiful Rosefinch. The wing:tail ratio was 1. 5. This compares with a ratio of 1. 36 – 1. 67 for other <b>Common</b> <b>Rosefinch</b> examined (n = 29); 1. 18 – 1. 21 for the short-winged, relatively long-tailed Pink-rumped Rosefinch (n = 4) and 1. 17 – 1. 33 (n = 8) for nominate Pink-rumped Rosefinch which is somewhat intermediate. Conclusion The addition of Pink-rumped Rosefinch to the Thai faunal list {{on the basis of}} specimen CTNRC 53 - 1963 cannot be sustained. The specimen instead appears to be a small, well-marked example of <b>Common</b> <b>Rosefinch.</b> Its size and stronger markings, distinguishing it from other <b>Common</b> <b>Rosefinch</b> in CTNRC, are doubtless the reason why the record remain unquestioned for so long; nevertheless, CTNRC 53 - 1963 remains a closer fit to <b>Common</b> <b>Rosefinch</b> than any other rosefinch of the region. Speculation as to the subspecific identity of this specimen is outside the scope of this note and, in view of the great variability of Common Rosefinches, may not be possible to resolve. Both C. e. erythrinus and C. e. roseatus are listed for Thailand by Deignan (1963), and the range of variation in C. e. roseatus, in particular, should be examined. Additionally, females of the north-east Siberian race C. e. grebnitskii are said to be ‘darker, greyer and browner, and more heavily streaked ’ (Vaurie 1959) and might be a better fit. Indeed, P. R. Sweet (in litt.) thought the photographs of the specimen were a good match for C. e. grebnitskii. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Mark Adams (BMNH) for arranging access to specimen...|$|E

The phylogeography of three widespread Palearctic passerines were characterized in this dissertation based on sequence data from mitochondrial and nuclear genes, which were analyzed under {{a framework of}} the coalescence. The following questions were addressed: (1) does gene history reflect species history, (2) does natural selection on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) obscure phylogeographic inference, and (3) do {{the early stages of}} speciation reveal ecological niche divergence. In chapter one, phylogeographic histories based on mtDNA and 13 nuclear genes of Eurasian nuthatches (Sitta europaea) were compared to address an ongoing debate over the value of mtDNA in phylogeography. Both mtDNA and multilocus nuclear data recovered the same three clades. The results suggested that mtDNA is efficient in discovering phylogeographic pattern due to its fast coalescence rate; whereas, multiple (nuclear) genes are required to quantify process parameters such as effective population size, gene flow and divergence time. In chapter two, I devised novel methods based on coalescent simulations to discover whether natural selection has influenced the mitochondrial genome of two Old World flycatcher species (Ficedula parva and F. albicilla). The simulations were based on the estimated demographic history using 18 nuclear genes, which suggested that the two sister species diverged around three million years ago and that F. albicilla, but not F. parva, experienced a recent population expansion. My analyses showed that population bottlenecks alone could not fully explain the strikingly low variation in the mtDNA data, and I concluded that the mtDNA patterns were affected by natural selection. Thus, interpreting the phylogeographic history based solely on mtDNA can be misleading. Chapter three involved coalescence and simulation approaches based on mtDNA and a Z-linked gene to explore the early stages of evolutionary divergence in the <b>common</b> <b>rosefinch</b> (Carpodacus erythrinus). The third chapter also involved an assessment of ecological niche divergence and the results showed no evidence of ecological divergence at the early stages of diversification among three rosefinch lineages. This dissertation demonstrates that the incorporation of multiple genes, coalescence theory, and analytic approaches from other fields (e. g., ecological niche modeling) can provide fresh insights into phylogeographic history of species...|$|E
