5|$|Beginning in 1524, Bucer {{concentrated}} on the main issue dividing leading reformers, the eucharist. In this dispute, he attempted to mediate between Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli. The two theologians disagreed on whether the body and blood of Christ were physically present within the elements of bread and wine during {{the celebration of the}} Lord's Supper. Luther believed in a <b>corporeal</b> or physical real presence of Christ; and Zwingli believed Christ's body and blood where made present by the Holy Spirit. By late 1524, Bucer had abandoned the idea of <b>corporeal</b> real presence and, after some exegetical studies, accepted Zwingli's interpretation. However, he did not believe the Reformation depended on either position but on faith in Christ, other matters being secondary. In this respect he differed from Zwingli.|$|E
5|$|Cranmer's eucharistic views, {{which had}} already moved away from {{official}} Catholic doctrine, received another push from Continental reformers. Cranmer had {{been in contact with}} Martin Bucer since the time when initial contacts were made with the Schmalkaldic League. However, Cranmer and Bucer's relationship became ever closer due to Charles V's victory over the League at Mühlberg, which left England as the sole major nation that gave sanctuary to persecuted reformers. Cranmer wrote a letter to Bucer (now lost) with questions on eucharistic theology. In Bucer's reply dated 28 November 1547, he denied the <b>corporeal</b> real presence and condemned transubstantiation and the adoration of the elements. The letter was delivered to Cranmer by two Italian reformed theologians, Peter Martyr and Bernardino Ochino who were invited to take refuge in England. Martyr also brought with him an epistle written allegedly by John Chrysostom (now regarded as a forgery), Ad Caesarium Monachum, which appeared to provide patristic support against the <b>corporeal</b> real presence. These documents were to influence Cranmer's thoughts on the eucharist.|$|E
5|$|Humans are <b>corporeal</b> beings and, as such, {{they are}} subject to {{examination}} and description by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings {{play an important role in}} the philosophy of mind. There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: biology, computer science, cognitive science, cybernetics, linguistics, medicine, pharmacology, and psychology.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to earlier}} works of this type, Christ's body is more {{physically}} <b>corporeal,</b> {{depicted as a}} real object, and his anatomy more closely rendered. His hands and feet seem to extend beyond the pictorial space, which is delineated by the flat, coloured borders of the cross, in turn made up of at least six boards. Both Christ's body and his semi-circular nimbus are placed at angles which rise outwards and above {{the level of the}} cross.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, Ask and Embla (from Old Norse Askr ok Embla)—male {{and female}} respectively—were {{the first two}} humans, created by the gods. The pair are attested in both the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, three gods, {{one of whom is}} Odin, find Ask and Embla and bestow upon them various <b>corporeal</b> and spiritual gifts. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the two figures, and there are occasional references to them in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} {{that this man}} is the actual, <b>corporeal</b> Prismo, and the version Finn and Jake are familiar with is merely a dream. Prismo explains that killing a wishmaster—as in, waking up the man—is a cosmic crime, but that he will return when his corporal body falls back asleep. At that instant, the Lich springs into action, physically waking and destroying Prismo, killing him. Suddenly, an interdimensional being arrives and begins taking the Lich to the Citadel, to which Finn and Jake give chase.|$|E
5|$|As {{the use of}} English in worship {{services}} spread, {{the need for a}} complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the Book of Common Prayer were held in the former abbey of Chertsey and in Windsor Castle in September 1548. The list of participants can only be partially reconstructed, but it is known that the members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned the doctrine of the <b>corporeal</b> real presence and believed that the Eucharistic presence was only spiritual. Parliament backed the publication of the Prayer Book after Christmas by passing the Act of Uniformity 1549; it then legalized clerical marriage.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him <b>corporeal</b> again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E
5|$|The speech bubble {{makes the}} entire canvas {{relevant}} by broadening {{the attention to}} the entire width of the painting and the curves of the bubble unite the narrative with several of the picture's other graphical elements. Lichtenstein has added color, including all of the primary colors, while transforming the original and making reference to mechanical reproduction via Ben-Day dots. Like Look Mickey, {{there is reason to}} describe this image as a self-portrait of sorts. The subject is extending a finger through a circular opening, which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. An alternative self-representation is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a doubt in this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the <b>corporeal</b> is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin.|$|E
5|$|The Kurma Purana narrates {{that during}} a {{particular}} council of rishis (sages), the god Brahma arrogantly {{declared that he}} was the Supreme Creator of the Universe. Shiva appeared at the assembly as an infinite pillar of light and challenged Brahma's statement. After deliberation, the council accepted Shiva as the true Creator, but Brahma remained obstinate. Angered by Brahma's vanity, Shiva—as the terrifying Bhairava—cut off one head of the five-headed Brahma with a mere flick of his fingernail (an act iconographically depicted as Brahmashirascheda-murti). As a consequence Brahma died, but the spiritual credit he had accumulated over a lifetime of devout asceticism pulled him immediately back from death. Upon his resurrection, Brahma accepted Shiva's superiority. The reason for the decapitation of Brahma remains the same in the narratives of the Shiva Purana and the Matsya Purana. In the Skanda Purana, the trigger is not Brahma's arrogance but his incest with his daughter, while in the Bengali version of the Shiva Purana, Brahma insults Shiva using his fifth head's mouth, while the rest of them praise Shiva when he comes to Brahma's abode as a guest. In another instance in the Shiva Purana, when an argument erupts between Brahma and Vishnu over who is superior, Shiva appears as an infinite fiery pillar (Linga) in front of the pair. They decide whoever finds the end of the pillar is superior. Brahma lies about finding the head of the infinite pillar and declares himself as superior. In the Varaha Purana, in which Shiva is born from Brahma's brow, Brahma calls his son a Kapali and angers him. In all versions, an infuriated Shiva or Bhairava cuts off Brahma's head as a punishment. However, all Puranas (Kurma, Varaha, Shiva, Skanda, and Vamana) agree that the head of Brahma stuck to Bhairava-Shiva's left palm due to the sin of killing Brahma, the most learned Brahmin – Brahmahatya or Brahminicide. To expiate the sin of brahmahatya, Shiva had to perform the vow of a Kapali: wandering the world as a naked beggar with the skull of the slain as his begging bowl. In the Kurma and Vamana Puranas, Shiva's sin takes <b>corporeal</b> form, becoming a ghoulish woman called Brahmahatya who follows Bhikshatana everywhere he goes.|$|E

25|$|Official {{writings}} of the churches of the Anglican Communion have consistently affirmed Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, a term that includes {{a belief in the}} <b>corporeal</b> presence, the sacramental union, as well as several other eucharistic theologies.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the human}} soul, his {{epistemological}} theory required that, since the knower becomes what he knows, {{the soul is}} definitely not corporeal—if it is <b>corporeal</b> when it knows what some <b>corporeal</b> thing is, that thing would come to be within it. Therefore, the soul has an operation which does not rely on a body organ, and therefore the soul can exist without a body. Furthermore, since the rational soul of human beings is a subsistent form and not something made of matter and form, it cannot be destroyed in any natural process. The full argument for the immortality of the soul and Aquinas' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the Summa Theologica.|$|E
25|$|The Avesta's {{identification}} of Airyaman with Asha Vahishta (→ MP Ardavahisht) is carried forward into Zoroastrian tradition. In Denkard 8.37.13, Airyaman's role as healer is even shared with Asha Vahishta: While Airyaman {{is responsible for}} <b>corporeal</b> health, Asha Vahishta is responsible for spiritual health.|$|E

25|$|Dreyfus's seminal {{critique}} of cognitivism (or the computational {{account of the}} mind), What Computers Can't Do, consciously replays Merleau-Ponty's {{critique of}} intellectualist psychology to argue for the irreducibility of <b>corporeal</b> know-how to discrete, syntactic processes. Through the influence of Dreyfus's critique and neurophysiological alternative, Merleau-Ponty became associated with neurophysiological, connectionist accounts of cognition.|$|E
25|$|The book {{begins with}} Maimonides’ thesis against anthropomorphism. In the Bible, {{one can find}} many {{expressions}} that refer to God in human terms, for instance the “hand of God”.

25|$|Although {{extension}} in quantitative parts follows upon a <b>corporeal</b> nature, nevertheless {{it is not}} {{the same}} for a body to be a substance and for it to be quantified. For of itself substance is indivisible, not indeed as a point is indivisible, but as that which falls outside the order of dimensions is indivisible. But quantity, which gives the substance extension, really differs from the substance and is truly an accident.|$|E

25|$|Generally speaking, {{human remains}} are best {{preserved}} in cool, dark, dry conditions while wrapped in acid-free (non-buffered) tissue and packing materials. <b>Corporeal</b> materials {{should not be}} stored in or near any wood or in any containers which previously housed wood due to potentially increased lignin levels, which produce an acid {{that can lead to}} the deterioration of DNA and proteins in the remains. Excessive exposure to light should be avoided in order to prevent bleaching of materials, especially bone.|$|E
25|$|He {{recognised}} no activity without motion, and so referred {{all activities}} of the soul to motion: the desires and emotions to <b>corporeal</b> motion, judgment (kriseis) and contemplation to spiritual motion. The idea of a spirit entirely independent of organic activity, must therefore have appeared to him very doubtful; yet {{he appears to have}} contented himself with developing his doubts and difficulties on the point, without positively rejecting it. Other Peripatetics, like Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus, and especially Strato, developed further this naturalism in Aristotelian doctrine.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} {{for this new}} interpretation of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection {{are found in the}} epistles of Paul and in the Book of Acts. Most Jews view Paul as the founder of Christianity, who is responsible for the break with Judaism. Recently, Talmud scholar Daniel Boyarin has argued that Paul's theology of the spirit is more deeply rooted in Hellenistic Judaism than generally believed. In A Radical Jew Boyarin argues that Paul the Apostle combined the life of Jesus with Greek philosophy to reinterpret the Hebrew Bible in terms of the Platonic opposition between the ideal (which is real) and the material (which is false); see also Paul the Apostle and Judaism. Judaism is a <b>corporeal</b> religion, in which membership is based not on belief but rather descent from Abraham, physically marked by circumcision, and focusing on how to live this life properly. Paul saw in the symbol of a resurrected Jesus the possibility of a spiritual rather than <b>corporeal</b> messiah. He used this notion of messiah to argue for a religion through which all people — not just descendants of Abraham — could worship the God of Abraham. Unlike Judaism, which holds that it is the proper religion only of the Jews, Pauline Christianity claimed to be the proper religion for all people.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} 'Black Rubric' in the 1552 Prayer Book {{which allowed}} kneeling for communion but denied {{the real and}} essential presence of Christ in the elements was omitted in the 1559 edition. It was re-instated in the 1662 Book modified to deny any <b>corporeal</b> presence to suggest Christ was present in his natural Body. The bread and wine are held to be outward symbols of an inward and spiritual grace received by the faithful as the instruments of God's grace and Jesus' self-offering to the communicant.|$|E
25|$|Though {{disagreement}} {{regarding the}} exact details {{and timing of}} the event has persisted, with Maimonides suggesting {{that it will take}} place after the inauguration of the Messianic kingdom and without the involvement of <b>corporeal</b> bodies, belief in the resurrection has remained an important factor in Jewish eschatology. In the Late Middle Ages, belief in the resurrection of the dead became a firmly established part of Jewish Orthodoxy, codified as the last of Maimonides' thirteen principles of faith. It is the subject of multiple prayers in the daily Jewish liturgy, including in the Elohai Neshamah and in the second benediction of the Amidah.|$|E
25|$|Knollys' strong Protestant {{convictions}} recommended him to {{the young}} king and to his sister the Princess Elizabeth, and he spent much time at court, taking a prominent part not only in tournaments there, but also in religious discussion. On 25 November 1551 he was present at Sir William Cecil's house, at a conference between several Catholics and Protestants respecting the <b>corporeal</b> presence in the Sacrament. About the same date he was granted the manors of Caversham in Oxfordshire (now Berkshire) and Cholsey in Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). At the end of 1552 he visited Ireland on public business.|$|E
25|$|Many Jewish {{scholars}} such as Rabbi Saadia Gaon, Rabbi Bahya ibn Paquda, and Rabbi Yehuda Halevi have elaborated on {{the issues}} of idolatry. One of the oft-cited discussions is the commentary of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) on idolatry. According to the Maimonidean interpretation, idolatry in itself is not a fundamental sin, but the grave sin is the belief that God can be <b>corporeal.</b> In the Jewish belief, the only image of God is man, one who lives and thinks; God has no visible shape, and it is absurd to make or worship images; instead man must worship the invisible God alone.|$|E
25|$|The sunni {{scholar and}} sufi mystic Ibn Arabi stated the angels {{are the first}} beings created and {{distinguished}} between angels of the <b>corporeal</b> and the incorporeal world, called Al-Ama (the cloud), there all of the creation will be created. In this place, angelic beings dwelled {{in the presence of}} God, but are unable to recognize each other or even themselves, until God elected one of them, to become the Higher Pen writing, everything God will create in the cosmos. The angels in the <b>corporeal</b> world are more akin to the humans than in the majority Islamic view. Accordingly, angels are spirits blown into light, while humans are spirits blown into shape, and jinn spirits blown into wind (wind is referring to the hot air, discharged from the flame called marijin min nar, from which the jinn are created according to the Quran). Humans are even superior to the angels, because angels can just follow straight lines, therefore they can function as forces of nature and perform specific tasks but are unable to know Gods names, attributes or to perceive God in different ways like humans can do. Angels hesitated to bow before Adam, because they were unable to see the true nature of human. Some angels erred in believing their way of perceiving God is the only way, and they become guilty of opposing Adam as a vice regent and fixing on one interpretation of God to the exclusion of others.|$|E
25|$|Theophrastus {{introduced}} his Physics with the proof that all natural existence, being <b>corporeal</b> and composite, requires principles, and first and foremost, motion, {{as the basis}} of all change. Denying the substance of space, he seems to have regarded it, in opposition to Aristotle, as the mere arrangement and position (taxis and thesis) of bodies. Time he called an accident of motion, without, it seems, viewing it, with Aristotle, as the numerical determinant of motion. He attacked the doctrine of the four classical elements and challenged whether fire could be called a primary element when it appears to be compound, requiring, as it does, another material for its own nutriment.|$|E
25|$|Hasheesh {{is indeed}} an accursed drug, {{and the soul}} at last pays a most bitter price for all its ecstasies; moreover, the use of {{it is not the}} proper means of gaining any insight, yet who shall say that at that season of exaltation I did not know things as they are more truly than ever in the {{ordinary}} state?.... In the jubilance of hashish, we have only arrived by an improper pathway at the secret of that infinity of beauty which shall be beheld in heaven and earth when the veil of the <b>corporeal</b> drops off, and we know as we are known.|$|E
25|$|When Warlock acquires the Infinity Gauntlet, he expels {{good and}} evil from his soul, unintentionally giving them <b>corporeal</b> forms. The evil half names himself the Magus and {{attempts}} to gain the Infinity Gauntlet for himself. He fails, and Warlock traps him in the Soul Gem. Since he {{is only part of}} a soul, he cannot interact with the other inhabitants of Soul World and exists only as a phantom. The Magus escapes the Soul Gem in an immaterial form, absorbing the life energies of others to regain tangibility. He is defeated by Genis-Vell and reverts to an ethereal entity. The Magus retaliates by wounding Genis' friend Moondragon and claiming she is destined to become his slave.|$|E
25|$|As a writer, {{poetry is}} {{basically}} Changmarín's fundamental tool of expression. Once {{established as a}} consecrated poet, he reached an outstanding moment in his creation with the book of poetry entitled Poemas Corporales (<b>Corporeal</b> Poems), which was awarded the Ricardo Miró National Award in 1955. With this work, Changmarín showed himself as a developed poet who has achieved great control over this literary form. Changmarín leaves {{out as much as}} possible, which mirrors the trends of the time. This clarity serves as a method to deliver the social and political messages, as most of his works are fundamental. His mastery of the decasyllable writing imprints Poemas Corporales with a classical accent comparable to the Quevedo Verses.|$|E
25|$|Another famous {{philosophy}} is that formulated by Nachman of Breslov and adhered to by Breslov Hasidim. In contrast {{to most of}} his peers who believed God must be worshiped through joy, Nachman portrayed the <b>corporeal</b> world in grim colors, as a place devoid of God's immediate presence from which the soul yearns to liberate itself. He mocked the attempts to perceive the nature of infinite-finite dialectics {{and the manner in}} which God still occupies the Vacant Void albeit not, stating these were paradoxical, beyond human understanding. Only naive faith in their reality would do. Mortals were in constant struggle to overcome their profane instincts, and had to free themselves from their limited intellects to see the world as it truly is.|$|E
25|$|Carpentier's El reino de este mundo (1949) {{highlights}} the Haitian Revolution of the 18th century when the African slaves fought the French colonists for their freedom and basic human rights. The novel combines not only historical references {{of the event}} with aspects of African faith and rituals, most notably Haitian vodou; but also the connections between <b>corporeal</b> and spiritual self. The story is seen {{through the eyes of}} the protagonist Ti Noël, a black slave. Being a white, European/Cuban writer who published on the subject of the Haitian Revolution, it has been implied that Carpentier chose to write from Ti Noël's point of view so that he would avoid being criticized for any racial stereotyping. Carpentier incorporates symbolic architecture throughout the novel; representing the dictatorship of colonial rule with structures such as the Sans-Souci Palace and the fortress of La Ferrière.|$|E
