25|$|Though the FQIS {{itself was}} {{designed}} to prevent danger by minimizing voltages and currents, the innermost tube of Flight 800's FQIS compensator showed damage {{similar to that of}} the compensator tube identified as the ignition source for the surge tank fire that destroyed a 747 near Madrid in 1976. This was not considered proof of a source of ignition. Evidence of arcing was found in a wire bundle that included FQIS wiring connecting to the center wing tank. Arcing signs were also seen on two wires sharing a <b>cable</b> <b>raceway</b> with FQIS wiring at station 955.|$|E
50|$|This {{compares to}} 339.3 s for kerosene/liquid oxygen (RD-180) and 452.3 s for hydrogen/oxygen (Block II SSME) {{bipropellant}} engines. Upper stage specific impulses are somewhat greater: {{as much as}} 303.8 s for APCP (Orbus 6E), 359 s for kerosene/oxygen (RD-0124) and 465.5 s for hydrogen/oxygen (RL10B-2). Propellant fractions are usually somewhat higher for (non-segmented) solid propellant first stages than for upper stages. The 117,000 lb Castor 120 first stage has a propellant mass fraction of 92.23% while the 31,000 lb Castor 30 upper stage developed for Orbital Science's Taurus II COTS (International Space Station resupply) launch vehicle has a 91.3% propellant fraction with 2.9% graphite epoxy motor casing, 2.4% nozzle, igniter and thrust vector actuator, and 3.4% non-motor hardware including such things as payload mount, interstage adapter, <b>cable</b> <b>raceway,</b> instrumentation, etc. Castor 120 and Castor 30 are 93 and 92 in in diameter, respectively, and serve as stages on the Athena IC and IIC commercial launch vehicles. A four-stage Athena II using Castor 120s as both first and second stages became the first commercially developed launch vehicle to launch a lunar probe (Lunar Prospector) in 1998.|$|E
40|$|All {{holders of}} {{operating}} licenses for nuclear power reactors, except {{those who have}} permanently ceased operations and have certified that fuel has been permanently removed from the reactor vessel, and fuel facilities licensees. PURPOSE The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing this information notice (IN) to inform addressees {{of the results of}} Hemyc electrical raceway fire barrier system (ERFBS) full-scale fire tests. The Hemyc ERFBS did not perform for one hour as designed because shrinkage of the Hemyc ERFBS occurred during the testing. It is expected that recipients will review the information for applicability to their facilities and consider actions as appropriate to avoid similar problems. However, suggestions contained in this information notice are not NRC requirements; therefore, no specific action or written response is required. BACKGROUND The Hemyc ERFBS, manufactured by Promatec, Inc., has been installed at nuclear power plants (NPPs) to protect circuits in accordance with regulatory requirements (Reference 1) and plant-specific commitments. As a result of fire protection inspections, unresolved items (URIs) were opened at some nuclear power stations due to questions raised regarding the fire resistance capability of the Hemyc ERFBS (Reference 2). The Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) performed a review of the Hemyc ERFBS (Reference 3) and requested the NRC’s Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) to perform confirmatory testing of this ERFBS. RES performed the testing at the Omega Point Laboratories in Elmendorf, Texas. DISCUSSION This information notice describes the results of the investigation of the fire resistance capability of the Hemyc ERFBS (Attachment 1). The NRC performed two ASTM E 119 furnace tests on a number of <b>cable</b> <b>raceway</b> types that are protected by the Hemyc ERFBS (with and without air gaps) in accordance with the Hemyc ERFBS test plan (see ADAMS Accession No. ML 043210141 for a preliminary version of the test plan). The test plan provides ML 050890089 IN 2005 - 0...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} {{system for the}} Phase 1 privatization facilities will support the TWRS mission by providing the electrical power to the Phase 1 privatized facilities. This system will receive power from the Department of Energy-Richland Operations (RL) A 4 - 8 230 kV transmission system powered from Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) Ashe and Midway 230 kV Substations. The existing RL 230 kV transmission line will be modified and looped 1021 into the new 230 kV substation bus. The new substation will {{be located in the}} vicinity of the privatized facilities, approximately 3. 2 km (2 mi) south of the existing RL A 4 - 8 230 kV transmission line. The substation will be capable of providing up to 40 MW of electrical power to support the Phase 1 privatization facilities and has space for accommodating future expansions. The substation will require at least two 230 - 13. 8 kV transformers, 13. 8 kV split bus switchgear, switchgear building, grounding transformers, instrument transformers, control and monitoring equipment, associated protection and isolation devices, lightning protection, yard lighting, <b>cable</b> and <b>raceways,</b> and infrastructure needed to provide desired availability and reliability. The power from the 13. 8 kV switchgear located in the switchgear building will be delivered at the privatization facilities site boundaries.

40|$|Scope of {{work for}} fiber-optic cable {{installations}} You asked for a determination of the appropriate work classification {{to be used for}} fiber-optic cable installation. The answer below is based on the information provided by you and Sound Transit. References to the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) and the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) are included. Again, this answer is based on your fact set. If the facts differ from those provided, the answers may be different. The fiber-optic cable was installed on the Sound Transit Seattle Link Light Rail Project on contract numbers C 803 and C 807. C 803 is a communications package with voice and data elements. C 807 is traction power including lineman activity, some D. C. high voltage and the fiber-optic connects to devices monitoring the system activity. Your information did not specify any work on C 802, a signalization system without voice transmission. The scope {{of work for}} Inside Wireman Electricians (WAC 296 - 127 - 01323) applies to some installation of fiber-optic cable: “The installation of conduit and interduct raceways for fiber optic cable and the pulling of fiber optic <b>cable</b> through these <b>raceways,</b> except telephone conduit and cable. ” Note the limited exception for “telephone conduit and cable. ” The Inside Wireman Electrician rates will apply to fiber-optic cable work that does not fit within the specifi...|$|R
