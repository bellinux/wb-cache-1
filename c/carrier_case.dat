40|$|Nonlinearity {{behavior}} in microwave circuits generates intermodulation products that {{can interfere with}} the desired output signals. Linearity requirement of a microwave circuit is often specified by third-order intersect point (IP 3) and 1 dB compression point (P 1 dB). These parameters are determined for an input {{of one or two}} signals whereas in reality microwave circuits often have a lot more than two input signals, and therefore it is desired to investigate the nonlinear behavior during a multi <b>carrier</b> <b>case.</b> In this thesis an investigation of the nonlinear {{behavior in}} an output amplifier when exposed to a multi <b>carrier</b> <b>case</b> has been performed. To perform the investigation a simplified simulation model was developed using the computer design software Advanced Design System. Measurements of a satellite converter output amplifier when subjected to multi carrier tests were conducted. This thesis also compares the simulation and measurement results for the multi <b>carrier</b> <b>case.</b> The figure of merit investigated, C/I, is determined as the relation between the carrier signals and the intermodulation products, and the relation between C/I, output power, IP 3 and P 1 dB was studied for the multi <b>carrier</b> <b>case.</b> The results showed that C/I is similar for the all investigated multi carrier cases if compared at the same total output power, and C/I is therefore not strongly affected by the number of input signals. The results also showed that C/I is limited by IP 3 at lower output powers, and by P 1 dB at higher output power. A breakpoint output power was found where C/I was affected by both IP 3 and P 1 dB. The relation between the breakpoint output power, Pout, IP 3 and P 1 dB for these measurements is given in the results. An important lesson from the thesis work is that the phases of the input signals are very significant for the output result of a multi <b>carrier</b> <b>case.</b> Thus when conducting a multi carrier simulation or test it is needed to use a suitable method to sum all contributions to the intermodulation product.

The results of these simulations indicate that the radio losses for turbo codes are low enough to warrant their use in deep space links (maximum of 1 dB loss at 17 dB loop signal to noise ratio for residual carrier and 1. 3 dB loss at 17 dB loop signal to noise ratio for suppressed carrier at high data rates). Furthermore, these results indicate that by normalizing the radio losses for frame size, loop bandwidth and the loop signal to noise ratio, a single curve could be used for calculating the radio loss for any given data rate at any given loop signal to noise ratio...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: As a group, {{women who}} carry {{germline}} mutations in partner and localizer {{of breast cancer}} 2 susceptibility protein (PALB 2) {{are at increased risk}} of breast cancer. Little is known about by how much or whether risk differs by mutation or family history, owing to the paucity of studies of cases unselected for family history. Methods: We screened 1, 403 case probands for PALB 2 mutations in a population-based study of Australian women with invasive breast cancer stratified by age at onset. The age-specific risk of breast cancer was estimated from the cancer histories of first- and second-degree relatives of mutation-carrying probands using a modified segregation analysis that included a polygenic modifier and was conditioned on the <b>carrier</b> <b>case</b> proband. Further screening for PALB 2 c. 3113 G > A (W 1038 X) was conducted for 779 families with multiple cases of breast cancer ascertained through family cancer clinics in Australia and New Zealand and 764 population-based controls. Results: We found five independent case probands in the population-based sample with the protein-truncating mutation PALB 2 c. 3113 G > A (W 1038 X); 2 of 695 were diagnosed before age 40 years and 3 of 708 were diagnosed when between ages 40 and 59 years. Both of the two early-onset <b>carrier</b> <b>case</b> probands had very strong family histories of breast cancer. Further testing found that the mutation segregated with breast cancer in these families. No c. 3113 G > A (W 1038 X) carriers were found in 764 population-based unaffected controls. The hazard ratio was estimated to be 30. 1 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 7. 5 to 120; P A mutation appears to be associated with substantial risks of breast cancer that are of clinical relevance. © 2010 Southey et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} a novel {{approach}} to increase the resource usage in digital communications. In digital communication systems, each information bearing data symbol is associated to a waveform which is transmitted over a physical medium. The time or frequency separations among the waveforms associated to the information data have always been chosen to avoid or limit the interference among them. By doing so, n {{the presence of a}} distortionless ideal channel, a single receive waveform is affected as little as possible by the presence of the other waveforms. The conditions necessary to meet the absence of any interference among the waveforms are well known and consist of a relationship between the minimum time separation among the waveforms and their bandwidth occupation or, equivalently, the minimum frequency separation and their time occupation. These conditions are referred to as Nyquist assumptions. The key idea of this work is to relax the Nyquist assumptions and to transmit with a time and/or frequency separation between the waveforms smaller than the minimum required to avoid interference. The reduction of the time and/or frequency separation generates not only an increment of the resource usage, but also a degradation in the quality of the received data. Therefore, to maintain a certain quality in the received signal, we have {{to increase the amount of}} transmitted power. We investigate the trade-off between the increment of the resource usage and the correspondent performance degradation in three different cases. The first case is the single <b>carrier</b> <b>case</b> in which all waveforms have the same spectrum, but have different temporal locations. The second one is the multi <b>carrier</b> <b>case</b> in which each waveform has its distinct spectrum and occupies all the available time. Finally, the hybrid case when each waveform has its unique time and frequency location. These different cases are framed within the general system modelling developed in the thesis so that they can be easily compared. We evaluate the potential of the key idea of the thesis by choosing a set of four possible waveforms with different characteristics. By doing so, we study the influence of the waveform characteristics in the three system configurations. We propose an interpretation of the results by modifying the well-known Shannon capacity formula and by explicitly expressing its dependency on the increment of resource usage and on the performance degradation. The results are very promising. We show that both in the case of a single carrier system with a time limited waveform and in the case of a multi-carrier system with a frequency limited waveform, the reduction of the time or frequency separation, respectively, has a positive effect on the channel capacity. The latter, depending on the actual SNR, can double or increase even more significantly. Nicht-konventionelle Multiträger-Luftschnittstelle für Mobilfunksystem...|$|E

This study aims to investigate the significance of KIF 1 B genetic variations in HBV-associated hepatitis in patients of Saudi Arabian ethnicity. TaqMan genotyping assay was used to investigate the association of three SNPs (rs 17401966, rs 12734551, and rs 3748578) in 584 normal healthy controls and 660 HBV-infected patients. The patients were categorized into inactive <b>carriers</b> (<b>Case</b> I), active <b>carriers</b> (<b>Case</b> II), Cirrhosis (Case III) and Cirrhosis-HCC (Case IV) sub-groups.

30|$|As {{the results}} for the single-component case are promising, let us now {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the proposed solution when the non-contiguous multicarrier transmission is applied for two adjacent component carriers. For each component carrier, the details of the transmit signal are analogous to the setup of the signal described in [13] for single-component <b>carrier</b> <b>case,</b> as we again assume the compatibility with LTE standard. In particular, SC-OFDM (UL) and OFDM (DL) occupying a maximum of 2 component carriers (CCs), 20 MHz bandwidth each, are considered. It is assumed that both CCs are generated and received using a single processing chain utilizing 4096 -point FFT/IFFT and spanning 61.44 MHz bandwidth (subcarrier spacing is equal to 15 kHz). This approach is advantageous over separate processing of each CC as it guarantees orthogonality between CCs. The frequency separation between both CCs is calculated to be 19.8 MHz according to [21], Section 5.7. 1 A. Both systems transmit their signals in dedicated time slots (0.5 ms duration each) composed of 7 OFDM/SC-OFDM symbols. While the first symbol in a slot utilizes 320 samples with CP, the rest are 288 samples long, each. It is assumed that there is no synchronization, neither in time, nor in frequency domain (as it is the most challenging scenario) between UL and flexible DL transmissions. The results were generated for 1000 OFDM/SC-FDMA frames shifted randomly in time. The frequency misalignment between both systems is 0.5 subcarrier spacing.|$|E

In this paper, we examine broadcast market, where carriers with different financial sources compete in the market, and analyze market performance {{as a result of}} competition. Especially, we focus on the effect of competition in the mixed market which includes advertising supported media and subscription fee supported media. We made economic model and analyze the difference on several types of market. Our principle results of Case III, the market that an advertisement supported carrier and a subscription supported carrier compete in the market, are as follows;. (1) The greater the substitutability is, the number of channels supplied by advertisement supported media increases while those supplied by subscription fee supported carrier decreases. (2) Total number of channels supplied by advertisement supported carrier and subscription fee supported carrier is equal to the number of channels supplied by an advertisement supported <b>carrier</b> (<b>Case</b> II).

40|$|A novel generic Technoeconomic, Environmental and Risk Analysis (TERA) {{computational}} method {{was developed for}} marine power plants that are composed of existing or at preliminary design stage marine gas turbines. The method is composed of several numerical models in order to realistically approach the life cycle operation of a marine gas turbine power plant-according to the operational profile of the platform marine vessel type-coupled to an integrated full electric propulsion system and stochastically estimate the power plant’s life cycle net present cost. The development of the TERA method {{led to the creation}} of an integrated computational marine vessel operation environment which was given the name “Poseidon”. The performance and exhaust emissions (nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and unburned hydrocarbon) of five 25 Megawatt marine gas turbines of the same technology level and design-point overhaul interval were simulated and modelled in “Poseidon”. The exhaust emissions of the modelled gas turbines were calibrated for two combustor technologies: conventional and dry-low emissions for both distillate fuel and natural gas used as fuel. The marine gas turbines are: existing simple cycle, novel twin-mode intercooled cycle, fictional intercooled cycle, fictional recuperated cycle and partly based on an existing design, intercooled/recuperated cycle. Three marine vessel types that require the same power plant output power and configuration but they utilise different operational profiles were also realistically modelled. The marine vessels are: Destroyer, RoPax fast ferry and LNG carrier. It was assumed that the Destroyer’s and RoPax fast ferry’s power plants use distillates fuel and the LNG carrier’s power plant uses compressed natural gas as fuel. Three case studies defined by each of the marine vessels were performed in order to investigate the economic feasibility of the advanced cycle gas turbine power plants in comparison with the power plant composed by existing gas turbines, in a possible future scenario were all four modelled exhaust emission quantities are accurately measured and taxed. The investment on dry-low emissions combustor technology was also investigated as part of each case study. Both technical and economic input datasets are realistic.
