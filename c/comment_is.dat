This <b>comment</b> <b>is</b> a joke about the construction of this episode; the blackboard and couch gags are taken from other episodes, there are clips from past episodes, and the interstitials are actually clips from past episodes that feature the family members talking in the kitchen.

25|$|The related {{concept of}} {{maternal}} mind-mindedness assesses the mother's {{ability to understand}} and verbalize the infant's mind: thoughts, desires, intentions and memories. Maternal mind-mindedness {{has been found to}} be related to some developmental results, such as attachment security. A caregiver's <b>comment</b> <b>is</b> deemed an appropriate mind-related comment if the comment was deemed to match the infant's behaviour by the independent coder, if the comment associated the infant's current activity to past activities, and/or if the comment encouraged the infant to go on with his or her intentions when the conversation paused. This correlates to high maternal mind-mindedness. If the caregiver assigns the wrong internal state to the baby's behaviour, if the comment about the current activity is not insufficiently associated with a past event, if the comment deters the infant from proceeding with the current activity, and/or if the <b>comment</b> <b>is</b> unclear, it is deemed a in-appropriate mind-related comment and correlates to low mind-mindedness.|$|E

25|$|Sherine first {{proposed}} {{the campaign in}} June 2008 in a guardian.co.uk <b>Comment</b> <b>is</b> Free blog post, Atheists – gimme five in the Guardian. She expressed her frustration that the Christian organisation JesusSaid.org was allowed to use bus advertising to promote the web address of a website that said that all non-Christians would burn in hell for all eternity. Sherine called on atheists to counter this kind of evangelical advertising by donating five pounds towards a positive philosophical advert. Her idea was taken up by political blogger Jon Worth, {{who went on to}} set up a PledgeBank page. The PledgeBank page closed on 31 July 2008, having received 877 of the 4,679 pledges necessary for the original target of £23,400. This event attracted some limited comment in the mainstream media early in August. Sherine then wrote a follow-up <b>Comment</b> <b>is</b> free article, Dawkin 'bout a Revolution, detailing events since the original piece. In response, the British Humanist Association offered to lend the campaign its official support and undertook to administer all donations. Sherine then asked Richard Dawkins for a quote for the campaign, at which point he offered to match the first £5,500 raised.|$|E

Ran’s <b>comment</b> <b>is</b> ambiguous (so that he might agree that they could take any three aliyyot), but Rivash assumes that Ran agreed with him that women could only take the seventh or, perhaps, the reading added on for the maftir. Further, when Hagahot Maimoniyot limits slaves to the seventh portion, the comment closes by citing his teacher, the more famous R. Meir of Rothenburg.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{bell was}} a 16ton (16.3-tonne) hour bell, cast on 6 August 1856 in Stockton-on-Tees by John Warner & Sons. The bell was possibly named {{in honour of}} Sir Benjamin Hall, and his name is inscribed on it. However, another theory for {{the origin of the}} name is that the bell may have been named after a contemporary heavyweight boxer Benjamin Caunt. It is thought that the bell was originally to be called Victoria or Royal Victoria in honour of Queen Victoria, but that an MP suggested the nickname during a Parliamentary debate; the <b>comment</b> <b>is</b> not recorded in Hansard.|$|E

In general, as discussed below, the Danubian Suebi, along with the neighbours such as the Vandals, apparently moved southwards into Roman territories, both south and east of the Danube, during this period.|$|E

During the picnic scene, for example, Mayhew asks Barton: [...] "Ain't writin' peace?" [...] Barton pauses, then says: [...] "No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain." [...] Such exchanges led critic William Rodney Allen to call Barton Fink [...] "an autobiography {{of the life of the}} Coens' minds, not of literal fact".

500|$|The {{change of}} {{direction}} to south-west provided much better travelling conditions, {{probably because the}} course to Franz Josef Land was broadly parallel to the lines of disturbance in the ice instead of perpendicular to them. Progress was swift: [...] "If this goes on," [...] Nansen recorded on 13 April, [...] "the return journey will be quicker than I thought." [...] However, the same diary entry records a mishap that day: both men's watches had stopped. Although Nansen's journal <b>comment</b> <b>is</b> mild, the incident was potentially disastrous. Without the correct time they could not calculate their longitude and thus maintain the correct course to Franz Josef Land. They restarted the watches based on Nansen's guesswork that their longitude was 86°E, but the pair were no longer certain where they were. If they were farther west than Nansen's assumption, they might miss Franz Josef Land altogether, {{and head for the}} open Atlantic.|$|E
500|$|Slashdot's editors are {{primarily}} responsible for selecting and editing the primary stories that are posted daily by submitters. The editors provide a one-paragraph summary for each story and a link to an external website where the story originated. Each story becomes the topic for a threaded discussion among the site's users. A user-based moderation system is employed to filter out abusive or offensive comments. Every <b>comment</b> <b>is</b> initially given a score of −1 to +2, with a default score of +1 for registered users, 0 for anonymous users (Anonymous Coward), +2 for users with high [...] "karma", or 1 for users with low [...] "karma". As moderators read comments attached to articles, they click to moderate the comment, either up (+1) or down (1). Moderators may choose to attach a particular descriptor to the comments as well, such as [...] "normal", [...] "offtopic", [...] "flamebait", [...] "troll", [...] "redundant", [...] "insightful", [...] "interesting", [...] "informative", [...] "funny", [...] "overrated", or [...] "underrated", with each corresponding to a −1 or +1 rating.
