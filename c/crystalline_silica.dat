5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free <b>crystalline</b> <b>silica</b> {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may all be present in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain <b>crystalline</b> <b>silica.</b>|$|E

40|$|Hydrated silica {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} martian {{deposits}} within aqueously altered mineral suites. Its common occurrence is attributed to its ease of formation in different weathering environments. Because of its presence in disparate units, hydrated silica makes a good tracer mineral to compare otherwise dissimilar martian deposits and relate their relative degrees of aqueous alteration. This work combines near-infrared and thermal-infrared spectroscopy to determine the relative degree of crystallinity and bulk SiO_ 2 abundance of surfaces containing hydrated silica. A range of crystalline structures are present, from non-crystalline (hydrated glass) to weakly crystalline (opal) to crystalline (quartz), implying a range in the maturity of these silica deposits. However, bulk SiO_ 2 contents show less diversity, with most martian hydrated silica deposits having SiO_ 2 abundances similar to Surface Type 2 (basaltic andesite or weathered basaltic composition) —a widespread and common surface composition that suggests limited interaction with water. We also find that hydrated silica crystallinity—as a proxy for degree of alteration—is correlated with the geochemistry of the deposit as inferred by its associated minerals: highly <b>crystalline</b> hydrated <b>silica</b> is found with Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates, moderately <b>crystalline</b> hydrated <b>silica</b> is associated with Al-phyllosilicates, and poorly crystalline phases are associated with sulfates.

40|$|Mid-infrared {{spectra of}} a few T Tauri stars (TTS) taken with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on board the Spitzer Space Telescope show {{prominent}} narrow emission features indicating <b>silica</b> (<b>crystalline</b> silicon dioxide). <b>Silica</b> {{is not a major}} constituent of the interstellar medium; therefore, any silica present in the circumstellar protoplanetary disks of TTS must be largely the result of processing of primitive dust material in the disks surrouding these stars. We model the silica emission features in our spectra using the opacities of various polymorphs of silica and their amorphous versions computed from earth-based laboratory measurements. This modeling indicates that the two polymorphs of silica, tridymite and cristobalite, which form at successively higher temperatures and low pressures, are the dominant forms of silica in the TTS of our sample. These high temperature, low pressure polymorphs of silica present in protoplanetary disks are consistent with a grain composed mostly of tridymite named Ada found in the cometary dust samples collected from the STARDUST mission to Comet 81 P/Wild 2. The silica in these protoplanetary disks may arise from incongruent melting of enstatite or from incongruent melting of amorphous pyroxene, the latter being analogous to the former.

40|$|Issue: All {{types of}} dust {{have come under}} {{increasing}} regulatory control in the U. S. {{because of the potential}} or perceived health hazards they pose toward workers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets standards for worker exposure to airborne dust under Federal regulations 29 CFR 1910. 1000. The standards can substantially effect the cost of dust control and material handling, as well as company liability for worker safety. Container glass is made from over 70 % silica.

40|$|The {{devitrification}} of {{amorphous silica}} to cristobalite {{and the subsequent}} beta-alpha transformation of cristobalite were studied as well the impact of both transformations on mechanical properties. The work was motivated {{by the need to}} transform 3 -D printed green molds composed of acryaltes and 60 vol% silica particles into refractory molds for the casting of single crystal Ni-superalloy. The 3 -D printed molds were produced by Large Area Maskless Photopolymerization (LAMP), a process that selectively cures layers of photo-suspension with patterned UV light to produce solid objects. Cristobalite content was required to achieve sufficient sintering and creep resistance in the in the sintered silica molds. However, cristobalite lowers room temperature strength due to cracking caused by the beta-alpha transition, requiring a compromise between creep resistance and strength. The development of crack-like flaws in LAMP molds prior to sintering was also addressed. The kinetics of the crystallization of amorphous silica to cristobalite was investigated and a time-temperature-transformation or TTT diagram was developed. The impact of seeding with cristobalite powder and use of <b>silica</b> with residual <b>crystalline</b> quartz were examined. The stress relaxation of partially <b>crystalline</b> sintered <b>silica</b> under fixed strain was studied as a function of cristobalite content.
