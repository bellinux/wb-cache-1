It could be seen from work done in Blumenau Regional prison, that a relation between drugs use and petty crimes was common among prison populations. The objective of this research was to understand the relationship between subjects responsible for petty crimes and the use of drugs. Ten male prisoners, aged between 20 and 32 were selected. All were recidivists and drug users, receiving sentences for theft, robbery, assault or drug traffic. Categories, based on Bardin’s methodology, were developed to analyze prisoners accounts. It could be seen from the accounts that, from their childhoods onwards, prisoners suffered situations of violence which began in their family environments. These violence situations expanded into the community and were repeated in <b>corrective</b> <b>institutions</b> for adolescents and later in prisons. The drug use became a palliative for the alleviation of negative feelings. It could be perceived that drug use and petty crimes were interrelated: a perfect partnership for law breaking...|$|R

25|$|While {{considering}} {{the issue of}} reliability of the primary data provided by <b>corrective</b> labor <b>institutions,</b> {{it is necessary to}} take into account the following two circumstances. On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.|$|R
40|$|Prison Officers (POs) {{involved}} in high need offender management frequently face risks {{that could affect}} their health, safety and wellbeing. Several {{studies have shown that}} direct client centred violence, inadequate management systems and the general nature of prison environments are major factors impacting on the well being of POs (Fisher 2 ̆ 6 Gunnison, 2001; Kiekbusch, Price, 2 ̆ 6 Theis, 2003; Mitchell, Mackenzie, Styve, 2 ̆ 6 Gover, 2000). There is limited literature on causes and effects of physical injuries on this group of law enforcements officers. This is the first study conducted in Western Australia (WA) that investigated the causes and effects of physical injuries to POs and the impacts thereof on these individuals and the Department of Corrective Services (DCS) as an organisation. The study aimed to provide a recent credible data source which may influence policy decisions and procedures in WA <b>corrective</b> <b>institutions.</b> The study cohort of 146 POs completed a questionnaire that included variables, such as health and fitness, job demands, support and constraints to ascertain the causes and effects of physical injuries among this high risk cohort of workers. The age range of POs included in the study cohort (N = 146) was 21 - 71 years. In addition, all Department of Correctional Services (DCS) physical injuries databases from 2008 to 2010 were analysed and managers and employee welfare services staff completed a questionnaire. The results indicated that there is a positive relationship between current employment status and work related physical injuries as measured over the last two years. The major causes of physical injuries were from slips trips and falls and hitting objects with part of the body or against objects during the process of managing non compliant prisoners. Variables such as physical fitness, job demands, lack of recognition by society, and fear of blood borne infections were significant predictors of physical injuries amongst POs. However, a number of other risk factors, including age and body mass index (BMI), were not related to the prevalence of physical injuries. There are a number of recommendations from the study that can be implemented. These include formation of accident/incident investigation work groups to conduct and analyse incidents and propose long term preventive and corrective measures. In order to improve ways of dealing with mentally ill prisoners and the training curriculum of POs should include management of mentally ill prisoners in a prison setting. In dealing with the aging population affecting the Australian workforce, DCS should develop plans to attract young POs for succession planning. Comprehensive safe physical training and maintenance programs in prisons may benefit the POs in dealing with prisoners. Areas for future research may include; the role of mental health services in reducing physical harm in prisons and minimising the causes and effects of physical injuries to the prison frontline workforce...|$|R
40|$|Background: An {{understanding}} of the decision of ending one’s life by people across the globe has to be interpreted within the respective culture. The microscopic processes of the suicidal minds and the cultural influences on them are still unclear. Limited number of qualitative studies have illuminated several areas for exploration; one area being that of ‘meanings’ attached to suicidal behaviors. Methods: This study addresses theoretic and methodological gaps by using a “cultural experience” model to guide a qualitative exploration of suicide attempts in Karachi, Pakistan. Pakistan is a rich multi-ethnic predominantly Muslim, South-Asian country that has low reported suicide rates and strong religious and legal sanctions against suicide. To examine the unique suicide situation in Pakistan, this study had two stages; first stage focused on individual meanings attributed to suicidal behavior by adult suicide attempters attending hospitals in Karachi (Pakistan). Qualitative in-depth interviews addressed the purpose, nature and meanings of the suicide, influence of meanings on decision-making and shaping of meanings within cultural context. The second stage focused on cultural meanings attributed by individuals from society (i. e., immediate family members, health care providers and members of <b>corrective</b> <b>institutions</b> that is medico-legal officers, police, lawyers). Data Analysis and Results: All interviews were transcribed verbatim. Grounded theory analysis was performed using NVIVO Version 11. The core category identified was an ‘Expectation-Reality Conflict’ that arose primarily in context of family and marital problems. Action-Interaction strategies adopted were that of ‘Upholding izzat/honor’, failure of which resulted in suicide threats, feelings of betrayal, anger, despair and hopelessness leading {{to a state of}} ‘ambivalence to life’. Suicide attempts occurred in a continued state of ambivalence. Religious prohibitions did not deter the suicidal process but attempters engaged in religious internal dialogue that involved rationalizations and distortions. Medico-legal investigation were negatively perceived as ‘interrogative’ and family made efforts to by-pass or avoid them in fear of shame. Interviewees in the second stage of the study believed that (1) suicidal acts are forbidden, shameful, selfish and done by a ‘weak personality’; (2) life stresses become unbearable because of mental illness for the suicidal individual; (3) suicidal attempts are ‘fake’ attempts with hidden agendas of gaining attention and sympathy or influencing family upon one’s decision, (4) marital problems especially domestic violence, impotency and divorce were special situations that ‘caused’ the suicide act; (5) health care providers, police and lawyers believed suicide prevention required family-based approaches. Medico-legal investigations were suggested as necessary for the deterrent effect although challenges of corruption and exploitation were recognized. Promotion of religious values was seen as the ‘ultimate’ suicide prevention strategy. Conclusion: An integrated model of the suicidal process involving culturally relevant variables is proposed based on the findings of this study. The context of family/marriage appears to be more prominent than religious and legal sanctions for the suicide attempters in Pakistan. Culturally-specific suicide prevention recommendations are suggested. published_or_final_versionSocial Work and Social AdministrationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|The article {{goes back}} to the basics. It {{questions}} the fairness of our current tort law regime and the philosophical underpinnings advanced in its defense, a theory with its roots in Aristotelian thought, called corrective justice. We critique tort law and corrective justice from a standpoint of egalitarian fairness, inspired by distributive justice philosophers such as John Rawls and Ronald Dworkin. Our argument is that the strict theoretical and institutional insulation of tort law—and the normative theory underlying it, <b>corrective</b> justice—from other <b>institutions</b> and principles of justice, namely distributive and retributive justice, gives rise to deleterious consequences in terms of global fairness. Specifically, we claim that luck plays an unjustifiable role in determining dissimilar liability for similarly negligent actors, and dissimilar compensation for equally blameless victims. As many egalitarians support negation of undeserved luck to assure equality, we think the active operation of luck in tort law is a compelling critique of current practice...|$|R

40|$|A educação profissional no Brasil esteve marcada, desde os seus primeiros registros, em administrar os efeitos da exclusão por meio da inserção, primeiramente, dos órfãos e desvalidos e, depois, dos menores infratores em instituições disciplinares e correcionais. Processo que forjou subjetividades em um registro da falta e do desvio com aprisionamento de corpos, bem como dos modos de produzir vida. No presente, os agora denominados adolescentes em conflito com a lei também estão inseridos em práticas específicas de educação para o trabalho, dentre as quais aquelas protagonizadas por organizações não governamentais. Esta pesquisa volta-se para essa prática educativa específica, pois objetiva {{investigar}} como os cursos de qualificação profissional básica de uma OSCIP habitam o campo de forças da Fundação CASA. Os subsídios teóricos e conceituais que compõem com essa problematização localizam-se nas contribuições de: Foucault, Spinoza, da esquizoanálise e da análise institucional. Subsídios estes que se articulam permitindo pensar o sujeito não como essência e sim como produção, a partir de relações de saber e poder por meio e entre instituições. Forjado pelo encontro com os diferentes campos em jogo (teórico-metodológico, de pesquisa e de forças), este estudo tem como hipótese que a complexidade da realidade, da subjetividade e dos encontros vida a fora produzem uma diversidade de modos de existir, educar e trabalhar não submetida exclusivamente a formas instituídas. Buscou-se, assim, compreender as relações institucionais em jogo e suas repercussões no referido trabalho educativo, a partir da implicação do pesquisador com o campo. Deste modo, foi empreendida uma pesquisa-intervenção com os educadores de qualificação profissional de uma OSCIP por meio da técnica do grupo focal. O encontro com os diferentes campos teceu relações de sentido, o que viabilizou entrever, entre as formas instituídas, modos de educar potentes em desestabilizar aprisionamentos subjetivos. Tal desestabilização, todavia, só ganha força em condições de produção peculiares. Dito de outra forma, esta pesquisa reconheceu que os cursos ora estudados são operados por modos de ser educador, que ganham ou perdem força de agir e compreender a partir das relações produzidas por meio e entre instituições. As conexões tecidas e desencadeadas pelo educador e pela OSCIP são forças que delineiam uma posição política de manutenção ou ruptura de modos de educar para o trabalho adolescentes em conflito com a lei. Nesse campo de forças, as práticas de educação profissional ganham intensidade quando aliadas a uma formação de educadores que os afete, mantendo o campo problemático e intensivo de derivas potentes em desestabilizar modos aprisionados de produzir vidaProfessional {{education in}} Brazil has been marked, from the beginning, by {{the intention of}} dealing with the effects of social exclusion by means of adopting social inclusion, firstly of the orphans and the underprivileged and, later on, of the juvenile lawbreakers from disciplinary and <b>corrective</b> <b>institutions.</b> This process has forged subjectivities into a register of failure and of deviance, with the imprisonment of the bodies and of the ways lives are constructed. At present, the so-called teenagers in conflict with the law are also involved with specific practices of education geared to work, amongst which are those enforced by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO). This research work focus on such educational practices, for it aims at investigating how the beginners professional qualifying courses held by a Public Interest Civil Society Organization (OSCIP, in the initials in Portuguese) inhabit the field of strengths of CASA Foundation. The theoretical and conceptual subsidies which support this problematization are based on the contributions by Foucault, Spinoza, as well as on schizoanalysis and institutional analysis. These subsidies articulate between them to allow thinking about the subject not as essence, but as production, {{from the perspective of the}} relations between knowledge and power by means of and between institutions. Undertaken in the coming together with the different fields at play (theoretical-methodological, of research and of strengths), this study offers as hypotheses that the complexity of reality, of subjectivity and of encounters throughout life, creates a diversity of ways of living, educating and working which are not submitted exclusively to institutionalized patterns. One has sought, therefore, to understand the institutional relations at play and their repercussion on the mentioned educational work, from the perspective of the researcher as she is implicated into the field. Thus, an intervention-research was carried out with the application of the focal group technique and which involved the professional qualifying course educators from an OSCIP. Coming in touch with the different fields allowed for the construction of meaning relations, what made possible to understand, amongst the institutionalized patterns, ways of educating with the potential of destabilizing subjective imprisonments. Such destabilizing, however, acquires strength only in unique conditions of production. In other words, it has been recognized that the courses surveyed in this study are operated by ways of being an educator, which acquire or lose strength for acting and comprehend on the basis of relations created by means of or between institutions. The connections woven and unleashed by the educators and by OSCIP are strengths which outline a political stand of either maintenance or rupture of the ways the teenagers in conflict with the law are educated for work. Within this field, the professional educational practices gain intensity when combined with a meaningful teacher formation, one which keeps the field problematic and adrift, powerful in destabilizing imprisoned ways of creating lif...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, victims’ {{rights have}} gained a central {{place in the}} {{academic}} and policy reflections both in North America and Europe. After decades of indifference, in which the victim was relegated to the marginal role of being a reporter of the crime and a witness in court, the light has been turned towards this figure, leading {{to the discovery of}} the importance of its contribution to the trial dialectical confrontation, a role traditionally reserved for the accused and the prosecutor. Starting from the 1970 s onwards, the «victims’ movement», composed of radical feminists, groups of ex-victims, lawyers, psychologists and psychiatrists, criminal justice agencies, academics, all moved by different ideologies and aims, struggled to put in the political and legislative agenda the victims’ need for consideration and respect. One of the most controversial issues on this subject, both from an international and domestic perspective, concerns the victim’s rights of participation in the criminal proceedings. In fact, the participation of the victim of a crime in the respective trial and, more specifically, the recognition of victim’s powers to intervene, in different ways, in the process, affects the utmost right of the accused to a fair trial. My research project aims at analyzing three different criminal models, looking at their evolution through the case-law of the different courts. Through a structural approach to the legal institutes, {{it will be possible to}} infer «le grands courants législatifs actuels» on the victim’s role and participation. The victims’ right to participate in court proceedings by expressing views and concerns through their own legal representative has been one of the major innovations of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Article 68 of the Rome Statute (the treaty that created the ICC) clearly declares that the Court shall permit the views and concerns of the victim to be presented and considered at stages of the proceedings determined to be appropriate by the Court. Since the first decision on the topic, issued by the Court in 2006, ICC judges have endorsed a broad interpretation of Article 68 and of the related articles of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence (Chapter II, Subsection 2), but failed to reach an agreement on the boundaries of that participation. Therefore, this essential right of the victim is influenced by the Pre-Trail and Trial Chambers different interpretations. A study of these decisions could bring to a wider knowledge of the topic, highlight potential improvements and explore failings in delivering meaningful participation to victims. The US system has been modified in 2004, with the approval of the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA) and the subsequent introduction of Section 3771 to title 18 of the US Code. The amendment has enumerated a list of rights afforded to the victims harmed as a result of «the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia», and between them «the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court, involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding». The emergent expanded role of the victim, under this most recent piece of legislation, has been drawn by the case-law, with particular progress in increased victim participation at sentencing. The study of the case-law could contribute to highlight differences and similarities with regard to the victim status in the European legislation. The most recent European directive (2012 / 29 /UE) on the subject was approved in October 2012. The first part of the directive defines the general status of the victims, recognizing them information from the first contact with a competent authority and about their case, their right to interpretation and translation and the right to understand and be understood; chapter 3, more specifically, states the right to be heard during criminal proceedings, to provide evidence and to receive a review of a decision not to prosecute. In 1989 the Italian code of criminal procedure has adopted the accusatorial system, keeping several <b>corrective</b> inquisitorial <b>institutions,</b> such as the participation in the trial of the parte civile (i. e. the damaged of the crime, not necessary coincident with the victim) to obtain punitive damages from the convicted. The parte civile can take part in the trial, but has no rights during the criminal investigations; meanwhile the victim as well, has very little chances to influence the investigation, helping the prosecutor to search evidences of the crime committed and of the supposed author. In the context of European law, modified by the Treaty of Lisbon, regulations and directive have an increasingly large impact on the national criminal systems. The analysis of the Italian decisions, implementing the directive, together with the study of US Courts case-law and ICC jurisprudence, could lead to a deeper comprehension of these three different criminal procedure systems, offering the basis to infer general trends and future perspective of the status of the victim participation in the criminal proceedings, at the international and national level...|$|R
