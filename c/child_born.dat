40|$|This study {{explored}} upper-limb {{and head}} kinematics during unimanual goal-directed movements in <b>children</b> <b>born</b> preterm (PT) and full-term (FT) aged 4 – 8 years. Further, functional lateralization was investigated through side-specific kinematics and hand preference observations. Altogether, 141 children were included, {{divided into three}} sub-groups based on gestation week at birth (GW). <b>Children</b> <b>born</b> FT (38 – 41 GW) and moderately PT (33 – 35 GW) showed faster, smoother, and shorter movement trajectories than <b>children</b> <b>born</b> very PT (V-PT< 33 GW). Only <b>children</b> <b>born</b> FT expressed evident side differences that were characterized by smoother movements with the preferred side. Regarding hand preference, the <b>children</b> <b>born</b> V-PT showed increased rates of non-right-handedness compared with the other groups. Regardless of hand preference, the <b>children</b> <b>born</b> V-PT showed less well organized movements compared with the other groups. These findings suggest that spatio-temporal movement organization and side specialization at pre-/early school-age are affected by a PT birth, and more frequently so for <b>children</b> <b>born</b> before 33 GWs, indicating long-lasting influences on neuromotor development and specialization.

40|$|Background: The {{majority}} of <b>children</b> <b>born</b> preterm are considered neurologically normal {{and free of}} disability. However, follow-up studies at school age report that preterm <b>children</b> <b>born</b> without major impairment have more subtle impairments, including language difficulties, which influence their ability to function. These findings indicate a need to examine specific language-processing skills in <b>children</b> <b>born</b> preterm across the school years. Aims: To compare oral narrative skills of <b>children</b> <b>born</b> preterm with their peers born at full term. Methods 2 ̆ 6 Procedures: The research used an independent groups design to examine the narrative ability of 30 children aged between 9 years; 8 months and 10 years; 11 months: 15 <b>children</b> <b>born</b> before 33 weeks’ gestation (preterm group) and 15 children matched for chronological age born at full gestation (greater than 38 weeks). Seven measures assessed productivity, structure, complexity, and formulation abilities. The research used univariate analysis to examine variations in outcomes based on group status (preterm versus full term). Outcomes 2 ̆ 6 Results: The results showed group effects on the formulation measures but not the productivity, complexity or quality measures. <b>Children</b> <b>born</b> preterm produced more utterances with mazes and had more disruptions than <b>children</b> <b>born</b> at full term.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{existence}} of the "magic moment" for parental marriage immediately post-birth and to inform policies that preferentially encourage biological over step parent marriage, this study estimates the incidence and stability of maternal marriage for <b>children</b> <b>born</b> out of wedlock.

40|$|In recent years, both in Russia {{and most}} {{economically}} developed countries {{there is a}} growth of illegitimate births. The {{birth of a child}} prior to marriage is usually considered as a risk factor for his health. In Murmansk maternity hospitals, there was an assessment of main health indices of 3 newborns groups: born in registered marriage (114 children), in civil marriage (106 <b>children)</b> and <b>born</b> to unwed mothers (103 children). By questioning mothers, the authors have revealed certain medical and social risk factors for their health. It was established that the health of <b>children</b> <b>born</b> in civil marriage is not worse and according to some indices it is even better than the health of <b>children</b> <b>born</b> in registered marriage. According to most parameters, the health of <b>children</b> <b>born</b> to unwed mothers was certainly worse than the health of the newly <b>born</b> <b>children</b> <b>born</b> to mothers in registered marriage. The differences in indices were due to a larger number of medical and social risk factors, negatively affecting the health of the <b>children</b> <b>born</b> to unwed mothers. Misbegotten children cannot be considered as one group of a social risk. We should only refer <b>children</b> <b>born</b> to unwed mothers to the high risk group, while according to the level of health risk <b>children</b> <b>born</b> in civil marriage are comparable with <b>children</b> <b>born</b> to mothers in registered marriage.

40|$|Background: To {{assess whether}} {{maternal}} cosmetic breast implants {{are associated with}} adverse health outcomes among offspring, the authors examined published findings of epidemiologic studies that addressed this hypothesis. Methods: Four epidemiologic studies, ail from Scandinavia, were identified. Women with breast implants were identified from existing public and private registers of patients, and their offspring were traced through nationwide population and birth registers. The. studies included a total of 11, 445 women with breast implants and 3248 <b>children</b> <b>born</b> after the mothers' implantation procedures. Comparison was made with <b>children</b> <b>born</b> to mothers who had undergone other cosmetic surgery or general population controls. Outcomes under study were congenital malformations, hospitalization for esophageal and rheumatic disorders, and perinatal mortality. Results: Overall, the studied outcomes were similar between <b>children</b> <b>born</b> to mothers with breast implants and children of controls, and between <b>children</b> <b>born</b> before and after maternal breast implantation. In the Danish studies, significantly elevated rates of esophageal disorders were observed for <b>children</b> <b>born</b> before (observed-to-expected ratio, 2. 0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1. 3 to 2. 8) but not after (observed-to-expected ratio, 1. 3; 95 percent confidence interval, 0. 5 to 2. 9) the mother's breast implant surgery. Similar excesses were observed among control <b>children</b> <b>born</b> before and after maternal breast reduction.
