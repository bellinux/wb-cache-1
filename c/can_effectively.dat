5|$|Binary search trees lend {{themselves}} to fast searching in external memory stored in hard disks, as binary search trees <b>can</b> <b>effectively</b> be structured in filesystems. The B-tree generalizes this method of tree organization; B-trees are frequently used to organize long-term storage such as databases and filesystems.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and baking soda <b>can</b> <b>effectively</b> clean affected surfaces.|$|E
5|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of wasps play no role in pollination, a few species <b>can</b> <b>effectively</b> transport pollen and pollinate several plant species. Since wasps generally do not have a fur-like covering of soft hairs and a special body part for pollen storage (Pollen basket) as some bees do, pollen does not stick to them well. However {{it has been shown that}} even without hairs, several wasp species are able to effectively transport pollen, therefore contributing for potential pollination of several plant species.|$|E

5|$|Changes in {{direction}} {{of this nature}} are most commonly observed {{as a result of}} a cyclone's interaction with other low pressure systems, troughs, ridges, or with anticyclones. A strong and stationary anticyclone <b>can</b> <b>effectively</b> block the path of an extratropical cyclone. Such blocking patterns are quite normal, and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone, the weakening of the anticyclone, a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone's periphery, or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions. It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes can {{be either}} {{activated}} or inhibited by other molecules. For example, the end product(s) of a metabolic pathway are often inhibitors {{for one of the}} first enzymes of the pathway (usually the first irreversible step, called committed step), thus regulating the amount of end product made by the pathways. Such a regulatory mechanism is called a negative feedback mechanism, because the amount of the end product produced is regulated by its own concentration. Negative feedback mechanism <b>can</b> <b>effectively</b> adjust the rate of synthesis of intermediate metabolites according {{to the demands of the}} cells. This helps with effective allocations of materials and energy economy, and it prevents the excess manufacture of end products. Like other homeostatic devices, the control of enzymatic action helps to maintain a stable internal environment in living organisms.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds have {{a simple}} stomach that is similar in {{structure}} to terrestrial carnivores. Most species have neither a cecum nor a clear demarcation between the small and large intestines; the large intestine is comparatively short and only slightly wider than the latter. Small intestine lengths range from 8 (California sea lion) to 25 times (elephant seal) the body length. The length of the intestine may be an adaptation to frequent deep diving, as the increased volume of the digestive tract serves as an extended storage compartment for partially digested food during submersion. Pinnipeds {{do not have an}} appendix. As in most marine mammals, the kidneys are divided into small lobes and <b>can</b> <b>effectively</b> absorb water and filter out excess salt.|$|E
