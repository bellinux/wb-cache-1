30|$|From Table 1, it {{is clear}} that SGO {{provides}} better optimal results in as many as 12 functions <b>compared</b> to GA, 5 functions <b>compared</b> to PSO, 4 functions <b>compared</b> to DE, 3 functions <b>compared</b> to ABC and 2 functions <b>compared</b> to TLBO. It can be arrived at a conclusion here that SGO is very competitive <b>compared</b> to ABC and especially with TLBO. However, we have noted that SGO is faster when <b>compared</b> to other algorithms. It takes 1 / 500 th function evaluations <b>compared</b> to GA, PSO, DE and ABC for all functions except for Rosenbrock wherein it takes 1 / 50 th of total function evaluations. And it is computing almost in half of the total function evaluations <b>compared</b> to TLBO except for Rosenbrock for which SGO takes 1 / 5 th number of function evaluation as against TLBO. From the above findings, we may arrive at a conclusion that our proposed algorithm not only performs better <b>compared</b> to many state-of-the art algorithms like GA, PSO, DE but also very competitive with ABC and TLBO in providing optimal solutions. Importantly, SGO takes less computation efforts <b>compared</b> to all other algorithms investigated in this section.|$|R
