40|$|Objective. The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} 1) to develop standard testing practices to be used when evaluating <b>crush</b> <b>resistance</b> properties of abuse deterrent formulations, and 2) to determine which methods of particle size reduction (manual or electrical) are the most discriminatory for measuring <b>crush</b> <b>resistance</b> of tablet dosage forms. Background. Crushing, or particle size reduction, is often the first step to make a medication easier to snort, to dissolve for injection, or to destroy slowrelease mechanisms in order to achieve greater euphoric effects. However, no standard methods exist on testing crush resistant properties of prescription medications susceptible to abuse. Such testing is crucial for comparative purposes and to obtain abuse-deterrent labelling for the newly-marketed abuse-deterrent products. Methods. Tablets containing poly(ethylene oxide) as a deterrent agent and acetaminophen as model drug were formulated on tablet press (2000 pounds) before undergoing a post compaction thermal process reported for a crush-resistant marketed formulation. <b>Crush</b> <b>resistance</b> was then assessed using manual (i. e., pill crusher, pestle-mortar) and mechanical (i. e., hardness tester, ball mill, high shear grinder, domestic blender) methods at different time durations and sample mass. The resultant product was then analyzed by sieve analysis. Results. Significant differences were observed between the particle size distributions using different methods. The domestic blender and high shear grinder had better ability to differentiate products compared to other tooling. Conclusion. There is no universal method to measure <b>crush</b> <b>resistance,</b> and methods used to perform particle size reduction can display different level of resistance to manipulation Grants.

40|$|Most of {{the shell}} {{material}} in snails is composed of calcium carbonate but the organic shell matrix determines the properties of calcium carbonate crystals. It {{has been shown that}} the deposition of calcium carbonate is affected by the ingestion of organic compounds. We hypothesize that organic compounds not synthesized by the snails are important for shell strength and must be obtained from the diet. We tested this idea indirectly by evaluating whether the abundance of the organic matter that snails eat is related to the strength of their shells. We measured shell <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> in the snail Mexipyrgus churinceanus and the abundance of the most common aquatic macrophyte, the water lily Nymphaea ampla, in ten bodies of water in the valley of Cuatro Ciénegas, Mexico. We used stable isotopes to test the assumption that these snails feed on water lily organic matter. We also measured other factors that can affect <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance,</b> such as the density of crushing predators, snail density, water pH, and the concentration of calcium and phosphorus in the water. The isotope analysis suggested that snails assimilate water lily organic matter that is metabolized by sediment bacteria. The variable that best explained the variation in <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance</b> found among sites was the local abundance of water lilies. We propose that the local amount of water lily organic matter provides organic compounds important in shell biomineralization, thus determining <b>crushing</b> <b>resistance.</b> Hence, we propose that a third trophic level could be important in the coevolution of snai...|$|E
