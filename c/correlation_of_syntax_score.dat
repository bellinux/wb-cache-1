40|$|Background We {{need new}} {{biomarkers}} that can predict cardiovascular disease to improve both diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. The CIRCULATING CELLS {{study was designed}} to study the role of several cellular mediators of atherosclerosis as biomarkers of coronary artery disease (CAD). An objective and reproducible method for the quantification of CAD extension is required to establish relationships with these potential biomarkers. We sought to analyse the <b>correlation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> with known CAD risk factors to test it as a valid marker of CAD extension. Methods and results A subgroup of 279 patients (67. 4 % males) were included in our analysis. Main exclusion criteria were a history of previous percutaneous coronary intervention or surgical revascularisation that prevent an accurate assessment of the SS. Diabetes mellitus, smoking, renal insufficiency, body mass index and a history of CAD and myocardial infarction were all positively and strongly associated with a higher <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> after adjustment for the non-modifiable biological factors (age and sex). In the multivariate model, age and male sex, along with smok- ing and renal insufficiency, remain statistical significantly associated with the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> Conclusion In a selected cohort of revascularisation-naive patients with CAD undergoing coronary angiography, non-modifiable cardiovascular risk factors such as advanced age, male sex, as well as smoking and renal failure were independently associated with CAD complexity assessed by the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> may be a valid marker of CAD extension to establish relationships with potential novel biomarkers of coronary atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is a global}} problem with {{increasing}} incidence in Asia. Prior studies reported inter-ethnic differences in the prevalence of CAD rather than the severity of CAD. The angiographic "synergy between percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with taxus and cardiac surgery" (<b>SYNTAX)</b> <b>score</b> quantifies CAD severity and predicts outcomes. We studied CAD severity and all-cause mortality in four globally populous ethnic groups: Caucasians, Chinese, Indians and Malays. METHODS: We quantified <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> 1, 000 multi-ethnic patients undergoing PCI in two tertiary hospitals in the Netherlands (Caucasians) and Singapore (Chinese, Indians and Malays). Within each ethnicity we studied 150 patients with stable CAD and 100 with ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI). We made inter-ethnic comparisons <b>of</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Despite having a younger age (mean age Indians: 56. 8 and Malays: 57. 7 vs. Caucasians: 63. 7 years), multivariable adjusted <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> were significantly higher in Indians and Malays than Caucasians with stable CAD: 13. 4 [11. 9 - 14. 9] and 13. 4 [12. 0 - 14. 8] vs. 9. 4 [8. 1 - 10. 8], p< 0. 001. Among STEMI patients, <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> were highest in Chinese and Malays: 17. 7 [15. 9 - 19. 5] and 18. 8 [17. 1 - 20. 6] vs. 15. 5 [13. 5 - 17. 4] and 12. 7 [10. 9 - 14. 6] in Indians and Caucasians, p< 0. 001. Over a median follow-up of 709 days, 67 deaths (stable CAD: 37, STEMI: 30) occurred. Among STEMI patients, the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> independently predicted all-cause mortality: HR 2. 5 [1. 7 - 3. 8], p< 0. 001 for every 10 -point increase. All-cause mortality was higher in Indian and Malay STEMI patients than Caucasians, independent <b>of</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (adjusted HR 7. 2 [1. 5 - 34. 7], p= 0. 01 and 5. 8 [1. 2 - 27. 2], p= 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Among stable CAD and STEMI patients requiring PCI, CAD is more severe in Indians and Malays than in Caucasians, despite having a younger age. Moreover, Indian and Malay STEMI patients had a greater adjusted risk of all-cause mortality than Caucasians, independent <b>of</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score...</b>|$|R
40|$|BackgroundPercutaneous {{coronary}} intervention (PCI) is {{well established}} procedure for management of coronary artery disease. However, up to 50 % of cases associated with myocardial injury with subsequent increased mortality. Currently there is no reliable method to predict this injury. Aim of the workto investigate the ability <b>of</b> the <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> to predict peri-procedure myocardial injury (PMI) in patients undergoing PCI. Patients and Methods: This study included 60 patients. They are {{divided into two groups}} (1 =Non-diabetics) and (2 =Diabetics) and subjected to: History and physical examination, ECG, echocardiography, calculation <b>of</b> <b>syntax</b> <b>score,</b> PCI and troponin T. ResultsOur study shows highly significant elevation in the troponin level in both groups after PCI, this elevation was more in group (2) (< 0. 001). In all study population the incidence of PMI was low in patients with low <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> and increased proportionally with the increase in <b>syntax</b> <b>score.</b> We found the <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> cutoff value for prediction of PMI to be 15 with calculated sensitivity of 95. 3 %, specificity 88. 2 %, predictive value positive 95. 3 % and Predictive value negative 88. 2 %. ConclusionSyntax score has the ability to predict the occurrence of PMI with accepted sensitivity. It can assess the patient risk for development of PMI which could help to rationalize the use of adjunctive therapies as distal embolic protection devices in high risk patients. Also, diabetic patients have higher incidence of complicated coronary lesions, higher <b>syntax</b> <b>score</b> and they are more labile for PMI...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: When {{performing}} {{coronary angiography}} {{in patients with}} acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the anatomical extent of coronary disease usually prevails in the prognostic reasoning. It {{has not yet been}} proven if clinical data should be accounted for in risk stratification together with anatomical data. Objective: To test the hypothesis that clinical data increment the prognostic value of anatomical data in patients with ACS. Methods: Patients admitted with objective criteria for ACS and who underwent angiography during hospitalization were included. Primary outcome was defined as in-hospital cardiovascular death, and the prognostic value <b>of</b> the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> (anatomical data) was compared to that of the SYNTAX-GRACE Score, which resulted from the incorporation of the GRACE <b>Score</b> into the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> The Integrated Discrimination Improvement (IDI) was calculated to evaluate the SYNTAX-GRACE Score ability to correctly reclassify information from the traditional SYNTAX model. Results: This study assessed 365 patients (mean age, 64 ± 14 years; 58 % male). In-hospital cardiovascular mortality was 4. 4 %, and the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was a predictor of that outcome with a C-statistic of 0. 81 (95 % CI: 0. 70 - 0. 92; p < 0. 001). The GRACE Score was a predictor of in-hospital cardiac death independently <b>of</b> the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> (p < 0. 001, logistic regression). After incorporation into the predictive model, the GRACE Score increased the discrimination capacity <b>of</b> the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> from 0. 81 to 0. 92 (95 % CI: 0. 87 - 0. 96; p = 0. 04).

BackgroundThe validity <b>of</b> the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> has been adequately evaluated. MethodsThe <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> were calculated for 1, 580 patients in a large multicenter registry who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (n = 819) or {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) (n = 761) for ULMCA stenosis. The outcomes of interests were 3 -year incidences of major adverse vascular events (MAVE), including death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, and stroke and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), including MAVE and target vessel revascularization of ULMCA. ResultsThe incidence of 3 -year MAVE was 6. 2 % in the lowest (≤ 23), 7. 1 % in the intermediate (23 to ∼ 36), and 17. 4 % in the highest (> 36) <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> tertile groups after PCI (p = 0. 010). However, the incidences of MAVE in the CABG group and MACCE in the PCI and CABG groups did not differ among the SYNTAX tertiles. In subgroups, the MAVE (p = 0. 005) and MACCE (p = 0. 007) rates according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> tertiles were significantly different in patients receiving drug-eluting stent, not in those receiving bare-metal stent.

40|$|Aim. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether the automated carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) identified by using automated software could predict the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> for coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. Methods. Three-hundred-seventy consecutive patients (males 218; median age 69 11 years) who underwent carotid-ultrasound and coronary angiography were analyzed. Two experienced interventional cardiologists calculated the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> from the carotid angiograms. After ultrasonographic examinations were performed, the plaque score (PS) was calculated and automated carotid IMT analysis was obtained by a fully automated algorithm. Correlation and stepwise logistic regression analysis were calculated and also the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was computed. Results. The mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was 8. 1 +/- 14. 4; the PS was 7. 1 +/- 14. 4 and the mean CIMT was 0. 86 +/- 0. 23 mm (Normality rejected with a P-value of 0. 001). A statistically significant correlation was found between the CIMT and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (r= 0. 323; P= 0. 0001) and between the PS and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (r= 0. 583; P= 0. 0001).

MethodsAll patients with de novo left main or 3 -vessel disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting from January 2005 to December 2008 at our institution (Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain) were retrospectively assessed, and their <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was calculated. The influence <b>of</b> the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> on postprocedural and follow-up mortality and combined major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (including death, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, and repeat revascularization) was identified by multivariate analysis.

Mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was 34. 5 (standard deviation, 6. 7; range,  11. 5 – 76). Three groups of patients were identified according to the score terciles: low (≤ 33), intermediate (33 – 37), and high (> 37). These terciles scores differed greatly from those reported by the SYNTAX trial investigators. The multivariate analysis identified that the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>Score</b> was associated with follow-up mortality (hazard ratio =  1. 046, P = . 015) and combined early and follow-up major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (odds ratio =  1. 079, P < . 001; and hazard ratio =  1. 034, P = . 026, respectively).

The CSS was calculated using age, and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction and creatinine clearance. A stratified post hoc comparison was performed for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR), definite stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 1 - and 5 -year follow-up. Tertiles for <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and CSS were defined as SSLOW ≤ 7, 7 14 and CSSLOW ≤ 8. 0, 8. 0 17. 0, respectively. Major adverse cardiac events rates were significantly higher in SSHIGH compared with SSLOW at 1 - and 5 -year follow-up, which was also seen at 5 years for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, MI, and TLR. Stratifying outcomes across CSS tertiles confirmed and augmented these results. Within CSSHIGH, 5 -year MACE increased with use of paclitaxel- compared with sirolimus-eluting stents (34. 7 vs. 21. 3 %, P= 0. 008). <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and CSS were independent predictors of 5 -year MACE; CSS was an independent predictor for 5 -year mortality.

We compared clinical outcomes of PCI versus CABG in patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 34 and patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> > 34. ResultsThe rates of 2 -year mortality were similar between CABG and PCI in the group <b>of</b> patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 34 (6. 2 % vs. 8. 1 %, p = 0. 461). Among patients with <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> > 34, those treated with CABG had lower rates of mortality (8. 5 % vs. 32. 7 %, p 34 (hazard ratio: 2. 54, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 09 to 5. 92, p = 0. 031).

40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundRefinements in {{percutaneous}} coronary intervention (PCI), {{including the}} use of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and fractional flow reserve (FFR), have allowed the treatment of complex lesions with good results. As a result, the percutaneous approach for left main coronary artery (LM) lesions has spread, including centers with a lower volume of PCI procedures. Our objective was to report the early and late outcomes of PCI in unprotected LM lesions. MethodsConsecutive patients treated at two different hospitals from August 2009 to July 2013 were included. The indication for the percutaneous approach was based on the clinical assessment and the calculation <b>of</b> <b>Syntax</b> <b>score,</b> EuroScore and on the patient’s wishes. ResultsTwenty-eight patients with mean age of 69. 2 ± 10. 1 years were treated, 39 % were diabetic and 39 % had acute coronary syndromes. Half of the patients had EuroScore≥ 6; the <b>Syntax</b> <b>score</b> was 26. 0 ± 8. 4 and 82 % had LM bifurcation lesions. Interventions were guided by IVUS and/or FFR in 71. 4 % of the patients, 93 % were treated with drug-eluting stents, and the 1 -stent technique was used in most occasions. Angiographic success was achieved in 100 % of the cases. At the 19. 2 ± 13. 7 month follow-up, the rate of major adverse cardiac events was 21. 4 % in the follow-up longer than 4 years, cardiac death 14. 2 %, non-fatal myocardial infarction 3. 5 % and target-lesion revascularization 3. 5 %.

We evaluated its role in predicting clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in non-selected patients, treated in the daily clinical practice of a reference center. METHODSAnalysis of patients undergoing PCI from March to September 2009 and followed-up for up to 12 months. Patients were divided in tertiles according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> The primary endpoint included major adverse cardiac events (MACE) – death, non-fatal acute myocardial infarction and target-vessel revascularization. The ability <b>of</b> the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> in predicting MACE was assessed by the ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) curve. RESULTSTwo hundred and thirty-four patients with a mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> <b>of</b> 11. 6 ± 6. 2 points were included. Tertile I had a <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> ≤ 9 (average 5. 9); tertile II, > 9 and≤ 13 (average 10. 8); and tertile III, > 13 (average 18. 3). In the clinical follow-up of 7. 2 ± 4. 9 months, the incidence of MACE was greater in tertile III when compared to tertiles I and II (2. 5 % vs. 6. 4 % vs. 14. 1 %; P= 0. 0075). The ROC curve showed an area under the curve of 0. 667 (P= 0. 012) indicating a moderate ability to anticipate the occurrence of MACE in this population.

40|$|Background/Aim. The FINish Diabetes RIsk SCore (FINDRISC) which {{includes}} age, {{body mass index}} (BMI), waist circumference, physical (in) activity, diet, arterial hypertension, history of high glucose levels, and family history of diabetes, {{is of a great}} significance in identifying patients with impaired glucose tolerance and a 10 -year risk assessment of developing type 2 diabetes in adults. Due {{to the fact that the}} FINDRISC score includes parameters which are risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD), our aim was to determine a correlation between this score, and some of its parameters respectively, with the severity of angiographically verified CAD in patients with stable angina in two ways: according to the Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (<b>SYNTAX)</b> <b>score</b> and the number of diseased coronary arteries. Methods. The study included 70 patients with stable angina consecutively admitted to the Clinic of Cardiology, Military Medical Academy, Belgrade. The FINDRISC score was calculated in all the patients immediately prior to angiography. Venous blood samples were collected and inflammatory markers [erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leucocytes, C-reactive protein (CRP), total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and fasting glucose] determined. Coronary angiography was performed in order to determine the severity of coronary artery disease according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> and the number of affected coronary vessels: 1 -vessel, 2 -vessel or 3 -vessel disease (hemodynamically significant stenoses: more than 70 % of the blood vessel lumen). The patients were divided into three groups regarding the FINDRISC score: group I: 5 - 11 points; group II: 12 - 16 points; group III: 17 - 22 points. Results. Out of 70 patients (52 men and 18 women) enrolled in this study, 14 had normal coronary angiogram. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between the FINDRISC score and its parameters respectively (age, body mass index-BMI, waist circumference) and the severity of CAD according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> (p < 0. 001) and the number of diseased coronary arteries (p < 0. 001). The patients with higher FINDRISC score (groups II and III) had more severe and extensive CAD according to the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> than the group I. The odds ratio with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) between the group III and the group I was 5. 143 (95 % CI 1. 299 - 20. 360, p = 0. 002) and between the group II and the group I 5. 867 (95 % CI 1. 590 - 21. 525, p = 0. 007). There were no differences in odds ratio for multivessel disease according to FINDRISC score between the group II and the group III [1. 141; (95 % CI 0. 348 - 3. 734). In the group I mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was 5. 18, and more than 70 % of patients had normal coronary angiogram. In the group II mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was 17. 06, and more than 70 % of patients had 2 -vessel disease and 3 - vessel disease, and in the group III mean <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was 18. 89, and 2 -vessel and 3 -vessel disease had 36. 36 % and 31. 82 % patients, respectively. In multiple regression analysis, where <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was dependent variable, and age, BMI, waist circumference, FINDRISC score were independent variables, we found that only FINDRISC score was independent predictor <b>of</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score.</b> Conclusion.

BackgroundThere is a controversial debate regarding when and how to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for an uLMCA stenosis. MethodsThis analysis is based on a randomized study of 607 patients undergoing PCI for uLMCA, randomized 1 : 1 to receive paclitaxel- or sirolimus-eluting stents. We evaluated the impact <b>of</b> the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score,</b> uLMCA anatomy, and stenting technique on in-stent restenosis (ISR), target lesion revascularization (TLR), and the 3 -year outcomes. ResultsThe 3 -year cardiac mortality rate was 5. 8 %; 235 (39 %) patients had a true bifurcation lesion (TBL), and the median <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> was 27. TBL was associated with a higher need for multiple stents (72 % vs. 37 %, p < 0. 001). TBL {{was a significant predictor of}} ISR (23 % vs. 14 %, p = 0. 008) and for TLR (18 % vs. 9 %, p < 0. 001). The need for multiple stents was a predictor of ISR (22 % vs. 13 %, p = 0. 005) and for TLR (16 % vs. 9 %, p = 0. 005). Culotte stenting showed better results compared with T-stenting for ISR (21 % vs. 56 %, p = 0. 02) and for TLR (15 % vs. 56 %, p < 0. 001). We observed a significant association between uLMCA-TLR and <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>scores</b> (9. 2 % for scores ≤ 22, 14. 9 % for scores 23 to 32, and 13. 0 % for scores ≥ 33, p = 0. 008).

SYNTAX found the two strategies to be similar for hard endpoints (death and MI). Those receiving PCI required more repeat revascularisation (hence the primary endpoint analysis did not find PCI to be non-inferior), but those undergoing CABG had significantly more strokes pre or perioperatively. Use <b>of</b> the <b>SYNTAX</b> risk <b>score</b> is being investigated {{as a method of}} identifying those multivessel disease patients in whom PCI is a reasonable option vs those in whom CABG remains the preferred strategy.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES This study {{aimed to}} update the Logistic Clinical <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> to predict 3 -year {{survival}} after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and compare the performance with the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> alone. BACKGROUND The <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> is a well-established angiographic tool to predict long-term outcomes after PCI. The Logistic Clinical <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score,</b> developed by combining clinical variables with the anatomic <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score,</b> {{has been shown to}} perform better than the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> alone in predicting 1 -year outcomes after PCI. However, the ability of this score to predict long-term survival is unknown. METHODS Patient-level data (N = 6, 304, 399 deaths within 3 years) from 7 contemporary PCI trials were analyzed. We revised the overall risk and the predictor effects in the core model (<b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score,</b> age, creatinine clearance, and left ventricular ejection fraction) using Cox regression analysis to predict mortality at 3 years. We also updated the extended model by combining the core model with additional independent predictors of 3 -year mortality (i. e., diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and body mass index). RESULTS The revised Logistic Clinical SYNTAX models showed better discriminative ability than the anatomic <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> for the prediction of 3 -year mortality after PCI (c-index: <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score,</b> 0. 61; core model, 0. 71; and extended model, 0. 73 in a cross-validation procedure). The extended model in particular performed better in differentiating low- and intermediate-risk groups. CONCLUSIONS Risk scores combining clinical characteristics with the anatomic <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> substantially better predict 3 -year mortality than the <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>score</b> alone and should be used for long-term risk stratification of patients undergoing PCI...|$|R
