When Schrader died in the AIDS epidemic in 1993, Bohnett, like many surviving same-sex partners prior to marriage equality, was left with no legal spousal benefits and a significant estate tax bill. He did however receive $386,000 from Schrader's life insurance. Bohnett had been a staff information systems consultant at Arthur Andersen from 1980 to 1983 and, unable to be openly gay in that world, he had left to work at software companies instead. As his career in software was progressing, and shortly after Schrader’s death, he searched {{for a way to}} tie together the software and activist sides of his life.

A major retrospective, assembling 130 objects of Cattelan's career since 1989, opened in 2011 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Cattelan has also exhibited at Skulptur Projekte Münster (1997), the Tate Gallery, London (1999), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (2003) and the Museum Ludwig, Cologne (2003), and participated in the Venice Biennale (1993, 1997, 1999, and 2002), Manifesta 2 (1998), Luxembourg, Melbourne International Biennial 1999, and the 2004 Whitney Biennial in New York. In 2004, Cattelan exhibited the controversial sculpture Untitled featuring 3 hanging kids for the Nicola Trussardi Foundation.

40|$|The center {{sampling}} technique {{is well suited}} when a population is naturally gathered in overlapping groups of units for which the units can not be labeled and the group size {{as well as the}} population size are unknown. An unbiased estimator Ym for the mean of a quantitative characteristic of interest has been proposed under the simple hypotheses that the relative weight of each center is known. A second estimator Yc can be deduced from a previous proposal under the same hypothesis. In the present paper the exact variance of Yc together with an estimate of it are given. The two estimators are based on different ways of summarizing data and they coincide in the case of proportional allocation of the overall sample size only. A comparison between the two estimators is accomplished both from the inferential and from the practical point of view. Through a simulation study it is shown that no estimator is uniformly more efficient than the other in the general case of L>_ 2 <b>centers.</b> Besides it <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> that Yc is more efficient when there is a "small" variability of the center sampling fractions, while Ym is more efficient as this variability increases. Simulation also shows that the proposed estimators for the variance are asymptotically unbiased, consistent and c-consistent...|$|R
5000|$|He was {{the first}} four-time MVP of the league, winning it in even {{numbered}} years during the 1980s—1982, 1984, 1986, and 1988. Considered as the best <b>center</b> to have <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the PBA, he can however play all five positions on the court with uncanny ability. His trademark one-handed running jumper dubbed the [...] "elegant shot" [...] was his most potent offensive weapon. In 1984, he came awfully close to averaging in triple-double the whole season, being only five assists shy from achieving the feat. He ended his PBA career as the all-time leader in most points scored with 18,996, number two behind Jaworski in assists with 5,220, number one in defensive rebounds with 6,435, number two in offensive rebounds behind Guidaben with 2,217, number one in overall rebounds with 8,652, number one in minutes played with 36624:30, number 2 in games played behind Guidaben, number one in blocks with 1,853, and, only since February 5, 2007, number two behind Johnny Abarrientos in steals with 1,302 (He retired number one in steals in 1994). He ended with career averages of 17.7 points per game, 8.1 rebounds per game, 4.9 assists per game, 1.2 steals per game, and 1.7 blocks per game in 1,074 games.|$|R
40|$|From {{the first}} game of the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs on April 22, 1876, tens of {{thousands}} of men have played professional sports in the Big Four—baseball, basketball, football, and hockey—major professional sports leagues in the United States. Until April 29, 2013, however, when National Basketball Association <b>center</b> Jason Collins <b>came</b> <b>out</b> publicly as gay, not one of those tens of thousands of men had ever <b>come</b> <b>out</b> to the public as gay while an active player on a major league roster. Is it because gay men can 2 ̆ 7 t jump (or throw, or catch, or skate) ? Or is it more likely that the costs of coming out are too high? In Antigay Bias in Role-Model Occupations, E. Gary Spitko argues that in the case of athletes, and others in role-model occupations, a record of widespread and frequently systematic employment discrimination has been excluding gay people from the public social spaces that identify and teach whom society respects and whom members of society should seek to emulate. Creating a typology of role models—lawyers/judges, soldiers, teachers, politicians, athletes, and clergy—and the positive values and character traits associated with them, Spitko demonstrates how employment discrimination has been used for the purpose of perpetuating the generally accepted notion that gay people are inferior because they do not possess the requisite qualities—integrity, masculinity, morality, representativeness, all-American-ness, and blessedness—associated with employment in these occupations. Combining the inspirational stories of LGBT trailblazers with analysis of historical data, anecdotal evidence, research, and literature, Antigay Bias in Role-Model Occupations is the first book to explore in a comprehensive fashion the broad effects of sexual orientation discrimination in role-model occupations well beyond its individual victims.

40|$|Temperature-humidity index, {{also known}} as thermal comfort index, {{represents}} an extremely used index in mass-media nowadays; it renders an apparent temperature, namely the temperature felt by human body that cools slower at higher values of the relative humidity due to {{the reduction of the}} evaporation rate. THI is calculated on the base of several formulas, which corroborate air temperature and relative humidity, the critical threshold being 80. By analysing the statistical date supplied by the Regional Meteorological <b>Center</b> Craiova, it <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> that the years with the highest number of days with THI values above 80 are 2000, 2001, and 2007 for the entire studied territory, when, during summer, the region was affected by numerous heat waves, which led to the frequent exceeding of the 40 °C value. The most affected area is located in the central-southern and eastern parts of the Oltenia Plain – 51 days with THI> 80 at Caracal in 2000, 47 days with THI> 80 at Bechet in 2001, and 41 days with THI> 80 at Băileşti in 2007. Regarding the monthly distribution, the most problematic months are, of course, July and August, when it is favoured the penetration of certain extremely hot air masses from northern Africa, as well as thermal convection. During the analysed decade, the highest monthly number of days with values above the threshold was registered at Caracal in August 2000 – 23...|$|R
