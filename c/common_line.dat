The units were equipped with both third rail and overhead wire collectors, so they could operate on the <b>Common</b> <b>Line</b> and on the Holmenkoll Line. The trains were a prototype for a new design intended to replace the aging T1000 stock, but the MX3000 was chosen instead, as the T2000 did not perform satisfactorily.

25|$|All human {{societies}} organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations {{between parents and}} children (consanguinity), and relations through marriage (affinity). These kinds of relations are generally called kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities and expectations of solidarity on the individuals that are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be regulated. Among the many functions of kinship is the ability to form descent groups, groups of people sharing a <b>common</b> <b>line</b> of descent, which can function as political units such as clans. Another function {{is the way in which}} kinship unites families through marriage, forming kinship alliances between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of incest taboo, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited—such rules vary widely between cultures. Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either cross or parallel cousins. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of kinship terminology in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity (nurture kinship).|$|E

40|$|Public {{transportation}} network reorganisation {{can be a}} key {{measure in}} designing more efficient networks and {{increasing the number of}} passengers. To date, several authors have proposed models for the “transit route network design problem” (TRNDP), and many of them use a transit assignment model as one component. However, not all models have considered the “common lines problem,” which is an essential feature in transit network assignment and is based on the concept that the fastest way to get to a destination is to take the first vehicle arriving among an “attractive” set of lines. Thus, we sought to reveal the features of considering the <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> problem by comparing results with and without considering the problem in a transit assignment model. For comparison, a model similar to a previous one was used, formulated as a bi-level optimisation problem, the upper problem of which is described as a multi-objective problem. As a result, although the solutions with and without considering the <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> showed almost the same Pareto front, we confirmed that a more direct service is provided if the <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> problem is considered whereas a less direct service is provided if it is not. With a small network case study, we found that considering the <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> problem in the TRNDP is important as it allows operators to provide more direct services...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The cryo-electron {{microscopy}} reconstruction {{problem is}} to find the three-dimensional (3 D) structure of a macromolecule given noisy samples of its two-dimensional projection images at unknown random directions. Present algorithms for finding an initial 3 D structure model are based on the “angular reconstitution ” method in which a coordinate system is established from three projections, and the orientation of the particle giving rise to each image is deduced from <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> among the images. However, a reliable detection of <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> is difficult due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the images. In this paper we describe two algorithms for finding the unknown imaging directions of all projections by minimizing global self-consistency errors. In the first algorithm, the minimizer is obtained by computing the three largest eigenvectors of a specially designed symmetric matrix derived from the <b>common</b> <b>lines,</b> while the second algorithm is based on semidefinite programming (SDP). Compared with existing algorithms, the advantages of our algorithms are five-fold: first, they accurately estimate all orientations at very low common-line detection rates; second, they are extremely fast, as they involve only the computation of a few top eigenvectors or a sparse SDP; third, they are nonsequential and use the information in all <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> at once; fourth, they are amenable to a rigorous mathematical analysis using spectral analysis and random matrix theory; and finally, the algorithms are optimal {{in the sense that they}} reach the information theoretic Shannon bound up to a constant for an idealized probabilistic model...|$|R

40|$|Headway {{fluctuations}} and “bus bunching” {{are well}} known phenomena on many bus routes where an initial delay to one service can disturb the whole schedule due to resulting differences in dwell times of subsequent buses at stops. This paper deals with {{the influence of a}} frequent but so far largely neglected characteristic of bus networks on bus bunching, that is the presence of overtaking and <b>common</b> <b>lines.</b> A set of discrete state equations is implemented to obtain the departure times of a group of buses following the occurrence of an exogenous delay to one bus at a bus stop. Two models are distinguished depending on whether overtaking at stops is possible or not. If two buses board simultaneously and overtaking is not possible, passengers will board the front bus. If overtaking is possible, passengers form equilibrium queues in order to minimise their waiting times. Conditions for equilibrium queues among passengers with different choice sets are formulated. With a case study we then illustrate that, if overtaking is not allowed, the presence of <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> worsens the service regularity along the corridor. Conversely, <b>common</b> <b>lines</b> have positive effects when overtaking is possible. We suggest hence that appropriate network design is important to reduce the negative effects of delay-prone lines on the overall network performance...|$|R
