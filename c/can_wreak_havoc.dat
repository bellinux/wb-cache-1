2500|$|The Cascade Mountain {{range is}} a {{defining}} feature {{in both the}} geography and climate of Washington state. It serves as a dividing line between the wet, marine influenced climate of {{the western part of}} the state from the drier, desert-like climate of the eastern half. The mountains themselves create a rain shadow over the eastern half by blocking weather fronts holding precipitation from carrying over the mountains and descending onto the Columbia River Basin. This creates the arid desert-like conditions with a more continental climate in Eastern Washington and heightens the roles of riversmost notably the Walla Walla, Yakima, Snake and Columbia River—in the region's viticulture. In addition to providing vital irrigation sources, the rivers also help to moderate temperatures during the winter which is prone to severe frost and freeze coming from the Arctic. In winter, overnight temperatures in the wine growing regions of Eastern Washington can drop to as low as [...] The sudden drop to these sub-zero temperatures can make the water in a vine's wood canopy quickly freeze which can cause the vine to literally burst open. The severity of these conditions <b>can</b> <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> on a year's harvest, as was the case in the Walla Walla AVA with the big winter freezes of 1996 and 2003.|$|E

40|$|The Stock Exchange is {{a market}} where stocks and shares are {{purchased}} and sold and capital is raised {{for the purposes of}} industry and both local and central government. 1 Markets for the trading of stocks and shares or securities have existed for centuries all over the world. One of the earliest known markets was established in Paris, France around 1138. 2 However, the modern form of the Stock Exchange can be traced to about 200 years ago. 3 By the twentieth century, the Stock Exchange had become a common feature in many capitalist economies and was widely considered an institution characteristic of a â€˜modern economyâ€™. The Stock Exchange is now recognised as an important cog in the financial structure of the capitalist system. While the Stock Exchange serves an important function in the economy, it <b>can</b> also <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc.</b> Nowhere is this clearer than {{in the case of the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, which triggered a global economic depression. ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{companies}} have been confronted with {{a new type of}} negative consumer behavior: consumers who have turned hostile and who are strongly determined to cause damage to the brand. Empowered by new technological possibilities, an individual consumer <b>can</b> now <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> on a brand with relatively little effort. In reflection of this new phenomenon, the authors introduce the concept of consumer brand sabotage (CBS). On the basis of different underlying motives, a conceptual framework distinguishes CBS (a form of hostile aggression: harming the brand as dominant motive) from other forms of negative consumer behavior, such as customer retaliation and negative word of mouth (instrumental aggression: harming a brand is only a means to achieve other objectives, e. g., restoring equity). This framework adapts insights from aggression and appraisal theories as well as qualitative interviews with actual saboteurs to a consumer-brand relationship context in order to develop an improved theoretical understanding of the under-researched phenomenon of CBS. The authors analyze the mental escalation processes of individual consumers toward CBS and develop a road map for future research...|$|R

40|$|In the near-weightless {{environment}} of orbiting spacecraft capillary forces dominate interfacial flow phenomena over unearthly large length scales. In current experiments aboard the International Space Station, partially open channels are being investigated to determine critical flow rate-limiting conditions above which the free surface collapses ingesting bubbles. Without the natural passive phase separating qualities of buoyancy, such ingested bubbles <b>can</b> in turn <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> on the fluid transport systems of spacecraft. The flow channels under investigation represent geometric families of conduits with applications to liquid propellant acquisition, thermal fluids circulation, and water processing for life support.

25|$|Saints Row 2 is an action-adventure {{video game}} set {{in an open}} world environment, {{offering}} the player a large open environment in which to move around. The player's character is capable of maneuvering through the environment, utilizing weaponry and engaging in melee combat warfare. After successfully completing the first game mission, the player is able to explore the environment and choose how they wish to play the game. Missions are unlocked by earning 'respect' points from minigames and side-missions and although completing missions is necessary for game progression, players can complete them at their own leisure. The player is granted the option of instantly retrying the missions should they fail an attempt. Numerous checkpoints save progress in each mission, and missions can be replayed from locations within the environment. Aside from attempting missions, the player can explore the environment, purchase items at shops {{and participate in the}} aforementioned mini-games and side-missions. The player <b>can</b> also <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> upon the environment which can provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative forces. The player can recruit members from a friendly gang and use a mobile phone to contact friends and/or businesses, as well as to input cheat codes. Entering cheats will disable Xbox 360 achievements.|$|R
5000|$|Hubbard's {{terminology}} is used {{so thoroughly}} in Scientology as to render many church materials incomprehensible under a standard English reading using only an English dictionary as reference.

40|$|Abstract Background Mutations {{resulting}} in the disruption of protein function are {{the underlying causes of}} many genetic diseases. Some mutations affect the number of expressed proteins while others alter the activity on a per-molecule basis. Single amino acid substitutions as caused by non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (nsSNPs) often disrupt function by altering protein structure and/or stability, but <b>can</b> also <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> by directly impacting functional binding sites. Given the experimental three-dimensional (3 D) structure of a protein, we can try to differentiate between the "effect on structure/stability" and the "effect on binding". However, experimental 3 D structures are available for only 1 % of all known proteins; the magnitude of stability change caused by a given mutation is more widely available. Results Here, we analyze to which extent the functional effect of a mutation can be predicted from the effect on protein stability. We find that simple sequence-based methods succeed in predicting functional effects of nsSNPs. In fact, such methods consistently outperform approaches that predict functional change through the application of binary thresholds to stability change. We also observed that if stability is affected, functional change is easier to predict than when stability is not affected. Conclusion Our results confirmed that stability change is somehow related to function change. However, we also show that the knowledge of stability changes in no way suffices to predict functional changes and that many function changing mutations have no effect on stability. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Flooding, {{either from}} weather events, rising sea levels or {{infrastructure}} failures {{are a major}} cause of death, disease and economic losses throughout the world. Climate change and rapidly expanding urban settlements are two factors that are leading to the increasing occurrence and severity of urban flood events, especially in the developing world. [...] Storm surges can affect coastal cities and are caused by low pressure weather systems, like cyclones and hurricanes. [...] Flash floods and river floods can affect any city within a floodplain or with inadequate drainage infrastructure. These can be caused by large quantities of rain or heavy rapid snow melt. With all forms of flooding, cities are increasingly vulnerable because of the large quantity of paved and concrete surfaces. These impermeable surfaces cause massive amounts of runoff and can quickly overwhelm the limited infrastructure of storm drains, flood canals and intentional floodplains. Many cities in the developing world simply have no infrastructure to redirect floodwaters whatsoever. [...] Around the world, floods kill thousands of people every year and are responsible for billions of dollars in damages and economic losses. [...] Flooding, much like heat waves and droughts, <b>can</b> also <b>wreak</b> <b>havoc</b> on agricultural areas, quickly destroying large amounts of crops. In cities with poor or absent drainage infrastructure, flooding can also lead to the contamination of drinking water sources (aquifers, wells, inland waterways) with salt water, chemical pollution, and most frequently, viral and bacterial contaminants.|$|R
