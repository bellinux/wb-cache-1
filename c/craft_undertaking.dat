40|$|In a globalizing {{and more}} {{integrated}} world economy, craft goods which are sourced from {{the developing world}} are increasingly {{becoming part of the}} decorative arrangement in first world households. While there has recently emerged detailed research on artisans and their integration into global markets, and on consumption more generally, there has been relatively little sociological research concerning the advertising and consumption of these artisanal products. In light of studies concerning the marketing of third world crafts, and based on content analysis of a number of web sites and catalogues marketing Asian <b>crafts</b> <b>undertaken</b> in 2004, this paper has two main aims. First, it analyses the various ways “ethnic branding” is an important marketing feature of a craft item and second, it aims to deconstruct the images and texts in terms of notions of “traditional”, “natural” and “authentic”. Underlying the analysis and interpretation is the notion of the commodification of poverty. The paper thus develops our understanding of the relationship between global markets, marketing of third world craft goods, and consumption practices...|$|R

50|$|Naval {{activity}} during the Winter War was low. The Baltic Sea began to freeze {{over by the}} end of December, which made the movement of warships very difficult; by mid-winter, only ice breakers and submarines could still move. The other reason for low naval activity was the nature of Soviet Navy forces in the area. The Baltic Fleet was a coastal defence force which did not have the training, logistical structure, or landing <b>craft</b> to <b>undertake</b> large-scale operations. The Baltic Fleet possessed two battleships, one heavy cruiser, almost 20 destroyers, 50 motor torpedo boats, 52 submarines, and other miscellaneous vessels. The Soviets used naval bases in Paldiski, Tallinn and Liepāja for their operations.|$|R
50|$|Maintenance {{facilities}} {{available to}} staging forces were the destroyer tenders Dixie and Markab; one limited repair ship, the Argonne; two repair ships, the Hector and Prometheus; one internal-combustion-engine repair ship; and two floating drydocks. Two landing-craft repair ships, Egeria and Endymion, which {{were assigned to}} the amphibious group, were available after 1 March. Because of the limited time in which to accomplish essential repairs and the length of time required to load ships, it was decided to place one repair ship in each of the two loading areas so that a maximum of work could be accomplished prior to departure. Work on small <b>craft</b> was <b>undertaken</b> by three of the other repair ships.|$|R
40|$|The {{promise of}} making” is a {{research}} project that investigates the validity of traditional notions of craft in our contemporary society, and examines how these notions are understood {{through the lens of}} consumption in a knowledge driven economy. The project simultaneously engages in a theoretical revision of <b>craft,</b> and <b>undertakes</b> a case study that interrogates the processes of learning the required skills to attempt to manufacture a pair of jeans from scratch. Through the reading of theory of craft, contemporary economic models and affects, I will first establish a framework for developing ideas of a reconfigured concept of craft. By examining the behaviours in these contemporary practices –and their relationship to the act of making– I will analyze how the optimism regarding access to knowledge, as well as the nostalgia for hand making perpetrate the illusion of a genuine and sincere craft...|$|R

The other reason for low naval activity was the nature of Soviet Navy forces in the area.

40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century the decline of the {{domestic}} knitting craft was of paramount concern to the yarn companies and retailers that served this market sector. As demand reduced in the UK so did the number of specialist retailers. This was as detrimental to the yarn companies as it was to the <b>craft.</b> Research <b>undertaken</b> in 1999 by the author suggests that it is probably true to say that the knitting craft was at that point in time at its lowest point of popularity throughout the entire twentieth century. This paper reports briefly on the reasons behind the rise and fall of the hand knitting craft’s popularity throughout the last century in the UK before focusing on the latter decades in order to expose the factors related to the more serious decline of the craft in the 1990 s. It discloses the perceptions of the craft at {{the end of the}} century and provides the foundation for the next stage of the research project which will involve an investigation of the craft in the early decades of the twentieth-first century...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Governmental {{pressure}} {{to raise the}} number of students entering Higher Education in the UK has seen more aggressive strategies being introduced in order to entice students to continue their education. An argument is raging among art and design academics to whether this expansion is wholly ethical, especially within art and design subjects where the professional opportunities are finite and often complex in their development. This paper looks at the relationship between the aspirations of students at entering university and after they have subsequently graduated. Studies undertaken by the authors are used to explore issues facing secondary school students when deciding upon undertaking Higher Education. The thoughts and reflections of graduates about their education and career progression are also investigated and key issues are documented about the intentions of students and career realities These key issues include: Are Universities honest about career opportunities within art and craft areas? Do students enter Higher Education in art and craft areas with the intention of becoming practitioners? How much parental influence underpins students' educational choices? What careers do art and <b>craft</b> graduates <b>undertake?</b> What are the reflections of graduates about their education and development of careers post graduation...|$|R

40|$|This article {{concerns}} perspectives on, and formative experiences of, {{crafts and}} cultural heritage reported by twenty exchange students from seven countries who studied Cultural Heritage and Craft Education in an International Study Programme at a University in Finland. The research is {{reported in a}} cultural ecological framework. Data were collected through individual and group activities concerned with students’ understandings of key terms, memories evoked by <b>undertaking</b> <b>craft</b> activities, values held about crafts and cultural heritage, and accounts of craft education. Results show that making craft artefacts evokes strong associations with people, places, artefacts, activities, feelings and sensations. Crafts are valued particularly for the way they connect with culture and the possibilities they offer for self-expression. Cultural heritage is associated with crafts but relationships between the two are not taught in schools. The significance of the research concerns the case made for connecting crafts and cultural heritage in a broader conceptualisation of arts education...|$|R

A visitor watched the nuns using GPS systems, computers and modern kitchen tools. They can be heard (but not seen) singing their regular services. The nuns have recorded their Vespers, which they perform every day. A first recording was made in 1973 and contained only two works by Hildegard of Bingen, a Kyrie and O virga ac diadema. A second recording appeared in 1979, to remember the 800th anniversary of Hildegard's death, including the same pieces and antiphones, a hymn, a responsory and parts of Ordo virtutum. In 1989, a third recording appeared, conducted by P. Johannes Berchmans Göschl, a scholar of Gregorian chant. A reviewer of Gramophone noted about a 1998 recording: [...] "These nuns are living the same life as that of Hildegard's community, singing daily the same Benedictine Office, breathing the same air and trying to capture the spirit of their great twelfth-century predecessor." ...|$|R

40|$|The aims of this {{research}} are to provide {{a comprehensive review of}} the available evidence for the socio-economic structure of the Urartian kingdom (of the 9 th- 6 th centuries BC) and by doing so, to analyse and critique previous interpretations of the subject. Although there has been intensive research on different aspects of the Urartian kingdom, mainly chronological studies or excavations and surveys that cover different parts of what was once the lands of the kingdom, unlike previous studies {{this research}} presents a systematic review of the geographical, archaeological and textual evidence of the Urartian (and Assyrian where relevant textual evidence is available) as well as original ethnographic observations in order to analyse the socio-economic and administrative organisation of the Urartian kingdom. After reviewing and evaluating the history of research of Soviet, Turkish and Western scholars on various aspects of the Urartian kingdom, I move on to investigating the available economic resources in the region and the movement of commodities such as the produce of arable agriculture, animal husbandry, metallurgy, and <b>craft</b> activities <b>undertaken</b> by Urartian society. The next step, {{in order to understand the}} management of these economic resources, is to examine the administrative organisation of the state including the Urartian concept of kingship and the king’s role in administration, construction activities, the administrative division of the kingdom, and the income generated by warfare. It is concluded that the Urartian state economy was heavily dependent on agriculture and animal husbandry. Military expeditions generated substantial income in the form of livestock and prisoners of war. Further wealth was accumulated by tribute, taxation and metallurgical activities. However, how these factors combined into a single economic system has been variously interpreted by individual scholars in response to their contemporary theoretical and political context...|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{identify}} socio-psychological predictors of mortality during a 20 -year follow-up period among people aged 65 to < 85 and 85 + at baseline interview. Study design and setting: elderly people {{living at home}} in East London and mid-Essex, who responded to surveys of successful survival in older age in the late 1980 s; their mortality was traced through the National Health Central Registry. Results: adjusted analyses show that, as expected, the hazard rate for mortality over a 20 -year follow-up was reduced for younger respondents and increased for less functionally able respondents. The hazard ratio for males was almost {{one and a half}} times that of females. The hazard rate was also reduced with each categorical increase in life satisfaction and was consistently reduced for those who <b>undertook</b> <b>crafts,</b> social visiting and activities regularly. There was some variation by age and sex. Conclusion: the results show that social participation is associated with lower risks of death, particularly among people aged 65 to < 85, and that life satisfaction is also protective, particularly among females and people aged 85 +, even when health status and socio-demographic circumstances are controlled. The study thus provides support for the hypothesised influence of social participation and subjective well-being on survival in older age...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} to produce a design {{solution}} from a specification by a fictitious client. It is intended to replicate a common scenario found in the yacht design industry. The brief was to design an aluminium hulled yacht to accommodate {{a family of four}} plus guests and provide facilities for SCUBA diving with an integral garage for the tender. Aesthetics were important to the client, who expressed a desire for uncluttered decks and sleek lines. The yacht needed to be capable of being sailed short handed. In this case, the client is both the author and the designer and the design is loosely based around his interests. The type of yacht chosen was seen to be more challenging from a designer’s point of view as apposed to a racing yacht, for example, where there are fewer compromises and design decisions are clearer cut. The project began with research into tenders and dive boats as garaging, combined with accommodation for eight passengers would determine the general arrangement and size of the vessel. The process was carried out this way as client had not specified the length of the yacht, but its practical requirements. From this a study was carried out on vessels of the appropriate size and the initial parametrics were produced and the design spiral started. The finished design was for a seventy foot yacht, 15 foot wide. It included a stern garage for the tender, also housing the liferaft and compressor. To double cabins with en-suites and two single cabins with additional ‘Pullman’ berths and a shared head were arranged as close to amidships as possible. This reduced seaway accelerations, creating a layout that was both practical and comfortable for passengers. A large galley and saloon was placed on the port side. A two-rudder configuration was selected to counter balance the problems associated with the wide flat hull. Other specific design features included: - a self tacking jib and automated sailing controls. A safety survey of the <b>craft</b> was <b>undertaken</b> and full range of safety features were incorporated into the design. Challenges of this design included the general arrangement and the logistics of fitting a large tender into a comparatively small boat. Performance from the specified metal hull needed to be enhanced without compromising safety or comfort, whilst all the time maintaining an aesthetically pleasing desig...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} issues of crafting a constitution for Nigeria that would meet the criteria of being visible, sustainable, and durable for national political unity, social and economic development. Specifically, it focuses on the years 1978 — 1995 during which several high profile systematic, constitution <b>crafting</b> exercises were <b>undertaken.</b> These included {{the establishment of a}} Constitution Drafting Committee to craft a constitution, and a Constituent Assembly. Ultimately, these exercises have proven to be only partially successful. The goal of producing an endurable constitutional framework for Nigerian politics remains elusive. The two core questions pursued in this dissertation focus on: Why did the military pursue these constitution crafting activities? What are the pressing political issues that the constitutional framework will have to manage? The dissertation pursued these issues through surveys, interviews, a review of government documents and reports, participant observation, and a review of existing literature regarding constitution development, federalism and Nigerian history and politics. Key research findings uncovered pressing political concerns ranging across ethnic fears, gender and youth concern, institutional restructuring and economic subordination. Our findings also related to the elite background of participants in these constitutional exercises, and the intrusion of religion, class, and geographical interests into the deliberations of the assemblies. The continued violation of constitutional provisions by the military was highlighted. The widespread call for a Sovereign National Constitutional Conference to shape a new popular constitution for the country was also a prominent concern. Key recommendations focus on the need for a national constitutional conference free of political interference and constricting mandates...|$|R
40|$|The Inflatable Rescue Boat (IRB) {{is arguably}} the most {{effective}} rescue tool used by the Australian surf lifesavers. The exceptional features of high mobility and rapid response have enabled it to become an icon on Australia's popular beaches. However, the IRB's extensive use within an environment that is as rugged as it is spectacular, has led it to become a danger to those who risk their lives to save others. Epidemiological research revealed lower limb injuries to be predominant, particularly the right leg. The common types of injuries were fractures and dislocations, as well as muscle or ligament strains and tears. The concern expressed by Surf Life Saving Queensland (SLSQ) and Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA) led to a biomechanical investigation into this unique and relatively unresearched field. The aim of the research was to identify the causes of injury and propose processes that may reduce the instances and severity of injury to surf lifesavers during IRB operation. Following a review of related research, a design analysis of the <b>craft</b> was <b>undertaken</b> as an introduction to the craft, its design and uses. The mechanical characteristics of the vessel were then evaluated and the accelerations applied to the crew in the IRB were established through field tests. The data were then combined and modelled in the 3 -D mathematical modelling and simulation package, MADYMO. A tool was created to compare various scenarios of boat design and methods of operation to determine possible mechanisms to reduce injuries. The results of this study showed that under simulated wave loading the boats flex around a pivot point determined by the position of the hinge in the floorboard. It was also found that the accelerations experienced by the crew exhibited similar characteristics to road vehicle accidents. Staged simulations indicated the attributes of an optimum foam in terms of thickness and density. Likewise, modelling of the boat and crew produced simulations that predicted realistic crew response to tested variables. Unfortunately, the observed lack of adherence to the SLSA footstrap Standard has impeded successful epidemiological and modelling outcomes. If uniformity of boat setup can be assured then epidemiological studies will be able to highlight the influence of implementing changes to the boat design. In conclusion, the research provided a tool to successfully link the epidemiology and injury diagnosis to the mechanical engineering design through the use of biomechanics. This was a novel application of the mathematical modelling software MADYMO. Other craft can also be investigated in this manner to provide solutions to the problem identified and therefore reduce risk of injury for the operators...|$|R
