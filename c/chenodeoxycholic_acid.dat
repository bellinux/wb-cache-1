50|$|Hyodeoxycholic acid {{undergoes}} glucuronidation {{in human}} liver and kidneys. Glucuronidation of hyodeoxycholic and hyocholic acids was observed to occur extensively at the 6α-hydroxyl group, unlike primary bile acids which form 3α-hydroxy-linked glucuronides. This suggests an important pathway {{for the elimination}} of toxic and cholestatic bile acids, e.g. lithocholic and <b>chenodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> which can form hyodeoxycholic and hyocholic acids, respectively, after 6α-hydroxilation. The enzyme family responsible for glucosidation of hyodeoxycholic acid in human liver is UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. Both the UGT2B4 and UGT2B7 isoforms are able to glucuronidate HDCA. This is an example of redundancy in protection against harmful endogenous compounds provided by UGT isoforms, which present distinct but frequently overlapping substrate specificity. A common amino-acid residue that confers these two isoforms specificity to HDCA has been identified in 2006.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{patterns}} of bile acids and neutral sterols in the feces of five infants under 1 / 2 years of age, five children 4 years of age, and nine adult subjects without history of gastrointestinal diseases were studied by gas-liquid chromatography. Progressive changes in both bile acid and neutral sterol profiles were observed with maturation in infants and children. The {{patterns in the}} 4 year olds approached those observed in adults. In the infants under 1 #{ 189 }years, cholic and <b>chenodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> constituted 20. 7 ± 4. 8 % and 7. 5 ± 2. 3 % of the total bile acid in the stool, respectively. Deoxycholic and lithocholic acids made up only 4. 4 ± 1. 7 % and 2. 9 ± 1. 0 %, respec-tively. In the 4 year olds, the corresponding primary bile acids decreased to 3. 9 ± 1. 9 % and 5. 6 ± 4. 3 %, whereas secondary bile acids increased to 21. 3 ± 5. 4 % and 33. 2 ± 2. 2 %. Normal adults on regular mixed diets had only small amounts of primary bile acids (2. 4 ± 0. 5 % and 3. 4 ± 0. 6 % for cholic and <b>chenodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids).</b> The secondary bile acids in their feces were 34. 3 ± 2. 2 % and 38. 9 ± 2. 0 %, respectively.

40|$|The human {{gastro-intestinal}} tract hosts {{a complex}} and diverse microbial community, whose collective genetic coding capacity vastly exceeds that of the human genome. As a consequence, the gut microbiota produces metabolites from a large range of molecules that host’s enzymes {{are not able to}} convert.

40|$|International audienceDrug-induced {{intrahepatic}} cholestasis {{is characterized}} by cellular accumulation of bile acids (BAs), whose mechanisms remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to analyze early and progressive alterations of BA profiles induced by cyclosporine A, chlorpromazine, troglitazone, tolcapone, trovafloxacin, and tacrolimus after 4 -hour, 24 -hour, and 6 -day treatments of differentiated HepaRG cells. In BA-free medium, the potent cholestatic drugs cyclosporine A, chlorpromazine, and troglitazone reduced endogenous BA synthesis after 24 hours, whereas the rarely cholestatic drugs tolcapone, trovafloxacin, and tacrolimus reduced BA synthesis only after 6 days. In the presence of physiologic serum BA concentrations, cyclosporine A, chlorpromazine, and troglitazone induced early and preferential cellular accumulation of unconjugated lithocholic, deoxycholic, and <b>chenodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> that increased 8 - to 12 -fold and 47 - to 50 -fold after 24 hours and 6 days, respectively.

40|$|Biliary obstruction, {{a severe}} cholestatic condition, {{results in a}} huge {{accumulation}} of toxic bile acids (BA) in the liver. Glucuronidation, a conjugation reaction, is thought to protect the liver by both reducing hepatic BA toxicity and increasing their urinary elimination. The present study evaluates the contribution of each process in the overall BA detoxification by glucuronidation. Glucuronide (G), glycine, taurine conjugates, and unconjugated BAs were quantified in pre- and post-biliary stenting urine samples from 12 patients with biliary obstruction, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The same LC-MS/MS procedure was used to quantify intra- and extracellular BA-G in Hepatoma HepG 2 cells. Bile acid-induced toxicity in HepG 2 cells was evaluated using MTS reduction, caspase- 3 and flow cytometry assays. When compared to post-treatment samples, pre-stenting urines were enriched in glucuronide-, taurine- and glycine-conjugated BAs.

40|$|Background Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and its taurine {{conjugate}} (TUDCA) exert {{a protective}} effect in cholestatic liver diseases. A greater hepatoprotective effect of TUDCA has been suggested. Absorption {{appears to be}} a limiting factor and up to now has not been studied in man. Methods We studied absorption and biliary bile acid secretion and composition after administration of UDCA and TUDCA in patients who had complete extrahepatic biliary obstruction caused by pancreatic carcinoma but had no intestinal or liver disease. After 5 days of intact enterohepatic circulation eight patients with a percutaneous biliary-duodenal drainage received, during two study periods, 1000 mg (1916. 9 mumol; mean 29. 6 mumol kg(- 1)) TUDCA and 750 mg (1910. 4 mumol; mean 29. 5 mumol kg(- 1)) UDCA in random order. Each patient served as his own control. Results After UDCA and TUDCA administration the biliary UDCA content increased to 55. 2 % and 54. 6 % of total bile acids, respectively (not significant). Biliary secretion of cholic and <b>chenodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> remained unchanged whereas that of lithocholic acid increased slightly. A total of 64. 6 % of the orally administered TUDCA and 55. 1 % of the UDCA was absorbed (not significant). After TUDCA administration, biliary UDCA was preferentially (95. 4 %) taurine-conjugated whereas after UDCA administration biliary UDCA was mainly (79. 8 %) glycine-conjugated. Conclusions After oral administration of TUDCA and UDCA, no significant differences in their absorption and in biliary bile acid secretion exist.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of β-sitosterol {{was compared}} to that of cholesterol in 12 patients. Sterol balance methods were supplemented by radiosterol studies, with the following results. (a) Plasma concentrations of β-sitosterol ranged from 0. 30 to 1. 02 mg/ 100 ml plasma in patients on intakes of β-sitosterol typical of the American diet. Plasma levels were raised little when intakes were increased greatly, and on fixed intakes they were constant from week to week. On diets devoid of plant sterols, the plasma and feces rapidly became free of β-sitosterol. (b) The percentage of esterified β-sitosterol in the plasma was the same as for cholesterol. However, the rate of esterification of β-sitosterol was slower than that for cholesterol. (c) Specific activity-time curves after simultaneous pulse labeling with β-sitosterol- 3 H and cholesterol- 14 C conformed to two-pool models. The two exponential half-lives of β-sitosterol were much shorter than for cholesterol, and pool sizes were much smaller. Values of turnover for β-sitosterol obtained by the sterol balance method agreed closely with those derived by use of the two-pool model. There was no endogenous synthesis of β-sitosterol in the patients studied; hence, daily turnover of β-sitosterol equaled its daily absorption. Absorption of β-sitosterol was 5 % (or less) of daily intake, while cholesterol absorption ranged from 45 to 54 % of intake. (d) About 20 % of the absorbed β-sitosterol was converted to cholic and <b>chenodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids.</b> The remainder was excreted in bile as free sterol; this excretion was more rapid than that of cholesterol.

Early hepatic effects of chlorpromazine (CPZ), a neuroleptic drug {{known for years}} to induce intrahepatic cholestasis, were investigated using the differentiated human hepatoma HepaRG cells. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected as early as 15 minutes after CPZ treatment and was associated with an altered mitochondrial membrane potential and disruption of the pericanalicular distribution of F-actin. Inhibition of [3 H]-taurocholic acid efflux was observed after 30 minutes and was mostly prevented by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) cotreatment, indicating a major role of oxidative stress in CPZ-induced bile acid (BA) accumulation. Moreover, 24 -hour treatment with CPZ decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of the two main canalicular bile transporters, bile salt export pump (BSEP) and multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR 3). Additional CPZ effects included inhibition of Na+ -dependent taurocholic cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) expression and activity, multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP 4) overexpression and CYP 8 B 1 inhibition {{that are involved in}} BA uptake, basolateral transport, and BA synthesis, respectively. These latter events likely represent hepatoprotective responses which aim to reduce intrahepatic accumulation of toxic BA. Compared to CPZ effects, overloading of HepaRG cells with high concentrations of cholic and <b>chenodeoxycholic</b> <b>acids</b> induced a delayed oxidative stress and, similarly, after 24 hours it down-regulated BSEP and MDR 3 in parallel to a decrease of NTCP and CYP 8 B 1 and an increase of MRP 4. By contrast, low BA concentrations up-regulated BSEP and MDR 3 in the absence of oxidative stress.
