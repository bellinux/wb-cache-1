5|$|A halt {{was called}} for Christmas while {{supplies}} were brought up. Units had a rest day. Most dined on turkey, ham, roast potatoes and <b>Christmas</b> <b>pudding,</b> and Christmas services were held. General Blamey insisted that Christmas fare be available to all units, and extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} carry out his directive. In one instance, a Piper Cub of No. 4 Squadron RAAF dropped Christmas fare to a Papuan Company on a long range patrol. The advance resumed on 27 December, preceded by air strikes by 18 B-25 Mitchell and 12 Boston bombers. The 2/15th Infantry Battalion and tanks of A Squadron, 1st Tank Battalion took the lead on 31 December; they reached Sialum on 2 January 1944. This had a sheltered beach which served as a maintenance area. That day, the American landing at Saidor placed a large force across the Japanese escape route.|$|E

25|$|Christian cooking {{combines}} {{the food of}} many cultures in which Christian have lived. A special Christmas family meal is traditionally {{an important part of}} the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. Some regions, such as Sicily, have special meals for Christmas Eve, when 12 kinds of fish are served. In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider. Special desserts are also prepared, such as <b>Christmas</b> <b>pudding,</b> mince pies, fruit cake and Yule log.|$|E

25|$|The liquid used in Snap-dragon was {{typically}} brandy, although similar flammable liquors {{could also be}} used. Traditionally, raisins were the treat to be snatched; William Sandys specifies Málaga raisins. Other treats, however, could also be used. Of these, almonds were the most common alternative or addition, but currants, candied fruit, figs, grapes, and plums also featured. Salt could also be sprinkled in the bowl. The low bowl {{was typically}} placed {{in the middle of}} a table to prevent damage from the inevitable splashes of burning brandy. In one variation a <b>Christmas</b> <b>pudding</b> is placed in the centre of the bowl with raisins around it.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} one of the first to list recipes for Eastern [...] "chatneys", both fresh, like her [...] "Mauritian shrimp chatney" [...] with lemon and oil, and preserved, like her [...] "Bengal chatney" [...] with raisins, crab apples, garlic, and ginger. The first known mention of <b>Christmas</b> <b>pudding,</b> too, is in the first edition of 1845; the dish had earlier been known simply as plum pudding. Her recipe for {{mincemeat}} (as in mince pies) still contained meat – she suggests ox tongue or beef sirloin – which she combined with lemons [...] "boiled quite tender and chopped up entirely with the exception of the pips".|$|E
500|$|Plum cakes {{were raised}} by {{whipping}} air into the cake batter, {{rather than by the}} use of yeast. A range of plum cakes and puddings were published in the popular Book of Household Management (published 1859-1861) by Isabella Beeton. Mrs Beeton included recipes for [...] "A Common Plum Cake" [...] and [...] "A Nice Plum Cake" [...] as well as [...] "Baked Plum-Pudding", [...] "An Unrivalled Plum-Pudding", [...] "A Plain <b>Christmas</b> <b>Pudding</b> for Children", [...] "Plum-Pudding of Fresh Fruit", [...] "Plum Tart", [...] "Christmas Plum-Pudding", [...] "A Pound Plum Pudding" [...] and [...] "Christmas Cake". The comment in an Indian Household Management book is indicative both of the reach of Mrs Beeton's book as well as the range of interpretations of plum cake and plum pudding. The author says, [...] "Mrs Beeton’s recipe is by far the best if modified a little: 12 units of manukka raisins ..." ...|$|E

500|$|As a {{means of}} augmenting the meagre {{allowance}} provided by her father, Mitford began writing, encouraged by Waugh. Her first efforts, anonymous contributions to gossip columns in society magazines, led to occasional signed articles, and in 1930 The Lady engaged her to write a regular column. That winter, she embarked on a full-length novel, Highland Fling, in which various characters—mostly identifiable among her friends, acquaintances and family—attend a Scottish house-party which develops chaotically. The book made little impact when {{it was published in}} March 1931, and she immediately began work on another, <b>Christmas</b> <b>Pudding.</b> Like the earlier novel, the plot centres on a clash between the [...] "Bright Young People" [...] and the older generation. Hamish Erskine is clearly identifiable in the character of [...] "Bobby Bobbin", and John Betjeman is the basis for the supporting role of Bobby's tutor. The thinly disguised caricatures pervading the book shocked Lady Redesdale, who thought it could not possibly be published under Mitford's own name.|$|E
500|$|Scott, Wilson and Shackleton left on 2 November 1902 {{with dogs}} and {{supporting}} parties. Their goal was [...] "to {{get as far}} south {{in a straight line}} on the Barrier ice as we can, reach the Pole if possible, or find some new land". The first significant milestone was passed on 11 November, when a supporting party passed Borchgrevink's Farthest South record of 78°50′. However, the lack of skill with dogs was soon evident, and progress was slow. After the support parties had returned, on 15 November, Scott's group began relaying their loads (taking half loads forward, then returning for the other half), thus travelling three miles for every mile of southward progress. Mistakes had been made with the dogs' food, and as the dogs grew weaker, Wilson was forced to kill the weakest as food for the others. The men, too, were struggling, afflicted by snow blindness, frostbite and symptoms of early scurvy, but they continued southwards in line with the mountains to the west. Christmas Day was celebrated with double rations, and a <b>Christmas</b> <b>pudding</b> that Shackleton had kept for the occasion, hidden with his socks. On 30 December 1902, without having left the Barrier, they reached their Furthest South at 82°17′S. Troubles multiplied on the home journey, as the remaining dogs died and Shackleton collapsed with scurvy. Wilson's diary entry for 14 January 1903 acknowledged that [...] "we all have slight, though definite symptoms of scurvy". Scott and Wilson struggled on, with Shackleton, who was unable to pull, walking alongside and occasionally carried on the sledge. The party eventually reached the ship on 3 February 1903 after covering [...] including relays, in 93days' travel at a daily average of just over [...]|$|E

2500|$|The popular {{theory of}} atomic {{structure}} {{at the time}} of Rutherford's experiment was the [...] "plum pudding model". This model was devised by Lord Kelvin and further developed by J.

Thomson believed the atom was a sphere of positive charge throughout which the electrons were distributed, a bit like plums in a <b>Christmas</b> <b>pudding.</b> The existence of protons and neutrons was unknown at this time. They knew atoms were very tiny (Rutherford assumed they were in the order of 10−8 m in radius). [...] This model was based entirely on classical (Newtonian) physics; the current accepted model uses quantum mechanics.|$|E
