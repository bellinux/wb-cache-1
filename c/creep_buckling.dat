40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} buckling behaviors of a slender stainless steel column under compressive loads in severe accident conditions, which addresses the accidents in Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants. Firstly, buckling load, defined a load which generates {{a failure of}} the column (plastic collapse) was experimentally measured {{in a wide range of}} temperatures from 25 ºC up to 1200 ºC. The buckling load values measured were compared to numerical estimations for both an ideal column and for a column initially bent. Secondly, <b>creep</b> <b>buckling</b> tests were also performed for extremely high temperatures (800 ºC, 900 ºC, and 1000 ºC). <b>Creep</b> <b>buckling</b> was found to occur very quickly compared to general creep times under tensile stresses. Time to <b>creep</b> <b>buckling</b> was exponentially increased with decrease of loads applied. Lateral deflection of a test column was estimated using captured images by a high speed camera.

40|$|The {{offshore}} wind industry {{is growing at}} high pace and is already {{one of the major}} renewable energy sources in Europe. To support this growth, costs must be further decreased, amongst others by efficiently designing the support structure of the {{offshore wind}} turbines (OWT). This requires accurate prediction of environmental loading such as dynamic ice-structure interaction. From industry practice it is known, that current phenomenological models show results that are highly sensitive to the used input parameters. It is investigated if the methodology used in industry practice, can be improved by coupled phenomenological modeling of dynamic ice-structure interaction. The phenomenological model proposed by Hendrikse and Metrikine (2015) is implemented and extended with the <b>creep</b> and <b>buckling</b> failure modes. The input parameters of the model are derived from reference data that is obtained from full-scale measurements. A verification study is performed to demonstrate that the reference data is matched. Furthermore, a qualitative verification is performed on the failure modes and ice-induced vibration regimes. The phenomenological model is applied to a structural model of an OWT and investigated in two case studies. For the implementation of the structural model, firstly the phenomenological model for ice-structure interaction is adjusted for cylindrical structures. Aerodynamic damping and thrust are included to enable simulations of the ice-structure interaction during the production of electrical energy. The coupled model is applied in two cases. The first case considers an offshore wind turbine model with ice loading as the only subjected load to the structure. The second case considers the combination of ice and wind loading. A comparison is made between coupled and uncoupled models for ice-structure interaction. The uncoupled models use an external ice load series to represent the ice-structure interaction and are therefore based on methodology used in industry practice. In case of ice-only loading, it is concluded that the uncoupled model is not capable of capturing intermittent crushing and frequency lock-in behavior due to inconsistency between the load signal and the response. In case of combined ice and wind loading, it is concluded that the uncoupled model is incapable of capturing intermittent crushing behavior and ice-induced damping. The same inconsistency is used as an explanation. Mechanical, Maritime and Materials EngineeringOffshore and dredging engineerin...|$|R

Predictions of <b>creep</b> <b>buckling</b> with a temperature variation between {{the inner and outer}} plate surfaces are found to be somewhat dependent on the <b>creep</b> <b>buckling</b> relationship assumed.

The material for the larger specimens was type 304 stainless steel, while the smaller ones were made of both type 304 and type 347 stainless steel. The length chosen in each case was infinite from the buckling standpoint. The instantaneous-collapse test temperatures ranged from room temperature to 1200 deg F, and all the time- dependent collapse tests were made at 1200 deg F. The results show that tube out- of-roundness {{is a major factor}} in determining the collapse pressure. They also show that, under creepcollapse conditions, the critical pressure decreases rapidly with time, initially. This decrease is then followed by a leveling off, with very little change after the first few hundred hours. Although the load- carrying abilities of the 8. 0 -in. -OD specimens exceeded those for 4. 0 in. -OD specimens of the same material for instantaneous and short-time collapse conditions, the critical pressures were about the same in the two cases for collapse after several hundred hours. The ratio of experimental values to the allowable working pressure given by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII, Rules for Construction of Unfired Pressure Vessels, ranges from about 6. 0 for instantaneous buckling to about 3. 4 at 3400 hr {{in the case of the}} 8. 0 -in. -OD tubes.

40|$|Seven bedrock {{landslides}} situated within quartzofeldspathic schist exist {{up slope}} of the residential area along the Frankton Arm of Lake Wakatipu, South Island, New Zealand. Engineering geological and geotechnical failure models for these landslides have been established using engineering geological mapping at scales of 1 : 5000 and 1 : 10000, geotechnical testing, {{and the development of}} limit-equilibriurn sensitivity models. Geotechnical testing of artificially fractured schist bedrock obtained shear strength values of Φ = 24 °- 36 ° and zero cohesion, and point load strength indexes of 0. 6 - 3. 83 MPa for rock tested perpendicular to foliation, and 0. 11 - 0. 92 for rock tested parallel to foliation. Testing of shear zone material gave values of Φ 60 °- 110 ° and zero cohesion. The largest failure is the Queenstown Hill Landslide, with an estimated volume of 240 M m³ which is interpreted as a retrogressive translational landslide with the toe forming a compressional bulge in the mid-slope area of Queenstown Hill. Three phases of movement have taken place, the earliest phase probably being initiated in the southeastern area of the slide mass by ice scouring and the over steepening of slopes during the final stages of the Last Glaciation. On retreat of the glacial ice, lateral support was removed and increased pore water pressures may have acted to reduce the shear strength of the slope along critical failure or shear surfaces. Movement is inferred to have been by translational planar sliding by slow rock mass <b>creep,</b> not from <b>buckling</b> in the toe, partly along foliation shear zones and a stepped failure surface in fractured schist bedrock immediately following glacial retreat. The second and third phases of movement were initiated {{as a result of the}} removal of support by the previous phase, with the second phase forming small translational- slides and. retrogressive features, and the third phase forming the toe bulging by gravitational creep down slope. Six smaller bedrock failures (up to 2. 8 M m³ each in volume) are situated further east along Frankton Arm. These landslides are interpreted as shallow retrogressive translational failures, with their slide bases orientated sub-parallel to the schist foliation. These failures may have initially occurred following glacial retreat (similar to the Queenstown Hill Landslide), with the slides situated at lower elevations activated by seismic events at a much later stage following deposition of lake beaches as the enlarged Lake Wakatipu was lowering. The only evidence for continual movement for within the last 100 years is on Slide No. 3 and Slide No. 4. Minor wedge failures have occurred from the head scarp, but the high frictional interlock between the displaced blocks creates minimal risk to the residential areas below and if further development was to occur in these areas, prudent engineering geological practices should be implemented. Future sub-surface work needs to be completed to accurately locate the depth, shape and angle of the failure surfaces for each landslide. This work would also determine the parts of the failure surfaces that occur through foliation shear zones, or fractured schist...|$|R

Increasing creep deflections lead to column collapse in time at constant end loads which {{are smaller than}} the corresponding elastic critical loads. Consequently, creeping columns have a finite lifetime and failure may occur in two distinct modes, namely (A) creep collapse and (B) material failure due to increasing bending and shear stresses. In composites, the latter may lead to delaminations in time (Hilton et al. 1997 a).

40|$|Models of the {{nonlinear}} creep {{behavior of}} paper, {{and of the}} global buckling, local buckling and <b>creep</b> <b>buckling</b> of corrugated board have been developed. The studies of creep and buckling were limited to climate conditions with constant relative humidity. First the short-term elastic buckling of corrugated board panels was studied. Then an appropriate creep equation, based on the Schapery representation, for liner and fluting materials was developed and implemented in a finite element code to study <b>creep</b> <b>buckling</b> and time to failure of a corrugated board panel axially loaded in compression. Experimental tensile creep-recovery tests of 300 g/m 2 kraftliner (used for the facing of corrugated boards) and 150 g/m 2 semi-chemical testliner (used for the fluting) at 50, 70 and 90 %RH were made by a special designed tensile creep tester. Compression creep-recovery tests at 50 %RH was made using a compression creep tester developed at STFI. For the short-term loading case, the experimental global buckling and postbuckling deformation performance of a corrugated board panel {{was found to be}} in good agreement with the performance predicted by FE-calculation. The calculated local buckling load was however almost 2. 5 times higher than the experimentally observed local buckling load in the panel. This discrepancy between the experimental and calculated local buckling load was most probably due to development of global buckling before local buckling of the panel. For the long-term loading case, the Schapery equation was found to give a good representation of the creep behavior of the facing and fluting material and enabled reasonably accurate predictions of the creep behavior of corrugated board. The Schapery representation for paper was implemented in the finite element codes Ansys and Abaqus. In Ansys, the Schapery representation was described by using stress-strain isochrounes and failure of the material was considered by using a Tsai-Wu failure criterion based on a time independent failure strain in the CD and MD at each layer. This model with isochrounes and a material failure criterion was found to be suitable for calculating failure load for a given time to failure. In the calculations made by the finite element code Abaqus no simplification was made of the Schapery representation and no material failure criterion was used. This model is more accurate than the model with isochrounes stress-strain curves {{in the sense that the}} influence of stress redistribution on the creep is considered. The model is therefore suitable to study the creep strains of a corrugated board structure as function of time, both the in-plane strains and pre-failure out-of-plane displacements.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of limit load and reference stress {{have been widely}} used in structural engineering design and component integrity assessment, especially in Nuclear Electric's (formerly CEGB) R 5 and R 6 procedures. The referencestress method has been proven to be successful in problems pertaining to creep growth, rupture damage, <b>creep</b> <b>buckling,</b> and more recently, elastic–plastic fracture toughness. An approximate method of referencestress determination relies on prior knowledge of limit loads for various configurations and loadings. However, determination of the limit loads for the problems with complicated geometric forms and loading conditions is not a simple task. In the present paper, a numerical solution method for radial loading is presented, the mathematical programming formulation is derived for the kinematic limit analysis of 3 D structures undermulti-loading systems, and moreover, a direct iterative algorithm used to determine the referencestress is proposed which depends on the evaluation of limitload. The numerical procedure is applied to determine the limitload and referencestress of defectivepipelinesundermulti-loading systems. The effects of four kinds of typical part-through slots on the collapse loads of pipelines are investigated and evaluated in detail. Some typical failure modes corresponding to different configurations of slots and loading forms are studied...|$|E
40|$|A {{triangular}} flat {{shell element}} for large deformation analysis of linear viscoelastic laminated composites is presented. Hygrothermorheologically simple materials are considered {{for which a}} change in the hygrothermal environment results in a horizontal shifting of the relaxation moduli curves on a log time scale, in addition to the usual hygrothermal loads. Recurrence relations are developed and implemented for the evaluation of the viscoelastic memory loads. The nonlinear deformation process is computed using an incremental/iterative approach with the Newton-Raphson Method used to find the incremental displacements in each step. The presented numerical examples consider the large deformation and stability of linear viscoelastic structures under deformation-independent mechanical loads, deformation-dependent pressure loads, and thermal loads. Unlike elastic structures that have a single critical load value associated with a given snapping of buckling instability phenomenon, viscoelastic structures will usually exhibit a particular instability for a range of applied loads over a range of critical times. Both <b>creep</b> <b>buckling</b> and snap-through examples are presented here. In some cases, viscoelastic results are also obtained using the quasielastic method in which load-history effects are ignored, and time-varying viscoelastic properties are simply used in a series of elastic problems. The presented numerical examples demonstrate the capability and accuracy of the formulation...|$|E
40|$|R. L. CARLSON. 2 This {{paper is}} an interest. ing {{addition}} to the li terature on <b>creep</b> <b>buckling.</b> The aut. hor's analysis is pm't. icu-larly valuable because it illustrntes boll ' t. he variat ional method {{can be used to}} obtain results for problems which would be ex-tremely difficult to attack by more direct mcthods. In formulating his solution, the author bas in troduced an initial imperfection in terms of an initial twist. This is believed to be a realistic approach. An alternate approach, analogous to one of those used in column-creep buckling, might appeal ' to be to extend the conventional to rsional buckling analysis of a per-fectly strnight open tube by simply introduci ng time-depcndent moduli. Support for this type of approach might appear to exist in a recent report by Schlecbte [1 J, 3 who, after comparing experi-mental results for columns with predictions based 011 the varia-tional analysis and a time dependent-tangent modulus analysis, concludes: "In many cases, the results obtained from tho iso-c. hronous-tangent-modulus method were about as good as the re-sults obtained from the more involved theoretical methods. " This conclusion could be readily misinterpreted, so it is worth-while to examine it more closely. In particular, it is of interest to consider the influence of initia...|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} long-term {{behavior of}} slender high-strength concrete (HSC) panels in two-way action is investigated in this paper. A theoretical model that considers the geometric nonlinearity and {{creep of concrete}} is developed based on a time-stepping analysis. A rheological material model {{that is based on}} the generalized Maxwell chain is adopted to model the concrete creep. Von Karman plate theory is used to derive the incremental governing equations. The equations are solved numerically at each time step based on a Fourier series expansion of the deformations and loads in one direction, and using the numerical multiple shooting method in the other direction. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated through a numerical example and a parametric study. The numerical study shows that the model can effectively predict the time-dependent behavior of two-way HSC panels, where the out-of-plane deflection and internal bending moments increase with time {{as a result of the}} combined effects of creep and geometric nonlinearity. These effects may ultimately lead to <b>creep</b> <b>buckling</b> failures. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the effects of in-plane load level, load eccentricity and slenderness ratio. It is revealed that the long-term behavior of two-way HSC panels is very sensitive to these parameters...|$|E
