40|$|Abstract—Transponders (also {{known as}} polarimetric active radar calibrators or PARCs) are {{commonly}} used for radiometric calibration of synthetic aperture radars (SARs). Currently three methods for the determination of a transponder’s frequency-dependent radar cross section (RCS) are used in practice. These require either to measure disassembled transponder components, or a separate radiometric measurement standard (like a flat, metallic plate or a corner reflector), leading to additional uncertainty contributions for the calibration result. In this paper, a novel method is introduced which neither requires disassembly nor an additional radiometric reference. Instead, the measurement results can be directly traced back to a realization of the meter, lowering total measurement uncertainties. The method is similar in approach to the well known three-antenna method, but {{is based on the}} radar equation instead of Friis transmission formula. The suitability of the method is demonstrated by a measurement campaign for DLR’s three new Kalibri C-band transponders, completed by an uncertainty analysis. The method is not universally applicable for all transponder calibrations because (a) three devices are necessary (instead of only one for the known methods), and (b) the transponders must provide certain additional features. Nevertheless, these features have become standard in modern SAR <b>calibration</b> <b>transponder</b> designs. The novel, potentially more accurate three-transponder method is thus a viable alternative for transponder RCS calibration, ultimately contributing to synthetic aperture radars with a reduced radiometric measurement uncertainty. 1...|$|E

40|$|Polarimetric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) systems require verification and calibration of their polarimetric performance after launch. Dual-antenna <b>calibration</b> <b>transponders</b> with freely rotatable, linearly-polarized antennas {{are one of the}} most common calibration targets for this task. Because the transponders are used as a measurement standard, any misorientation of the polarization direction of the transponder antennas leads to characterization errors for the SAR instrument. In this paper, we present a novel calibration approach with which the polarization direction of linearly polarized antennas can be accurately determined; no additional reference antenna with a previously known polarization is required. The novel approach will reduce polarimetric <b>transponder</b> <b>calibration</b> errors in the future and will lead to a higher accuracy in calibrated, fully polarimetric SAR systems...|$|R

This Paper presents the comparison of two different antenna rotation concepts suitable for the development of precise polarimetric <b>calibration</b> <b>transponders.</b> After a review of the well-proven waveguide approach a novel cable-based approach is introduced and followed by measurement results showing the achieved performance in terms of magnitude and phase stability...|$|R
40|$|The VHF transponders of the ATS- 1 and ATS- 3 {{geostationary}} satellites {{were used}} in ranging and position fixing experiments. An interrogation signal was transmitted from a ground terminal to ATS- 3, which relayed it to the vehicle transponders. The vehicle that was addressed repeated the signal and its response was relayed back through both satellites to the ground terminal, where propagation times were measured; lines-of-position and fixes were computed. The 0. 43 second tone-code ranging signal contained a single audio tone frequency. Ambiguity was resolved and user craft identified by a simple digital code. Seven vehicles {{were used in}} the test: three aircraft, two ships, an oceanographic buoy, and a truck. Ionospheric and multipath effects were studied. It is concluded that a VHF system could have an accuracy of + or - one nautical mile for ships and aircraft if <b>calibration</b> <b>transponders</b> are used to monitor the ionosphere...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} of SAR signatures require an absolute radiometric calibration {{of the complete}} SAR system. The active reflector named as transponder is an effective SAR calibration device that can yield a larger radar cross section than a corner reflector, and decouple the transponder from the background scatterers, {{which can be used}} to calibrate the SAR for radiometry, polarimetry, and interferometry.

An accurate radiometric calibration of the whole SAR system is crucial {{to cope with the}} demand on high image quality.

40|$|Spaceborne {{synthetic}} aperture radars (SAR) are systems capable of acquiring high-resolution earth-observation data independent on {{time of day}} and weather. These SAR systems have to be calibrated before first use and at regular intervals. For these radiometric calibrations active targets with known backscatter, so called transponders, serve as an external reference. For determining the frequency-dependent radar cross section (RCS) of these transponders, different measurement methods are available. This paper gives an overview of four different strategies with a following uncertainty analysis according to the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM). After comparison with respect to accuracy and feasibility, a recommendation for the best absolute radiometric <b>transponder</b> <b>calibration</b> method is given...|$|R
40|$|The {{scatterometer}} on-board ERS- 2, earth-observation satellite {{developed by}} the European Space Agency, is an active real aperture radar instrument designed to measure the backscatter coefficient 0 from the earth. Its main utility is to measure physical parameters such as wind speeds and directions over the sea surface. Due to malfunctions of the on-board gyroscopes and even though a new attitude and orbit control system is used, the yaw-orientation of the spacecraft still exhibits random variations from the nominal attitude. This unpredictable attitude requires re-developing the calibration chain of the scatterometer instrument. Distributed targets, such as the rain forest, are used to perform a relative <b>calibration</b> while <b>transponders</b> situated at known locations in Spain permit an absolute calibration of the instrument. The scope is to expose the obtained results and the improvements brought by the new chain regarding the absolute calibration. An analysis of the received echo with a sub-pixel resolution (better than the nominal resolution) allows getting accurate transponder localization. The localization error is used to determine, among other quantities, the antenna mounting angles errors. Since the signal emitted by the transponders is calibrated, radiometric calibration is also possible, including determination of a large set of parameters such as the absolute gain of each antenna. The raw data quality (such as DC offsets, gain imbalance, phase imbalance) and the spatial resolution are also compute...|$|R

The technique processes elevation scans. The vertical plan is modelled by allocating M bins in the vertical directions. The forward modelling is defined by linearization of the radiative transfer equation around a reference model of the atmospheric parameter pattern. The goal is to estimate the atmospheric attenuation along the vertical path 3 km away from the radiometer location, where a <b>transponder</b> <b>calibration</b> device for the nadir looking RA- 2 altimeter on board of the ENVISAT satellite is positioned. Estimation is performed through inversion of the brightness temperature values observed at different elevation angles, provided a proper parameterization of the model space.

40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} radar (SAR) systems {{allow to}} quantitatively measure the radar backscatter of an imaged terrain region. In {{order to achieve}} comparability between measurement results, traceable radiometric calibration is indispensable. The central claim {{of the work is}} that nowadays, however, radiometric SAR measurements are not traceably calibrated. In order to resolve this problem, five contributions are made: (a) The new measurement quantity “equivalent radar cross section” (ERCS) is defined. (b) A numerical approach for linking the known quantity “radar cross section” (RCS) with the novel ERCS is introduced. (c) The effect of the chosen apodization functions on radiometric measurements is analytically investigated. (d) The novel three-transponder method is developed which allows accurate RCS <b>calibrations</b> of SAR <b>transponders.</b> (e) The method of hierarchical Bayesian data analysis is introduced to the field of radiometric SAR calibration. The achieved traceability for radiometric SAR measurements allows more accurate radiometric measurement results especially for modern, high-resolution SAR systems.

40|$|The passive {{calibration}} of the Radar Altimeter (RA) {{consists of}} characterizing the receiver gain by observing natural surfaces with known emission {{in the so-called}} noise-listen mode. It {{is based on the}} comparison between the simulated values of the brightness temperature impinging on the altimeter antenna, and the digital counts at the output of the altimeter receiver in the absence of echo. The proposed method aims to calibrate measurements of the backscattering coefficient performed by a spaceborne altimeter {{based on the assumption that}} the receiver gain is the main source of uncertainty. This paper focuses on the general approach undertaken to characterize the receiver and to simulate the brightness temperature at the top of the atmosphere observed by the Envisat RA- 2. The simulations rely on emissivity models for land and sea, as well as on atmospheric radiation models supported by a continuous flow of online data used as model inputs. To assess the accuracy, the model outputs are compared with observations from calibrated radiometers, namely the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager, with particular attention to the low-frequency channels (10 and 19 GHz). The new method has been first tested on European Remote Sensing satellite data and has been subsequently adopted for Envisat RA- 2 in the framework of the Envisat Calibration and Validation activities managed by the European Space Agency. The evaluation of the receiver gain at both Ku-band and S-band is presented and compared to the preflight values, as well as to <b>transponder</b> <b>calibration</b> done for Ku-band.

The purpose is to remove the bias between ASCAT backscatter data and the CMOD 5. n GMF output which allows these data {{to be used in}} place of ERS data in existing wind processing algorithms. The ASCAT Wind Data Processor, developed at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI), applies the bias correction factors to ASCAT data and uses CMOD 5. n to retrieve wind vectors in order to produce an operational wind product. This resulted in a stable and high-quality ASCAT wind product since February 2007. We validate this product by comparing it to the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) winds and buoy measurements. The bias correction factors indicate that ASCAT data and the GMF differ by roughly 0. 3 dB below 55 ◦ and up to 0. 8 dB above 55 ◦. A possible explanation lies in CMOD 5. n which has been poorly validated in this incidence angle regime. Validation of ASCAT data using the ocean calibration method confirms this result and also indicates that bias-corrected data are everywhere within 0. 3 dB of CMOD 5. n. The wind product validation shows an rms error of 1. 3 m · s− 1 in wind speed and 16 ◦ in wind direction when compared to ECMWF winds. This is better than the results achieved using ERS scatterometer data. Against buoy winds, we find an rms error wind component error of approximately 1. 8 m · s− 1. These results show that the ASCAT wind product is of high quality and satisfies its wind component accuracy requirement of 2 m · s− 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of space geodetic techniques {{over the past}} two decades has made it possible to measure the rotational dynamics of the Earth at the milliarcsecond level, improving our geophysical models of the Earth 's interior and the interactions between the solid Earth and its atmosphere. We have found that the rotational dynamics of Mars can be determined to nearly the same level of accuracy by acquiring Earth-based two-way radio tracking observations of three or more landers globally distributed on the surface of Mars. Our results indicate that the precession and long-term obliquity changes of the Mars pole direction can be determined to an angular accuracy corresponding to about 15 cm/yr at the planet's surface. In addition, periodic nutations of the pole and seasonal variations in the spin rate of the planet can be determined to 10 cm or less. Measuring the rotation of Mars at this accuracy would greatly improve the determination of the planet' s moment of inertia and would resolve the size of a planetary fluid core, providing a valuable constraint on Mars interior models. Detecting seasonal variations in the spin rate of Mars would provide global constraints on atmospheric angular momentum changes due to sublimation of the Mars CO 2 polar ice caps. Finally, observation of quasisecular changes in Mars obliquity would have significant implications for understanding long-term climatic change. The key to achieving these accuracies is a globally distributed network of Mars landers with stable, phase-coherent radio transponders. By simultaneously acquiring coherent two-way carrier phase observations between a single Earth tracking station and multiple Mars landers, Earth media errors are essentially eliminated, providing an extremely sensitive measure of changes in the differential path lengths between the Earth tracking station and the Mars landers due to Mars rotation. Time variability of the instrumental phase delay through the radio transponder may represent the limiting error source for this technique. <b>Calibration</b> of the <b>transponder</b> stability to about 0. 1 ns or less, over a single tracking arc of up to 12 hr, is sufficient to provide the decimeter-level determination of Mars orientation parameters quoted above. We will provide a detailed description of the multilander tracking technique and the requirements it imposes on both the lander radio system and the Earth-based ground-tracking system. This concept is currently part of the strawman science plan for the Mars Environmental Survey (MESUR) mission and complements many of the other MESUR science goals...|$|R
