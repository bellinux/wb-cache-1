30|$|Plated fabrics knitted with {{carded yarn}} and {{polyester}} fibre of high linear density showed higher thermal resistance and would feel warmer on initial skin contact owing to low thermal absorptivity.

30|$|Table  6 {{shows that}} {{moisture}} vapour transmission rate of carded and <b>combed</b> <b>yarn</b> fabrics decreased with {{decrease in the}} fibre linear density. Positive correlation was observed between fibre linear density and moisture vapour transmission rate as indicated by high values of coefficient of determination (Fig.  4). As the polyester fibre become finer, yarn diameter reduces with corresponding increase in specific surface area (Table  3). Higher specific surface area offers more resistance to transmission of moisture vapour and hence the observed decrease in moisture vapour transmission rate with increase in fibre fineness.|$|E

It was observed that trans planar wicking decreased with the decrease in polyester fibre linear density. As the fibre linear density decreases, number of fibres in the yarn cross-section increases resulting in large number of capillaries of small diameter (Das et al.  2008). Creation of smaller capillaries may create sufficient drag slowing the liquid movement (Varshney et al. 2010) and hence lower trans planar wicking of fabrics (RM 1.1 and RC 1.1) knitted with finer fibres.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Traveller has a {{great impact}} on yarn quality {{parameters}} specially hairiness. Yarn quality varies due to different traveller number. The traveller imparts twist to the yarn and enables winding of the yarn on the cop. However, cooperating assembly, the spindle is required for the winding operation. High contact pressure (up to 35 N/mm 2) is generated between the ring and traveller during winding, mainly due to centrifugal force. This research was established according to yarn parameter of hairiness, U%, IPI, i. e. imperfection index and end breakage rate per 1000 spindle-hr. It is very important for the technologist to understand this and act on them to optimize the yarn production. Specific number of traveller should be used for a particular count of yarn.

Results show that the strength of the mercerised yarn is highly affected by the cylinder normal pressure, warm rinsing tem-perature and caustic soda bath concentration, while the effect of the cold rinsing tempera-ture is observed only for higher qualities of cotton fibers and yarns. Increasing the cylinder rotation duration results in a reduction in the strength of carded yarns, but has little effect on <b>combed</b> <b>yarns.</b> Results also show that optimum settings are highly affected by the type of cotton fiber, yarn structure and number of plies, but the linear density of single yarn and the mercerising machine type have no significant effect...|$|R

In this work, the migration parameters such as Mean Fiber Position, Root Mean Squared (RMS) Deviation, Migration Intensity and Yarn Diameter have been measured using the Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) camera attached on a projection microscope. D–Type slot carded compact yarn, regular compact and regular ring yarn structures have been critically analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscope.

30|$|An {{increase}} in polyester fibre linear density from 1.1 dtex to 3.3 dtex resulted in corresponding {{increase in}} air permeability of carded (RC 1.1  < RC 1.3  < RC 1.5  < RC 2.2  < RC 3.3) and <b>combed</b> <b>yarn</b> fabrics (RM 1.1  < RM 1.3  < RM 1.5  < RM 2.2  < RM 3.3) (Fig.  3). The increase in air permeability with fibre linear density {{can be attributed}} to increasing yarn diameter with increase in fibre linear density. This in turn results in reduced specific surface area. Lower the specific surface area, lesser the drag resistance to passage of air through fabric and hence the observed increase in air permeability with the increase in fibre linear density. High porosity of plated fabrics knitted with fibres of higher linear density may also account for the increased air permeability. Other researchers (Raj and Sreenivasan 2009; Varshney et al. 2010) have also reported similar results in their studies.|$|E

Remazol Red RR, Remazol Yellow RR and Remazol Blue RR were used for this experiment. The study reveals that dye shade percentage effects on the linear density negatively.

30|$|The {{effect of}} fibre linear density on water {{absorbency}} of test fabrics {{is presented in}} Fig.  7. Water absorbency was observed to increase {{with the increase in}} polyester fibre linear density for both carded (RC 3.3  > RC 2.2  > RC 1.5  > RC 1.3  > RC 1.1) and <b>combed</b> <b>yarn</b> fabrics (RM 3.3  > RM 2.2  > RM 1.5  > RM 1.3  > RM 1.1). Increase in water absorbency with fibre linear density may be attributed to corresponding increase in fabric thickness and fabric porosity (Table  4). For the same yarn fineness, as the fibre fineness decreases, the number of fibres in yarn cross-section decreases, which may result in increased yarn bulkiness and availability of high pore volume in yarn structure. Large pores or a high total pore volume assists in higher liquid volume retention, as suggested by Varshney et al. (2010). An increase in water absorbency of fabrics with increase in fibre linear density is therefore well justified in the light of above arguments. Combination of polyester fibre of higher decitex and carded yarn is seen to result in fabrics of higher water absorbency.|$|E

Factors like fibrous composition, properties of constituent fibers, wovens structure parameters, mechanical properties of {{warp and weft}} yarns and finishing treatments that influenced the recovery capacity from crease/folding were investigated experimentally through several tests which revealed their importance in the process. The creasing of woven materials made from <b>combed</b> <b>yarns</b> type wool used for ready-clothes is an undesired deformation effect with temporary or permanent character, which {{is caused by a}} composed strain of bending and compression during utilization, processing or maintenance. It is manifested by the appearance of wrinkles, folds or stripes on the surface of wovens materials, thus diminishing their qualitative appearance and also their practical value. Creasing is the result of irreversible changes created through the reciprocal sliding of structural fiber components when exposed to a bending strain. Creasing is specific to oriented structures with high crystallinity (cellulosic fibers). The sliding appears because of hydrogen bond breaking which can, however, reform easy in other positions conferring a permanent character to creasing.

Engineering fabrics with desirable thermo-physiological properties suited for specific applications such as active wear, intimate wear is a big challenge for textile manufacturers as gamut of fibre, yarn and fabric parameters are known to influence the thermo-physiological properties. The present study was undertaken with an aim to explore suitable combination of fibre and yarn variables for engineering polyester–cotton plated fabrics with good thermo-physiological properties. Categorical variables i.e. outer layer yarn type and inner layer fibre linear density were found to affect the thermal, moisture vapour and liquid moisture transfer properties of developed test samples. Fabrics knitted with carded yarn and polyester fibre of high linear density showed high thermal resistance and would feel warmer on initial skin contact owing to low thermal absorptivity. However, the air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate increased with combination of combed cotton yarn in the outer and coarse polyester fibre in the inner layer. <b>Combed</b> <b>yarn</b> fabrics were superior in trans planar wicking compared to carded yarn fabrics which showed higher water absorbency and would be slow drying fabrics.|$|E
30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} study the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort characteristics of woven and knitted fabrics. Varshney et al. (2010) studied the effect of fibre linear density on physiological properties of polyester woven fabrics and observed an increase in thermal resistance, trans planar wicking, air and water vapour permeability with fibre decitex. However they observed that thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and spreading speed of water drop decreased with increase in fibre coarseness. Das et al. (2008) reported reduction in air and water vapour permeability through the fabrics but increased wicking properties with the decrease in fibre diameter in their studies on micro-denier and normal denier filament fabrics. Ramakrishnan et al. (2009) compared the comfort properties of micro denier and normal denier viscose yarn knitted fabrics and observed better water absorbency and wicking for micro denier yarn knitted fabrics. Raj and Sreenivasan (2009) reported that the cotton fibre fineness had negative correlation with air permeability of fabrics woven from yarns having the same count and twist and suggested this outcome of reduced air spaces in the fabrics made from finer fibres. Oglakcioglu and Marmarali (2010) studied the effect of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of cotton knitted fabrics and observed that fabrics knitted with double plied yarn had higher thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and thermal resistance compared to single plied yarn fabrics. Singh and Nigam (2013) compared carded, combed and compact spun yarn woven fabrics for their comfort performance and reported that compact weft yarn fabrics showed high water vapour permeability while carded yarn fabrics showed higher thermal insulation. Ozdil et al. (2007) studied the thermal comfort properties of carded and <b>combed</b> <b>yarn</b> rib knitted fabrics and observed an increase in thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted with combed yarns. Nasrin and Nahida (2011) reported that combed yarns were stronger, less hairy and more uniform than carded yarns. Erdumlu and Saricam (2013) studied the wicking and drying properties of vortex spun yarns and knitted fabrics in comparison with ring-spun yarns and fabrics. They observed that vortex spun yarn had lower yarn and fabric wicking values and water absorbency rate than ring-spun yarns. Tyagi et al. (2009) studied the influence of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of woven fabrics and concluded that Murata Jet Spinning (MJS) yarn fabrics showed higher absorbency, air and water vapour permeability but lower wick ability compared to ring yarn fabrics. The review of published literature suggests that researches are mainly focused on studying the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort properties of woven and knitted fabrics. However, studies on the thermo-physiological properties of plated knits are very limited although the structures are fast becoming preferred choice as intimate wear owing to flexibility in engineering fabrics with different fibre and yarn combinations in the two distinct layers. Moreover, none of the reported studies suggest the desirable fibre and yarn combination in the two layers to engineer fabrics suited for particular environmental conditions. The present study was, therefore undertaken to explore the field further and {{to determine the effect}} of inner layer fibre linear density and the outer layer yarn type on thermo-physiological properties of plated knits.|$|E
