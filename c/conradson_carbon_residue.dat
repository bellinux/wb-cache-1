Crantz (camelina or false flax) and its mixtures with Brassica napus (rape) SVO as fuel in adapted diesel engines are described with chemical parameters, measurements {{in a test}} engine and a field test in a tractor. Camelina as a crop is attracting attention in organic farming and is often used in mixed cropping systems with low competition to food production area. Camelina SVO has low oxidation stability.

In mixtures with rape and camelina SVO, threshold limits for <b>Conradson</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>Residues</b> and for oxidation resistance were exceeded. The oxidation resistance could be prolonged by the addition of commercial antioxidants. Camelina and rape SVO showed very similar burning characteristics at full-to-medium partial engine loads. Under low partial loads and idle load, the burning function of the various fuels was increasingly delayed, beginning with diesel fuel over pure rape SVO, then a mixture containing 700 dm 3 m! 3 rape SVO, and 300 dm 3 m! 3 camelina SVO, through to pure camelina SVO. The exhaust emissions of NOx-, CO-, particles and HC of rape SVO, camelina SVO and their described mixture were not significantly different. The typically higher NOx- and lower HC-emissions of SVO compared to diesel fuel were apparent. The results principally reveal the usability of a cold pressed, non-refined camelina-rape SVO mixture in adapted diesel engines...|$|R
30|$|Feedstocks {{that are}} high in {{aromatics}} have low hydrogen content and therefore are resistant to conversion at typical FCC residence times. The production of propylene requires {{a disproportionate share of}} the hydrogen and co-products, including propane, and dry gas requires an even greater share of hydrogen.

30|$|The {{residue fluid}} {{catalytic}} cracking unit (RFCCU) of Khartoum Refinery Company (KRC) uses <b>conradson</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>residue</b> and metal-contaminated feedstocks (such as atmospheric residue or mixtures of vacuum residue and gas oils) to produce more valuable products (especially gasoline) using active zeolite catalyst in a circulating fluidized bed [1]. In the RFCCU, the oil feed and dispersion steam enter the catalytic riser reactor together with the regenerated catalyst, where cracking of vacuum residue into lighter hydrocarbons starts as it contacts the hot regenerated catalyst from the regenerator. The regenerated catalyst is made to rise by steam introduced {{at the base of}} the riser reactor between the regenerator and the feed inlet point. The vaporized feed and the catalyst pass through the riser reactor into disengager for cracked products and catalyst separation. During the cracking process, coke is deposited on the catalyst, and the spent catalyst flows down by gravity into the regenerator, where air is used to burn off the coke deposited on the catalyst in a combustion environment so that it is returned to a stable state for catalysing the cracking reaction. The hot regenerated catalyst is then re-injected into the base of the riser reactor [2]. The complexity of the typical FCCU feed makes it extremely difficult to characterize and describe the inherent kinetics at a molecular level. In this way, similar components are grouped into lumps. Therefore, lumping scheme has been used to study the reactions involved in the catalytic cracking of heavy oil. To give an insight into a comprehensive prediction of products’ distribution, there is an increasing number of lumps of the proposed models for catalytic cracking reactions [3]. In the first kinetic model of Weekman [4, 5] for catalytic cracking of heavy oil, three lumps were identified as gas oil (feedstock), gasoline, and light gas[*]+[*]coke as products, without incorporating diffusion characteristics of solid and gas phases. Lee et al. [6, 7] modified the three-lump model by splitting the light gas[*]+[*]coke lump into two different lumps of C 1 –C 4 gas and coke; therefore, resulting in the four-lump model for catalytic cracking of heavy oil. Corella and Frances [8] developed a five-lump model, in which the gas oil lump was divided into its heavy and light fractions. Different modified versions of five-lump model were developed by Dupain et al. [9], Kraemer et al. [10], and Ancheyta et al. [11]. Other proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil include: 6 -lump [1, 12, 13, 14, 15], 8 -lump [16], 10 -lump [17, 18], 11 -lump [19], 13 -lump [20], 14 -lump [21], and 19 -lump [22], without taking cognisance of diffusion resistance. A comprehensive review was presented by Pinheiro et al. [23] on the subject of {{fluid catalytic cracking}} process modelling, simulation, and control. Obviously, the number of lumps of the proposed kinetic models for catalytic cracking of heavy oil may be increased to obtain more detailed descriptions of the catalytic cracking reactions and product distribution [24, 25]. However, sparing kinetic investigations have been carried out with the incorporation of diffusion resistances. Taking into account mass and heat transfer resistances between the reacting fluid and solid phases helps with conceiving the lump concentration on the catalyst surface as well as temperature profiles of the fluid and solid phases. Flinger et al. [26] considered mass transfer between the fluid and solid phases in the FCCU-riser reactor model equation. Gupta and Subba Rao [27] and Nayak et al. [28] applied the relationship for Sherwood number proposed by Ranz and Marshall [29] in their model to demonstrate the effects of mass transfer. The lump concentration within the catalyst is reduced by intraparticle mass transfer. In this way, the presence of an internal concentration gradient reduces the average rate of cracking [30]. Pruski et al. [31] validated adsorption coefficients for the four-lump model of catalytic cracking of gas oil. Bidabehere and Sedran [32] set up a model to investigate the impacts of diffusion, adsorption, and reaction at high temperature inside commercial FCC catalyst pellets and analysed the significance of these phenomenon. Dupain et al. [9] discussed external and internal mass transfer relationships utilised for FCC riser.|$|E

50|$|Carbonaceous {{films are}} thin {{coatings}} which consist predominantly {{of the chemical}} element carbon. The soft tissues of organisms are made largely of organic carbon compounds and during diagenesis under reducing conditions only a thin film of <b>carbon</b> <b>residue</b> is left which forms a silhouette of the original organism.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers next offered {{self-cleaning}} ovens, {{which allows}} the oven to run at a special high temperature setting, effectively burning food residue to ash. Early self cleaning ovens weren't thoroughly satisfactory. At worst, they left carbon stuck to the oven surfaces. At best, they left <b>carbon</b> <b>residue</b> on the oven floor.|$|R
50|$|The fossil {{evidence}} of fire comes mainly from charcoal. The earliest charcoal {{dates to the}} Silurian period. Charcoal results from organic matter exposed to high temperatures, which drives off volatile elements and leaves a <b>carbon</b> <b>residue.</b> Charcoal differs from coal, which is the fossilised remains of living plants and burns to leave soot.|$|R
40|$|Combustion {{behavior}} of pulverized coals (PC), gasification and thermal annealing of cokes were investigated under controlled environments. Physical and chemical properties of PCI, coke and <b>carbon</b> <b>residues</b> of blast furnace dust/sludge samples were characterized. The strong influence of carbon structure and minerals on PCI reactivity was demonstrated. A technique to characterize char carryover in off gas emissions was established...|$|R
40|$|The biomass {{thermoplastic}} composites {{were prepared}} by extrusion molding method with poplar flour, rice husk, cotton stalk and corn stalk. The thermo gravimetric analyzer (TGA) {{has also been}} used for evaluating the pyrolysis process of the composites. The {{results showed that the}} pyrolysis process mainly consists of two stages: biomass pyrolysis and the plastic pyrolysis. The increase of biomass content in the composite raised the first stage pyrolysis peak temperature. However, the <b>carbon</b> <b>residue</b> was reduced and the pyrolysis efficiency was better because of synergistic effect of biomass and plastic. The composite with different kinds of biomass have similar pyrolysis process, and the pyrolysis efficiency of the composite with corn stalk was best. The calcium carbonate could inhibit pyrolysis process and increase the first stage pyrolysis peak temperature and <b>carbon</b> <b>residue</b> as a filling material of the composite.
