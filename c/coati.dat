5|$|Who's That Girl: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is {{the first}} soundtrack album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Madonna. It was released on July 21, 1987 by Sire Records to promote the film of the same name. It also contains songs by her label mates Scritti Politti, Duncan Faure, Club Nouveau, <b>Coati</b> Mundi and Michael Davidson. The soundtrack is credited as a Madonna album, despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album. After the commercial success of her film Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Madonna wanted to act in another comedy film titled Slammer, about a woman named Nikki Finn who was falsely accused of homicide. However, due to the critical and commercial failure of her adventure film Shanghai Surprise (1986), Warner Bros. were initially reluctant to green light the project, but later agreed, after Madonna convinced them and also {{because they wanted to}} cash in on Madonna's success with soundtracks.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack {{from the}} film was {{released}} on July 21, 1987, by Sire Records, and contains four songs by Madonna, and others by her label mates Scritti Politti, Duncan Faure, Club Nouveau, <b>Coati</b> Mundi and Michael Davidson. It is considered a Madonna album by Warner Bros. Records since {{the majority of the}} songs are sung by her. Madonna began working on the soundtrack in December 1986, and contacted Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, both producers of her third studio album True Blue (1986). She needed uptempo and downtempo songs for the soundtrack. The uptempo song, composed by Leonard, ended up being the title track for the film; together, Madonna and Leonard also developed the downtempo ballad [...] "The Look of Love". Two more songs were composed for the film with Bray, the first being the dance-y tune [...] "Causing a Commotion", and the other being [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas.|$|E
500|$|Robert Christgau {{gave the}} album a (C–) and said [...] "From Scritti Politti and <b>Coati</b> Mundi you expect trickier spin, but they're outsiders, and outsiders times soundtrack equals {{contract}} work. For her own movie, though, the decade's purest pop icon should {{do better than}} sloppy seconds. Or neat seconds—worse still." [...] Ed Blank from Pittsburgh Press commented: [...] "It feels like the sole purpose to create the soundtrack was to show it in the film." [...] Jay Boyar from Orlando Sentinel praised the songs on the soundtrack, claiming that [...] "Madonna brings forth a heart-breaking warmth in 'The Look of Love' and a club stomping feel with 'Causing a Commotion'. With the movie's fate being sealed, luckily for her Madonna can sing." [...] Gyan Singh from The Miami Herald, while reviewing the film, said that the [...] "Only solace of the movie is the soundtrack, the songs—especially those by Madonna—are actually good." [...] Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times, while reviewing Madonna's Who's That Girl World Tour, said that [...] "the soundtrack's songs sound good live". Larry Geller from The Advocate gave a positive review, saying that [...] "Who's That Girl will be the soundtrack album of the summer." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times gave an equally positive review, saying that the [...] "soundtrack album is full of engaging pop fluff. One of the hottest singles of the year, Madonna's bilingual title song has the buoyant bounce of an acrobat doing somersaults on a trampoline. 'The Look of Love' is as memorable a ballad as [...] 'Live to Tell', and '24 Hours', sung by Duncan Faure, skillfully fuses Beatles-styled vocals with 80's synthesizer-pop underpinnings." [...] Daniel Brogan from Chicago Tribune said that [...] "since this soundtrack isn't really a Madonna album, this {{is no surprise that}} it appears as incomplete." ...|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack {{album was}} not well {{received}} by music critics, some of whom went on comment that the title track is the record's highlight. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review, though Noah Robischon from the same magazine complimented the title track, saying that Madonna had [...] "pushed synergy over the borderline." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com said that the songs were not among Madonna's best music. Taraborrelli commented that [...] "the soundtrack was once again the reminder of Madonna's power and status {{as one of the}} most important singers of the 80s, because it was only her songs which gained prominence, albeit not being her best, though 'The Look of Love' is an exotic ballad." [...] Author Mary Cross, in her biography Madonna: A Biography said that [...] "the soundtrack slips up because of the film." [...] Allen Metz and Carol Benson, authors of The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary, said that [...] "Who's That Girl has done what it was released for, put money in Warner's pockets, but [...] nothing in Madonna's catalogue".

But it's just that it has the misfortune of being associated with such an unfortunate movie, that the album actually does not hold up to you well." [...] He added that [...] "The Look of Love" [...] was a hidden gem in Madonna's catalogue. Don Shewey from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "although essentially a Madonna album, the soundtrack does not boast a truly memorable song, rather there is the inclusion of the failed Warner artist songs, like the <b>Coati</b> Mundi song 'El Coco Loco' and Duncan Faure's uncannily Beatles-esque [...] "24 Hours". For most buyers though this album is the new Madonna album." ...|$|E
500|$|Casting for {{the film}} began as soon as Madonna had signed up for it. Griffin Dunne was signed to play the part of Loudon Trott, a lawyer whose job was to help Nikki get on a bus, after she was released. Initially Madonna had thought of asking Penn to play the part of Detective Bellson, but Penn was serving a 60-day jail term, having {{violated}} the probation he received in 1986, for assaulting a friend of Madonna and attacking an extra {{on the set of}} At Close Range. The part went to Robert Swan, followed by the signing of John McMartin, Haviland Morris and Bibi Besch as Trott's father-in-law, fiancée, and mother-in-law [...] respectively. Madonna herself commented that she had a lot in common with the character Nikki. [...] "She's courageous and sweet and funny and misunderstood. But she clears her name in the last, and that's always good to do. I'm continuously doing that with the public. I liked Nikki's tough side and her sweet side. The toughness is only a mask for the vulnerability she feels inside." [...] Madonna was also offered the lead role in the Blake Edwards comedy film Blind Date opposite to Bruce Willis, but she refused it in favor of Slammer. She said, [...] "The thing I had planned to do after Shanghai Surprise was Blind Date at Tri-Star. I was supposed to have the approval of the director and the leading man, but they didn't tell me they'd already hired Bruce Willis. That... just didn't work out. But I was really excited about doing a real physical, screwball comedy, so when Jamie brought this up, it was like my reward." [...] <b>Coati</b> Mundi, member of Kid Creole and the Coconuts, and Madonna's long-time friend joined the cast {{to play the role of}} Raoul, Nikki's enemy. Costume designer Deborah Scott was signed to create the wardrobe {{for the film}}. Madonna, who visualized the character of Nikki as a dizzy screwball blond, started watching the screwball comedies of the sixties, especially the work of actors like Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard and Judy Holiday. She asked Scott to create comical rah-rah and ballet tutu skirts for the character, with fishnet tights and loud make-up. Scott also designed a glamorous Monroe-esque dress for the love scene between her and Dunne.|$|E
500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and <b>Coati</b> Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E

The vegetation at this layer generally consists of shade-tolerant shrubs, herbs, small trees, and large woody vines which climb into the trees to capture sunlight. Only about 5% of sunlight breaches the canopy to arrive at the understory causing true understory plants to seldom grow to 3 m (10feet).
