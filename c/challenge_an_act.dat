The new law served to deregulate the television and radio industries which until then were still limited to the few channels created by the media law enacted in 1980. [...] A series of five judicial appeals and injunctions prevented it from coming into force for almost a year. The Supreme Court ruled against one of those appeals, declaring that it created a precedent where [...] "a single legislator could not <b>challenge</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of Congress, nor judges use their authority to stop the application of an entire law."

40|$|Individual {{human rights}} (political, civil, but also economic, {{cultural}} and social) may be threatened or violated through the actions, operations or policies of international organizations. Prior to any determination of responsibility of international organizations, {{one has to}} analyze whether international organizations are bound by human rights obligations. In international law – as in any legal system – the protection of human rights can only be guaranteed by the availability of effective judicial remedies. Access to justice has fundamental importance for injured individuals. However, except for particular cases, no independent and impartial international court has yet been established before which private individuals can file claims against the international organizations. An individual claimant who wants to <b>challenge</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of an international organization has often no other option than to seek a remedy before national courts, which are barred from adjudicating such claims because of the immunity of jurisdiction enjoyed by international organizations. The purpose of the doctoral project is to identify an effective articulation {{of the right of}} access to justice for individuals facing human rights violations by international organizations. This requires analyzing these notions from a theoretical point of view and assessing the different dispute-settlement mechanisms in order to concretize the right of access to justice for individuals. If no dispute-settlement mechanism has been established by the international organization and if the immunity is not waived by the international organization itself, the question arises whether national courts should be entitled to reject the immunity of international organizations. nrpages: 437 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|For several decades, {{structural}} social psy-chologists {{have been}} developing accounts explaining {{why and how}} patterns of partici-pation and praise emerge among members in interpersonal, task-oriented groups. A major focus {{of this research is}} the role of social characteristics that carry information about one’s status in society, such as gender, educa-tion, occupation, and race. Absent contraven-ing information, individuals in task groups nonconsciously infer expectations of compe-tence from status differences, which create observable inequalities in participation: high-er-status group members contribute more to group discussions, are invited to contribute more, receive superior performance evalua-tions, and are influential (Berger et al. 1977). At the same time, status differentiation acti-vates cultural beliefs that group members “use ” to form reward expectations related to the worthiness of respect. These expectations create observable patterns of deference: higher-status group members receive more respect, esteem, privilege, and importance (Berger et al. 1985). In spite of the behavioral inequalities that arise from the influence of performance and reward expectations, status hierarchies are remarkably stable (Bales and Slater 1955). Rather than vying for praise and par-ticipation time, low-status actors in task groups tend to be obsequious. To account for this fact, Berger and his colleagues have developed a theory that describes the legiti-mation of status hierarchies (Berger et al. 1998; Ridgeway and Berger 1986). The theory highlights “collective validation ” as an important cause of legitimacy; such valida-tion occurs when group members copy or fail to <b>challenge</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> of deference directed toward a high-status actor. This harmony of behavior creates a normative belief in the group, namely that the high-status actor should be treated with deference. Yet the legitimation of status relations via collective validation begs the question “What causes collective validation in the first place?” Through developing our understanding of collective validation, we conduct legitimatio...|$|E
50|$|In France, {{notarial}} instruments, {{whether in}} public (en minute) or private form (en brevet), {{have a high}} degree of authority and are considered probative instruments (acte authentique), received as firsthand and primary evidence in court, and thereby accorded high evidentiary value and executory force, and deemed to be proof of their contents.

5000|$|Although Brandeis's {{concurring opinion}} in Ashwander {{is the primary}} cite for the modern {{formulation}} of the avoidance doctrine, Chief Justice Marshall had cautioned previously that no questions of [...] "greater delicacy" [...] can {{be presented to the}} federal judiciary than those involving <b>a</b> constitutional <b>challenge</b> to <b>a</b> legislative <b>act.</b> He instructed that if such questions [...] "become indispensably necessary to the case," [...] they must be decided, but [...] "if the case may be determined on other points, a just respect for the legislature requires, that the obligation of its laws should not be unnecessarily and wantonly assailed." [...] In Ex parte Randolph, the Chief Justice, while riding circuit, considered <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> to <b>a</b> congressional <b>act</b> which provided that Treasury agents could issue warrants for military officers charged with disbursing public funds who failed to pay and settle their accounts at the Treasury Department. The court concluded that the terms of the act did not apply to an officer temporarily acting as the ship's purser due to the death of the regularly commissioned purser and granted his petition for habeas corpus.Justice Louis D. Brandeis's concurring opinion in Ashwander provides the most significant formulation of the avoidance doctrine, even though the Brandeis formulation had no effect on the outcome of the case because the Justice concurred in the plurality opinion, and the plurality considered and decided the properly presented constitutional issues. In Ashwander, Justice Brandeis identified seven components of the avoidance doctrine.|$|R
40|$|The author {{analyses}} {{the legal}} remedies {{provided by the}} General Administrative Procedure Act of the Republic of Slovenia (GAPA, 1999), as the only legal instrument for the annulment or modification of an issued decision. Particular emphasis {{is given to the}} appeal, often used directly on a constitutional basis. In addition to pursuing the protection of the rights of the parties in administrative proceedings, the purpose of the appeal is to establish an internal administrative supervision of line ministries. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess whether and to what extent certain legal remedies under the GAPA are effective in (Slovenian) practice compared to the goals of their regulation. In order to protect their position, parties should have the possibility of challenging the act both after the issue of the act at first instance as well as after it has become complete or even final and has the force of res iudicata. <b>Challenging</b> <b>an</b> <b>act</b> is possible only through legal remedies provided by law. The modification of decisions after their completeness (after the end of administrative proceedings) or even after finality (following an administrative dispute) is diminishing the level of trust in the legal system (i. e. legal certainty). Therefore the use of, in particular, extraordinary legal remedies have to be limited to the most essential errors in the procedure. Legal remedies are specified primarily by the GAPA, by type as well as by grounds, bodies, effects, characteristics (dispositiveness/officiality, non/suspensiveness, non/devolution, etc.), and time limits. The GAPA distinguishes between the use of legal remedies in connection to completeness of a decision (within the administrative procedure when the decision cannot be challenged (any more) by an appeal) and finality (after the administrative dispute regarding the review of legality of complete decisions is no longer possible). The author is therefore suggesting several amendments to the GAPA to achieve more successfully the goals of present legal remedies and the effectiveness of the administrative system as a whole, including the reduced caseload of the courts when the appeal system is successful in persuading the parties not to continue with the administrative dispute after the completeness of a decision within administrative proceedin g. appeal; effectiveness; administrative system; administrative procedure; legal remedies; legal certainty; legality...|$|R

40|$|Background: WHO {{estimates}} that only 3 % of fever patients use recommended artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), partly reflecting their high {{prices in the}} retail sector from where many patients seek treatment. To overcome this <b>challenge,</b> <b>a</b> global <b>ACT</b> subsidy has been proposed. We tested this proposal through a pilot program in rural Tanzania. Methods/Principal Findings: Three districts were assigned to serve either as a control or to receive the subsidy plus a package of supporting interventions.

2500|$|The {{first rule}} bars collusive suits as not proper cases or controversies under Article III. Brandeis relied on Atherton Mills v.

[...] Mootness, a justiciability doctrine, serves to ensure that a controversy is [...] "live" [...] and in need of judicial resolution. For Brandeis, however, Atherton Mills represented the issue of collusive suits arranged to obtain fast and convenient adjudication of constitutional issues. Brandeis elaborated on this concern in Ashwander, declaring judicial review of the constitutionality of legislative acts legitimate only as a last resort, and as a necessity in the determination of real, earnest and vital controversies between individuals. It was never the thought that a party beaten in the legislature could transfer to the courts, by means of a friendly suit, an inquiry as to the constitutionality of the legislative act.|$|R
