500|$|Donal Skehan {{entered a}} song {{composed}} by Joel Humlen, Oscar Gorres and Charlie Mason, called [...] "Double <b>Cross</b> <b>My</b> Heart". Mason had previously written {{a song for}} pop band Monrose for the German national final in 2007. The song is a pop song, described by Skehan as [...] "Eurovision by numbers". It was performed by Skehan with two male and two female back-up dancers, {{as well as a}} male back-up singer, with Skehan wearing a silver waistcoat and trousers. The performance started with Skehan singing in a spotlight, with the dancers swaying in the background, before coming out and dancing around him.|$|E

[...] May later stated to a USAF {{accident investigation board}} that his [...] "Tally 2" [...] call meant that he saw two helicopters but {{did not mean that}} he was confirming Wickson's identification of them as Hinds. Neither F-15 pilot had been informed that U.S. Army Black Hawks participating in OPC often carried auxiliary fuel tanks mounted on wings nor had either been instructed in the paint scheme that Iraqi Hind helicopters used, light brown and desert tan, which was different from the dark green color used by the Black Hawks. Wickson later stated that, [...] "I had no doubt when I looked at him that he was a Hind[...] [...] [...] The Black Hawk did not even <b>cross</b> <b>my</b> mind." ...|$|E

500|$|When Higginson {{urged her}} to come to Boston in 1868 so that they could {{formally}} meet for the first time, she declined, writing: [...] "Could it please your convenience to come so far as Amherst I should be very glad, but I do not <b>cross</b> <b>my</b> Father's ground to any House or town". It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met. Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and vivid physical account of her on record, as [...] "a little plain woman with two smooth bands of reddish hair ... in a very plain & exquisitely clean white piqué & a blue net worsted shawl." [...] He also felt that he never was [...] "with any one who drained my nerve power so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to live near her." ...|$|E
500|$|Gregg Allman's lyrical {{contributions}} to the band's debut album have been called [...] "remarkably mature lyrical conceptions for such a young man, expertly executed in a minimalist, almost haiku style." [...] Allman's inspiration came from his time in Los Angeles {{as a part of}} Hour Glass, [...] "getting fucked by different land sharks in the business," [...] experiencing great frustration among fierce competition. The traditional blues songs were, likewise, regarded as [...] "songs that were so good they couldn’t be left off the album." [...] On the writing of the record, Allman wrote in his memoir My Cross to Bear, [...] "I wrote most of that whole first record in that one week. I had total peace of mind. L.A. and all its changes didn’t even <b>cross</b> <b>my</b> mind. I felt like I was starting all over, which I was." [...] Most of the songs on the album were written at Rose Hill Cemetery.|$|E

2500|$|While {{recording}} {{her fourth}} album in 1992, Harry collaborated with German post-punk band Die Haut {{on the track}} [...] "Don't <b>Cross</b> <b>My</b> Mind" [...] and released the song [...] "Prelude to a Kiss" [...] on the soundtrack to the film of the same name.

Asked about having allowed the girl to give testimony without identifying herself, and without her story having been corroborated, Lantos replied, [...] "The notion that any of the witnesses brought to the caucus through the Kuwaiti Embassy would not be credible did not <b>cross</b> <b>my</b> mind... I have no basis for assuming that her story is not true, but the point goes beyond that. If one hypothesizes that the woman's story is fictitious from A to Z, that in no way diminishes the avalanche of human rights violations." ...|$|E

[...] During the campaign, Carlson made repeated statements of the form [...] "When she comes on television, I involuntarily <b>cross</b> <b>my</b> legs." [...] Further discussion ensued when the Drudge Report and a few other media outlets ran an unflattering Associated Press photograph of Clinton looking old and tired on the wintry Iowa campaign trail; Limbaugh sympathized with the plight of American women in an appearance-obsessed culture, then asked, [...] "Will this country want to actually watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2004, Gaahl again {{received}} a prison sentence, for aggravated assault. He appealed for a reduced sentence, and in February 2005 he was re-sentenced to fourteen {{months in prison}} and ordered to pay the victim 190,000 NOK (about 30,400 US$) in compensation. The incident happened in February 2002 during a late-night party at Gaahl's house in Espedal, when he became involved in a confrontation {{with a man who}} arrived at his house. Gaahl was accused of severely beating the man, collecting his blood into a cup and threatening to make him drink it. Gaahl said [...] "I {{was the one who was}} attacked, but they think I punished him too hard. As I always say, when people <b>cross</b> <b>my</b> line and I let them know where the line is many steps before they cross it, and still they choose to cross it, then I will be the one to decide what their punishment will be". He also claimed to have given the man the cup [...] "so that he would not make such a mess in my house with all the blood". In March 2006, Gaahl recorded vocals for Gorgoroth's next album, Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam. According to band members, he was in prison from April to December 2006.|$|E
