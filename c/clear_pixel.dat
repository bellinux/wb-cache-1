First, the noisy image is denoised by various wavelet bases and then a set of the denoised images are obtained. Next, the local character is computed in time domain of every denoised image. The variance, the mean and the gradient are selected to explain the local character of the denoised images. When the character is bigger, the recovery effect of the image is better, the pixel is picked up as a <b>clear</b> <b>pixel</b> to the final denoised image. Third, these multiple denoised images are fused into a final denoised image based on the local character.

The CLAVR- 1 (Clouds from AVHRR-Phase I) algorithm classifies 2 3 2 pixel arrays from the Global Area Coverage (GAC) 4 -km-resolution archived database into CLEAR, MIXED, and CLOUDY categories. The algorithm uses {{a sequence of}} multispectral contrast, spectral, and spatial signature threshold tests to perform the classification. The various tests and the derivation of their thresholds are presented. CLAVR- 1 has evolved through experience in applying it to real-time NOAA- 11 data, and retrospectively through the NOAA AVHRR Pathfinder Atmosphere project, where 16 years of data have been reprocessed into cloud, radiation budget, and aerosol climatologies. The classifications are evaluated regionally with image analysis, and it is concluded that the algorithm does well at classifying perfectly <b>clear</b> <b>pixel</b> arrays, except at high latitudes in their winter seasons. It also has difficulties with classi-fications over some desert and mountainous regions and when viewing regions of ocean specular reflection. Generally, the CLAVR- 1 fractional cloud amounts, when computed using a statistically equivalent spatial co-herence method, agree to within about 0. 05 – 0. 10 of image/analyst estimates on average.

At the Goddard Earth Sciences Distributed Active Archive Center (GES DAAC), about 1 TB of new data are archived each day. Distribution to users is also about 1 TB/day. A substantial portion of this distribution is MODIS calibrated radiance data, which has a wide variety of uses. However, much of the data is not useful for a particular user's needs: for example, ocean color users typically need oceanic pixels that are free of cloud and sun-glint. The GES DAAC is using a simple Bayesian classification scheme to rapidly classify each pixel in the scene in order to support several experimental content-based data services for near-real-time MODIS calibrated radiance products (from Direct Readout stations). Content-based subsetting would allow distribution of, say, only <b>clear</b> <b>pixels</b> to the user if desired.

AVHRR day-time imagery is used in order to simulate this radiometer. An algorithm is written making only use of the first two AVHRR channels, and is called the WSD algorithm. IN order to assess the accuracy of its retrieval of the cloud cover, its results are compared to what is called a reference algorithm which on the contrary makes use of all spectral channels, and is based upon the published work of Saunders and Kriebel. The main originality of the first test of the WSD algorithm is the combination of dynamic thresholding of both reflectance and ratio histograms in an iterative fashion. It increases the efficiency of the cloud screening in the following ways: increase the number of clouds detected, decrease the number of actually <b>clear</b> <b>pixels</b> declared as cloudy, make the detection rather insensitive to predefined values. The WSD algorithm is completed by a thresholding on the local variance of the AVHRR 2 reflectance over the ocean. The study shows that cloud screening within a single AVHRR image is possible over Western Europe with visible only. For this area, visible range is more efficient for screening than thermal infra-red. Over the desertic soils of Niger, this is no longer true and both wavelength ranges are required for cloud filtering. This study was funded by Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) ...|$|R

Now, fuzzy logic is widely used in the classification of remotely sensed images, for various land use and land cover classes. Classification of images includes pervious and impervious categories. Pervious categories contain mainly standing water bodies, natural vegetation and agricultural lands. Impervious categories contain dense built-up, moderate built-up and low density built-up area. The images of Ranchi area has been classified using standard maximum likelihood (ML) as well as fuzzy techniques using supervised method of classification using ERDAS IMAGINE 9. 1. After classification of images, producer’s accuracy, user’s accuracy, overall accuracy and kappa coefficient values have been calculated with the help of confusion / error matrix. Result shows that in pervious category, standing water body exhibits highest accuracy (100 %), then natural vegetation and agricultural land exhibits lowest accuracy. Standing water exhibits highest accuracy due to more <b>clear</b> <b>pixels.</b> Among the impervious categories, low density built-up area exhibits highest producer’s accuracy due to small area, dense built-up has second highest and moderate built-up has lowest producer’s accuracies.

Algorithms to derive cloud amount using the brightness temperature differences between infrared channels 3 (3. 7 μm) and 4 (11 μm), 4 and 5 (12 μm) are assessed by comparing to the manual cloud amount and the downward longwave radiation at the ground surface. Cloud amounts obtained from the brightness temperature difference between channels 3 and 4 in summer (month) agree with the manual cloud amounts at the surface (correlation coefficient r≈ 0. 88) and highly correlate to the downward longwave fluxes (r≈ 0. 95). Cloud amounts from channels 4 and 5 show rough agreements with the surface cloud amounts throughout the year. The brightness temperature difference of thick cloud overlaps that of clear area and the temperature dependence of <b>clear</b> <b>pixels</b> accompanies some uncertainties which makes the cloud detection uncertain.

The APOLLO_NG (APOLLO_NextGeneration) {{cloud processing}} scheme is a probabilistic interpretation of the original APOLLO method. It builds upon the physical principles that have served well in the original APOLLO scheme. Nevertheless, a couple of additional variables have been introduced in APOLLO_NG. Cloud detection is no longer performed as a binary yes/no decision based on these physical principles. It is rather expressed as cloud probability for each satellite pixel. Consequently, the outcome of the algorithm can be tuned from being sure to reliably identify <b>clear</b> <b>pixels</b> to conditions of reliably identifying definitely cloudy pixels, depending on the purpose. The probabilistic approach allows retrieving not only the cloud properties (optical depth, effective radius, cloud top temperature and cloud water path) but also their uncertainties. APOLLO_NG is designed as a standalone cloud retrieval method robust enough for operational near-realtime use and for application to large amounts of historical satellite data. The radiative transfer solution is approximated by the same two-stream approach which also had been used for the original APOLLO. This allows the algorithm to be applied {{to a wide range of}} sensors without the necessity of sensorspecific tuning. Moreover it allows for online calculation of the radiative transfer (i. e., within the retrieval algorithm) giving rise to a detailed probabilistic treatment of cloud variables.

The primary public policy imperative of this research was to make reliable prediction of increases in biologically active surface UV radiation due to human activity. By contrast retrieval from satellite data of atmospheric constituents and photo-chemically active radiation that affect air quality is a new and growing field that is presenting us with unique challenges in measurement and data interpretation. A key distinction compared to stratospheric sensors is the greatly enhanced role of clouds, aerosols, and surfaces (CAS) in determining {{the quality and quantity of}} useful data that is available for air quality research. In our presentation we will use data from several sensors that are currently flying on the A-train satellite constellation, including OMI, MODIS, CLOUDSAT, and CALIPSO, to highlight that CAS can have both positive and negative effects on the information content of satellite measurements. This is in sharp contrast to other fields of remote sensing where CAS are usually considered an interference except in those cases when they are the primary subject of study. Our analysis has revealed that in the reflected wavelengths one often sees much further down into the atmosphere, through most cirrus, than one does in the emitted wavelengths. The lower level clouds provide a nice background against which one can track long-range transport of trace gases and aerosols. In addition, differences in trace gas columns estimated over cloudy and adjacent <b>clear</b> <b>pixels</b> can be used to measure boundary layer trace gases. However, in order to take full advantage of these features it will be necessary to greatly advance our understanding of how CAS affect the radiation at wavelengths that are used to derive the atmospheric constituents that affect air quality as well as the radiation that controls the photolysis of chemically active trace gases.

Here, we introduce the Collection 6 (C 6) algorithm to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol size parameters from MODIS-observed spectral reflectance. While {{not a major}} overhaul from the previous Collection 5 (C 5) version, there are enough changes that there is {{significant impact on the}} products and their interpretation. The C 6 algorithm is comprised of three sub-algorithms for retrieving aerosol properties (1) over ocean (dark in visible and near-IR wavelengths), (2) over vegetated/dark-soiled land (dark in the visible) and (3) over desert/arid land (bright in the visible). Here, we focus on the changes to both "dark target" algorithms (# 1 and # 2; DT-ocean and DT-land). Affecting both DT algorithms, we have updated assumptions for central wavelengths, Rayleigh optical depths and gas (H 2 O, O 3 , CO 2 , etc.) absorption corrections, and relaxed the solar zenith angle limit (up to ≤ 84 °) to increase pole-ward coverage. For DT-land, we have updated the cloud mask to allow heavy smoke retrievals, fine-tuned the assignments for aerosol type as function of season/location, corrected bugs in the Quality Assurance (QA) logic, and added diagnostic parameters such topographic altitude. For DT-ocean, improvements include a revised cloud mask for thin-cirrus detection, inclusion of wind speed dependence in the retrieval, updates to logic of QA Confidence flag (QAC) assignment, and additions of important diagnostic information. All together, the changes to the DT algorithms result in reduced global AOD (by 0. 02) over ocean and increased AOD (by 0. 01) over land, along with some changes in spatial coverage. Preliminary validation shows that compared to surface-based sunphotometer data, the C 6 DT-products should compare at least as well as those from C 5. However, {{at the same time as}} we have introduced algorithm changes, we have also been accounting for such "upstream" changes including new instrument calibration, revised land/sea masking and changed cloud masking that has resulted in changes to the coverage and global statistics of the retrieved AOD. To satisfy users' desires for more complete global aerosol coverage, C 6 will include a merged DT/DB product over semi-arid land surfaces. In addition to changes to aerosol retrieval, C 6 will include diagnostic information about clouds in the aerosol field, such as an aerosol "cloud mask" at 500 m resolution, and products that describe the "distance to the nearest cloud" from <b>clear</b> <b>pixels.</b> Finally, responding to the needs of the air quality community, in addition to the standard 10 km product, C 6 will include a global (DT-land and DT-ocean) aerosol product at 3 km resolution...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpectral relationships, {{reflecting}} the spectral dependence of water-leaving reflectance, ρw(λ), {{can be easily}} implemented in current AC algorithms with the aim to improve ρw(λ) retrievals where the algorithms fail. The present study evaluates the potential of spectral relationships to improve the MUMM [Ruddick et al., 2006, Limnol. Oceanogr. 51, 1167 - 1179] and standard NASA [Bailey et al., 2010, Opt. Express 18, 7521 - 7527] near infra-red (NIR) modeling schemes included in the AC algorithm to account for non-zero ρw(λNIR), based on in situ coastal ρw(λ) and simulated Rayleigh corrected reflectance data. Two modified NIR-modeling schemes are investigated: (1) the standard NASA NIR-modeling scheme is forced with bounding relationships in the red spectral domain and with a NIR polynomial relationship and, (2) the constant NIR ρw(λ) ratio used in the MUMM NIR-modeling scheme {{is replaced by a}} NIR polynomial spectral relationship. Results suggest that the standard NASA NIR-modeling scheme performs better for all turbidity ranges and in particular in the blue spectral domain (percentage bias decreased by approximately 50 %) when it is forced with the red and NIR spectral relationships. However, with these new constraints, more reflectance spectra are flagged due to non-physical Chlorophyll-a concentration estimations. The new polynomial-based MUMM NIR-modeling scheme yielded lower ρw(λ) retrieval errors and particularly in extremely turbid waters. However, including the polynomial NIR relationship significantly increased the sensitivity of the algorithm to errors on the selected aerosol model from nearby <b>clear</b> water <b>pixel...</b>|$|R
40|$|Currently two {{algorithms}} {{are being}} used routinely by the MODIS Atmosphere and Ocean Team in order to distinguish sediment influence and <b>clear</b> water <b>pixels</b> over turbid water area. These two algorithms require complicated computational analyses. In this paper, a simple algorithm based on empirical technique to detect the sediment-influenced pixels over coastal waters is proposed {{as an alternative to}} these two algorithms. This study used apparent reflectance acquired from MODIS L 1 B product. This algorithm is based on the gradient difference of the line connecting the 0. 47 - and 1. 24 -qm channels and 0. 47 - and 0. 66 -qm channels of a log-log graph of the apparent reflectance values against MODIS wavelengths. Over clear-water areas (deep blue sea), the 0. 47 -, 0. 66 - and 1. 24 -qm channels fitted very well in line with correlation R > 0. 99. Over turbid waters, a substantial increase of 0. 66 qm in the reflectance leads to a low correlation value. By computing the difference between the gradient of the line connecting 0. 47 and 0. 66 qm and the gradient of the line connecting 0. 47 and 1. 24 qm, the threshold to discriminate turbid and shallow coastal waters from clear-water pixels can be obtained. If the gradient difference is greater than 0, the pixels were then marked as sediment-influenced pixels. This proposed algorithm works well for MODIS Terra and Aqua sensor. The comparison of this algorithm with an established algorithm also showed a good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{retrieval}} algorithms {{are applied}} to Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on both Terra and Aqua, creating two streams of decade-plus aerosol information. Products of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol size are used for many applications, but the primary concern is that these global products are comprehensive and consistent enough for use in climate studies. One of our major customers is the international modeling comparison study known as AEROCOM, which relies on the MODIS data as a benchmark. In order {{to keep up with}} the needs of AEROCOM and other MODIS data users, while utilizing new science and tools, we have improved the algorithms and products. The code, and the associated products, will be known as Collection 6 (C 6). While not a major overhaul from the previous Collection 5 (C 5) version, there are enough changes that there are significant impacts to the products and their interpretation. In its entirety, the C 6 algorithm is comprised of three sub-algorithms for retrieving aerosol properties over different surfaces: These include the dark-target DT algorithms to retrieve over (1) ocean and (2) vegetated-dark-soiled land, plus the (3) Deep Blue (DB) algorithm, originally developed to retrieve over desert-arid land. Focusing on the two DT algorithms, we have updated assumptions for central wavelengths, Rayleigh optical depths and gas (H 2 O, O 3, CO 2, etc.) absorption corrections, while relaxing the solar zenith angle limit (up to 84) to increase pole-ward coverage. For DT-land, we have updated the cloud mask to allow heavy smoke retrievals, fine-tuned the assignments for aerosol type as function of season location, corrected bugs in the Quality Assurance (QA) logic, and added diagnostic parameters such as topographic altitude. For DT-ocean, improvements include a revised cloud mask for thin-cirrus detection, inclusion of wind speed dependence in the retrieval, updates to logic of QA Confidence flag (QAC) assignment, and additions of important diagnostic information. At the same time as we have introduced algorithm changes, we have also accounted for upstream changes including: new instrument calibration, revised land-sea masking, and changed cloud masking. Upstream changes also impact the coverage and global statistics of the retrieved AOD. Although our responsibility is to the DT code and products, we have also added a product that merges DT and DB product over semi-arid land surfaces to provide a more gap-free dataset, primarily for visualization purposes. Preliminary validation shows that compared to surface-based sunphotometer data, the C 6, Level 2 (along swath) DT-products compare at least as well as those from C 5. C 6 will include new diagnostic information about clouds in the aerosol field, including an aerosol cloud mask at 500 m resolution, and calculations of the distance to the nearest cloud from <b>clear</b> <b>pixels.</b> Finally, we have revised the strategy for aggregating and averaging the Level 2 (swath) data to become Level 3 (gridded) data. All together, the changes to the DT algorithms will result in reduced global AOD (by 0. 02) over ocean and increased AOD (by 0. 02) over land, along with changes in spatial coverage. Changes in calibration will have more impact to Terras time series, especially over land. This will result in a significant reduction in artificial differences in the Terra and Aqua datasets, and will stabilize the MODIS data as a target for AEROCOM studi...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [74]- 77) Radiances sensed by radiometers boarded on satellites are {{altered by}} transmitting through the atmosphere. Accurate correction for atmospheric degradation is currently based on modeling the physical behavior o f radiation {{as it passes}} through the atmosphere. An important limitation for the physical model is the requirement for detailed meteorological information pertaining to atmospheric humidity and the concentrations of atmospheric particles. Such data {{may be difficult to}} obtain in the necessary detail and may apply only to a few points during intensive field experiments. Routine application o f such a model is not now practicable. The objective o f this research is to develop (1) a simplified approach for atmospheric corrections for reflectances by using the unique spectral signature of the <b>clear</b> water <b>pixel</b> in satellite images and (2) a simplified method for retrieving land surface temperature from satellite radiances at the thermal bands. Under various clear-sky conditions, a radiative transfer model is used to generate the functional relationships between the atmospheric radiation properties such as scattering coefficient and the radiation caused by the atmosphere above the water body. The parameters, which are used to compute surface radiances, are evaluated with water vapor density and surface air temperature by using the radiative transfer model. Satellite view and solar zenith angles are also considered in developing algorithms. The applications o f the ABSTRACT algorithms to clear days show that the algorithms provide reasonable estimations of reflectances and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values compared with the physically based atmospheric radiative transfer model and a good approximation o f surface temperature compared with observation. Although the algorithms are based on the characteristics o f the spectral bands on the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA- 14) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor, the approaches may by applied to other satellite data.

40|$|Monitoring {{of water}} quality by {{satellite}} ocean colour data requires high quality atmospheric correction {{and especially the}} accurate quantification of the aerosol contribution {{to the top of}} atmosphere radiance. Several methods have been proposed for atmospheric correction over turbid waters, including modelling the marine contributions to the NIR signal or switching to longer short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths where the signal even in turbid waters can be assumed zero. Here we present the use of the high quality SWIR bands of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat- 8, launched in 2013, to extend our existing turbid water atmospheric correction to extremely turbid waters. The atmospheric correction is image based, and no external measurements are required. The aerosol type is estimated using NIR and SWIR bands in <b>clear</b> water <b>pixels,</b> or in all water pixels using the two SWIR bands. The aerosol type is assumed to be constant over a single Landsat- 8 tile (170 by 185 km), or allowed to vary spatially when using both SWIR bands. Realistic spatial patterns of marine reflectances are retrieved, uncorrelated with the estimated aerosol reflectance. Taking spatial and temporal variability into account, products from Landsat- 8 compare well with those of MODIS Aqua and Terra — also using the SWIR bands for atmospheric correction. The limitations of our previously published method (Vanhellemont & Ruddick, 2014 a) are illustrated at higher turbidities, and removed by using the new method. The uncertainty caused by using a single aerosol type per scene is assessed. The advantages of the high spatial resolution L 8 /OLI data are clear for applications in coastal and estuarine waters. As an example of the advantage of high quality SWIR bands, and a SWIR-based atmospheric correction, an algorithm for detecting black suspended sediments from dredging and dumping operations is demonstrated here. In conclusion, L 8 /OLI is a powerful new tool for remote sensing of extremely turbid waters, and {{can be used as a}} precursor for future ocean colour missions with SWIR bands...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSeven of the {{infrared}} channels from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imagery (SEVIRI) instrument, {{on board the}} Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), are used to retrieve Layer Precipitable Water (LPW) and Stability Analysis Imagery (SAI) in the SAFNWC framework. Both products are retrieved using a statistical retrieval based on neural networks; they are routinely generated every fifteen minutes at a satellite horizontal resolution of 3 km in NADIR only in cloud-free areas. Many factors {{are involved in the}} development of severe weather and these parameters are only some of the indicators. However, due to the high resolution of these products, the use of them in conjunction with satellite and radar images can help to identify mesoscale features related to convection. The MSG moisture and parcel instability time trend fields are especially useful during the period previous to convection. Once the outbreak of convection occurs, the products calculated in the <b>clear</b> air <b>pixels</b> surrounding the convective system can give us hints to anticipate its evolution. SAFNWC LPW and SAI were analyzed for a severe weather event during August 2004. A thunderstorm over Teruel (Spain) produced intense precipitation and hail; a tornado developed while this thunderstorm was moving towards SE. The pre-convective parcel potential buoyancy and moisture SAFNWC products changed {{in a way that was}} consistent with the observed intense convective activity. In previous studies, the atmospheric moisture in medium levels, which has been proven to be relevant in some cases, was represented by only one level parameter (ML: middle layer LPW). However, it was observed that this layer is too thick to do an adequate analysis of moisture available for convection. Hence, an improvement on the LPW algorithm has been carried out by splitting the middle layer into two new sub-layers (approximately separated at 700 hPa) and training two new neural networks. The impact of monitoring moisture in the new sub-layers separately in this severe weather event has been tested, and the improvements achieved have been evaluated...|$|R
