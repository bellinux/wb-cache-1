40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the role of}} peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity and resistance indices of both {{the right and left}} inferior thyroid arteries measured by <b>color-flow</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> for a differential diagnosis between gestational transient thyrotoxicosis and Graves' disease during pregnancy. METHODS: The right and left inferior thyroid artery-peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity and resistance indices of 96 patients with thyrotoxicosis (41 with gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, 31 age-matched pregnant patients with Graves' disease and 24 age- and sex-matched non-pregnant patients with Graves' disease) and 25 ageand sex-matched healthy euthyroid subjects were assessed with <b>color-flow</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> RESULTS: The right and left inferior thyroid artery-peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities in patients with gestational transient thyrotoxicosis were found to be significantly lower than those of pregnant patients with Graves' disease and higher than those of healthy euthyroid subjects. However, the right and left inferior thyroid artery peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities in pregnant patients with Graves' disease were significantly lower than those of non-pregnant patients with Graves' disease. The right and left inferior thyroid artery peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities were positively correlated with TSH-receptor antibody levels. We found an overlap between the inferior thyroid artery-blood flow velocities in a considerable number of patients with gestational transient thyrotoxicosis and pregnant patients with Graves' disease. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the measurement of inferior thyroid artery-blood flow velocities with colorflow Doppler ultrasonography does not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be recommended as an initial diagnostic test for a differential diagnosis between gestational transient thyrotoxicosis and Graves' disease during pregnancy...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the primary success and short-term patency {{associated with a}} new 4 -F sheath-compatible self-expanding nitinol stent after failed conventional angioplasty of distal popliteal and infrapopliteal lesions in severe lifestyle-limiting claudication (LLC) and chronic critical limb ischemia (CLI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between May 2003 and July 2005, 35 patients with Rutherford category 3 - 5 disease (16 patients with CLI, 19 patients with LLC) underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stent implantation. Indications for stent placement were residual stenosis, flow-limiting dissections, or elastic recoil after PTA. Before and after the intervention and during the 6 -month follow-up, clinical investigation, <b>color-flow</b> and duplex <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> and digital subtraction angiography were performed. Technical success, primary patency at 6 months, clinical improvement as defined by Rutherford with clinical and hemodynamic measures, and complications were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 22 patients underwent distal popliteal artery stent placement and 13 underwent tibioperoneal artery stent placement. Stent implantation was successfully performed in all patients. After stent placement, the primary cumulative patency rate for the study group at 6 months was 82 %. The mean resting ankle-brachial index at baseline was 0. 50 +/- 0. 16 and significantly increased to 0. 90 +/- 0. 17 at 12 - 24 hours after intervention and 0. 82 +/- 0. 24 at latest follow-up (P <. 001 for both). The sustained clinical improvement rate was 80 % at the 6 -month follow-up. The 6 -month limb salvage rate regarding major amputation was 100 %. The rate of major complications was 17 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{characterize}} thyroid disturbances {{induced by}} interferon-alpha and ribavirin therapy {{in patients with}} chronic hepatitis C. INTRODUCTION: Interferon-alpha is used to treat chronic hepatitis C infections. This compound commonly induces both autoimmune and non-autoimmune thyroiditis. METHODS: We prospectively selected 26 patients with chronic hepatitis C infections. Clinical examinations, hormonal evaluations, and <b>color-flow</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> of the thyroid were performed before and during antiviral therapy. RESULTS: Of the patients in our study, 54 % had no thyroid disorders associated with the interferon-alpha therapy but showed reduced levels of total T 3 along with a decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase. Total T 4 levels were also reduced at 3 and 12 months, but free T 4 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels remained stable. A total of 19 % of the subjects had autoimmune interferon-induced thyroiditis, which is characterized by an emerge of antithyroid antibodies or overt hypothyroidism. Additionally, 16 % had non-autoimmune thyroiditis, which presents as destructive thyroiditis or subclinical hypothyroidism, and 11 % remained {{in a state of}} euthyroidism despite the prior existence of antithyroidal antibodies. Thyrotoxicosis with destructive thyroiditis was diagnosed within three months of therapy, and ultrasonography of these patients revealed thyroid shrinkage and discordant change in the vascular patterns. DISCUSSION: Decreases in the total T 3 and total T 4 levels may be related to improvements in the hepatocellular lesions or inflammatory changes similar to those associated with nonthyroidal illnesses. The immune mechanisms and direct effects of interferon-alpha can be associated with thyroiditis. CONCLUSION: Interferon-alpha and ribavirin induce autoimmune and non-autoimmune thyroiditis and hormonal changes (such as decreased total T 3 and total T 4 levels), which occur despite stable free T 4 and TSH levels. A thyroid hormonal evaluation, including the analysis of the free T 4, TSH, and antithyroid antibody levels, should be mandatory before therapy, and an early re-evaluation within three months of treatment is necessary as an appropriate follow-up.

OBJETIVOS: Identificar probabilidade de diferentes padrões de refluxo nas veias safenas de mulheres com vários graus de insuficiência venosa crônica e avaliar se o comprometimento das junções das safenas está associado com gravidade da insuficiência venosa. MÉTODOS: Um total de 1. 184 membros inferiores de 672 mulheres foram estudados pela ultra-sonografia {{vascular}} com Doppler colorido e avaliados pela classificação clínica, etiológica, anatômica e patológica (CEAP). As extremidades foram agrupadas de acordo com a gravidade da insuficiência venosa em graus leve (CEAP C 1 -C 2), moderado (CEAP C 3) e grave (CEAP C 4 -C 6). Para avaliar a classificação clínica CEAP na predição do padrão de refluxo, utilizou-se o Teorema de Bayers.

Studies demonstrated {{that in most}} patients with chronic venous insufficiency junctions are competent and reflux is present in segments {{in the course of}} saphenous veins. OBJECTIVES: To identify the probability of different reflux patterns in the saphenous veins of women with various degrees of chronic venous insufficiency and to evaluate whether junction impairment is associated with severity of venous insufficiency. METHODS: A total of 1, 184 lower limbs of 672 women were evaluated by <b>color-flow</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and classified according to clinical, etiologic, anatomic and pathophysiological classification (CEAP). The extremities were divided according to severity of venous insufficiency into three groups: mild (CEAP C 1 -C 2), moderate (CEAP C 3) and severe (CEAP C 4 -C 6). Bayes' theorem was used to evaluate CEAP classification as a predictor of reflux patterns. The association between CEAP clinical classification and reflux patterns with or without saphenofemoral and saphenopopliteal insufficiency was analyzed using chi-square test (p < 0. 05). RESULTS: Out of 1, 184 lower limbs, 50. 2 % had varicose veins without edema (CEAP C 2). The most common reflux pattern was the segmental in both great (35. 14 %) and small (8 %) saphenous vein, regardless of severity of venous insufficiency. Saphenofemoral and saphenopopliteal junctions were the source of reflux in 12 and 6 % of lower limbs, respectively. Considering the association between CEAP clinical class and saphenous vein insufficiency, there was significant difference between presence of reflux in saphenofemoral (p = 0. 0009) and saphenopopliteal (p = 0. 0006) junctions in advanced disease.

In addition, we determine the hemodynamic parameters by spectral analysis obtained during a Color <b>Doppler</b> <b>Ultrasonography</b> procedure. We have studied the usefulness of Color <b>Doppler</b> <b>Ultrasonography</b> in mapping oral squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa, tongue and lip. Methods: This case-control study enrolled 60 subjects aged 20 - 70 years. Group A constituted 30 cases diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma and Group B constituted 30 healthy controls. Ultrasonographic investigation of each mass was performed. The spectral waveform (time-velocity Doppler spectrum) of the flow signal was analyzed for the pulsatility index, resistive index, peak systolic velocity (m/sec), and end diastolic velocity (m/sec). All patients had real-time, gray-scale sonography and Color <b>Doppler</b> <b>Ultrasonography</b> with spectral wave analysis. Results: The mean value for the resistive index in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma was 0. 40 ± 0. 14 whereas for healthy subjects, it was 0. 83 ± 0. 07.

OBJECTIVE: To determine validity indices for <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and to correlate them with CTA results in a group of patients who had undergone elective endovascular treatment of AAAs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients were selected.

Velocity contour plots from computer simulations before and after flow diversion closely resembled the patterns obtained by color <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> Conclusion: The CFD estimation of flow reduction in aneurysms treated with a flow-diverting stent was verified by <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in patient-specific phantom models of bifurcation and side-wall aneurysms. The combination of CFD and ultrasonography may constitute a feasible and reliable technique in studying the treatment of intracranial aneurysms with flow-diverting stents...|$|R
40|$|A 53 -year-old {{male with}} {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. Preoperative computed tomography revealed main portal vein luminal narrowing by flat thrombi {{and the development}} of cavernous transformation. On post-transplantation day 1, thrombotic portal venous occlusion occurred, and emergency thrombectomy was performed. Subsequent <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography confirmed the restoration of normal portal venous flow. The next day, however, decreased portal venous velocity was observed via <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> and serum liver enzymes and bilirubin levels remained persistently elevated. Direct portography identified massive perfusion steal through prominent splenorenal collateral veins. Stent insertion and balloon angioplasty of the portal vein were performed, and subsequent <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> demonstrated normalized portal flow parameters. Afterwards, the serum liver enzymes and bilirubin levels rapidly normalized...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: One {{principal}} {{mechanism of}} photodynamic therapy (PDT) in tumors is destruction of tumor-associated vasculature. In the present study, the vascular effects of PDT in tumors were investigated with power <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in cats were treated. Tumors were examined via power <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> before, 5 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours after PDT. Images were digitized for computer-aided assessment of vascularity and blood volume. RESULTS: Mean baseline tumor vascularity and blood volume were moderate. During PDT, {{a significant decrease}} in vascularity and blood volume was noted. Lowest values were found 24 hours after PDT. CONCLUSIONS: Power <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> represents a non-invasive modality to successfully monitor the vascular effects and thus, treatment efficacy, of PDT...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. It {{is highly}} {{appreciated}} to provide exact data on vascular invasion of pancreatic carcinoma relying {{as much as}} possible on non-invasive diagnostic procedures. Color <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> has been proven as an efficient method for clinical staging of pancreatic carcinoma essential for therapeutic decisions. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide an analysis of the sensitivity and specificity for color <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in patients suffering from pancreatic carcinoma. Methods. We performed color <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> examination in 43 patients with pancreatic carcinoma prior to the surgery. The findings of ultrasonography on neoplasm vascular invasion were correlated to the findings obtained during the subsequent surgical procedures. An estimation of neoplastic invasion of certain blood vessels including portal vein, celiac trunk, and superior mesenteric artery and vein is critical for decision making regarding surgical treatment. The patients with metastases of pancreatic carcinoma were excluded from the study. Results. Comparing color Doppler and the surgical findings we estimated the sensitivity for detection of neoplastic vascular invasion ranging from 79 − 93 %, whereas the specificity range was from 83 − 93 %. Conclusion. Color <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is a sufficiently sensitive and specific method for evaluation of vascular invasion in pancreatic carcinoma patients. Since color <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is a non-invasive, radiation free, and inexpensive diagnostic tool, considering also the results of this and similar studies we could strongly recommend its use for an initial presurgical evaluation of vascular invasion in pancreatic carcinoma patients...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to compare specifi city and sensitivity of Color <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> with CT angiography. Methods: A total of one hundred patients suffering from carotid artery disease (n= 200) were tested in {{this research}} in the period from June till October, 2011. Average age of the patients was 61. 5 years, and most of the patients were in the age group ranging from 55 to 65 years. The level of carotid artery stenosis is measured according to Standards of the North America Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trail study,by method of Color <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and CT angiography. Results: Stenosis < 50 % registered by <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was found in 62 % and by CT angiography in 64 % patients. Stenosis from 70 to 79 % registered by <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was found in 88 % and by CT angiography in 82 % patients. In patients with level of stenosis 70 - 79 % there was a tendency of registering the stenosis to be higher by Color <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography,</b> than by CT angiography. In the case of the occlusion, there was also the similar observation, with variation of 8 % carotid arteries. Conclusion: Extracranial Doppler and color duplex ultrasound enable reliable detection of both stenosis and occlusion of carotid arteries and accordingly they occupy an important place in radiological algorithm. When it comes to CT angiography it can be concluded that it can provide accurate and exact information regarding the condition of blood vessels as good as Digital Subtractive Angiography can. </p...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundEarly and {{accurate}} diagnosis of post-surgical {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) can be difficult and time-consuming, even with duplex <b>ultrasonography.</b> Portable continuous-wave <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> {{may be useful in}} screening patients for postoperative DVT. Further confirmation of Doppler-positive cases by duplex ultrasound might then be more cost-effective. MethodsAll major post-surgical patients from the departments of general surgery, orthopaedic surgery and colorectal surgery were screened on the third postoperative day for DVT by assessing the quality of the flow signal (“whoosh”) obtained by placing the probe over the femoral vein and subsequently over the popliteal vein, both with a distal squeeze, as well as assessment of phasic flow with respiration. An absent or attenuated “whoosh” was judged to be suspicious for DVT and required formal duplex ultrasonography. The first 800 consecutive patients were studied to determine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of portable <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> for DVT screening. ResultsTwenty-four cases of DVT were diagnosed, comprising seven cases in the proximal veins and 17 cases in the calf veins. The sensitivity of <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> was 12. 5 % and the specificity was 96. 8 %. The positive and negative predictive values were 10. 7 % and 97. 3 %, respectively. ConclusionsPortable <b>Doppler</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> does not have adequate accuracy {{to be used as a}} quick screening tool for DVT...|$|R
