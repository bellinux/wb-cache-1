2500|$|The precise figure Germany paid is {{a matter}} of dispute. The German Government {{estimated}} it had paid the equivalent of 67.8 billion gold marks in reparations. The German figure includedother than gold or goods in kindthe scuttling of the interned German fleet at Scapa Flow, state property lost in lands ceded to other countries, and the loss of colonial territories. The Reparation Commission and the Bank for International Settlements state that [...] gold marks was paid by Germany in reparations, of which [...] was paid before the implementation of the London Schedule of Payments. Niall Ferguson provides a slightly lower figure. He estimates that Germany paid no more than [...] gold marks. Ferguson further estimates that this sum amounted to 2.4 per cent of Germany's national income between 1919 and 1932. Stephen Schuker, in his definitive econometric study (1988, pp.106–19), concedes that Germany transferred 16.8 billion marks over the whole period, but points out that this sum was vastly offset by the devaluation of Allied paper-mark deposits up to 1923, and by loans that Germany subsequently repudiated after 1924. [...] The net <b>capital</b> <b>transfer</b> into Germany amounted to 17.75 billion marks, or 2.1% of Germany's entire national income over the period 1919–1931. In effect, therefore, America paid reparations to Germany—four times more, in price-adjusted terms, than the U.S. furnished to West Germany under the post-1948 Marshall Plan. According to Gerhard Weinberg, reparations were paid, towns were rebuilt, orchards replanted, mines reopened and pensions paid. However, the burden of repairs was shifted away from the German economy and onto the damaged economies of the war's victors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple model of elite formation emanating from a colonisers quest to maximise extracted output from its colonies. Under alternative speci 8 ̆ 5 ca-tions {{of the production}} function, {{the results of the}} model suggests multiple equilibria associated with varying combinations of elite dimension and human <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> that maximise the colonisers objective function, depending on both the technology of governance chosen by the coloniser, {{as well as on the}} parameterisation of the pro-ductivity distance between elites and the population masses and on the returns to human capital. Under an additively separable production function, these equilibria range from (1) high human <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> to a fairly large elite under a gover-nance technology by numbers, to (2) either high or low human <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> to a fairly large elite under a governance technology by quality, to (3) high human <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> to a relatively small elite or low human <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> to either a fairly small or large elite under a composite governance technology.

Large foreign <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> permit over-valued ex-change rates to develop or continue, and these penalize agriculture by reducing the incentives to export and by increasing the incen-tives to import. Results indicate that an increasing ratio of foreign debt to GNP is associated with an increasing ratio of agri-cultural imports to GNP and a decreasing ratio of agricultural exports to GNP. It is concluded that further borrowing by debt-burdened countries is unlikely to solve their basic problems unless accompanied by the appropriate economic policy changes necessary for long-term economic growth...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the pattern of decolonisation in West Africa was a {{function}} of the nature of human <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> from the colonisers to the indigenous elites of the former colonies. Underpinning the nature of these human <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> is the colonial educational ideology. Where this ideology emphasized the notion of "assimilation", the system generally tended to produce elites that depended highly on the coloniser for their livelihood, hence necessitating a continuation of the imperial relationship even after independence was granted. On the contrary, where the ideology emphasized the "strengthening of the solid elements" of the country-side, the system tended to produce a bunch of elites that were quite independent of the coloniser and consequently had little to lose from a disruption of the imperial relationship at independence. The model raises several predictions based on a single assumption {{on the nature of the}} nationalist elite. The paper's contribution, is in providing a framework for understanding the different paths of decolonisation in Africa in general, but more specifically in the British and French West African empires, an approach which unites both the Eurocentric and Afrocentric perspectives.

40|$|The project Socio-economic {{aspects of}} the {{greenhouse}} effect: Climate fund studies the impact of international <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> on the efficiency and efficacy of greenhouse gas emission reduction. The absolute costs of emission abatement is substantially lower in less developed countries. The associated reduction of the damage due to conventional air pollution is higher in the richer countries in both absolute and relative terms. The costs of climatic change are relatively higher (but absolute lower) in the developing countries. Prime impacts are on agriculture (in the developing world) and human health (highly valued in the developed world). Costs of emission reduction and climatic change are joined in a nine region, quasi-Ramsey, integrated climate-economy model, called FUND, The first calculations with this model show that the (hardly known) dynamics of climate change and the great uncertainties play a critical role, that free riding behaviour need not be as prominent a problem as is generally believed, and that international <b>capital</b> <b>transfers</b> {{do not seem to}} substantially influence the optimal emission control, as the regions most interested in climate change do not have much <b>capital</b> to <b>transfer.</b> Negotiated emission caps are likely to alter this conclusion...|$|R
