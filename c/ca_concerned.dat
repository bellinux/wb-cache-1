40|$|Background When a {{diagnosis}} of congenital anomaly (CA) is made, parents are confronted with new and complex medical information, which may impact their parental adjustment.

Objective/hypothesis This study aimed to characterize both parents' perceptions of information <b>concerning</b> the <b>CA</b> and to investigate their role in maternal and paternal adjustment, {{one month after the}} disclosure and six months post-birth. Methods Thirty six couples whose infants were prenatally- or postnatally diagnosed with a CA participated in this prospective longitudinal study. During both assessment times (Time 1 : one-month after the disclosure; Time 2 : six-month post-birth), they answered the Brief Symptom Inventory- 18, the EUROHIS-QOL- 8, and other specific questions to assess parents' information perceptions. Results Mothers were more satisfied than fathers (p <. 01) with the amount of information that was received at the disclosure, although mothers and fathers reported similar levels of comprehension of information. Six-month post-birth, both parents were similarly satisfied with the information that was received, although mothers sought significantly more (p <. 01) additional information. Both maternal and paternal adjustment were significantly associated with maternal perceptions of information <b>concerning</b> <b>CA.</b> Conclusion Health professionals should recognize the important role of information <b>concerning</b> <b>CA</b> in parental adjustment and tailor their communication practices in order to promote parents' satisfaction and comprehension of the medical information.

40|$|Anorexia nervosa (AN) is {{a chronic}} and complex {{psychosomatic}} condition, characterised by a primary drive {{to be thin}} and a refusal to maintain normal body weight. Only a minority of people diagnosed with AN ever become asymptomatic and more research has been called for to address high drop-out rates and lack of engagement in AN treatment services, in particular psychotherapeutic treatment. Prior studies have generally examined this problem in terms of patient mediated variables, such as attitudes and behaviours, with little focus on contextual factors. Research that has studied therapeutic engagement {{in the area of}} AN has yet to examine psychotherapeutic treatments-in-practice. Guided by this gap in the literature this thesis examines ways in which therapists engage with adolescents diagnosed with AN in naturally occurring psychotherapeutic interactions. A secondary and concurrent focus is to look at how the therapists’ underlying theoretical models are reflected in in situ practice. The data corpus comprises twenty-four therapy sessions recorded in an eating disorders programme based in a children’s hospital. In contrast to eating disorders treatment statistics reported in the literature, the programme has a low drop-out rate, zero mortality rate and good long-term patient outcomes, making it an especially suitable setting to examine engagement. Drawing on methods from discursive psychology (DP) and conversation analysis (CA), a number of interactional practices are found which show how the key principles of engagement and neutrality are brought off, or achieved as such in turn-by-turn interaction. Central to the analysis, is the recurrent production of patients’ bodily states and conduct as delicate items. As these topics are also the primary focus of the institutional setting, the analysis shows how practices such as perspective display series and dispositional management allow delicately marked institutional tasks to be carried out. The analysis also examines how patients’ bodies and conduct are embedded in, and constituted as problematic in the interactions. Regularities, such as agentic repositioning in accounts, demonstrate the co-production of patients as psychologically compliant with treatment while physically non-compliant. This thesis contributes to work in applied <b>CA</b> <b>concerning</b> links between theoretical models and interactional practices by demonstrating naturally occurring regularities that describe key guiding principles of the eating disorders programme. It also builds on work in DP concerning examinations of the body and embodiment, by showing how patients’ physical bodies are an integrated feature of the interactions. Finally, this thesis has implications for a clinical audience in terms of extending therapists’ awareness of how engagement with patients is constituted interactionally, which also contributes to wider AN literature on ‘resistance’ to therapy...|$|R

Research on cellular automata (<b>CA)</b> is <b>concerned</b> with the question how global behaviours arise from local updating rules relating a cell to its direct neighbours.

Considering a particular local updating rule, we encode this problem into PDDL and show that the resulting benchmark is an interesting challenge for AI Planning. For example, our experiments determine that, very atypically, an optimal SAT-based planner outperforms state-of-the-art satisficing heuristic search planners. This points to a severe weakness of current heuristics because, as we prove herein, plans for this problem can always be constructed in time linear {{in the size of the}} automaton.

These 3 compounds showed negative inotropic effects (NIE) and negative chronotropic effects (NCE) at a final concentration of 10 － 5 or 10 － 4 M in an experiment using right atrial specimens.

Therefore, effective alternative therapies are necessary for treating women with puerperal mood and anxiety disorders.
