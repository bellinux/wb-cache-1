50|$|Manifolds {{intended}} for use with sets where a regulator is provided for each cylinder {{are connected to the}} cylinder valves upstream of the cylinder valve seat, to a connecting port provided specifically for this purpose. Two styles of connection are available for this arrangement - face seal, and barrel seal. Face seal connections are similar to the DIN regulator connection seal, and consist of an o-ring in a groove machined into the end of the manifold tube, which is clamped against the face of the valve port by a threaded component. Face seals are simple and rugged, but rely on tight connection for a reliable seal, and do not allow any adjustment for cylinder <b>centre</b> <b>distance.</b> Barrel seals use one or two O-rings in grooves around the end of the manifold tube, which seal against the bore of the valve port. They are usually screwed into the valve port with handed thread, and locked with a lock-nut. They are generally slightly less rugged than face seal manifolds, and more vulnerable to thread damage during assembly, but allow a small amount of cylinder <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> adjustment, and provide a reliable seal even if not completely tight. Manifolds of this type are commonly supplied in sets comprising a manifold and compatible left and right side cylinder valves with a choice of neck thread specification. The working components for all three valves in the set are usually identical.|$|E
50|$|In {{this case}} {{generally}} forward reverse synchronizers {{are replaced by}} the multi-plate friction clutches. Typically the multi-plate clutches are arranged on the main shaft or on the counter shaft. The forward reverse section of the gear box is generally located in the forward section {{as close to the}} engine as possible. This is beneficial to the forward reverse control elements as they are not subjected to the high relative torque.The challenge involved in providing this feature in the existing transmissions is the complex shaft arrangement. This problem arises due to the limitation of <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> between the two shafts and fixed axial dimensions due to the vehicle size limitations.|$|E

50|$|Barrel sealed {{manifolds}} {{with two}} O-rings in parallel are {{more tolerant of}} minor misalignment and varied <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> than face-sealed manifolds with single O-ring seals which {{are more likely to}} leak if impacted. Isolation manifolds provide the possibility of closing off one cylinder if there is an unrecoverable leak, conserving the remaining gas in the other cylinder. Cylinder or manifold valve knob extension operators (slobwinders) can be stiff, can trail and snag on things, and can be difficult to find when needed. Valve- and manifold protector frames are not necessary and may be worse line-traps than the valves. Some models {{make it more difficult to}} reach the valve, and some can increase the diver's profile.|$|E

40|$|Overcut means tip {{interference}} of a pinion and {{an internal}} gear outside {{the line of}} action. Until 1969, the phenomenon was described by an involute theory with fixed <b>centre</b> <b>distance,</b> either kinematically [1. [...] 6] or geometrically [8]. The cutting process was neglected or confused with radial assembly. Inspired by a partly correct comment in [4], the mystery of tip interference [9] was solved by a study of interference at changing <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> [10, 11]. Now, the theory includes the cutting process when the cutter moves in an arbitrary direction (oblique retraction). A reference <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> defines a cycloidal tip curve, whilst a conjugate <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> defines the generated involute that recovers the excavation of the reference cycloid. The conjugation of centre distances provides an effective mathematical tool, which is developed into easy computation procedures...|$|E

40|$|Quietness and reliability, {{together}} with efficiency and lightweight design, are key requirements {{to compete in}} current mechanical industry. Within the latter, gearboxes {{play an important role}} as the usual choice to transmit mechanical power with high energy density, especially when using cylindrical involute gears. Noise and vibration performance are strongly influenced by tooth microgeometry modifications. Typical modifications are applied along the profile and the lead of the teeth. Profile modifications mainly compensate for tooth deflections; lead modifications mainly compensate for angular misalignments. Both modification types yield optimal performance at a given operating condition (e. g. nominal transmitted torque under ideal alignment), minimizing the meshing excitation. One key operating condition for the gear pair is represented by the instantaneous <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> between the gears. <b>Centre</b> <b>distance</b> variations affect mainly the pressure angle for the transmitted contact force, the total contact ratio and the active tooth height. Furthermore after a change in <b>centre</b> <b>distance,</b> the contacting surfaces on the tooth flanks shift with respect to each other; this yields a mismatch with respect to the theoretical start for the tooth profile modifications. A precision gear test rig, where operating conditions can be varied and tightly controlled, is used in this paper to evaluate the effects of <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> variations on the dynamic behaviour of a spur gear pair. The dynamic behaviour is characterized relying on the so-called Static Transmission Error (STE). Spectral analysis of the STE provides an indication of the internal excitation generated by gear meshing. Results show that the STE is sensitive to small changes in <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> (in the order of 0. 1 % of the nominal value). In particular, it is also observed that the transmitted torque for obtaining minimum STE peak to peak value changes significantly {{as a function of the}} <b>centre</b> <b>distance.</b> status: submitte...|$|E

40|$|For {{over forty}} years {{internal}} gears {{were surrounded by}} obscurity occasioned by the discovery of tip interference where calculation suggested {{that it would not}} occur (I) +. The present author developed a new theory for tip interference which gave better insight in the manufacturing process. Internal gears not satisfying rule (12) will be injured by the cutter at a <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> still too low for involute geherating. This injuring phenomenon in an early stage of cutting is. called overcut. The overcut has to be neutralized by an increase of, the tooth spaces to such an amount that the final generating <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> is larger than existing theories suggested. When rule (12) is satisfied, then there is no overcut and no tip interference...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the spatial {{variation}} in household greenhouse emissions from local transportation in Trondheim, the reasons for this variation, and explore scenarios of what bearing these variations might have on greenhouse gas emissions in the future. Data from a national travel survey was used together with modal emissions coefficients to model the average emissions per capita for 46 geographic zones in Trondheim. Linear regression was used to explain the variation in average emissions using a number of explanatory variables identified from the literature. The regression models explained around 75 &# 150; 80 per cent of the spatial variation in average emissions (0. 75 &# 8804; adj r 2 &# 8804; 0. 79), with <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> explaining the majority of variation. Using a regression function containing <b>centre</b> <b>distance</b> and access to public transport as explanatory variables, five scenarios were constructed for emissions in 2030, which suggest that centralisation of new residential building developments and improvement in the public transport network could limit the growth in annual greenhouse gas emissions to approximately 10 per cent in the presence of approximately 30 per cent population growth. </p...|$|E
