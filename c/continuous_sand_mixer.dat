40|$|Investigations of {{operating}} parameters of widely used <b>sand</b> <b>mixers</b> reveal a wide variability {{range in the}} values of parameters associated with their power demand. Power efficiency of manufacturing processes has received {{a great deal of}} attention lately, which encourages the research efforts to optimise this aspects of operation of machines and installations as well. In the first place these machines and installations have to work properly as a part of the process line- which applies also to moulding <b>sand</b> <b>mixers.</b> Experiments conducted by the authors suggest that the same goal can be achieved at variable energy input levels. To obtain information about the power demands of <b>sand</b> <b>mixers</b> requires the use of highly specialised equipment, methodology and result processing procedures.

30|$|The {{occurrence}} of tsunami deposits only in specific areas {{is in contrast}} to onshore tsunami deposits, which commonly form a <b>continuous</b> <b>sand</b> layer covering the inundation zone directly following flooding by the tsunami (Shiki et al., 2008). Although offshore tsunami deposits were speculated to be more common than onshore deposits (Dawson and Stewart, 2007), their actual deposition and subsequent preservation depends strongly on the local geomorpholog-ical configurations of the shelf and nearshore area and onshore conditions. It is proposed that in coastal environments similar to our study area, a higher amount of tsunamigenic material is deposited and subsequently preserved onshore than offshore.|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} filter {{is a kind}} of sand filter, {{which will}} operate without any interruptions for backwashing and also it accepts high-suspended solid levels in feed stream. Fouled sand is continuously removed from the filter bed, washed and recycled back without interruption with filtration process. Various samples of water with certain amounts of turbidity enter through a feed pipe and being distributed to the filter. A central column runs from top to bottom of the filter. The water is led through an outer tube in the column by a set of radial, distributor arms. The polluted water flows up ward through the sand bed. The water emerges; clean, in the top section of the tank, and eventually spills over a weir, and then inters into a discharge pipe. In this research, the <b>continuous</b> <b>sand</b> filter was studied to determine its disinfection efficiency in addition to turbidity removal. The results showed that the filtered water had a high quality and the turbidity reduction was 95. 5 %. Inspecting the work of the filter had revealed that the removal rates of coliforms and microbial colonies were 99. 67 % and 98. 99 % respectively. On the other hand, by the use of direct filtration, turbidity reduction was over 97 %. In direct filtration, drinking water with less than 1 NTU turbidity was provided.

A finishing machine known as a multi disc sander or buffer is then used for the final sanding steps.|$|R
30|$|Sedimentary {{deposits}} {{from the}} tsunami {{are found in}} most places where the tsunami flooding occurred and covered almost the entire inundation zone. Most deposits are {{in the form of}} <b>continuous</b> <b>sand</b> sheets or patches. Only in a very few places are boulders transported and left by the tsunami (e.g., Pakarang Cape). The tsunami deposits are usually missing in a belt 10 to 250 m wide next to the shoreline (Figs. 3 and 4) where erosion and/or sediment bypassing dominated. In some cases, no tsunami deposits are found close to the flooding limit. However, in places where the tsunami flooding was limited by a cliff or scarp, they tend to be relatively thick (e.g., transect 2 in Fig. 3).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{description}} is given of a distinctive marine deposit at Boca do Rio on the Algarve coast of Portugal. It is proposed {{here that the}} sediment accumulation was deposited by the tsunami generated by the Lisbon earthquake of 1 November, AD 1755. The deposit exhibits sedimentary characteristics quite unlike other coastal sediment accumulations that are deposited by more moderate wave r&eacute;gimes. These include laterally <b>continuous</b> <b>sand</b> layers, chaotic pebble horizons, large amounts of gravel-sized shell debris and distinctive assemblages of marine microfossils. A preliminary attempt is made here to use the empirical field and laboratory data to define more clearly the processes of coastal sedimentation that characterize tsunami runup.

5000|$|There {{was not one}} {{bottleneck}} to faster casting production {{but rather}} several. Improvements were made in molding speed, molding sand preparation, sand mixing, core manufacturing processes, and the slow metal melting rate in cupola furnaces. In 1912, the sand slinger was invented by the American company Beardsley & Piper. In 1912, the first <b>sand</b> <b>mixer</b> with individually mounted revolving plows was marketed by the Simpson Company. In 1915, the first experiments started with bentonite clay instead of simple fire clay as the bonding additive to the molding sand. This increased tremendously the green and dry strength of the molds. In 1918, the first fully automated foundry for fabricating hand grenades for the U.S. Army went into production. In the 1930s the first high-frequency coreless electric furnace was installed in the U.S. In 1943, ductile iron was invented by adding magnesium to the widely used grey iron. In 1940, thermal sand reclamation was applied for molding and core sands. In 1952, the [...] "D-process" [...] was developed for making shell molds with fine, pre-coated sand. In 1953, the hotbox core sand {{process in which the}} cores are thermally cured was invented. In 1954, a new core binder—water glass (sodium silicate), hardened with CO2 from ambient air, came into use.|$|R

The sand wall, which varied in height from 20 - 25 m, was inclined at an angle of 45-65 degrees. The sand wall and its concrete support prevented any armored or amphibious units from landing on the east bank of the Suez Canal without prior engineering preparations. Israeli planners estimated it would take at least 24 hours, probably a full 48 hours for the Egyptians to breach the sand wall and establish a bridge across the canal.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} for leachate movement {{out of a}} sanitary landfill was evaluated and simulated by a computer program model. Landfill operations and geohydrological conditions in the area were investigated {{in order to develop}} a conceptual model of the system and to obtain numerical data {{for the development of the}} simulation. The landfill is operated in a 20 to 27 foot thick clay till which overlies a 10 foot thick, <b>continuous</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel aquifer. Monitor wells located around the site indicate minimal changes in groundwater quality to this date. This is attributed to the slow movement of leachate through the confining layer which would take at least 5 to 10 years. Numerical parameters not readily determined were varied in 16 simulations. This procedure allowed analysis of the different plumes developed as well as observation of the program’s sensitivity to such changes. In simulations of five years from the time leachate would enter the aquifer, leachate plumes were developed which extended a mile and one half down the hydrologic gradient from the landfill. Varying the parameters led to fairly consistant conclusions regarding the effects of the landfill. Ball State UniversityMuncie, IN 47306 Thesis (M. S.) [...] Ball State University...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{recurrence}} of drought in western Iowa, water users have increasingly {{been looking for}} additional sources of water. Buried sand and gravel aquifers associated with three bedrock channels were investigated as potential sources. Due to low data density, two primary study areas were chosen {{for a more detailed}} analysis. Point coverage was not sufficient to generate isopach maps or perform statistical analysis, but the production of cross-sections aided in the understanding of the sand and gravel bodies. Valley fills, where present, are likely to be laterally continuous, but not all valleys will have a significant thickness of sand and gravel. Sand sheets also have the potential to be laterally continuous, but their margins will not be as predictable as a valley fill since they are not bounded by a valley wall. This study demonstrates the complexity of glacial till sequences and predicting the presence of sand and gravel bodies within or between till sheets. On a local (community or township) scale, it appears that general trends can be established if the data density is sufficient. However, there is less confidence in using this data as a predictive tool on a regional scale. Several areas, such as the Glenwood Chute, have thick and <b>continuous</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel bodies. In many other areas, the data is not sufficient to map the sand and gravel. In many cases, one or two highly productive wells are identified, but their lateral distribution cannot be established. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The {{near-field}} {{expression of}} the tsunami produced by the 15 November 2006 Kuril earthquake (Mw 8. 1 – 8. 4) in the middle Kuril Islands, Russia, including runup of up to 20 m, remained unknown until we conducted a post-tsunami survey {{in the summer of}} 2007. Because the earthquake occurred between summer field expeditions in 2006 and 2007, we have observations, topographic profiles, and photographs from three months before and nine months after the tsunami. We thoroughly surveyed portions of the islands of Simushir and Matua, and also did surveys on parts of Ketoi, Yankicha, Ryponkicha, and Rasshua. Tsunami runup in the near-field of the middle Kuril Islands, over a distance of about 200 km, averaged 10 m over 130 locations surveyed and was typically between 5 and 15 m. Local topography strongly affected inundation and somewhat affected runup. Higher runup generally occurred along steep, protruding headlands, whereas longer inundation distances occurred on lower, flatter coastal plains. Sediment transport was ubiquitous where sediment was available—deposit grain size was typically sand, but ranged from mud to large boulders. Wherever there were sandy beaches, a more or less <b>continuous</b> <b>sand</b> sheet was present on the coastal plain. Erosion was extensive, often more extensive than deposition in both space and volume, especially in areas with runup of more than 10 m. The tsunami eroded the beach landward, stripped vegetation, created scours and trim lines, cut through ridges, and plucked rocks out of the coastal plain.

30|$|Based on the {{geophysical}} borehole data, {{the rock}} types, accurate thickness of each rock units, aquifer thickness, depths to different rock types, and {{properties of the}} aquifer, water contents can be precisely determined (Figs.  3, 4, 5). This demonstrates that geophysical borehole logs can provide information on the essential factors needed for a well design. Two major freshwater aquifers have been distinguished in the Coastal Apapa Area: shallow aquifers, which are prone to surface contamination and overlies saltwater-bearing sediments, and deep confined aquifer, which are encountered at depths below 150 – 160  m (depending on the area) and directly underlies saltwater-bearing sediments. The second deep freshwater aquifer occurs at different depths with interbedded clay intervals. For a good borehole design and water development in the study area, the delineated freshwater-bearing sand section below the saltwater–freshwater interface should be considered for groundwater extraction. The depth to this transition zone varies across the area but typically greater than 160  m depth. The length of the screen depends on the aquifer thickness of individual borehole and can be separated {{if there are no}} <b>continuous</b> <b>sand</b> units in the freshwater-bearing zone to maximize the quantity of water flow into the borehole. It is suggested that a buffer zone of 20 – 40  m is in place between the screens and the saltwater–freshwater interface where there is no significant thick impermeable clay layer to seal off the productive freshwater aquifer from contamination. The annulus section just above the gravel packed and the screen should be cement grouted to the top to prevent contamination of the freshwater aquifer from the saltwater–saline water interface.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a Miocene sequence stratigraphic framework using data from recently drilled boreholes in the New Jersey Coastal Plain. Sequences are shallowing upward, unconformity-bounded units; fine-grained shelf and prodelta sediments grade upward to delta front and shallow-marine sands, corresponding to confining bed-aquifer couplets. By dating Miocene sequences using Sr-isotope stratigraphy, and mapping with borehole data and geophysical logs, we can predict the continuity and effectiveness of the confining beds and aquifers. The following are illustrated on a 904 ~ 11 basinward dip section: (1) the composite confining bed is comprised of the KwO and lower Kwla (ca. 23. 8 - 20. 5 Ma) sequences downdip at Atlantic City, and the Kw 1 b, Kw 1 a and older sequences updip (ca. 69. 3 - 20. 6 Ma), and is continuous {{throughout most of the}} coastal plain; (2) the major confined aquifer, the Atlantic City 800 -foot sand, is comprised of the upper Kwla and Kwlb sequences (ca. 20520. 2 Ma) and is an areally <b>continuous</b> <b>sand</b> that is interconnected with the Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer system updip of Mays Landing; (3) the confining bed above the Atlantic City 800 -foot sand is comprised of the Kw 2 a, Kw 2 b, and Kw 3 sequences (18. 1 - 13. 3 Ma) and is an extensive confining bed that pinches out updip. These sequences and aquifer-confining bed couplets are linked to global sea-level changes evinced by the S”O record. We conclude that sequence stratigraphy is a powerful tool when applied to regional hydrogeologic problems, although basinal tectonic differences and localized variations in sediment supply can affect aquifer thickness and permeability...|$|R
