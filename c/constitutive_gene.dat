A 2 A-R-/- mice presented unexpected alterations in locomotor behaviour regarding the specific expression of A 2 A-R in striatopallidal neurons. To clarify {{the functions of}} A 2 A-R in the striatum and to identify the mechanisms leading to these unexpected modifications, we studied the basal expression of immediate early and <b>constitutive</b> <b>genes</b> as well as dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum. Basal zif- 268 and arc mRNAs expression was reduced in mutant mice by 60 - 80 %, in the striatum but also widespreadly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Striatal expression of substance P and enkephalin mRNAs was reduced by about 50 % and 30 %, respectively, whereas the expression of GAD 67 and GAD 65 mRNAs was slightly increased and unaltered, respectively. In vivo microdialysis in the striatum revealed a 45 %-decrease in the extracellular dopamine concentration. This was associated with an up-regulation of D 1 and D 2 dopamine receptors expression. Altogether these results {{pointed out that the}} lack of A 2 A-R leads to a functional hypodopaminergic state and demonstrated that A 2 A-R are necessary to maintain a basal level in immediate early and <b>constitutive</b> <b>genes</b> expression in the striatum and cerebral cortex, possibly via their control of dopamine pathways. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Quantitative PCR and DNA {{microarray}} are modern methodologies {{for studying}} gene expression. Older methods {{were used to}} measure mRNA abundance: Differential display, RNase protection assay and Northern blot. Northern blotting {{is often used to}} estimate the expression level of a gene by visualizing the abundance of its mRNA transcript in a sample. In this method, purified RNA is separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a solid matrix (such as a nylon membrane), and probed with a specific DNA or RNA probe that is complementary to the gene of interest. Although this technique is still used to assess gene expression, it requires relatively large amounts of RNA and provides only qualitative or semi quantitative information of mRNA levels. Estimation errors arising from variations in the quantification method can be the result of DNA integrity, enzyme efficiency and many other factors. For this reason a number of standardization systems (often called normalization methods) have been developed. Some have been developed for quantifying total gene expression, but the most common are aimed at quantifying the specific gene being studied in relation to another gene called a normalizing gene, which is selected for its almost constant level of expression. These genes are often selected from housekeeping genes as their functions related to basic cellular survival normally imply <b>constitutive</b> <b>gene</b> expression. This enables researchers to report a ratio for the expression of the genes of interest divided by the expression of the selected normalizer, thereby allowing comparison of the former without actually knowing its absolute level of expression.|$|E
40|$|SummaryNuclear receptors undergo ligand-dependent {{conformational}} {{changes that}} are required for corepressor-coactivator exchange, but whether there is an actual requirement for specific epigenetic landmarks to impose ligand dependency for gene activation remains unknown. Here we report an unexpected and general strategy {{that is based on}} the requirement for specific cohorts of inhibitory histone methyltransferases (HMTs) to impose gene-specific gatekeeper functions that prevent unliganded nuclear receptors and other classes of regulated transcription factors from binding to their target gene promoters and causing <b>constitutive</b> <b>gene</b> activation in the absence of stimulating signals. This strategy, based at least in part on an HMT-dependent inhibitory histone code, imposes a requirement for specific histone demethylases, including LSD 1, to permit ligand- and signal-dependent activation of regulated gene expression. These events link an inhibitory methylation component of the histone code to a broadly used strategy that circumvents pathological <b>constitutive</b> <b>gene</b> induction by physiologically regulated transcription factors...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of plasmid-mediated gene expression control in bacteria revolutionized {{the field of}} bacteriology. Many of these expression control systems rely on the addition of small molecules, generally metabolites or non-metabolized analogs thereof, to the growth medium to induce expression of the genes of interest. The paradigmatic example of an expression control system is the lac system from Escherichia coli, which typically relies on the Ptac promoter and the Lac repressor, LacI. In many cases, however, <b>constitutive</b> <b>gene</b> expression is desired, and other experimental approaches require the coordinated control of multiple genes. While multiple systems {{have been developed for}} use in E. coli and its close relatives, the utility and/or functionality of these tools does not always translate to other species. For example, for the Gram-negative pathogen, Legionella pneumophila, a causative agent of Legionnaires' Disease, the aforementioned Ptac system represents the only well-established expression control system. In order to enhance the tools available to study bacterial gene expression in L. pneumophila, we developed a plasmid, pON. mCherry, which confers <b>constitutive</b> <b>gene</b> expression from a mutagenized LacI binding site. We demonstrate that pON. mCherry neither interferes with other plasmids harboring an intact LacI-Ptac expression system nor alters the growth of Legionella species during intracellular growth.

40|$|International audienceSpatial genome {{organization}} {{and its effect}} on transcription remains a fundamental question. We applied an advanced chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) strategy to comprehensively map higher-order chromosome folding and specific chromatin interactions mediated by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) with haplotype specificity and nucleotide resolution in different human cell lineages. We find that CTCF/cohesin-mediated interaction anchors serve as structural foci for spatial organization of <b>constitutive</b> <b>genes</b> concordant with CTCF-motif orientation, whereas RNAPII interacts within these structures by selectively drawing cell-type-specific genes toward CTCF foci for coordinated transcription. Furthermore, we show that haplotype variants and allelic interactions have differential effects on chromosome configuration, influencing gene expression, and may provide mechanistic insights into functions associated with disease susceptibility. 3 D genome simulation suggests a model of chromatin folding around chromosomal axes, where CTCF is involved in defining the interface between condensed and open compartments for structural regulation.

40|$|Expression of an {{individual}} gene can vary considerably among genetically identical cells due to stochastic fluctuations in transcription. However proteins comprising essential complexes or pathways have similar abundances and lower variability. It is not known whether coordination in the expression of subunits of essential complexes occurs {{at the level of}} transcription, mRNA abundance, or protein expression. To directly measure the level of coordination in the expression of genes, we used highly sensitive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to count individual mRNAs of functionally related and unrelated genes within single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Our results revealed that transcripts of temporally induced genes are highly correlated in individual cells. But in contrast, transcription of <b>constitutive</b> <b>genes</b> encoding essential subunits of complexes is not coordinated due to stochastic fluctuations. Therefore the coordination of these functional complexes must occur post-transcriptionally, and likely post-translationally.

40|$|We {{show that}} HEM 1 (encoding 5 -aminolevulinate synthase) expression, while {{constitutive}} under all steady-state growth conditions tested, is activated by the HAP 2 -HAP 3 global activation system that controls expression of apocytochromes. This finding creates a paradox because apocytochrome activation by HAP 2 -HAP 3 is highly regulated, subject to induction by heme, {{and subject to}} further derepression by a shift from glucose medium to one containing a nonfermentable carbon source. We clarify this issue by showing that HEM 1 is subject to two additional layers of control that mask regulatory changes. First is a second activation system acting at a site close to the HAP 2 -HAP 3 target sequence that keeps HEM 1 turned on under conditions of heme deficiency. Second is a regulated negative control site downstream of the upstream activation site that counteracts derepression in medium containing a nonfermentable carbon source. Thus, transcription of the <b>constitutive</b> <b>gene</b> is actually a composite of opposing regulatory sites. This complex regulatory arrangement may exist to allow HEM 1 to be coordinated transiently with apocytochromes for transition to respiratory growth.

In contrast to these <b>constitutive</b> <b>genes,</b> the tissue-specific alpha 2 and alpha 4 genes code for tubulins with different structures. The alpha 2 mRNA is male-specific in adults and codes for a tubulin that differs from alpha 1 at 21 of the 450 residues.

For rRNA and tRNA (stable RNA) it has previously been shown that the distinction between stringent control and growth rate control is unfounded, as the function describing the stable RNA gene activities at different concentrations of guanosine tetraphosphate is independent of growth conditions (exponential growth or amino acid starvation) and of the relA allele present. Here, the results indicated that the stringent responses of ribosomal protein genes and lac differ from their metabolic control during exponential growth in different media.

40|$|Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) such as Gcn 5 {{play a role}} in {{transcriptional}} activation. However, {{the majority}} of <b>constitutive</b> <b>genes</b> show no requirement for GCN 5, and even regulated genes, such as the yeast PHO 5 gene, {{do not seem to be}} affected significantly by its absence under normal activation conditions. Here we show that even though the steady-state level of activated PHO 5 transcription is not affected by deletion of GCN 5, the rate of activation following phosphate starvation is significantly decreased. This delay in transcriptional activation is specifically due to slow chromatin remodeling of the PHO 5 promoter, whereas the transmission of the phosphate starvation signal to the PHO 5 promoter progresses at a normal rate. Chromatin remodeling is equally delayed in a galactose-inducible PHO 5 promoter variant in which the Pho 4 binding sites have been replaced by Gal 4 binding sites. By contrast, activation of the GAL 1 gene by galactose addition occurs with normal kinetics. Lack of the histone H 4 N-termini leads to a similar delay in activation of the PHO 5 promoter. These results indicate that one important contribution of HATs is to increase the rate of gene induction by accelerating chromatin remodeling, rather than to affect the final steady-state expression levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} of chromatin structure is inevitable for proper transcriptional response in eukaryotes. Recent reports in Arabidopsis {{have suggested that}} gene responsiveness is modulated by particular chromatin status. One such feature is H 2 A. Z, a histone variant conserved among eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, H 2 A. Z is enriched within gene bodies of transcriptionally variable genes, which {{is in contrast to}} genic DNA methylation found within <b>constitutive</b> <b>genes.</b> In the absence of H 2 A. Z, the genes normally harboring H 2 A. Z within gene bodies are transcriptionally misregulated, while DNA methylation is unaffected. Therefore, H 2 A. Z may promote variability of gene expression without affecting genic DNA methylation. Another epigenetic information that could be important for gene responsiveness is trimethylation of histone H 3 lysine 4 (H 3 K 4 me 3). The level of H 3 K 4 me 3 increases when stress responsive genes are transcriptionally activated, and it decreases after recovery from the stress. Even after the recovery, however, H 3 K 4 me 3 is kept at some atypical levels, suggesting possible role of H 3 K 4 me 3 for a stress memory.

40|$|The c-fos gene {{responds}} to extracellular stimuli and undergoes robust but transient transcriptional activation. Here {{we show that}} heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R (hnRNP R) facilitates transcription reinitiation of the c-fos promoter in vitro in cooperation with Mediator. Consistently, hnRNP R interacts with the Scaffold components (Mediator, TBP, and TFIIH) as well as TFIIB, which recruits RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and TFIIF to Scaffold. The cooperative action of hnRNP R and Mediator is diminished by the cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK 8) module, which is comprised of CDK 8, Cyclin C, MED 12 and MED 13 of the Mediator subunits. Interestingly, {{we find that the}} length of the G-free cassettes, and thereby their transcripts, influences the hnRNP R-mediated facilitation of reinitiation. Indeed, indicative of a possible role of the transcript in facilitating transcription reinitiation, the RNA transcript produced from the G-free cassette interacts with hnRNP R through its RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) domain. Mutational analyses of hnRNP R indicate that facilitation of initiation and reinitiation requires distinct domains of hnRNP R. Knockdown of hnRNP R in mouse cells compromised rapid induction of the c-fos gene but did not affect transcription of <b>constitutive</b> <b>genes.</b> Together, these results suggest an important role for hnRNP R in regulating robust response of the c-fos gene...|$|R
