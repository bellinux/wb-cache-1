Setting: Level III pediatric intensive care unit. Patients: Two pediatric patients with myopathies and acute liver failure. CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS:: We determined acetaminophen protein adduct levels, in combination with a literature review and systematic evaluation of the cases, using the Roussel Uclaf <b>Causality</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Method</b> for drug-induced liver injury to assess causality between recommended acetaminophen dosing and acute liver failure in two children with myopathies. MAIN RESULTS:: The serum adduct levels {{were consistent with the}} values previously reported in children with acute liver injury following acetaminophen overdose. We found four similar cases of acute liver failure in pediatric and adult patients with myopathies following recommended acetaminophen doses in the literature (n = 3) and personal communication (n = 1). The Roussel Uclaf <b>Causality</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Method</b> suggested a probable relationship between acetaminophen use at recommended doses and acute liver failure in our myopathy patients. Conclusion: Our data suggest that some patients with myopathies who are receiving recommended doses of acetaminophen may be at increased risk for the development of toxicity resulting in acute liver failure. More studies are needed to corroborate these findings.

Several synthetic drugs are in use but their low prophylactic efficacy of 20 % to 40 % is disappointing. Instead, the proprietary herbal medicine Petadolex® (PE), an analytically and pharmacologically well-defined, processed extract from Petasites hybridus (PH), reduces the frequency of migraine attacks by 48 % to 60 %, but claims of adverse liver reactions emerged that discourage its broader use. We analyzed 10 spontaneous case reports of suspected liver injury in assumed connection {{with the use of}} PE that were presented by hospital physicians to the manufacturer, who provided all case details upon our request. Using the robust, quantitative, structured and liver specific <b>causality</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>method</b> of RUCAM (Roussel Uclaf <b>Causality</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Method),</b> causality attribution was performed for PE.

40|$|AIM: To {{analyze the}} {{validity}} of applied test criteria and <b>causality</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>methods</b> in assumed Herbalife hepatotoxicity with positive reexposure tests. METHODS: We searched the Medline database for suspected cases of Herbalife hepatotoxicity and retrieved 53 cases including eight cases with a positive unintentional reexposure and a high causality level for Herbalife. First, analysis of these eight cases focused on the data quality of the positive reexposure cases, requiring a baseline value of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) < 5 upper limit of normal (N) before reexposure, with N as the upper limit of normal, and a doubling of the ALT value at reexposure {{as compared to the}} ALT value at baseline prior to reexposure. Second, reported methods to assess causality in the eight cases were evaluated, and then the liver specific Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) scale validated for hepatotoxicity cases was used for quantitative causality reevaluation. This scale consists of various specific elements with scores provided through the respective case data, and the sum of the scores yields a causality grading for each individual case of initially suspected hepatotoxicity. RESULTS: Details of positive reexposure test conditions and their individual results were scattered in virtually all cases, since reexposures were unintentional and allowed only retrospective rather than prospective assessments. In 1 / 8 cases, criteria for a positive reexposure were fulfilled, whereas in the remaining cases the reexposure test was classified as negative (n = 1), or the data were considered as uninterpretable due to missing information to comply adequately with the criteria (n = 6). In virtually all assessed cases, liver unspecific <b>causality</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>methods</b> were applied rather than a liver specific method such as the CIOMS scale. Using this scale, causality gradings for Herbalife in these eight cases were probable (n = 1), unlikely (n = 4), and excluded (n = 3). Confounding variables included low data quality, alternative diagnoses, poor exclusion of important other causes, and comedication by drugs and herbs in 6 / 8 cases. More specifically, problems were evident in some cases regarding temporal association, daily doses, exact start and end dates of product use, actual data of laboratory parameters such as ALT, and exact dechallenge characteristics. Shortcomings included scattered exclusion of hepatitis A-C, cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr virus infection with only globally presented or lacking parameters. Hepatitis E virus infection was considered in one single patient and found positive, infections by herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus were excluded in none.

Medline, Embase and Web of Science databases were screened from January 1982 to July 2014, using appropriate key words. Only original articles in English reporting the incidence of ADE requiring ICU admission in adult patients among total ICU admissions were included. Article eligibility was assessed by two independent reviewers, a third being involved in cases of disagreement. All reported characteristics (type of ICU, characteristics of patients, incidence of ADE, severity and preventability, drugs involved, causality) in the selected articles were collected for the review. The quality of studies was independently assessed by two reviewers with a specific score that we developed. A meta-analysis was conducted. Inclusion criteria were fulfilled by 11 studies out of the 4, 311 identified in the initial literature search. The median (interquartile) quality score was 0. 61 (0. 44; 0. 69). The reported incidences of ADE requiring ICU admission in adult patients ranged from 0. 37 to 27. 4 %, with an associated mortality rate ranging from 2 to 28. 1 % and a mean length of stay ranging from 2. 3 to 6. 4 days. Preventable events accounted for 17. 5 to 85. 7 % of the events. Costs and mechanisms at the root of ADE were investigated in only two and five studies, respectively.

On the basis of Roussel Uclaf <b>Causality</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Method</b> (RUCAM) scale and with reference to Digestive Disease Week Japan scale, three parameters, i. e., “report of liver injury induced by single Chinese materia medica or Chinese patent medicine”, “eosinophil count”, and “drug lymphocyte stimulation test based on Cell Counting Kit- 8 ”, were added to establish a modified diagnostic scale. The RUCAM scale and the modified diagnostic scale were used to evaluate each suspected drug to verify the sensitivity and specificity of this new scale in the diagnosis of DILI. The chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups. ResultsThere were 75 suspected drugs in the DILI group and 41 suspected drugs in the non-DILI group. Compared with the RUCAM scale, the modified diagnostic scale increased the number of drugs evaluated as “highly probable” and “probable” from 74. 7...|$|E
40|$|Liver injury due to {{prescription}} and nonprescription medications is {{a growing}} medical, scientific, and public health problem. Worldwide, the estimated annual incidence rate of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is 13. 9 - 24. 0 per 100, 000 inhabitants. DILI {{is one of the}} leading causes of acute liver failure in the US. In Korea, the annual extrapolated incidence of cases hospitalized at university hospital is 12 / 100, 000 persons/year. Most cases of DILI are the result of idiosyncratic metabolic responses or unexpected reactions to medication. There is marked geographic variation in relevant agents; antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and psychotropic drugs are the most common offending agents in the West, whereas in Asia, 'herbs' and 'health foods or dietary supplements' are more common. Different medical circumstances also cause discrepancy in definition and classification of DILI between West and Asia. In the concern of causality assessment, the application of the Roussel Uclaf <b>Causality</b> <b>Assessment</b> <b>Method</b> (RUCAM) scale frequently undercounts the cases caused by 'herbs' due to a lack of previous information and incompatible time criteria. Therefore, a more objective and reproducible tool that could be used for the diagnosis of DILI caused by 'herbs' is needed in Asia. In addition, a reporting system similar to the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) in the US should be established as soon as possible in Asia...|$|E
40|$|<b>Causality</b> <b>assessment</b> of {{reported}} adverse drug reactions (ADR) {{is an important}} component of pharmacovigilance as they contribute to better evaluation of the risk-benefit profile of drugs. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the agreement of <b>causality</b> <b>assessments</b> of ADR between the spontaneous ADR reporters, the expert panel and the Naranjo algorithm. We retrospectively reviewed ADR reports received by the Malaysian Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (MADRAC) between January to June 2003. <b>Causality</b> <b>assessments</b> were categorized as Certain, Probable, Possible, Unlikely and Unclassifiable. A total of 384 reports were included. Spontaneous reporters assessed 30. 4 % as Certain, 46. 1 % as Probable, 21. 9 % as Possible and 1. 6 % as Unlikely. MADRAC panel assessed 21. 9 %, 13. 0 %, 64. 6 % and 0. 5 % as Certain, Probable, Possible and Unlikely, respectively. Using the algorithm, 16. 4 %, 83. 1 % and 0. 5 % were categorized as Probable, Possible and Unlikely, respectively. No reports achieved the Certain/Definite category using the algorithm. The total percentage of agreement between spontaneous reporters, MADRAC and Naranjo’s algorithm in <b>causality</b> <b>assessment</b> was 15. 1 %. Among the three groups, no agreement was found in the Certain and Unlikely categories. Spontaneous reporters attributed a higher level of causality compared to MADRAC and Naranjo’s algorithm. The difference in aims and <b>methods</b> in <b>causality</b> <b>assessment</b> among the three <b>methods</b> of <b>assessment</b> could be the main reason of disagreement...|$|R
