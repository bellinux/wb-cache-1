This carbohydrate-binding protein has been found to include both collagenous and non-collagenous domains. Electron micrographs of bovine <b>conglutinin</b> are presented in which <b>conglutinin</b> appears as a tetramer of four 'lollipop' structures emanating from a central hub.

40|$|<b>Conglutinin</b> is a Ca 2 +-dependent, carbohydrate-binding, {{serum protein}} which {{contains}} an N-terminal collagen-like region and a C-terminal, C-type lectin domain. To date, <b>conglutinin,</b> {{which appears to}} play an important role in defence mechanisms, has been fully described, by protein sequence analysis, only in the bovine system. To allow comparison of lung surfactant protein D (SP-D) with <b>conglutinin,</b> within one species, a full-length cDNA clone for SP-D has been isolated from a bovine lung library. The derived amino acid sequence for bovine SP-D shows a higher (78 %) level of identity to the sequence of <b>conglutinin</b> than to the sequence of human or rat SP-D (67 and 65 % respectively). However, SP-D and <b>conglutinin</b> are known to have different carbohydrate-binding specificities, therefore some of the 16 residues conserved in the C-type lectin domains of all three species of SP-D, but which are not conserved in <b>conglutinin,</b> appear likely to be involved in determination of specificity. The use of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -derived DNA probe for bovine SP-D in Northern blotting studies yielded a signal from bovine liver mRNA as well as the expected signal from bovine lung mRNA.

40|$|<b>Conglutinin</b> is a {{bovine serum}} protein which was first {{described}} as a vertebrate lectin. This protein belongs {{to the family of}} C-type lectins. These lectins are composed of four characteristic domains: (1) an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, (2) a collagen-like domain, (3) a neck domain and (4) a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Recently lectins have been shown to function as immunoglobulin-independent defence molecules due to a complement-mediated mechanism or opsonization. Our previous study showed that bovine <b>conglutinin</b> can inhibit haemagglutination by influenza A viruses and act by directly neutralizing them due to its lectin properties. In order to elucidate the biological role of the collagen-like domain, a recombinant partial <b>conglutinin</b> lacking this collagen-like domain was produced in an Escherichia coli system and its biological activities were examined. A 497 bp sequence, consisting of a short collagen region (two repeats of G-X-Y amino acid sequences), the neck domain, and the CRD of <b>conglutinin</b> cDNA, was amplified by the reverse-transcriptase PCR technique. The cDNA was transferred to a bacterial expression vector system (pRSET-A) and stable transfectants {{with a high level of}} <b>conglutinin</b> production were obtained. SDS/PAGE and Western blotting analyses showed a recombinant fusion protein of 27 kDa. Results of a cross-linking study and gel-filtration assay indicated that the recombinant <b>conglutinin</b> can form a trimeric structure and that it has sugar binding activity and specificity similar to that of native <b>conglutinin.</b> The recombinant <b>conglutinin</b> was also found to inhibit haemagglutination caused by influenza A virus as well as to possess less conglutination activity. These results suggest that in order for <b>conglutinin</b> to inhibit haemagglutination caused by the influenza virus, as well as to have sugar binding activity or to form trimers, it does not require the N-terminal and collagenous domains; however, they are essential for full conglutination activity...|$|E

40|$|Bovine <b>conglutinin</b> is a serum lectin that agglutinates {{erythrocytes}} preincubated with antibodies and complement. This agglutination occurs {{through the}} binding of <b>conglutinin</b> to iC 3 b, {{a fragment of}} the complement component C 3. It was reported that <b>conglutinin</b> binds fluid-phase C 3 b and C 3 c as well as iC 3 b. We re-investigated the reactivity of <b>conglutinin</b> towards fluid-phase C 3 degradation products. ELISA wells were coated with <b>conglutinin</b> and reacted with C 3 split products generated in normal human serum, in factor I-deficient serum, or in factor I-depleted serum. Conglutinin-bound C 3 fragments were detected with anti-C 3 c and anti-C 3 d antibodies. An increased signal was observed during the activation of complement in normal human serum with the peak response after 1 - 2 hr, following which the signal decreased, reaching background level after 72 hr. The oligosaccharides on C 3 c, generated in serum, are thus not recognized by <b>conglutinin.</b> No signal was observed when factor I-deficient serum or factor I-depleted serum was used instead of normal serum. Reconstitution with purified factor I re-established the normal pattern. Examination of the conglutinin-bound C 3 molecules by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-C 3 c and anti-C 3 d antibodies revealed bands characteristic for iC 3 b, and no bands corresponding to C 3 b or C 3 c. Reduction of the disulphide bonds prior to the incubation of the activated serum with the conglutinin-coated wells revealed a band of 63, 000 MW, characteristic of the N-terminal fragment of the alpha-chain of iC 3 b. We also investigated the binding to the solid-phase <b>conglutinin</b> of purified C 3 and degradation products generated with enzymes. In this case, C 3 as well as C 3 b and C 3 c were bound, suggesting conformational changes in C 3 during purification.

40|$|Bovine <b>conglutinin</b> is a collagen-like, C-type, plasma lectin which {{belongs to}} the group of {{proteins}} called 'collectins'. Two inosine-containing oligonucleotides were synthesized, based on the published protein sequence for bovine <b>conglutinin</b> [Lee, Leiby, Allar, Paris, Lerch and Okarma (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2715 - 2723], and PCR on target DNA from a bovine liver lambda gt 11 cDNA library yielded a product of the expected size of 210 bp. Screening of the library with this cDNA fragment identified a single positive clone, with an insert of 0. 9 kb, coding for bovine <b>conglutinin</b> from residue 70 to the C-terminus. The 5 ' cDNA sequence, encompassing 150 bp of the 5 ' non-translated sequence plus the sequence encoding the leader peptide and the N-terminal residues 1 - 70, was completed by the use of PCR techniques. The cDNA sequence of bovine <b>conglutinin</b> showed 86 % identity with that of bovine lung surfactant protein D (SP-D), and the derived amino acid sequence of bovine <b>conglutinin</b> showed 78 % identity with that of bovine SP-D, which included complete identity of the leader-peptide sequences. The amino acid sequence derived from the cDNA sequence differs from the published protein sequence at four positions. Northern-blot analysis on total RNA, purified from various tissues from cattle, sheep, humans, rats and mice, showed that a strong signal of approx. 1. 8 kb is present in bovine liver RNA. A weak signal of similar size was also observed in sheep liver, but not in human, rat and mouse livers. A weak signal, also of 1. 8 kb, is present in the lung RNAs of all the species tested. The signals from the lung tissues are likely to be due to the cross-hybridization of the bovine <b>conglutinin</b> cDNA to the SP-D mRNAs of the respective species. The finding of significant signals in only the bovine and sheep liver RNA samples is indicative that serum <b>conglutinin</b> may be present in significant amounts only in members of the Bovidae (the family encompassing cattle, antelopes, sheep and goats) and closely related species...|$|E

Plasma levels of <b>conglutinin</b> in cattle were assayed by rocket immunoelectrophoresis to examine whether they were genetically determined. Samples were collected from calves (309 bull-calves and 260 heifers with complex pedigree relationships). The number of respiratory infections from the 42 nd to 336 th day of life was recorded. The number of infections was found to be genetically determined (heritability: h 2 = 0. 31 +/- 0. 07). A wide concentration range of <b>conglutinin</b> was found in plasma (< 1. 25 - 35 micrograms/ml for females, geometric mean 8. 1 micrograms/ml, and < 1. 25 - 47 micrograms/ml for males, geometric mean 15. 5 micrograms/ml), and the concentrations was found to be genetically determined (heritability, h 2 = 0. 52 +/- 0. 07). The analysis revealed a negative association between disease frequency and the <b>conglutinin</b> levels (- 0. 56 +/- 0. 18 for female; - 0. 50 +/- 0. 18 for male). Levels of <b>conglutinin</b> below the detection limit of the assay (1. 25 micrograms/ml) were found in 2 % of the animals. If these animals are assumed to be homozygous for a single recessive allele causing low concentrations a gene frequency of 0. 15 could be calculated.

40|$|The surfactant-associated protein A (SP-A) {{belongs to}} the collectin family, a group of C-type lectins {{encompassing}} also surfactant-associated protein D, mannan-binding protein (MBP) and <b>conglutinin.</b> These proteins all have carbohydrate-recognition domains joined to collagen stalks. It seems likely that SP-A, like MBP and <b>conglutinin,</b> may mediate anti-microbial activity through binding to carbohydrates on the microorganisms and collectin receptors on phagocytic cells. We have studied the influence of carbohydrates on the binding of SP-A, MBP and <b>conglutinin</b> to mannan in an enzyme-linked lectin-binding assay. All sugars were of D-configuration, except fucose of which both L- and D-configurations were tested. The order of inhibiting potency on the binding of SP-A was: N-acetylmannosamine > L-fucose, maltose > glucose > mannose. The following sugars were non-inhibitory: galactose, D-fucose, glucosamine, mannosamine, galactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine. The best inhibitor of MBP was N-acetylglucosamine. Otherwise MBP showed a selectivity {{similar to that of}} SP-A. <b>Conglutinin</b> binding was inhibited by all the sugars examined except N-acetylgalactosamine. For <b>conglutinin,</b> as for MBP, the best inhibitor was N-acetylglucosamine. Normal human SP-A, alveolar-proteinosis SP-A purified by ion-exchange chromatography, and alveolar-proteinosis SP-A purified by n-butanol extraction showed no difference in sugar selectivity.

40|$|Collectin {{receptor}} (Clq receptor) {{has been}} shown to bind human Clq, mannose-binding protein (MBP), lung surfactant protein A (SP-A) and bovine <b>conglutinin.</b> These ligands have a similar ultrastructure, each consisting of collagenous and globular domains, but do not show a high degree of sequence similarity.

Within the collagenous region, near the 'bend' region of the collagen triple helix in Clq, MBP and SP-A, a cluster of similar charged residues is observed.

40|$|Collectins play {{important}} roles in host defense against infectious microorganisms. We now demonstrate that the serum collectins mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and <b>conglutinin</b> have less ability to bind to, aggregate, and enhance neutrophil uptake of several strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria than pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D). Collectins are composed of four major structural domains (i. e., N-terminal, collagen, and neck and carbohydrate recognition domains). To determine which domains of SP-D are responsible for its greater bacterial binding or aggregating activity, activities of chimeric collectins containing the N-terminal and collagen domains of SP-D coupled to the neck recognition domains and carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of MBL or <b>conglutinin</b> (SP-D/Congneck+CRD and SP-D/MBLneck+CRD) were tested. The SP-D/Congneck+CRD and SP-D/MBLneck+CRD chimeras bound to and aggregated the bacteria more strongly than did wild-type MBL or <b>conglutinin.</b> SP-D/MBLneck+CRD also enhanced neutrophil uptake of bacteria more so than MBL. Hence, the SP-D N-terminal and/or collagen domains contribute to the enhanced bacterial binding and aggregating activities of SP-D. In prior studies, SP-D/Congneck+CRD and SP-D/MBLneck+CRD had increased ability to bind to influenza virus compared not only with that of <b>conglutinin</b> or MBL but with that of wild-type SP-D as well. In contrast, the chimeras had either reduced or unchanged ability to bind to or aggregate bacteria {{compared to that of}} wild-type SP-D. Hence, although replacement of the neck recognition domains and CRDs of SP-D with those of MBL and <b>conglutinin</b> conferred increased viral binding activity, it did not favorably affect bacterial binding activity, suggesting that requirements for optimal collectin binding to influenza virus and bacteria differ...|$|E

40|$|Collectin- 43 (CL- 43) is a C-type serum lectin and {{a member}} of the collectin family of soluble {{proteins}} that are effector molecules in innate immunity. We have investigated the binding specificity of CL- 43 using as model systems a panel of structurally defined oligosaccharides in the form of neoglycolipids, and several glycoproteins derived from the complement glycoprotein C 3 during activation of the complement cascade. A specificity is revealed towards fucose as part of the Lea oligosaccharide sequence, and towards mannose as found on high mannose-type chains. These are features shared with other serum collectins, <b>conglutinin</b> and mannan-binding proteins; a major difference is the lack of detectable binding by CL- 43 to N-glycosidic oligosaccharides terminating in N-acetylglucosamine. CL- 43 has a unique pattern of reactivity towards high mannose-type oligosaccharides on the two glycosylation sites of C 3 and derived glycoproteins: it binds to C 3 c (not bound by <b>conglutinin</b> and mannan-binding protein) but not to hydrolysed C 3 [C 3 (H 2 O) ], C 3 b or iC 3 b immobilized on microwells (all bound by <b>conglutinin</b> but not by mannan-binding protein). When these glycoproteins are sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) -treated and immobilized on nitrocellulose, CL- 43 (but not <b>conglutinin</b> nor mannan-binding protein) binds strongly to C 3 (H 2 O), iC 3 b and C 3 c. The salient conclusions are, first, that there are remarkable positive or negative effects of carrier protein on oligosaccharide presentation and these differ for the individual collectins. Second, the different though partially overlapping binding patterns among the collectins may be important for their function as circulating effector molecules with broad surveillance capabilities...|$|E

40|$|A {{receptor}} binding to the Clq subcomponent of complement hasbeen reported by many workers. In this paper we {{report for the}} first time that Clq receptor binds not only to Clq, but also to three other structurally similar ligands, namely mannan binding protein (MBP), <b>conglutinin,</b> and lung surfactant protein (SP-A). All these ligands have been reported to enhance removal of species bound to their globular domain from blood (MBP, <b>conglutinin,</b> Clq) or lung (SP-A) through phagocytosis. One of the possible roles for ligand-{{receptor binding}} may be initiation of phagocytosis. The existence of a cell surface receptor for the complement protein Clq was first suggested in 1972 (1). The ligand Clq has a complex structure made up of six globular regions, each attached to a short collagen triple helix (2). Clq receptor (C 1 gR) binds to the collagenous region of C 1 q (3), but does not appear to be a general receptor for structural collagens (4). C 1 gR is an acidic glycoprotein with 15 - 20 % carbohydrate (4). The detergent-solubilized protein is an elongated dimer of Mr 115, 000 ± 7, 000 and remains soluble in the absence of detergent (4). ClgR activity is found on most leukocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and platelets (5, 6), and binding of Clq to its receptor has been reported to mediate a range of phenomena, including phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC),t modulation of cytokine and immunoglobulin secretion, and polymorph-endothelium interaction (6, 7). Recently, three other proteins, mannan binding protein (MBP), lung surfactant protein (SRA), and bovine <b>conglutinin,</b> which have similar primary structure to C 1 q, have been characterized. Each has collagenous and globular domains (reviewed in reference 8). Availability of the pure receptor (4, 9) prompted examination of its possible interaction with these three proteins, human MBP, human recombinant SP-A, and bovine <b>conglutinin,</b> which are known to be similar in ultrastructure to Clq (8) (MBP and SP-A: Fig. 1) or to have functional association with the complement system (10, 11) (MBP and conglutinin: Fig. 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Collectin- 43 (CL- 43) is a {{bovine serum}} protein that is {{composed}} of subunits of three identical chains, each of which contains a collagen region and a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain; thus, CL- 43 belongs to the collectins (group III of the C-type lectins). We have derived the complete primary sequence of CL- 43 using partial protein sequencing, cDNA cloning, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction techniques. The primary sequence of CL- 43 shows that it contains an N-terminal region of 28 residues, followed by a collagenous domain of 38 repeats of Gly-Xaa-Yaa and then a C- terminal section of 159 residues, containing a short 'neck' region and the carbohydrate recognition domain with the conserved residues found in all C- type lectins. The amino acid sequence of CL- 43 showed 74 % identity to bovine <b>conglutinin</b> and 70 % identity to bovine lung surfactant protein D (SP-D), but the collagen region is considerably shorter than the 57 Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets found in <b>conglutinin</b> and SP-D. Northern blot analysis showed that CL- 43 was only synthesized in bovine liver, with no detectable signal {{in a variety of}} other bovine tissues, including lung. No cross-hybridizing signals were detected in mRNA from sheep, human, rat, or mouse liver. Since CL- 43 and <b>conglutinin</b> have only been detected in members of bovidae, it is probable that an ancestral gene of these two proteins was first derived from a SP-D- like gene, and that this ancestral gene duplicated during evolution. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
