2500|$|Vol. 2 was {{the first}} film to be shot with an 8K {{resolution}} camera, the Red Weapon 8K. Gunn had wanted to use a different camera than the Alexa 65 {{that had been used}} for several other Marvel films, because he found it to be a [...] "very big and heavy camera". He wanted a camera that could deliver equivalent image quality to the Alexa 65, and tested multiple options. He eventually met with Red, whom he had a positive experience with working on The Legend of Tarzan, and they introduced him to an early prototype for the Weapon 8K. He, Gunn, and Marvel decided to use the camera in September 2015, when only that single prototype existed, and spent months working with Red to get the <b>camera</b> <b>ready</b> for filming. For the sequence where Rocket and Yondu escape from the Ravagers, a Phantom Camera was used to film scenes up to 2000 frames per second, with the footage able to be moved from slow-motion to high-speed within a single shot. Each shot using the camera had to be carefully set up and choreographed. Additional scenes were also shot in IMAX and its aspect ratio. Braham filmed almost 85 percent of the film using a stabilizing technology he had contributed to called Stabileye, which he called [...] "a handheld dolly" [...] which allowed [...] "a spontaneity to the way the camera moves that is different and that felt appropriate for this movie." [...] For filming the cockpits of spaceships, Braham surrounded the practical sets with video panels and other light sources that he could use to create realistic lighting no matter the environment outside the ship. Exteriors of the ships were filmed with the camera on a technocrane, but any shots inside the cockpits again used the Stabileye which is [...] "so small that you can get it in there next to the actors".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who I am and what I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look <b>camera</b> <b>ready.</b> She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E

In an interview from 1997 Jones said that the reason he didn't wear the same stage clothes was that he asked the crew if they would be filming on those nights and was told no.

As he approaches the altar, the dagger nearly kills him. The photographic evidence settles it, though—there is a rational explanation. The somewhat demented elderly gentleman of the manor house has armed an ancient trap that guards the altar: a spring mechanism designed to fling the dagger when the altar gate is opened.
