5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
25|$|A {{celebration of}} {{everything}} dark and nasty. It <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> V Empire; it's really fast and brutal, with some nice drop-downs and weird bits.|$|E
60|$|The noise <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the old drift, and {{the level}} was {{examined}} thoroughly, but without success.|$|R
50|$|This song has {{an old-time}} feel, with a ragtime sound and lyrics that <b>could</b> easily <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|This {{suggests}} that a separate type of knowledge contributes to the self-concept, as W.J.'s knowledge <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> her episodic memory.|$|R
25|$|A further, rare, variant is {{the type}} 28A twin, which has two main gun embrasures on {{adjacent}} walls giving two possible firing positions for the one main gun together with two adjacent infantry chambers. These are mainly concentrated in the Sulham valley where attack <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> both the south and west.|$|E
25|$|It {{was shown}} {{experimentally}} in 1972 {{that in a}} double-slit system where only one slit was open at any time, interference was nonetheless observed provided the path difference was such that the detected photon <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> either slit. The experimental conditions were such that the photon density in the system was much less than unity.|$|E
25|$|Strictly {{the name}} White Side {{refers to the}} western slope of a nameless summit. However it is often applied to the whole fell for {{convenience}} as was done by Alfred Wainwright. He gave White Side {{the status of a}} separate fell, a position followed by other guidebook writers. Wainwright suggested that the fell name <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the quartz found on the western slope.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} had its first documentary mention in 1248. The placename Stadelhofen {{is believed to}} mean “at the farms furnished with a barn”. However, it <b>could</b> also <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a corrupted personal name.|$|R
50|$|The name Salt {{probably}} <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Latin word saltus {{which means}} valley of trees or thick forest {{as there are}} many trees in the area. It <b>could</b> <b>have</b> also <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Saranac salta meaning hard stone.|$|R
25|$|The sand on Titan {{might have}} formed when liquid methane rained and eroded the ice bedrock, {{possibly}} {{in the form}} of flash floods. Alternatively, the sand <b>could</b> also <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> organic solids produced by photochemical reactions in Titan's atmosphere.|$|R
25|$|Internal {{fittings}} {{include a}} mid 13th-century piscina which is joined to three sedilia by continuous moulded scrollwork. Above this, two blocked archways rise and {{meet at a}} corbel carved with a sheep's head. This may be Norman and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> elsewhere in the church. There are also carvings representing monks' heads supporting statues. Apart from the main piscina, two others survive elsewhere in the church, suggesting {{that there may have}} been two subsidiary altars at one point.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, the {{rotation}} system came under review, {{and a new}} system was proposed which renders ineligible for bidding only the last two World Cup host confederations. This proposal was adopted on 29 October 2007, in Zurich, Switzerland by FIFA's Executive Committee. Under this policy, a 2018 bid <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> North America, Asia, Europe, or Oceania, as Africa and South America are ineligible. Likewise, no CONMEBOL member {{could have made a}} 2022 bid, and candidates from the same confederation as the successful 2018 applicant would be disregarded in the 2022 selection procedure.|$|E
25|$|Fingerprint identification, {{known as}} dactyloscopy, or hand print identification, {{is the process}} of {{comparing}} two instances of friction ridge skin impressions (see Minutiae), from human fingers or toes, or even the palm of the hand or sole of the foot, to determine whether these impressions <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the same individual. The flexibility of friction ridge skin means that no two finger or palm prints are ever exactly alike in every detail; even two impressions recorded immediately after each other from the same hand may be slightly different. Fingerprint identification, also referred to as individualization, involves an expert, or an expert computer system operating under threshold scoring rules, determining whether two friction ridge impressions are likely to have originated from the same finger or palm (or toe or sole).|$|E
5000|$|The PopMatters {{review by}} Will Layman states [...] "Piano Sutras is a glorious, generous, fully mature {{expression}} of creativity that <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> one artist. It {{is as good}} and adventurous as jazz {{is going to sound}} in 2013." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{analysis}} of Le Vaillant's collections made by Carl Sundevall in 1857 identified ten birds {{that could not}} be assigned definitely to any species, ten that were fabricated from multiple species and fifty species that <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Cape region as claimed.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are only}} two women in the house, Sir Henry," [...] he answered. [...] "One is the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my wife, and I can answer for it that the sound <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> her." ...|$|R
25|$|On 7 March 2012, a {{forensic}} pathologist, Dr Nathaniel Cary {{told the jury}} that David Gilroy had curved scratches on his hands a cut on his forehead, bruises {{on his chest and}} other scratches to his hands, wrist and forearms on 6 May 2010. A series of photographs were produced in court (left). He told the advocate depute that the scratches could have been caused by another person's fingernails, possibly in a struggle, and that this had happened around the time Ms Pilley went missing. He also said that the injuries were consistent with what he had seen previously in cases involving strangulation, but that it was difficult to tell because the injuries had been covered with a make-up like substance. Under cross-examination Dr Cary confirmed that the scratches on Gilroy's hands <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> gardening activities.|$|E
500|$|Cellular origin theory : Some viruses {{may have}} evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that [...] "escaped" [...] from {{the genes of}} a larger organism. The escaped DNA <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria.|$|E
500|$|... "4 in the Morning" [...] was {{generally}} well received by music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it [...] "coolly sensual", noting that [...] "those celebrations of cool synths and stylish pop hooks that work {{the best for}} Stefani." [...] Billboard editor Chuck Taylor called it [...] "a melodic retro ballad that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> 1983's Flashdance ...|$|E
50|$|The RAN {{claimed that}} the {{covering}} of the carley float did not match those used by Australian warships and thus <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Sydney. Historian Tom Frame was also sceptical regarding the raft's origins and stated that its connections to the Sydney were circumstantial.|$|R
50|$|In May 2014 {{a report}} by the World Health Organization showed that the nearby town of La Línea de la Concepción had the worst air quality in Spain. The report {{concentrated}} on PM10 and PM2.5 Pollutants in the air, which <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the refinery.|$|R
50|$|Nobody {{believed}} the balloons <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> directly <b>from</b> Japan. It {{was thought that}} the balloons must be coming from North American beaches, launched by landing parties from submarines. Wilder theories speculated that they <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been launched from German prisoner of war camps in the U.S., or even from Japanese-American internment centers.|$|R
500|$|Cellular origin {{hypothesis}} : Some viruses {{may have}} evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that [...] "escaped" [...] from {{the genes of}} a larger organism. The escaped DNA <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> plasmids (pieces of naked DNA that can move between cells) or transposons (molecules of DNA that replicate and move around to different positions within the genes of the cell). Once called [...] "jumping genes", transposons are examples of mobile genetic elements and could be the origin of some viruses. They were discovered in maize by Barbara McClintock in 1950. This is sometimes called the vagrancy hypothesis, or the escape hypothesis.|$|E
500|$|In late February 2016, {{an object}} (with a stencilled text [...] "NO STEP" [...] on it) was found {{off the coast}} of Mozambique; early {{photographic}} analysis suggested it <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser or the leading edges of the wings. It was found by Blaine Gibson on a sandbank in the Mozambique Channel, between Mozambique in eastern Africa and Madagascar; and in the same part of the southern Indian Ocean where the flaperon had been found the previous July. The fragment was sent to Australia where experts identified it as almost certainly a horizontal stabilizer panel from MH370.|$|E
500|$|Richard Maibaum {{was once}} again the {{scriptwriter}} for the story, assisted by Michael G. Wilson. [...] According to Wilson, the ideas <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> anyone as a committee that could include Broccoli, Maibaum, Wilson, Glen and stunt coordinators worked on the outlines. Much of {{the inspiration for the}} stories for the film came from two Fleming short stories from the collection For Your Eyes Only: [...] "Risico" [...] and [...] "For Your Eyes Only". Another set-piece from the novel of Live and Let Die—the keelhauling—which was unused in that novel's adaptation, was inserted into the plot.|$|E

50|$|Minor {{friction}} results between Worden and his sergeant on this case. A civilian {{suspect was}} a possibility, but the exposition of this development {{by a reporter}} shut down that investigative alley, and infuriated Worden and Rick James, his partner, as they knew that information <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> a police officer.|$|R
5000|$|Mitchell has {{described}} the album as [...] "really inspired... there is this restless feeling throughout it... The sweet loneliness of solitary travel", and has said that [...] "I suppose {{a lot of people}} <b>could</b> <b>have</b> written a lot of my other songs, but I feel the songs on Hejira <b>could</b> only <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> me." ...|$|R
500|$|AllMusic's Matthew Greenwald found [...] "All in Love Is Fair" [...] to {{be among}} Wonder's [...] "finest ballad statements", which {{contained}} [...] "one of the most graceful and memorable hooks from the era". Brian Ives of radio.com {{described it as a}} [...] "beautiful and sad piano ballad" [...] that he thought <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the Broadway stage. Robert Christgau disliked Wonder's balladry singing in [...] "All in Love Is Fair", and considered his performance to be [...] "immature". In contrast, author James E. Perone wrote that there was [...] "no better example" [...] of a [...] "pure, autobiographical-sounding vocal showpiece for Stevie Wonder".|$|E
500|$|The {{revelation of}} Ned's age was much {{discussed}} among the writers, and Scully {{stated that they}} argued over [...] "how old they could get away with", since Ned had [...] "lived such a pure life" [...] and had [...] "taken such good care of himself". The writers kept pitching {{for him to be}} older and older, eventually debating whether his age would be 57 or 58. [...] They then decided on 60, [...] an idea that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> Ron Hauge, one of the Simpsons writers. A few weeks before the discussions, after having found out that he was slightly older than the next oldest writer in the staff, Hauge had told one of the writers, in [...] "the most serious reasonable" [...] voice, that he was 60 years old. At the time, Hauge was [...] "around 40" [...] years old.|$|E
500|$|Bernard Matthews {{had been}} {{importing}} 38tons of partly processed turkey meat {{on a weekly}} basis from their Saga Foods company, in Sárvár, Hungary, to a processing plant next to the farm. Though Saga Foods lies [...] from where the recent Hungarian H5N1 outbreak had occurred, a company director admitted it was [...] "possible" [...] that some of the meat <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the exclusion zone. In response to this revelation, Whitehall expressed concern over biosecurity and whether any meat may have been distributed for human consumption in Britain. On 9 February 2007 the Hungarian authorities started an investigation to try to establish whether there was a connection between the Suffolk and Hungarian outbreaks. On 11 February the investigation revealed that turkey products were still being transported, in both directions, between the plant and Hungary with EU regulations being cited as the reason why a transport ban could not be imposed.|$|E
5000|$|... "I can't {{even imagine}} {{what he would have}} become had he not been in that accident," [...] said Brad Paisley, a guitarist and {{contemporary}} country hit-maker who received a Grammy nomination for his own version of [...] "Sugarfoot Rag."

50|$|At {{the same}} time, she slowly uncovers the truth: Patricia's murderer was Estrella (Gloria Münchmeyer), who killed Patricia {{because she was}} expecting a baby that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{possibly}} <b>come</b> <b>from</b> her affair with Estrella's husband Donato (Jaime Vadell) who might have left Estrella to be with Patricia and their baby.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996 Sullivan {{published}} The Price of Experience: Money, Power, Image, and Murder in Los Angeles, {{his long}} awaited {{book about the}} Billionaire Boys Club. He spent ten years researching and writing the book; a book that Dick Adler of The LA Times described as “monumental." [...] Sullivans research included “hundreds of sources… eight former BBC members,” and personal jail-written letters from BBC ringleader Joe Hunt. The Price of Experience received positive reviews from the LA Times; The New Yorker; and The Boston Globe, among others. However, {{the release of the}} book was not without controversy; Sullivan received an anonymous death threat before a scheduled public book reading (which was subsequently cancelled); it is speculated that the threat <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> someone affiliated with former members of the BBC.|$|R
