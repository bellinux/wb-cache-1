Regular allergy testing of relevant allergens {{provides information on}} if and how patient management can be changed, {{in order to improve}} health and quality of life. Annual testing is often the practice for determining whether allergy to milk, egg, soy, and wheat have been outgrown, and the testing interval is extended to 2–3 years for allergy to peanut, tree nuts, fish, and crustacean shellfish. Results of follow-up testing <b>can</b> <b>guide</b> decision-making regarding whether and when it is safe to introduce or re-introduce allergenic food into the diet.|$|E
25|$|The art of divination is {{generally}} employed {{for the purpose}} of obtaining information that <b>can</b> <b>guide</b> the adept in his Great Work. The underlying theory states that there exists intelligences (either outside of or inside the mind of the diviner) that can offer accurate information within certain limits using a language of symbols. Normally, divination within Magick {{is not the same as}} fortune telling, which is more interested in predicting future events. Rather, divination tends to be more about discovering information about the nature and condition of things that can help the magician gain insight and to make better decisions.|$|E
25|$|The South African Air Force's Saab JAS 39 Gripen fighter {{aircraft}} are also equipped with PS-05/A pulse-doppler X-band multi-mode radar, developed by Ericsson and GEC-Marconi. This all-weather radar system {{is capable of}} locating and identifying air targets 120km away and surface targets 70km away. It is also able to automatically track multiple targets in {{the upper and lower}} spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air. It <b>can</b> <b>guide</b> several beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously (although the Air Force still lacks modern beyond visual range missile capability). When deployed operationally on combat missions and air patrols the aircraft can link their systems to the South African National Defence Force's digital network protocol, Link ZA, to share data with other radar systems to help create a wider picture as to the situation in the air and on the ground in order to rapidly adapt to a change in short term situations.|$|E

500|$|If danger threatens, {{the chicks}} crouch under a plant or any cover that offers, their dappled brown down merging {{into the desert}} scene. The parents are very {{vigilant}} in defence of their family. If a jackal approaches, an adult gives a warning cry and all crouch down and freeze. Usually the enemy fails to notice them and passes by. If it gets too close, one of the parents tries to lure it away by flapping along the ground, pretending to be injured and helpless. When the jackal has been led far enough away, the adult [...] "recovers" [...] and flies off. After three or four days, the chicks can be left alone while both parents visit the water hole, and the chicks <b>can</b> <b>guide</b> them back with their [...] "queet - queet" [...] cries.|$|E

He sends {{his army}} of demons to ravage the land, and he captures Princess Aurora and holds her captive in the Climactic Castle, {{where he would}} rule over the invading demons. He also steals the eight medallions, which he now {{controls}} for evil purposes; he scatters the eight medallions across the four spheres and places them in crypts. A young warrior named Jazeta arrives at the Sacred Shine, where he is given a [...] "charmed compass" [...] which [...] "has {{the force of the}} medallions" [...] and <b>can</b> <b>guide</b> him to them. He is also told that he would inherit the wisdom of his ancestors and win the Princess' love if victorious. Jazeta then ventures out to defeat Dirth and rescue Princess Aurora, so that she can free Dirth's spell over the ancient ancestors' spirits and use the medallions to restore peace to Neutopia.|$|E

500|$|The Gripen entered service {{using the}} PS-05/A pulse-Doppler X band {{multi-mode}} radar, developed by Ericsson and GEC-Marconi, {{which is based}} on the latter's advanced Blue Vixen radar for the Sea Harrier that also served {{as the basis for the}} Eurofighter's CAPTOR radar. The all-weather radar is capable of locating and identifying targets 120km (74mi) away, and automatically tracking multiple targets in the upper and lower spheres, on the ground and sea or in the air. [...] It <b>can</b> <b>guide</b> several beyond visual range air-to-air missiles to multiple targets simultaneously. [...] Saab stated the PS-05/A is able to handle all types of air defense, air-to-surface, and reconnaissance missions, and is developing a Mark 4 upgrade to it. [...] The Mark 4 version has a 150% increase in high-altitude air-to-air detection ranges, detection and tracking of smaller targets at current ranges, 140% improvement in air-to-air mode at low altitude, and full integration of modern weapons such as the AIM-120C-7 AMRAAM, AIM-9X Sidewinder, and MBDA Meteor missiles.|$|E

Zeeman guides allow for the guiding also of atoms while an electric <b>guide</b> <b>can,</b> if properly operated, be used both for hfs and lfs.

2500|$|By late in 1632, the New United States-led {{coalition}} of the Confederated Principalities of Europe had become the arsenal and financier (through Jewish connections of real historical interest) for Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus. This leads the scheming Cardinal Richelieu, who'd been previously financing him to spite and weaken the Habsburgs, {{to turn on the}} Swedes. Various books from up-time Grantville, especially history books, had found avid readers amongst Europe's ruling elites, changing the plans and strategies of major players of the time. The readers, not understanding the chaotic nature of events (i.e., trivial-seeming changes can have large effects, and vice versa), often believe that these histories give them a strong idea of how they <b>can</b> <b>guide</b> events in a different direction.
