It shows how the corporation improves energy efficiencies and how it changes constitution of fuel [...] converting oil consumption to coal.

The burner system comprises a burner section, a flame exit nozzle, a fuel nozzle section, and an air tube by which preheated air is directed into the burner section. Regulated air pressure is delivered to a fuel nozzle. Means are provided for directing a mixture of <b>coal</b> particles and <b>oil</b> from a drum to a nozzle at a desired rate and pressure while means returns excess fuel to the fuel drum.

40|$|The {{low-temperature}} oxidation law of {{coal and}} rock mass {{is the basis}} to study spontaneous combustion in goafs. In this paper, the low-temperature oxidation laws of <b>coal,</b> <b>oil</b> shale, and <b>mixtures</b> of <b>coal</b> and <b>oil</b> shale were studied by using laboratory programmed heating experiments combined with a field beam tube monitoring system. The results from the programmed heating experiments showed that the heat released from oil shale was less than that from coal. Coal had a lower carbon monoxide (CO) -producing temperature than oil shale, and the mixture showed obvious inhibiting effects on CO production with an average CO concentration of about 38 % of that for coal. Index gases were selected in different stages to determine the critical turning point temperature for each stage. The field beam tube monitoring system showed that the temperature field of the 1105 co-mining face of <b>coal</b> and <b>oil</b> shale in the goaf of the Liangjia Coal Mine presented a ladder-like distribution, and CO concentration was the highest for coal and lower for the <b>mixture</b> of <b>coal</b> and <b>oil</b> shale, indicating that the <b>mixture</b> of <b>coal</b> with <b>oil</b> shale had an inhibiting effect on CO production, consistent with {{the results from the}} programmed heating experiments...|$|R

The yield of AC from a triple mixture is lower than that from brown <b>coal</b> – <b>oil</b> slime, but {{higher than that of}} lignin – <b>oil</b> slime <b>mixtures.</b> The reached yield (15 - 20 %) and surface area (about 400 m 2 /g) of AC from triple mixture hydrolytic lignin – <b>oil</b> slime –brown <b>coal</b> are enough for their industrial using...|$|R

50|$|The {{availability}} of large seams of Cannel Coal, {{which could be}} used to produce a very desirable <b>coal</b> <b>oil,</b> brought investors to the region in the mid-19th century. The coal could be utilized to produce a <b>coal</b> <b>oil</b> which was in high demand in the urban areas of the US. The oil was used to replace whale oil for lighting. Cannel <b>Coal</b> <b>oil</b> burned bright and produced very little smoke. The utilization of the rivers for navigation was enhanced in the mid 1851 by the construction of a 34-mile lock and dam system designed by William Rosecrans. The Coal River Navigation Company was formed and invested approximately $208,000 to complete the system.|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between Chinese aggregate production and consumption of three main energy commodities: <b>coal,</b> <b>oil</b> and renewable energy. Both autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) and vector error correction modeling (VECM) show that Chinese growth is led by all three energy sources. Economic growth also causes <b>coal,</b> <b>oil</b> and renewables consumption, but with negative own-price effects for <b>coal</b> and <b>oil</b> and a strong possibility of fuel substitution through positive cross-price effects. The results further show coal consumption causing pollution, while renewable energy consumption reduces emissions. No significant causation on emissions is found for <b>oil.</b> Hence, making <b>coal</b> both absolutely and relatively expensive compared to oil and renewable energy encourages shifting from <b>coal</b> to <b>oil</b> and renewable energy, thereby improving economic and environmental sustainability...|$|R
