40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of chemical composition and isothermal heating {{in order to determine the}} change of the mechanical properties of the <b>metallic</b> <b>ribbons</b> by depth sensing indentation technique. Design/methodology/approach: The amorphous <b>metallic</b> <b>ribbons</b> were manufactured by planar-flow-casting method. Instrumented hardness measuring was carried out using the nanohardness tester DUH- 202 with a Vickers indenter. Observations of the structure of powders were made on the OPTON DSM- 940 scanning electron microscope. The diffraction examinations and examinations of thin foils were made on the JEOL JEM 3010 transmission electron microscope. Findings: The analysis of the mechanical properties and structure of the Co-based amorphous ribbons obtained in the by planar-flow-casting process proved that the no significant differences between both ternary alloys in local mechanical properties HM, EIT and W were observed for amorphous state but differences between ternary and multicomponent alloys were observed. In heat treated state small differences between materials were observed too. Research limitations/implications: For the <b>metallic</b> Co-based amorphous <b>ribbons,</b> further mechanical examinations and structure are planed. Practical implications: Feature an alternative to commercial alloys and composite materials are the amorphous and nanocrystalline metal amorphous ribbons obtained by melt spinning technique and make it possible to obtain the new composite materials with best mechanical properties, whose dimensions and shape can be freely formed.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the work}} is to {{investigate}} the changes of magnetic properties of the cobalt based Co 68 Fe 4 Mo 1 Si 13. 5 B 13. 5 alloy under cycling heating and cooling. Design/methodology/approach: The amorphous <b>metallic</b> <b>ribbons</b> were manufactured by planar-flow-casting method. Investigations of the magnetic properties were observed under permanent heating amorphous and partially crystallized alloy. Observations of the structure were made on the JOEL transmission electron microscope (TEM). Using the HFQS program the distributions of the magnetic hyperfine P(H) fields were determined for spectra smoothed in this way, employing the Hesse-Rübartsch method.
