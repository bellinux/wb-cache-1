500|$|For Diệm and his family, {{the failed}} coup {{was a turning}} point in {{relations}} with the US support, which had generally been unconditional and strong since 1955. He felt the US had let him down and that some Americans had been encouraging his overthrow and undermining his rule. He had previously though the Americans had full support for him, but afterwards, he told his confidants that he felt like Syngman Rhee, the President of the anti-communist South Korea who had been strongly backed by Washington until being deposed in a coup earlier in 1960, a regime change Diệm saw as US-backed. Diệm's opponents felt the same way about the similarities to Korea. Lieu later told Kahin [...] "We had no worry about getting continued American assistance if we were successful; we felt we could <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> just like Park did when he overthrew Rhee." [...] Kahin also wrote that several senior officers including a senior figure in the coup, whom he did not name, were [...] "explicit in charging American encouragement of the rebels".|$|E
500|$|Galvis {{opened the}} 2014 {{season with a}} health scare. During spring training, Galvis {{contracted}} a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (more commonly known as MRSA), ostensibly from the Phillies' clubhouse at Bright House Field in Clearwater, Florida. [...] "The team's most versatile and best defensive player", Galvis returned to the major league club on April 11. After he struggled early in the season, the Phillies optioned him to AAA on May 9 in favor of Reid Brignac. Two days later, he broke his clavicle, and spent two months on the disabled list. After a rehabilitation assignment, he performed well at AAA, and earned a call-up to the major leagues, replacing Brignac, whom the Phillies designated for assignment. Overall, Galvis posted his worst offensive season thus far; he hit [...]176 at the major league level with four home runs and 12 RBIs. After the season, Michael Baumann of Crashburn Alley wrote, [...] "After two years of medical and developmental setbacks, Galvis is still only entering his age-25 season, so it's possible the bat develops from bad to below-average and Galvis turns into something. I wouldn’t <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> but it's still {{within the realm of}} possibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Portnoy left Dream Theater, {{relationships}} {{between him and}} his former bandmates became strained. In February 2011, Portnoy complained that no one from the band was returning his calls and e-mails. However, later Portnoy commented that both Petrucci and Rudess were the only members that stayed in touch with him. Tensions became especially high when Portnoy called James LaBrie [...] "disrespectful" [...] for comments LaBrie made during an interview, stating that Dream Theater were [...] "not sad at all" [...] that Portnoy was no longer a band member. As of July 12, 2011, LaBrie has not remained in touch with Portnoy. At one point, false reports surfaced that Portnoy had sued Dream Theater. [...] Portnoy has since stated that he would rejoin the band in a heartbeat, stating: [...] "They are the ones that have closed the door on it. I’ve only needed a break, and I’ve had that break. So I’m ready, willing and able. But I honestly don’t think they ever will; they’ve closed their door on it and I think they’re too headstrong in having to prove themselves without me. So I wouldn’t <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> But my door is always open." ...|$|E

6000|$|What the Judge did was {{considered}} [...] "all right" [...] by his neighbors, {{for he was}} not only the best-born, but the richest man in town, and with a certain class these facts had great weight.

"He {{has turned}} in for his afternoon's nap, and will sleep {{for just one}} hour, blow high, or blow low," [...] said the mate, placing himself at Rose's side on the trunk, which formed the usual seat for those who could presume to take the liberty of sitting down on the quarter-deck.

60|$|When Lucy {{was allowed}} to write to her father, she set herself to cheer him. The thought that over five years must elapse before she would have him by her side once more, paralysed her pen; {{but she would not}} allow herself to be discouraged. And she sought to give courage to him. She wanted him to see that her love was undiminished, and that he could <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Presently she {{received}} a letter from him. After a few weeks, the unaccustomed food, the change of life, had told upon him; and a general breakdown in his health had driven him into the infirmary. Lucy was thankful for the respite which his illness afforded. It must be a little less dreary in a prison hospital than in a prison cell.|$|E

May he fondly feel that he can continue to <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>it?</b> Or, if you object to my question in that form, is it not, frankly, to making his attitude--after all so thoroughly public--more convenient to each of you that (without perhaps quite measuring what you're about,) you've gone on sacrificing poor Briss? I call it sacrificing, you see, in spite of there having been as yet no such great harm done. And {{if you ask me}} again what business of mine such inquiries may represent, why, the best thing will doubtless be to say to you that, with a smaller dose of irrepressible irony in my composition than you have in yours, I can't make so light as you of my tendency to worry on behalf of those I care for.

We cannot <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> We haven't it in hand. There may be some impasse. All we have surely is coal and oil,--there is no surplus of wood now--only an annual growth. And water-power is income also, doled out day by day. We cannot anticipate it. Coal and oil are our only capital. They are all we have for great important efforts. They are a gift to mankind to use to some supreme end or to waste in trivialities. Coal is the key to metallurgy and oil to transit. When they are done we shall either have built up such a fabric of apparatus, knowledge and social organization that we shall be able to manage without them--or we shall have travelled a long way down the slopes of waste towards extinction.... To-day, in getting, in distribution, in use we waste enormously....As we sit here all the world is wasting fuel fantastically." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet {{this little}} herb-like willow, {{one of the}} most northerly and hardy of European plants, is a true tree at heart none the less for all that. Soft and {{succulent}} as it looks in branch and leaf, you may yet <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> sometimes as many rings of annual growth as on a lordly Scotch fir-tree. But where? Why, underground. For see how cunning it is, this little stunted descendant of proud forest lords: hard-pressed by nature, it has learnt {{to make the best of}} its difficult and precarious position. It has a woody trunk at core, like all other trees; but this trunk never appears above the level of the soil: it creeps and roots underground in tortuous zigzags between the crags and boulders that lie strewn through its thin sheet of upland leaf-mould. By this simple plan the willow manages to get protection in winter, on the same principle as when we human gardeners lay down the stems of vines: only the willow remains laid down all the year and always. But in summer it sends up its short-lived herbaceous branches, covered with tiny green leaves, and ending at last in a single silky catkin. Yet between the great weeping willow and this last degraded mountain representative of the same primitive type, you can trace in Europe alone at least a dozen distinct intermediate forms, all well marked in their differences, and all progressively dwarfed by long stress of unfavourable conditions.|$|E
60|$|As for {{the beauty}} of women, {{it is like the}} light on the sea, never {{constant}} to a single wave. They all have it; they all lose it. Now she is dull and thick as bacon; now transparent as a hanging glass. The fixed faces are the dull ones. Here comes Lady Venice displayed like a monument for admiration, but carved in alabaster, to be set on the mantelpiece and never dusted. A dapper brunette complete from head to foot serves only as an illustration to lie upon the drawing-room table. The women in the streets have the faces of playing cards; the outlines accurately filled in with pink or yellow, and the line drawn tightly round them. Then, at a top-floor window, leaning out, looking down, you see beauty itself; or in the corner of an omnibus; or squatted in a ditch--beauty glowing, suddenly expressive, withdrawn the moment after. No one can <b>count</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> or seize it or have it wrapped in paper. Nothing is to be won from the shops, and Heaven knows {{it would be better to}} sit at home than haunt the plate-glass windows in the hope of lifting the shining green, the glowing ruby, out of them alive. Sea glass in a saucer loses its lustre no sooner than silks do. Thus if you talk of a beautiful woman you mean only something flying fast which for a second uses the eyes, lips, or cheeks of Fanny Elmer, for example, to glow through.|$|E
