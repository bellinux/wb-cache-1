40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} dynamic {{relation}} between callers' social ties and their wireless phone service consumption. We construct a large pair-level panel dataset {{with information on}} the number of each pair's <b>common</b> <b>contacts,</b> calling activities, prices, and each caller's characteristics over a one-year time period. We estimate a dynamic model that encapsulates the evolving relationship between each pair of consumers. We find the amount of communications between a pair of consumers increases with the strength of their tie, which is higher when these two consumers share more <b>common</b> <b>contacts.</b> Our results support the reciprocity rule in telephone calls, i. e. when individual A initiates more (less) phone calls to individual B in one month, their social tie will be strengthened (weakened) and individual B will make more (less) calls to individual A in the subsequent months. We demonstrate the implications of our results in evaluating the return of temporary price promotions and designing price plans. Our results underscore the importance of incorporating social network characteristics in the study of telecommunications markets. ...|$|R

50|$|These {{contacts}} {{are quite}} frequently found in electrical switches and relays as the <b>common</b> <b>contact</b> element provides a mechanically economical method {{of providing a}} higher contact count.|$|E
50|$|When the {{actuator}} is moved, {{mechanical energy}} {{is stored in}} the compression spring until the actuator passes its mid-position. At that time, the <b>common</b> <b>contact</b> bar is forced {{in the opposite direction}} by the compression spring, acting via the actuator bar, thus breaking the connection with the existing contact and making connection with the other contact. The <b>common</b> <b>contact</b> bar is made of copper, with an inlay of harder contact metal on the underside. While it is free to move the required distance lengthwise, it is constrained from moving sideways by the construction of the molded plastic body.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study that}} aims to answer two important questions related to targeted location-sharing privacy attacks: (1) given a group of users and their social graph, {{is it possible to}} predict which among them is likely to reveal most about their whereabouts, and (2) given a user, is it possible to predict which among her friends knows most about her whereabouts. To answer these questions we analyse the privacy policies of users of a realtime location sharing application, in which users actively shared their location with their contacts. The results show that users who are central to their network are more likely to reveal most about their whereabouts. Furthermore, we show that the friend most likely to know the whereabouts of a specific individual is the one with most <b>common</b> <b>contacts</b> and/or greatest number of contacts.

50|$|Gray {{codes are}} used in {{position}} encoders (linear encoders and rotary encoders), in preference to straightforward binary encoding. This avoids the possibility that, when several bits change in the binary representation of an angle, a misread will result {{from some of the}} bits changing before others. Originally, the code pattern was electrically conductive, supported (in a rotary encoder) by an insulating disk. Each track had its own stationary metal spring contact; one more contact made the connection to the pattern. That <b>common</b> <b>contact</b> was connected by the pattern to whichever of the track contacts were resting on the conductive pattern. However, sliding contacts wear out and need maintenance, so non-contact detectors, such as optical or magnetic sensors, are often used instead.|$|E

40|$|Background: Typical menopause-related {{symptoms}} sometimes mimic cardiovascular ill-nesses {{or other}} physical problems. It {{is essential to}} understand the help-seek-ing behaviors of menopausal women. Methods: A total of 181 subjects were recruited from our menopause-related mood clinic. A questionnaire which included patient data and help-seeking ques-tions was used. All help-seeking information was documented in chronologi-cal order up to register in the menopause-related mood clinic. Results: The average latency from the onset of menopausal symptoms to seeking evaluation at our specialty clinic was 16. 8 ± 27. 7 months. The first contact was a gynecologist (28. 2 %), general practitioner (15. 5 %), cardiologist (6. 1 %), and psychiatrist (6. 1 %). The most <b>common</b> <b>contacts</b> were gynecolo-gists (37. 0 %), followed by general practitioners (28. 2 %), psychiatrists (16. 0 %), and cardiologists (11. 6 %). Conclusions:Gynecologists, general practitioners, cardiologists, and general psychiatrists are all potential gatekeepers for menopausal women. It is important to increase the public’s understanding of menopause and improve cooperation between the various providers of women’s mental health to cut medical insurance costs and {{improve the quality of}} care...|$|R
40|$|Inaccuracies in {{computational}} molecular modeling {{methods are}} often counterweighed by brute-force generation of {{a plethora of}} putative solutions. These are then typically sieved via structural clustering based on similarity measures such as the {{root mean square deviation}} (RMSD) of atomic positions. Albeit widely used, these measures suffer from several theoretical and technical limitations (e. g., choice of regions for fitting) that impair their application in multicomponent systems (N > 2), large-scale studies (e. g., interactomes), and other time-critical scenarios. We present here a simple similarity measure for structural clustering based on atomic contacts [...] the fraction of <b>common</b> <b>contacts</b> [...] and compare it with the most used similarity measure of the protein docking community [...] interface backbone RMSD. We show that this method produces very compact clusters in remarkably short time when applied to a collection of binary and multicomponent protein-protein and protein-DNA complexes. Furthermore, it allows easy clustering of similar conformations of multicomponent symmetrical assemblies in which chain permutations can occur. Simple contact-based metrics should be applicable to other structural biology clustering problems, in particular for time-critical or large-scale endeavors...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of computing}} devices for social interactions propels the proliferation of online social applications, yet, it prompts a number of privacy concerns. One common problem occurs when two unfamiliar users, {{in the process of}} establishing social relationships, want to assess their social proximity by discovering mutual contacts. In this paper, we introduce Private Contact Discovery, a novel cryptographic primitive that lets two users, on input their respective contact lists, learn their <b>common</b> <b>contacts</b> (if any), and nothing else. We present an efficient and provably secure construction, that (i) prevents arbitrary list manipulation by means of contact certification, and (ii) guarantees user authentication and revocability. Following a rigorous cryptographic treatment of the problem, we define the privacy-protecting contact-hiding property and prove it for our solution, under the RSA assumption in the Random Oracle Model (ROM). We also show that other related cryptographic techniques, such as Private Set Intersection and Secret Handshakes, are unsuitable in this context. Experimental analysis attests to the practicality of our technique, which achieves computational and communication overhead (almost) linear in the number of contacts. ...|$|R
