50|$|The {{family of}} β-agonists {{includes}} β1-, β2-, and β3-agonists such as clenbuterol, ractopamine, <b>cimaterol,</b> zilpaterol and salbutamol. They possess similar chemical structures with different substituent {{groups on the}} phenyl ethanolamines. Due to their significant nutrition redistribution function, β-agonists have been applied in the livestock industry such as pigs and ruminants to reduce carcass fat and increase muscle mass while improving growth rate and feed conversion (Bareille and Faverdin, 1996, Bergen et al., 1989, Byrem et al., 1998, Cardoso and Taveira, 2002, Shook et al., 2009 and Williams et al., 1987). Unfortunately, β-agonists deposited in animal tissues can cause acute poisoning when consumed by humans, particularly in people with symptoms of muscular tremors, cardiac palpitation, nervousness, headache, muscular pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills (Brambilla et al., 2000). Therefore, the use of β-agonists in animal feeds has been banned in many countries such as the EU and China (Mitchell and Dunnavan, 1998 and Prezelj et al., 2003). There are still illicit usages of β-agonists in animal feeds in many countries.|$|E
40|$|Several beta-adrenergic {{receptor}} (bAR) agonists {{are known}} to cause hypertrophy of skeletal muscle tissue. Accordingly, five bAR agonists encompassing a range in activity from strong to weak were evaluated {{for their ability to}} stimulate cAMP accumulation in embryonic chicken skeletal muscle cells in culture. Two strong agonists (epinephrine and isoproterenol), one moderate agonist (albuterol), and two weak agonists known to cause hypertrophy in animals (clenbuterol and <b>cimaterol)</b> were studied. Dose response curves were determined over six orders of magnitude in concentration for each agonist, and values were determined for their maximum stimulation of cAMP synthesis rate (Bmax) and the agonist concentration at which 50 % stimulation of cAMP synthesis (EC 50) occurred. Bmax values decreased in the following order: isoproterenol, epinephrine, albuterol, <b>cimaterol,</b> clenbuterol. <b>Cimaterol</b> and clenbuterol at their Bmax concentrations were approximately 15 -fold weaker than isoproterenol in stimulating the rate of cAMP synthesis. When <b>cimaterol</b> and clenbuterol were added to culture media at concentrations known to cause significant muscle hypertrophy in animals, there was no detectable effect on stimulation of cAMP synthesis. Finally, these same levels of <b>cimaterol</b> and clenbuterol did not antagonize the stimulation of cAMP by either epinephrine or isoproterenol...|$|E
40|$|Recently, beta-adrenergic agents, which {{repartition}} {{muscle and}} fat, {{have been used}} to develop more muscular carcasses in broilers, steers, lambs, and pigs. <b>Cimaterol,</b> one such repartitioning agent, effectively improves carcass quality in pigs. Since the mode of action of repartitioning agents is uncertain, and because they may indirectly affect skeletal development or the integrity of feet, {{the purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of <b>cimaterol</b> on selected growth cartilages and feet. Pigs were randomly placed in four groups and fed a ration that included <b>Cimaterol</b> at 0. 00, 0. 25, 0. 50, or 1. 00 mg/kg. At 100 kg live-weight, pigs were slaughtered and selected growth cartilages, bones, and feet were examined macroscopically, radiologically, and microscopically.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which β-agonists induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy is believed largely to be through a reduction in protein degradation. These growth promoters are also known to effect {{the activity of the}} calcium dependent proteinases (calpains) and their specific endogenous inhibitor calpastatin. The changes in activity appear to be toward a decrease in the calpain system's proteolytic potential. In this study attempts were made to determine whether the altered activity of the enzymes and inhibitor were brought about by induced changes in gene expression as reflected by altered levels of specific mRNAs. Various strategies were employed to generate oligonucleotide and cDNA probes to calpain I and II and calpastatin which would detect their respective mRNAs in L. dorsi total RNA samples originating from a bovine growth trial using the ß-agonist <b>cimaterol.</b> Semi-quantiative measurements of specific mRNAs using Northern blot analysis were related to enzyme and inhibitor activities. In addition ß-agonist-mediated effects on muscle RNA and expression of actin and myosin light chain 2 mRNAs were determined. Using a human calpain cDNA specific hybridization was detected for bovine calpain II mRNA which increased by 34 % in the L. dorsi of <b>cimaterol</b> treated animals, similar to the increase in the enzyme activity, 28 %. A novel bovine-specific calpastatin cDNA was generated by the polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis allowed comparison to those already published for other species. Using this PCR cDNA as a probe multiple calpastatin mRNAs were detected in cattle L. dorsi, as had been observed in rabbit. The predominant mRNA increased by 160 % in <b>cimaterol</b> treated steers compared to a 76 % change in inhibitor activity. There changes were in contrast to the essentially unchanged response of muscle total RNA and actin and myosin light chain 2 specific mRNAs in treated animals.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of long-term feeding of a beta agonist (<b>cimaterol)</b> on female Japanese quail. Quail used were from lines selected for high (HD) and low (LD) body density from a randombred population. Dietary treatments consisted of 1) the basal feed, 2) the basal feed containing. 5 ppm, or 3) 1. 0 ppm of the beta agonist. The treatment period for the six experimental groups extended from 14 to 94 days of age. Weight gains to 49 days and live weights at 94 days of age were greater (P<. 05) in the cimaterol-fed groups. Age and live weight at first egg in both lines were greater (P<. 01) when groups were fed treated diets.

40|$|There is {{too much}} fat on beef {{carcasses}} today. Research in beef cattle production is directed towards solving this problem by maximizing partitioning of dietary nutrients to lean muscle growth and minimizing deposition of carcass fat. Partitioning agents called β - adrenergic agonists are able to cause this type of nutrient partitioning. Earlier work showed two of these compounds, clenbuterol and <b>cimaterol,</b> can be fed and are effective in many species including pigs, sheep, and cattle. At levels that did not depress gain, clenbuterol feeding increased protein content of the 9 th to 11 th rib section by 13 % and decreased fat content by 20 % in cattle. Even more dramatic carcass changes were observed in cattle in response to <b>cimaterol.</b> Of interest are the underlying metabolic changes and controls that must be altered {{to bring about the}} carcass changes previously cited.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} feeding a beta agonist, <b>cimaterol,</b> on carcass yield and {{composition}} and adipose tissue development was studied in female broilers. <b>Cimaterol</b> was provided at. 25 ppm in the feed starting at 4 wk of age. Birds were sacrificed at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 wk for determination of eviscerated carcass yield, carcass composition, and growth and cellularity of the abdominal, neck, back, and sartorial adipose depots. Carcass yield was significantly (P<. 01) greater in treated birds than in controls (70. 0 vs. 72. 8 %) at 10 wk of age. Moisture percentage and protein decreased (P<. 05) less rapidly in treated carcasses than in control carcasses with increasing age.

40|$|Whether {{occurring}} naturally or synthetically, beta-agonists {{are classified}} as phenethanolamines based on their chemical structure. Other specificities of structure determine the exact behavior of the compound in animals. Beta-agonists bind to specific receptors on the cell membranes of skeletal muscle, adipose,and other tissues. Upon binding, these agents alter metabolic pathways, ultimately causing a repartitioning of nutrients to increase muscle and decrease fat accretion.

40|$|The β 1 -adrenoceptor {{exists in}} two agonist conformations/states: 1) a high-affinity state where {{responses}} to catecholamines and other agonists (e. g., <b>cimaterol)</b> are potently inhibited by β 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists, and 2) a low-affinity secondary conformation where agonist responses, particularly CGP 12177 [(−) - 4 -(3 -tert-butylamino- 2 -hydroxypropoxy) -benzimidazol- 2 -one] are relatively resistant to inhibition by β 1 -adrenoceptor antagonists. Although both {{states have been}} demonstrated in many species (including human), the precise nature of the secondary state is unknown and does not occur in the closely related β 2 -adrenoceptor. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis and functional measurements of production of a cyclic AMP response element upstream of a secreted placental alkaline phosphatase reporter gene and accumulation of 3 H-cAMP, we examined the pharmacological consequences of swapping transmembrane (TM) regions of the human β 1 - and β 2 -adrenoceptors, followed by single point mutations, to determine the key residues involved in the β 1 -adrenoceptor secondary conformation. We found that TM 4 (particularly amino acids L 195 and W 199) had {{a major role in}} the generation of the secondary β 1 -adrenoceptor conformation. Thus, unlike at the human β 1 -wild-type adrenoceptor, at β 1 -TM 4 mutant receptors, <b>cimaterol</b> and CGP 12177 responses were both potently inhibited by antagonists. CGP 12177 acted as a simple partial agonist with similar KB and EC 50 values in the β 1 -TM 4 but not β 1 -wild-type receptors. Furthermore pindolol switched from a biphasic concentration response at human β 1 -wild-type adrenoceptors to a monophasic concentration response in the β 1 -TM 4 mutant receptors. Mutation of these amino acids to those found in the β 2 -adrenoceptor (L 195 Q and W 199 Y), or mutation of a single residue (W 199 D) in the human β 1 -adrenoceptor thus abolished this secondary conformation and created a β 1 -adrenoceptor with only one high-affinity agonist conformation...|$|E

For Treatments 1 through 6, bids were fed a control diet or a diet containing 1 ppm CIM until slaughter at 35, 42, or 49 d of age. Treatments 7 and 8 consisted of birds fed the CIM diet for 14 d and then withdrawn from CIM for either 7 or 14 d before slaughter (42 or 49 d of age). In Treatment 9, birds were fed the CIM diet to 42 d of age, then withdrawn from CIM for 7 d. Breast muscle (BM) weight, leg muscle (LM) weight, whole body weight, and BM and LM cathepsin B and L activities were obtained on 12 birds/treatment. Body, LM and BM composition and BM shear values were obtained on 12 additional birds/treatment. Eight birds/treatment were used to balance the number of birds per pen. Leg muscle weight, as a percentage of whole body weight, was elevated in CIM-fed birds at all ages, and BM percentage was greater at 35 d of age (P M. 05). Leg muscle fat percentage was reduced at 35 and 42 d of age (P 3 ̆c. 05), and LM protein was elevated at 42 and 49 d of age (P 3 ̆c. 05) in CIM-fed birds.

The pigs and sheep responded similarly to EPI, with decreased rates of leucine entry (proteolysis in the pigs, and proteolysis and absorption of amino acids in the sheep) and protein synthesis. EPI infusion in the sheep also resulted in increases in leucine and KIC interconversion. NOR infusion produced decreases in the rates of proteolysis, protein synthesis, leucine and KIC interconversion, and KIC oxidation in the pigs, but had no significant effect on protein metabolism in the sheep. Acute infusions of CIM in the sheep resulted in decreases in the rates of leucine entry, protein synthesis and reamination of KIC to leucine. Glucose concentrations rose during all infusions, while free fatty acid (FFA) levels were elevated during NOR infusion in both species and during EPI infusion in the sheep. Insulin concentrations increased during the infusion of all adrenergic agents in sheep, but did not change in the pigs. Plasma glucagon concentrations increased during the EPI infusion in the sheep and the NOR infusion in the pigs, but decreased during the CIM infusion. Cortisol concentrations rose during NOR infusion in both species, but were unaffected by the other treatments. Despite a general increase in insulin to glucagon ratios with catechol infusion, whole-body protein anabolism was not evident in these acute studies. Differences may exist, however, in individual tissues which may change the distribution of body proteins. The changes in metabolite concentrations in the plasma indicate that acute infusions of these compounds increase the supply of readily available energy in the plasma.

40|$|Beta-adrenoceptors {{belong to}} the {{superfamily}} of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and remain an important target for drug discovery. The complexity of GPCR pharmacology {{in terms of its}} signaling profile has led to a desire to further the study of receptor-ligand interaction and obtain more detailed information regarding ligand affinity and efficacy. Development of selective fluorescent ligands targeted at human β 1 and β 2 –adrenoceptors may facilitate drug discovery programs in terms of understanding receptor pharmacology and receptor localisation in both recombinant and primary cells from healthy and diseased tissue. Fluorescent ligands are usually designed and synthesized by tethering the ligand to a fluorophore via a linker to form a conjugate. This thesis reports the synthesis of a series of novel dipeptide-linked congeners which, when coupled to commercially available fluorophore active esters (BODIPY-X- 630 / 650 or BODIPY–FL), afford a series of seventeen red- and green-emitting dipeptide-linked fluorescent ligands for human β 1 and β 2 –adrenoceptors. Pharmacological characterization of the dipeptide-linked fluorescent ligands was achieved using the NanoBRET assay, a novel proximity-based assay. The most promising synthesised compounds propranolol-Gly-Ala FL and propranolol-Gly-Ser-FL (both nanomolar range KD), showed a respective 87 -fold and 26 -fold selectivity for the β 2 –adrenoceptor versus the β 1 –adrenoceptor [pKD = 8. 59 ± 0. 11 and 7. 74 ± 0. 03 (β 2); 6. 65 ± 0. 09 and 6. 32 ± 0. 20 (β 1) ]. Additionally, these compounds were used in a NanoBRET displacement binding experiment as tracer ligands, with known unlabelled compounds (such as CGP 20712 a, <b>cimaterol,</b> propranolol (hydrochloride) and ICI 118551) and newly-synthesised acetylated ligands at the Nluc β 2 AR in order to determine their KD in this system. The displacement binding data agreed with literature values obtained by whole-cell binding assay in both CHO-K 1 and Nluc HEK cells. Furthermore, [3 H]-CGP 12177 whole-cell binding experiments were conducted in Nluc HEK 293 and CHO-K 1 β 1 and β 2 -AR and the results show good correlation with the NanoBRET saturation data and data obtained from another assay, the CRE-SPAP reporter gene assay. In cells expressing β 2 -AR, confocal microscopy studies revealed specific membrane labelling with selected ligands which was inhibited by propranolol and ICI 118551.

Trial 1 consisted of 55, 31 -d-old broiler chickens individually fed for up to 48 h. At 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h, five CON and five CIM-fed chickens were killed. Trial 2 consisted of 160, 33 -d-old broiler chickens group-fed for up to 14 d. At 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 d, 10 CON and 10 CIM-fed chickens were killed. The breast muscle (BM) and leg muscle (LM) weight, cathepsin B and L activities, DNA, RNA, and protein concentration, and BM shear force value (SFV) were measured in both trials. Thigh muscle (TM) SFV were measured in Trial 2 only. Fiber size of BM was measured (five birds per treatment) at d 2, 6, 10, and 14. In Trial 1, BM weight and SFV were lower in CIM-fed birds at 6 h (P 3 ̆c, 051. In Trial 2 BM SFV were higher at d 8 (P =, 061 and d 10 (P c. 05) in CIM-fed chickens. The SFV of CIM-fed chickens were higher at d 4, 8, lo, 12, and 14 (P 3 ̆c. 051. The BM of CIM-fed chickens had a higher protein:DNA ratio (P 3 ̆c. 05) at d 6 through 14, whereas LM of CIM-fed chickens had a higher protein:DNA ratio at d 8, 10, and 14. Fiber size of the BM in CIM-fed chickens tended to be larger at d 10 (P =. 13) and at d 14 (P =, 17).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the mechanisms that mediate the effects of beta-adrenergic agonists (BA) and Growth Hormone (GH) in sheep, by examining the changes in skeletal muscle transcriptome and blood metabolome in order to identify the predominant metabolic mechanisms by which muscle hypertrophy was mediated. Male lambs (120 days old) were all fed a high protein/energy feed ad-libitum, with the GH group (n= 10) receiving a single subcutaneous injection of bovine GH (3. 75 mg/kg body weight, POSILAC, Monsanto) on day 1; the BA group (n= 10) receiving BA (<b>cimaterol)</b> at 10 mg/kg feed, whereas the control group (CO, n= 11) only had the ad-libitum feed. After 6 days sheep were slaughtered, plasma and samples of the Longissimus dorsi (LD), Supraspinatus (SS) muscles and liver were collected. The effect of treatments on the LD transcriptome was assessed on a subset of samples (n= 3 from each treatment) via a cross-species approach using the Affymetrix Human U 133 + 2 GeneChip array (47 K human microarray). Verification of identified differentially expressed genes and proteins was by quantitative RT-PCR or western blotting, respectively, on all animals. Metabolomics analysis of plasma samples was carried out by Metabolon Inc. (USA) using GC/MS and LC/MS/MS platforms. BA, but not GH, significantly (P< 0. 05) increased muscle weights and this was associated transition to large fast-glycolytic muscle fibre types. In GH, but not BA treated animals, there was an increase in liver weights (P< 0. 001). This was associated with an increase in the whole liver content of glycogen (P< 0. 001), protein (P< 0. 01), and lipid (P< 0. 05) content. Analysis of the LD transcriptome of the treated sheep identified 477 and 316 transcripts were significantly altered (P< 0. 05 and 1. 5 fold change) by BA and GH respectively, relative to controls. This muscle was selected as it is a commercial valuable muscle and is commonly used for muscle biochemical studies therefore this would allow us to make comparisons to other studies, including our own. In addition it is a fast glycolytic muscle fibre type there could be compared against SS muscle (oxidative muscle fibre type). BA decreased the expression of genes involved with oxidative phosphorylation and upregulated those serine biosynthetic pathways. Subsequent qRT-PCR analysis showed a BA induced increase in expression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) (P< 0. 05) and phosphoserine-aminotransferase (PSAT) (P< 0. 05) mRNA in both LD and SS but not liver. In LD there was also an increase (P< 0. 001) in PHGDH protein in muscle from BA treated sheep relative to GH treated sheep. Up-regulation of this pathway has been previously reported in cancer cells which has a tendency to be associated with an increase in gene expression of a specific isoform of the glycolysis enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM 2) which has reduced activity. Total PKM and PKM 1 and PKM 2 isoforms were increased in the SS and LD of BA treated sheep (P< 0. 05). Previous studies in cancer cells have suggested that increases in serine synthesis are mediated by changes in PKM 2 expression and associated enzyme activity. The lack of a differential increase in PKM 2 suggested that the regulation of muscle PK in BA treated animals was not critical to the potential increase in serine synthesis capacity. No clear change in PKM gene expression suggested this was not the mechanism by which the serine synthesis pathway was stimulated. There was an increase (P< 0. 05) in the expression the mitochondrial form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK 2) in the LD of BA treated sheep, which might be expected to increase gluconeogenic potential thereby increasing intermediates {{that could be used for}} serine synthesis. There was no effect of this gene on sheep treated with GH. An increase in the gene expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) was also seen in the muscles of BA but not GH treated sheep (P< 0. 001) and there was no effect on their livers, which further suggested that BA was influencing the production of nonessential amino acids. Metabolomics analysis showed that products of triacylglycerol breakdown, glycerol and free fatty acids, were all elevated in the plasma of both BA and GH treatments, indicating lipolytic effects but the increase in the free fatty acid profile were more pronounced with GH treatment (P< 0. 05). Likewise GH rather than BA had a greater impact on elevating plasma glucose and associated metabolites such as pyruvate (P< 0. 05). There was no effect of either treatment on plasma serine or asparagine concentrations. However there was a decrease in glycine (P< 0. 05) and glutamine (P< 0. 05) in GH relative to control, with BA decreasing histidine (P< 0. 05) and methionine (P< 0. 01) relative to control. Cell culture experiments were carried out in the myogenic C 2 C 12 cell line to determine if the genes associated with the GH and BA response in sheep were affected during myogenesis and whether there was an effect of des (1 - 3) IGF-I and dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) that stimulates GH and BA signalling pathways respectively. During differentiation, without treatment, gene expression of PHGDH and PSAT enzymes declined (P< 0. 05), which might be expected as cells move from a proliferative to a terminally differentiate state. There was no clear effect of treatment on genes associated with the serine synthesis pathway suggesting that the effects of BA, in particular, are on muscle fibres rather than differentiating cells. Of the two growth promoters examined in this thesis BA appears to be the most potent in skeletal muscle. A clear effect of this agent was an increase in the gene expression of the serine biosynthetic pathway, which has been shown to be upregulated in various cancers and, in this pathology, is thought to be a novel mechanism for hyperplastic growth. The associated changes in the expression of genes such as ASNS and PCK 2 indicate that their co-ordinated upregulation could be mediated via endoplasmic reticulum stress response mechanisms. Unlike GH, BA does not appear to have a major effect upon the systemic mobilisation of nutrients, but instead seems to targets muscle fibres, activating muscle biosynthetic pathways that potentially provide the substrates required for growth...|$|E
