By functionalizing two hole-transporting groups, dipyridylamine and anthracene, on the silole ring, we {{have investigated the}} influence of both substituents on the hole current.

40|$|This paper reports {{quantitative}} {{correlation of}} CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 (MAPbBr(3)) thin film morphology to {{light emitting diode}} efficiency parameters. Sequential (spin coating) deposition is used for highly reproducible and dense film morphology of MAPbBr(3) thin-film. In this fabrication process using an orthogonal solvent approach, control of morphology, coverage, thickness, and optical properties in these compact thin-films is demonstrated. Optical studies show direct correlation between morphology to dynamics of photoluminescence (PL) and absolute PL yield. Perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are fabricated from these films {{to find the best}} ratio of PbBr 2 versus MABr for optimal performance. This study demonstrates PeLEDs with high brightness, approximate to 1050 cd m(- 2) at 4. 7 V (luminance efficiency approximate to 0. 1 cd A(- 1)), for optimal thin-film process with state-of-the-art device performance. This quantitative analysis suggests that these state-of-the-art PeLEDs suffer from poor charge <b>carrier</b> <b>balance</b> (approximate to 2 %) and out-coupling efficiency (approximate to 6 %).

Intense optimization of the crystalline quality causes a squarely-increasing MR, as interpreted by perfect compensation of opposite carriers.

The LMR further intensifies and predominates at fields higher than 20 Tesla while the parabolic MR gradually decays. The LMR remains unsaturated up to a high field of 60 Tesla and persists, even at a high pressure of 6. 2 GPa.

By using a combined {{approach of the}} addition of MoO 3, as a bottom hole-injection layer, and the incorporation of such thick active layers, exceptionally high performance metrics are achieved. In particular, brightnesses of 1000 cd/m 2 at driving voltages of only 6. 8 V, corresponding to a power efficiency of 7. 8 lm/W, a current efficiency of 17. 2 cd/A, and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5. 6 %, are reported for devices based on F 8 BT (Poly[(9, 9 -di-n-octylfluorenyl- 2, 7 -diyl) -alt-(benzo[2, 1, 3]thiadiazol- 4, 8 -diyl) ]). A side-by-side comparison, between the standard LED structure and hybrid structures, demonstrates that with MoO 3 as bottom hole-injection layer, the electron and hole charge carriers are both giving space charge limited current for both carriers due to the Ohmic contacts. The devices hence show improved charge <b>carrier</b> <b>balance,</b> and, most importantly, high brightness at low operational voltage.

A superior device performance with high current and power efficiencies of 47. 4 cd/A and 37. 3 lm/W, respectively, and more importantly, a theoretical maximum of external quantum efficiency of 21. 9 %, can be achieved for an optimized TCTA-doped device.

40|$|The {{invention}} of the electrical generation of light 150 years ago by Thomas Swan changed the world fundamentally. Before, the circadian rhythm {{was determined by the}} natural light of the sun. All of a sudden, it became possible to bring light into the darkness without being dependent on the weak light of candles or paraffin lamps. Ever since, electrical light sources {{play a crucial role in}} modern society. In the early 20 th century, the technology of fluorescent tubes was introduced in addition to incandescent bulbs. However, until today both these light sources comprise several disadvantages. The most fundamental deficiency of incandescent bulbs surely is their very low efficiency of about 15 lm/W, which results in a high amount of lost heat. Furthermore, their lifetime is limited to 1000 - 2000 hours. Due to this, they have to be replaced frequently and also can pose a safety risk if they are employed in traffic lights, for example. Fluorescent lights, however, offer a high efficiency of about 90 lm/W. Nevertheless, the unfavorable design limits their popularity especially in the private environment. Another disadvantage is the fact that fluorescent tubes mostly contain mercury, which leads to environmental problems if they brake or are improperly disposed. A universal light source has to fulfill a couple of requirements for different applications. The brightness and chromaticity should be tunable by the manufacturer and in addition to this, it should offer maximum flexibility in regard to the design. Furthermore, a high efficiency in order to save energy and minimize the heat loss is required for almost every application. Obviously, all these requirements together cannot be fulfilled by fluorescent tubes, energy saving lamps and even less by incandescent bulbs. A solution to this problem is the physical effect of electroluminescence (EL), which is the direct conversion of current to light. This concept is applied in light emitting diodes (LED). Especially organic LED (OLED) offer the potential to achieve all requirements of a universal light source as described above. In regard to lighting, OLED have tremendous advantages: They are thin, lightweight and generate a diffusive light which does not create sharp transitions from bright to dark areas. These properties do not only render OLED as promising candidates for general lighting, but also for applications such as signage, decorative lighting or automotive interior lighting. In theory, OLED can be manufactured in arbitrary shapes. In combination with a multitude of possible colors or even the dynamic tuning of the emission color, they are ideal solutions for advertising applications. Last but not least, OLED possess an enormous energy saving potential. It is generally acknowledged that OLED, in principle, have the capability to exceed the efficiencies of modern fluorescent tubes. This would result in a more economic consumption of energy and thus, direct benefit for the environment. During the manufacturing process, no heavy metals are required and the glass or plastic foil which is used as a substrate can be fully recycled. Therefore, OLED are promising candidates to substitute conventional light sources in many areas of application. Nevertheless, some challenges have to be mastered before OLED are ready for the introduction into the market. Many research groups worldwide are working on the improvement of OLED efficiencies, especially for white emitting devices. Other important aspects for OLED are their reliability and lifetime. These can be advanced by optimizing the charge <b>carrier</b> <b>balance</b> in the devices, the development of novel organic materials or the improvement of encapsulation technologies. In regard to the conception of pre-pilot systems for the manufacturing of devices on an industrial scale, the evaluation of different deposition technologies is a fundamental matter. In this work, the technology of organic vapor phase deposition (OVPD), which was invented by Prof. S. Forrest at Princeton University, is investigated. Monochrome and white emitting devices as well as organic single layers were fabricated. Due to the fact that OVPD is a relatively young technology compared to the established vacuum thermal evaporation (VTE), a primary goal of this work was to generate an understanding in regard to the impact of various process parameters on the performance of OLED. While for VTE systems, the tunable process parameters are mostly limited to the deposition rate, OVPD offers several precisely adjustable parameters such as deposition chamber pressure, substrate temperature and carrier gas flow. As of today, the influence of these variables on the organic thin films and devices is vastly unknown. The impact of various parameters during the gas phase deposition process was investigated in this work and in addition to this, crucial technological aspects for OVPD systems were identified...|$|E

40|$|Organic {{light-emitting}} diodes are promising new light sources for both general lighting and display technologies. Although first commercial products are already available, {{the efficiency and}} the long-term stability during electrical operation are not really satisfying, yet. Thus, {{there is still much}} room for improvement of both factors influencing future applications based on OLEDs. The motivation of this thesis was the better understanding of the photo-physical processes inside complex OLED structures. Especially the influence of cavity effects on the efficiency of the devices and a detailed analysis of energy dissipation to the optical modes of an OLED was in the focus of the first part, resulting in a comprehensive efficiency analysis of state-of-the-art devices. Additionally, the degradation induced changes of the photo-physical properties of the emitting molecules have been less investigated in the past. Hence, the second part of this thesis deals with this topic because a better understanding of degradation effects, especially their influence on the emitting guest/host systems, can lead to an enormous increase of lifetimes in terms of long-term stability and a deeper physical understanding. However, the external quantum efficiency of organic {{light-emitting diodes}} is determined by four different factors, namely the charge <b>carrier</b> <b>balance,</b> the radiative exciton fraction, the effective radiative quantum efficiency of the emitting system and the outcoupling factor of the device. The first factor is mainly influenced by electrical properties of the used organic layers such as charge carrier mobility and injection barriers between them. The radiative exciton fraction is caused by quantum mechanical selection rules and is unity for phosphorescent emitting systems, while it can be significantly less for fluorescent emitters. However, only the determination of all four factors of the EQE would lead to a consistent comprehensive efficiency analysis of state-of-the-art OLEDs, which was one aim of this thesis. Therefore, the main focus was on developing and evaluating an approach to determine the radiative quantum efficiency of an emitting guest/host system inside a complex OLED structure, because measurements of isolated thin films in integrating spheres can lead to a wrong estimation of this important factor. Thus, a method based on a subsequent variation of the cavity strength, mainly formed by the typically used metallic cathode of an OLED, at the position of the emission zone was investigated by using simplified structures. Thereby, changes of the cavity strength were achieved by a variation of the distance of the emission layer to a highly reflecting silver layer which was obtained by a variable optical spacer thickness between both layers. Therewith, the interference effects and the power dissipation between the different optical modes of this system are changed, which is known as Purcell effect. Thus, the radiative rate of the emitting molecules is modified while the non-radiative rate remains unchanged. The corresponding excited states lifetime of the emitting molecules inside the cavity is hence changed with the optical spacer thickness. Using time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and comparing the extracted excited states lifetimes to numerical simulations leads to a determination of the radiative quantum efficiency of the emitting system under investigation. The second part of this thesis focused on the analysis of degradation processes by means of electrical aging of the devices. First, a new sample structure exhibiting low latency has been developed. With this new structure it was possible to investigate the changes of the excited states lifetime during electrical aging via time-resolved electroluminescence spectroscopy. This method is much closer to the real processes arising during electrical operation than probing the whole emission layer with an optical excitation. The decrease of the excited states lifetime of the emitting system can be correlated with the drop in luminance during electrical aging. Thus, the common assumption of an unchanged radiative rate while the non-radiative rate is increased due to electrical operation was proved for the emitting system Ir(ppy) 3 :CBP. Additionally, the decrease of the excited states lifetime and the corresponding radiative quantum efficiency of the emitting system was identified to be the main reason for the drop in luminance although strong changes in the electrical characteristics have been detectable via IVL measurements and impedance spectroscopy. Finally, the presented approach for efficiency analysis of OLEDs was then used for analyzing degradation effects in state-of-the-art devices. Therefore, the efficiency analysis was performed via EQE measurements and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy before and after an accelerated degradation process. Therewith, it was possible to explain the electrical aging induced drop in luminance exclusively by a decrease of the radiative quantum efficiency of the emitting system Ir(MDQ) 2 (acac) :alpha-NPD, while the other three factors determining the external quantum efficiency of an OLED remained constant. It should be noted, that a possible deviation of the emitter orientation due to the electrical degradation has been included in the analysis. Additionally, the calculation of the radiative and the non-radiative rates of the emitting species for the pristine state and after degradation disproved the assumption of an unchanged radiative rate due to electrical aging. It was found, that both rates are modified by the degradation process, the non-radiative rate is increased while the radiative rate is reduced. In order to explain theses unexpected changes, two different degradation mechanisms, namely aging of the matrix and of the emitting molecules, have been assumed and partial evidence has been achieved. Organische Leuchtdioden (OLEDs) sind verheißungsvolle neue Lichtquellen sowohl für den allgemeinen Beleuchtungssektor, als auch für Displayanwendungen. Obwohl einige kommerzielle Produkte bereits auf dem Markt angeboten werden, sind Langzeitstabilität und Effizienz dieser Produkte noch nicht zufriedenstellend und müssen weiterhin verbessert werden. Essentiell für eine Steigerung der beiden genannten Kenngrößen, ist die genaue Analyse der Energiedissipation der angeregten organischen Moleküle in die verschiedenen optischen Moden einer OLED. Dazu präsentiert diese Dissertation eine Methodik, die es erlaubt, alle wichtigen Kenngrößen der Effizienz einer OLED mittels Messungen der externen Quanteneffizienz der Bauteile, in Kombination mit optischer Kurzzeitspektroskopie, zu bestimmen. Diese Methodik basiert auf einer systematischen Variation des Abstandes des emittierenden Systems zu einer hochreflektierenden Schicht. Durch den sogenannten Purcell Effekt wird dadurch sowohl die effektive Effizienz des emittierenden Systems (und damit dessen Emissionslebensdauer), als auch die Verteilung der Energie innerhalb den optischen Moden der OLED variiert. Durch den Vergleich von Simulationen mit Messergebnissen lässt sich dann auf die einzelnen Größen, die die externe Quanteneffizienz von OLEDs bestimmen, schließen.

These nanoparticles with N/P ratio of 30 give high transfection efficiency 2. 12 × 104 [*]RLU/μg protein and cell viability (86. 4 %). These modified GA-PEI nanoparticles, with high transfection efficiency and low cell toxicity, can be a potential gene vector in gene therapy...|$|R
50|$|In the Armstrong method, {{the audio}} signal {{and the radio}} {{frequency}} carrier signal are applied to the balanced modulator to generate a double sideband suppressed carrier signal. The phase of this output signal is then shifted 90 degrees {{with respect to the}} original <b>carrier.</b> The <b>balanced</b> modulator output can either lead or lag the carrier's phase. The double sideband signal and the original carrier signal are then applied to the mixer, and the original carrier—90 degrees out of phase—is reinserted. The output from the mixer is a frequency modulated signal.|$|R
40|$|The {{inverted}} polymer {{solar cells}} (PSCs) with pentacene-doped P 3 HT[*]:[*]PCBM absorption layers were fabricated. It was {{demonstrated that the}} pentacene doping modulated the electron mobility and the hole mobility in the resulting absorption layer. Furthermore, by varying the doping content, the optimal <b>carrier</b> mobility <b>balance</b> could be obtained. In addition, the pentacene doping led to an improvement in the crystallinity of the resulting films and made an enhancement in the light absorption, which was {{partly responsible for the}} performance improvement of the solar cells. Using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, it was determined that the <b>balanced</b> <b>carrier</b> mobility (μh/μe= 1. 000) was nearly achieved when a pentacene doping ratio of 0. 065 by weight was doped into the P 3 HT[*]:[*]PCBM[*]:[*]pentacene absorption layer. Compared with the inverted PSCs without the pentacene doping, the short circuit current density and the power conversion efficiency of the inverted PSCs with the pentacene doping ratio of 0. 065 were increased from 9. 73 [*]mA/cm 2 to 11. 26 [*]mA/cm 2 and from 3. 39 % to 4. 31 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A newborn male infant with {{multiple}} congenital abnormalities {{was found to}} be trisomic for 3 p 23 [...] pter and monosomic for 11 q 23 [...] qter. His parents were both <b>carriers</b> of a <b>balanced</b> reciprocal translocation. Considerable overlap in phenotype-karyotype correlations was found between the two chromosomal syndromes in the patient...|$|R
40|$|A gene (or gene cluster) {{controlling}} 1 (or more) cell surface species antigens {{has been}} assigned to chromosome 11. Using hybrids made with cells from a <b>carrier</b> of a <b>balanced</b> reciprocal translocation, 45,XX,t(11; 17) (p 15;q 21), the authors have localized this gene or genes to the short arm of chromosome 11...|$|R
