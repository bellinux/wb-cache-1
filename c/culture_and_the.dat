5|$|The final {{process of}} the {{differentiation}} of the cultures recognized as early Slavic, the Kolochin culture] (over {{the territory of the}} Kiev culture), the Penkovka <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Prague-Korchak culture, took place during the end of the 4th and in the 5th century CE. Beyond the Post-Zarubintsy horizon, the expanding early Slavs took over much of the territories of the Chernyakhov <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Dacian Carpathian Tumuli culture. As not all of the previous inhabitants from those cultures had left the area, they probably contributed some elements to the Slavic cultures.|$|E

5|$|Because of its {{geographic}} position, Croatia {{represents a}} blend of four different cultural spheres. It has been a crossroad of influences of the western <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> east—ever since division of the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire—as {{well as of the}} Mitteleuropa and the Mediterranean culture. The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history, as the 19th-century period proved crucial in emancipation of the Croatian language and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of art and culture, giving rise to a number of historical figures.|$|E

In writing them, Tricky drew on his experiences in the British drug <b>culture</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> influence of his deceased mother Maxine Quaye, after whom the album is titled.|$|E

5|$|More recently, Andrée's heroic motives {{have been}} questioned, {{beginning}} with Per Olof Sundman's bestselling semi-documentary novel of 1967, The Flight of the Eagle.

Sundman's interpretation of the personalities involved, the blind spots of the Swedish national <b>culture,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> role of the press is reflected in the film adaptation, Flight of the Eagle (1982), based on his novel and directed by Jan Troell.
