5|$|In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the National Academy of Science {{conducted}} a survey of industry experts regarding {{the pros and cons}} of double-hull design. Some of the advantages of the double-hull design that were mentioned include ease of ballasting in emergency situations, reduced practice of saltwater ballasting in <b>cargo</b> <b>tanks</b> decreases corrosion, increased environmental protection, cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier, tank washing is more efficient, and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.|$|E

25|$|The Westinghouse {{turbine engines}} {{developed}} 9,000 driveshaft horsepower at ninety revolutions per minute, which allowed a maximum sixteen knots, a speed never attained before by any modern tanker of her era. Her method of construction was controversial. For some years, {{the issue of}} welding versus riveting had been raging {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. Hull 190 was built using the new-fashioned welded method, with hopes it would prove once and for all its reliability. The ship also had a composite framing system with two longitudinally continuous bulkheads, which divided the ship into twenty-one <b>cargo</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} {{was found by}} filling the <b>cargo</b> <b>tanks</b> with inert gas (IG), reducing the oxygen level such that the tank remains below the explosive limit. The use of IG {{is seen as the}} biggest step in increasing tanker safety. Ten years later however, fifty people were killed when the Betelgeuse exploded at Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay. The Total tanker was still not fitted with inert gas. The Energy Concentration did have this system, preventing an explosion when it broke in two on 21 July 1980 during discharge at Europoort. It has also saved many lives during the Tanker War.|$|E

25|$|According to the International Maritime Organisation {{oil spills}} can have serious effects on marine life. The OILPOL Convention {{recognized}} that most oil pollution resulted from routine shipboard operations {{such as the}} cleaning of <b>cargo</b> <b>tanks.</b> In the 1950s, the normal practice was simply to wash the tanks out with water and then pump the resulting mixture of oil and water into the sea. OILPOL 54 prohibited the dumping of oily wastes within a certain distance from land and in 'special areas' where the danger to the environment was especially acute. In 1962 the limits were extended {{by means of an}} amendment adopted at a conference organized by IMO. Meanwhile, IMO in 1965 set up a Subcommittee on Oil Pollution, under the auspices of its Maritime Safety committee, to address oil pollution issues.|$|E
500|$|A {{cofferdam}} {{is a small}} {{little space}} left open between two bulkheads, to give protection from heat, fire, or collision. Tankers generally have cofferdams forward and aft of the <b>cargo</b> <b>tanks,</b> and sometimes between individual tanks. A pumpable room houses all the pumps connected to a tanker's cargo lines. [...] Some larger tankers have two pumprooms. A pumproom generally spans the total breadth of the ship.|$|E

40|$|Four broad {{approaches}} to decreasing {{the number of}} <b>cargo</b> <b>tank</b> rollovers were evaluated: driver training, electronic stability aids, improvements in design of the vehicle itself, and highway design. A study of rollover crash statistics confirmed many expectations, {{but a few of}} the factors were not as strong as might have been expected. The portion of rollovers that occur on freeways is 15 to 20. A driver error of one kind or another (e. g., decision or performance error) figures in about three-fourths of <b>cargo</b> <b>tank</b> rollovers. Inattention and distraction account for about 15. Evasive maneuvers were a factor in 5 to 10 of rollovers. Drivers must be trained to appreciate the diverse causes for rollovers and to anticipate the situations that lead to them. Adherence to viable work and rest schedules is crucial. Electronic stability aids automatically slow the truck when it rounds a curve too fast. They can be remarkably effective in preventing this scenario. However, crash statistics and anecdotal accounts consistently show many other factors that can lead to rollovers. Significant reductions in rollover rates can be achieved with modest changes in vehicle stability. <b>Cargo</b> <b>tank</b> trailers of improved stability are currently available for some cargoes. When mountainous terrain or other factors dictate highway designs that can contribute to rollovers, drivers need to be made aware through signage or dispatch instructions.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of this procedure, the term "ARB " refers to the State of California Air Resources Board, and the term "ARB Executive Officer " refers to the Executive Officer of the ARB or his or her {{authorized}} representative or designate. 1. 1 General Applicability This procedure applies to the determination of the one minute static pressure performance of a vapor recovery system of a <b>cargo</b> <b>tank</b> by fluid mechanical principles. This procedure applies to any vapor emissions associated with the dispensing of any fluid, although it is written to reflect application to the hydrocarbon vapors associated with the dispensing of gasoline. 1. 2 Determinations of Compliance and Violation Determinations of certain modes of compliance with and violation of certification specifications is outlined in § 9. 1. 3 Modifications Modification of this procedure may be necessary for vapors and fluids other than the hydrocarbon vapors associated with the dispensing of gasoline. Any modification of this method shall be subject to approval by the ARB Executive Officer. 2 PRINCIPLE AND SUMMARY OF TEST PROCEDURE Upon completion of loading operations at the bulk gasoline distribution facility, the gasoline <b>cargo</b> <b>tank</b> is pressurized, with nitrogen, to 18 inches water column. By using the total cargo California Air Resources Board March 17, 1999 TP- 204. 2, Page 1 tank shell capacity, post-loading headspace volume, and the Ideal Gas Law, a one-minute maximum allowable pressure decay is calculated. The pressure decay is monitored for one minute and compliance is determined by comparison with the maximum allowable calculated value. The leak rate through the <b>cargo</b> <b>tank</b> internal vapor vent valve is similarly obtained. ...|$|R

2500|$|While steam turbine-driven {{merchant}} ships {{such as the}} Algol-class {{cargo ships}} (1972–1973), ALP Pacesetter-class container ships (1973–1974) and very large crude carriers were built until the 1970s, the use of steam for marine propulsion in the commercial market has declined dramatically due {{to the development of}} more efficient diesel engines. One notable exception are LNG carriers which use boil-off gas from the <b>cargo</b> <b>tanks</b> as fuel. However, even there the development of dual-fuel engines has pushed steam turbines into a niche market with about 10% market share in newbuildings in 2013. Lately, there has been some development in hybrid power plants where the steam turbine is used together with gas engines.

2500|$|Another Liberator {{transport}} variant, the C-109, carried gasoline in converted B-24Js or B-24Ls. All combat {{equipment was}} removed and eight flexible bag fuel tanks were installed inside the fuselage with a 2,900 U.S. gallon capacity. 70 were initially planned {{to fly the}} Hump with XX Bomber Command, beginning in September 1944, {{but most of the}} 218 C-109 conversions eventually served in the CBI under ATC after B-29 operations were shifted from China back to India. At least 80 were involved in major accidents between September 1944 and August 1945. Like the C-87, they were not popular with their crews, since they were very difficult to land when fully loaded, particularly at airfields such as Kunming's above [...] in elevation, and often demonstrated unstable flight characteristics when all eight <b>cargo</b> <b>tanks</b> were full.
