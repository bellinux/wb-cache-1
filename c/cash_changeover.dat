It argues that the denomination of prices in a new currency has increased the information-processing requirements for consumers by more than for sellers, a wedge that can lead to price increases. The size of the wedge should depend on the complexity of the currency conversion rates. In line with this theory, the paper finds that the evolution of prices for food products around the <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> varied across countries, depending on the complexity of conversion rates. These changeover effects are found in particular for goods with prices below one euro sold in mid-priced stores. The paper also finds that cross-country differences in the mismatch of perceived and actual inflation {{in the aftermath of the}} <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> are linked to differences in the complexity of conversion rates.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether the price adjustment process in Austria has changed since the changeover to euro notes and coins at the beginning of 2002. For this purpose, we analyze the frequency and size of price adjustments, sectoral and seasonal differences as well as the structure of prices (notably the share of attractive prices) on the basis of micro price observations underlying the Austrian Consumer Price Index (CPI). A data set spanning the period from 1996 to mid- 2006 was used for the analysis. In addition to confirming known results from previous studies – i. e. that price adjustments occur roughly once per year on average, but with strong sectoral differences – our study reveals an unchanged seasonal pattern of price adjustments, with major peaks in January, also after the <b>cash</b> <b>changeover.</b> At the time of the changeover itself, the observed price changes were more frequent but smaller than usual. As upward and downward price adjustments were also roughly balanced, the <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> appears to have had no significant overall inflationary effects, confirming previous studies. The share of attractive prices (i. e. prices ending in 9 or 90, and even prices), which was over 60 % before the <b>cash</b> <b>changeover,</b> plummeted to just over 20 % in early 2002. In the course of the ensuing three to four years, however, this share again approached the level observed prior to the transition.

Furthermore, our results indicate that the latter two factors have a persistent impact. This contributes in explaining why price perceptions have not normalized for several years in some countries. The results suggest that policy measures in countries which are going to introduce the euro should address these issues in order to prevent a similar development as experienced in many euro area countries.

40|$|In {{the euro}} area countries, the euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> was {{accompanied}} {{by the development of}} a significant gap between actual inflation — as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) — and the inflation perceived by the general public; in Austria, this difference was temporarily up to 1. 9 percentage points. The present study shows that the difference in question can in part be attributed to the fact that people 's perception of inflation seems to be based mainly on the prices of goods they buy frequently, whereas official price indices also take into account goods that are purchased less often. According to recent hypotheses on perceived inflation (Brachinger, 2005 a), the public furthermore perceives price increases more strongly than price reductions. Since the prices of frequently bought goods rose faster after the <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> than those of rarely purchased goods, and a higher (unweighted) share of goods became more expensive, people may have perceived the general price rise to have been more pronounced than it actually was. This perception seems to have been reinforced by the fact that consumers expected prices to rise {{as a result of the}} euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> and that they used outdated schilling reference prices when assessing prices in euro. Moreover, the initial lack of psychological prices may have made it more difficult for consumers to become used to prices in euro. Perceived inflation proved to be unexpectedly persistent: It was not until the beginning of 2005 that the gap between perceived inflation and actual inflation was more or less closed. Since then, the close link between actual and perceived inflation that was prevalent before the euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> seems to have gradually resurfaced. The fact that the above-mentioned gap opened up again in the middle of 2005 can probably be explained by the sharp increase in oil prices.

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} on inflation perceptions in the euro area, in particular, following the euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover.</b> It has been pointed out that a gap emerged between observed and perceived inflation since {{the introduction of the}} euro notes and coins. Such a statement relies on the fact that inflation perceptions, measured by the well-known balance statistic from the European Commission's consumer survey, hiked after January 2002 and remained high thereafter, as opposed to the observed inflation, which has remained fairly stable. In this paper, we discuss the issue of inflation perceptions measurement, by comparing the balance statistic with an alternative refined measure, which is computed using the probability method. We argue that the balance statistic should be used carefully, as it can induce to misleading conclusions.

40|$|The electronification {{of retail}} {{payments}} has been rapid in Finland. The use of payment cards and credit transfers is very common. However, cash is still used quite widely, especially for small value purchases. There are no statistics available on values or numbers of cash payments, because cash is in open circulation {{and so it}} is impossile to trace all cash transactions. In this study we investigate cash usage during the period 1995 — 2000 and assess the share of cash usage that cannot be explained. According to our findings, the share of unexplained cash usage amounted to about one-half of currency in circulation in 2000. However, with the recent conversion to euro cash, we have additional information on cash usage. Using this new information, we find that the unexplained share of cash usage was less than one-third in 2000. Cash usage has recently been examined by the central banks of Norway and Sweden.

40|$|This paper assembles an {{original}} panel {{of data from}} 2, 500 restaurants in Italy over the 1998 - 2004 period. The main objective is to study whether the euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> {{had an impact on}} individual pricing behaviour, as it seems to be perceived by consumers. Although the sample is not representative of the whole sector, our interest stems from the possibility of gaining deeper insights from individual data, {{as well as from the}} fact that restaurant prices were at the centre of the public discussion. First, the paper analyses the distribution of price changes in several years, to identify what features may contribute to explain the widespread perception of a large effect of the introduction of the euro on prices. Second, the paper discusses the economic mechanisms that may help explaining the impact of the <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> on prices. The data show that restaurant prices recorded sizeable increases in both 2001 and 2002 (around 10 % and 9 %, respectively). The cumulated increase in the price of a meal between 1998 and 2003 is substantial (the index rises by 40 %). The changeover might have focused the public attention over this medium-run trend, prompting the attribution of the whole increase to the introduction of the euro. The analysis suggests that such increases reflect in part unfavourable developments on the costs side (strong increases in unit labour costs and fresh food inputs in both years) and strong increases in demand (especially in 2001). Part of the restaurant price increase recorded in 2002, however, does seem ascribable to the effect of the changeover. We find evidence consistent with a ‘menu-cost’ hypothesis for pricing behaviour: the rise in the average meal price is mainly due to a greater fraction of agents who revise their price, rather than to greater individual price revisions. Moreover, more market power (as proxied by a local concentration index) is associated with greater than average price increases during the changeover. A simple interpretation is proposed for this finding, which may also explain why the effects of the <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> may have been especially pronounced in this industry as opposed to more competitive ones. euro changeover; inflation; menu cost...|$|E

40|$|At {{the moment}} of the euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover,</b> {{inflation}} perceptions in the euro area deviated from measured inflation, and in some euro-area Member States in a persistent way. In recent years, a growing body of literature has developed on the factors that might explain this deviation. This paper formally tests various explanations advanced in this literature. It adopts a cross-country perspective {{at the level of the}} euro area which is empirically implemented through a dynamic panel data model. Inflation perceptions are found to be highly persistent (the autoregressive term is large and statistically highly significant). In contrast to much of the - descriptive - literature, an index of "out-of-the-pocket expenditure" is found not to explain inflation perceptions better than does the all-items HICP index. As suggested by psychological experiments, inflation expectations seem to contribute to the formation of inflation perceptions, although to a limited extent. Prices of residential real estate contribute significantly to inflation perceptions, suggesting that households have a broader view of the cost of living when forming inflation perceptions. Our results have implications for policy, for the further research agenda and for the development of statistics. In particular, the persistence of inflation perceptions makes us think that communication efforts prior to euro introduction are essential to anchor perceptions. Once perceptions increase, it will be much harder to bring them back in line with measured inflation. inflation, perceived inflation, dynamic panel data model, euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover,</b> D�hring, Mordonu...|$|E

We show that stronger convergence is associated with periods of positive and less-dispersed output gaps across member states.

40|$|After the {{introduction}} of the euro notes and coins in January 2002, throughout the Economic and Monetary Union member countries there was a widespread feeling that the euro had brought about a significant hike in consumer prices. A substantial discrepancy was evident between inflation as measured by the official consumer price indices (CPI) and the one perceived by the general public. In this paper the German case is treated. First, a short overview is given on the public discussions and the many studies published by the German Federal Statistical Office. Then a newly developed theory of inflation perception is outlined and a corresponding index of perceived inflation (IPI) is developed. This index has been calculated for Germany. In {{the main part of the}} paper, the results are presented. The IPI time series for Germany from 1996 through 2006 clearly show a special inflation around {{the introduction}} of the Euro notes and coins.

The analysis of the micro CPI data shows that consumer prices are adjusted roughly once a year averaged over all items in the CPI. However, there are enormous differences across sectors: The prices of energy products and unprocessed food are adjusted most often whereas the prices of nonenergy industrial goods and of services are changed less frequently. Austria ranks roughly in the middle range among euro area countries in terms of the frequency of price changes; it does not stand out for either especially rigid or especially flexible prices. Judging from the data set analyzed, the euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> did not bring about a significant inflationary effect. The supplementary company survey revealed that (producer) prices are reviewed four times as often as they are actually adjusted — about once a year.

Using micro data on {{consumer}} prices and sectoral inflation rates from 6 euro area countries, spanning several years before and after the introduction of the euro, we look at whether EMU has altered the behaviour of retail price setting and/or inflation dynamics.

At the end of 2001 and in the beginning of 2002 (period surrounding the euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover)</b> retail price adjustment frequencies, both up and down, increased substantially, while the magnitude of the price adjustment, also both up and down, was smaller than otherwise. However, both settled quickly back to the earlier patterns. On the contrary, we do find evidence of a decline in the persistence of the inflation process in the mid- 1990 s. This could be due to a structural change in private inflationary expectations due, at least in part, to policies linked to the preparation of EMU; however, this interpretation is weakened by the fact that a similar decline occurred also in the US.

Indeed, the vast majority of consumers, both in the euro area as a whole and in Belgium, were, and still are, under the impression that the new currency has led to pronounced price increases. This article analyses both the movement of actual prices over the five years following the changeover to the euro and the trend in inflation perceptions as indicated by the European Commission’s consumer survey. It also considers a number of factors which {{may have contributed to the}} breaking of the link between actual and perceived inflation. There is clear evidence that the euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> led to a severing of the link between actual and perceived inflation. However, the direct impact on inflation was small in 2002. But, as it was concentrated in certain less competitive sectors where isolated goods and services are purchased, it was fairly visible. Since then, inflation has remained relatively low, but there has been greater dispersion in the movement of relative prices. At the microeconomic level, the process of price adjustment, which seems relatively slow, gave rise to a new attractive price structure and an increase in the number of prices used in the economy. Such structural changes probably imply that consumers experience difficulties in getting used to the euro. At the same time, these observations also illustrate indirectly that the process of adjusting prices to the euro is correctly reflected in the data used to measure inflation, so that the HICP is an accurate measure of inflation, even if consumers may see things differently. While the changeover’s role in the development of a persistent perception gap cannot be denied, it is very difficult to identify possible explanatory factors more precisely. The statement that consumers tend to form their perceptions on the basis of the movement in prices of frequently purchased items is not sufficient to explain a persistent perception gap. The socioeconomic characteristics of consumers did not play a dominant role either, while the impact of more psychological factors is difficult to assess. The specific characteristics of the HICP inflation measurement do not appear to have played a significant role in the emergence of the perception gap in the euro area. A similar gap arises when the national CPIs are used as benchmarks instead of the HICP; the non-inclusion of the costs of owner occupied housing was not a key factor either. The fact that the accuracy and credibility of the HICP per se are not at stake is reassuring from the point of view of monetary policy. euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover,</b> inflation, perceived inflation...|$|E
40|$|Austrians widely {{expected}} prices {{to fall on}} account of EU accession, participation in the Single Market and the resulting stepped-up competition. In hindsight, this assessment was partly correct. In {{the course of the}} decade from 1995 to 2004, the inflation rate dropped by half to 1. 5 % per annum from 2. 7 % (1987 — 1994). Initial price declines, e. g. in the food sector and later also in some service industries (such as the insurance industry), however, turned out to be mostly short-lived. By contrast, a number of technical industrial goods, such as computer equipment, saw sustained and in part huge price reductions. Liberalization entailed price effects in network industries, with prices in the telecommunications sector a case in point: they decreased over extended periods. Conversely, prices in many service industries have been continually uptrending. Overall inflation hardly changed following the street debut of euro banknotes and coins at the beginning of 2002; yet, prices of some items bought on a day-to-day basis have increased sharply since then. An analysis of the prices of individual items points to frequent price adjustments that coincided with the euro <b>cash</b> <b>changeover</b> in January 2002. Since upward and downward price adjustments roughly balanced each other out, no marked effect on the aggregate inflation rate was observed. To date, European integration has steadily caused price levels to converge, albeit at an altogether modest pace. Prices, Inflation, Austria, Monetary Union, EU Accession...|$|E
