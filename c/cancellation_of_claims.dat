The Software Freedom Law Center filed a re-examination request on behalf of ATutor, and two other clients in late 2006.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{concerned}} with the situation that occurs in claims reserving when there are negative values in the development triangle <b>of</b> incremental <b>claim</b> amounts. Typically, these negative values will be the result of salvage recoveries, payments from third parties, total or partial <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> outstanding <b>claims,</b> due to initial overestimation of the loss or to possible favorable jury decision in favor of the insurer, rejection by the insurer, or just plain errors. Some of the traditional methods <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> reserving, such as the chain-ladder technique, may produce estimates of the reserves even when there are negative values. However, many methods can break down in the presence of enough (in number and/or size) negative incremental claims if certain constraints are not met. Historically the chain-ladder method {{has been used as a}} gold standard (benchmark), due to its generalized use and ease of application. A method that improves on the gold standard is one that can handle situations where there are many negative incremental <b>claims</b> and/or some <b>of</b> these are large. We present a Bayesian model to consider negative incremental values, based on a three parameter log-normal distribution. The model presented here allows the actuary to provide point estimates and measures of dispersion, as well as the complete distribution for outstanding claims from which the reserves can be derived.

40|$|In {{the roughly}} 20 {{months since the}} Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) was born, petitioners have filed over a {{thousand}} requests for inter partes review (IPR), roughly 200 of which {{have come to a}} final conclusion.

Though this data has already made quite a splash in the patent community, it alone tells us little about whether IPR is thus far accomplishing its original goal of serving as a quick, efficient alternative to defending patent suits filed in federal court, particularly those filed by non-practicing entities.

5000|$|An anime {{adaptation}} of Hetalia: Axis Powers was announced on July 24, 2008. It {{is directed by}} Bob Shirohata (Gravitation, Diamond Daydreams) and is animated by Studio Deen. It was originally scheduled for broadcast on Kids Station on January 24, 2009 but was later canceled. The cancellation only affected the Kids Stations broadcasts; plans to make the series available through mobile phone and Internet streaming were not affected. The controversies arose when numerous Korean protesters called for the <b>cancellation</b> <b>of</b> the series, <b>claiming</b> that the personified character of Korea was an insulting representation of Koreans. Kids Station claimed that the Korea character {{does not appear in}} the anime and that it was [...] "unaware of the criticism in Korea," [...] and cited [...] "various circumstances" [...] as being behind the decision to cancel its airing of the anime, but they did not provide further information as to the nature of these circumstances. A second 26-episode season of Hetalia: Axis Powers was announced on April 16, 2009, and a third was announced on December 10, 2009. As of March 7, 2010, the title of the anime has been changed to Hetalia: World Series. A fourth season had been announced for Hetalia and premiered on September 10, 2010.
