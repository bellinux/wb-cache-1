50|$|Close {{proximity}} strikes {{by lightning}} will always {{set off the}} ground fault circuit and at times blow the system out if the system did not follow NEC code Art. 250.94 which illustrates how {{to get rid of}} grounding differentials. A good ground filter/notch filter will prevent a feedback loop up <b>case</b> <b>ground</b> which causes false alarms. Also surge suppression improperly installed inside a fire alarm panel will also cause a feedback loop up <b>case</b> <b>ground</b> and cause false alarms. So the surge suppression must be outside the box, in a plastic box and not grounded directly to the fire panel, rather the grounded to the ground side/line side of the in-line series three stage two tank circuit designed AC surge suppression. Parallel will not protect a fire alarm panel nor prevent false alarms. In series surge suppression will at least help one control where the surges are coming from and the ground filter will also help. Tie three to four knots in the low voltage wire between the low voltage surge suppress and the fire alarm panel, and tie at least one knot in the phase/neutral/and ground wire attached to the power supply. This will help mitigate false alarms, as well as help one's surge suppression do a better job.|$|E
50|$|Initially, it was {{feared that}} the {{lightning}} strike could have caused the Command Module's (CM) parachute mechanism to prematurely fire, disabling the explosive bolts that open the parachute compartment to deploy them. If they were indeed disabled, the Command Module would have crashed uncontrollably into the Pacific Ocean and killed the crew instantly. Since {{there was no way}} to figure out whether or not this was the <b>case,</b> <b>ground</b> controllers decided not to tell the astronauts about the possibility. The parachutes deployed and functioned normally at the end of the mission.|$|E
50|$|If a {{power outage}} occurs on {{system with a}} weak backup battery it can cause the alarm to trigger. Preventing this type of false alarm {{requires}} alarm owner to periodically replace the backup battery.Most people should have surge suppression on the AC power {{as well as the}} RJ31X area. If properly installed, the surges should bypass the system. So to help prevent a feedback loop up <b>case</b> <b>ground,</b> never install the RJ31X surge suppression inside the burglar alarm panel, and only ground it to the ground lug of the AC surge suppression. To even reduce more false alarms, tie three to four knots in the phone line between the RJ31X Surge suppression and the panel as well as three to four knots in the low voltage AC power source feeding the panel after the AC surge suppression.|$|E

5000|$|When partial {{discharge}} is initiated, high frequency transient current pulses will appear and persist for nanoseconds to a microsecond, then disappear and reappear repeatedly as the voltage sinewave {{goes through the}} zero crossing. The PD happens near the peak voltage both positive and negative. PD pulses are easy to measure using the HFCT method. The HFCT is a [...] "high frequency" [...] current transducer which is clamped around the <b>case</b> <b>ground</b> of the component being tested. The severity of the PD is measured by measuring the burst interval {{between the end of}} a burst {{and the beginning of the}} next burst. As the insulation breakdown worsens, the burst interval will shorten due to the breakdown happening at lower voltages. This burst interval will continue to shorten until a critical 2 millisecond point is reached. At this 2 ms point the discharge is very close to the zero crossing and will fail with a full blown discharge and major failure. The HFCT method needs to be used because of the small magnitude and short duration of these PD events. The HFCT method is done while the component being tested stays energized and loaded. It is completely non-intrusive. Another method of measuring these currents is to put a small current-measuring resistor in series with the sample and then view the generated voltage on an oscilloscope via a matched coaxial cable.|$|E

The second stage tests stack emissions and uses meteorological dispersion models, particularly the double gaussian model, to determine and test three hour, twenty-four hour and annual worst <b>case</b> <b>ground</b> level concentrations. The third stage calculates the performance of the abatement method used in terms of economics and resource costs.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Global Positioning System has {{achieved}} a maturity whereby a large marketplace of users have developed. This marketplace has been flooded with many types of receivers from {{a large number of}} manufacturers. The broad acceptance of the system among military as well as commercial users has created this market, and receiver availability due to planned mass production has precipitated substantial price reduction for GPS receivers. OEM receivers are presently available on the market at such a low cost that their incorporation into flight test systems should be seriously considered. The data produced by the system has a reasonable and usable accuracy for platform position, flight vectors and time. These are suitable in most range applications and can either augment or replace present tracking methods such as multilateration or triangulation for vehicle position. The advantages of eliminating the need for tracking functions in ground control stations are obvious especially in multi-vehicle operations such as in air-to-air weaponry testing and range training missions.

In this thesis we provide a language level semantically well defined solution for (1) the definition of ASM modules as independent services and their communication behaviour; (2) a new construct that operates on the global state of an ASM machine that ease the management of state partitions and their identification; (3) a novel transition rule for the management of computations providing different execution strategies and putting termination condition for the machine inside the specification; (4) a data definition convention along with a new transition rule for their manipulation via pattern matching. In our work we build upon CoreASM, a well-known extensible modelling framework and tool environment for ASMs. The semantic of our modularity constructs is compatible with the one defined for the CoreASM interpreter.

A {{number of cases}} were simulated in steady state to get {{an understanding of the}} interaction between the wing, the front wheels, the car body (monocoque) and the ground. Three different flap settings were simulated in three different heights in combinations with and without the following elements: Front wheels, monocoque, ground, front wing. The SST k-omega turbulence model was used with a polyhedral mesh. Chord Reynolds numbers were between 545 000 [...] 600 000. It was found that both the front wing operating isolated from other components and the wing operating in interaction with the front wheels and the monocoque responded with increased downforce in ground effect. Optimal ground height was dependent on flap setting: The mild configuration did not stall at any of the simulated heights, while the flaps on the aggressive configuration stalled close to the ground in the isolated <b>case.</b> <b>Ground</b> effect improved the downforce produced by the wing in free stream by up to 50. 7 %. Comparisons of the wing in mild and high downforce settings were done with and without the wheels. The wing-wheel interaction reduced the downforce produced in the mild flap angle setting by 20. 5 % by obstructing the flow, but increased the downforce of the high flap angle setting by 2. 2 % by introducing surface normal adverse pressure gradients, preventing boundary layer separation. The wing-monocoque interaction increased downforce in all simulated cases. The monocoque caused increased velocity and suction {{on the bottom of the}} symmetric center section, thus reducing the 3 D effects across the span toward the high-downforce section. This contributed to enhanced sectional lift coefficient along the complete span, increasing downforce produced by the wing with low flap angles and wheels behind by 14. 3 % and correspondingly for the high flap angle an increase of 10. 8 %. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cement is a {{vital and}} {{commonly}} used construction material that requires large amounts of resources and the manufacture of which causes significant environmental impact. However, {{there are many different}} types of cement products, roughly ranging from traditional products with rather linear resource flows to more synergistic alternatives where industrial byproducts are utilized to a large extent. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies indicate the synergistic products are favorable from an environmental perspective. In co-operation with the global cement producing company CEMEX a research project has been carried out to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the CO 2 performance of different ways of producing cement, and different cement products. The focus has been on Cluster West, which is a cement production cluster consisting of three plants in Germany. This paper is the first in a series of three, all of which are included in this special issue. It has two main aims. The first is to carry out an attributional LCA and compare three different cement products produced in both linear and synergistic production setups. This has been done for cradle to gate, focusing on CO 2 -eq emissions for Cluster West. The second aim of this part is to develop and test a simplified LCA model for this production cluster, with the intention to be able to compare different versions of the production system based on the information of a few parameters. The attributional LCA showed that cement products that contain a large proportion of byproducts, in this <b>case,</b> <b>ground</b> granulated blast furnace slag from the iron and steel industry, had the lowest unit emissions of CO 2 -eq. The difference between the lowest emission product (CEM III/B) and the highest (CEM I) was about 66 % per tonne. A simplified LCA model based on six key performance indicators, instead of approximately 50 parameters for the attributional LCA, was established. It showed that Cluster West currently emits about 45 % less CO 2 -eq per tonne of average product compared to 1997. The simplified LCA model can be used effectively to model future changes of both plants and products (which is further discussed in part II and part III) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{study the}} flow {{structure}} of tornado-like vortices {{and their impact}} over engineering structures is important due {{to the extent of}} tornado induced fatalities and damages observed each year in North America and around the world. In the present study, a numerical modeling approach inspired by the WindEEE Dome and the modified version of Ward’s Tornado Simulator has been developed. Using a full-scale numerical simulator, tornadoes of different intensities have been simulated for different swirl ratio values to study flow structures in comparison with previous studies. The effect of topographic features on the tornado-like vortex has been investigated for the first time. A new approach to quantify the changes in the tornadic wind field “speed-up” due to the topography has been developed. Once a confidence level is achieved on tornado flow structure under flat terrain and with topographic features scenarios, the interaction of the tornado-like vortex with bluff bodies is modeled. For this purpose, both low- and high rise buildings are considered. More emphasis has been given to the low-rise building and hence it has been further investigated for stationary and translating tornado under sealed and opened conditions. The open condition represents breaching on the building envelope due to, for example, wind born debris. Selected experiments have been conducted at WindEEE Dome for validating the numerical model. For the low-rise building, the overall pressure distribution along the wall surfaces of the body are dominated by the external tornado pressure field (suction) near the ground surface that develops due to the high angular momentum of the flow. For large tornado size with respect to the study buildings, the Cp on the entire building surface resemble the near ground suction irrespective of the shape. Thus, indicating that at the tornado center, the effect of the interaction of tornado with the bluff body is minimum. This is not the case for smaller tornadoes. The tornado building interaction effects (i. e. aerodynamics) start to be dominant as the tornado center is located far away from the study building. A comparison with ABL flow reveals that the Cp magnitudes and their distributions are quite different for tornado center and core radius locations. For offset position of tornado center with respect to the building, the tornado induced Cp value starts to resemble the ones from ABL-flow case. For opening <b>case,</b> <b>ground</b> suction dominates the overall pressure distribution for all the locations of tornado. As a result, irrespective of the number and location of openings, suction is higher {{both inside and outside the}} bluff-body at tornado center and it decreases as tornado moves away from the bluff-body (core radius and outside core regions). For the high-rise building, an additional vertical pressure variation, not seen in the shorter buildings, as the tornado vortex interacts with the building has been observed. The CFD study has been validated in comparison with WindEEE experiments. These studies are expected to contribute to addressing the lack of tornadic aerodynamic characteristics. In the long run this will contribute in enhancing the resiliency of the built environment and safety of our communities...|$|E
