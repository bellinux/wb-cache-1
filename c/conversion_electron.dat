40|$|Mössbauer {{spectroscopy}} {{is regarded}} generally a bulk technique.

One of the limitations of CEMS {{from the point of view}} of the surface analyst is that its surface sensitivity is lower than that of other standard analytical techniques such as XPS or AES.

50|$|The {{detailed}} decay {{mechanism is}} electron capture {{to form an}} excited state of the nearly-stable nuclide tellurium-123 (half life so long that it is considered stable for all practical purposes). This excited state of Te-123 produced is not the metastable nuclear isomer Te-123m (the decay of I-123 does not involve enough energy to produce Te-123m), but rather is a lower-energy nuclear isomer of Te-123 that immediately gamma decays to ground state Te-123 at the energies noted, or else (13% of the time) decays by internal <b>conversion</b> <b>electron</b> emission (127 keV), followed {{by an average of}} 11 Auger electrons emitted at very low energies (50-500 eV). The latter decay channel also produces ground-state Te-123. Especially because of the internal conversion decay channel, I-123 is not an absolutely pure gamma-emitter, although it is sometimes clinically assumed to be one.|$|E
50|$|The gamma-emitting {{isotopes}} iodine-123 (half-life 13 hours), and (less commonly) the longer-lived {{and less}} energetic iodine-125 (half-life 59 days) {{are used as}} nuclear imaging tracers to evaluate the anatomic and physiologic function of the thyroid. Abnormal results {{may be caused by}} disorders such as Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Both isotopes decay by electron capture (EC) to the corresponding tellurium nuclides, but in neither case are these the metastable nuclides Te-123m and Te125m (which are of higher energy, and are not produced from radioiodine). Instead, the excited tellurium nuclides decay immediately (half-life too short to detect). Following EC, the excited Te-123 from I-123 emits a high-speed 127 keV internal <b>conversion</b> <b>electron</b> (not a beta ray) about 13% of the time, but this does little cellular damage due to the nuclide's short half-life and the relatively small fraction of such events.

50|$|A {{radionuclide}} (radioactive nuclide, radioisotope or radioactive isotope) is an atom {{that has}} excess nuclear energy, making it unstable. This excess energy {{can be either}} emitted from the nucleus as gamma radiation, or create and emit from the nucleus a new particle (alpha particle or beta particle), or transfer this excess energy to one of its electrons, causing that electron to be ejected as a <b>conversion</b> <b>electron.</b> During those processes, the radionuclide is said to undergo radioactive decay. These emissions constitute ionizing radiation. The unstable nucleus is more stable following the emission, but will sometimes undergo further decay. Radioactive decay is a random process {{at the level of}} single atoms: it is impossible to predict when one particular atom will decay. However, for a collection of atoms of a single element the decay rate, and thus the half-life (t1/2) for that collection can be calculated from their measured decay constants. The range of the half-lives of radioactive atoms have no known limits and span a time range of over 55 orders of magnitude.|$|E
40|$|A new beam line at {{the fast}} neutron {{spallation}} source at Los Alamos Neutron Science Center has been constructed for studies of neutron-induced reactions producing gamma rays, internal <b>conversion</b> <b>electrons</b> or neutrons. This facility, called FIGARO (Fast neutron-Induced GAmma-Ray Observer), follows on the great successes of GEANIE (described in other contributions to this Conference), by detecting de-excitation gamma rays with high-resolution germanium detectors.

50|$|The {{detailed}} decay {{mechanism to}} form the stable daughter nuclide tellurium-125 is a multi-step process that begins with electron capture. This {{is followed by a}} cascade of electron relaxation as the core electron hole moves toward the valence orbitals. The cascade involves many Auger transitions, each of which cause the atom to become increasingly ionized. The electron capture produces a tellurium-125 nucleus in an excited state with a half-life of 1.6 ns, which undergoes gamma decay emitting a photon or an internal <b>conversion</b> <b>electron</b> at 35.5 keV. A second electron relaxation cascade follows the gamma decay before the nuclide comes to rest. Throughout the entire process an average of 13.3 electrons are emitted (10.3 of which are Auger electrons), most with energies less than 400 eV (79% of yield). The internal conversion and Auger electrons from the radioisotope have been found in one study to do little cellular damage, unless the radionuclide is incorporated chemically directly into cellular DNA, which is not the case for present radiopharmaceuticals which use I-125 as the radioactive label nuclide.|$|E
