The role of Mary would have been rewritten to be an aquacade star (and was eventually filled by June Allyson as [...] "Kay", a nightclub singer). Williams redecorated her dressing room to accommodate returning star Grace Kelly, packed her terry cloth robes and swimsuits and drove off the studio lot. As a result of leaving her contract, Williams lost almost $3 million in deferred contract payments, which {{had been taken from}} her paychecks over the previous 14 years and put aside as both a nest egg and a tax deferral. She was, however, still able to collect on the $50,000 signing bonus from when she first signed her contract.|$|E
50|$|Under {{the common}} law, the {{employer}} may summarily dismiss the employee if the latter’s misconduct is serious, or dismiss the employee merely {{by giving the}} required notice. Occasionally, the employer may prefer to impose a less severe penalty, but the employer’s action in imposing a penalty may not amount to a breach of <b>contract.</b> <b>Suspension</b> without pay or demotion, or ordering forfeiture of an agreed bonus {{or part of the}} wages, would constitute a breach of contract. The employer may, however, suspend the employee on full pay and give warnings.|$|E
50|$|The Elusive Pimpernel was {{financed by}} Samuel Goldwyn and Alexander Korda. Neither {{director}} Michael Powell nor star David Niven {{was very interested}} in doing the film, but had their minds changed by threats of <b>contract</b> <b>suspension.</b> (Rex Harrison had been originally announced as the star.) Powell wanted to make the film as a musical, but was not allowed to, and Margaret Leighton was cast despite his objection. Goldwyn forced numerous additions and changes to the film but when Powell delivered the final cut, Goldwyn refused to make the final payment, which caused Korda to sue him.|$|E

50|$|Contracts for {{the various}} parts of the design were sent out in July 1969. Hawker Siddeley Dynamics won the <b>{{contract}}</b> for the <b>suspensions</b> and braking systems, GEC and English Electric won the contract for the trailer cars, and by this time Leyland had already been selected for the engines. Over time a number of these contracts were withdrawn and the teams took the design in-house, cancelling the <b>suspensions</b> <b>contract</b> with Hawker Siddeley in February 1970. Design of the bogies was taken over with the physical construction contracted to British Rail Engineering, while the power car construction was let to Metro-Cammell.|$|R

40|$|Before taking {{strategic}} {{actions in}} property investments, consider {{the type and}} number of expansion, contraction and suspension alternatives and the future profit volatility. The optimal investment strategy for a current or prospective property owner should reflect the expected variability of future profits (rent times occupancy times units available), and current profits relative to threshold trigger profits {{for a variety of}} alternative states and actions. These alternatives include remaining idle, building and operating properties, expanding, contracting, suspending, reverting to normal service or reduced service capacity, or abandoning. A valuation model is developed for up to eight different options, each with a distinct trigger. Then numerical solutions show optimal profit triggers and valuations for each of these real options. Generally, increasing the number of options reduces the investment and abandonment triggers, and increases the values of the investment option and total option values, given these alternatives and parameters. The relevant parameters will depend on the investment context and feasible actions, but generally include interest rates, profit volatility, and irrecoverable costs of investment, expansion, <b>contracting,</b> <b>suspension</b> and abandonment. Generally increases in investment costs reduce the value of upward options, and increases the optimal triggers for exercising those options. Increases in expected profit volatility increase the value of all options, increases investment triggers and decreases abandonment triggers. These generic models may be appropriate for many contexts where the costs of changing states are partially irrecoverable, yet where management has some flexibility to alter scale, quality and pricing of assets and services.

40|$|Large {{opencast}} {{coal mines}} require a complex infrastructure to fulfill production demand and quality values. The distinct specifications required by each customer are achieved by blending adjustments. There is limited control in variability. With only partial information available, operation controllers blend coal by empirical approximation, {{trying to keep}} quality between acceptable ranges {{in order to avoid}} penalizations, shipment rejections or even <b>contract</b> <b>suspensions.</b> When a decision support system (DSS) centralized in a control room is used for blending control, crew operators visualize enhanced displays of the different sources of information, obtaining a holistic perspective of operations. Using a simulator to reproduce the blending sequence, crew operators can experiment with diverse what-if scenarios and develop blending strategies for an entire working shift, in which they also incorporate their own expertise and the knowledge obtained after interpreting the simulation results. The research focuses on the empirical analysis of the effectiveness of the DSS by studying the performance of crew users in different operating scenarios produced with a simulator. The development of a methodology for measuring this effectiveness and its impact in the quantification of controlling the variability of blending represents a significant contribution in the area of quality improvement for coal production. The effectiveness of the DSS for controlling the blending and load out processes has been numerically measured after experimenting diverse simulated scenarios, proving that the difference between estimated and actual quality delivered is narrower when using a DSS, in comparison with the BTU variability obtained from historical data. The strategies that produced better results in terms of control of coal quality variability, maximization of infrastructure utilization, time spent in making decisions and the minimization of risk for penalizations and rejections, were scored proportionally to the benefits obtained...|$|R

40|$|Since 1941, six Executive Orders {{have been}} issued forbidding Federal {{government}} contractors from discriminating against minority workers. In principle, all prospective contractors are required to demonstrate compliance with the law before a contract is let. The potential penalties are severe: failure {{to comply with the}} law may result in revocation of current <b>contracts</b> and <b>suspension</b> of the right to bid on future contracts. Despite these provisions, doubts have been raised about the effectiveness of the Orders. Defenders of the Orders cite cases in which contract award dates have been postponed until firms have taken steps toward compliance with the law. In this paper, we investigate these competing claims using data from 40, 445 establishments sampled in 1966 and 1970. In the first section of this paper, we distinguish what can be measured from what cannot. We develop a framework to measure and interpret program effects. In the second section we discuss the design of our sample and present results of an analysis of the randomness of this sample. In the third and concluding section, we present the estimates and discuss their plausibility. ...|$|R

40|$|Demand for timber in Leyte Province {{continues}} to increase whilst supplies from domestic sources have <b>contracted</b> following <b>suspension</b> of logging in remaining natural forests. One approach to meet the deficit in timber supplies has been to encourage timber planting by smallholders. A survey was undertaken in four rural communities to help assess present tree planting and management activities of households and their tree planting and management intentions. It was found out that not more than 100 trees are managed by each of about 61 % of the households who have planted trees. There were 88 different species planted or managed by households, but 83 % of the total trees planted belong to only 10 species, including mahogany, ipil-ipil, gmelina and molave. The primary purpose of tree planting is to meet household needs for timber for dwelling construction and fruit production. About 72 % of the total trees being managed by households were planted, as distinct from natural regeneration, with planting stock coming mostly from own seeds, nursery and wildlings. Only four respondents had registered any of their trees with the Department of Natural Resources and Environment (necessary for commercial harvesting), {{the main reason for}} lack of registration appearing to be lack of awareness of this procedure...|$|R

Dickerson, at 29, was the highest paid running back in the NFL, {{receiving}} an annual reported salary of $1.4 million. Following prolonged contract disputes, the fed-up Colts placed him on the inactive list {{before the start of}} the 1990 season where he stayed for 7 weeks and lost more than $600,000 in salary. In his sixth game back from suspension, he rushed for 143 yards against the Bengals on 22 carries—this effort lifted him past Jim Brown to third place on the NFL career rushing list behind Walter Payton and Tony Dorsett. He was again suspended in November 1991, and amidst injuries and age, managed to run for only 536 yards that season. The Colts finished the year bottoming out with a 1-15 record.|$|R

Hextall missed all but eight games due to <b>suspension,</b> <b>contract</b> holdout issues and injury, the suspension given for attacking Chris Chelios {{at the end of the}} Montreal playoff series the previous spring. Holmgren replaced Dave Poulin as captain in December with Ron Sutter, which led to Poulin's (and later that season, Brian Propp's) trade to Boston. As a result, the Flyers missed the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since 1972. Bob Clarke, having been with the Flyers organization since he was drafted in 1969, was fired and replaced as GM by Russ Farwell; Clarke resurfaced with the Minnesota North Stars. Hextall continued to be hampered by injuries during the 1990–91 season. He only played in 36 games and as a result the Flyers missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year, finishing fifth in the Division and three points short of a playoff spot after a late-season collapse.|$|R
40|$|Disputes {{have become}} an {{inherent}} feature of the construction industry projects. However few research projects have focused on this niche area in South Africa. The {{purpose of this study}} was to unearth causes of disputes and their effects on construction projects and to further determine the methods that are used to settle the disputes. In order to determine the objectives of this study, semi-structured interviews were used. Thirty practitioners i. e. professionals in the construction industry were purposively invited to participate. Fourteen practitioners accepted to participate in the interviews which represented 47 % response rate. The results of the interviews were analyzed using content analysis that is coding of reoccurring themes from the interviews. The study revealed nine factors that contribute to causes of disputes in construction projects namely; poor communication, poor <b>contract</b> documentation, <b>suspension</b> of work, failure to understand and correctly bid or price the work, bad weather, non-circulation of information, i. e. site instruction, distribution of drawings etc., incomplete tracing mechanism for request of information and delay in extension of time. Furthermore, the effects of disputes identified were; project delays, change in contract cost leading to cost overrun, deterioration of relationships or bad relationships leading to friction, parties do not get information on time and neglecting clients’ needs. In order to resolve the disputes the most popular method used was arbitration. However, some respondents opted to use conciliation and mediation. The practicality of the study is that organizations that enter into construction projects should be aware that they may encounter disputes in their projects; hence they should know the methods they can use to resolve them...|$|R
40|$|This work {{builds on}} the model in Goldstein and Pauzner (GP) (2005), a global-games version of the Diamond-Dybvig (DD) (1983) model {{in which there is}} {{uncertainty}} about the long-term return and in which agents observe noisy signals about that return. GP limited their investigation to a banking contract that makes a noncontingent promised payoff to those who withdraw early until the bank's resources are exhausted. We amend the <b>contract</b> and permit <b>suspension.</b> As we show, there is a class of suspension policies that gives rise to uniqueness without requiring the new assumption introduced in a proof in GP; namely, the short-term return is also random. In general, both the GP policy and my generalization of it to allow suspension seem not to be the best banking contracts. However, if the return uncertainty is sufficiently small, then there are policies in the class we study that imply ex ante welfare close to the first-best outcome in DD, which itself is an upper bound on welfare in the model with return uncertainty. ...|$|R
