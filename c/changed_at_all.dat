500|$|In 2003, {{publishers}} Simon & Schuster {{decided to}} end the original Nancy Drew series and feature Nancy's character in a new mystery series, Girl Detective. The Nancy Drew of the Girl Detective series drives a hybrid car, uses a mobile phone, and recounts her mysteries in the first person. Many applaud these changes, arguing that Nancy has not really <b>changed</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> other than learning to use a cell phone. Others praise the series as more realistic; Nancy, these commentators argue, is now a less-perfect and therefore more likable being, one whom girls can more easily relate to– a better role model than the old Nancy because she can actually be emulated, rather than a [...] "prissy automaton of perfection." ...|$|E
500|$|Corbie Dillard at Nintendo Life {{criticized the}} Wii version for using resized {{graphics}} from the Nintendo DS version without doing any [...] "touch-ups", {{resulting in a}} pixelated look. He also disliked the Wii Remote-based gameplay changes, {{saying that they were}} annoying for people who have already played the portable versions of the game. Lucas M. Thomas at IGN also found it disappointing how the graphics, audio and content had not been <b>changed</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> compared to the Nintendo DS release, saying that the visuals did not look attractive when resized to fit a larger screen; he concluded that it did not seem like the Wii version had been given [...] "any extra love and attention at all". Marissa Meli at GameZone called it a [...] "3/10 interpretation of a 9/10 title", saying that the pixelated graphics made the game look ugly and shoddy.|$|E
500|$|In addition, some reviews {{had mixed}} responses. Simon Brew of Den of Geek rated Redemption 3 out of 5 stars, praising it for showing a more human side of Bauer, the acting of Cherry Jones as Allison Taylor, and named Redemption as a solid bridge between season six and seven. However, Brew was {{critical}} that it plays {{little to no}} havoc {{with the world of}} 24, and that it is lacking at times in urgency. Gerard Gilbert of The Independent stated that the introduction of Jonas Hodges was promising, and praised John Voight's acting, as well as stating that the character is the one most to look forward to in the seventh season. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe gave the film a negative review, giving it a 2 out of 10, calling it [...] "un-fun", and stating that Bauer's character has not <b>changed</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> from past seasons, and asking, [...] "When does a rogue hero [...] become a tired joke? Based on this un-fun movie, I would say yesterday." ...|$|E

500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t <b>changed</b> <b>at</b> <b>all...</b> and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ballpark dimensions: This theory {{contends that}} {{offensive}} success came from {{changes in the}} dimensions of the ballparks. [...] Accurate estimates of ballpark sizes of the era can be difficult to find, however, so there is disagreement over whether the dimensions <b>changed</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> let alone whether the change led to improved offense. A 1920 season rule change stated that balls hit over the fence in fair territory but landing foul were fair, and hence home runs rather than foul balls. This rule change greatly pleased hitters for both New York City teams, whose many [...] "hooking" [...] home runs were called foul in the Polo Grounds.|$|E

2500|$|The B-type wing was {{structurally}} an A type {{modified to}} carry one 20mm Hispano cannon per wing, which replaced the two inner [...]303 machine guns. The retractable underwing landing lamp was repositioned. The cannon {{was installed in}} the innermost machine gun bay, next to the wheelwell, while the second gun was deleted altogether. The area where the inner guns ammunition trays had been located, outboard of the cannon bay, was converted into a compartment to accommodate the 60-round drum magazine for the cannon. The upper and lower wing skins now incorporated blisters to clear the large ammunition drum (the underwing blisters came in two different shapes). The remaining outer pairs of [...]303's were not <b>changed</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Only one armament suite could be fitted to a Spitfire with the B-type wing: Two 20mm Hispano Mk II cannon, each with a 60-round drum, and four [...]303 caliber Browning machine guns in the outer positions, with 350 rpg. Alloy-covered ailerons were standardised on this wing type.|$|E
