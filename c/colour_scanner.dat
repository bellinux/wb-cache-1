50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1974, CEL, with 1,300 employees, {{was ready for a}} public listing on the London Stock Exchange. The company had {{increased}} sales from 3.6 million to 10.6 million pounds and profits from 0.2 million to 1.0 million pounds in the preceding 5 years. 85% of sales went abroad, with the US and Japan its largest markets, and CEL was a world leader in press control and <b>colour</b> <b>scanner</b> equipment. Bank borrowings had increased from 0.2 million to 1.1 million pounds in the same period and, although net equity had increased fourfold to 2.1 million pounds, the company required a larger capital base to finance production to satisfy the soaring demand for its colour scanners. The Stock Market crashed, the FTSE 30 losing 73% of its value, all new issues were pulled and the company found itself in a quandary: in this period of uncertainty neither banks nor Government were willing to make a loan to CEL. To ensure its future, Crosfield sold the company to De La Rue for 6 million pounds in September 1974. This proved to be an excellent investment for De La Rue. In 1988, just the scanner business of CEL made an operating profit of 21 million pounds on sales of 210 million. De La Rue sold the colour scanning business to a joint venture of Fuji and DuPont for 235 million pounds in 1989.|$|E
40|$|Modern anthropometric studies {{involve the}} use of high {{resolution}} 3 D range and <b>colour</b> <b>scanners</b> to digitise the human body. This technology {{has the potential to}} make anthropometric data acquisition more precise than the traditional approach of using a tape measure, ruler and protractor.

If we can achieve the goal of fully automomous anthrometric data acquisition, there is enormous potential for applications in areas such as law enforcement and security as well as the obvious benefit of making anthropometric research more accurate and less time consuming.

Sun was expanding its facilities for colour printing but, due to trade union restrictions, the company could not hire and train enough retouchers. Crosfield thought it a very difficult task, but Sun offered to pay half the R & D costs and Crosfield [...] "decided to have a go". He built a new research team and rented premises at Old Street for the laboratory to develop the <b>colour</b> <b>scanner.</b> The first Scanatron appeared in 1958. By then CEL had a large back order for scanners from rotogravure printers in Europe and the US. Colour scanners became the biggest money earner for the company and Crosfield continued their development, launching the Diascan, an improved and cheaper model in 1965 and the enlarging Magnascan in 1969. This machine scanned a colour slide and had all the equipment and software necessary to adjust the size, form, colour and hue to get the desired result for the publisher. The Magnascans launch at the Milan printing fair caused a sensation. [...] The company continued development of scanners, bringing out new models that improved the versatility, quality and productivity of earlier versions. High quality colour printing was now common in catalogues, magazines and newspapers around the world.|$|E
40|$|The 3 D {{scanning}} {{of human}} faces {{is an important}} tool to acquire accurate shape and texture information of heads and faces for both animation and recognition purposes. One {{of the most popular}} scanning tools is Cyberware head and face 3 D <b>colour</b> <b>scanner.</b> Currently, 3 D face databases scanned using the Cyberware head and face 3 D <b>colour</b> <b>scanner</b> databases are public available and have been used in many face recognition system as the training data, one of which is USF human ID 3 -D database. The mechanism of facial texture capturing, however, remains unclear due to the special settings of the light sources during scanning. The direct application of the acquired texture intensity as the albedo of the face surfaces leads to suboptimal modelling results. This paper analyses the lighting configuration of the scanner and proposes an appropriate reflectance model to describe the reflecting mechanism when scanning. The texture modifications can be carried on in the existing scanning results without any further scans. Experiment results show that the proposed reflectance model can better approximate the reflecting situation of scanning so that the acquired textures can be directly used as diffuse reflectance coefficients and achieve better rendering results.

40|$|Summary: Low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) particles can {{be separated}} into subtractions according to size by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Established research methods require specialised equipment and are frequently unsuited to the clinical laboratory. In this study, we utilised a <b>colour</b> flat bed <b>scanner</b> in conjunc-tion with shareware {{image analysis software}} to compare LDL particle diameters of isolated LDL with LDL in whole plasma. LDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation and electrophoresed on 3 — 13 % gels (Gradipore; Sydney, Australia) for 2400 Volt-hours in parallel with plasma and molecular size standards. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were scanned in reflexive mode using a <b>colour</b> flat-bed <b>scanner</b> and Adobe Photoshop 3. 0 software. Density traces of each lane were obtained using NIH Image software (public domain, USA). LDL particle diameters were deter-mined from calibration curves of the log of molecular diameter of standards against migration distance. There was a good correlation between LDL particle diameters obtained using isolated LDL and whole plasma (r = 0. 87, P < 0. 001; n = 22). However, the group means (± S. D.) (24. 7 ± 0. 6 and 24. 8 ± 0. 5 nm respectively) were statistic-ally different on the paired i-test (P < 0. 05). It is unclear whether this numerically small difference is due to alterations in LDL during the longer preparative procedures for LDL, or to matrix effects during electrophoresis of plasma sam-ples. In conclusion, plasma samples stained with Coomassie Blue and scanned with a <b>colour</b> flat bed <b>scanner</b> can conve-niently be used for LDL particle sizing by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Tropical seas {{are major}} sites for {{extensive}} cyanobacterial (=blue-green algal) developments. The oceanic nitrogen fixation caused by such blooms {{may be of}} relatively great importance {{in regard to the}} global nitrogen budget. A Nimbus- 7 Coastal Zone <b>Colour</b> <b>Scanner</b> (CZCS) image on 4 January 1982 shows a large phytoplankton bloom (90 000 km 2) around New Caledonia and the Vanuatu archipelago, located east of Australia in the Coral Sea (165 ° E, 20 ° S). The bloom is caused by cyanobacteria, presumably Oscillatoria (= Trichodesmium) spp. which occur systematically in this region. This assertion was not controlled by simulta-neous sea-truths, but several indices and current knowledge of the region indicate that our hypothesis is reasonable. By using the CZCS image, an estimation is made for the nitrogen fixation of the bloom. It suggests that such a biological event plays {{a significant role in the}} global nitrogen oceanic budget. 1...|$|E

Particle flux was highly seasonal, with flux maxima occurring in late winter-early spring. A comparison with historic CZCS (Coastal Zone <b>Colour</b> <b>Scanner)</b> data shows that these flux maxima occurred about 1 month after maximum chlorophyll was observed in surface waters in a presumed primary source region 100 km * 100 km northeast of the trap location. The main components of the particles collected with the traps were mineral particles and carbonate, both correlating strongly with organic matter sedimentation. Mineral particles in the sinking matter are indicative of the high aeolian input from the African desert regions. Comparing particle fluxes at 1 km and 3 km depth, we find that particle sedimentation increased substantially with depth. Yearly organic carbon sedimentation was 0. 6 g m**- 2 at 1 km depth compared with 0. 8 g m**- 2 at 3 km.

The multichannel sea surface temperature (MCSST) data for 1981 - 1986 showed considerable interannual variability in both the position the Agulhas retroflection and the extent of the Rossby wave in the Agulhas Return Current. Pronounced interannual variation in pigment levels was found in the CZCS data for early 1979, 1982 and 1983, with highest pigment levels in early 1982. These greater pigment levels were shown to be a function of increased frontal intensity of the STC front rather than of the Agulhas front, or of SST per se: The principal interannual differences were found in the region where a strong Agulhas front occurred {{to the north of the}} STC front. The Agulhas front appeared to play a role in limiting the spatial distribution of phytoplankton pigment. Time series of level- 2 CZCS data supported the scenario of upstream Agulhas retroflection resulting in a pronounced Rossby wave in the Agulhas Return Current, and increased phytoplankton pigment levels in the STC region.

Part of the research programme was funded by the Marine Institute of Ireland and Bord Iascaigh Mhara (the Irish Sea Fisheries Board). This was specifically to develop a colorimetric headspace gas sensor to monitor the release of volatile spoilage compounds from fish samples. In our approach, the sensors reacted with target spoilage compounds to produce a measurable change in colour. Novel spectral and colour processing techniques were used to quantitatively monitor changes in the sensor response. The sensor formulation developed was optimised and the sensor response was characterised and calibrated to headspace ammonia. An experimental setup was devised for the routine screening of different fish species in parallel. The microbial populations of fish samples during spoilage were determined, and the working sensor correlated to microbial populations of fish samples tested and to the concentration of headspace spoilage compounds released {{during the course of a}} spoilage experiment. In the final section of work, a novel handheld <b>colour</b> <b>scanner</b> device was developed to enable routine measurements of colour changes to be made “on-package”.
