5000|$|The mining of {{ozokerite}} {{began in}} Galicia in the 1880s, and was formerly carried on {{by means of}} hand-labor, but in the ozokerite mines owned by the Boryslaw Actien Gesellschaft and the Galizische Kreditbank, the workings of which extend {{to a depth of}} 200 m, and 225 m, respectively, electrical power is employed for hauling, pumping and ventilating. In these mines there are the usual main shafts and galleries, the ozokerite being reached by levels driven along the strike of the deposit. The wax, as it reaches the surface, varies in purity, and, in new workings especially, only hand-picking is needed to separate the pure material. In other cases much earthy matter is mixed with the material, and then the rock or shale having been eliminated by hand-picking, the [...] "wax-stone" [...] is boiled with water in large coppers, when the pure wax rises to the surface. This is again melted without water, and the impurities are skimmed off, the material being then run into slightly conical cylindrical moulds, and thus made into blocks for the market. The crude ozokerite is refined by treatment first with sulfuric acid, and subsequently with charcoal, when the <b>ceresine</b> or cerasin of commerce is obtained. The refined ozokerite or <b>ceresine,</b> which usually has a melting-point of 61 to 78 C, is largely used as an adulterant of beeswax, and is frequently colored artificially to resemble that product in appearance.|$|E
50|$|In late 1888, {{metallic}} soaps were tried. At first a lead stearate was used, but in {{the summer}} months, these records started to sweat and decompose. In 1889, Aylsworth developed an aluminum wax, using acetate of alumina and stearic acid with sodium hydroxide added as a saponifying agent. It was found these records were much more durable. Problems arose, however, {{since there was no}} tempering agent and hot weather caused these records to decompose. Two problems contributed to this, stearic quality varied from different makers; Aylsworth purchased some from P&G and found it had too much olaic acid in it. The next cause {{of the problem is that}} all stearic acid without a tempering agent takes on moisture, and after many experiments it was found that <b>Ceresine</b> was ideal. To make the wax hard, sodium carbonate was added. Even so, a few batches of records still had some problems and became fogged. The fog problem arose from acetic acid left in the wax; this problem was solved when higher temperatures were used to make sure all the acetic acid was boiled out of the wax. As such, the records from 1889 to 1894 are a reddish-brown color due to the long cooking time. By 1896, Edison started using hydrated alumina in place of acetate of alumina. The use of hydrated alumina (sheet aluminum dissolved in a mixture of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and distilled water) made better records, and the wax could be manufactured in a shorter period of time. Using the hydrated aluminum resulted in more desirable blanks, with fewer defects and shorter production time.|$|E
5000|$|The Columbia Phonograph Company used Edison {{recording}} blanks until 1894. The North American Phonograph Company was {{dissolved in}} the fall of 1894, and Edison quit supplying blanks to Columbia, who had purchased 70,000 blanks from 1889 to 1894. Columbia was frantic to find a solution to make cylinder blanks in house, and the recipe for making Edison's wax was a well kept secret. Thomas McDonald started doing experiments with wax alloys with poor results: the records fogged or decomposed in the summer, just like the early Edison blanks. The Columbia company had a deadline to either supply recordings, or have their contracts cancelled and be sued for loss of records. Columbia resorted to attempt to steal secrets from Edison company by hiring old Edison Phonograph Works employees, such as Mr. Storms. Unfortunately for Columbia, the names of the components used by Edison were not labeled with ingredients but were instead indicated by number (i.e. 1,2,3 keeping the identities of these components a secret.) Paraffin, <b>ceresine,</b> and ozokerite all look similar, making the tempering agent even more difficult to be identified by the wax mixer. Wax mixers were given instructions on how much of the numbered components to put in the mixture, and how to process it, but no idea as to what the ingredients actually were. It took over a year for Columbia {{to come up with the}} formula for cylinders. Columbia placed an ad in the Soap Makers' Journal for a practical man to work with metallic soaps. Adolph Melzer, a soap manufacturer from Evansville, Indiana took the job. Melzer came up with a formula comparable to Edison's with the exception of the tempering agent (using cocinic acid, derived from coconut oil.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Traces {{of ancient}} human {{settlement}} {{date back to}} the Lusatian culture period (ca. 700 BC). Excavations carried out in 1996 testify to the existence of a medieval settlement in the 11th century. The first written record of the village name (in Latin Strmyeschycze major) comes from the early 14th century. The village belonged to the bishops of Kraków and was administered as part of the Sławków estates until 1790, when these became nationalized. After the Third Partition of Poland Strzemieszyce Wielkie found itself in the Prussian province of New Silesia. The first elementary school was established in 1806. Between 1807 and 1813 it found itself in the Duchy of Warsaw, and between 1815 and 1914 under Russian rule in Congress Poland. In 1848 a railway station of the Warsaw-Vienna Railway was opened, followed in 1885 by a station of the Ivangorod Railway, connecting Dęblin (Russ.: Ivangorod) and Dąbrowa. The intersection of these two important railways gave rise to industrial development of the settlement. Between the 1870s and the 1930s numerous, albeit small, coal mines (e.g. [...] "Jakub", [...] "Jakub II", [...] "Lilit", [...] "Siurpryz", [...] "Proreden") operated here. In 1883 a <b>ceresine</b> plant ("Strem") and in 1899 a superphosphate plant were established.The bishop of Kielce Augustyn Łosiński (1867-1937) founded a Roman Catholic parish in Strzemieszyce Wielkie in February 1911. From 1914 to 1918 the settlement came under Austrian occupation. Jews started to settle in Strzemieszyce Wielkie {{in the second half of}} the 19th century. In 1885 out of 2962 inhabitants 125 were Jews (4,2%). The Jewish population grew to ca. 20% in the inter-war period. During World War II Strzemieszyce Wielkie (under the German name Groß Strzemieszyce) was the seat of a German Amtsbezirk Strzemieszyce, to which also several other communities (Strzemieszyce Małe, Strzemieszyce Folwark, Kazimierz, Niemce, Porąbka) belonged. Town rights from 1954 until 1975, when Strzemieszyce Wielkie became a district of Dąbrowa Górnicza.|$|E
