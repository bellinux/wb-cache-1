40|$|The {{distinction}} between intrinsic and extrinsic value {{can be traced}} back to Plato and Aristotle. I contend that the distinction has never been properly drawn. My main task is to formulate the distinction in a way that avoids the problems of the traditional formulations. ^ After defending the traditional Moorean conception of intrinsic value against John Mackie 2 ̆ 7 s arguments from relativity and “queerness,” and against recent attacks by Elizabeth Anderson and Shelly Kagan, I attempt to define two important types of extrinsic value in terms of intrinsic value. First, I define instrumental value. The main problem with traditional definitions of instrumental value is that they fail to account for the fact that preventing something intrinsically evil from occurring seems to be just as worthwhile as bringing about something intrinsically good. I attempt to account for this fact by introducing a “contextualist” analysis of instrumental value. Next, I present and defend an analysis of <b>contributory</b> <b>value.</b> I compare <b>contributory</b> <b>value</b> with conditional intrinsic value, and present an argument to show that the notion of conditional intrinsic value faces problems that can be avoided by admitting the existence of <b>contributory</b> <b>value.</b> I then expand on the contextualist analysis of instrumental value, and provide an analysis of extrinsic value that explains what is common to instrumental and <b>contributory</b> <b>value.</b> I contend that my analysis can also account for other types of extrinsic value—for example, signatory value—and I defend my analysis against recent objections by Alastair Norcross involving the extrinsic values of actions. ^ Finally, I argue that <b>contributory</b> <b>value</b> can help to solve a current problem in environmental ethics. The problem is this: how can it be that the last member of a species is more valuable than a similar member of a flourishing species (irrespective of human interests) ? I argue (following Leibniz and Brentano) that diversity of goods increases the value of a whole; therefore, the last member of an endangered species has <b>contributory</b> <b>value</b> in virtue of its contribution to the world 2 ̆ 7 s biological diversity. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Rational {{economic}} {{decisions regarding}} {{the conservation of}} biodiversity require the consideration of all the benefits generated by this natural resource. Recently a number of categories of <b>values</b> (inherent <b>value,</b> <b>contributory</b> <b>value,</b> indirect value, infrastructure value, primary value) have been developed, especially {{in the literature of}} Ecological Economics, which, besides the individual and productive benefits of biodiversity, also include the utilitarian relevance of the ecological structure and functions of biodiversity in the, so-called, total economic value. For the question of including the ecological structure and functions of biodiversity in the total economic value it is of crucial importance to note, that these categories of values are not only terminologically different, but also relate to different ecological levels of biodiversity and – most importantly – to specific complementary relationships – between species, between elements of ecological structures and between ecological functions and their contribution to human well-being.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study the working {{principle}} {{in relation to the}} outcome of the artery ligation procedure; a treatment for hemorrhoidal disease. Hemorrhoidal artery ligation, known as HAL (hemorrhoidal artery ligation) or THD (transanal hemorrhoidal dearterialization) procedure, is a common treatment modality for hemorrhoidal disease in which a Doppler transducer is used to locate the supplying arteries that are subsequently ligated. It has been suggested that the use of the Doppler transducer does not contribute to the beneficial effect of these ligation procedures. We first aimed to evaluate the artery ligation procedure from a patient perspective. In a retrospective study the clinical status of patients, who had undergone HAL for the treatment of grade II and III hemorrhoidal disease, was investigated. Second we elucidated the vascular anatomy of the anal canal in the distal rectum and its role in the artery ligation procedure by means of an anatomical study. Finally the <b>contributory</b> <b>value</b> of the Doppler transducer in the artery ligation procedure was assessed. A randomized controlled trial (HEMARTY) was initiated for the determination of the added value of the use of Doppler during HAL. In this study patients suffering from hemorrhoidal disease grade II and III were either treated by means of the conventional HAL with or without the use of Doppler. Further the vascular anatomy of the corpus cavernosum recti in patients suffering from hemorrhoidal disease was investigated in the preoperative and postoperative situation. In conclusion may HAL be regarded as an attractive, easy to learn and perform procedure for the treatment of hemorrhoidal disease. Studies by us and others show that patients may benefit from the procedure, although most patients develop some degree of recurrence of complaints in the long term. The studies in this thesis reveal that in HAL, the <b>contributory</b> <b>value</b> of the Doppler transducer is highly overrated, to the extent that, in our opinion, it can safely be omitted. The existing literature reveals only limited attempts to define the role of HAL between all other available treatment entities. We therefore strongly support the execution of a broad and multicenter randomized trial on the effectivity of HAL in relation to other standard procedures, particularly rubber band ligation...|$|R
40|$|Recently, the Middle East {{region has}} been characterised by periods of high {{environmental}} flux. As an important {{space in the}} global economy and with a very high youth demographic, the region is a haven for consumption.

40|$|AimsTo {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} prognostic value and reproducibility of different methods of pattern of invasion scoring in oral squamous cell carcinomas. The additional prognostic value to established histopathological prognostic factors was also analysed. Methods and resultsThe study group was confined to 211 previously untreated patients who underwent surgery for low-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma between 1997 and 2008. Median follow-up was 64 months (range 0 - 193 months). Pattern of invasion was scored using five previously described methods, at random and independently, by two observers. Pattern of invasion scoring showed moderate interobserver reproducibility (Cohen's = 0. 52 - 0. 58). The predominant pattern of invasion and the summed predominant and worst pattern of invasion were independent prognosticators for locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) [hazard ratio (HR) : 2. 1, P= 0. 033 and HR 2. 2, P= 0. 024, respectively] and disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR 2. 3, P= 0. 032 and HR 2. 1, P= 0. 044, respectively) in multivariate Cox regression analyses. The Harrell's C index for proven prognostic histopathological factors was 0. 66 for LRRFS and 0. 67 for DSS. This improved to 0. 69 and 0. 73 {{with the addition of}} pattern of invasion.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the {{literature}} of Dominion and Provincial Surveys of Canada and other pertinent sources. In scope, this investigation does not include the Grenville Sub-province because of its indecisive geological relationship to the remainder of the Shield. Archean rocks are classed as such because; 1. they consist largely of vo 1 canics and illsorted sediments and when in contact with the less deformed (Algonkian Type) rocks are bound to underlie them unconformably. 2. the sediments approximate lithologically the younger Algonkian group, but are more strongly deformed. The purpose of this research is to render a summary of what is now known about the kinds and relative quantity of sediments comprising this ancient enigmatic rock assemblage. Time did not permit a more exhaustive examination of all reports published on these rocks; however, the writer believes the list of references of Appendix “A” (page 49) to be representative of that literature containing the better type of descriptive information. Thus, they are the basis of this thesis. It is hoped that paths of research as suggested subsequently will be of <b>contributory</b> <b>value</b> to our knowledge of the Archean.

40|$|This auto-ethnographic project {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the processes of how meaning in an organisational setting is created, changed, sustained and 'achieved'. Its <b>contributory</b> <b>value</b> lies in the inductive development of a 'tropological approach' to the investigation of sensemaking processes in organisations. Positioned in an interpretive-hermeneutic tradition, the major research strategy of participant observation and its supplementary techniques (e. g. qualitative interviewing) were activated to explore sense-making processes. This engagement in the field was complemented by the application of three frameworks derived from the discipline of linguistics. These were: a structuralist approach (as based on Saussure, Jakobson, Lodge), speech act theory (Austin, Searle) and discourse analysis (Fairclough). The application of the first framework to data explored the character of signs {{as well as the}} relationship between signs. The latter were defined as either metaphorical or metonymical in character. The tropes derived from these relationships, i. e. metaphor and metonymy, provided an early trajectory for further data interpretation. Naturally occurring talk, including organisational stories, talk as recorded in meetings, artifacts including written texts, buildings, equipment and geographical arrangements were analysed in terms of their metaphorical and/or metonymical significance in processes of meaning creation. The interplay of metonymies, i. e. processes on the basis of physical or causal contiguity, and metaphors, translation and interpretation processes were shown to render the experience of the organisation essentially symbolic. A third trope, irony, emerged as an important figure during the research process and was integrated into the tropological approach. Metonymy and irony are undertheorised in organisation studies. Within the second organising framework the performative value of tropes was investigated, i. e. in how far 'talk and action' form a dialectic whole. In particular, the question how organisations become active agents, who "think" and "speak" and "act" was investigated {{with the help of the}} voice metaphor, exploring the relationship between individuals, agents and principals. Different voices (new voices, fading and fluctuating voices, dissenting voices, having no voice) were investigated. Meaning, although inchoate and in perpetual flux was shown to be linked to the ability to transcend individual status and claim agency on behalf on a higher principal. Deviant meaning and interpretation were investigated as occurring in the trope irony, but also in the denial of metonymical causal linkages between signs and divergent particularisation processes within metaphorical interpretation. Finally, meaning as derived from a wider discursive environment (Higher Education environment) was investigated from a critical point of view, focusing on hegemonial processes and the manufacture of consent, which "normalised" the hidden assumptions of certain discourses by drawing on metaphorical and metonymical devices inherent in language. Irony, again, was shown to be an expression of divergent meaning interpretation. The exercise of power as well as resistance were shown to be dialectically enacted at the interstices of everyday practice. These transient, elusive processes are expressed in language, in particular the figures of speech. In sum, the suggested tropological approach shows metapho as being both constraining and emancipatory in its performative value, metonymy as being the first and foremost habitus of cultural knowledge and iron as being precariously suspended between conservatism and change. The <b>contributory</b> <b>value</b> of this approach lies in the inclusion of two tropes, metonymy and irony, which have not been sufficiently understood or theorised in organisation studies. </p...|$|R

My precautionary ecosystem health principle (PEHP) will be grounded on a weak anthropocentric approach, guided by <b>contributory</b> <b>value,</b> {{and will be}} promoted as a replacement to non-anthropocentric and intrinsic value definitions. My PEHP framework will propose an adaptive, resilient, and dynamic approach instead of relying on fixed ecological benchmarks. I will argue that health is a thick descriptor, but I will argue against it being defined intrinsically. I will establish that we receive many different benefits from ecosystems, such as ecosystem goods, services, and cultural services. I will claim that there are different ways to estimate the value we place on these ecosystem benefits without having to resort to economic pricing, such as non-excludable goods and services. Ecosystem services and cultural services {{must be taken into}} account, as they are fundamental for the functional capacity of ecosystems and can enrich our lives in non-material ways, recreational, spiritual, and psychological. I will propose that catastrophic and irreversible harm should not be used as thresholds to guide precautionary action, but a resilience approach will be more appropriate to guide the PEHP. I will propose that a post-normal scientific approach to decision-making is a more appropriate approach to take in the PEHP because it acknowledges both the scientist and public 2 ̆ 7 s opinions on risk instead of just focusing on one or the other, and allows us to evaluate the benefits of ecosystem and cultural services instead of simply overlooking them for economic benefits. Overall, my approach will contribute to the area of sustainability theory by offering a philosophical analysis of the PP and EH and by integrating them together within a holistic weak anthropocentric framework the PEHP...|$|R
40|$|Before the {{discovery}} of oil, the Libyan economy was characterized by its dependence on the agricultural sector. Oil was discovered in Libya in the late nineteen-fifties. High oil revenues provided an appropriate environment for the financing of all development projects, including agricultural projects. Although the agricultural sector in Libya has the financial and natural potential to make the agricultural sector more effective, it is confronted by many challenges that prevent its effective development. The Libyan government in the nineteenseventies and the nineteen-eighties formulated policies for agricultural development {{through a set of}} medium-term plans (Three-year Plan 1973 - 1975, Five-year Plan 1976 / 1980 and Five-year Plan 1981 - 1986). However, {{by the middle of the}} nineteen-eighties there was a change in the mechanism of these programmes and plans, to a series of annual policies. The main aim of this study was to investigate the impact of changing agricultural policy approaches on Libyan agricultural performance. A mixed methods approach was adopted that rested on the triangulation of data from stakeholders (farmers and agricultural policy-makers) and policy documents relating to the performance of the Libyan agricultural sector. The findings indicated that the performance of the agricultural sector in the period of medium term plans, achieved higher contributions to the GDP. The performance of the agricultural sector declined when policies were developed on an annual basis and the government withdrew its subsidies for the sector. The distinguishing feature of the two approaches to agricultural policies in Libya is their diverse impact on the performance of the agricultural sector. In addition, the decline of oil prices in the eighties was the main reason behind the change in approach to policy. The main <b>contributory</b> <b>value</b> of this research is that it provides for the first time an in-depth understanding of how changing policies impact on the performance of the agricultural sector in Libya. It does this by drawing attention to the consideration of the impact of policy changes on agricultural sector development. The research generates findings that are transferable to other developing countries especially those in northern Africa with economies similar to that of Libya; it also provides an opportunity for further research into other internal and external factors that impact on policy and agricultural development, especially in oil producing countries in Africa...|$|R
40|$|Statistics {{available}} from the European Commission indicate that the implementation of EC directives on the environment is a problem. There is a gap between adoption and {{transposition into national law}} as well as partial failure in implementation and enforcement. There is a concurrent identified gap in the literature on comparative implementation research addressed in this thesis, the main objective of which is to analyse the origins of the environmental implementation problem and to develop and test a model of EC environmental implementation which can be used to explain and understand the origins of the current situation. The literature suggests that implementation may be considered as the fulfilling of a dual task. First, the introduction into national law of measures adopted by the EC and second, the installation of a framework at Member State level, which sees to it that the adopted measures are applied and enforced. A model of the EC policy-making and implementation process, based on Easton's systems approach and borrowing from Sabatier and Mazmanian's work on implementation, is employed to structure the analysis. Hypotheses based on four identified composite model variables are tested against evidence from four case studies; the Drinking Water Directive and the Birds Directive in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Of the four investigated model variables, the 'degree of institutional change' shows the best correlation to the degree of implementation success. In the Netherlands a serious obstacle to implementation has been the constitutional system of that Member State. Under the threat of various legal measures against it by the Commission, the Netherlands has amended its constitutional provisions for law-making in order to speed up the process of implementing EC legislation. A similar important change has taken place in the United Kingdom, which was forced to alter its regulatory system on the supply and control of drinking water. The most significant impact of Community effort in environmental matters has been to encourage the convergence and strengthening of national regulation; non-implementation has been a stimulus for the strengthening of Community structures and generated ideas for possible future Community instruments. The model developed and tested has not only proven useful in helping structure the analysis but it has also been of some <b>contributory</b> <b>value</b> in explanation. It has enabled comparison of implementation across environmental policy sectors and across Member States, thus offering potential for further studies in this area...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} develop {{insights}} {{into the nature of}} small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) that are effective in competing internationally, over the longer term. It therefore aims to provide {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour that engenders this capability. Its <b>contributory</b> <b>value</b> lies in the development of the new perspectives which emerged from inductive theory development grounded in longitudinal data collected between 1996 - 1999. Traditionally explanations for the success of SMEs in export markets, it is suggested, have been sought in the marketing mix paradigm rooted in exchange theory. This thesis draws from a range of literature in seeking an understanding of the behaviours observed. In developing a substantive theory to explain the dynamic nature of firms that sustain their competitive effectiveness on international markets this thesis then seeks explanations from the organisational learning paradigm. This study follows the tradition of the naturalistic paradigm and as such the research was a phenomenological study of an exploratory and qualitative nature. The naturalistic paradigm recognises the importance of the subjective experiences of individuals and groups. In the verstehen tradition this study stresses the importance of the informant as the primary source of information. The aim of the inquiry was to develop an ideographic body of knowledge, the emphasis being on explanation and understanding rather than the identification of general and universal laws. The epistemological stance taken required an inductive approach to theory building. Examining the firms longitudinally was the means by which the author was able to take an holistic view of the international activities of the firms studied and focus on the change processes and challenges faced in the study period. The central proposition of this thesis is that the firms that compete effectively on international markets exhibit a positive marketing orientation, and have a strong core purpose on which is generated a clear internationally based strategic direction. It is further proposed that over a period of time, through an iterative process of strategy development, firms build a sustainable competitive advantage in their international markets and develop the ability to maintain this advantage, even when faced with hostile challenges in their international markets. Firms, it is suggested through their relationships, build a virtual structure to their international markets, which provide the means through which a knowledge of their markets is acquired, and an input is made to the strategy development process by external partners. However, it is through the dynamic processes of organisational learning that SMEs develop these capabilities and so enhance their ability to sustain a competitive advantage over a period of time...|$|R

The specific test conducted is whether condominiums and single family homes in the Salt Lake Valley have appreciated {{at the same rate}} over the past six and a half years. To test this hypothesis, a sample of 10, 134 condominium and 48, 913 house transactions was analyzed. The sales were grouped into eight geographic analysis areas. Hedonic models were used to quantify the <b>contributory</b> effect on <b>value</b> of the time of sale, age of the unit, and other significant housing characteristics. The price indices created by the hedonic models for each housing type are then compared within geographic areas and across the valley. The paper shows that condominium price appreciation is significantly below the appreciation of single family houses in seven of the eight areas examined, which represents 80 % of the sample. Valley wide regressions were then conducted utilizing geographic dummy variables for the individual analysis areas. These models indicate a strong premium for units of both housing types located in the downtown area. by John D. Billings. Thesis (S.

40|$|Background and hypothesis: Transesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TEE) {{is increasingly}} utilized for the monitoring of interventional cardiac catheterization in children. The initial nondiscriminant use is {{giving way to}} a more selective approach. The current role and usefulness of this imaging modality are described. Methods: Between 1991 and 1995, 44 patients (mean age 7. 4 ± 5 years, weight 22. 8 ± 14. 2 kg) underwent interventional cardiac catheterizations performed under TEE monitoring. The interventional procedures included (1) those involving creation, enlargement, or closure of an interatrial communication; (2) balloon dilatation of stenotic lesions; and (3) occlusion of arterial ducts. Transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring was judged to be either of great <b>value,</b> <b>contributory,</b> or of little use if the interventional procedure and choice of instrument relied heavily upon, was guided, or not affected by the information obtained from the ultrasonic investigation, respectively. Results: Transesophageal echocardiography was judged to be of great value in the monitoring of 18 (40 %) procedures involving either the creation, enlargement, or closure of interatrial communications. This included 4 transseptal punctures, 4 blade septectomies for relieving restrictive atrial septal defects (n = 3) and an enlargement of the communication between the superior and inferior chambers of the divided left atrium in cortriatriatum, and 11 closures of a secundum atrial septal defect. Only the ultrasonic monitoring could clearly visualize the interatrial partition to provide real-time guidance on the positioning of the instrument {{to carry out the}} invasive procedures. Transesophageal echocardiography provided clear images of the hinge points of the aortic and mitral valves, the dimension of the narrowed pulmonary venous pathway in patients after venous switch operation. This facilitated the choice of the correct size of the balloon for dilatation in 11 patients (24 %) and provided immediate postdilatation hemodynamic assessment. As for balloon dilation of subvalvar ventricular outflow tract obstruction (n = 3), aortic coarctation (n = 6), and occlusion of persistent arterial duct (n = 7), TEE offered no obvious advantage over fluoroscopy with angiography. The monitoring was judged to be of little value for the 16 (36 %) procedures. Conclusion: Transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring is of great value in interventional procedures involving the atrial septum and enhances interventional procedures involving obstructive lesions of the left heart in children. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} questions which {{lie at the}} heart of the ongoing debate about the value of human life. The issue is central to most bioethical dilemmas, and especially to those which arise from ongoing advancements in medical technology. Disagreement and confusion over the value and the definition of human life has precipitated the acceleration of debate on these issues in the professional literature. After an introductory chapter, the study begins, in Chapter II, by attempting to eliminate the ambiguity of the term 2 ̆ 2 human life 2 ̆ 2 by defining its different meanings relevant to this topic. Two concepts are defined, namely, 2 ̆ 2 biological life 2 ̆ 2 (defined as the presence of metabolism on a sufficiently high level of the organism as a whole) and 2 ̆ 2 personal life 2 ̆ 2 (indicated by the presence of the capacity for self-consciousness). This is followed by a discussion about valid criteria for indicating the presence of life, e. g., cardio-pulmonary function, whole-brain function, and neocortical function. Arguments supporting the validity of both cardio-pulmonary function and whole-brain function as criteria for identifying the presence of metabolism sufficient for life are presented. Chapter III discusses values, emphasizing the importance of the subject/object relationship in value situations. It is argued that human values and value judgments arise in situations where man 2 ̆ 7 s pursuit of his perfection brings him into relations with those things which promise fulfillment of his needs [...] arising from his human nature [...] and can contribute to his perfection. Chapter IV considers actual value assessments of human life in the meanings previously identified. The study concludes that personal life is an intrinsic and final, but incalculable value. Biological life, however, is a <b>contributory</b> and relational <b>value</b> to the life of the person. Mere biological life function, without relations to a 2 ̆ 2 self, 2 ̆ 2 i. e., lacking relational value, is considered according to its relations to other subjects which, generally, places it among extrinsic values. Concluding discussions in Chapter V focus on the issues of autonomy in life-and-death decisions, our attitudes toward suffering, the relationship between suffering and a person 2 ̆ 7 s concept of meaning of life, respect for all life, and the interrelatedness of all life pointing to a common purpose for mankind...|$|R
