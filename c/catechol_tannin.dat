40|$|Abstract: The dying {{properties}} of fabrics with Chaenomelis Fructus extract were studied through {{an investigation of}} the characteristic of Chaenomelis Fructus colorants, the effect of dyeing conditions (dye temperature, dyeing concentration, and times on dye uptakes), effect of mordant, effect of UV irradiation, and color change in addition, antimicrobial ability and deodorant ability were estimated. In the UV-Visible spectrum, the wavelength of maximum absorption of Chaenomelis Fructus extract was 280 nm and showed that tannin is the major pigment component. From the increase of absorbance by UV irradiation, it was assumed that <b>catechol</b> <b>tannin</b> color was developed through UV irradiation. An increased dyeing concentration resulted in a larger dye uptake. Dye uptake increased as the dyeing time and temperature increased. Chaenomelis Fructus extract showed relatively good affinity to silk than cotton. Mordant, Fe and Cu were effective to increase the dye uptake of cotton fabric in addition, the dye uptake of silk fabric mordanted with Fe and K improved. UV irradiation let the color of dyed fabrics develop regardless of the UV irradiation stage however, UV irradiation on the dyed fabric was more effective than on the extract for the color development. Dyed silk fabric showed very good antimicrobial abilities of 99. 9 % in addition, deodorant ability improved in the fabric dyed with Chaenomelis Fructus extract...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{investigations}} recorded {{in this paper}} have not resulted in {{the isolation of the}} toxic principle of the Gifblaar, Dichapetalum cymosum in a state of chemical purity, it is felt that certain valuable information has been obtained relative to the nature of this toxin. In addition, some interesting substances have been isolated from the plant in the course of chemical manipulations. These include: (1) A <b>catechol</b> <b>tannin.</b> (2) A yellow colouring matter, shown to be a methylpentoside, yielding rhamnose on hydrolysis. (3) A histidine-like base. (4) A base probably identical with choline. (5) The alkaloid trigonelline, the methyl-betaine of nicotinic acid. Various specialised methods were tried for the purification of the toxin, including: (1) Dialysis. (2) Ultrafiltration under pressures up to 80 atmospheres of nitrogen. (3) High-vacuum distillation and sublimation. (4) Continuous extraction with butyl alcohol, etc. Certain other chemical operations led {{to the conclusion that the}} following groups are definitely absent from the toxin molecule: Carboxyl –COOH; Ketonic >CO; Aldehyde –CHO; Hydroxyl –OH; Amino –NH₂; Imino >NH. The active principle almost certainly contains nitrogen and it is suggested that this may be included in some cyclic structure. It may possibly occur as in tertiary bases but the molecule, as a whole, does not evince basic characters. Preparations, still highly toxic to rabbits, have been prepared containing no protein, amino-acid, or carbohydrate material, impurities which had not before been successfully removed. The chemical stability or inertness of the toxic substance is very remarkable in view of its pronounced physiological action. Thus, it resists boiling for one hour with 1 per cent. sulphuric acid or 1 per cent. sodium hydroxide solutions; it is not oxidised by potassium permanganate or by hydrogen peroxide in the cold and it is thermostable. In view of this stability and the absence of any substance known to combine with or precipitate the toxin, the hope of finding any specific prophylactic or curative substance for use in Gifblaar poisoning becomes very remote indeed.

40|$|Objectives: Ticks are vectors {{of several}} diseases, of which many are {{zoonosis}} transmissible to humans. The use of Tephrosia leafs’ extract as a low cost acaricide is spreading among farmers in central Kenya. Materials and Methods: The present study’s {{aim is to}} inventory endogenous control methods against dogs’ ticks among which Rhipicephalus sanguineus, in the Municipality of Abomey-Calavi. From September to October 2013, a survey was made on forty randomly selected breeders and ticks samples were collected on forty dogs. The web platform, www. epicollect. net, {{was used for the}} survey. In total, 77. 5 % (n= 40) of examined dogs were infested with ticks Results: Three species of ticks were identified: Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Haemaphysalis leachi, and Amblyomma variegatum. They were found on 77. 5 %, 17. 5 %, and 15 % of examined dogs, respectively. The numerical abundance of the three species was 87. 06 %, 11. 9 %, and 1. 03 %, respectively. The average number of ticks per animal was 16. 83 ± 5. 04, 2. 3 ± 1. 64, and 0. 2 ± 0. 08 for Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Haemaphysalis leachi, and Amblyomma variegatum, respectively. Farmers used manual diptank (67. 5 %), plant ash (37. 5 %), petroleum (12. 5 %), motor oil (2. 50 %), and sea water (7. 5 %) to fight against ticks. Conclusions: The phytochemical screening of the leafy stem’s powder of Tephrosia vogelii revealed the presence of <b>catechol</b> <b>tannins,</b> saponins, sugars, leuco-anthocyanins, polyterpenes, and sterols. A 100 % larval mortality was observed at the concentration of 20 % the ethanolic extract of the leafy stem of Tephrosia vogelii. The LC 50 of this ethanolic extract against Rhipicephalus sanguineus larvae was equal to 2. 6 %...|$|R
30|$|Leather {{has been}} used since ancient and medieval times for many {{purposes}} [13 – 15]. The corium is the raw material used for leather manufacturing which consists of a tight network of collagen fibres and fibrils [16]. Animal skin has been tanned through the ages using different tannages such as vegetable tannins [17, 18]. Vegetable tanning {{is based on the}} treatment of animal skins using natural sources of condensed <b>tannins</b> (<b>catechols)</b> found in acacia, mimosa and pine, as well as hydrolysable tannins (pyrogallols) such as oak wood, gulls and sumac leaves [1, 16 – 19]. Animal skin collagen protein interacts with the large molecules in vegetable tannins which transform the skin into leather with greater stability and resistance to microbial attack, comparing to non-treated skins [16].|$|R
30|$|Ashoka (Saraca asoca (Roxb.), De. Wild) {{belonging}} to family Fabaceae {{is one of}} the most legendary and sacred tree of India. It is commonly called as Ashoka, Sita ashoka, Karkeli (Sanskrit), Sita ashok, Ashoka (Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi), Asogam (Tamil), Oshok (Bengali), Ashokmu, Vanjulamu (Telugu), Asokam (Malayalam), Alshth, Achenge, Kenkalimara, Ashokadamara (Kannada). The word Ashoka literally means “without sorrow”, a reference to this bark’s reputation for keeping a woman healthy and youthful (Nayak et al. 2009; Pradhan et al. 2009). It is distributed in Central and East Himalaya, East Bengal, Burma, Western Peninsula, Ceylon and Malaya. In India, it is found in the foothills of central and eastern Himalayas, northern plains as well as in west coast of the subcontinent (Preeti et al. 2012). It is also cultivated in tropical gardens as an ornamental tree for its evergreen beautiful foliage and attractive flowers. Apart from this, the tree also has many health benefits and has long been used in traditional Indian medicine as a key ingredient in various therapies and cures. This tree is closely associated with Indian cultural traditions. Bark, flower, leaves, roots and seeds of ashoka are used as medicine. The bark contains <b>tannin,</b> <b>catechol,</b> flavanoides, sterol, glucosides, alkaloids, other organic calcium compounds (Kirtikar and Basu 1981), which contributes to its medicinal qualities as ‘female tonic’. Bark is extremely useful in gynecological problems, especially in the treatment of menstrual disorders associated with excessive bleeding, congestion, pain, dysmenorrhea, abdominal pain, and uterine spasms. It is also used for leucorrhea and has an astringent but stimulative effect on endometrium and ovarian tissues (Nadkarni 1976; Nudrat and Usha 2005). The bark is used to cure dyspepsia, dysentery, piles, sores and irregular menstruation, whereas the dried flowers are used for treatment of syphilis, hemorrhagic, diabetes and dysentery. It also helps to get rid of the toxins from the body and is effective in purifying the blood naturally and in preventing skin allergies. Seeds are used to treat bone fracture and vesicle calculi. The plant is used in the treatment of dyspepsia, indigestion, blood disorders, tumours etc. (Kirtikar and Basu 1981). There are various indigenous preparations available with Ashoka as a major constituent, of which the important ones include Ashokarishta, Ashokaghrita, Ashoka kwath (Ghose 1984; Pradhan et al. 2009).|$|R
