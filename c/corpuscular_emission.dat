5000|$|Towards {{the middle}} of the 20th century, roentgens were used for the purpose of {{radiation}} protection. This replaced earlier practices that relied on time, film exposure, or fluorescence. The National Council on Radiation Protection established the first formal dose limit in 1931 as 0.1 roentgen per day. The International X-ray and Radium Protection Committee, now known as the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) soon followed with a limit of 0.2 roentgen per day in 1934. In 1950, the ICRP reduced their recommended limit to 0.3 roentgen per week for whole-body exposure. The International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) took over the definition of the roentgen in 1950, defining it as [...] "the quantity of X or γ-radiation such that the associated <b>corpuscular</b> <b>emission</b> per 0.001293 gram of air produces, in air, ions carrying 1 electrostatic unit of quantity of electricity of either sign." [...] The 3 MeV cap was no longer part of the definition, but the degraded usefulness of this unit at high beam energies was mentioned in the accompanying text. In the meantime, the new concept of roentgen equivalent man (rem) had been developed. Starting in 1957, the ICRP began to publish their recommendations in terms of rem, and the roentgen fell into disuse. The medical imaging community still has a need for ionization measurements, but they gradually converted to using C/kg as legacy equipment was replaced. The ICRU recommended redefining the roentgen to be exactly 2.58 × 10−4 C/kg in 1971.|$|E

30|$|But the {{geomagnetic}} field {{is not only}} relevant for understanding the solid earth. The {{geomagnetic field}} interacts with the varying solar wind and thereby creates the ever-changing magnetosphere. Solar-terrestrial science has attracted much attention during recent years, among scientists {{as well as in}} the public. The magnetosphere and the upper atmosphere in the polar regions are the locations where the effects of the variable Sun are most clearly seen. At present, our understanding of the global processes that determine the coupled interaction between the electromagnetic and <b>corpuscular</b> <b>emissions</b> from the Sun and the neutral and ionized species in the Earth’s environment is too poor to predict the response of the system to changes in the solar output. As a consequence, several international research programs have been initiated to improve our knowledge of the solar-terrestrial system. The European Space Agency’s Swarm mission—at the time of writing literally on the launch pad—represents the most advanced monitor of the near Earth global magnetic field and its variations.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} solar {{planetary}} relationships are directed toward exploring how far {{out from the}} sun one could observe solar cycle variations. A positive solar Jovian relationship is suggested from a Chree superposed epoch study of {{the intensity of the}} great red spot of Jupiter over a period of about six solar cycles. The characteristic double maxima observed in the solar cycle variation is common to other observations of solar events in the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona; radio and <b>corpuscular</b> <b>emissions</b> from the sun; cosmic ray intensity and geomagnetic activity. The same method of analysis adopted for the study of luminosity changes of the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune indicates that the fluctuations of luminosity follow the single maximum solar cycle represented by sunspot numbers. In conjunction with changes of upper atmospheric density and temperature, it is suggested that the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission from the sun may be connected with luminosity changes. A method of distinguishing between phenomena related to solar wind and those related to solar EUV is presented...|$|R
