50|$|To allow {{mid-infrared}} observations {{within the}} JWST, the MIRI instrument has an additional cooling system.

One source of heat is the left-over heat of the spacecraft, but another is the spacecraft's own electronics, some of which are close to the actual instruments to process data from observations. Most of the electronics are in the much warmer spacecraft bus, but some of the electronics needed to be much closer, and great lengths were taken to reduce the heat they produce. By reducing how much heat the electronics make on the cold side, then less heat needs to be removed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{patented}} US 8432048 B1, hybrid engine, is a turbine-electric {{transmission system}} {{that can be used}} to power warships, airplanes, and power plants. The gas turbine engine includes a compressor, a combustor, and a turbine which are necessary to harness mechanical energy. Inside the gas turbine engine air is taken in and compressed in the <b>cold</b> <b>section</b> of the engine, and brought to a higher pressure. Fuel is then sprayed in the air and ignites it so the combustion generates a high-temperature flow. The heated, high-pressure gas enters a turbine, where it expands down to the exhaust pressure, producing a shaft work output in the process. The exhaust is fed into the power turbine used to power an output shaft for whatever desired application. The power turbine is also connected to the electric generator, which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The electric generator driven by the power turbine charges the battery needed in order to drive the motor that supplies compressed air into the combustor.|$|E

25|$|The {{larger the}} {{temperature}} {{difference between the}} hot and <b>cold</b> <b>sections</b> of a Stirling engine, the greater the engine's efficiency. The heat sink is typically the environment the engine operates in, at ambient temperature. In the case of medium to high power engines, a radiator is required to transfer {{the heat from the}} engine to the ambient air. Marine engines have the advantage of using the cool ambient sea, lake or river water which is typically cooler than ambient air. In the case of combined heat and power systems, the engine's cooling water is used directly or indirectly for heating purposes, raising efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|Intermittent-use: There is a {{short delay}} (1-3 seconds) between when the water begins to flow and when the heater's flow {{detector}} activates the heating elements or gas burner. In the case of continuous-use applications (showers, baths, washing machines) {{this is not an}} issue as the heater never stops heating. However, for intermittent-use applications (i.e., turning off/on a hot water faucet at a sink) this can result in initially hot water, followed by a small amount of cold water as the heater re-activates, followed again by hot water. This is particularly an issue if hot water pipes are poorly insulated. The user experience is that after initially getting hot water flowing, the user turns off the valve and then a short time later turns the valve back on again. Hot water starts flowing once again at the valve from the hot water already in the piping, but at the same time, some heaters must let some amount of cold water into the piping during the reactivation time. Some time later (depending on the length of piping from the tank to the valve) this <b>cold</b> <b>section</b> of water arrives at the sink, followed shortly thereafter by hot water again. The initial thought of the user can be that the heater is failing intermittently.|$|E
