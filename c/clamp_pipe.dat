50|$|Both of the {{transmission}} effects noted above may emanate either from building occupants or from building mechanical {{systems such as}} elevators, plumbing systems or heating, ventilating and air conditioning units. In some cases it is merely necessary to specify the best available quieting technology in selecting such building hardware. In other cases shock mounting of systems to control vibration may be in order. In the case of plumbing systems there are specific protocols developed, especially for water supply lines, to create isolation <b>clamping</b> of <b>pipes</b> within building walls. In the case of central air systems, {{it is important to}} baffle any ducts that could transmit sound between different building areas.|$|R
50|$|When the nut is tightened, the ferrule is {{compressed}} {{between the}} nut and the receiving fitting; {{the ends of}} the ferrule are <b>clamped</b> around the <b>pipe,</b> and the middle of the ferrule bows away from the pipe, making the ferrule effectively thicker. The result is that the ferrule seals the space between the pipe, nut, and receiving fitting, thereby forming a tight joint.|$|R
50|$|Trim {{chains and}} shackles, or {{turnbuckles}} and <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps,</b> typically connect the lift {{lines of a}} line set to the batten they support. Those connections facilitate minor adjustments to, trim, the effective length of a lift line. By trimming the lift lines, loads are more evenly distributed to them. Turnbuckles are moused (secured against free rotation) to prevent the jaws from slowly unscrewing over time due to vibrations incurred during normal use.|$|R
50|$|Wrenches and {{applications}} using wrenches or devices that needed wrenches, such as <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps</b> and suits of armor, {{have been noted}} by historians {{as far back as}} the 15th century. Adjustable coach wrenches for the odd-sized nuts of wagon wheels were manufactured in England and exported to North America in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The mid 19th century began to see patented wrenches which used a screw to narrowing or widening the jaws, including patented monkey wrenches.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pipe</b> <b>clamps</b> serve {{a similar}} purpose to bar clamps but are {{generally}} {{less expensive to}} purchase and have a versatility derived from {{the ability to use}} a variety of lengths of pipe to suit ones needs. The same clamp heads might be switched over from a two-foot length of pipe to a twelve-foot length as the project at hand dictates. Having threads {{at both ends of the}} pipe also allows the use of pipe couplings, joining two lengths of pipe to extend the length of the clamp.|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of axial tension on the {{vibration}} of a single-span elastomeric <b>pipe</b> <b>clamped</b> at both ends conveying fluid has been carried out both experimentally and theoretically. A new mathematical model using a penalty function technique and the method of kinematic correction and fictitious loads has been developed. The influence of flowing fluid and axial tension on natural frequencies and mode shapes of the system has been described using this model and compared with experimental observations. Linear and non-linear dynamic response of the harmonically excited pipe has also been investigated for varying flow velocities and initial axial tensions...|$|R
50|$|In woodwork, a <b>pipe</b> <b>clamp</b> uses clamp heads {{produced}} commercially {{by numerous}} manufacturers. They {{are available in}} various diameter sizes, commonly ½”or ¾”, suited to the same diameter piping. The pipe is usually threaded on both ends. One head is fixed on the pipe by spinning it onto standard pipe threads. This head includes the screw mechanism for tightening the clamp. The other, movable, head slides onto {{the other end of}} the pipe. This head has a mechanism, often a series of movable “clutches” which allow it to slide along the pipe when setting up the clamping operation but which lock onto the <b>pipe</b> when <b>clamping</b> pressure is applied.|$|R
50|$|Most catwalks {{have several}} battens (pipes) that {{lighting}} fixtures may be attached to. Lights are usually attached by a C-Clamp or a hook <b>clamp</b> around the <b>pipes.</b> In {{addition to this}} primary attachment, fixtures generally have an additional safety cable attaching them to the catwalk, so that if the clamp or bolt gives way, the safety cable will catch the light. This is used because the lights are generally very expensive and heavy, but mainly to protect the audience members and performers from the possibility of fixtures falling down from the catwalks. Catwalks often include a platform for a spotlight operator to work from.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} simple {{theoretical}} model of how pulsed ultrasound is attenuated by the particles in a solid/liquid flow. The theoretical model is then used to predict the attenuation of sound, given the mass fraction, the density, and the size distribution of the solid particles. The model is verified experimentally for suspensions of 0 – 10 % (by mass) Dolomite ((Ca,Mg) CO 3) particles and water. The experimental {{results show that the}} attenuation of sound due to particles varies linearly with mass fraction, and that the proposed theoretical model can be used to predict this attenuation.

50|$|Drops may be hung {{by various}} means. Often made of muslin {{which has been}} sized and painted, the top may be pressed between two pieces of lumber (a batten) and <b>clamped</b> to a <b>pipe,</b> with a pipe or chain through a hem pocket at the bottom giving it weight to prevent flapping. Some may be grommeted along the top and tied to the pipe with {{tie-line}} (usually drapery cord nowadays). A time-honored method of hanging a drop is the roll-drop, in which {{the bottom of the}} drop is attached to a round batten. The drop is rolled onto it from the back, and is deployed by rope rigged through blocks (pulleys) to be pulled from offstage to release the tension holding the batten up, thus unrolling it slowly until completely unfurled.|$|R
50|$|Rigid support can be {{provided}} either from bottom or top. In case of bottom supports generally a stanchion or <b>Pipe</b> <b>Clamp</b> Base is used. It can be simply kept on steel structure for only rest type supports. To simultaneously restrict in another direction separate plate or Lift up Lug can be used. A pipe anchor is a rigid support that restricts movement in all three orthogonal directions and all three rotational directions, i.e. restricting al the {{6 degrees of freedom}} This usually is a welded stanchion that is welded or bolted to steel or concrete. In case of anchor which is bolted to concrete, a special type of bolt is required called Anchor Bolt, which is used to hold the support with concrete. In this type of support, normal force and friction force can become significant. To alleviate the frictional effect Graphite Pad or PTFE plates are used when required.|$|R
40|$|A {{device is}} {{disclosed}} for sealing and clamping a cylindrical element {{which is to}} be attached to an object such as a wall, a pressurized vessel or another cylindrical element. The device includes a gland having an inner cylindrical wall, which is threaded at one end and is attached at a bendable end to a deformable portion, which in turn is attached to one end of a conical cantilever structure. The other end of the cantilever structure connects at a bendable area to one end of an outer cylindrical wall. The opposite end of cylindrical wall terminates in a thickened portion, the radially outer surface of which is adapted to accommodate a tool for rotating the gland. The terminal end of cylindrical wall also includes an abutment surface, which is adapted to engage a seal, which in turn engages a surface of a receiver. The receiver further includes a threaded portion for engagement with the threaded portion of gland whereby a tightening rotation of gland relative to receiver will cause relative movement between cylindrical walls and of gland. This movement causes a rotation of the conical structure and thus a bending action at bending area and at the bending end of the upper end of inner cylindrical wall. These rotational and bending actions result in a forcing of the deformable portion radially inwardly so as to contact and deform a pipe. This forcible contact creates a seal between gland and <b>pipe,</b> and simultaneously <b>clamps</b> the <b>pipe</b> in position...|$|R
40|$|When an {{offshore}} oil field completed {{and put into}} production, new subsea pipelines and the new cable need to be established. Cable protection <b>pipe</b> <b>clamp</b> is used to fix cable protection pipe on the jacket.

40|$|Experimental {{research}} {{is carried out}} to reveal the static frictional behaviors of rubber pipe contact systems. This {{research is}} motivated by deep water pipe-laying operations where rubber blocks are used to <b>clamp</b> the <b>pipe</b> to supply sufficient static friction. Within this context, a friction testing instrument {{has been designed to}} mimic a situation of the beginning of the pipe-laying installation. Using this instrument, the maximum static friction forces (F) of a rubber pipe contact system are tested. The results show that the ultimate values of the static frictions fluctuate due to the increasing rate of the tangential load (FT). The evolution of contact between rubber and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) pipe is observed to identify the formation and propagation of the folds within the apparent contact area. In addition, it is confirmed that the evolution of contact is influenced by the folds and creep of the rubber surface. The creep deformation takes primary effect in accelerating the separation of the interfaces of contact during relative high normal loads (20, 30, 40 N) and low increasing rate of FT; whereas for all of the testing normal loads (10 – 40 N), the propagation of the folds release the energy which is stored in the interface of rubber when the increasing rate of FT is high. Therefore, the fluctuation of the maximum static friction of the contact system can be regarded as a consequence of interaction of the creep and folds. Furthermore, the instability of the coefficient of static friction in this test has been examined, and it indicated that the creep and folds could affect the static friction distinctly within a certain range of a normal load. This research is beneficial for arranging appropriate normal loads and laying speeds to avoid pipes slipping during a pipe-laying operation...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion {{damage in}} {{inaccessible}} regions presents a significant {{challenge to the}} petrochemical industry, and determining the remaining wall thickness is important to establish the remaining service life. Guided wave tomography is one solution to this and involves transmitting Lamb waves through the area of interest and, subsequently, using the received signals to reconstruct a thickness map of the remaining wall thickness. This avoids the need to access all points on the surface, making the technique well suited to inspection for areas with restricted access. The influence of these areas onto the ability to detect and size surface conditions, such as corrosion damage, using guided wave tomography is assessed. For that, a guided wave tomography system is employed, {{which is based on}} low-frequency A 0 Lamb waves that are excited and detected with two arrays of electromagnetic acoustic transducers. Two different defect depths are considered with different contrasts relative to the nominal wall thickness, both of which are smoothly varying and well-defined. The influence of areas with restricted surface access, support locations, <b>pipe</b> <b>clamps,</b> and STOPAQ(R) coatings is experimentally tested, and their influence assessed through comparison to a baseline reconstruction without the respective restriction in place, demonstrating only a small influence on the detected value of the remaining wall thickness...|$|R
