5|$|During trials, Delaware was run at {{full speed}} for 24 hours {{straight}} to prove that her machinery <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> stress. She was the first American battleship to achieve the feat. Late in 1910, Delaware sailed to Europe, followed by a trip to South America early in 1911. She made a further two voyages to Europe in 1912 and 1913, {{before returning to the}} US Atlantic Fleet for training exercises that were conducted in the western Atlantic and Caribbean. Delaware took part in the Second battle of Vera Cruz in April–May 1914.|$|E
5|$|RZA then financed and {{directed}} a short martial arts film called Wu-Tang vs. the Golden Phoenix featuring Hong Kong-based, kung-fu-trained actors. When he and Roth pitched The Man with the Iron Fists to producers, RZA used the short film {{to prove that}} he <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> martial arts action and be trusted to take on his first directing role. On May 7, 2010, Universal Pictures announced it had agreed to finance and distribute the film, which Roth and Strike Entertainment's Marc Abraham and Eric Newman would produce. The producers gave RZA a $20 million budget.|$|E
5|$|Despite the passed balls, Wilhelm won the American League ERA {{title with}} a 2.19 ERA. During the 1960 season, Orioles manager Paul Richards devised a larger mitt so his {{catchers}} <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> knuckleball. Richards was well equipped with starting pitchers during that year. By {{the middle of}} the season, he said that eight of his pitchers could serve as starters. Wilhelm started 11 of the 41 games in which he appeared. He earned an 11–8 record, a 3.31 ERA and seven saves. He only started one game the following year, but he was an All-Star, registered 18 saves and had a 2.30 ERA.|$|E

5|$|During the revolt, {{the ships}} were noted by many {{observers}} {{to be well}} handled, despite a previous belief that the Brazilian Navy was incapable of effectively operating the ships even before being split by a rebellion. João Cândido Felisberto ordered all liquor thrown overboard, and discipline on the ships was recognized as exemplary. The 4.7-inch guns were often used for shots over the city, but the 12-inch guns were not, {{which led to a}} suspicion among the naval officers that the rebels were incapable of using the weapons. Later research and interviews indicate that Minas Geraes guns were fully operational, and while São Paulos could not be turned after salt water contaminated the hydraulic system, British engineers still on board the ship after the voyage from the United Kingdom were working on the problem. Still, historians have never ascertained how well the mutineers <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> ships.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 5 runs on version 1.4 of Capcom's MT Framework {{engine and}} scenes were {{recorded}} by motion capture. It {{was the first}} video game to use a virtual camera system, which allowed the developers to see character movements in real time as the motion-capture actors recorded. Actors Reuben Langdon, Karen Dyer and Ken Lally portrayed Chris Redfield, Sheva Alomar and Albert Wesker respectively. Dyer also voiced Alomar, while Redfield's voice was performed by Roger Craig Smith. Dyer's background training in circus skills helped her win the role of Alomar, as Capcom were searching for someone who <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> physical skills her motion capture required. She performed her own stunts, and worked in production on the game for over a year, sometimes working 14 hours a day. All of the human character motions were based on motion capture, while the non-human characters in the game were animated by hand.|$|E

25|$|The team build-up, {{headed by}} the Spacecraft Operations Manager, started about 4 years before launch.

25|$|Along {{with the}} cramped site, there were doubts that the {{downtown}} site <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> new Boeing 747. Jets {{had to make}} steep climbs and descents to avoid the downtown skyscrapers on the 200-ft (60-m) Missouri River bluffs at Quality Hill, east of the approach course {{a mile or two}} south of {{the south end of the}} runway, and downtown Kansas City was in the flight path for takeoffs and landings, resulting in a constant roar downtown. Mid-Continent was surrounded by open farm land.|$|E
25|$|Speculation ignited that Ponting was an {{outsider}} {{to join the}} Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Despite Ponting's reluctance to weigh into the debate, Tasmanian coach Greg Shipperd thought he <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> experience. The selectors ended up choosing Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August–September 1993. Australian success was limited, with only several wins. No batsman scored a century, despite Ponting reaching 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the aggregates, behind Langer.|$|E
25|$|Early {{versions}} of Usenet used Duke's A News software, designed {{for one or}} two articles a day. Matt Glickman and Horton at Berkeley produced an improved version called B News that <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> rising traffic (about 50 articles a day as of late 1983). With a message format that offered compatibility with Internet mail and improved performance, it became the dominant server software. C News, developed by Geoff Collyer and Henry Spencer at the University of Toronto, was comparable to B News in features but offered considerably faster processing. In the early 1990s, InterNetNews by Rich Salz was developed {{to take advantage of the}} continuous message flow made possible by NNTP versus the batched store-and-forward design of UUCP. Since that time INN development has continued, and other news server software has also been developed.|$|E

25|$|Don Lash and Louis Zamperini dead-heated in the 5000 meters; originally, Lash {{was ruled}} {{to be the}} sole winner, but after photo-finish review the result was changed to a tie. Lash (who had already {{qualified}} in the 10,000 meters) was the early leader, but slowed down to support his Indiana teammate Tom Deckard. When Deckard's place {{in the top three}} was clear, Lash resumed running his own race, battling with Zamperini for victory. In the 3000-meter steeplechase Harold Manning broke Volmari Iso-Hollo's world best of 9:09.4; second-time Olympians Joe McCluskey and Glen Dawson took the next spots. The warm weather, with temperatures of up to , was not conducive to fast distance running; Manning noted he had worked in even hotter conditions and <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> heat. As the steeplechase did not become an official world record event until 1954, Manning's time was only ratified as a national record.|$|E
500|$|While the Mets had {{appeared}} uncertain whether Davis <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure of the}} major leagues as spring training ended, by mid-May—just a month after calling {{him up to the}} majors—they moved him to the cleanup spot in the batting order.

500|$|Governor Cary Hardee was on standby, {{ready to}} order National Guard troops in to {{neutralize}} the situation. Despite his message to the sheriff of Alachua County, Walker informed Hardee by telegram {{that he did not}} fear [...] "further disorder" [...] and urged the governor not to intervene. [...] The governor's office monitored the situation, in part because of intense Northern interest, but Hardee would not activate the National Guard without Walker's request. Walker insisted he <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> situation; records show that Governor Hardee took Sheriff Walker's word and went on a hunting trip.|$|E

[...] Hammerstein and Rodgers' doubts about whether Lawrence <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> <b>the</b> part were assuaged by the sheer force of her acting. [...] James Poling, a writer for Collier's who was allowed to attend the rehearsals, wrote of Lawrence preparing [...] "Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?": ...|$|E
500|$|After Gram Parsons' departure, McGuinn and Hillman {{decided to}} recruit noted session guitarist Clarence White as a {{full-time}} member of the band in late July 1968.

[...] Shortly after his induction into the band, White began to express dissatisfaction with drummer Kevin Kelley and soon persuaded McGuinn and Hillman to replace him with Gene Parsons (no relation to Gram), who White had previously played with in the country rock band Nashville West.|$|E
