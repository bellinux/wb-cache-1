25|$|After a disk is inserted, a catch or lever at {{the front}} of the drive is {{manually}} lowered to prevent the disk from accidentally emerging, engage the spindle <b>clamping</b> <b>hub,</b> and in two-sided drives, engage the second read/write head with the media. In some 5¼-inch drives, insertion of the disk compresses and locks an ejection spring which partially ejects the disk upon opening the catch or lever. This enables a smaller concave area for the thumb and fingers to grasp the disk during removal. Newer 5¼-inch drives and all 3½-inch drives automatically engage the spindle and heads when a disk is inserted, doing the opposite with the press of the eject button. On Apple Macintosh computers with built-in floppy drives, the ejection button is replaced by software controlling an ejection motor which only does so when the operating system no longer needs to access the drive. The user could drag the image of the floppy drive to the trash can on the desktop to eject the disk. In the case of a power failure or drive malfunction, a loaded disk can be removed manually by inserting a straightened paper clip into a small hole at the drive's front panel, just as one would do with a CD-ROM drive in a similar situation.|$|E
40|$|The coupled free-free {{modes of}} the 55 M LMSS antenna {{configuration}} are shown. They were determined using modal synthesis. Reflector modes <b>clamped</b> at the <b>hub</b> were calculated adopting the efficient cyclic symmetry technique. Similarly, <b>clamped</b> <b>hub</b> modes of the offset boom structure were calculated. The modes {{of the two}} substructures were then combined {{through the process of}} modal synthesis {{on the assumption that the}} interface at the hub structure is rigid thus satisfying statically determinate matching conditions. For attitude control purposes, only modes associated with symmetric components zero and one involve net motions of the center of gravity of the reflector. This condition restricts the set of admissible eigenfunctions for modal synthesis. Modes with symmetric components higher than one are excited only by forces acting on the ribs. These modes are totally uncoupled from the boom dynamics...|$|R

40|$|As small {{form factor}} (one-inch and smaller) hard disk drives are widely used in {{portable}} consumer appliances and gadgets, their mechanical robustness is of greater concern. In the previous work, {{it is found that}} when the disk is more tightly clamped, it helps to decrease the shock response of the disk and then avoid the head slap. In this paper, the real boundary condition of the disk for a {{small form factor}} hard disk drive from Seagate is investigated numerically. The disk is clamped between the <b>clamp</b> and the <b>hub.</b> The shock response of the disk under a half-sine acceleration pulse is simulated by using the finite element method. In the finite element model, both contact between disk and clamp and contact between disk and hub are considered. According to the simulation results, how to decrease the shock response of the disk is suggested...|$|R
