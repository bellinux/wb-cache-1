40|$|Microbial {{biomineralisation}} of iron {{often results}} in a biomass that is magnetic and can be separated from water systems by {{the application of a}} magnetic field. Magnetotactic bacteria form magnetic membrane bound crystals within their structure, generally of magnetite. In nature, this enables magnetotactic bacteria to orientate themselves with respect to the local geomagnetic field. The bacteria then migrate with flagellar driven motion towards their preferred environment. This property has been harnessed to produce a process in which metal loaded magnetotactic bacteria can be recovered from a waste stream. This process is known as orientation magnetic separation. Several methods exist which permit the unique magnetic properties of individual magnetotactic bacteria to be studied, such as U-turn analysis, transmission electron microscopy and single wire cell studies. In this work an extension of U-turn analysis was developed. The bacteria were rendered non-motile by the addition of specific metal ions and the resulting 'flip time' which occurs during a field reversal enabled the magnetic moment of individual bacteria to be determined. This method proved to be much faster and more accurate than previous methods. For a successful process to be developed, large scale culturing of magnetotactic bacteria is required Experiments showed that culture vessel geometry was an important factor for high-density growth. Despite intensive studies reproducible culturing at volumes exceeding one litre was not achieved. This work showed that numerous metal ions rendered magnetotactic bacteria non-motile at concentrations below 10 ppm. Sequential adaptation raised typical levels to in excess of 100 ppm for a number of ions. such as zinc and tin. However, specific ions. such as copper or nickel, remained motility inhibiting at lower concentrations. To achieve separation using orientation magnetic separation, motile, field susceptible MTB are required. Despite successful adaptation, the range of motility inhibiting ions is such that MTB cannot be envisaged for general wastewater applications. Radionucleide studies were undertaken targeting a niche application where this metal ion restriction would not apply. Liquid scintillation and #gamma#-ray counting measurements indicated that magnetotactic bacteria accumulate high levels of both plutonium and mercury. A number of both static and flow recovery separators for magnetotactic bacteria were developed. Statistical models predicting the behaviour of these separators were compared to measured results. These comparisons highlighted the problems of 'wash off' of accumulated bacteria in separators where flow was present. The most successful of the flow recovery designs - the <b>channel</b> <b>separator</b> - was then tested using a simulated effluent that contained plutonium. The results confirmed both previous radioisotope uptake studies and separator test results. The <b>channel</b> <b>separator</b> design was enhanced by the introduction of wire arrays into the separation chamber. Orientation magnetic separation in these hybrid-type separators was used to accumulate the biomass and the magnetic gradients generated by the wire arrays to retain the bacteria on the separator walls. These separators achieved increases in efficiency of up to 300 % compared with the <b>channel</b> <b>separator.</b> In summary, this thesis describes a successful separation process for the recovery of motile MTB. However, to apply this separator approach to the suggested radioisotope application would require successful large scale culturing.

40|$|Orientation {{magnetic}} separation (OMS) represents a simple method that permits motile, field-susceptible magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) {{to be separated}} from water. Such an approach can be used to decontaminate polluted water through uptake of contaminants by the bacteria and their subsequent removal by the application of magnetic fields. In OMS, a separation channel through which an MTB culture is flowing is subjected to a magnetic field perpendicular to the flow direction. The bacteria "sense" the magnetic field, orientating themselves parallel to the field lines and then swim to the channel sides where they accumulate. The fluid flow through such a standard separation channel has been shown to cause dislodgement of accumulated bacteria. To reduce this effect, a new approach has been developed utilizing magnetic gradients to retain the bacteria at the walls of the separator. A study comparing the operation of a standard <b>channel</b> <b>separator</b> with three new designs containing nickel wire matrices has been carried out. The resultant separation efficiencies and the effect on separation of varying both the flow rate and the applied magnetic field are described. The new separators enhance the separation efficiency by up to 300 % over the standard separator...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of free-breathing polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) was studied experimentally {{and the effect}} of the cathode separator structure on the cell performance was investigated. Two types of cathode separators were used for a cell with an 18 cm 2 active area: an open type with parallel rectangular open-slits and a channel type with straight vertical channels with open ends. The polarization curves, cell impedance, and contact pressure distribution of the separators were measured with each type of cathode structure. The result showed {{that it is difficult to}} realize a uniform contact pressure across the cell layers for the open type separator, and this results in higher contact resistance and poorer cell performance than the <b>channel</b> type <b>separator.</b> The <b>channel</b> type <b>separator</b> can maintain a low contact resistance, and the cell performance is strongly affected by the natural convection inside the channel. Optimization of the channel design of the <b>channel</b> type <b>separator</b> achieves good performance and this type of separator is superior for a free-breathing PEMFC.

A method for simultaneous measurements of the local current density across the reaction area and direct observation of the phenomena in the cell are developed. Experimental results comparing separator types indicate the effect of shortcut flow in the gas diffusion layer (GDL) under the land areas of serpentine separators, and also show the potential of straight <b>channel</b> <b>separators</b> to achieve a relatively-uniform current density distribution. To evaluate shortcut flows under the land areas of serpentine separators, a simple circuit model of the gas flow is presented. The analysis shows that slight variations in oxygen concentration caused by the shortcut flows under the land areas affect the local and overall current density distributions. It is also shown that the establishment of gas paths under the water in channels filled with condensed water is effective for stable operation at low flow rates of air in the straight channels...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to find the optimal dimensions of rectangular plate-type micro-separators in order to enhance the continuous separation of immiscible liquids. The main structure of the separators contains two plates: a hydrophobic (PTFE) upper plate and a hydrophilic (stainless steel) bottom plate which formed the contact surfaces for the fluids in the channel. The devices have two outlets, one for the aqueous phase and the other for the organic phase enabling the continuous separation and withdrawal of the separated phases. Demulsification has been carried out using Shellsol/water emulsion in the presence of a non-ionic surfactant (Teen 80). The separation efficiency is investigated as a function of micro-separator sizes, channel depths, flow rates and plate configurations. The major parameter that controls the destabilization mechanism is the ratio between the droplet size and the channel depth. When the size of the dispersed droplets remains smaller than the height of the <b>separator</b> (<b>channel</b> depths: 25 - 100 mu m), creaming is the main demulsification mechanism. Creaming refers to the migration of the dispersed phase of an emulsion, under the influence of buoyancy. The particles float upwards and rise to the top due to the difference in the densities of the particles and the medium. The separation efficiency depends mainly on the residence time of the liquid/liquid mixture in the device regardless of the <b>separator</b> dimensions and <b>channel</b> heights. The separation rate is limited by the removal of the cream layer, formed at the top of the upper plate, from the separator. When the size of the dispersed droplets is larger than the depth of the <b>separator</b> (<b>channel</b> height of 9 pm), the separation performance and mechanism become different. The coalescence of the dispersed droplets occurs by passing through the device. The comparison of the data corresponding to creaming and coalescence phenomena emphasizes that the coalescence greatly enhance and accelerate the separation action. The phase separation in the micro-coalescer takes place considerably faster than in the micro-separators...|$|R

40|$|Hydrodynamics of two {{external}} loop circulating bubble columns with open <b>channel</b> gas <b>separators</b> were investigated experimentally. The hydrodynamics were studied under {{the effects of}} three operating parameters and one design parameter. The operating parameters were superficial gas velocity in the riser, UGR, gas-liquid dispersion property, σ, and efficiency of gas separation, TVR. The design parameter was the scale-up factor of the riser to downcomer cross-sectional area AD/AR. The gas-liquid dispersion property was varied by using various concentrations of additives like antifoam, alcohol and wettable suspended solids. All experiments were conducted using compressed air and tap water from the university main supply system. Time-dependent hydrodynamics variation related to air-water quality was minimized by using consistent air-water samples {{in order to satisfy}} experimental reproducibility. The results show that for any gas-liquid-additive system, there is an optimum volume of the liquid in the gas separator, TVRO, that gives the minimum gas recirculation in the downcomer, εGD. At any AD/AR and TVR, the effects of antifoam and suspended solids were found to reduce the gas holdup, while the alcohols were found to increase gas holdup. At TVRO, the efficiency of the gas separator was improved significantly by increasing the scale-up factor, AD/AR. Liquid circulation was increased in the antifoam system, but reduced in the presence of wettable suspended solids. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the design and operating conditions were better at scale-up factor AD/AR= 0. 55 and volume ratio TVR> 20 %, than that at AD/AR= 0. 25 for all the additives investigated.

The highly stripped ion source {{has been designed to}} provide high current beams of multiply charged Phosphorous and Boron ions for high energy ion implantation. However, the total current transport efficiency was about 30 %. The modified computer code KOBRA has been used to simulate processes of ion extraction by dc-acceleration systems as well as beam transport and thus to determine main reasons for ion beam losses. The calculations indicated that the losses of extracted ion beam mainly occur in the transport <b>channel</b> and magnetic <b>separator.</b> The computer modeling allows find optimal geometry for ion-optical system.

40|$|Background. Microembolism during {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass {{has been}} suggested as being the predominant cause of neurocognitive disorders after cardiac surgery. Shed blood, normally retransfused into the patient during cardiopulmonary bypass, is {{a major source of}} lipid microemboli in the brain capillaries. A newly developed technique based on acoustic standing-wave separation of particles in fluid in microchannels, with the capacity to remove lipid particles in blood, is presented. Methods. A separator consisting of eight parallel, high-fidelity microfabricated channels was actuated with an ultrasound field to create a standing wave. Three different concentrations of lipid particles (diameter, 0. 3 mum) were added to blood samples with increasing hematocrits and introduced into the <b>separator</b> <b>channels</b> to separate lipid particles and erythrocytes. Results. The mean separation rates for lipid particles were 81. 9 % +/- 7. 6 % and for erythrocytes 79. 8 % +/- 9. 9 %, and both were related to the hematocrit level of the incoming blood sample. The procedure was atraumatic and did not cause hemolysis. Conclusions. Particle separation by means of an acoustic standing-wave technique can be used for atraumatic and effective removal of lipid particles from blood, with the possible clinical implication of reducing neurocognitive complications after cardiopulmonary bypass.

At the cathode-side, oxygen is transported as reactant gas from gas channel through GDL. When large quantity of moisture is generated during high power generation, moisture blocks transport of oxygen, and the cell voltage drops drastically. Narrow microgrooves with axes at tilt angle to the air flow were arranged inside channel walls. The water from GDL was discharged along microgrooves to facing top of GDL by forces of capillary and air flow shearing. Laser induced fluorescence method was used to measure water velocity in microgrooves. The effect of air velocity in the gas channel on water velocity in microgrooves was investigated. It was shown microgrooves manufactured inside gas channel worked properly. Water velocity in microgrooves increased with increasing air velocity, and moisture could be discharged from GDL by applying microgrooves. Furthermore, effective length of the microgrooves needed to remove water from the GDL surface increased with decreasing inclination angle of microgrooves in the range of 20 °? 45 °.

40|$|A {{radioactive}} {{ion beam}} (RIB) produced at a target bombarded with a primary beam has after a fragment separator {{a relatively large}} phase volume and small production rate. For instance, typical flux of 132 Sn isotope at the exit of fragment-separator is about 5 ⋅ 105 ions/s. Conventionally used scheme of the ion storage in a ring based on multitutrn injection and (or) RF stacking and stochastic cooling application can not provide a high storage rate at so pure intensity especially for short lived isotopes. In this report we discuss an alternative storage scheme which is oriented to the continuous ion beam from fragment separator at production rate of 104 ions/s or even less.
