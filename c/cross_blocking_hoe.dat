40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Studies were {{conducted}} to determine {{the effectiveness of a}} biological pollen barrier of rye, Secale cereale, in preventing out-crossing between Lolium multiflorum genotypes in each of the 300 <b>crossing</b> <b>blocks</b> established in this experiment. Fluorescent tests of seeds of open-pollinated and single-crossed progeny of four annual ryegrass sources were used to determine the effectiveness of the rye barrier in preventing <b>crossing</b> between <b>crossing</b> <b>blocks.</b> The average percentage of fluorescence of open-pollinated progeny in 30 <b>crossing</b> <b>blocks</b> containing supposedly only non-fluorescing plants was 16. 3 percent. The open-pollinated and single-crossed progeny in 46 other <b>crossing</b> <b>blocks</b> were highly correlated and did not differ significantly from each other in percent fluorescence. The percent fluorescence of each <b>crossing</b> <b>block</b> was mainly due to intra-crossing block pollen rather than inter-crossing block or foreign pollen. The results indicate that an eight foot barrier of rye is effective in preventing crossing between the annual ryegrass <b>crossing</b> <b>blocks.</b> Self-fertility of Lolium multiflorum was generally low, but self fertility estimates ranged from 0 to 87 percent. The results revealed that self-fertility data obtained by germination rather than seed count may give more accurate self-fertility estimates, especially when individual plants and their differences are being investigated. The average seed set under white parchment bags was not significantly lower than the average seed set obtained with bag-type dialysis tubing. The use of dialysis tubing as a substitute for white parchment bags in bagging plants would be of little, if any, benefit to improve seed set under bag in Lolium multiflorum...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} blocking effects, many deblocking filter algorithms {{have been proposed}} to provide nice solutions in still images [16 – 18]. The low-pass filter is also employed to eliminate blocking artifacts in video compression standards [19]. Tai et al. [20] proposed a deblocking algorithm based on five filtering modes by considering the activity across block boundaries. These five filtering modes include three frequency-related modes (the smooth mode, the intermediate mode, and the complex mode), one special mode, and a refined mode. Tai et al. [21] proposed a new method to remove blocking artifacts in the low bit-rate block-based video coding in H. 264 /AVC and MPEG- 4. However, {{it is necessary to}} modify the filtered block size in order to suit different codecs. Then, Chen and her coauthors [22] proposed a general method which is suitable for various video compression standards.

Despite the coast effect, this feature could be related to the deep upper mantle thermal anomaly leading to Cenozoic uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains rift flank. However, both the hypothetic event map polarized parallel to the coast and the induction arrows suggest that the area of enhanced conductivity may be confined to the Deep Freeze Range crustal block along the western flank of the Mesozoic Rennick Graben.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{structural}} complexities of a 28 -km long {{part of the}} Clark fault of the San Jacinto fault zone in southern California {{in order to better}} document its lateral extent and the style of deformation of its southeast end. Changes in structural style are observed as the Clark fault’s damage zone widens from ~ 1 - 2 km in crystalline rocks of the Peninsular Ranges southeastward to ~ 18 km in the sedimentary rocks of the San Felipe-Borrego subbasin of the Salton Trough. The Clark fault extends into the San Felipe-Borrego subbasin as the Arroyo Salada segment for ~ 11 - 12 km to a newly defined northeast-trending structural boundary. This structural boundary, referred to herein as the Pumpkin <b>Crossing</b> <b>block,</b> is a ~ 3 -km wide and ~ 8 -km long fault zone dominated by northeast-striking sinistral-normal strike-slip faults. Southeast of the Pumpkin <b>Crossing</b> <b>block</b> the newly defined San Felipe Hills segment extends the Clark fault another ~ 12 - 13 km southeast to its intersection with the Extra fault zone. The Clark fault may have nearly 14. 5 - 18 km of right separation represented in the surface deformation of the Arroyo Salada and San Felipe Hills segments, but the total amount of strain is masked by the wide diffuse fault zone with its complex deformation patterns and geometries. The lateral change observed in microseismicity patterns across the Arroyo Salada and San Felipe Hills segment boundary supports our structural interpretations about the existence, location, and structure of this boundary. Vertical patterns in the microseismicity suggest that the Clark fault zone narrows at depth, dips steeply northeast in the subsurface, and must interact with at least one weak decollement layer(s) beneath and/or with the sedimentary basin. Structural deformation within the late Miocene to Holocene silty- and clay-rich sedimentary basin of the Salton Trough includes features characteristic of strike-slip faults, such as stepovers, conjugate faults, folds, flower structures, and fault bends, as well as many unique structures that include pooch structures, ramp-flat geometries of strike-slip faults, complex en echelon fault zones with localized shear distributed across a high frequency network of faults, and heterogeneous kinematic indicators within individual fault zones...|$|R
