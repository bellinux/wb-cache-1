In the anime , Iori is seen searching for Ash to regain his powers. Iori appears in the spin-off manga story based on his adventure prior to The King of Fighters '96 entitled, The King of Fighters: Kyo. The character appears in the manhua adaptation of The King of Fighters: Zillion created by Andy Seto. The manhua retells Iori's story from his fight against Orochi until he attacks NESTS to destroy Kyo's clones. He also stars in further manhua for the games, starting with The King of Fighters 2001 through 2003 along with the Maximum Impact series.

5|$|Final Fantasy V was {{directed}} by Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi who, prior {{to the release of}} Final Fantasy IX, called it his favorite Final Fantasy game. The <b>character,</b> <b>image,</b> and title logo designs were created by series illustrator and image designer Yoshitaka Amano, while the actual character sprites were designed by Kazuko Shibuya. The monsters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura. Amano has stated that he counts his depictions of both Faris from Final Fantasy V and Terra from Final Fantasy VI among his favorite Final Fantasy designs. The writing of the scenario text was a collaborative effort between Sakaguchi and Yoshinori Kitase. Sakaguchi conceived the plot and was in charge of it, while Kitase tried to include more humor to lighten up the relatively serious story. The Job System was designed by Hiroyuki Ito, who worked on the game as a battle planner alongside Akihiko Matsui. Mode7 effects were used in the airship sequences, which moving in the airship would cause the planet to rotate on its axis. In total, Square employed a team of 45 people to create the game, and 16Mbits of space were used to accommodate for the sprites, animations, and detailed background. According to GamePro in a May1993 issue, the Japanese authorities had asked Square not to release the game during a school day because schoolchildren would skip class to wait in line for the game.|$|E

Most of the image-based techniques use probabilistic approaches to model a character from monocular sequences; on the other hand we use a determinist approach, recovering character's model and movement through a camera model. The recovered human models can be used for visualization purposes, to generate new virtual scenes of the analyzed sequence or for gait analysis...|$|R

25|$|A {{literary}} masterpiece {{from the}} 13th dynasty talking about Khufu {{is the famous}} Papyrus Westcar, where king Khufu witnesses a magical wonder and receives a prophecy from a magician named Dedi. Within the story, Khufu is characterised in a difficult-to-assess way. At one side he is depicted as ruthless when deciding to have a condemned prisoner decapitated to test the alleged magical powers of Dedi. At the other side Khufu is depicted as inquisitive, reasonable and generous: He accepts Dedi's outrage and his subsequent alternative offer for the prisoner, questions the circumstances and contents of Dedi's prophecy and rewards the magician generously after all. The contradictory depiction of Khufu {{is the object of}} great dispute between Egyptologists and historians to this day. Especially earlier Egyptologists and historians such as Adolf Erman, Kurt Heinrich Sethe and Wolfgang Helck evaluated Khufu's character as heartless and sacrilegious. They lean on the ancient Greek traditions of Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus, who described an exaggerated negative <b>character</b> <b>image</b> of Khufu, ignoring the paradoxical (because positive) traditions the Egyptians themselves had always taught.|$|E

40|$|Thinning of <b>character</b> <b>images</b> {{is a big}} challenge. Removal of strokes or {{deformities}} in thinning is {{a difficult}} problem. In this paper, we have proposed a medial axis based thinning strategy used for performing skeletonization of printed and handwritten <b>character</b> <b>images.</b> In this method, we have used shape characteristics of text to get skeleton of nearly same as the true character shape. This approach helps to preserve the local features and true shape of the <b>character</b> <b>images.</b> The proposed algorithm produces one pixel width thin skeleton. As a by-product of our thinning approach, the skeleton also gets segmented into strokes in vector form. Hence further stroke segmentation is not required. Experiment is done on printed English and Bengali characters and we obtain less spurious branches comparing with other thinning methods without any post processing. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|Many {{web pages}} in Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) are now posted in Asian web sites now. No browsers can view CJK {{characters}} without {{the installation of}} suitable fonts. However, font installation is quite complicated {{and a lot of}} space is required for storing fonts, making it infeasible in thin-client environments. This paper presents a server-based font display system called the Bitmap Font Gateway (BFG). BFG acts as a display server to process requests and responses between client machines and a web server. The system relies on character-to-image conversion on the server side to produce small CJK <b>character</b> <b>images</b> before they are sent to client browsers. There are two major subsystems in BFG: the Conversion Engine and the Input Method Engine. The Conversion Engine analyses the requested web page and produces a new web page with CJK characters being converted into embedded <b>character</b> <b>images.</b> The use of individual <b>character</b> <b>images</b> can reduce the web download time and also make character search possible. The Input Method Engine provides an interactive interface for users to input CJK characters in order to facilitate interactive form filling and searching without the need to install any third-party product on the client side. The proposed server-based solution is highly suitable for thinclient environments with limited hardware and software support...|$|R
