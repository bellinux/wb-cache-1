25|$|Amazon {{employs a}} {{multi-level}} e-commerce strategy. Amazon started {{by focusing on}} business-to-consumer relationships between itself and its customers and business-to-business relationships between itself and its suppliers and then moved to facilitate customer-to-customer with the Amazon marketplace which acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions. The company lets anyone sell nearly anything using its platform. In addition to an affiliate program that lets anyone post-Amazon links and earn a commission on <b>click-through</b> sales, {{there is now a}} program which lets those affiliates build entire websites based on Amazon's platform.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{keywords}} attribute, {{the description}} attribute {{is supported by}} most major search engines, like Yahoo! and Bing, while Google will fall back on this tag when information about the page itself is requested (e.g. using the related: query). The description attribute provides a concise explanation of a Web page's content. This allows the Web page authors to give a more meaningful description for listings than might be displayed if the search engine was unable to automatically create its own description based on the page content. The description is often, but not always, displayed on search engine results pages, so it can affect <b>click-through</b> rates. While clicks for a result can be a positive sign of effective title and description writing, Google does not recognize this meta element as a ranking factor, so using target keyword phrases in that element will not help a site rank better. W3C doesn't specify {{the size of this}} description meta tag, but almost all search engines recommend it to be shorter than 155 characters of plain text.|$|E

50|$|This factor favored PEI somewhat. A defendant's {{intent to}} confuse {{constitutes}} probative evidence of likely confusion: Courts normally {{assume that the}} defendant's intentions were carried out successfully. In this case, the evidence did not definitively establish defendants' intent. At a minimum, however, it did suggest that defendants did nothing to prevent <b>click-throughs</b> that resulted from the confusion. Moreover, Netscape profited from such <b>click-throughs.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Following initial {{informal}} discussions {{which resulted}} in a positive response, a formal consultation titled [...] "SOPA Initiative" [...] was opened by the community to consider specific proposals and preferred options. These included matters such as location (United States only or worldwide), and whether content should be disabled completely or still accessible after a <b>click-through</b> page. Eventually, the discussion led to a decision strongly in favor of a 24-hour global blackout of the site on January 18, disabling normal reading and editing functions, affirmed in a vote of approximately 1,800 editors. The blocking action was purposely not complete; users could access Wikipedia content from the mobile interface or mirror sites, or if they disabled JavaScript or other web browser functions. Within hours of the start of the blackout, many websites posted instructions for disabling the banner, by altering URLs, using browser add-ons such as Adblock Plus or Greasemonkey, or interrupting the page from loading completely.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Click-through</b> {{rates for}} ad campaigns vary tremendously. The very first online display ad shown for AT&T {{on the website}} HotWired in 1994, had a 44% <b>click-through</b> rate. [...] Over time the overall rate users click on webpage banner ads has decreased.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Click-through</b> {{rates for}} banner ads have {{decreased}} over time. When banner ads first started to appear, {{it was not}} uncommon to have rates above five percent. They have fallen since then, currently averaging closer to 0.2 or 0.3 percent. In most cases, a 2% <b>click-through</b> rate would be considered very successful, though the exact number is hotly debated and would vary depending on the situation. The average <b>click-through</b> rate of 3% in the 1990s declined to 2.4%-0.4% by 2002. [...] Since advertisers typically pay more for a high <b>click-through</b> rate, getting many click-throughs with few purchases is undesirable to advertisers. Similarly, by selecting an appropriate advertising site with high affinity (e.g., a movie magazine for a movie advertisement), the same banner can achieve a substantially higher CTR. Though personalized ads, unusual formats, and more obtrusive ads typically result in higher <b>click-through</b> rates than standard banner ads, overly intrusive ads are often avoided by viewers.|$|E

50|$|By contrast, {{payments}} to a website for a fixed number of impressions or <b>click-throughs,</b> in {{a contract that}} calls for specific financial compensation, would more likely be classified as fixed costs. On the other hand, payments for conversions (sales) would be classified as variable marketing costs.|$|R
50|$|An email <b>click-through</b> rate {{is defined}} as the number of {{recipients}} who click one or more links in an email and landed on the sender's website, blog, or other desired destination. More simply, email <b>click-through</b> rates represent the number of clicks that your email generated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{move to a}} session-based model {{might even}} give new life to beleaguered metrics such as the <b>click-through.</b> Many {{marketers}} equate a 1% <b>click-through</b> rate with only 1 in 100 visitors clicking on an advertisement. At best, this assumption is slightly imprecise... at worst, it is grossly inaccurate. For example, assume that a particularly [...] "sticky" [...] site averages 11 page views per visitor and a 3% <b>click-through</b> rate. This means that up to 33% of the audience could {{have responded to the}} advertisement, assuming no duplicate clicks.|$|E
50|$|Typically a {{large number}} of {{customers}} search for a product/service or register as page view on a referring page which is linked to the e-commerce site by a banner ad, ad network or conventional link. Only a small proportion of those seeing the advertisement or link actually click the link. The metric used to describe this ratio is the <b>click-through</b> rate (CTR) and represents the top level of the funnel. Typical banner and advertising <b>click-through</b> rates are 0.02% in late 2010 and have decreased over the past three years. <b>Click-through</b> rates are highly sensitive to small changes such as link text, link size, link position and many others and these effects interact cumulatively. The process of understanding which creative material brings the highest <b>click-through</b> rate is known as ad optimization.|$|E
30|$|Overall, 432, 632 {{advertising}} impressions on Facebook {{resulted in}} 4, 638 <b>click-throughs</b> {{to the survey}} over a 10 -day period; 1, 739 (38 % of <b>click-throughs)</b> consented and were asked questions used to determine eligibility. Of these, 15 identified their gender other than male, 37 were less than 18  years of age, 15 did not reside within the US, 335 did not self-report sex with {{a man in the}} past 6  months, and 86 did not respond to {{one or more of the}} eligibility questions, yielding a sample of 1, 285 (74 % of respondents to eligibility questions) who could potentially complete the survey. We restricted our analyses to 973 (81 % of 1, 204 HIV negative or unknown status participants) who answered at least one of the six acceptability questions. Compared to these participants, excluded men were more likely to be non-Hispanic black, but similar with respect to all other characteristics (data not shown in table).|$|R

5000|$|A {{significant}} portion of the budget (between £100,000 and £500,000) went into the creation of interactive content for Old Lions, allowing viewers to switch away from broadcasts of shorter versions to a dedicated advertising area where they could watch additional content, including the full three-minute commercial, a [...] "making-of" [...] documentary, outtakes, and additional scripted material. The service was available during commercial breaks until 26 June 2006, though the dedicated area remained open to <b>click-throughs</b> from 10-second cuts shown through the Sky Anytime service for some time.|$|R
50|$|Most email {{marketers}} {{use this}} metrics along with open rate, bounce rate and other metrics, {{to understand the}} effectiveness and success of their email campaign. In general there is no ideal <b>click-through</b> rate. This metric can vary based {{on the type of}} email sent, how frequently emails are sent, how the list of recipients is segmented, how relevant the content of the email is to the audience, and many other factors. Even time of day can affect <b>click-through</b> rate. Sunday appears to generate considerably higher <b>click-through</b> rates on average when compared {{to the rest of the}} week.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>click-through</b> rate of an {{advertisement}} {{is defined as}} the number of clicks on an ad divided by the number of times the ad is shown (impressions), expressed as a percentage. [...] For example, if a banner ad is delivered 100 times (100 impressions) and receives one click, then the <b>click-through</b> rate for the advertisement would be 1%.|$|E
5000|$|Frequency capping {{is often}} cited {{as a way to}} avoid banner burnout, the point where {{visitors}} are being overexposed and response drops. This may be true for direct-response campaigns whose effectiveness is measured in <b>click-throughs,</b> but it might run counter to campaigns whose goal is brand awareness, as measured by non-click activity.In social media, like YouTube video campaigns, failing to set up frequency capping may result in negative comments as the video ad becomes annoying, no matter how good it may be. Such comments may hurt the brand image, rather than boost its awareness.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the World Wide Web, mouse {{tracking}} was expanded to include click data. Researchers and developers would track and record each time a user used the mouse to click something on the website, as well as the location of the event. Web developers use these mouse clicks to assess what information users are interested in and how they interact with a page. Additionally, advertisers are interested in click data in terms of banner advertisements and where to place their ads on pages to get the most <b>click-throughs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{footprints}} {{left on the}} Internet help advertisers show consumers relevant Web ads, which {{increase awareness}} and <b>click-throughs.</b> This “proof of concept” experiment illustrates how Internet behavior can identify relevant television commercials that increase ad-effectiveness by raising attention and ad exposure. Product involvement and prior brand exposure, however, complicate effective Internet-targeting. Ad relevance matters more for low-involvement products, which have a short pre-purchase search process. For the same reason, using Web browsing behavior to make inferences about current ad relevance is more accurate for low-involvement products. Prior brand exposure reduces information-value, even for relevant commercials, and therefore dampens ad relevance's effect on attention and ad exposure...|$|R

The matching process is the first step of a framework to integrate data feeds from thirdparty data providers into a structured-search engine’s data warehouse. Our experiments show that traditional schemabased and instance-based schema matching methods fall short. We propose a new technique based on the search engine’s clicklogs. Two schema elements are matched if the distribution of keyword queries that cause <b>click-throughs</b> on their instances are similar. We present experiments on large commercial datasets that show the new technique has much better accuracy than traditional techniques. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Google {{search engine}} {{attracted}} a loyal following among {{the growing number}} of Internet users, who liked its simple design. In 2000, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords. The ads were text-based to maintain an uncluttered page design and to maximize page loading speed. Keywords were sold based on a combination of price bid and <b>click-throughs,</b> with bidding starting at $.05 per click. This model of selling keyword advertising was pioneered by Goto.com (later renamed Overture Services, before being acquired by Yahoo! and rebranded as Yahoo! Search Marketing). While many of its dot-com rivals failed in the new Internet marketplace, Google quietly rose in stature while generating revenue.|$|R

This paper re-examines {{the effectiveness of this}} approach when based on partial clicked data using the language modeling framework. We expand the original query by topical terms derived from clicked Web pages and enhance early precision via a more compact document representation. Since our URLs of Web pages are stripped, we first reconstruct them at different levels based on different collections. Our experimental results on the GOV 2 test collection and AOL query log show improvement by 31. 7 % and 28. 3 % significantly in statMAP for two sources of reconstruction and 153 ad-hoc queries. Our model also outperforms pseudo relevance feedback...|$|R
50|$|Modern online {{advertising}} has moved beyond just using banner ads. Popular search engines allow advertisers to display ads {{in with the}} search results triggered by a search user. These ads are usually in text format and may include additional links and information like phone numbers, addresses and specific product pages. This additional information {{moves away from the}} poor user experience that can be created from intrusive banner ads and provides useful information to the search user, resulting in higher <b>Click-through</b> rates for this format of Pay Per Click Advertising. Having high <b>click-through</b> rate isn't the only goal for an online advertiser who will occasionally develop campaigns to raise awareness and sacrifice <b>click-through</b> rate for the overall gain of valuable traffic.|$|E

50|$|Later in 1995, Network Solutions transferred, without permission, {{the domain}} to Stephen M. Cohen, {{who had been}} trying to gain control of the domain for some time by misrepresentation, using phone calls, e-mails and forged letters. He {{eventually}} persuaded an employee of Network Solutions to change the ownership details by submitting a fake fax. After gaining control of the domain, Cohen produced an advertising-heavy site that received up to 25 million hits a day. From payments for <b>click-throughs</b> and other advertising, Cohen was reportedly making $50,000 to $500,000 per month. Kremen undertook steps to recover the domain, while Cohen claimed he obtained the domain legally from Online Classifieds (OCI). A five-year legal battle ensued, led by cyberlawyer Charles Carreon.|$|R
