In the background on the left, a man is seen standing near a small <b>crank</b> and <b>pulley</b> system at the perimeter of a large waterways model. The <b>crank</b> and <b>pulleys</b> are attached to a long metallic crane arm that supports a large rectangular, wooden platform with rails at its end. The platform hangs high above the waterways system, and a man is seen standing atop the platform looking at the model below. Water is seen moving through various channels of the model against small cement ridges. Near the water channel on the right, another man stares at the flow of the water. Two small gates are also visible within this channel. To the right of the men, piles of wood and other materials lie in a large heap. In the background, a large building with numerous windows can be seen. In the small doorway of the building at center, a man can be seen looking {{in the direction of the}} model...|$|R

5000|$|Accessories — The {{crankshaft}} pulley diameter decreased by 14% (as {{compared to the}} GT) in order to under-drive the alternator, A/C, and smog pump, all to increase power. The water pump pulley also decreased in diameter by the same amount {{in order to preserve}} the ratio of pump speed, and thus coolant flow. These smaller accessory pulleys necessitated a shorter serpentine belt. Part Numbers: F3ZZ-6A312-A (<b>crank</b> <b>pulley),</b> F3ZZ-8509-A (water pump pulley), and F3ZZ-8620-A (belt).|$|E

Parts peculiar to this system include a toothed disc between the harmonic balancer and the <b>crank</b> <b>pulley,</b> the adjacent sensor (which predated the modern-day crankshaft position sensor, which Oldsmobile used with their Quad 4 in the late 1980s with a cast-in toothed section of the crankshaft), a special distributor, an engine temperature sensor, and a rudimentary computer mounted inside the car, under the dash. No other years or models were provided with this system.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, owners {{left with}} cars with seized engines {{that were going}} nowhere were {{provided}} with a solution by the Hurley Engineering Company. They supplied a torque converter adapter plate and other fittings so that a Ford Essex V4 engine could be fitted in the space left by a removed rotary engine. It was the only engine short enough to fit in the vacated space without modification to the body work. Depending on which Ford model it came from, the engine was available with front or rear sump wells, <b>crank</b> <b>pulley</b> or timing case mounted cooling fan, two capacities and a low compression version for using low grade fuel. In terms of smoothness and refinement, the V4 and the rotary were like chalk and cheese compared to the turbine quality of the rotary engine, but what the V4 did provide was dependability, an increase in torque and an improvement in fuel consumption. Later the Ford V6 was tried but needed body modifications, was thirsty and didn't quite have the right handling balance.|$|E

50|$|VX: Fitted {{with the}} same manual {{transmission}} as the USDM CX, the VX was identical to the base model CX except that it gained improved fuel efficiency through a 92 hp 1.5 L (D15Z1) VTEC-E engine yielding 48/55 mpg (city/hwy) revised to 2008 EPA rating: 39/49 mpg city/hwy or 44/51 mpg (city/hwy) revised to 2008 EPA rating: 36/46 mpg city/hwy. In Canada, it was rated by Transport Canada fuel consumption estimate: 4.7L/100 km city and 4.3L/100 km hwy. Other added features were an 8K tachometer with redline at 6K RPM, lightweight 13 in aluminum alloy wheels, as well as additional front & rear under-body trim additions to improve aerodynamic flow. The VX was also equipped with an aluminum alternator bracket, an aluminum front driver's side engine mount, and a lightweight <b>crank</b> <b>pulley.</b> In addition, the instrument cluster of the CX and VX featured a shift indicator light that would notify the driver when to shift upwards {{in order to achieve}} optimum mileage. To this day, the CX & VX models are lauded as one of the only gasoline-powered cars that rival the fuel economy of today's hybrids and diesels. In the March 2010 issue of Car & Driver for example, it mentions its long-term test car, a 2009 VW TDI Jetta with 6-speed dual-clutch auto transmission, got worse fuel mileage (38 mpg) than their 1992 Honda Civic VX test car (which got 41 mpg) and 2000 Honda Insight hybrid (48 mpg).|$|E
5000|$|In 1985 a revised, [...] "low friction" [...] {{design was}} introduced, dubbed the B200 and B230 (depending on displacement). Several {{components}} had design changes, longer rods (152 mm c-c, 7 mm longer), pistons {{with a lower}} compression height, lower friction bearings (smaller in size), a crankshaft with 8 counterweights (instead of 4 on the older Bxx engines) and a heavy harmonic balancer (aka damper) in the <b>crank</b> <b>pulley.</b> 1989 saw an upgrade to the crankshaft, with a relocated axial thrust bearing back to the number 5 journal, bigger main bearings, rods were enlarged to 13 mm from 9 mm in 1990. Also introduced in 1989 were 16 valve, twin-cam variants of the B200 and B230, dubbed the B204 and B234 respectively. The B204 was also available in turbo form in some markets (such as Italy) where large displacement motors were taxed heavily. It came in two versions: The B204GT turbo motor operates with a lead resistant lambda probe and generates approximately [...] The B204FT has a catalytic converter and generates [...] Both were the first redblocks standard equipped with oil squirters for piston cooling. Crankshaft, conrods and pistons all forged. Exhaust valves were sodium filled for cooler operation. It has smaller valves and stiffer valve springs than n/a 16V. Crank torque is 290 Nm at 2950 rpm for the GT, and 280 Nm for the FT. Other differences from the normal 16V redblock engine are that it uses a remote mounted oil filter (Away from block on exhaust side engine mount) and a windage tray.|$|E
5000|$|On May 18, Atlas 7D was {{prepared}} for a night launch of an RVX-2 reentry vehicle from LC-14, the second attempt to fly one after the launch of a C-series Atlas had miscarried two months earlier. The test was conducted with the Mercury astronauts in attendance in order to showcase the vehicle that would take them into orbit, but 64 seconds of flight ended in another explosion, prompting Gus Grissom to remark [...] "Are we really {{going to get on}} top of one of those things?". This failure was traced to improper separation of the right launcher hold-down pin, which damaged the B-2 nacelle structure and caused helium pressurization gas to escape during ascent. At 62 seconds into the launch, the pressure in the LOX tank exceeded the pressure in the RP-1 tank, which reversed the intermediate bulkhead. Two seconds later, the missile exploded. Film review confirmed that the hold-down pin on the right launcher arm failed to retract at liftoff and was jerked from the missile. The resultant force caused a four-inch gap in the B-2 nacelle structure which also damaged low pressure helium lines. The hold-down pin had not retracted due to a sheared retaining bolt in the bell <b>crank</b> <b>pulley</b> system in the right launcher arm. Once again, all other systems in the Atlas functioned well and there were no problems not directly attributable to the launcher malfunction. The flight of 7D resulted in improved maintenance procedures for the launcher equipment at CCAS and use of higher heat steel in the bell crank retaining bolts.|$|E
40|$|Design {{requirements}} for the cabin, cabin system, flight controls, engine installation, and wing-fuselage interface that provide adequate interior volume for occupant seating, cabin ingress and egress, and safety are presented. The fuselage structure must be sufficient to meet the loadings specified in the appropriate sections of Federal Aviation Regulation Part 23. The critical structure must provide a safe life of 10 (exp 6) load cycles and 10, 000 operational mission cycles. The cabin seating and controls must provide adjustment to account for various pilot physiques and to aid in maintenance and operation of the aircraft. Seats and doors shall not bind or lockup under normal operation. Cabin systems such as heating and ventilation, electrical, lighting, intercom, and avionics must {{be included in the}} design. The control system will consist of ailerons, elevator, and rudders. The system must provide required deflections with a combination of push rods, bell <b>cranks,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> and linkages. The system will be free from slack and provide smooth operation without binding. Environmental considerations include variations in temperature and atmospheric pressure, protection against sand, dust, rain, humidity, ice, snow, salt/fog atmosphere, wind and gusts, and shock and vibration. The following design goals were set to meet the requirements of the statement of work: safety, performance, manufacturing and cost. To prevent the engine from penetrating the passenger area {{in the event of a}} crash was the primary safety concern. Weight and the fuselage aerodynamics were the primary performance concerns. Commonality and ease of manufacturing were major considerations to reduce cost...|$|R
50|$|In a {{differential}} windlass, {{also called}} a Chinese windlass, {{there are two}} coaxial drums of different radii r and r′. The rope is wound onto one drum while it unwinds from the other, with a movable pulley hanging in the bight between the drums. Since each turn of the <b>crank</b> raises the <b>pulley</b> and attached weight by only (r − r′), very large mechanical advantages can be obtained.|$|R

He understood the principles governing momentum, centripetal force, friction and the aerofoil and applied these to his inventions. His scientific studies remained unpublished with, for example, his manuscripts describing the processes governing friction predating the introduction of Amontons' Laws of Friction by 150 years.|$|R
50|$|Over time engine {{development}} has continually advanced {{in almost all}} areas from material, operation and function. Many of the advances were led by the Japanese manufacturers as they have made quality and durability the cornerstone of their programs. The Japanese advanced the proliferation of forged crankshafts with rotating assemblies at 0 gram balance. Forged crankshafts are much stronger, significantly less apt to exhibit detrimental torsional crankshaft movement which also mitigates harmonic frequencies. This progression has also seen the addition of forged rods and pistons initially in forced induction engines and more recently in normally aspirated engines. Adding these additional forged components ramps the engines rigidity reducing concern about crankshaft damage even further. With the advent of computer aided design and finite element analysis manufacturers can now find and re-engineer weaker areas. Regardless {{of some of these}} improvements certain engines like the traditional V8 which has a firing order by nature prone to excessive harmonics necessitating the use of this device. The flat plane V8, traditionally used in more exotic engines, does not suffer from the excessive harmonics and therefore may use a solid undampened device. Modern (roughly 1988+) DOHC, SOHC Flat 4, I4, Flat 6, I6, V6, Flat 8, Flat Plane V8 have no need for this device. Over the years many of these engines use solid cast iron or aluminum <b>crank</b> <b>pulley</b> or audible NVH damper (reducing engine noise heard in the occupant compartment). Audible NVH has been the biggest factor in OE manufacturer decisions throughout the vehicle. In addition the pulleys on these engines are mounted loosely with a location fit negating any potential to act as an engine protective damper. Continental has recently provided detailed information on the maximum acceptable noise (NVH) that should be heard from under the hood from the engine in their Elite Belt program http://www.thequietbelt.com/#the-art-of-silence.|$|E

[...] The men whose duty it was were {{standing}} ready at the <b>cranks</b> and <b>pulleys,</b> their tools in hand, and instantly, groaning, the drawbridge flew up, casting into the water them that were flying across, down came the portcullis, and slew two men, while {{the gates of the}} inlet of the boulevard were swung to and barred, all, as it might he said, in the twinkling of an eye.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical and hydro-mechanical {{flight control}} systems are {{relatively}} heavy and require careful routing of flight control cables through the aircraft by systems of <b>pulleys,</b> <b>cranks,</b> tension cables and hydraulic pipes.

50|$|The {{earliest}} precursors {{to movies}} were magic lantern shows. Magic lanterns used a glass lens, a shutter {{and a powerful}} lamp to project images from glass slides onto a white wall or screen. These slides were originally hand-painted. The invention of the Argand lamp in the 1790s, limelight in the 1820s and the intensely bright electric arc lamp in the 1860s increased {{the brightness of the}} images. The magic lantern could project rudimentary moving images, which was achieved by the use of various types of mechanical slides. Typically, two glass slides, one with the stationary part of the picture and the other with the part that was to move, would be placed {{one on top of the}} other and projected together, then the moving slide would be hand-operated, either directly or by means of a lever or other mechanism. Chromotrope slides, which produced eye-dazzling displays of continuously cycling abstract geometrical patterns and colors, were operated by means of a small <b>crank</b> and <b>pulley</b> wheel that rotated a glass disc. Still photographs were used later on after the widespread availability of photography technologies after the mid-19th century. Magic lantern shows were often given at fairs or as part of magic shows. A magic lantern show at the 1851 World's Fair caused a sensation among the audience.|$|R
5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a <b>crank.</b> A large <b>pulley</b> {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|R
500|$|The steel sword was the {{greatest}} Spanish advantage in terms of weaponry. The conquistadors employed broadswords, rapiers, firearms (including the arquebus), crossbows and light artillery such as the falconet. An important Spanish advantage {{was the use of}} war horses; their deployment often terrified the native inhabitants of the Americas, who had never seen horses until European contact. As important as the physical advantage given to a mounted conquistador was the ability to rapidly move bodies of troops across a battlefield to outmaneuver their opponents, who were exclusively on foot. Repeated mounted charges could have a devastating impact on massed native infantry. The Spanish also employed fierce war dogs in battle. When laying siege to native fortresses, they would on occasion build wooden siege engines padded with cotton armour, which would act to shield attackers from enemy missiles, and allow them to climb over any fortifications. Mounted conquistadors were armed with a [...] lance, that also served as a pike for infantrymen. A variety of halberds and bills were also employed. As well as the one-handed broadsword, a [...] long two-handed version was also used.

50|$|One of Thomson's {{designs for}} the calculating part of a tide-predicting machine {{is shown in the}} figure (right), closely similar to the third machine of 1879-81. A long cord, with one end held fixed, passed {{vertically}} upwards and over a first upper pulley, then vertically downwards and under the next, and so on. These pulleys were all moved up and down by <b>cranks,</b> and each <b>pulley</b> took in or let out cord according to the direction in which it moved. These cranks were all moved by trains of wheels gearing into the wheels fixed on a drive shaft. The greatest number of teeth on any wheel was 802 engaging with another of 423. All the other wheels had comparatively small numbers of teeth. A flywheel of great inertia enabled the operator to turn the machine fast, without jerking the pulleys, and so to run off a year's curve in about twenty-five minutes. The machine shown in the figure was arranged for fifteen constituents in all.|$|R

There is a rush from every quarter of the shops, a cloud of flying natives, and a procession of more sedately pacing Englishmen, and in three short minutes you are left absolutely alone among arrested wheels and belts, <b>pulleys,</b> <b>cranks,</b> and cranes--in a silence only broken by the soft sigh of a far-away steam-valve or the cooing of pigeons. You are, by favour freely granted, at liberty to wander anywhere you please through the deserted works. Walk into a huge, brick-built, tin-roofed stable, capable of holding twenty-four locomotives under treatment, and see what must be done to the Iron Horse once in every three years if he is to do his work well. On reflection, Iron Horse is wrong. An engine is a she--as distinctly feminine as a ship or a mine. Here stands the Echo, her wheels off, resting on blocks, her underside machinery taken out, and her side scrawled with mysterious hieroglyphics in chalk. An enormous green-painted iron harness-rack bears her piston and eccentric rods, and a neatly painted board shows that such and such Englishmen are the fitter, assistant, and apprentice engaged in editing that Echo. An engine seen from the platform and an engine viewed from underneath are two very different things. The one is as unimpressive as a cart; the other as imposing as a man-of-war in the yard.|$|R
