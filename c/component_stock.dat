This paper seeks to determine at least a partial answer to this question for one particular financial innovation, the inverse ETF. We look at how the introduction of the first inverse ETF affects the market quality of the <b>component</b> <b>stocks.</b> We find that volatility and illiquidity of the <b>component</b> <b>stocks</b> decreases relative {{to the rest of the}} market, on average, after the introduction of the first inverse ETF. We also find that short selling increases in the <b>component</b> <b>stocks</b> relative to the rest of the market. We further our analysis and find that there is a positive relationship between the increased level of short selling and both volatility and liquidity. Therefore, we conclude that the improved market quality of the <b>component</b> <b>stocks</b> is attributable directly to the inverse ETF and not to the increased level of short selling...|$|R

5000|$|Cullinane's public {{offering}} was of note {{as it was}} the first successful offering of a pure software products company ever and the first software company Hambrecht & Quist ever took public. Cullinet was also the first software company to have a billion dollar valuation, and the first to do a Super Bowl ad. Specifically, Cullinane Database Systems, Inc., went public in 1978. On April 27, 1982 the company became the first computer software firm to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and later, the first to become a <b>component</b> <b>stock</b> of the S&P 500 Index. However, two quarters after the company went public IBM introduced its 4300 series. Its salesmen told all mutual clients that IDMS didn't run on the 4300 series and that all IBM software of the future would be built with IMS/DL1. This caused a major problem as every IDMS customer went ballistic and every prospect went on hold. The company only had three months to solve this marketing problem and technical problem, and remarkably, they did. Technically, it only required the modification of one instruction to get IDMS running on a 4300. The solution to the company's revenue problem turned out to be its new Integrated Data Dictionary. By moving very fast, the company used it to put IBM on the defensive and made its numbers, no small accomplishment. It then went from winning one out five competitions to winning four out five and this fueled its growth.|$|E
