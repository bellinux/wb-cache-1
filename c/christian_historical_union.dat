2500|$|Secularization, or {{the decline}} in religiosity, first became {{noticeable}} after 1960 in the Protestant rural areas of Friesland and Groningen. Then, it spread to Amsterdam, Rotterdam and the other large cities in the west. Finally the Catholic southern areas showed religious declines. As the social distance between the Calvinists and Catholics narrowed (and they began to intermarry), it became possible to merge their parties. The Anti Revolutionary Party [...] (ARP) in 1977 merged with the Catholic People's Party (KVP) and the Protestant <b>Christian</b> <b>Historical</b> <b>Union</b> (CHU) to form the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). However, a countervailing trend later appeared {{as the result of}} a religious revival in the Protestant Bible Belt, and the growth of the Muslim and Hindu communities as a result of immigration and high fertility levels.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1922 {{election}} {{the party}} entered Parliament when Kersten won {{a seat in}} the House of Representatives. In this period the SGP became most noted for proposing, during the annual parliamentary debate on the budget of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, to abolish Dutch representation to the Holy See. Each year the Protestant <b>Christian</b> <b>Historical</b> <b>Union</b> (CHU) also voted in favor of this motion. [...] The CHU was in cabinet with the Catholic General League, but many of its members and supporters still had strong feelings against the Catholic Church. [...] In 1925 the left-wing opposition (the Free-thinking Democratic League and Social Democratic Workers' Party) also voted in favor of the motion. They were indifferent to the representation at the Holy See, but saw this as a possibility to divide the confessional cabinet. And indeed the cabinet fell over this issue, in {{what is known as the}} Nacht van Kersten ("Night of Kersten").|$|E

2500|$|Until 1963, the SGP was {{relatively}} isolated in parliament. The strongly antipapal SGP {{refused to cooperate}} with either the Catholic People's Party or the secularist People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and Labour Party (PvdA). The larger Protestant Anti Revolutionary Party (ARP) had some sympathy for the party, but cooperated tightly with the KVP and the Protestant <b>Christian</b> <b>Historical</b> <b>Union</b> (CHU). In 1963 another orthodox Protestant party, the Reformed Political League (GPV) entered parliament, in 1981 {{they were joined by}} the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF). Together these three parties formed the [...] "Small Christian parties". [...] They shared the same orthodox Protestant political ideals and had the same political strategy, as testimonial parties. They cooperated in municipalities, both in municipal executives, where the parties were strong, as well as in common municipal parties, where the parties were weak. In the 1984 European Parliamentary election the parties presented a common list and they won one seat in parliament. [...] After 1993 the cooperation between the GPV and the RPF intensified, but the SGP's position at the time on female suffrage prevented the SGP joining this closer cooperation. However, in 2000 the GPV and RPF merged to form the ChristianUnion (CU). Traditionally the SGP and the CU worked together closely as they were both based on Protestant Christian politics. Recently however, as the CU has moved more towards the centre-left, discernible differences of philosophy between the SGP and CU have caused the parties to not join together in elections. The most notable example was the 2011 senate election where the SGP and CU did not combine their votes.|$|E

50|$|The rather {{complicated}} name of {{the party}} League of caucuses on <b>Christian</b> <b>Historical</b> foundation {{in the province of}} Friesland was chosen to convey several things: the party was not a centralized party with party discipline, instead it was a league of local caucuses; the term <b>Christian</b> <b>Historical</b> was used before 1898 to denote supporters of the main Protestant party, the Anti Revolutionary Party, emphasizing the Protestant nature {{of the history of the}} Netherlands; and finally the only representatives of the party came from Friesland, although it also had branches in South Holland.|$|R
