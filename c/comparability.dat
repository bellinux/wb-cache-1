5|$|Evolving {{even further}} from metalcore comes mathcore, a more rhythmically {{complicated}} and progressive style {{brought to light}} by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Protest the Hero. Mathcore's main defining quality {{is the use of}} odd time signatures, and has been described to possess rhythmic <b>comparability</b> to free jazz.|$|E
5|$|Berry {{served in}} {{management}} for the Montgomery County government from 1982 to 1984 and as staff {{director of the}} Maryland Senate Finance Committee from 1984 to 1985. From 1985 to 1994, he was legislative director for U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer, and associate staffer on the House Appropriations Committee. Berry assisted Hoyer on employment issues of the federal government, and {{played a leading role}} in negotiations that led to the Federal Employees Pay <b>Comparability</b> Act of 1990, which established the locality pay system. From 1994 to 1995, Berry served as Deputy Assistant Secretary and acting Assistant Secretary for Law Enforcement in the U.S. Treasury Department. From 1995 to 1997, Berry worked as director of government relations and as senior policy advisor at the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Key {{elements}} in the game are negotiation with and the fusion and creation of demons. Encountered in battle, demons can be talked with and negotiated into running from the battle, giving money or items, or joining the player's party. If the negotiation fails, the demon will attack. Once a demon is won over, they are given a loyalty meter which {{is influenced by the}} player's actions. If the demon is treated well and performs actions in battle it approves of, its loyalty will increase. If the opposite occurs, the demon will begin to disobey the protagonist, then leave. Demons can be fused together at a special location in the game called the Hotel Goumaden, where fusions are supervised by the NPC Dr. Victor. Demon fusion is governed by a <b>comparability</b> system, with more favorable fusions emerging from better demon compatibility. Demons can also be fused with weapons to grant stat boosts, and after a certain point in the game artificial demons called Zomas can be used and strengthened through repeated fusions.|$|E
25|$|The {{complement}} of any interval graph is a <b>comparability</b> graph. The <b>comparability</b> relation is called an interval order. Interval graphs {{are exactly the}} graphs that are chordal and that have <b>comparability</b> graph complements.|$|E
25|$|A <b>comparability</b> graph is an {{undirected graph}} formed from a partial order by {{creating}} a vertex per element of the order, and an edge connecting any two comparable elements. Thus, a clique in a <b>comparability</b> graph corresponds to a chain, and an independent set in a <b>comparability</b> graph corresponds to an antichain. Any induced subgraph of a <b>comparability</b> graph is itself a <b>comparability</b> graph, formed from the restriction of the partial order to a subset of its elements.|$|E
25|$|Cographs can be {{characterized}} as the <b>comparability</b> graphs of series-parallel partial orders; thus, cographs are also <b>comparability</b> graphs.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>comparability</b> graphs are perfect, many {{problems}} that are hard on more general classes of graphs, including graph coloring and the independent set problem, can be computed in polynomial time for <b>comparability</b> graphs.|$|E
25|$|In some {{classes of}} graphs, {{it has been}} proven that the pathwidth and treewidth are always equal to each other: {{this is true for}} cographs, {{permutation}} graphs, the complements of <b>comparability</b> graphs, and the <b>comparability</b> graphs of interval orders.|$|E
25|$|Every <b>comparability</b> graph is perfect. The {{perfection}} of <b>comparability</b> graphs is Mirsky's theorem, and the {{perfection of}} their complements is Dilworth's theorem; these facts, together with the perfect graph theorem {{can be used to}} prove Dilworth's theorem from Mirsky's theorem or vice versa. More specifically, <b>comparability</b> graphs are perfectly orderable graphs, a subclass of perfect graphs: a greedy coloring algorithm for a topological ordering of a transitive orientation of the graph will optimally color them.|$|E
25|$|In graph theory, a <b>comparability</b> graph is an {{undirected graph}} that connects pairs of {{elements}} that are comparable {{to each other in}} a partial order. <b>Comparability</b> graphs have also been called transitively orientable graphs, partially orderable graphs, and containment graphs.|$|E
25|$|Threshold graphs {{are another}} {{special kind of}} <b>comparability</b> graph.|$|E
25|$|The {{complement}} of every <b>comparability</b> graph is a string graph.|$|E
25|$|A cograph is a <b>comparability</b> graph of a series-parallel partial order.|$|E
25|$|The trivially perfect graphs are the <b>comparability</b> graphs of rooted trees.|$|E
25|$|Low-dimensional <b>comparability</b> graphs: The <b>comparability</b> graph for a {{partially}} ordered set has a vertex for each set element and an edge between two set elements that are related by the partial order. The order dimension of a partial order is the minimum number of linear orders whose intersection is the given partial order. If a partial order has bounded order dimension, then an adjacency labeling scheme for the vertices in its <b>comparability</b> graph may be defined by labeling each vertex with its position {{in each of the}} defining linear orders, and determining that two vertices are adjacent if each corresponding pair of numbers in their labels has the same order relation as each other pair. In particular, this allows for an adjacency labeling scheme for the chordal <b>comparability</b> graphs, which come from partial orders of dimension at most four.|$|E
25|$|<b>Comparability</b> graphs {{can also}} be {{characterized}} by a list of forbidden induced subgraphs.|$|E
25|$|Convergence {{is driven}} by several factors, {{including}} the belief that having a single set of accounting requirements would increase the <b>comparability</b> of different entities' accounting numbers, which {{will contribute to the}} flow of international investment and benefit a variety of stakeholders. Criticisms of convergence include its cost and pace, and the idea that the link between convergence and <b>comparability</b> may not be strong.|$|E
25|$|A poset is graded if {{and only}} if every {{connected}} component of its <b>comparability</b> graph is graded, so further characterizations will suppose this <b>comparability</b> graph to be connected. On each connected component the rank function is only unique up to a uniform shift (so the rank function can always be chosen so that the elements of minimal rank in their connected component have rank 0).|$|E
25|$|A {{permutation}} graph is a containment graph {{on a set}} of intervals. Therefore, permutation graphs {{are another}} subclass of <b>comparability</b> graphs.|$|E
25|$|Because {{strongly}} perfect graphs, perfectly orderable graphs, distance-hereditary graphs, and <b>comparability</b> graphs are all perfect graphs, cographs {{are also}} perfect.|$|E
25|$|If a graph {{is both a}} split graph and an {{interval}} graph, then its complement is both a split graph and a <b>comparability</b> graph, and vice versa. The split <b>comparability</b> graphs, and therefore also the split interval graphs, can be characterized {{in terms of a}} set of three forbidden induced subgraphs. The split cographs are exactly the threshold graphs, and the split permutation graphs are exactly the interval graphs that have interval graph complements. Split graphs have cochromatic number 2.|$|E
25|$|Before {{considering}} {{the factors that}} motivate the performance paradox, {{it is important to}} point out that characteristics known as <b>comparability</b> and variability differentiate good performance measures from bad ones. <b>Comparability</b> is defined as the potential to utilize a performance measure across different settings to horizontally compare performance. Variability is essential because it ensures that evaluations can be recorded on an outcome scale that is extended enough to vertically compare different levels of performance. Within organizations, these two properties are impacted by the use of several weakly correlated performance measures through a mechanism termed the running down process.|$|E
25|$|Special {{cases of}} the cographs include the {{complete}} graphs, complete bipartite graphs, cluster graphs, and threshold graphs. The cographs are, in turn, special {{cases of the}} distance-hereditary graphs, <b>comparability</b> graphs, and perfect graphs.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} {{failed in}} its objectives, only {{resulting in the}} capture of one thousand prisoners. Casualties for the two mounted divisions were <b>comparability</b> light at fifty dead and 310 wounded, while the 60th Division suffered 1,116 casualties.|$|E
25|$|Every cograph {{is also a}} <b>comparability</b> graph of a series-parallel partial order, {{obtained}} by replacing the disjoint union and join operations by which the cograph was constructed by disjoint union and ordinal sum operations on partial orders.|$|E
25|$|This use of {{different}} measures {{leads to a}} lack of <b>comparability,</b> which is problematic when monitoring progress towards targets. There are arguments for the adoption of a common measurement tool, or at least the development of communication between different tools.|$|E
25|$|If a graph family F {{is closed}} under the {{operation}} of taking induced subgraphs, then every graph in F is also locally F. For instance, every chordal graph is locally chordal; every perfect graph is locally perfect; every <b>comparability</b> graph is locally comparable.|$|E
25|$|Water {{pollution}} may {{be analyzed}} through several broad categories of methods: physical, chemical and biological. Most involve collection of samples, followed by specialized analytical tests. Some methods may {{be conducted in}} situ, without sampling, such as temperature. Government agencies and research organizations have published standardized, validated analytical test methods to facilitate the <b>comparability</b> of results from disparate testing events.|$|E
25|$|<b>Comparability</b> Adjustments. The valuer may {{adjust the}} subject company's {{financial}} statements {{to facilitate a}} comparison between the subject company and other businesses in the same industry or geographic location. These adjustments are intended to eliminate differences between the way that published industry data is presented {{and the way that}} the subject company's data is presented in its financial statements.|$|E
25|$|The order {{complex of}} a {{partially}} ordered set consists of the chains (totally ordered subsets) of the partial order. If every pair of some subset is itself ordered, then the whole subset is a chain, so the order complex satisfies the no-Δ condition. It may be interpreted as the clique complex of the <b>comparability</b> graph of the partial order.|$|E
25|$|Equivalently, a <b>comparability</b> graph is a graph {{that has}} a {{transitive}} orientation, an assignment of directions {{to the edges of}} the graph (i.e. an orientation of the graph) such that the adjacency relation of the resulting directed graph is transitive: whenever there exist directed edges (x,y) and (y,z), there must exist an edge (x,z).|$|E
25|$|A {{transitive}} {{orientation of}} a graph, if it exists, {{can be found}} in linear time. However, the algorithm for doing so will assign orientations to the edges of any graph, so to complete the task of testing whether a graph is a <b>comparability</b> graph, one must test whether the resulting orientation is transitive, a problem provably equivalent in complexity to matrix multiplication.|$|E
25|$|A set A of {{vertices}} in a graph {{is said to}} be {{a module}} if every vertex in A has the same set of neighbours outside of A. Any graph has a uniquely recursive decomposition into modules, its modular decomposition, which can be constructed from the graph in linear time; modular decomposition algorithms have applications in other graph algorithms including the recognition of <b>comparability</b> graphs.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, a <b>comparability</b> graph is a graph such that, {{for every}} {{generalized}} cycle of odd length, {{one can find}} an edge (x,y) connecting two vertices that are at distance two in the cycle. Such an edge is called a triangular chord. In this context, a generalized cycle is defined to be a closed walk that uses each edge of the graph at most once in each direction.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} change after 2000 was the {{increasing use of}} empirical studies in order to evaluate algorithms. This development took place due to the emergence of transparent corpora. Although there are still discussions about what the best evaluation metrics are, the use of experimental evaluation has already led to a better <b>comparability</b> of algorithms, a discussion about the goals of REG and more task-oriented research.|$|E
25|$|The Hong Kong Diploma for Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) will be {{conducted}} {{for the first time}} in 2012. To secure appropriate recognition of HKDSE qualifications, the HKEAA has been holding discussions with international agencies including University of Cambridge International Examinations (CIE), National Academic Recognition Information Centre (NARIC), Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) in the UK and the Australian Education International (AEI) in Australia to conduct benchmarking and <b>comparability</b> research on HKDSE.|$|E
