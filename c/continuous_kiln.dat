5000|$|A <b>continuous</b> <b>kiln,</b> {{sometimes}} called a tunnel kiln, {{is a long}} structure in which only the central portion is directly heated. From the cool entrance, ware is slowly transported through the kiln, and its temperature is increased steadily as it approaches the central, hottest part of the kiln. From there, it continues through the kiln, and the surrounding temperature is reduced until it exits the kiln nearly at room temperature. A <b>continuous</b> <b>kiln</b> is energy-efficient, because heat given off during cooling is recycled to pre-heat the incoming ware. In some designs, the ware is left in one place, while the heating zone moves across it. Kilns in this type include: ...|$|E
5000|$|The Hoffmann kiln is {{a series}} of batch process kilns. Hoffmann kilns are the most common kiln used in {{production}} of bricks and some other ceramic products. Patented by German Friedrich Hoffmann for brickmaking in 1858, it was later used for lime-burning, and was known as the Hoffmann <b>continuous</b> <b>kiln.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{theoretical}} heat (the standard enthalpy) {{of reaction}} {{required to make}} high-calcium lime is around 3.15 MJ per kg of lime, so the batch kilns were only around 20% efficient. The key to development in efficiency was the invention of <b>continuous</b> <b>kilns,</b> avoiding the wasteful heat-up and cool-down cycles of the batch kilns. The first were simple shaft kilns, similar in construction to blast furnaces. These are counter-current shaft kilns. Modern variants include regenerative and annular kilns. Output is usually in the range 100-500 tonnes per day.|$|R
50|$|Around 1885, {{experiments}} {{began on}} design of <b>continuous</b> <b>kilns.</b> One design was the shaft kiln, similar in design to a blast furnace. Rawmix {{in the form}} of lumps and fuel were continuously added at the top, and clinker was continually withdrawn at the bottom. Air was blown through under pressure from the base to combust the fuel. The shaft kiln had a brief period of use before it was eclipsed by the rotary kiln, but it had a limited renaissance from 1970 onward in China and elsewhere, when it was used for small-scale, low-tech plants in rural areas away from transport routes. Several thousand such kilns were constructed in China. A typical shaft kiln produces 100-200 tonnes per day.|$|R
50|$|In 1893, {{the company}} added a <b>continuous</b> down-draft <b>kiln</b> which {{increased}} {{the quality and}} amount of bricks produced. By 1907 the company had two of these kilns in operation and was producing between 85,000 and 100,000 bricks per day. After a 1904 major fire destroyed much of downtown Toronto, the Brick Works supplied the brick {{for much of the}} ensuing construction.|$|R
50|$|Samuel Augustus Weller died on October 4, 1925. His nephew Harry Weller became {{president}} from 1925−1932, introducing <b>continuous</b> <b>kiln</b> operation. He consolidated the Weller plants in 1931 due to depression era economics, {{and died in}} auto crash in 1932. From 1930−1932, the last freehand decorated lines introduced at Weller were Stellar, Geode, Cretone, Raceme, and Bonito.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} of the Settle-Carlisle Railway made heavy industry possible in Langcliffe and a Hoffman <b>Continuous</b> <b>Kiln</b> was built in 1873 for the Craven Lime Company. Lime burning became a key local industry but {{is now part of}} Craven’s industrial past. The kiln was patented by German inventor Friedrich Hoffman in 1858. The kiln at Langcliffe had 22 chambers where limestone was continuously burned in a circuit that took around six weeks to complete. The operation was very labour-intensive and provided employment for local residents but the working conditions were unhealthy and dangerous.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1843 by two young engineers, William Craven and Richard Bradley to {{manufacture}} what was then revolutionary machinery for automating clay brick production. Their 1853 patented ‘Stiff-Plastic Brickmaking Machine’, {{in combination with the}} Hoffman <b>continuous</b> <b>kiln</b> was responsible for changes in the industry which eventually saw it shift from a hand craft to a mechanized production line. Their machines were manufactured at the Westgate Common Foundry in Wakefield and were sold throughout the United Kingdom as well as many oversees markets such as Australia, South Africa and Germany.|$|E
50|$|In 1936, Brayton {{married his}} second wife, Ellen Webster Grieve (known as “Webb”), {{and they began}} to {{transform}} the small workshop into a larger commercial enterprise. They constructed a new manufacturing facility on a five-acre plot of land in 1938, between the Pacific Coast Highway and Glenneyre Street. The completely modern new location featured two <b>continuous</b> tunnel <b>kilns,</b> essential for large-scale production, as well as design facilities and a showroom.|$|R
50|$|The Hoffman brickworks {{was founded}} by Jenkin Collier and James McKenzie with Messrs Barry Owen and Rourke. Initially it {{employed}} Pratt brick presses, and constructed Hoffman patent <b>continuous</b> firing <b>kilns,</b> developed by Friedreich Hoffman in Stettin, Prussia in 1859. In 1887 the company had ordered Bradley & Craven Ltd automatic brick presses, which were fabricated by Langlands foundry {{and a year later}} purchased another at the centennial exhibition. The first kiln was circular, but the company rapidly expanded and added at least five oblong Hoffman Kilns between 1880 and about 1914.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{possible}} energy savings were investigated by introducing a new layout of a 2 -zone progressive kiln. The layout consisted of installing a door {{between the first}} and second zone, thereby allowing the two zones to be run at different temperature levels -making internal heat recovery possible. An Optimized Two Stage <b>continuous</b> <b>kiln</b> is dimensioned for drying sideboard of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) with the aid of a commercial simulation program. Temperature levels of 75 / 55 °C (dry bulb/wet bulb) were chosen at the pressure side of zone 1 and 45 / 25 °C (dry bulb/wet bulb) at the pressure side of zone 2. The capacity of the heat exchanger was assumed to be sufficient to make the suggested design functional and no consideration was given to the increased air flow resistance the introduction of the heat exchanger would cause. The results indicated that roughly 30 % of the heat is possible to recover in comparison to a traditional kiln. It was finally concluded that the influence of ingoing process parameters needs to be implemented in the kiln control system to fully utilize the kilns potential.

50|$|Tom Clark, one of Rice Owen Clark's great-grandsons, {{began working}} in the firm during the depression. He was {{responsible}} for the plant expanding in 1937 to produce items unrelated to the building trade such as electrical insulation equipment and moulds for rubber products such as gloves, baby bottle teats and condoms. Clark was an employer who always encouraged his staff to experiment with new products. As a result, an oil-fired <b>continuous</b> tunnel <b>kiln</b> was built in 1941, and tableware manufacture began the following year. The company had established a research department in 1938 to investigate the viability of producing tableware from New Zealand clays.|$|R
40|$|HF (hydrogen fluoride) {{emission}} control {{is one of}} the critical environmental parameters in the firing of ceramic materials at peak temperatures higher than 1000 °C. In this study, in-stack concentrations of HF were monitored on-line with laser-based equipment during the fast firing of ceramic tiles in continuous industrial roller hearth kilns under standard kiln operating conditions. Three different ceramic tile compositions: porous red-body wall tiles, red-body stoneware tiles, and porcelain tiles were fired in industrial kilns customarily used to manufacture these types of tiles, modifying the heating rate and tile dry bulk density. The in-stack concentrations of HF can be explained on the basis of tile HF adsorption and emission processes in the kiln preheating and firing zones, analysed in previous studies. The methodology used in this study has significant advantages for industrial studies compared with previous methodologies based primarily on laboratory-scale studies and analysis of solid material. The main advantages are: (a) rapid response, allowing abrupt changes in the HF emission to be studied; and (b) direct measurement of the in-stack concentration of HF, which is the most common parameter used as a legal limit for industrial {{emission control}}. The study shows that tile HF adsorption in the preheating zone is very important. It also shows that HF stack emissions can vary significantly in <b>continuous</b> <b>kilns</b> depending on whether glazed or unglazed tiles are produced, or important changes occur in production (such as gaps in the kiln feed). The results indicate, furthermore, that HF stack emissions do not decrease significantly when realistic changes are made in industrial operating conditions if these industrial kilns are run at peak temperatures above 1100 °C. The most important reduction in in-stack concentrations of HF is observed when glazed ceramic tiles are fired, so further research in this field can be made in order to reduce HF emissions. © 2009 Elsevier B.

Moreover, with the judicious use of storage and air renewal, drying schedules could be produced for a better quality of dried wood...|$|R
50|$|The first Rumford kiln was {{constructed}} in 1802 in Rüdersdorf near Berlin, {{and one of them}} can still be explored at the Museumspark Rüdersdorf. The innovation rapidly spread throughout Europe because it made it possible to produce quicklime far more efficiently than predecessor technologies. These required either batch production, waiting for each load to be assembled, burn and cool before removal, or carefully mixing the fuel and limestone in the appropriate proportions, burning them together, and then cleaning the contaminated limestone afterward.In a Rumford <b>kiln</b> <b>continuous</b> operation was possible for the first time, since the addition of fuel and limestone as well as the removal of ash and quicklime could be separately optimized according to need, and all these operations could take place simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nowadays alumina ceramic {{substrates}} {{are widely}} used for high precision applications in electronic devices, such as hybrid integrated circuits (HIC). Usually, the alumina ceramic substrates are shaped through tape casting method and sintered in <b>continuous</b> slab <b>kilns.</b> The sintering aids used to enhance densification during sintering give rise {{to the formation of}} an alumino-silicate liquid phase, which is of crucial importance in pressureless and low-temperature sintering (< 1600 °C) of alumina ceramics. The preferential migration of liquid phase to the surface of alumina substrates under the capillary action and its transformation into glassy phase during cooling affects the subsequent processing steps of HIC. A smoothening effect on surface with its enrichment in glassy phase is accompanied by a decrease of the surface toughness. On the other hand, the accumulated glassy phase onto the surface has a great effect on laser cutting. The high temperatures developed during laser cutting turn the superficial glassy phase into liquid again, while rapid solidification will occur after removing laser beam. The fast cooling of the liquid phase causes formation of extensive network of cracks on the surface of alumina substrate. Apparently, the presence of such faults degrades mechanical strength and thermal shock resistance of alumina substrates. Meanwhile, the recast layers and spatter deposits at the periphery of the hole has been observed...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 1. 5 billion tyres are {{produced}} each year which will eventually enter {{the waste stream}} representing a major potential waste and environmental problem. However, there is growing interest in pyrolysis as a technology to treat tyres to produce valuable oil, char and gas products. The most common reactors used are fixed-bed (batch), screw kiln, rotary kiln, vacuum and fluidised-bed. The key influence on the product yield, and gas and oil composition, {{is the type of}} reactor used which in turn determines the temperature and heating rate. Tyre pyrolysis oil is chemically very complex containing aliphatic, aromatic, hetero-atom and polar fractions. The fuel characteristics of the tyre oil shows that it is similar to a gas oil or light fuel oil and has been successfully combusted in test furnaces and engines. The main gases produced from the pyrolysis of waste tyres are H, C-C hydrocarbons, CO, CO and HS. Upgrading tyre pyrolysis products to high value products has concentrated on char upgrading to higher quality carbon black and to activated carbon. The use of catalysts to upgrade the oil to a aromatic-rich chemical feedstock or the production of hydrogen from waste tyres has also been reported. Examples of commercial and semi-commercial scale tyre pyrolysis systems show that small scale batch reactors and <b>continuous</b> rotary <b>kiln</b> reactors have been developed to commercial scale...|$|R

It has been verified that an increase of the temperature level or residence time leads to a decrease of the process mass yield. Furthermore, it has been evidenced that an increase of the solid hold-up tends to decrease the mass yield too. Studying the temperature profile along the kiln has enabled to locate the drying and torrefaction zones. Torrefaction only begins in {{the last third of}} the heating zone.

40|$|Biomass and wastes are {{potential}} {{resources for the}} production of renewable hydrogen, synthetic fuels, chemicals and energy via pyrolysis and gasification. Waste biomass and refuse derived fuel (RDF), and their single components were investigated for pyrolysis to produce a hydrogen rich syngas with a bench scale fixed bed reactor. The samples were pyrolysed at different temperatures, heating rates and particle sizes to recover syngas, oil and char products. The waste biomass was investigated for steam pyrolysisgasification in a <b>continuous</b> screw <b>kiln</b> reactor to produce hydrogen. The samples were gasified at different temperatures, steam/biomass ratios, and in the presence of nickel catalysts. The effects of nickel loading on the catalyst, the catalyst/waste biomass ratio, the effects of different metal additives and the effect of in-situ CO 2 capture were also investigated for hydrogen production and resistance to catalyst deactivation by coking. A commercial scale pyrolysis reactor was studied for the pyrolysis of real world wastes. FTIR and GC/MS analysis of the oils from the pyrolysis of waste biomass, RDF and their single components indicated that the oil product from high heating rate pyrolysis contained mostly aromatics and alkenes, while that from slow heating rate contained mostly oxygenates, alkanes and alkenes. Gaseous products from the waste biomass, RDF and their single components contained mostly CO, CO 2, H 2, CH 4 and C 2 – C 4 gases. Increasing the pyrolysis temperature and heating rate both resulted in an increase in gas and hydrogen production while reducing the oil and solid char yields. The gas yield and hydrogen yield were increased with increasing nickel loading and catalyst to waste biomass ratio during steam pyrolysisgasification.

The rate of water injection was also shown to be critical for hydrogen production. The maximum hydrogen produced was 52 % of the maximum theoretical hydrogen available in the polypropylene, representing 22 ̇ 38 g of hydrogen per 100 g polypropylene, obtained with the Ni-Mg- Al catalyst, at 800 °C gasification temperature and with 28 ̇ 46 g/h water injection rate...|$|R
40|$|Colombia is a remarkablecoal {{producer}} and exporter worldwide; several sectors use this resource for electricity and thermal energy production. Among them, the ceramic industry consumed 118, 590 tons in 2011.

The overall objective of this project is to determine whether Illinois Basin coal is a suitable feedstock {{for the production of}} CMS and to evaluate the potential application of these products in commercial gas separation processes. In Phase I of this project, gram quantities of char were produced from IBC- 102 coal in a fixed-bed reactor under a wide range of pyrolysis and activation conditions. Chars having surface areas. of 1500 [...] 2100 m{sup 2 }/g were produced by chemical activation using potassium hydroxide as the activant. These high surface area chars had more than twice the adsorption capacity of commercial {{molecular sieves}}. The kinetics of adsorption of various gases, i. e., O{sub 2 }, N{sub 2 }, CO{sub 2 }, CH{sub 4 } and H{sub 2 } on these chars at 25 {degree}C was studied. Several chars showed good potential for efficient O{sub 2 }/N{sub 2 }, CO{sub 2 }/CH{sub 4 }, CO{sub 2 }/H{sub 2 } and CH{sub 4 }/H{sub 2 } separation; both high adsorption capacities and selectivities were achieved.

40|$|This patent {{describes}} an industrial {{process for the}} direct complete temperature induced transformation (decomposition and recrystallization) of packages of plastic material containing roofing cement-asbestos slates or other asbestos containing wastes such as friable asbestos. The industrial firing process ensures a complete transformation of both the package and the asbestos containing material via a decomposition reaction of the organic compounds and a decomposition and recrystallization of all the inorganic mineral phases including the asbestos minerals. The firing process which ensures the total transformation of the packages and the mineral assemblage including the asbestos phases is accomplished using an industrial <b>continuous</b> tunnel <b>kiln,</b> with a technology comparable to that employed {{for the production of}} bricks or sanitary-wares. The length of the industrial kiln should be within 100 and 150 m to guarantee the proper firing cycle and total decomposition and recrystallization of both the hazardous serpentine and amphibole species of asbestos. The transformation via decomposition and recrystallization of these minerals leads to the formation of non hazardous crystalline Si-, Ca-; Mg-rich silicates. To this aim, the steps of the firing cycle which are required are:Step 1 : a heating non-isothermal run up to the maximum firing temperature of 1200 - 1300 °C not shorter than 8 h;Step 2 : an isotherm at the maximum firing temperature of 1200 - 1300 °C not shorter than 12 h;Step 3 : a slow cooling non-isothermal run down to room temperature not shorter than 6 h. During the firing cycle, the industrial kiln must ensure complete isolation of the packages to be treated from the environment outside the kiln. All the volatile compounds and the asbestos fibres eventually released during the preliminary stage (Step 1) of the firing process inside the kiln will be conveyed to a post-combustion system (a supplementary heater {{at the top of the}} kiln) operating at temperature not lower than 1100 °C, to guarantee their complete thermal transformation and decomposition. The hot smokes and particulate from the post-combustor system will be successively cooled down to a temperature lower than 150 °C to allow the flow through double absolute HEPA filters before they are released in air. This industrial process is highly innovative and unique because it makes possible a safe direct thermal transformation of the packages containing the asbestos materials. The packages are not opened nor mechanically ground before the firing process. In this way, such pre-firing operations, highly dangerous because of possible dispersion of asbestos fibres in air, are avoided. The energy to the kiln will be supplied using natural gas. This industrial system will be capable to operate either with cement-asbestos sheets and friable asbestos and/or synthetic glass/wool fibers. As consequence of the thermal treatment, in agreement with the actual laws concerning the treatment and recycling of transformed asbestos containing wastes (see Table B Italian Minister Decree nr. 248, July 29 th 2004), the product of transformation, composed of a mixture of innocuous non-fibrous crystalline silicates can be milled and recycled as a raw material for the formulation of a number of different industrial products such as traditional ceramics, pigments, cements and bricks...|$|R
