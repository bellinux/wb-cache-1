By the fall of 1961 Ultronics had installed its first desk units (Stockmaster) in New York and Philadelphia, followed by San Francisco and Los Angeles. The Stockmaster desk units offered the user quick access and continuous monitoring of last sale, bid, ask, high, low, total volume, open, close, earnings, and dividends for each stock on the NYSE and the AMEX plus commodities from the various U.S. commodity exchanges. Ultimately Ultronics and General Telephone (which bought Ultronics in 1967) installed some 10,000 units world-wide. In June 1964 Ultronics and the British news company Reuters signed a joint venture agreement to market Stockmaster worldwide outside of North America. This venture lasted for 10 years and was very successful, capturing the worldwide market for U.S. stock and commodity price information.

We have identified five major value‐adding dimensions of information commodities: (1) kernel; (2) storage; (3) processing; (4) distribution; and (5) presentation. The kernel is the (organized) information provided by an <b>information</b> <b>commodity.</b> The storage dimension of an <b>information</b> <b>commodity</b> encompasses both the medium used to store information and the method used {{to gain access to}} it. Computer‐based, as opposed to traditional, commodities can process and reconfigure the information stored within them. Processing adds value by making it possible to transform the kernel. Distribution adds value by making the kernel of an <b>information</b> <b>commodity</b> accessible to the user. Presentation, the final link in the value‐adding chain, involves the display of information in forms suitable to the user. The five value‐added components provide the basis for an analysis of the cost of producing an <b>information</b> <b>commodity.</b> Major steps in the analysis include: (1) Identification of subtasks in the production process.

40|$|AbstractGlobal {{cities are}} the central nodes in global {{networks}} through which <b>commodities,</b> <b>information,</b> capital and people flow. Many governments have {{announced plans to}} assist their cities to become “global cities”. At the same time, the development of low carbon cities is widely considered an important strategic goal of leading cities in tackling the challenges of climate change. However, {{little attention has been}} given to the compatibility of the two development goals. It is necessary to understand the relationships of various critical dimensions of global city rankings and the city's carbon emission need to be understood. This study shows that although a city's carbon emission is an indicator with very low weight in the five global city rankings analyzed in the study, the top ranked global cities are among the cities with the lowest carbon emission. The currently high carbon emission cities can also lead to lower carbon emission by optimizing economic structure, improving R&D sector and quality of life to enhance their global rankings...|$|R
40|$|In {{a society}} in which {{information}} is one of the highest-valued <b>commodities,</b> <b>information</b> networks are the economic backbone. Therefore, network vulnerability is a major hazard. Analysis of communications system traffic suggests that {{there are a variety of}} similar dynamical characteristics in widely varying systems. There are some universal features of communication networks that may determine the main dynamics of communications. These are: 1) hardware limitations on network capacity, 2) forcing from the increasing number of users towards the network capacity, and 3) a high level of complexity in those systems. These common features may drive the system dynamics and determine its main intrinsic vulnerabilities. The nontrivial character of network dynamics has already been found in traffic analysis of local area networks that display self-similarities and long-range correlations. This suggests a complex dynamics in the traffic of packets over the network. In this work simple distribution network models with different levels of complexity are examined and compared to each other and to characteristics of real Internet data...|$|R
40|$|The {{significance}} of national borders {{has been called}} into question by the corrosive consequence of accelerated globalisation. Many commentators have assumed that intensified worldwide inter-connections and time-space compression entail a decline in state capacities and an increased permeability of their borders. Trans-national flows of capital, <b>commodities,</b> <b>information</b> and people, so the argument runs, have undermined the ability of states to regulate activities within and across their borders. In short, a ‘deterritorialised’, ‘borderless’ world is invoked which, it is claimed, fundamentally transforms economic, political and cultural realities. This paper critically examines this thesis, rejects its strongest version {{and goes on to}} argue for the continued relevance of national borders - as demarcating dejure sovereignty, as regulators of movement, as markers of citizenship rights, and as instruments for the classification of populations and the reproduction of identities. It claims that borders have been reconfigured rather than uniformly eroded, that their permeability is highly differentiated, and that this permeability reflects and reinforces the power relations of uneven globalisation. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor a multiple-segment flight with {{passenger}} aircraft, {{the primary}} objective of commodity load planning {{is to improve the}} operational efficiency while satisfying the constraints of weight and balance, aircraft structure limitation and flight safety.

The flexibility, stability and efficiency of the system were illustrated by real cases studies from the client.

An effective algorithm, i. e. Chinese Commodity Review Miner (CCRM) is proposed. The algorithm can be divided into two parts. First, we propose an efficient rule based algorithm for commodity feature extraction as well as a probabilistic model for feature ranking. Second, we propose a top-to-down algorithm to reorganize the extracted features into hierarchical structure. A prototype system based on CCRM is also implemented. Using CCRM, users can easily acquire the outline of a commodity, and navigate freely in it...|$|E
