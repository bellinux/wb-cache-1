40|$|For many years, {{chlorofluorocarbon}} (CFC) and <b>chlorocarbon</b> solvents {{have played}} {{an important part in}} aerospace operations. These solvents found extensive use as cleaning and analysis (EPA) solvents in precision and critical cleaning. However, CFCs and <b>chlorocarbon</b> solvents have deleterious effects on the ozone layer, are relatively strong greenhouse gases, and some are suspect or known carcinogens. Because of their ozone-depletion potential (ODP), the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, as well as other environmental regulations, have resulted in the phaseout of CFC- 113 and 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA). Although alternatives have been recommended, they do not perform as well as the original solvents. In addition, some analyses, such as the infrared analysis of extracted hydrocarbons, cannot be performed with the substitute solvents that contain C-H bonds. CFC- 113 solvent has been used for many critical aerospace applications. CFC- 113, also known as Freon (registered) TF, has been used extensively in NASA's cleaning facilities for precision and critical cleaning, in particular the final rinsing in Class 100 areas, with gas chromatography analysis of rinse residue. While some cleaning can be accomplished by other processes, there are certain critical applications where CFC- 113 or a similar solvent is highly cost-effective and ensures safety. Oxygen system components are one example where a solvent compatible with oxygen and capable of removing fluorocarbon grease is needed.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{in detail the}} instrumentation and calibrations used in the ALE, GAGE and AGAGE experiments and present {{a history of the}} majority of the anthropogenic ozone- depleting and climate-forcing gases in air based on these experiments. Beginning in 1978, these three successive automated high frequency in-situ experiments have documented the long-term behavior of the measured concentrations of these gases over the past twenty years, and show both the evolution of latitudinal gradients and the high frequency variability due to sources and circulation. We provide estimates of the long-term trends in total chlorine contained in long- lived halocarbons involved in ozone depletion. We summarize interpretations of these measurements using inverse methods to determine trace gas lifetimes and emissions. Finally, we provide a combined observational and modeled reconstruction of the evolution of chlorocarbons by latitude in the atmosphere over the past sixty years which can be used as boundary conditions for interpreting trapped air in glaciers and oceanic measurements of <b>chlorocarbon</b> tracers of the deep oceanic circulation. Some specific conclusions are: (a) International compliance with the Montreal Protocol is so far resulting in chlorofluorocarbon and <b>chlorocarbon</b> mole fractions comparable to target levels, (b) Mole fractions of total chlorine contained in long-lived halocarbons (CCl 2 F 2, CCl 3 F, CH 3 CCl 3, CCl 4, CHClF 2, CCl 2 FCClF 2, CH 3 Cl, CH 2 Cl 2, CHCl 3, CCl 2 =CCl 2) in the lower troposphere reached maximum values of about 3. 6 ppb in 1993 and are beginning to slowly decrease in the global lower atmosphere, (c) The chlorofluorocarbons have atmospheric lifetimes consistent with destruction in the stratosphere being their principal removal mechanism, (d) Multi-annual variations in chlorofluorocarbon and <b>chlorocarbon</b> emissions deduced from ALUGAGWAGAGE data are consistent approximately with variations estimated independently from industrial production and sales data where available (CCl 2 F 2 (CFC- 12) and CCl 2 FCClF 2 (CFC- 113) show the greatest discrepancies), (e) The mole fractions of the hydrochlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, which are replacing the regulated halocarbons, are rising very rapidly in the atmosphere but, with the exception of the much longer manufactured CHClF 2 (HCFC- 22), they are not yet at levels sufficient to contribute significantly to atmospheric chlorine loading. These replacement species could in the future provide independent estimates of the global weighted-average OH concentration provided their industrial emissions are accurately documented, (f) In the future, analysis of pollution events measured using high frequency in-situ measurements of chlorofluorocarbons and their replacements may enable emission estimates at the regional level which, together with industrial end-use data, are of sufficient accuracy to be capable of identifying regional non-compliance with the Montreal Protocol...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The four {{chlorinated}} methanes, {{methyl chloride}} (CH 3 Cl), methylene chloride (CH 2 Cl 2), chloroform (CHCl 3), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4), {{were used as}} model <b>chlorocarbon</b> systems with Cl/H ratios of 0. 021 to 0. 083 to investigate the thermal stability and hydrodechlorination of chloromethanes in excess hydrogen. The pyrolytic reactions were studied in an isothermal tubular reactor at a total pressure of 1 atm with reaction times of 0. 3 ∼ 2. 0 s at temperatures between 525 and 900 oC. The thermal stabilities of the chloromethanes, i. e., the temperatures for 99 % destruction within a reaction time of 1 s were 875 oC for CH 3 Cl, 780 oC for CH 2 Cl 2, 675 oC for CHCl 3, and 635 oC for CCl 4. The less-chlorinated hydrocarbons were more stable, with CH 3 Cl the most stable <b>chlorocarbon</b> in this reaction system. This work focused on pyrolysis of CH 3 Cl in an ex-cess-hydrogen reaction atmosphere. The observed hydrodechlorinated products were CH 4, C 2 H 4, and C 2 H 6 at temperatures above 850 oC in the CH 3 Cl/H 2 reaction system. The number and quantities of intermediate chlori-nated products decreased with increasing temperature; the formation of non-chlorinated hydrocarbons in-creased as the temperature rose. One of main pathways for hydrodechlorinated products resulted from H atom cyclic chain reaction by abstraction. Product distributions along with preliminary activation energies and rate constants are reported. The pyrolytic reaction pathways that describe the important features of reagent decay and intermediate product distributions, based upon thermochemical and kinetic principles, are suggested...|$|E
