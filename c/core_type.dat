25|$|Maffei 1 is {{a massive}} {{elliptical}} galaxy classified as type E3 in the Hubble classification scheme. This means that it is slightly flattened, its semi-minor axis being 70% of its semi-major axis. Maffei 1 has also a boxy shape (E(b)3 type), while its central region (radius ≈ 34pc) is deficient in light emission {{as compared to the}} r1/4 law, meaning that Maffei 1 is a <b>core</b> <b>type</b> elliptical. Both the boxy shape and the presence of an underluminous core are typical of intermediate to massive ellipticals.|$|E

5000|$|Most, but not all, Enneagram of Personality theorists {{teach that}} a person's basic type is modified, {{at least to}} some extent, by the {{personality}} dynamics of the two adjacent types as indicated on the enneagram figure. These two types are often called [...] "wings". A person of the Three personality type, for example, is understood to have points Two and Four as their wing types. The circle of the enneagram figure may indicate that the types or points exist on a spectrum rather than as distinct types or points unrelated to those adjacent to them. A person may be understood, therefore, to have a <b>core</b> <b>type</b> and one or two wing types that influence but do not change the <b>core</b> <b>type.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Aside {{from the}} method of {{coupling}} energy into the mercury vapor, these lamps {{are very similar to}} conventional fluorescent lamps. Mercury vapor in the discharge vessel is electrically excited to produce short-wave ultraviolet light, which then excites internal phosphors to produce visible light. While still relatively unknown to the public, these lamps have been available since 1990. Unlike an incandescent lamp or conventional fluorescent lamps, there is no electrical connection going inside the glass bulb; the energy is transferred through the glass envelope solely by electromagnetic induction.There are two main types of magnetic induction lamps: external core lamps and internal core lamps. The first commercially available and still widely used form of induction lamp is the internal <b>core</b> <b>type.</b> The external <b>core</b> <b>type,</b> which was commercialized later, has a wider range of applications and is available in round, rectangular and [...] "olive" [...] shaped form factors.|$|E

In friction spinning, the fibres are applied twist with more or less {{one at a time}} without cyclic differentials in tension in the twisting zone.

50|$|In <b>core</b> <b>type</b> theory, {{induction}} and recursion {{principles are}} used to prove theorems about inductive types. In Agda, dependently typed pattern matching is used instead.

In Agda, dependently typed pattern matching is a primitive of the language; the core language lacks the induction/recursion principles that pattern matching translates to.|$|E

50|$|In <b>core</b> <b>type</b> {{friction}} spinning, the core, {{made of a}} filament or {{a bundle}} of staple fibres, is false twisted by the spinning drum. The sheath fibres are deposited on the false twisted core surface and are wrapped helically over the core with varying helix angles. It is believed that the false twist in the core gets removed once the yarn is emerged from the spinning drums, so that this yarn has a virtually twist-less core. However, {{it is quite possible}} for some amount of false twist to remain {{in the fact that the}} sheath entraps it during yarn formation in the spinning zone.|$|E
