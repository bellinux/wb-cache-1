Spatial tag is similar to fiducial tag used by tangible tabletop surface interaction, and uses multi-point, geometric patterns to encode object IDs. Frequency tag simulates high-frequency touches in the time domain to encode object IDs, using modulation circuits embedded inside tangible objects to simulate high-speed touches in varying frequency. We will show several demo applications. The first combines simultaneous tangible + touch input system.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{application}} of depth-sensing cameras to detect touch on a tabletop. Limits of depth estimate resolution and line of sight requirements dictate that {{the determination of the}} moment of touch will not be as precise as that of more direct sensing techniques such as <b>capacitive</b> <b>touch</b> <b>screens.</b> However, using a depth-sensing camera to detect touch has significant advantages: first, the interactive surface need not be instrumented. Secondly, this approach allows touch sensing on non-flat surfaces. Finally, information about the shape of the users and their arms and hands above the surface may be exploited in useful ways, such as determining hover state, or that multiple touches are from same hand or from the same user.

40|$|Desktop computing—controlling a {{graphical}} {{user interfaces}} with a keyboard and mouse—was developed in the 1960 s and came to prominence in the 1980 s. At the time, the low input bandwidth of keyboard and mouse perfectly matched the low processing power of computers. The desktop interface brilliantly took advantage of what that input could provide to build a powerful, extensible graphical user interface. While input technology (e. g., <b>capacitive</b> <b>touch</b> <b>screens)</b> and processing power to interpret more complex data (e. g., real-time image processing) has advanced tremendously in the forty years since {{the introduction of the}} mouse and keyboard combination, desktop computing has perpetuated the mouse and keyboard as primary input devices. Recently, alternative computing technologies have started to rely on more sophisticated input and processing to enable more natural user interfaces—where the computer processes complex input to correctly interpret user intent to create a more intuitive interface (Wigdor and Wixon, 2011).

40|$|Touch input is the {{dominant}} input method on mobile devices these days. Interactive desk workspaces are {{a way to bring}} touch to the workplace using large interactive touch surfaces that allow users to directly manipulate digital content by touching it. In contrast to its success on mobile platforms, touch input has not explored its full potential on desktop workspaces. We believe this is because of two main reasons: First, similar to touch on mobile devices, interactive desktop workspaces lack haptic feedback when interacting with the surface. Second, large interactive surfaces pose ergonomic challenges. If oriented vertically, like the existing displays in a desk workspace, direct interaction is cumbersome and fatiguing since it requires users to constantly hold their arms in the air. However, if the touch surfaces are oriented horizontally, constantly looking at them is uncomfortable and leads to neck pain. This thesis aims to explore interactive desk workspaces by overcoming both of these issues. To overcome the ergonomic challenges of large interactive surfaces we present BendDesk, an interactive desk workspace that combines a horizontal and a vertical interactive surface into one large desk workspace. In our in-depth analysis, we show that combining both surfaces has numerous benefits, but the issues with direct interaction on a vertical surface still prevail. Based on the results of this analysis, we improve our system by bringing the concept of indirect touch to the desk workspace. This interaction technique allows users to comfortably interact with digital content on the vertical surface through touch input on the horizontal surface, maintaining most of the benefits of touch input. Furthermore, we utilize the user’s gaze to allow them to easily switch between direct and indirect touch input. To overcome the limited haptic feedback of <b>touch</b> <b>screens,</b> we introduce PERCs tangible, physical objects that allow users to manipulate digital content displayed on <b>capacitive</b> <b>touch</b> <b>screens</b> without the need to look at it...|$|R
