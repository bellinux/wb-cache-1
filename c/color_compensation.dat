Color changes due to light attenuated for different wavelength. This paper proposes a novel systematic approach to enhance underwater images by a dehazing algorithm, {{to compensate the}} attenuation discrepancy along the propagation path, and to take {{the influence of the}} possible presence of an artificial light source into consideration. Once the depth map, i. e., distances between the objects and the camera, is estimated,the foreground and background within a scene are segmented. The light intensities of foreground and background are compared to determine whether an artificial light source is employed during the image capturing process. After compensating the effect of artificial light, the haze phenomenon and discrepancy in wavelength attenuation along the underwater propagation path to camera are corrected. Next, the water depth in the image scene is estimated according to the residual energy ratios of different color channels existing in the background light. Based on the amount of attenuation corresponding to each light wavelength, <b>color</b> change <b>compensation</b> is conducted to restore color balance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} efficient <b>color</b> and lumi-nance <b>compensation</b> approach for image sequences for con-structing panoramic images on mobile devices. In this ap-proach, constant compensation coefficients for adjacent im-ages are computed from the corresponding pixels in the over-lapping areas of the adjacent images in the linearized RGB color space. A global adjustment for all compensation coeffi-cients is performed so that the correction for each image is as small as possible. This can smooth color transition between adjacent images in the image sequence globally and reduce cumulative errors in the color correction process. The com-pensation coefficients, together with the global adjustment factor, are applied to correct color and luminance of source images in the image sequence before they are stitched into a panoramic image. Our algorithm is not sensitive {{to the quality of}} spatial registration since it does not need exact pixel correspon-dences between the overlapped images. The computation of compensation coefficients for each adjacent image takes the gamma correction factor into account, producing better re-sults. Running the method separately on the three channels matches the color balance that may not match due to auto-white-balancing algorithm. A global adjustment for the <b>compensation</b> coefficients minimizes <b>color</b> transitions and re-duces cumulative errors.

40|$|UnrestrictedSeveral {{challenging}} {{issues for}} applications of image/video mosaicking and upsampling with high resolution are addressed here, {{all of which}} are mainly conducted in DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) domain so that lower computation complexity can be achieved.; First of all, <b>color</b> matching and <b>compensation</b> techniques are proposed to remove the seam lines between image boundaries due to the different color tones of the inputs. Color deviation of each input image is corrected first and color differences between input images are then compensated using the polynomial-based contrast stretching technique. The proposed approach is attractive for its lower computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the color-matching problem can be satisfactorily solved in the compressed domain even when the DCT blocks of original input images are not aligned.; Two block-level image registration techniques for compressed video such as motion JPEG or the I-picture of MPEG are investigated. The proposed methods are based on edge estimation and extraction in DCT domain so that the computational cost of image registration is reduced dramatically while achieving certain quality of composition. In order to reach higher accuracy of registration, hybrid block/pixel level alignment, is proposed so that the displacement vector resolution can be enhanced from the block level to the pixel level. The inverse DCT transform is not performed to the whole image but only to some selected blocks. It is shown by experiments that the proposed algorithm saves around 40 % of the computational complexity while achieving the same quality.; In the last part, a content adaptive technique is proposed to upsample an image to an output image of higher resolution. The proposed technique is a block-based processing algorithm that offers the flexibility in choosing the most suitable up-sampling method for a particular block type. Block classfication is fist conducted in the DCT domain to categorize each image block into several types: smooth areas, textures, edges and others. For the plain background and smooth surfaces, simple patches are used to enlarge the image size without degrading the resultant visual quality. The unsharp masking method is applied to the textured region to preserve high frequency components. Since human eyes are more sensitive to edges, we adopt a more sophisticated technique to process edge blocks. That is, they are approximated by a facet model so that the image data at subpixel positions can be generated accordingly. A post-processing technique such as 1 D directional unsharp masking can be used to enhance edge sharpness furthermore. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed techniques...|$|R
