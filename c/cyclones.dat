5|$|An area {{prone to}} <b>cyclones</b> and storm surges, Sitakunda was {{affected}} by <b>cyclones</b> in 1960, 1963, 1970, 1988, 1991, 1994 and 1997; the <b>cyclones</b> of 29 May 1963, 12 November 1970, 29 April 1991 made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical <b>cyclones</b> form {{anywhere}} {{within the}} extratropical {{regions of the}} Earth (usually between 30° and 60° latitude from the equator), either through cyclogenesis or extratropical transition. A study of extratropical <b>cyclones</b> in the Southern Hemisphere shows that between the 30th and 70th parallels, there are an average of 37 <b>cyclones</b> in existence during any 6-hour period. A separate study in the Northern Hemisphere suggests that approximately 234 significant extratropical <b>cyclones</b> form each winter.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical <b>cyclones,</b> {{sometimes}} called mid-latitude <b>cyclones</b> or wave <b>cyclones,</b> are low-pressure areas which, {{along with the}} anticyclones of high-pressure areas, drive the weather {{over much of the}} Earth. Extratropical <b>cyclones</b> are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild showers to heavy gales, thunderstorms, blizzards, and tornadoes. These types of <b>cyclones</b> are defined as large scale (synoptic) low pressure weather systems that occur in the middle latitudes of the Earth. In contrast with tropical <b>cyclones,</b> extratropical <b>cyclones</b> produce rapid changes in temperature and dew point along broad lines, called weather fronts, about the center of the cyclone.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} to {{analysis}} <b>cyclone</b> pressure drop is reported. The frictional pressure loss {{is the primary}} pressure loss in a <b>cyclone.</b> The air stream travel distance {{is a function of}} <b>cyclone</b> diameter. The frictional pressure loss is independent of a <b>cyclone</b> diameter, therefore <b>cyclone</b> total pressure loss is independent of <b>cyclone</b> diameter...|$|R
500|$|Severe Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> John was {{an intense}} {{tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> that rapidly deepened offshore before devastating areas of Western Australia. The system {{was the second}} <b>cyclone</b> and first severe tropical <b>cyclone</b> of the active 1999–00 Australian region <b>cyclone</b> season. <b>Cyclone</b> John developed from a monsoon trough positioned northwest of Australia on 9 December 1999. As it moved {{to the west and}} later south {{as the result of a}} subtropical ridge under favourable conditions, the <b>cyclone</b> was able to rapidly intensify. John reached peak intensity on 14 December as a Category5 <b>cyclone</b> on the Australian <b>cyclone</b> scale, the highest rating possible. <b>Cyclone</b> John later began interacting with a mid–latitude trough, which slightly weakened the <b>cyclone</b> prior to making landfall near Whim Creek early on 15 December. Increasingly unfavourable conditions further inland resulted in the <b>cyclone's</b> rapid weakening, before it dissipated during [...] the next day.|$|R
5000|$|The 1989-90 Australian region <b>cyclone</b> {{season was}} an above average {{tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> season. It {{was also an}} event in the ongoing cycle of tropical <b>cyclone</b> formation. It ran from 1 November 1989 to 30 April 1990. The regional tropical <b>cyclone</b> operational plan also defines a tropical <b>cyclone</b> year separately from a tropical <b>cyclone</b> season, and the [...] "tropical <b>cyclone</b> year" [...] ran from 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1990.|$|R
5|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. <b>Cyclones</b> are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical <b>cyclones</b> of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core <b>cyclones</b> such as tropical <b>cyclones</b> and subtropical <b>cyclones</b> also lie within the synoptic scale.|$|E
5|$|The South Pacific Ocean basin runs between 160°E and 120°W, with {{tropical}} <b>cyclones</b> {{developing in}} it officially {{monitored by the}} Fiji Meteorological Service and New Zealand's MetService. Tropical <b>Cyclones</b> that develop within this basin generally affect countries {{to the west of}} the dateline, though during El Niños <b>cyclones</b> have been known to develop to the east of the dateline near French Polynesia. On average the basin sees nine tropical <b>cyclones</b> annually with about half of them becoming severe tropical <b>cyclones.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{period from}} 2000 {{to the present}} was marked by several devastating North Atlantic hurricanes; , 79 {{tropical}} or subtropical <b>cyclones</b> have affected the U.S. state of Florida. Collectively, <b>cyclones</b> in Florida over that period resulted in over $73 billion in damage (2017USD). Additionally, tropical <b>cyclones</b> in Florida were responsible for 147 direct fatalities and at least 92 indirect ones during the period. Eight <b>cyclones</b> affected the state in both 2003 and 2005, which were the years with the most tropical <b>cyclones</b> impacting the state. Every year included at least one tropical cyclone affecting the state.|$|E
25|$|At that time, <b>Cyclone</b> Ron was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> ever recorded in the South Pacific basin, with a lowest central pressure estimated at 900hPa (26.58inHg), {{but now it is}} the third most intense, only behind 2002's <b>Cyclone</b> Zoe and 2015's <b>Cyclone</b> Pam and tied with its twin, <b>Cyclone</b> Susan and 2005's <b>Cyclone</b> Percy.|$|R
5000|$|The 1996-97 Australian region <b>cyclone</b> {{season was}} an above average {{tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> season. It ran from 1 November 1996 to 30 April 1996.

5|$|Severe Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> Gene was {{the deadliest}} storm {{as well as}} the most {{damaging}} tropical <b>cyclone</b> of the 2007–08 South Pacific <b>cyclone</b> season east of 160ºE. RSMC Nadi monitored Gene as the 12th tropical disturbance, {{as well as the}} fourth tropical <b>cyclone</b> and the third severe tropical <b>cyclone</b> to form west of 160ºE during the 2007–08 South Pacific <b>cyclone</b> season. Gene was also recognised by RSMC Nadi as the fifth tropical <b>cyclone</b> and fourth severe tropical <b>cyclone</b> to form within the South Pacific Ocean during the 2007-08 season.|$|R
5|$|A {{subtropical}} cyclone is {{a weather}} {{system that has}} some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. They can form between the equator and the 50th parallel. As early as the 1950s, meteorologists were unclear whether they should be characterized as tropical <b>cyclones</b> or extratropical <b>cyclones,</b> and used terms such as quasi-tropical and semi-tropical to describe the cyclone hybrids. By 1972, the National Hurricane Center officially recognized this cyclone category. Subtropical <b>cyclones</b> began to receive names off the official tropical cyclone list in the Atlantic Basin in 2002. They have broad wind patterns with maximum sustained winds located farther from the center than typical tropical <b>cyclones,</b> and exist in areas of weak to moderate temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|Alice formed {{later in}} the {{calendar}} year than any Atlantic tropical cyclone on record, forming six hours {{later in the}} season than Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Alice was one of only eight Atlantic tropical <b>cyclones</b> to form in the month of December. Alice was the first of two Atlantic tropical <b>cyclones</b> to exist in two calendar years, the other being 2005's Zeta. The hurricane was also one of only six tropical or subtropical <b>cyclones</b> to exist in the month of January and the strongest to do so.|$|E
5|$|An {{average of}} 86 {{tropical}} <b>cyclones</b> of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical <b>cyclones</b> (at least Category 3 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale).|$|E
5000|$|The 2012-13 Australian region <b>cyclone</b> {{season was}} a {{slightly}} below average tropical <b>cyclone</b> season {{event in the}} ongoing cycle of tropical <b>cyclone</b> formation. It officially started on 1 November 2012, and officially ended on 30 April 2013, despite <b>Cyclone</b> Zane being an active system at the time (it dissipated a day later on 1 May). The regional tropical <b>cyclone</b> operational plan defines a [...] "tropical <b>cyclone</b> year" [...] separately from a [...] "tropical <b>cyclone</b> season"; the [...] "tropical <b>cyclone</b> year" [...] began on 1 July 2012 and ended on 30 June 2013.|$|R
50|$|The 2007-08 Australian region <b>cyclone</b> {{season was}} a {{slightly}} below average tropical <b>cyclone</b> season. The season {{got off to}} an early start with the formation on 29 July of the first Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> which was not upgraded operationally to a <b>cyclone</b> but was later upgraded to a <b>Cyclone</b> during post storm analysis. This {{was the second time}} that a tropical <b>Cyclone</b> had formed during the month of July. The other one was <b>Cyclone</b> Lindsay in the 1996-1997 season. The next <b>cyclone</b> that formed was <b>Cyclone</b> Guba which formed on 13 November with TCWC Port Moresby assigning the name Guba on 14 November which was the first named storm within TCWC Port Moresby's area of responsibility since <b>Cyclone</b> Epi in June 2003. Guba was also the first <b>cyclone</b> to occur in the Queensland region in the month of November since 1977.|$|R
50|$|Intense Tropical <b>Cyclone</b> Giovanna was a {{powerful}} tropical <b>cyclone</b> that affected Madagascar. Giovanna was the ninth tropical depression, seventh named storm and third tropical <b>cyclone</b> of the 2011-12 South-West Indian Ocean <b>cyclone</b> season. Giovanna is still blamed for 33 deaths along the Madagascar coast, {{and it is the}} first intense tropical <b>cyclone</b> to impact Madagascar, since <b>Cyclone</b> Bingiza in February 2011.|$|R
5|$|As Christopher Landsea et al. point out, many {{tropical}} <b>cyclones</b> {{that formed}} {{on the open}} sea and did not affect any coast usually went undetected prior to satellite observation since the 1970s. They estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical <b>cyclones</b> per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly {{take into account the}} typical size of tropical <b>cyclones,</b> the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E
5|$|Because of a weak–moderate La Niña episode, most {{tropical}} <b>cyclones</b> {{that developed}} within the season occurred within the Coral Sea. The weak La Nina conditions also affected {{the amount of}} tropical <b>cyclones</b> {{that occurred during the}} year, with only 5 tropical <b>cyclones</b> occurring within the basin. During December 24, Tropical Cyclone Gertie moved into the basin from the Australian region, before it passed to the south of New Caledonia and weakened below tropical cyclone intensity.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970-2004, inland {{flooding}} from tropical <b>cyclones</b> {{caused a}} majority of the fatalities in the United States. This statistic changed in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina's impact alone shifted the most deadly aspect of tropical <b>cyclones</b> back to storm surge, which has historically been the most deadly aspect of strong tropical <b>cyclones.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most intense}} {{tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> in the South-West Indian Ocean is <b>Cyclone</b> Gafilo. By 10-minute sustained wind speed, the strongest tropical <b>cyclone</b> in the South-West Indian Ocean is <b>Cyclone</b> Fantala.|$|R
5|$|<b>Cyclone</b> Percy was {{the seventh}} named storm of the 2004–05 South Pacific <b>cyclone</b> {{season and the}} fourth and final severe {{tropical}} <b>cyclone</b> to form during the 2004–05 South Pacific <b>cyclone</b> season.|$|R
50|$|<b>Cyclone</b> George was {{the most}} {{powerful}} <b>cyclone</b> to hit Port Hedland since <b>Cyclone</b> Joan in 1975. Three {{people were killed and}} twenty-eight others were injured {{as a result of the}} severe <b>cyclone.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Cyclones</b> Gwenda (1999) and Inigo (2003), {{tied for}} the strongest Australian region {{tropical}} <b>cyclones</b> on record; both would strike Western Australia after peaking in strength.|$|E
5|$|Data from South American {{tropical}} <b>cyclones</b> is sparse and incomplete, {{though most}} tropical <b>cyclones</b> that struck the continent caused multiple deaths. Bret, Joan, Cesar, Gilbert, Catarina, and Ivan all caused their deaths through rainfall or flash flooding.|$|E

5|$|During November 2002, New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research {{predicted}} {{that there would}} be an eastwards shift in activity during the season, with more tropical <b>cyclones</b> than normal expected to the east of the date line, due to well established weak to moderate El Niño conditions. As a result, the island nations of Wallis and Futuna, Niue, Samoa, Tokelau, and the Southern Cook Islands were predicted to experience a higher than average number of tropical <b>cyclones.</b> The Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga, French Polynesia, New Zealand and the Northern Cook Islands were predicted to experience an average number of tropical <b>cyclones,</b> while Southern Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and New Caledonia were predicted to experience a reduced number of tropical <b>cyclones.</b> In January 2003, NIWA issued an updated outlook, listing the Northern Cook Islands and French Polynesia as areas predicted to experience an above average number of tropical <b>cyclones.</b> In contrast, Vanuatu was predicted to experience below average cyclone activity. The Solomon Islands and Tonga were now predicted to experience a reduced number of tropical <b>cyclones,</b> with all other countries expected to face the same risk as the November outlook.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical <b>cyclones</b> {{begin as}} waves along weather fronts before {{occluding}} later {{in their life}} cycle as cold-core systems. However, some intense extratropical <b>cyclones</b> can become warm-core systems when a warm seclusion occurs.|$|E
5|$|Few storms formed this season, but it {{was very}} eventful. Twelve {{tropical}} <b>cyclones</b> formed during this season, of which five made landfall and two other impacted land areas. Two tropical <b>cyclones</b> that formed in other basins entered the eastern north Pacific Ocean. Early in the season three tropical <b>cyclones</b> impacted Mexico in a ten-day span, while the first cyclone of the season formed before it officially began. Hurricane Douglas was the strongest storm, reaching Category4 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and had its beginnings in the Atlantic as Hurricane Cesar.|$|E
