5|$|The HDMI founders began {{development}} on HDMI 1.0 on April 16, 2002, {{with the goal}} of creating an AV connector that was backward-compatible with DVI. At the time, DVI-HDCP (DVI with HDCP) and DVI-HDTV (DVI-HDCP using the CEA-861-B video standard) were being used on HDTVs. HDMI 1.0 was designed to improve on DVI-HDTV by using a smaller connector and adding audio capability and enhanced YCbCr capability and <b>consumer</b> <b>electronics</b> <b>control</b> functions.|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{implements}} the EIA/CEA-861 standards, which define video formats and waveforms, {{transport of}} compressed, uncompressed, and LPCM audio, auxiliary data, and implementations of the VESA EDID.

No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. The CEC (<b>Consumer</b> <b>Electronics</b> <b>Control)</b> capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld remote control device.|$|E

A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise {{would not be able to}} reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.|$|R
2500|$|Technicolor (formerly called Thomson <b>Consumer</b> <b>Electronics)</b> {{claimed to}} <b>control</b> MP3 {{licensing}} of the Layer 3 patents in many countries, including the United States, Japan, Canada and EU countries. Technicolor had been actively enforcing these patents. MP3 license revenues from Technicolor's administration generated about â‚¬100 {{million for the}} Fraunhofer Society in 2005. In September 1998, the Fraunhofer Institute {{sent a letter to}} several developers of MP3 software stating that a license was required to [...] "distribute and/or sell decoders and/or encoders". The letter claimed that unlicensed products [...] "infringe the patent rights of Fraunhofer and Thomson. To make, sell or distribute products using the [...] standard and thus our patents, you need to obtain a license under these patents from us." [...] This led to the situation where the LAME MP3 encoder project could not offer its users official binaries that could run on their computer. The project's position was that as source code, LAME was simply a description of how an MP3 encoder could be implemented. Unofficially, compiled binaries were available from other sources.|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of frequency separation is a design method to display different information or feedback {{in accordance with}} the frequency of interaction between users and systems. This principle can be usefully applied to the design of knobs. Particularly, their rotation speed can be a meaningful criterion for applying the principle. Hence a knob can be developed, which shows change rates varying depending on its rotation speed. Such a knob would be more efficient than conventional knobs with constant change rate. We developed a prototype of frequency-separated knobs that has different combinations of the number of rotation speed steps {{and the size of the}} variation of change rate. With this prototype, we conducted an experiment to examine whether a speed frequency-separated knob enhances users' task performance. The results showed that the newly designed knob was effective in enhancing task performance, and that task efficiency was the best when its change rate increases exponentially and its rotation speed has three steps. We conducted another experiment to investigate how a more rapid exponential increase of change rate and a more number of steps of rotation speed influence users' task performance. The results showed that merely increasing both the size of the variation of change rates and the number of speed steps did not result in better task performance. Although two experimental results cannot easily be generalized to other contexts, they still offer practical information useful for designing a speed frequency-separated knob in various <b>consumer</b> <b>electronics</b> and <b>control</b> panels of industrial systems...|$|R
