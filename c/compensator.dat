5|$|The P90 {{requires}} minimal maintenance, {{and it can}} be disassembled {{quickly and}} easily. It is a modular firearm, consisting of four main component groups: the barrel and optical sight group, the moving parts group, the frame and trigger group, and the hammer group. The P90's barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of 263mm (10.4in). The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231mm (1:9.1in), and it is equipped with a diagonally cut flash suppressor that also acts as a recoil <b>compensator.</b> The stated service life of the barrel is 20,000 rounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{buoyancy}} of a diving cylinder during the dive {{can be more}} problematic with side-mounted cylinders, and the actual buoyancy at any point during the dive is a consideration with any cylinder that may {{be separated from the}} diver for any reason. Cylinders which will be stage-dropped or handed off to another diver should not change the diver's buoyancy beyond what can be compensated using their buoyancy <b>compensator.</b> Cylinders with approximately neutral buoyancy when full generally require the least compensation when detached.|$|E
5|$|The loss of {{the weight}} of the gas taken from the {{cylinder}} makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant {{towards the end of the}} dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy <b>compensator</b> to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering) The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is mainly the study of various topologies of force commutated distortion <b>compensators.</b> This is done {{against the background of}} distortion in power systems in general. At the time of the investigation confusion reigned the domein of terminology and definition of power components and power <b>compensators.</b> Part of the investigation was the functional categorizing of power <b>compensators.</b> Forced commutated distortion <b>compensators</b> were then highlighted as element of this suggested frame work. There is a general increase of distortion in power networks which emphasises the limits of passive filters to compensate for non-active power. The use of power converters as forced commutated distortion <b>compensators</b> proves an effective means whereby to counteract these limits. In this document the different topologies of forced commutated distortion <b>compensators</b> are labelled according to the position where the converter is coupled to the network, as well as the characteristics of the energy storage element used. The topologies are studied through modelling, mathematical analysis and simulation. An experimental system of one of the topologies is presented. Control strategies for forced commutated distortion <b>compensators</b> are discussed with emphasis on the control of energy loss in the energy storage elements of the <b>compensators.</b> The investigation is concluded with proposed ideas for futher study as well as a philosophical approach to the role of forced commutated distortion <b>compensators</b> in the future...|$|R
5|$|The pony is {{typically}} a 2- to 5-litre cylinder. Its capacity determines {{the depth of}} dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection. Ponies may be fixed to the diver's buoyancy <b>compensator</b> (BC) or main cylinder behind the diver's back, or can be clipped to the harness at the diver's side or chest or carried as a sling cylinder. Ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency gas supply but require that the diver is trained to use them.|$|E
5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. As divers are seldom weighted to be very negatively buoyant, a positive buoyancy of 50kg is considered adequate by some authorities for general commercial use. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy ay their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy <b>compensator</b> or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack.|$|E

5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy <b>compensator</b> devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E

25|$|A diver {{ballasted}} {{by following}} this procedure will be negatively buoyant {{during most of}} the dive unless the buoyancy <b>compensator</b> is used, to an extent which depends on the amount of breathing gas carried. The buoyancy <b>compensator</b> is partially inflated when needed to support this negative buoyancy, and as breathing gas is used up during the dive, the volume of the buoyancy <b>compensator</b> will be reduced, by venting as required.|$|E

40|$|Phase-wise {{unbalanced}} {{reactive power}} compensations are required in distribution systems for dynamic {{power factor correction}} and terminal voltage stabilization.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of recent flight tests of several anti-windup (AW) <b>compensators</b> on the German Aerospace Centre's (DLR) Advanced Technologies Testing Aircraft (ATTAS).

The AW <b>compensators</b> were assessed based on pilot handling qualities ratings (HQRs) and PIO ratings (PIORs). These ratings, and supporting pilot comments and flight data, demonstrate that the AW <b>compensators</b> improved the handling qualities and reduced the PIO proneness of the aircraft, albeit to different degrees.

40|$|The {{assembly}} of an optical system requires the correction of aberrations {{in the entire}} imaging field by making selected rigid-body motions of the optical elements.

The method finds the smallest number of <b>compensators</b> to correct for misalignments of a given magnitude.

It is shown that out of 32 degrees of freedom in {{the configuration of the}} optical elements, only eight <b>compensators</b> are required on the optics.

Fine tuning of trim can be done by placing smaller weights {{along the length of the}} diver to bring the centre of gravity to the desired position. There are several ways this can be done.|$|E
