40|$|Stylised {{facts on}} UK {{corporate}} financial health: evidence from micro-data Andrew Benito and Gertjan Vlieghe, Domestic Finance Division, Bank of England When firms fail, their creditors usually suffer losses, so anything {{which increases the}} likelihood of corporate failure can heighten the risks faced by the banking system. Past studies of corporate distress have established that profitability, gearing and liquidity are important to the chances of company survival. This article looks at the published accounts of over 1000 companies in each year between 1974 and 1998 to investigate how these indicators of financial health changed. It finds that the variation across companies in profitability and margins increased sharply from 1994 and in <b>capital</b> <b>gearing</b> from 1995. Despite the broadly favourable outlook for the corporate sector as a whole, the least profitable companies in 1998 were much less profitable than even the least profitable companies in the recessions of the early 1980 s and 1990 s. Similarly, the <b>capital</b> <b>gearing</b> of the most highly geared companies reached levels in 1998 not seen in the past quarter-century. These results imply that the downside risks facing creditors of the corporate sector may have been greater in recent years than suggested by aggregate corporate performance alone.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{determinants}} of failure among individual UK public and private companies are examined, over the period from 1991 to 2001. Using information on profitability, interest cover, <b>capital</b> <b>gearing,</b> liquidity, company size, industry, whether a firm is a subsidiary and overall economic conditions, {{it is possible to}} construct estimates of the probability of failure for individual companies. These are used to calculate each company's debt at risk: the probability of failure multiplied by its outstanding debt. By summing the firm-level debt at risk over all companies it is possible to produce an aggregate measure of financial risk that takes account of how debt is distributed across individual companies. Aggregate debt at risk, as a percentage of total debt, has fallen from the levels reached in the early 1990 s and has remained relatively stable despite the build-up in corporate debt since then. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the inter‐relationship between profitability, {{cost of capital}} and capital structure among property developers and contractors in Hong Kong. Whilst major indigenous local developers are among the largest and the most profitable in the world, their contractor counterparts are generally small and nowhere near as profitable. An analysis of financial data suggests that gearing is generally higher among contractors than developers. However, {{it does not mean}} that contractors borrow more than developers. Indeed they do not need to borrow as much as developers even if they have the assets to pledge as collateral. Contractors do not have to pay for high land costs, and they obtain project finance from developers through interim payments in lump sum contracts that are widely adopted in the industry. Their high gearing reflects more their low equity base than high level of debts. Their costs of equities are about double the developers’, probably due to their usually low or negative profit margins. This conclusion is substantiated by further regression analysis of the data. The findings indicate that <b>capital</b> <b>gearing</b> is positively related with asset but negatively with profit margins. This article concludes with a discussion on implications of such profitability divide between the two sectors on the unequal relationship between developers and contractors, and on their competitiveness.

Findings – The results reveal a significantly positive relation between the ratio of short-term debt to total assets and ROE. However, a negative relationship between the ratio of long-term debt to total assets and ROE was found. With regard to the relationship between total debt and return rates, the results show a significantly positive association between the ratio of total debt to total assets and return on equity.

The Foundation Center and the European Foundation Centre are pleased to partner with Lucy to offer this toolkit as a GrantCraft guide. The Blueprint {{provides an overview of}} the current landscape, points to major trends, and directs your attention to horizons where you can expect some important breakthroughs in the coming year. What's in the Guide? What Is the Social Economy? The social economy is one way of thinking about all of the tools we use to apply our private resources for public good. Where once this was largely the domain of charitable gifts to nonprofit organizations, we now use social businesses, impact investing, campaign contributions, social welfare organizations, peer-to-peer giving, crowdfunding platforms, and informal networks to make the change we want. Insight: Big Shifts that Matter: A "digital infrastructure" is emerging for the social economy and individual actors are contributing to it, using it, and changing their work because of it. This section examines three implications of data [...] starting with new sharing practices by big foundations. It also discusses the rise of mobile payments as a means of individual giving, and the critical responsibilities of social economy enterprises regarding transparency and privacy.

40|$|In {{open access}} marine fisheries, the non-targeted catches {{in the form}} of juveniles are detrimental, as this would reduce future yield and {{subsequent}} recruitment to the fishery. The proliferating impact of juvenile fishing is much more intense in a multi-gear multi-species fishery like Indian marine fisheries, where intra- and inter-sectoral conflicts exist. Marine fishing in India is contributing significantly to the country’s economic growth and the coastal livelihood security. Although the recent changes in the techno-harvesting pattern of inshore fisheries of the country has led to a remarkable increase in fish landings, the problem of by-catch and targeted juvenile fishing is ever increasing. The present analysis shows that the contribution {{in the form of}} annual average profit by various craft–gear combinations is often not sufficient to compensate the overall loss generated by the same to the fishery through the harvest of juvenile fishes. Even though the fishermen gain some transient economic incentives from the juveniles landed, the estimated economic loss calculated was at about US 19, 445 million year− 1 from the mechanised as well as motorised sector. Both intergenerational and conventional discounting was applied to show the net present value (NPV) of future loss due to juvenile fishing. Some of the less <b>capital</b> intensive <b>gears</b> also substantially contribute towards the economic deficit caused by juvenile fishing. We suggest that, while considering the ecosystem impacts of accidental by-catch and intentional juvenile fishing, the economic impacts also should be taken into account prior to formulating any management measures.

40|$|Despite {{the huge}} {{sum of money}} that is being spent on {{research}} and development (R & D) on yearly basis by firms, very few empirical studies exist to shed more lights about the effects of this practice on firm performance. However, the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in their publication of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 38, require that expenditures incurred during R & D should either be expensed in the statement of comprehensive income or capitalized as an intangible asset in the statement of financial position provided certain criteria are fulfilled (IASB, 2012, p. 1045). Therefore, the main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the impact of expensed R & D and/or capitalized R & D on firm performance METHOD: Data for the study was collected from the audited financial statements of firms listed at the London Stock Exchange as well as from the website of this stock market. Two sampling techniques were utilized in the study; namely stratified sampling and random sampling. Stratified sampling technique was used to stratify the companies into various industries while random sampling was used to randomly select firms that are engaged in R & D from each of these industries. The final sample consisting of 52 firms gave a total of 260 observations for a period of 5 years between December 31 st, 2007 to December 31 st, 2011. Expensed R & D and capitalized R & D were obtained by taking the averages of statement of comprehensive income R & D to Revenue and statement of financial position R & D to revenue respectively. Moreover, firm performance was measured using accounting-based indicators which were Return on Asset (ROA), Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), Dividend Yield (DY), Dividend Cover (DC), Earnings per Share (EPS), Price Earnings Ratio (PE) and <b>Capital</b> <b>Gearing</b> Ratio (CGR). RESULTS: The results of the study show that expensed R & D has a significant positive impact on DC, a significant negative impact on EPS, positively correlated with CGR with no significant impact and negatively correlated with ROA, ROCE, DY and PE but had no significant impact. As concerns capitalized R & D, the results reveal that capitalized R & D has a significant negative impact on ROA, ROCE and EPS, positively correlated with CGR but have no significant impact and negatively correlated with DY, DC and PE as well though no significant impact was found...|$|E
40|$|Modigliani and Miller's (1958) {{irrelevance}} theory {{established the}} foundations of capital structure theory. They showed that, in a capital market free of taxes, transaction costs, asymmetric information, and other frictions, {{the value of the}} firm is independent of its capital structure choice. Most of the capital structure theory development that followed tested the irrelevance theory with more realistic assumptions regarding market frictions and information asymmetries. The vast amount of empirical research into the extent and effects of bankruptcy costs and taxes on capital structure, as well as cross-industry and cross-country examination of observed capital structure, led to the mainstream view that firms act as if there is a unique, optimal capital structure that results from the tradeoff between tax and agency cost benefits of increased debt use and the increased bankruptcy and agency costs that higher levels of debt entail. As an alternative to the trade-off model, Myers (1977) put forward the Pecking Order hypothesis of <b>capital</b> <b>gearing.</b> This states that because of information asymmetry and different stock market reactions to debt and equity issues, firms follow a "pecking order" in their financing decisions, i. e. they would first prefer to use internal funds rather than issuing securities. If forced to resort to external financing they would use debt before equity. Section one of this study undertakes a comprehensive review of the theoretical literature on capital structure to date, emphasising those theories that are more pertinent to the empirical study carried out in section two. Another school of thought which tries to explain the use of debt is transaction cost economics (Williamson, 1975, 1996), which sees debt and equity as two governance mechanisms, the choice between which is strongly dependent on asset specificity. Empirical tests are carried out in this study using regression analysis to try to establish whether the capital structure of firms in the UK hotel and retail industries is better explained by a pecking order model or by a target adjustment model. The last chapter presents an empirical analysis of different variables that are likely to influence the observed capital structure patterns. This panel data analysis assesses the role of size, earnings volatility, profitability, asset structure, non-debt tax shields, leasing and management contract (this latter is specific to the hotel industry) variables on gearing ratios. The conclusions of the empirical study are that the industry data analysed are much better explained by the target adjustment model than the pecking order model. However, a number of independent variables appear to contribute to the "target adjustment effect" and the debt tax shield is just one of them...|$|E

In particular the property industry companies were identified as a high profile sector as it is more sensitively exposed to environmental activities. The degree of reporting on environmental matters by this category of listed companies {{is indicative of the}} trend of the overall compliance and perception of reporting level on the environmental reporting. A rating score card system was utilised to evaluate the extent of the environmental disclosures from the comprehensive information disclosed in the Corporate Annual Report announced and filed in the fiscal year 2007 by the 100 companies of the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index listed companies. The interpretation of the studied data and the scores point was further evaluated to identify if the ‘high profile’ property industries had a higher level of environmental financial disclosure as what would normally be associated with a more environmentally impacted industry. The finding suggested that for the Property Industry, there was lower than expected disclosure conformities and correlation between compliancy and operating revenue, number of employee, market <b>capital,</b> <b>gearing</b> and Total Asset. It should be noted that only source of data used was that of the Corporate AnnualReports and that no other references to public statement made from the Company itself or published articles, materials from external parties (Government Authorities, non-governmental organization, NGO, and such) were made use of during the analysis of this study. Although any accompanying documents with the issuance of Annual Report was used for the evaluation purpose,for instance the “Sustainability Report” by the YTL Corporation Berhad to enable it’s stakeholders to be able to assess on better quantified sustainability reports on the group’s activity.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the influence of capital structure changes by target firms on the outcome and ex post performance of firms targeted by proxy contests. Design/methodology/approach – The influence is examined by using predictions of control-driven model developed by Harris and Raviv and signaling theory of debt in capital structure.

Significant differences are found between two groups of target firms – management victory targets and dissident victory targets. Specifically: management victory targets feature proxy contests that are accompanied by leverage increasing changes in target firms' capital structure; the same group also realizes better long-run stock performance compared to dissident victory targets; and the long-run abnormal stock performance of management victory targets is significantly positively related to the increases in leverage in the capital structure during proxy contest period.

This brought annual foreign earnings of 16 million guilders. After 1780, other than one might expect in view of the crises following that year, this trend sharply increased. This can only be explained by wholesale disinvestment in the Dutch economy, and reinvestment in especially foreign sovereign debt. Foreign investment probably doubled to 20 million guilders annually. The result was that Dutch residents held foreign debt instruments exceeding an estimated value of a billion guilders in 1795 (though other estimates are more conservative, the lower ones are still in the 650 million range).|$|R
40|$|I. This study {{examines}} the value to financial analysts and investors generally in the UK of firms' accounting disclosures {{and other information}} contained in the annual report and accounts for share valuation purposes. 2. Using daily share price data and a large sample of actively traded UK firms the relative information content of four major information releases, the preliminary announcement, annual report and accounts, annual general meeting and the interim report, are examined. Three different models are employed, two of which involved the calculation of the market risk measure; the firm's beta. To increase comparability with previous studies, some of the tests were replicated using weekly data. 3. Previous studies have shown a bias when calculating abnormal returns due to the size composition of the sample. Re-estimating the parameters using Ordinary Least Squares but including a size variable, showed virtually {{no effect on the}} magnitude of the estimated parameters. Neither the constant `alpha' nor the coefficient 11 of the size variable were statistically significant. The former is consistent with prior research. 4. Infrequency of trading is largely associated with small companies and gives rise to a downward bias when estimating betas. Although the sample comprised actively traded mainly large companies, the betas were re-estimated using a method which takes into account thin trading. The results indicated that parameter estimates have to take into consideration thin trading even when using predominantly large actively traded stocks. The degree of stability in the betas over successive periods was low though the difference in the average betas of the two periods was negligible. The pooled betas were therefore used. 5. The initial test was to ascertain the extent of the information content of the four events. The three different model formulations employed produced almost identical results suggesting a naive model with beta= 1 may well be adequate in many such event study situations. Therefore, all further tests were conducted using only the market model with adjusted betas. Of the four events, the preliminary announcement and interim report, largely representing earnings and dividends announcements, had the highest information content, whilst little information in aggregate is conveyed to the market by the annual general meeting and the annual report and accounts. Similar results were produced using a different information measure and weekly data. No unusual share price activity was observed prior to 111 the event day or after event day plus one, which is consistent with the semi-strong form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. 6. Evidence was found in tests of the market's reaction to `good' and `bad' news that, on average, they are given equal value except for the interim report where there is a sharper reaction to `bad' news. 7. This study supports previous research showing an inverse relationship between company size and the abnormal return on an event day. When variance of returns is included in the regression, the size coefficient albeit statistically significant becomes negligible in magnitude which suggests, like prior work, that size is probable a surrogate for absent firm specific variables. 8. Using a control group of companies with low annual report and accounts abnormal returns but otherwise matching a sample of outlier companies with high annual report and accounts residuals, an analysis was made of both groups. Little difference was noted in the amount of statutory or voluntary information disclosed in the preliminary announcements of the groups. There was, however, significant evidence of greater price-sensitive information being provided in the annual reports and accounts of the outlier group. 9. There was little evidence to suggest that one group was more closely followed by analysts than the other. <b>Capital</b> <b>gearing</b> and income cover were, on average, little different. Apparently what was driving the returns of the outlier sample was company specific information. The information seemed to be largely contained in two sections of the annual report, the balance sheet and the chairman's statement, which previous studies have shown to be valued by users. 10. Tests of association between information content of the events produced conflicting results but analysis of the press comments seemed to furnish some evidence of an informational relationship between the preliminary announcement and the annual report and accounts of the outlier group not observed in the control group. Press comments on the annual reports of the outlier group bear some relationship to the press comments on their preliminary announcements. 11. No previous study has directly examined the informational value of the annual report and accounts for individual firms and used analysis of press comments to identify those parts of the annual report which seem to have information content. The value of this study lies in the new evidence that it provides suggesting the annual report and accounts does have some information value for the stockmarket for particular firms and in identifying those parts of the annual report found useful by investors. 12. The implications of this study are that whilst, in aggregate, {{there seems to be an}} apparent lack of incremental information in the annual report and accounts,this is not a true reflection of its value to all market participants. Unless the stockmarket has access to this financial statement potential adverse valuation consequences may be missed.

The first stage included a detailed description and discussion of the nature and role of small business in the UK economy, heir relevance, problems and Government involvement in this sector, together with literature review and assessment of past research relevant to this study. The second stage was involved with construction of the models using multiple discriminant analysis, applied to published accountancy data for two groups of failed and nonfailed companies. The later stage was performed in three parts : (1) evaluating five discriminant models for each of five years prior to failure; (2) testing the performance of each of the. five models over time on data not used. in their construction; (3) testing the discriminant models on a validation sample. The purpose was to establish the "best" discriminant model. "Best" was determined according to classification ability of the model and interpretation of variables. Finally a model comprising seven financial ratios measuring four aspects of a company's financial profile, such as profitability, <b>gearing,</b> <b>capital</b> turnover and liquidity was chosen. The model has shown to be a valid tool for predicting companies' health up to five years in advance. Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of the Iraqi Government...|$|R
40|$|This inquiry was {{established}} to assess issues related to home ownership in Australia, and potential policy responses by government. A range of views on the challenges facing home buyers today were canvassed throughout this inquiry. The core {{issues related to the}} housing market inevitably centre on supply and demand – these factors drive property prices around the nation. Demand for housing is strong in Sydney and Melbourne but it must be noted {{this is not the case}} throughout Australia. Many parts of Australia have a relatively weak housing market. It is important that government policy in this area is cognisant of the significant variations in the domestic housing market. The committee’s view is that government policy in this area should predominantly focus on boosting dwelling supply in underserved markets. Many of the witnesses before the inquiry stated that a lack of supply was contributing to rising house prices in Sydney and Melbourne. In the committee’s view, state and territory governments need to do more to adequately address land supply and ensure that existing policies and processes are not unnecessarily causing an undersupply. The Federal Government is also focused on this key supply issue through the Smart Cities Plan announced this year, which will partner with the states and territories, and local governments to deliver coordinated housing supply solutions tailored to local needs. The committee welcomes this initiative. Tax arrangements for the buying and selling of property were key areas of discussion throughout the inquiry. This included negative <b>gearing,</b> <b>capital</b> gains tax on investment properties, stamp duty and land tax...|$|R
40|$|The chapter has {{reviewed}} selected Australian {{examples of}} individualised housing and social assistance. A {{number of key}} issues were raised about the implementation of individualised housing and social support programs. The issues raised are not dissimilar to the international experience outlined in Chapters 2 and 3. First, the examples highlight the need {{to ensure that there}} remains a balance between both demand and supply-side responses. Interviewees noted that the provision of therapeutic programs with individualised forms of assistance is not a substitute for long-term supply side interventions that address the shortage of accommodation. Both components are required to deliver positive outcomes for clients. In Australia, the Common Ground and Foyer models of homelessness intervention provide clients with access to transitional or permanent housing, as well as integrated client-directed service response. While the Indigenous home ownership scheme is a demand-side response, historically housing assistance for Indigenous Australians has been weighted towards supply-side responses (e. g. provision of Indigenous Community Housing). This is exhibited by Indigenous Australians being less likely to access financial subsidies for home ownership and housing investment (e. g. negative <b>gearing,</b> <b>capital</b> gains tax exemptions on main residence, and First Home Ownership Scheme). Second, while most managers embraced client-centred approaches to service design and delivery they raised concerns about passing the responsibility on to vulnerable clients to navigate, advocate and determine forms and degree of support. Service providers recognised that there is considerable variation in client capacity to engage with and to navigate complex systems of service delivery. Managers in the homelessness sector were critical about the notion of choice for vulnerable client groups such as ex-offenders, who continue to face discrimination from private landlords regardless of the development of th...|$|R

The main findings indicate that quarterly financial reports in the Kuwait Stock Exchange are useful to Kuwaiti investors; however, such reports need further refinement and closer regulation in order to increase their usefulness, especially in relation to companies' expected performance and the future expectations of companies. In addition, the study shows that QFRs increase investor confidence when making and subsequently monitoring investments, evaluating management performance, making predictions about the future performance of companies, and predicting the future values of dividends and share prices. The findings also revealed that respondents believed that the prices and volumes of shares traded on the KSE are sensitive to financial information contained in QFRs. Specifically, the results indicate that company earnings, dividends payments, annual reports, quarterly reports and management experience were the most influential factors affecting purchasing attitudes and share prices. With regard to QFRs the majority of respondentsb elieved that auditor involvement in QFRs improved their reliability; however, most of the users expressed dissatisfaction with the current reporting lag of 45 days and would ideally like to see this reduced to less than 30 days.

40|$|Since {{the past}} many years the marine fishery sector of Kerala {{has been and}} {{continues}} {{to be one of the}} major sources of fish. The trend shows that the consumption of fish is on a rise and there has been an unceasing increase of issues pertaining to food secunty in terms of spiraling of the fish prices as well as non-availability of fish. With the decrease in catch per unit effort of fish resources, there is a critical requisite to identify new fishery resources to sustain the fish food security of the country. The marine fishing sector has witnessed vast technological developments in both harvest and post-harvest fisheries during the last few decades. Deep-sea shrimp fishing operations in Kerala started in 1999 with its initial phase registering high landings, but dropped down considerably in the subsequent years. This study was carried out to analyze the economic evaluation of deep-sea shrimp fishery of Kerala. The study was conducted in Sakthikulangara (Kollam District), Vypin and Cochin Fisheries Harbours (Ernakulum District) along the Kerala coast during the period August 2010 - May 2011. The primary data on craft and <b>gear,</b> <b>capital</b> investment, fixed cost, operational cost, catch, species composition and revenue were collected from 90 deep-sea shrimp trawlers. The results indicated that the operational cost for deep-sea shrimp trawlers was very huge when compared to coastal trawlers. The average operational qsts for deep-sea shrimp trawlers targeted for Red ring was Rs. 209391 and the net operating income was Rs. 94163 per trip, whereas, in the case of other deep-sea shrimps the average operating costs and net operating income were Rs. 146737 and Rs. 55870, respectively. Of the total operational cost, expense incurred on fuel was the most significlirt factor contributing 55 percent followed by crew share (22 percent) and ice (7 percent). The study suggests that concerted efforts are required for the sustenance of the sector, which would indisputably contribute additional fish landings for the State and would ensure fish food security...|$|R
40|$|This monograph, {{which has}} been {{prepared}} as a Research Report to the New Zealand (New Zealand) Treasury, undertakes three main tasks: (1) describing {{the various forms of}} tangible and intangible human capital, their relationship to "capabilities" affecting human well-being, and the channels through which they may contribute to economic growth; (2) reviewing the major theoretical and empirical findings on the microeconomic determinants, and macroeconomic growth effects of investment in human capital; (3) reviewing salient general implications for policies affecting human capital, and indicating measures specifically germane to the situation of the New Zealand economy. For these purposes, the concept of human capital is defined comprehensively, so that it embraces capacities for interpreting flows of sensory data and structured information required for goal-directed individual actions and inter-personal transactions, and for providing various physical labour service- inputs in ordinary production processes. More conventionally, it subsumes the creative faculties for generating new scientific and technological knowledge, the cognitive basis of entrepreneurship, and the competences for managing market and non-market production as well as household consumption activities. The report is organised in three main Parts that address the three major objectives, taking each in its turn. A detailed Table of Contents and an Executive Summary precede the text, which is followed by extensive bibliographic references. A unifying conceptual framework is developed to (a) identify the micro-level processes involved in human capital formation; (b) implicitly aggregate the resulting qualities and capabilities of individuals belonging to successive population cohorts; (c) trace the interrelated influences that the forms of human capital have upon macroeconomic performance. The review of empirical evidence at the macroeconomic level features a discussion of the deficiencies of data and methods in many of the international cross-section studies, and contrasts recent econometric findings on the role of education in economic growth among the developed economies with the conclusions derived through more detailed analyses of their historical experiences. Significant policy implications do emerge from the modern macroeconomic growth literature, but these are very broad in nature and not particularly germane to the situation of small, open economies that may lack a substantial industrial base or the extensive human and institutional infrastructure required to generate the knowledge-base needed for their peoples' well-being and their firms' competitive success in international markets. Nor does the received literature adequately treat the implications of such economies' potential to rapidly alter their respective human resource endowments through differential population migration. Consideration of human <b>capital</b> policies <b>geared</b> more closely to the specific challenges and opportunities facing New Zealand's economy leads to the formulation of a number of novel proposals. These would reform tax treatment of education and training investments by residents and immigrants alike; subsidise new voluntary institutions developing on-the-job training programs under industry sponsorship; undertake public information infrastructure investments {{in order to reduce the}} costs of effective access to global knowledge bases in science and technology. Proposals also are considered for integrated government programmes to accelerate the closing of persistent socio-economic disparities within New Zealand society, such as those between Maori and non-Maori. human capital; capabilities; knowledge; education; on-the-job training; R&D; productivity; macroeconomic growth theory; investment taxation and subsidies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine market concentration, economies of scale, economies of scope, and the {{relative}} size of a particular fund, within a fund family, as determinants of mutual-fund expense ratio. This examination is focused at the asset-manager level and is based on the Morningstar equity and fixed-income style classifications. Design/methodology/approach – All data used in this study come from the July Morningstar Principia database for the years 1997 through 2006. One challenge of working with these data is that Morningstar treats each separate class of a fund as though it were an individual fund. As a result all Morningstar data items are reported for each fund class as though they are data items for a separate fund. The data are modified so that the items for separate classes of a fund are merged into data for a single fund. For example, assets in a fund become the total of the assets in each class of the fund. Findings – This study contributes to the literature on mutual-fund managers, and the literature on the structure of mutual funds, by showing that market concentration at the asset-manager level varies substantially across Morningstar styles, particularly for the fixed-income funds. The paper shows that increased market concentration is associated with greater expenses for the funds under management, within a given Morningstar-style box, for both equity funds and for fixed-income funds. We also show that increased costs are partially offset by economies of scope for the fixed-income funds. Originality/value – This paper extends the current literature in several ways. First, it confirms the existence of economies of scale at the fund level within Morningstar style classifications. Second, it documents the existence of varying levels of market concentration within different Morningstar style classifications. Third, the results demonstrate that there is a negative relation between the scope of funds handled across the Morningstar classifications by a particular fund manager and the expense ratio for particular funds. Finally, the results presented in this paper show that the largest funds within a family are associated with the highest expense ratios in the family. <b>Capital</b> structure, Debts, <b>Gearing,</b> Stock returns, Take-overs...|$|R
40|$|LL. D. Banks are {{important}} institutional mechanisms in {{local and international}} markets. In general a bank is required to fulfil the important function, inter a/ia, of collecting the general public's savings and channelling it into productive investments in the economy. As {{part of this process}} a bank subjects mainly depositors' funds to various types of risk in an endeavour to generate profits. It results in the level of risk exposure assumed by the bank normally being much higher than the actual level of the bank's <b>capital.</b> This <b>gearing</b> effect may unfortunately act as an incentive for directors and management ("management") of a bank to subject depositors' funds to outrageous risks in a quest to earn extraordinary profits. Under such circumstances the chances of gain may be unreasonably small in comparison with the high probability of loss of the depositors' funds and the (possible) failure of the bank. In addition, the danger exists that the failure of a bank may cause the demise of other banks or may even result in the failure of whole financial systems. Therefore, in view of the worldwide expansion of banks, the Bank for International Settlements (together with other international bodies) is involved in developing and maintaining uniform international minimum standards of supervision on a global scale. Regulators worldwide are required to adhere to these standards if the banks in their jurisdictions are to participate in the international financial markets. In South Africa, the Banks Act, 1990 (Act No. 94 of 1990), provides for the regulation and supervision of banks, which banks (other than branches of foreign banks and mutual banks) are required to be public companies. This company structure offers persons who are equipped with special managerial abilities and skills the opportunity to manage and control the company's business. Accordingly, the worldwide phenomenon of the separation between the shareholders and management of the company (concomitant with virtually unlimited managerial freedom) extant in large public companies exacerbates the risk of the loss of deposits occasioned by negligence or misdemeanour on the part of management of banks. Moreover, market forces and principles of South Africa's statutory and common law pertaining to the duties of management fail to provide the necessary system of countermeasures to guard against the exploitation by management of the business of a bank and {{to reduce the risk of}} loss to depositors. Consequently, considerations of public interest dictate that the principles of a free-market economy be supplanted by legislation that introduces prescriptive rules with regard to the regulation and governance of the management of banks. The purpose of such legislation should be to rectify market failures and to protect the interests of depositors. It must also provide the Registrar of Banks with an adequate structure to oversee compliance with international minimum standards of regulation and governance pertaining to the management of banks. In this vein, the study undertaken in this thesis has resulted in draft pro forma legislation aimed at addressing the designated needs and standards. Should legislation of this nature be introduced and applied to the management of banks in South Africa, it would not only ensure compliance with internationally recognised regulatory and governance standards, but should also protect the interests of depositors. The proposed legislation ought to minimise the risk of the loss of deposits and should contribute towards maintaining/restoring the confidence of the general public in the financial system of South Africa. It would also enhance the process of ensuring that only fit and proper persons are appointed as managers, and continue to manage a bank and/or bank controlling company. The pro forma legislation is designed to be enacted as amendments to the current provisions of the Banks Act...|$|R
