5|$|In 1789, Sally and James Hemings {{returned}} to the United States with Jefferson. He was 46 years old and seven years a widower. As shown by Jefferson's father-in-law, John Wayles, wealthy Virginia widowers frequently raped enslaved women. Historian Joshua D. Rothman noted {{it was not unusual}} for the time for Jefferson to <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. White society simply expected these men to be discreet.|$|E
5|$|Voluntary markets, also {{referred}} to as green power markets, are driven by consumer preference. Voluntary markets allow a consumer to <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more than policy decisions require and reduce the environmental impact of their electricity use. Voluntary green power products must offer a significant benefit and value to buyers to be successful. Benefits may include zero or reduced greenhouse gas emissions, other pollution reductions or other environmental improvements on power stations.|$|E
5|$|Life on Brook Farm {{was based}} on {{balancing}} labor and leisure while working together {{for the benefit of}} the greater community. Each member could <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whatever work they found most appealing and all were paid equally, including women. Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing as well as through fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm. The main source of income was the school, which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley. A pre-school, primary school, and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education. Adult education was also offered.|$|E

5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic testing {{can be used to}} confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or embryo carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the implications of a confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
25|$|Four {{years of}} English are {{required}} to graduate, {{as well as two}} years of math (although most students <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> four), and completion of two years of Laboratory Science (again, most students <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more). In addition, all students must take one year of an art class, one year of foreign language, one semester of any computer class, and one semester of social psychology (required sophomore year). Freshmen {{are required to}} take physical education unless they are nationally ranked in a sport. Sophomore and junior year, only one semester each year is required, which can be replaced by one season of a school sport (V or JV).|$|E
25|$|If the wicket-keeper fumbles or {{misses the}} ball, the batsmen {{may be able}} to take {{additional}} runs safely, and may <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The number of runs scored are scored as wides, not byes. These extra wides are all added to the bowler's record.|$|E

25|$|Under federal law, any of {{the states}} or territories in the United States may {{maintain}} a state defense force, and nearly half of them <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.

25|$|Another {{example and}} {{specificity}} of ESSEC {{is that it}} offers its {{students the opportunity to}} do an apprenticeship within a company, which will cover 100% of the tuition fees. Around 30% of students will <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a 2-year apprenticeship within a company (2 x 6 months spent in the company and the other half at school, 4 x 3 months or on a weekly basis, depending on how they decided to structure their curriculum).|$|E

25|$|In the Mahayana world view, {{there are}} also pure lands which lie outside this {{continuum}} and are created by the Buddhas upon attaining enlightenment.

25|$|A dive boat {{will not}} be {{carrying}} a decompression chamber to treat a diver with decompression illness - that would normally classify it as a diving support vessel, so treatment {{would be limited to}} oxygen therapy with 100% oxygen, first aid emergency life support and transportation to the nearest suitable medical facility, or for operations where the equipment is available, and the risk is assessed as acceptable, technical or scientific divers may <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in-water recompression.|$|E
25|$|Members' agents {{co-ordinate}} the members' underwriting {{and act as}} {{a buffer}} between Lloyd's, the managing agents and the members. They were introduced in the mid-1970s and grew in number until many went bust; many of the businesses merged, and there are now only four left (Argenta, Hampden, Alpha and LMAS, which has no active Names). It is mandatory that unlimited Names write through a members' agent, and many limited liability members also <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

25|$|Mexican {{citizens}} {{who have chosen}} to be career soldiers are signed for an initial 3-year contract and, {{at the end of}} it, are encouraged to sign for another 2-year contract.

(Escuela Militar de Classes de las Armas).|$|E
25|$|Still, as the U.S. economy {{begins to}} recover, America {{might still be}} too skeptical to {{increase}} imports from Mexico right away. With American consumers spending less money, it may be likely {{that the government will}} <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same. The United States may disregard the struggling state of Mexico in order to fulfill its own self-interest which will further devastate Mexico. It is this type of influential relationship that implies that U.S. imperialism has yet to cease along the southern border.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from his}} mother, Al Saher's family were never {{supportive}} of his direction {{in becoming a}} musician. They had no faith in {{him that he would}} become successful, and instead wanted him to become a doctor or a lawyer. Saher's brother once took him to different places where people usually sang, and told him it's your choice to sing a respectful way or you can <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it the bad way. He said {{that the only way to}} achieve success is if you respect your music and respect yourself.|$|E
25|$|Doctors {{wishing to}} pursue a {{speciality}} must take entrance exams at the public/private institution of their choice that offers them. It is easier for students in private Medical Schools to obtain a residency in a Private Hospital, especially when the university has its own hospital, as the university holds positions specifically for its graduates. Speciality courses last about two to five years, depending on the branch of medicine the physician has chosen. There is no legal limit {{for the number of}} specialities a doctor can learn, although most doctors <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> one and then they sub-specialise for further job opportunities and less overall competition, along with higher wages.|$|E
25|$|At {{the local}} level, there are 6,473 Episcopal congregations, {{each of which}} elects a vestry or bishop's committee. Subject to the {{approval}} of its diocesan bishop, the vestry of each parish elects a priest, called the rector, who has spiritual jurisdiction in the parish and selects assistant clergy, both deacons and priests. (There {{is a difference between}} vestry and clergy elections – clergy are ordained members usually selected from outside the parish, whereas any member in good standing of a parish is eligible to serve on the vestry.) The diocesan bishop, however, appoints the clergy for all missions and may <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so for non-self-supporting parishes.|$|E
