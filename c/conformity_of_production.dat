Using standard structural reliability methods, the filter effect can be translated into an effect on the safety level of structural concrete elements.

40|$|The {{assurance}} {{given to}} consumers {{in a healthy}} diet {{is an important factor}} in establishing the quality of life. Food quality depends on how it is produced, and the lack of criteria and safety control are problems that cause as consequence, the presence of chemical residues in food, contamination of soil and water needed for food <b>production.</b> The movement <b>of</b> organic agriculture concerned with the quality of food and the environment has built organic production standards initiated by IFOAM over the years and also has originated the companies that provide certification through auditing by assessing the <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> organic <b>production.</b> In Brazil, alternative agriculture movement began in the 1970 s with the actions <b>of</b> sustainable food <b>production,</b> and from the 1990 s, both auditing and certification companies as well as concomitant movements of groups of producers, consumers, distributors and traders, NGOs and technicians through participatory certification standards established conformity assessment for the management of organic products quality. Organic agriculture has been regulated from the federal law 10. 831 / 2003, and participatory certification initiatives are called Participatory Guarantee Systems - PGS and authorizes the management of organic quality in Brazil. This paper aims to present the management of organic agriculture iniciatives in the State of São Paulo and trends of compliance with legislation of the entities that operate in this area and intend to take on PGS and create an PGA - Participatory Guarantee Agency, according to Normative Instruction 19 / 2009 which deals with mechanisms <b>of</b> Organic <b>Conformity</b> Assessment...|$|R

40|$|To meet 2010 {{emission}} targets, optimal SCR systemperformance is required. In addition, {{attention has}} to bepaid to in-use compliance requirements. Closed-loopcontrol seems an attractive option {{to meet the}} formulatedgoals. This study deals with the potential and limitationsof closed-loop SCR control. High NOx conversion in combination with acceptable NH 3 slip can be realized with an open-loop control strategy. However, closed-loop control is needed to make theSCR system robust for urea dosage inaccuracy, catalystageing and NOx engine-out variations. Then, the systemmeets <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and in-use compliancenorms. To demonstrate the potential of closed-loop SCR control,a NOx sensor based control strategy with cross-sensitivity compensation is compared with an adaptivesurface coverage/NH 3 slip control strategy and an open-loop strategy. The adaptive surface coverage/NH 3 slipcontrol strategy shows best performance over simulatedESC and ETC cycles. SCR catalyst dynamics, time delay in the urea injectionand maximum NH 3 slip targets limit the performance ofclosed-loop SCR control. If new reagent dosage systemsand future catalyst technology are able to relieve theselimitations, closed-loop control has the potential toreduce the calibration effort and to improve the transientcontrol performance...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Sound of {{motorcycles}} {{plays an}} important role in noise pollution in big cities. This is due to the lack of national law or standards to control the noise of domestic and also imported motorcycles. This study tries to introduce a practical limit value in different stage of motorcycle life cycle by assessing their noise pollution. Materials and Methods: First the motorcycles noise standards at different countries were studied and they were compared with the results from noise level of 622 motorcycles in 3 different groups. The sample volume in each group corresponds to the amount of their annual production rate. Then using statistical tests, a limit was determined in which 90 % of the domestic motorcycles can be covered. The limit is proposed as the standard for domestic motorcycle noise. Results: The limit for motorcycles of groups 1, 2 and 3 were 84, 86 and 87 dB (A),respectively in the TA stage. For the COP stage (<b>Conformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Production),</b> the limit increases according to certain formula. In the end, a flowchart was proposed as a standard method for measuring the sound of motorcycles in the TA and COP stages was proposed. Conclusion: Noise level of the domestic motorcycles is at least 9 dB (A) higher than the noise limit value of European motorcycle. If European limit value is considered for producing the national motorcycle, 90 % of them will get out of production cycle and this would not be practical...|$|E
40|$|Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is the {{dominant}} solution for meeting future NOx reduction regulations for heavy-duty diesel powertrains. SCR systems benefit from closed-loop control if an appropriate exhaust gas sensor were available. An ammonia sensor has recently been developed {{for use as a}} feedback element in closed-loop control of urea dosing in a diesel SCR aftertreatment system. Closed-loop control of SCR dosing enables the SCR system to be robust against disturbances and to meet <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> (COP) and in-use compliance norms. The ammonia sensor is based on a non-equilibrium electrochemical principle and outputs emf signals. The sensor performs well when tested in a diesel engine exhaust environment and has minimum cross interference with CO, HC, NO, NO 2, SO 2, H 2 O and O 2. Previous work, done in a simulation environment, demonstrated that an ammonia sensor provides the optimal feedback for urea dosing control algorithms in closed-loop SCR systems. A model-based SCR control strategy deploying an ammonia feedback sensor demonstrated high NOx conversion, low NH 3 slip and good robustness against disturbances. In this paper, FTP, ETC and ESC test data will be presented confirming these results. NOx conversions as high as 91 % are measured in combination with 30 % urea injection error and a 25 ppm NH 3 slip constraint. Test results using the Delphi ammonia sensor for control are compared with test results utilizing a commercially available NOx sensor for control...|$|E

40|$|Quality plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry. A major challenge is to validate the <b>conformity</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> processes with regulatory requirements. The ICH Q 9 guideline for Quality Risk Management defined by regulatory authorities of the European Union, Japan and the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a continuous update of the risk documentation to reflect the current manufacturing process for a pharmaceutical product. This paper introduces a sustainable and modular approach for “Failure Modes and Effects Analysis” (FMEA) of manufacturing processes in the pharmaceutical industry. The modular design builds upon an expandable and adaptable core structure defined by matrices. The matrix approach covers three steps considering each product characteristic and process parameter in the entire production process. The first step is to identify the product characteristics in each process step and to analyze how they relate to other product characteristics in successive process steps including the quality characteristics of the final product. Secondly, the specific product characteristics are correlated with the defined test and detection actions. Considering the requirements of the ICH-Endorsed Guide for ICH Q 8 /Q 9 /Q 10 Implementation, the linkage between Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs) and Critical Process Parameters (CPPs) has to be pointed out in the risk documentation. Therefore, step three links the process parameters provided by the particular process step with the control and disturbance variables. This makes it possible to outline the interdependencies between each process step parameter (CPPs) and the entire set of process attributes (CQAs) in a single structured Process FMEA. In case that process steps in an existing process get adapted or replaced, the dependence of the new or changed process steps can be derived from the matrices. This eliminates the necessity to create a completely new Process FMEA. All process steps can thus be substituted at minimum effort. In conclusion, this enables the user to substitute sub-process steps without ignoring the holistic view of the methodological approach of a Process FMEA...|$|E
