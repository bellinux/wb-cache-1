50|$|Multilevel {{modeling}} {{with repeated}} measures employs the same statistical techniques as MLM with clustered data. In multilevel modeling for repeated measures data, the measurement occasions are nested within cases (e.g. individual or subject). Thus, level-1 units consist of the repeated measures for each subject, and the level-2 unit {{is the individual}} or subject. In addition to estimating overall parameter estimates, MLM allows regression equations {{at the level of}} the individual. Thus, as a growth <b>curve</b> <b>modeling</b> technique, it allows the estimation of inter-individual differences in intra-individual change over time by modeling the variances and covariances. In other words, it allows the testing of individual differences in patterns of responses over time (i.e. growth curves).

Although the probability distribution functions (pdfs) of the wind speed are commonly used, their seemingly good performance for distribution may not always translate into an accurate assessment of power generation.

Consequently, growth <b>curve</b> <b>models</b> and other forecasting methods should be used together to provide a triangulated forecast. Furthermore, the growth curve methodology offers a simple tool for resource management to determine what might happen to future production if resource availability poses a problem.
