5000|$|United Flight 93 was {{scheduled}} to depart at 8:00am, but the Boeing 757 did not depart until 42 minutes later due to runway traffic delays. Four minutes later, American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center's North Tower. Fifteen minutes later, at 9:03 am, as United Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower, United 93 was climbing to cruising altitude, heading west over New Jersey and into Pennsylvania. At 9:25 am, Flight 93 was above eastern Ohio, and pilots Jason Dahl and LeRoy Homer received an alert, [...] "beware of cockpit intrusion," [...] on the cockpit computer device ACARS (Aircraft <b>Communications</b> <b>and</b> <b>Reporting</b> System). Three minutes later, Cleveland controllers could hear screams over the cockpit's open microphone. Moments later, the hijackers, led by the Lebanese Ziad Samir Jarrah, took over the plane's controls, disengaged the autopilot, and told passengers, [...] "Keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on board". Bingham and the other passengers were herded {{into the back of}} the plane. The curtain between first class and second class had been drawn, at which point the pilot and co-pilot were seen lying dead on the floor just outside the curtain, their throats having been cut. Within six minutes, the plane changed course and was heading for Washington, D.C. Several of the passengers made phone calls to loved ones, who informed them about the two planes that had crashed into the World Trade Center. Bingham phoned his mother, reporting that his plane had been hijacked and relaying his love for her. According to Hoglan, Bingham said: [...] "Hi mom, I love you very much, I'm calling you from the plane. We've been taking over. There are three men that say that they have a bomb." ...|$|E

40|$|Emergency Management is {{essential}} to provide services to those in need during an emergency situation. In Northwest Indiana, the Emergency Management Agency (EMA) is developing a Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) for District 1, which is Northwest Indiana. District 1 in the State of Indiana includes the counties: Lake, Porter, Newton, LaPorte, and Jasper (Indiana Homeland Security District 1, 2013). The CEMP consists of Emergency Support Functions (ESFs). The main focus of this thesis is to complete Task # 1 under Response Tasks, “Activate SOPs or guidelines for emergency operations that consider: The assessment, staging, use, status, and sustainability of facilities, equipment, supplies, and other resources. The assessment and status of roadways, bridges, and other critical infrastructure. The alert, notification and activation of personnel for {{work in the field}} or within the MACC. Emergency <b>communications</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> procedures” (Indiana Homeland Security District 1, 2013). MACC represents Multiagency Coordination Center. This task is under the Emergency Support Function # 1 : Transportation. ^ In order to answer this task, {{the first step is to}} conduct a theoretical framework for decision making for the EMA in Northwest Indiana. This framework will allow the EMA and its emergency responders to follow certain steps depending on the type, location, and even the possible effects of the disaster. Also, to answer Task # 1, traffic simulation models were created using PTV Vision Vissim® to compare everyday traffic to traffic during any type of disaster, whether it is a snow storm, or a mass flood, which is where the engineering applies to this thesis. Vissim is a traffic simulation program that offers the users to simulate traffic patterns exactly how they are in the real world (PTV Group). Using these real world traffic simulation models, everyday traffic can be compared to scenarios with different natural disasters to see how the traffic is affected. By considering two scenarios involving a flooding situation and severe snow conditions, simulations were made and compared with regular patterns to study the effectiveness of emergency planning in Northwest Indiana. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{track and}} detect {{continuous}} natured objects in wireless sensor networks, {{large number of}} sensor nodes are involved. These continuous objects like bio-chemical diffusions, forest fires, oil spills usually spread over larger area. Phenomena sensing nodes need {{to communicate with each}} other for information exchange and also send sensing information to sink, possibly by passing through many intermediate nodes. The process consumes a lot of communication overhead and waste of sensors scarce energy. In this paper, we proposed an optimized approach to reduce number of <b>communications</b> <b>and</b> <b>report</b> data size to the sink. Sensors locally broadcast their sensing status to one-hop neighbors, and suppress any transmission that contains any trivial data. Intermediate nodes further suppress the report data by applying data aggregation and filtering.
