50|$|The {{adoption}} {{of genetically modified}} (GMOs) cropping {{by the government of}} Western Australia in 2010 and the subsequent failure of <b>crop</b> <b>segregation</b> has led to the contamination of at least one organic farm by Monsanto's GM canola. The organic certification of the certified organic farm of Steve and Sue Marsh was withdrawn in 2010 due to GM contamination. A court case in the Supreme Court of Western Australia for nuisance and negligence failed to achieve any relief or protection for the organic farm. However, the organic certification of the Marsh farm was reinstated in 2013.|$|E
40|$|Biotechnology is {{offering}} farmers new crop production opportunities and challenges. Prior to selecting a transgenic variety, farmers {{must consider the}} cost of the technology fee, possible yield drag, potential pest infestations, possible reductions in pesticide costs, refuge requirements to minimize the development of insect resistance, and adjustments in cultural practices. Moreover, <b>crop</b> <b>segregation</b> in the field, storage, and shipment may be necessary to capture potential price premiums for nontransgenic varieties. As farmers consider these various production and marketing factors, they find that Bt corn is a more profitable control method for European corn borer in the Western Corn Belt relative to the Eastern Corn Belt. This is primarily due to higher infestation probabilities in the Western Corn Belt, coupled with greater demand for manufacturing and export uses in the Eastern Corn Belt where several buyers do not accept transgenic corn...|$|E
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) wheat {{is expected}} to receive regulatory approval in Canada between 2003 and 2005. There may be a definitive portion of the supply chain for wheat set to realize {{the potential benefits of}} GM wheat. However, by September 2000, 18 countries and the EU, 21 food retailers, 29 food manufacturers and six restaurant chains around the world had announced intentions to introduce either mandatory or voluntary labelling requirements for genetically modified foods. Thus, to allow genetically modified varieties of crops to be grown in Canada, while maintaining access to export markets requesting labelling, <b>crop</b> <b>segregation</b> or identity preservation systems must be introduced. The primary objective {{of the study was to}} compare the private and regional costs of three potential segregation alternatives, all of which utilize the bulk commodity infrastructure already established in western Canada to handle the segregation of non-GM wheat. The systems that were examined included the designation of a high throughput terminal, the designation of multiple small wooden elevators and lastly, the segregation of GM and non-GM wheat within terminals. The three options were analyzed under various GM adoption rates and volumes of non-GM wheat being demanded under the assumption that the low-cost option would be dependant on the availability of non-GM wheat in the region, as well as the amount of product requiring segregation. A model was used that attempted to simulate the decision-making processes of producers in the region as well as methods used by the companies handling the segregation in their attempts to source the required amount of non-GM grain. The results of the model indicated that segregation within terminals was almost always the low-cost option. However, an analysis of the potential risk of contamination indicated that this option was most likely the least feasible option. An analysis of the remaining two options indicated that the low-cost option for the entire region would be to designate a high throughput terminal under any circumstances. The results of the study illustrate the importance of contamination risk when determining the low-cost segregation strategy. The results also illustrate that failing to include regional costs, including lost rail incentives and the inefficiencies of small elevators may lead to sub-optimal strategies.

40|$|In this paper, {{we use a}} {{simulation}} model to measure the potential market and welfare effects of recently introduced genetically modified (GM) canola in Australia. The short-run results indicate that non-GM canola may emerge as a niche product commanding a premium. In the long run, GM technology appears to enhance aggregate welfare. However, when production cost savings are trivial and consumers become highly concerned about GM food products, aggregate welfare may decline. The policy implications of the analysis are explored. canola market, genetically modified <b>crops,</b> <b>segregation,</b> welfare.,...|$|R

40|$|Development {{of genetically}} {{modified}} (GM) and specialty crops has had {{a great impact on}} the grain handling industry during recent years. Added costs associated with handling these crops have become an important issue for grain handlers. For this study, data were collected from a survey of elevators in the Upper Midwest. The information focused on segregation practices, time requirements, and costs. This study shows the different costs (grading and handling) associated with segregation practices at the grain-handler level. The results revealed that the cost of modifying systems to handle GM is of major importance. A stochastic simulation model of an engineering cost function is developed to analyze costs for segregation and testing using results from the survey. Assuming no modification is required, the total cost of segregation is about 10 cents per bushel. The volume of grain tested also impacts the total segregation cost per bushel. Finally, the gross elevator margin and the premium for quality seem to be large enough to offset the increase in handling costs due to these new segregation practices.

Analytical solutions are not available when segregation is the optimal strategy, and so solutions are obtained with nonlinear optimization.

40|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) grains {{have increased}} in importance. Moving biotech grains from producers to processors is a challenge for the grain handling system that could involve increased segregations. The objective {{of this research is}} to determine how testing strategies affect the logistical costs of a grain pipeline when GM wheat is present. A logistical model was developed and simulated to analyze impacts of uncertainty in demand, receipts, test accuracy, rail deliveries, and transit time. Sensitivities were conducted on certain variables to determine their effects on logistical costs. Analysis revealed that logistical costs are impacted by the number of quality categories and uncertainties in the system. Adding GM grains increased costs due to testing requirements and increased segregation demands as the number of wheat categories rises.

40|$|Commercial {{vegetative}} propagation of floricultural <b>crops</b> requires the <b>segregation</b> of plant cuttings into categories based on size. The cuttings however must be graded {{when they are}} planted ("stuck"), at which time the grade of a cutting {{is not easy to}} determine. This paper reports on a system that learns to classify cuttings from being shown examples of images of cuttings that have been graded by a human expert. Based on the example set, the system learns to grade cuttings into categories. We report the results based on a set of 150 geranium plants that were graded by our system and compare the results to the performance of an expert grader.

40|$|Special segregations {{that provide}} unique qualities {{for end use}} {{products}} are being specified by buyers. As users of wheat become more specific about quality, the number of quality segregations that the logistical pipeline must accommodate increases. The additional cost of increased grain segregations will influence the optimal level of wheat variety segregations marketed in a supply chain. The primary objective {{of this research is}} to develop a model that captures the logistical costs of increased grain segregations in the marketing system. A simulation model was developed to add logistical uncertainty in demand, receipts, rail deliveries, and transit time. Sensitivities were conducted on certain variables to determine their effects on logistical costs. Logistical costs increase as more segregations are added. In addition, increasing uncertainty into the system raises logistical costs. Pipeline configuration also affects costs as the number of categories/storage bins present at origin may differ from the wheat categories demanded or the number of storage bins present at the export elevator. wheat, <b>segregations,</b> <b>Crop</b> Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|The genetic {{modification}} of crop plants from the methodology {{involved in their}} production through to the current debate on their use in agriculture are reviewed. Techniques for plant transformation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens and particle bombardment, and for the selection of transgenic plants using marker genes are described.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} site-specific {{and uniform}} management options for wheat production {{with respect to}} grain quality. Besides site-specific fertilization the economic potential of segregation of different grain qualities {{is the subject of}} this paper. Yield and quality response to fertilizer were taken from field experiments in Germany to calculate site-specific response functions. The economic optima were calculated for uniform management (UM), complete separate management of the subfields (SM), site-specific fertilization (SSF) and grain segregation (GS) for different price structures according to different grain qualities. The results show that over all price structures, highest economic potential was found with SM or SSF compared to UM. However, these management practices require the possibility to separately manage subfields (SM) or specific fertilization equipment and fertilizer algorithms (SSM). GS did not have a higher economic potential than UM. However, if required grain qualities are not met for the whole field, GS can substantially reduce profit losses by separating part of the grains and selling them at higher prices. This may save the farmer more than 50 € ha– 1. In situations where higher grain qualities could only be obtained at the expense of yield penalties, premiums for higher grain qualities can create incentives for fertilizer rates beyond the yield maximizing rate. GS technologies may even boost this effect. site-specific nitrogen management, wheat quality, grain <b>segregation.,</b> <b>Crop</b> Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) crops in the mid 1990 s {{appeared to be the}} latest in a string of technological innovations in agriculture. However, consumer resistance, particularly in Europe has limited the sector’s enthusiasm. One response to the limited enthusiasm has been the emergence of segregated markets for GM and non-GM products. These separated markets reduce economic welfare because they require additional costs in the marketing system. Offsetting these segregation costs, however, the {{introduction of}} GM technologies offers increased economic welfare through reduced commodity prices for consumers who are indifferent to the presence of GM traits and increased profits to producers who adopt GM technologies. This study develops the combinations of segregation costs and increased supplies that leave societal surplus unchanged. Any GM technology that yields a larger increase in supply for any segregation cost depicted in this relationship meets the compensation principle and, thus, improves societal welfare. In this case, market based adoption of these technologies improve economic surplus. On the other hand, technologies that yields less increase in supply for any segregation cost reduces societal welfare. Under this scenario, market based adoption will not be welfare improving and, hence, government regulation may be required. genetically modified (GM) <b>crops,</b> compensation principle, <b>segregation</b> costs, Pareto principle, immiserizing growth, Agricultural and Food Policy, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies,...|$|R
40|$|In the European Union nations, {{and other}} {{countries}} including Japan, Australia and Malaysia, it is a legal requirement that food products containing genetically modified organism (GMO) materials are labelled as such in order that customers may make informed purchasing decisions. For manufacturers and consumers to be confident about these assertions, systems must be in place along the entire food chain which support the co-existence of GM and non GM materials whilst maintaining a strict segregation between the two. This book is an output of a European Union-funded project entitled "Co-Extra: GM and non-GM food and feed supply chains: their Co-Existence and Traceability". The objective of this four year project is to provide practical tools and methods for implementing co-existence that will: enable the co-existence of genetically modified (GM) and non-GM <b>crops</b> enable the <b>segregation</b> and tracing of genetically modified organism (GMO) materials and derived products along the food and feed chains anticipate the future expansion {{of the use of}} GMOs The project is designed to foster a robustly science-based debate amongst all of the stakeholders involved in the food and feed chains, and the tools will be assessed not only from a technical point of view but with regard to the economic and legal aspects. It also surveys the GMO-related legal regimes and practices that exist in and beyond the EU. This book examines the practical tools and methods available to implement the co-existence and traceability of GM and non-GM food materials along the entire food and feed chains, as demanded by consumers and by legislation in force in the EU and elsewhere.
