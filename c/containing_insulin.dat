40|$|Insulin uptake and {{degradation}} {{is a complex}} and not yet completely understood process involving not only insulin sensitive tissues. The most important degradative system is insulin degrading enzyme which is a highly conserved metalloendopeptidase requiring Zn(++) for its proteolytic action, although protein disulfide isomerase and cathepsin D are also involved in insulin metabolism. The liver and the kidney are the principal sites for insulin clearance. In obese subjects with hyperinsulinemia {{and high levels of}} free fatty acids, insulin hepatic clearance is impaired, while the glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow and albumin excretion are increased, suggesting a state of renal vasodilatation leading to an abnormally transmitted arterial pressure to the glomerular capillaries through a dilated afferent arteriole.

40|$|A two-step culture {{system has}} been {{developed}} to analyze the role of hormones in casein accumulation by mammary epithelial cells obtained from adrenalectomized and ovariectomized adult virgin mice. In the first step cells are grown inside collagen gel in medium <b>containing</b> <b>insulin,</b> epidermal growth factor (EGF), and linoleic acid for 9 days; these conditions stimulate very little casein accumulation. Following this growth phase the gels are released to float in medium <b>containing</b> <b>insulin,</b> prolactin, and linoleic acid. During this second phase the mammary cells will accumulate large amounts of casein, {{but only in the}} simultaneous presence of insulin, prolactin, and linoleic acid; in the absence of linoleic acid casein accumulation is greatly reduced. The casein accumulation is not dependent on the presence of the glucocorticoid cortisol and will occur in spite of the presence of the antiglucocorticoid agent RU 38 486. To determine if the response to cortisol observed in organ culture by other investigators might be mediated by stromal cells, epithelial cells were grown in collagen gel under fatty acid-free conditions and then cocultured with explants of mammary fat pads from adult virgin mice with or without mammary parenchyma. The cocultures were performed in fatty acid-free medium <b>containing</b> <b>insulin</b> and prolactin with or without cortisol. In the majority of experiments the mammary epithelial cells in the collagen gel accumulate more casein in the presence of cortisol than in its absence, irrespective of the presence of mammary parenchyma in the explant. Thus, mammary epithelial cells are directly dependent on insulin and prolactin for casein accumulation and indirectly dependent on cortisol by means of its effect on the stromal cells. This cortisol effect may be to cause release into the medium of linoleic acid or a metabolic product of linoleic acid from the stromal cells...|$|E

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} {{is caused by}} the destruction of pancreatic β-cells by T cells of the immune system. Islet transplantation is a promising therapy for diabetes mellitus. Bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) have the capacity to differentiate into various cell lineages including endocrine cells of the pancreas. To investigate the conditions that allow BMSC to differentiate into insulin-producing cells, a novel in vitro method was developed by using the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). BMSC, cultured in presence of TSA, differentiated into islet-like clusters under appropriate culture conditions. These islet-like clusters were similar to the cells of the islets of the pancreas. The islet-like clusters showed endocrine gene expression typical for pancreatic β-cell development and function, such as insulin (I and II), glucagon, somatostatin, GLUT- 2, pancreatic duodenal homeobox- 1 (PDX- 1), and Pax 4. Immunocytochemistry confirmed islet-like clusters contained pancreatic hormones. The colocalization of insulin and C-peptide was also observed.

The median survival of free rat islets transplanted into the bone marrow or under the kidney capsule was 9 and 14 days, respectively, whereas that of free human islets was shorter, 7 days (bone marrow) and 10 days (kidney capsule).

A low basal level (0. 0009 %) of casein mRNA (mRNAcsn) sequences was detectable in the LA glands by a specific cDNA probe. Subsequent incubation of the LA glands for 3 days in medium <b>containing</b> <b>insulin</b> and prolactin or insulin and cortisol failed to elicit mRNAcsn above the basal level, indicating that neither prolactin nor cortisol alone can support casein gene expression.

40|$|Background: In {{addition}} to polypeptide hormones, pancreatic endocrine cells synthesize {{a variety of}} bioactive molecules including classical transmitters and neuropeptides. While these co-transmitters are thought {{to play a role}} in regulating hormone release little is known about how their secretion is regulated. Here I investigate the synthesis and release of neuropeptide Y from pancreatic beta cells. Methodology/Principal Findings: NPY appears to be an authentic co-transmitter in neonatal, but not adult, beta cells because (1) early in mouse post-natal development, many beta cells are NPY-immunoreactive whereas no staining is observed in beta cells from NPY knockout mice; (2) GFP-expressing islet cells from an NPY(GFP) transgenic mouse are insulin-ir; (3) single cell RT-PCR experiments confirm that the NPY(GFP) cells <b>contain</b> <b>insulin</b> mRNA, a marker of beta cells. The NPY-immunoreactivity previously reported in alpha and delta cells is therefore likely to be due to the presence of NPYrelated peptides. INS- 1 cells, a beta cell line, are also NPY-ir and contain NPY mRNA. Using the FMRFamide tagging technique, NPY secretion was monitored from INS- 1 beta cells with high temporal resolution. Peptide release was evoked by brief depolarizations and was potentiated by activators of adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A. Following a transient depolarization, NPY-containing dense core granules fused with the cell membrane and discharged their contents within a few milliseconds...|$|R

The ability of this modified insulin to stimulate rat epididymal adipocytes was (mean ± SD) 94 ± 9. 6 % (P, 0. 05) that of the control insulin. Nα,B 1 -Biotinylinsulin displaced 4 -hydroxyazobenzene- 2 ′-carboxylic acid from avidin, demonstrating affinity for this protein. The formation of the Nα,B 1 -biotinylinsulin-avidin complex was visualized by cellulose acetate electrophoresis at pH 4. Nα,B 1 -Biotinylinsulin combined with avidin attached to Sepharose to form affinity columns in which the hormone {{was attached to the}} support by strong noncovalent bonds. The determination of the loading of avidin-Sepharose columns with biotinylinsulin was greatly facilitated by the attached biotin which provided a marker whose concentration could be assessed accurately by titration with avidin.

To examine whether human platelets <b>contain</b> specific <b>insulin</b> receptors, washed human platelets suspended in Hepes buffer were incubated at 24 degrees C with 125 I-insulin in the presence and absence of unlabeled insulin and specific insulin binding was determined. Insulin binding by platelets increased progressively with time of incubation to reach a maximum at 3 h and was proportional to the number of platelets in the incubation mixture. Maximum insulin binding was observed at pH 8. Insulin degradation by platelets as assessed by TCA precipitability and reincubation studies was minimal. Scatchard analysis of the binding data and dissociation studies revealed evidence of negative cooperativity of the platelet insulin receptor. A high affinity dissociation constant of approximately equal to 3 X 10 (9) M- 1 was determined and the concentration of platelet insulin receptors was estimated as 25 binding sites/micron 2 platelet surface area.
