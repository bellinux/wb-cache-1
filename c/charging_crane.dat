2500|$|In 1990, Scottsdale Detective Jim Raines—a former Phoenix {{homicide}} investigator—reexamined {{the evidence}} from 1978 and persuaded the County Attorney to reopen the case. Although DNA testing of the blood found in Carpenter's rental car was inconclusive, Raines discovered an evidence photograph of the car's interior that appeared to show a piece of brain tissue. [...] The actual tissue samples recovered from the car had been lost, but an Arizona judge ruled that the new evidence was admissible. [...] In June 1992 Carpenter was arrested and <b>charged</b> with <b>Crane's</b> murder.|$|R

50|$|Desperate to {{save his}} {{marriage}} and escape from Theresa, Ethan requests a transfer at Crane Industries at Gwen's behest, and Julian arranges for Ethan, Gwen, and Jane to move to New Delhi, India. The three are ready to take off when Theresa reveals that the comatose Alistair left her in <b>charge</b> of <b>Crane</b> Industries, and she terminates Ethan's transfer. The Winthrops, penniless after Theresa blacklists Ethan and freezes their Crane-owned bank accounts, move to Grace Bennett's Bed and Breakfast. With Ethan unable to find work, Gwen begins searching for a job and eventually secures a position with the exclusive Collier & Company.

50|$|Authorities {{determined}} the escape plan was too elaborate for the inmates to have carried it out by themselves and {{felt it would}} require help from {{both inside and outside}} the jail. Investigators began looking into both the inmates and whether any jail staff had a hand in the escapes; in particular, investigations focused on how the inmates gained access to the locked pod doors. Based on surveillance footage of the second floor pod, policed <b>charged</b> Kolek, Lopez, <b>Crane</b> and Jones with three counts each of assisting escape and three counts each of harboring or aiding a felon for their alleged assistance in the escape. Police said they expected additional arrests as the investigation continues.|$|R

60|$|The {{spot where}} Maxwell wrought {{was at the}} extreme end of the {{unfinished}} part of the breakwater. He was busily engaged {{at the time in}} laying a large stone which hung suspended to a travelling-crane connected with the temporary works overhead. Joe refrained from interrupting him. Another man assisted him. In the diver fraternity, there are men who thoroughly understand all sorts of handicrafts--there are blacksmiths, carpenters, stone-masons, etcetera. Maxwell was a skilled mechanic, and could do his work as well under water as many a man does above it-- perhaps better than some! The bed for the stone had been carefully prepared on a mass of solid masonry which had been already laid. By means of the signal-line Maxwell directed the men in <b>charge</b> of the <b>crane</b> to move it forward, backward, to the right or to the left, as required. At last it hung precisely over the required spot, and was lowered into its final resting-place.|$|R
5000|$|A {{couple of}} weeks after her trial, Clark pressed charges of false arrest against the officer who had arrested her. The next day, the officer {{physically}} attacked Clark {{in the presence of}} witnesses for having brought <b>charges</b> against him. <b>Crane,</b> who initially went briefly to Philadelphia to escape the pressure of publicity, returned to New York to give testimony at Becker's trial despite advice given to him from Theodore Roosevelt, who was Police Commissioner at the time and a new acquaintance of Crane. [...] The defense targeted Crane: police raided his apartment and interviewed people who knew him, trying to find incriminating evidence in order to lessen the effect of his testimony. A vigorous cross-examination took place that sought to portray Crane as a man of dubious morals; while the prosecution proved that he frequented brothels, Crane claimed this was merely for research purposes. After the trial ended on October 16, the arresting officer was exonerated, but Crane's reputation was ruined.|$|R
