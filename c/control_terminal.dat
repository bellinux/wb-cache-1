25|$|In September 2013, the Air Force Special Operations Command {{tested the}} ability to rapidly deploy Predator aircraft. Two MQ-1s were loaded into a Boeing C-17 Globemaster III in a cradle system that also carried a <b>control</b> <b>terminal,</b> {{maintenance}} tent, and the crew. The test was to prove the UAVs could be deployed and set up at an expeditionary base within four hours of landing. In a recent undisclosed deployment, airmen set up a portable hangar in a tent and a wooden taxiway to operate MQ-1s for a six-week period.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory for}} this kind of {{avalanche}} transistor is described completely in the paper , which also shows that this semiconductor device structure is well suited for microwave power amplification. It can deliver several watts of radio frequency power at a frequency of several gigahertz and it also has a <b>control</b> <b>terminal,</b> the base. However, it is not widely used since it requires voltages exceeding 200 volts to work properly, while gallium arsenide or other compound semiconductor FETs deliver a similar performance while being easier to work with. A similar device structure, proposed more or less in the same period in the paper , was the IMPISTOR, being a transistor with IMPATT collector-base junction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{thyristor}} is a four-layered, three terminal semiconductor device, {{with each}} layer consisting of alternately N-type or P-type material, for example P-N-P-N. The main terminals, labelled anode and cathode, are across all four layers. The <b>control</b> <b>terminal,</b> called the gate, {{is attached to}} p-type material near the cathode. (A variant called an SCS—Silicon Controlled Switch—brings all four layers out to terminals.) The operation of a thyristor can {{be understood in terms}} of a pair of tightly coupled bipolar junction transistors, arranged to cause a self-latching action: ...|$|E
5000|$|Each {{process in}} the system had either a single <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal,</b> or no <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> at all. A process {{inherits}} its <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> from its parent. A <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> was acquired when a process with no <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> [...] a terminal device file that isn't already the <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> for some other process. All of the processes that had the same <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> {{were part of a}} single process group.|$|R
50|$|Each {{process in}} the system has either a single <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal,</b> or no <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> at all. A process {{inherits}} its <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> from its parent, and the only operations upon a process are acquiring a <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal,</b> by a process that has no <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal,</b> and relinquishing it, by a process that has a <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|R
5000|$|No {{portable}} way {{of acquiring}} a <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> is defined, the method being implementation defined. The standard defines the [...] flag for the [...] system call, {{which is the}} way of preventing what is otherwise the conventional way of acquiring a <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> (a process with no <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> s a terminal device file that isn't already the <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> for some other process, without specifying the [...] flag) but leaves its conventional semantics optional.|$|R
2500|$|The {{thyristor}} valve {{was first}} used in HVDC systems in 1972 on the Eel River Converter Station in Canada. The thyristor is a solid-state semiconductor device similar to the diode, but with an extra <b>control</b> <b>terminal</b> {{that is used to}} switch the device on at a defined instant. Because thyristors have breakdown voltages of only a few kilovolts each, HVDC thyristor valves are built using large numbers of thyristors connected in series. Additional passive components such as grading capacitors and resistors need to be connected in parallel with each thyristor {{in order to ensure that}} the voltage across the valve is shared uniformly between the thyristors. [...] The thyristor plus its grading circuits and other auxiliary equipment is known as a thyristor level.|$|E
50|$|Each motor {{controller}} in an MCC {{can be specified}} {{with a range of}} options such as separate control transformers, pilot lamps, control switches, extra <b>control</b> <b>terminal</b> blocks, various types of thermal or solid-state overload protection relays, or various classes of power fuses or types of circuit breakers. A motor control center can either be supplied ready for the customer to connect all field wiring, or can be an engineered assembly with internal control and interlocking wiring to a central <b>control</b> <b>terminal</b> panel board or programmable controller.|$|E
50|$|Three-terminal {{devices such}} as {{transistors}} and FETs also use {{a connection to the}} <b>control</b> <b>terminal</b> of the device being tested such as the Base or Gate terminal. For transistors and other current based devices, the base or other <b>control</b> <b>terminal</b> current is stepped. For field effect transistors, a stepped voltage is used instead. By sweeping the voltage through the configured range of main terminal voltages, for each voltage step of the control signal, a group of V-I curves is generated automatically. This group of curves makes it very easy to determine the gain of a transistor, or the trigger voltage of a thyristor or TRIAC.|$|E
50|$|A {{background}} process {{that attempts to}} read from or write to its <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> is sent a SIGTTIN (for input) or SIGTTOU (for output) signal. These signals stop the process by default, but {{they may also be}} handled in other ways. Shells often override the default stop action of SIGTTOU so that {{background process}}es deliver their output to the <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> by default.|$|R
5000|$|The SIGWINCH {{signal is}} sent to a process when its <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> changes its size (a window change).|$|R
5000|$|The SIGINFO {{signal is}} sent to a process when a status (info) request is {{received}} from the <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{change in}} Line 6's {{operation}} {{occurred during the}} 1970s: Kléber station was expanded to four tracks with two island platforms, a rare arrangement in the Paris Métro, and converted to the line's <b>control</b> <b>terminal,</b> with Étoile acting as a simple turn-around stop.|$|E

5000|$|The SIGINT {{signal is}} sent to a process by its <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> when a user wishes to {{interrupt}} the process. This is typically initiated by pressing , but on some systems, the [...] "delete" [...] character or [...] "break" [...] key can be used.|$|R
50|$|The {{role of the}} Royal Australian Corps of Transport is {{to control}} and operate Army-owned surface transport, other than unit transport, and to provide {{movement}} <b>control,</b> <b>terminal,</b> postal and Army aspects of air logistic support.

5000|$|The robot, [...] "piloted" [...] by Satoru {{from a large}} <b>control</b> <b>terminal</b> in his room, is nicknamed 'Hinokio' by his classmates.

But the story soon dwells more on Satoru, himself, as he rediscovers love and friendship through classmate Jun Kudo and also his own father.|$|E
5000|$|The SIGTSTP {{signal is}} sent to a process by its <b>controlling</b> <b>terminal</b> to request it to stop (terminal stop). It is {{commonly}} initiated by the user pressing [...] Unlike SIGSTOP, the process can register a signal handler for or ignore the signal.|$|R

50|$|The {{integrated}} gate-commutated thyristor (IGCT) is a {{power semiconductor}} electronic device, used for switching electric current in industrial equipment. It {{is related to the}} gate turn-off (GTO) thyristor. It was jointly developed by Mitsubishi and ABB. Like the GTO thyristor, the IGCT is a fully controllable power switch, meaning that it can be turned both on and off by its <b>control</b> <b>terminal</b> (the gate). Gate drive electronics are integrated with the thyristor device.|$|E
50|$|In principle, a {{transmission}} gate {{made up of}} two field-effect transistors, in which - in contrast to traditional discrete field effect transistors - the substrate terminal (Bulk) is not connected internally to the source terminal. The two transistors, an n-channel MOSFET and a p-channel MOSFET are connected in parallel with this, however, only the drain and source terminals of the two transistors are connected together. Their gate terminals are connected to each other via a NOT gate (inverter), to form the <b>control</b> <b>terminal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Royal Australian Corps of Transport (RACT) is a corps {{within the}} Australian Army.

50|$|A {{telecommunication}} {{control unit}} (TCU), line <b>control</b> unit, or <b>terminal</b> <b>control</b> unit (although <b>terminal</b> <b>control</b> unit may also refer to a terminal cluster controller) is a Front-end processor for mainframes and some minicomputers which supports attachment {{of one or more}} telecommunication lines. TCUs free processors from handling the data coming in and out of RS-232 ports. The TCU can support multiple terminals, sometimes hundreds. Many of these TCUs can support RS-232 when it is required, although there are other serial interfaces as well.|$|R
50|$|Terminal {{controllers}} {{are responsible}} for providing all ATC services within their airspace. Traffic flow is broadly divided into departures, arrivals, and overflights. As aircraft {{move in and out}} of the terminal airspace, they are handed off to the next appropriate control facility (a control tower, an en-route control facility, or a bordering terminal or approach <b>control).</b> <b>Terminal</b> control is responsible for ensuring that aircraft are at an appropriate altitude when they are handed off, and that aircraft arrive at a suitable rate for landing.|$|E
