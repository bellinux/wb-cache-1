50|$|Although {{there are}} many {{variations}} of the <b>basic</b> <b>body</b> <b>position</b> it essentially involves the skydiver {{moving out of the}} traditional face-to-earth & arched position, and straightening the legs, bringing the arms to the sides and de-arching, using the body to cup the air as a means of providing greater lift. There is, however, debate over what exactly constitutes the most efficient tracking position (providing the best glide ratio) especially concerning how far (if at all) the skydiver's legs should be spread. Some variations of the tracking position work well for some individuals and not so well for others. Also, when a skydiver gains experience, his or her preferred <b>body</b> <b>position</b> often changes.|$|R

We recorded five <b>basic</b> <b>body</b> <b>positions,</b> 24 behaviors, two food choices, and three feeding strategies utilized to open fruits of Syagrus romanzoffiana (Cham.), the main food source of Ingram's squirrels.

5000|$|Ergometer rowing {{machines}} (colloquially ergs or ergo) {{simulate the}} rowing action {{and provide a}} means of training on land when waterborne training is restricted, and of measuring rowing fitness. Ergometers do not simulate the lateral balance challenges, the exact resistance of water, or the exact motions of true rowing including the sweep of the oar handles. For that reason ergometer scores are generally not used as the sole selection criterion for crews (colloquially [...] "ergs don't float") , and technique training {{is limited to the}} <b>basic</b> <b>body</b> <b>position</b> and movements. However, this action can still allow a comparable workout to those experienced on the water.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify similarities and differences in functioning in AS and RA using the ICF as the framework for the description of functioning. Methods: The Comprehensive ICF Core Sets for RA and AS were compared qualitatively regarding their content. A comparison study of common second-level ICF categories from both ICF Core Sets collected in two different cross-sectional studies in the Netherlands was performed. Significant differences regarding the level of impairments, limitations or restrictions were analyzed within the Mann-Whitney U-Test. To study whether the common ICF categories have different meaning for the two populations the Rasch model for dichotomous response option was used. Results: The Comprehensive ICF Core Set for AS includes 74 ICF categories in 19 chapters and the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for RA includes 96 ICF categories in 22 chapters. Interviews among 87 patients with AS and 143 patients with RA on 24 of the common ICF categories revealed significant differences regarding the extent of problems. DIF analyses reflect that the meaning of some ICF categories, such as 'd 410 <b>Changing</b> <b>basic</b> <b>body</b> positions' is different in relation to functioning depending on the health condition. Conclusion: This study was the first to compare functioning in AS and RA based on the ICF. The results confirmed to a large extend the experiences well known from other studies and thereby showed that the ICF is useful to describe and compare functioning. Some aspects could be identified which are not easy to understand with existing evidence and need to be explained in the future...|$|R

40|$|Autobiographical {{memories}} can {{be considered}} experiences that are stored in highly distributed memory traces, which include perceptual details {{that were part of}} the original experience. Retrieval of autobiographical memories has been conceptualized as a process in which the original experience is recreated through reactivation of the perceptuomotor representations that were formed during the experience (e. g., Damasio, 1989). In this study, we focus on the role of <b>body</b> <b>position</b> and <b>body</b> movement in facilitating the retrieval of autobiographical memories. If <b>body</b> <b>position</b> during reactivation of the memory is similar (congruent) to the original event, relevant perceptuomotor areas should become reactivated and prime other relevant components of the experience, hence facilitating retrieval of the original experience. In contrast, a <b>body</b> <b>position</b> that is incongruent with that of the original experience should impair retrieval. We conducted an experiment to assess potential facilitation of congruent body posture on access to and retention of autobiographical memories in younger and older adults. Thirty-two younger and 30 older adults participated in an experiment in which they retrieved autobiographical memories either in a <b>body</b> <b>position</b> that was congruent with the <b>body</b> <b>position</b> {{at the time of the}} original experience, or an incongruent <b>body</b> <b>position.</b> For example, if the event to be retrieved was a time the participant went to the dentist office, the congruent <b>body</b> <b>position</b> was a supine position in a recliner that was brought into a horizontal <b>position.</b> The incongruent <b>body</b> <b>position</b> was a standing position with hands placed on the hips.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} the aerodynamic behaviour {{of a standard}} 2 -man bobsleigh including the crews. The <b>body</b> <b>position</b> of the brakeman was studied over a range of angles from 25 to 90 degrees relative to the wind direction. Wind tunnel experiments were undertaken on a 50 % scale model of 2 -man bobsleigh and the crews. Aerodynamic drag forces were measured over a range of wind speeds (40 to 120 km/h) in the wind tunnel environment. Additionally, wool tufts and smoke were used to visualise the airflow characteristics around the bobsleigh and crews. The {{results show that the}} body inclination angle of the brakeman has significant effect on the overall aerodynamics of bobsleighing and the most aerodynamic <b>body</b> <b>position</b> of the brakeman was found at 55 degree with the minimal drag. The results also indicate that this particular <b>body</b> <b>position</b> of the brakeman can reduce the drag over 10 % compared to his <b>body</b> <b>position</b> at 90 degree. However, the brakeman's <b>body</b> <b>position</b> over 35 degree indicates an increase of drag...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Muscle {{fatigue and}} the {{development}} of hand-related musculoskeletal injuries can be caused by <b>body</b> <b>positions</b> that fail to accommodate control interfaces such as control knobs. There appear to be limited studies that investigate how different selections of <b>body</b> <b>positions</b> affect various selections of knobs, despite the fact that some articles have presented theoretical associations between different <b>body</b> <b>positions</b> and knob shapes. The goal {{of this paper is to}} determine the influences of <b>body</b> <b>position</b> selections on the knob selections of manual workers from several Malaysian manufacturing industries. A survey and observational studies were conducted, with over 70 responses collected for the survey and 79 responses collected for the observation. The survey responses were entered into Minitab 16 for the analysis, while the observation responses were sorted by frequency. The results show that the majority of the workers normally and preferably use the standing, seated and kneeling position for their manual work. The selections of the <b>body</b> <b>positions</b> that the workers assume also considerably affect the knob selections...|$|R

40|$|URL] As a {{consequence}} of changes in apparatus structure and Code of Points, gymnasts are using the straight <b>body</b> <b>position</b> {{more and more in}} Uneven Bars routines. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to analyze the influence of âin barâ elements on <b>body</b> <b>position</b> during Uneven Bars routines. Observational methodology was used to construct and validate two observation categories comprising eleven variables considered as indicators of the external load in uneven bars. 83 uneven bars routines were analyzed from world championship and Olympic Games finals between 1989 and 2004. The principal results we observed were significant increases in the execution of âin barâ elements, with and without longitudinal rotations, as well as in respective difficulty. Straight <b>body</b> <b>position</b> elements increased from 6. 45 to 9. 71 up to 2001 and decreased to 7. 88 by 2004. Close <b>body</b> <b>position</b> elements ranged from 8. 15 to 8. 21 until 2001 and then increased to 10. 94 by 2004. We may conclude that compulsory use of âin barâ elements and their execution beyond Code requirements contradicted the trends towards increased use of straight <b>body</b> <b>positions...</b>|$|R
