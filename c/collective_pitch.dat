5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound helicopter was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E
25|$|Secondary flight {{controls}} include the rotor transmission clutch, {{also known as}} a pre-rotator, which when engaged drives the rotor to start it spinning before takeoff, and <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> to reduce blade pitch before driving the rotor. <b>Collective</b> <b>pitch</b> controls are not usually fitted to autogyros, but {{can be found on the}} Air & Space 18A and McCulloch J-2 and the Westermayr Tragschrauber and are capable of near VTOL performance. Unlike a helicopter, autogyros without <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> or another jump start facility need a runway to take off; however, they are capable of landing with a very short or zero ground roll. Like helicopters, each autogyro has a specific height–velocity diagram for safest operation, although the dangerous area is usually smaller than for helicopters.|$|E
25|$|The {{all-metal}} rotor blades, {{through which}} the compressed air travelled to be ejected at the blade tips, consist of a spar of ing thickness, a honeycomb-filled trailing edge, and feature faired roots in order to the increase their lift coefficient. According to aerospace publication Flight International, the blades possessed a highly homogenous structure, a highly finished surface and a constant profile, and could be easily dismantled to facilitate inspection of the main spar. Additionally, the blade had no risk of icing {{as a consequence of}} the internal current of warm air passing though. The Djinn used relatively standard flight controls, such as the <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> control (upon which the throttle was positioned) and adjustable friction trims.|$|E

40|$|As {{the wind}} turbine size has been {{increasing}} and their mechanical components are built lighter, {{the reduction of the}} structural loads becomes a very important task of wind turbine control in addition to maximum wind power capture. In this paper, we present a separate set of <b>collective</b> and individual <b>pitch</b> control algorithms. Both pitch control algorithms use the LQR control technique with integral action (LQRI), and utilize Kalman filters to estimate system states and wind speed. Compared to previous works in this area, our pitch control algorithms can control rotor speed and blade bending moments {{at the same time to}} improve the trade-off between rotor speed regulation and load reduction, while both <b>collective</b> and individual <b>pitch</b> controls can be designed separately. Simulation results show that the proposed <b>collective</b> and individual <b>pitch</b> controllers achieve very good rotor speed regulation and significant reduction of blade bending moments...|$|R
25|$|The Do 32 was {{structurally}} very simple, with {{a square}} section, tapering fuselage behind the pilot. The BMW 6012L turbine and compressor {{were placed on}} top of the fuselage, immediately behind the rotor pylon. Its exhaust impinged upon a large rectangular rudder, built to resist thermal stresses, for yaw control. The horizontal tailplane was swept. The pilot sat in front of the rotor pylon, on a simple seat, carried on the lower longerons. He controlled the plane of the two-bladed rotor directly with a long curved hanging arm, and its pitch with a conventional <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> lever by his left side. The rudder pedals were almost straight {{out in front of him}} on a strut that also carried, beyond his feet, some simple instruments. This member also formed part of the simple three-legged undercarriage, each strut ending with an unsprung foot.|$|E
25|$|Control of the V-12 {{presented}} {{several problems}} to the designers and engineers {{due to the}} sheer size {{as well as the}} rotor layout. The pilot and co-pilot sat in the lower flight deck with a wide expanse of windows to give excellent visibility. Using conventional cyclic stick, collective lever and rudder pedals the pilots input their commands in a conventional fashion. Roll control is by differential <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> change on the left and right rotors, ensuring that sufficient lift is generated to prevent inadvertent sink. Yaw in the hover or low air speeds is achieved by tilting the rotor discs forward and backward deferentially depending on direction of yaw required. At higher air speeds differential rotor control is gradually supplanted by the large aerodynamic rudder on the fin. Ascent and descent are controlled by the collective lever increasing or decreasing pitch of both rotors simultaneously. Large elevators on the tailplane control fuselage attitude and provide reaction to pitching moments from the wing and variation on rotor disc angle.|$|E
2500|$|The S-67 {{featured}} a five-bladed main rotor and tail rotor. The main rotor {{was taken from}} the S-61, but was modified to have a hub fairing, swept main rotor blade tips and a special [...] "alpha-1" [...] linkage which was added to the main rotor controls to increase <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> sensitivity and so extend the <b>collective</b> <b>pitch</b> range. The 20° swept main rotor blade tips help to overcome a phenomenon called sub-multiple oscillating track (SMOT) that causes variations in tip track at high Mach numbers. [...] These allowed the S-67 to achieve and maintain high cruise speeds. To reduce drag at high speed, the mainwheels retracted fully into the stub wing sponsons. It had speed brakes on the wing trailing edges {{that could be used to}} decrease speed or increase maneuverability.|$|E

2500|$|Though a {{much larger}} aircraft, the G.11E used the same coaxial, three blade twin rotor layout as on the Gyroplane Laboratoire. It was {{initially}} powered by a fan cooled [...] Potez 9E nine cylinder radial engine mounted amidships, under the concentric rotor shafts. [...] There was 6.5:1 speed reduction gearing between the engine and the rotor drive. The rotors are built around tapered tube spars, which carry ribs and are Dural clad at the leading edges and with alloy over 3-ply elsewhere. They are mounted on flapping hinges and have drag hinge dampers.

In autumn 1935, the Gyroplane, registered G-ADMV, first flew at Heston Aerodrome, piloted by V.H. Baker. On 6 February 1937, it flew at Hanworth Air Park, having been modified as the Mark 2 version. It was tested at Farnborough, and leased to the Royal Aircraft Establishment for research, but it was scrapped during the second world war. A two-seat A.R.IV and three-seat A.R.V were planned, but construction was stopped when Hafner was interned under Defence Regulation 18B.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{nonlinearities}} {{on the design of}} a constrained optimal controller for spar-type floating wind turbines. The considered nonlinearities are due to wind speed variation and actuator saturation. The <b>collective</b> blade <b>pitch</b> actuator, usually employed for aerodynamic rotor speed regulation, is adopted for the mitigation of platform pitch vibrations as well. The wind speed effects and the control law are obtained from a linearized rigid-body dynamic model, taking into account persistent disturbances related to wind turbulence and wave induced loads, which are estimated using the Blade Element Momentum aerodynamic theory and Morison equation, respectively. A performance analysis is carried out for several operating points in the above rated wind speed region, considering the reduction of the platform pitch motion as the main control objective. The simulation results show that the designed fixed-gain multivariable controller can yield significant vibration reduction in comparison with a baseline gain-scheduled proportional-integral controller {{in the presence of the}} considered nonlinearities...|$|R

40|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicle propulsion has been primarily driven by conventional thruster arrangements and control fins. The {{development of a}} <b>collective</b> and cyclic <b>pitch</b> propeller system provides a highly maneuverable alternative to these conventional designs. Therefore, a computer controlled and fully actuated <b>collective</b> and cyclic <b>pitch</b> propeller was designed and fabricated to fulfill this need. [...] The new propeller was designed using a helicopter like linkage system. The swash plates mounted inside of the propeller housing, as opposed to propeller hub like a helicopter. Locating the linkages in the housing provided a more maintainable system of linkages, due to space limitations in the propeller hub. The swash plate was positioned using three ball screw electric actuators using absolute positioning feedback. The swash plate position was transmitted to the propeller hub {{by a set of}} four control rods, one for each blade.

A land-based NREL 5 MW variable speed pitch reg- ulated wind turbine is considered as a reference. The conventional <b>collective</b> blade <b>pitch</b> angle controller strategy with independent pitch actuators control is used for load reduction. The wind turbine class is IEC-BII. The main purpose is to investigate the severity of end effects on structural loads and responses and consequently identify the high-risk components according to the type and amplitude of fault using a servo-aero-elastic simulation code, HAWC 2. Both transient and steady state effects of faults are studied. Such information is useful for wind turbine fault detection and identification as well as system reliability analysis. Results show the effects of faults on wind turbine power output and responses. Pitch sensor faults mainly affects the vibration of shaft main bearing, while generator power and aerodynamic thrust are not changed significantly, due to independent pitch actuator control of three blades. Shaft speed sensor faults can seriously affect the generator power and aerodynamic thrust. Pitch actuator faults can result in fully pitching of the blade, and consequently rotor stops due to negative aerodynamic torque...|$|R
