25|$|With an {{axle load}} of , the AA {{had reached the}} design limits of size and power {{possible}} with a two coupled axle locomotive type with Victoria's relatively light track infrastructure. Its high tractive effort and limited adhesive weight (due to axle load constraints and only two powered axles) combined to produce a less than ideal factor of adhesion of 3.5. Future VR locomotive designs were based on three or four <b>coupled</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was the Eastern Region's Motive Power officer, L.P. Parker, {{who made}} the case for a new design of {{powerful}} freight locomotive, able to shift heavy loads at fast speeds in round trips between distant destinations within the eight-hour shift of the footplate crew. Riddles took up the challenge, initially designing a 2-8-2 locomotive, but settled upon the 2-10-0 wheel arrangement for the increased traction and lower axle load that five <b>coupled</b> <b>axles</b> can provide. The resultant design {{became one of the most}} successful locomotive classes ever constructed in Britain.|$|E
25|$|The Class GL {{made use}} of Beyer, Peacock's {{standard}} lever-actuated Sterling-type steam-operated power reverser and a Pyle National Company turbo-generator. The piston valves were modern straight-ported types with long-lap, long-travel valves, used {{for the first time}} in a South African Garratt which made the Class GL very free-running and more efficient than its predecessors. The cylinders, of the same bore and stroke as those of the Class 14, drove the third <b>coupled</b> <b>axles</b> using long connecting rods which stabilised the locomotive by reducing vertical forces at the crosshead to a minimum. This method of design became the standard on most Beyer-Garratts thereafter.|$|E
50|$|The C V had a four-cylinder de Glehn {{compound}} engine. Its low-pressure cylinders were external, {{operating on}} the second <b>coupled</b> <b>axle,</b> and were located between the bogie and the first <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b> The high-pressure cylinders were internal and worked the first <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b> The engines still lacked a superheater. In terms of its power (160 tons at top speed), the C V could only {{be used for a}} few years in heavy express train services. As early as 1903 the locomotives were relegated to secondary duties, but even there they did not stay long.|$|R
50|$|The {{saturated}} steam drive {{was on the}} outside and had slide valves. The cylinders were set horizontally and drove the third <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b> The running gear was supported at three points. Th first and second <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> were supported on common carrying springs and the third on a transverse leaf spring.|$|R

25|$|Railroads {{generally}} preferred locomotives {{with fewer}} axles, to reduce maintenance costs. The {{number of axles}} required was dictated by the maximum axle loading of the railroad in question. A builder would typically add axles until the maximum weight on any one axle was acceptable to the railroad's maximum axle loading. A locomotive with a wheel arrangement of two lead axles, two drive axles, and one trailing axle was a high-speed machine. Two lead axles were necessary to have good tracking at high speeds. Two drive axles had a lower reciprocating mass than three, four, five or six <b>coupled</b> <b>axles.</b> They were thus able to turn at very high speeds due to the lower reciprocating mass. A trailing axle was able to support a huge firebox, hence most locomotives with the wheel arrangement of 4-4-2 (American Type Atlantic) were called free steamers {{and were able to}} maintain steam pressure regardless of throttle setting.|$|E
500|$|The Matheran Light Railway is a {{mountain}} railway near Mumbai, India, and opened in 1905. Unusually for a railway for which Caltrhrop was consulting engineer, {{it was of}} [...] gauge, with tight curves and 1 in 20 (5%) grades. Calthrop designed a 0-6-0T with Klein-Linder articulated <b>coupled</b> <b>axles</b> to provide a flexible wheelbase, and four were supplied by Orenstein & Koppel. Calthrop's firm also supplied the wagon stock and the points and crossings for the railway.|$|E
500|$|Problems {{with the}} class were {{experienced}} immediately, with the first 25 locomotives being withdrawn in October 1951 after several complaints were received from crews regarding the driving wheels shifting on their axles. They were subsequently modified, and released back into revenue-earning service. [...] Initially the return cranks on the main driving wheels were of LNER block type, as seen on Arthur Peppercorn's A1s and A2s, but this was changed to the simpler LMS four-stud fitting. This {{was the result of}} a problem of overheating bearings within the cranks, and difficulty in removing the LNER-type casings. 70035–70039 were built with roller bearings on the leading and trailing <b>coupled</b> <b>axles</b> only and plain bearings on the remaining axles, whilst 70040–70049 were built with plain bearings throughout. However throughout their service the roller bearings used in remaining cases showed no advantage in reliability or cost.|$|E
25|$|To this end, the H {{class had}} a {{significantly}} different arrangement for its third cylinder. A German Henschel & Son conjugated valve gear mechanism, driven from the combination levers of the Walschaert valve gear for the outside cylinders, was utilised in favour of the Gresley mechanism. The inside cylinder was also positioned further forward of the outside cylinders and drove the leading <b>coupled</b> <b>axle,</b> with the outside cylinders driving the second <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
500|$|Three [...] {{diameter}} cylinders {{drove the}} centre <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b> The inside cylinder was steeply inclined at 1:7.5 but the outside cylinders were horizontal.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had an outside, twin-cylinder {{wet steam}} engine and an inside Allan valve gear. The connecting rod drove the second <b>coupled</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{town was}} {{authorised}} to tender construction and operation {{to one or}} more contractors. It quickly chose the only serious candidate, Gustav Palmer Harding, a British citizen. He was the continental representative of Merryweather & Sons, builders of steam tram engines. This decision knitted the close railway links between the city and Great Britain that remained for nearly half a century. Naturally, Mr Harding wanted to promote his company's machines, so he long made his views known to the municipal authorities. Finally convinced, they authorised him to use steam power from Maromme (Line 1), entering service on 29 December 1877. Merryweather & Sons, whose depot was on the Avenue du Mont-Riboudet, provided the tram units. Small and light — [...] — these reversible locomotives had two <b>coupled</b> <b>axles,</b> fully covered by a wooden body. They looked the same as a normal carriage so as not to frighten the horses. These steam carriages had enclosed lower decks; the upper decks were roofed but had open sides.|$|E
2500|$|In 1936, the Victorian Railways Design Office {{finalised}} {{the major}} design requirements for a steam locomotive that {{was capable of}} hauling a load of [...] at a minimum [...] up Ingliston Bank. In order to develop the power required, a very large grate and a very large boiler were needed, and the 4-8-4 wheel arrangement enabled this by using a four-wheel trailing truck to support a large firebox, and four <b>coupled</b> <b>axles</b> to support a large boiler and ensure a good factor of adhesion.|$|E

5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> for the inside cylinders and the middle <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer blow. The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|R

50|$|The bogie {{comprises}} a {{carrying axle}} {{connected to a}} <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> via a shaft or lever. In straight running, any radial movement of the carrying axle results in a sideways movement of the <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> in the opposite direction. However, the carrying axle is centred by means of two heavy duty springs just behind it. In addition the pivot pin may be allowed to move sideways, but again is held centrally by heavy springs. When travelling round a curve, the carrying axle swings to one side causing the <b>coupled</b> <b>axle</b> to move sideways in the opposite direction. In this way radial forces during curve running {{are more or less}} evened out on both axles, so that riding qualities similar to those of a normal bogie are achieved and wear and tear reduced on wheel flanges and rails.|$|R
