5000|$|A {{fundamental}} {{hypothesis of}} <b>case</b> <b>grammar</b> is that grammatical functions, such as subject or object, {{are determined by}} the deep, semantic valence of the verb, which finds its syntactic correlate in such grammatical categories as Subject and Object, and in grammatical cases such as Nominative, Accusative, etc. Fillmore (1968) puts forwards the following hierarchy for a universal subject selection rule: ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Case</b> <b>grammars</b> {{provide a}} natural basis for an {{object-oriented}} analysis of software requirements. Two important areas of object-oriented requirements analysis are addressed: (1) identification of entities {{which should be}} modeled as objects in the software design; and (2) detection of inconsistencies in the requirements documents. Available heuristics to identify these entities are based on intuitive criteria, relegating much of the endeavor to intuition. <b>Case</b> <b>grammars</b> capture these intuitive criteria in a systematic way. We propose a set of refined heuristic rules to enhance the identification procedures. The proposed extensions further improve the requirements analysis process by focusing on basic verbs which are relevant to software design. These heuristics are embedded in an implemented system {{that is capable of}} parsing the input requirements and extracting the objects, actions, and attributes for use in creating an object-oriented model of the requirements.

5000|$|Eastern Slavonic {{languages}} are synthetic languages. The {{feature of the}} last are <b>grammar</b> <b>cases</b> and <b>grammar</b> gender. Unlike analytic languages which use prepositions (like [...] "to", [...] "at", [...] "on" [...] etc. in English) to convey the links and relations between words in a sentence, suffixes are used much more broadly than prepositions. It means that it is required to change the word {{with the help of}} some suffix to integrate it into the sentence and to build a grammatically correct sentence. Names are not exceptions (in contradistinction to the German language, which uses <b>grammar</b> <b>cases</b> and <b>grammar</b> genders, but makes an exception for names due to its less synthetic nature). Family names are declined based on the Slavonic case system.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, he {{published}} {{his theory of}} <b>Case</b> <b>Grammar</b> (Fillmore 1968), which highlighted the fact that syntactic structure can be predicted by semantic participants. An action can have an agent, a patient, purposes, locations, and so on. These participants were called [...] "cases" [...] in his original paper, but later {{came to be known}} as semantic roles or thematic relations, which are similar to theta roles in generative grammar.|$|E

5000|$|Frame {{semantics}} is {{a theory}} of linguistic meaning developed by Charles J. Fillmore that extends his earlier <b>case</b> <b>grammar.</b> It relates linguistic semantics to encyclopedic knowledge.The basic idea is that one cannot {{understand the meaning of}} a single word without access to all the essential knowledge that relates to that word. For example, one {{would not be able to}} understand the word [...] "sell" [...] without knowing anything about the situation of commercial transfer, which also involves, among other things, a seller, a buyer, goods, money, the relation between the money and the goods, the relations between the seller and the goods and the money, the relation between the buyer and the goods and the money and so on.|$|E
25|$|This is {{resolved}} {{in various ways}} in different languages. Sometimes the grammar is modified {{so that it is}} unambiguous, such as by requiring an endif statement or making else mandatory. In other <b>cases</b> the <b>grammar</b> is left ambiguous, but the ambiguity {{is resolved}} by making the overall phrase grammar context-sensitive, such as by associating an else with the nearest if. In this latter <b>case</b> the <b>grammar</b> is unambiguous, but the context-free grammar is ambiguous.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Case</b> <b>grammar</b> is {{a system}} of {{linguistic}} analysis, focusing on {{the link between the}} valence, or number of subjects, objects, etc., of a verb and the grammatical context it requires. The system was created by the American linguist Charles J. Fillmore in (1968), in the context of Transformational Grammar. This theory analyzes the surface syntactic structure of sentences by studying the combination of deep cases (i.e. semantic roles) -- Agent, Object, Benefactor, Location or Instrument—which are required by a specific verb. For instance, the verb [...] "give" [...] in English requires an Agent (A) and Object (O), and a Beneficiary (B); e.g. [...] "Jones (A) gave money (O) to the school (B).|$|E

40|$|<b>Case</b> <b>grammar</b> {{is a model}} {{widely used}} by field {{linguists}} for studying actual human languages. It is an extension to the semantic domain of the syntactic "case endings" used by many languages, such as German and ancient Greek and Latin, to mark the role of nouns in sentences (for example, as subject or object). Studies {{of a wide range}} of human languages suggest that all human languages share a common set of such semantic cases, though they may mark them in different ways. Thus cases represent a fundamental characteristic of human cognition that can be of great value in engineering systems that must interact with humans. This paper surveys three agent-based systems in which ITI has used <b>case</b> <b>grammar</b> as an engineering tool at three different levels. It is drawn largely from the full papers referenced in the introduction below. These examples show that <b>case</b> <b>grammar</b> provides an integrating framework for constructing the internal knowledge representation system of a single agent, for identifying the agents that are active in a domain, and for defining an abstract space within which the behaviors of agents can be described.

This also allows the tester to encode applicationspecific knowledge (such as corner cases of particular interest) as part of the grammar, and to specify test heuristics by assigning probabilistic weights to production rules.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 96 - 99) Simple predicate adjective sentences {{are examined}} in this study within a <b>case</b> <b>grammar</b> framework. Modifications of the current <b>case</b> <b>grammar</b> model are suggested as necessary for the analysis of such sentences. The proposed revisions are based on the writer's native understanding of English syntax. The revised theory is then tested against sentences in English, Thai and Japanese. <b>Case</b> <b>grammar</b> as developed by Charles Fillmore and described in "The Case for Case" (1968) is described in Chapter 1, along with some of William Chafe's (1970) related views on a semantically-based linguistic model. Modifications in case theory are suggested in Chapter 2, regarding the treatment of adjectives. Both Chafe and Fillmore analyze verbs as central in sentence formation, and sentences are assumed to consist of various noun-verb relationships. Adjectives are considered a sub-class of verbs. It is proposed in this study that, rather than being analyzed as members of a single category VERB, adjectives and verbs should be distinguished from one another according to the exact semantic role they play in a given sentence. It is also proposed that not all sentences be analyzed as having a central underlying verb, since certain kinds of sentences may not contain deep structure verbs. Verbs are defined as conveying either an action or a psychological event. Sentences involving actions or psychological events (know, love) are assumed to have a central verb, and that verb determines the nature of the case relations occurring in the sentence.

40|$|Ireland. Research {{into the}} {{computational}} {{properties of the}} human metaphor faculty can be categorized according to two different perspectives: the lexico-semantic approach, most favoured by linguists, which sees metaphor as a predominantly linguistic phenomenon and thus attempts to model it as such; and the conceptual approach, which sees metaphor as a deep-seated cognitive agency that systematically organizes much, if not all, of our conceptual architecture. Both of these perspectives have brought different algorithmic and representational apparatus {{to bear on the}} task of metaphor interpretation and generation, but each is incomplete in itself. The lexicosemantic approach provides a good account of how different word combinations can give rise to creative figurality, while the conceptual approach explicates the deep structural mechanics of metaphor and analogy, connecting both into the breadth of world knowledge. This paper presents an integrated view of metaphor that unifies the lexico-semantic and conceptual approaches, explaining how metaphor is governed both by word and world knowledge.
