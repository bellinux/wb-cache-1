5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} spans extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} spans were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach spans were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being concrete slab construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the <b>center</b> <b>span</b> of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river. The <b>center</b> <b>span</b> was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses. Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach spans by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two main trusses, one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at midspan on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining spans. At the top of the main trusses were the deck trusses, 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the main trusses. The transverse deck beams, part of the deck truss, rested on top of the main trusses. These deck beams supported longitudinal deck stringers 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. The deck was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main spans. The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|E

25|$|Prior {{to work on}} the new bridge, work crews {{constructed}} and opened a temporary bridge just {{to the north of the}} new bridge. The temporary bridge allowed for the relocation of utilities, construction of an improved river wall and uninterrupted substructure construction for the new bridge. The <b>center</b> <b>span</b> was constructed on three barges in the Chicago River, because of Coast Guard regulations that required the channel to be open at all times. After the <b>center</b> <b>span</b> was constructed, it was towed to the bridge, where 16 jacks lifted the span into place.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to {{the high number of}} suicide attempts from the bridge, the state of Florida installed six crisis hotline phones along the <b>center</b> <b>span</b> in 1999, and began 24-hour patrols. As of 2003, the call center at the Crisis Center of Tampa Bay received 18 calls from potential jumpers, all of whom survived, according to a St. Petersburg Times report. However, the total number of jumpers has not significantly declined since the introduction of these safeguards.|$|E
25|$|When either {{wheel is}} {{deflected}} upward, the <b>center</b> <b>span</b> {{of the spring}} (the portion between the pivotable mounts) deflects downward. If both wheels deflect upward {{at the same time}} (for example, when hitting a bump in the road) the center section bends uniformly between the pivot mounts. In a roll, only one wheel is deflected upwards, which tends to form the center of the spring into an S-shaped curve. The result is that the wheel rate of one side of the suspension depends on the displacement of the other side. The extent to which the spring acts as an anti-roll bar depends on the distance between the pivot mounts and their rigidity.|$|E
25|$|The road {{across the}} span was {{originally}} two-way, plus {{there was a}} sidewalk along the south side. On January 25, 1914, the span unexpectedly opened during a windstorm, and trapped a young man on the open swing span section until the bridge operators could row out to the <b>center</b> <b>span</b> and use the turn-key to put the span back into proper position. The state took over ownership of the span in 1938. In June 1952, the span was opened {{for the first time}} in 25 years to allow an Army Corp of Engineers vessel to pass, and the span opened for the final time in October 1960. In the 1980s the swivel became inoperable. The bridge was nominated for listing on the National Register of Historic Places about 2006. In March 2007, planned maintenance and re-painting began on the bridge, closing the bridge to traffic at times. The $2.5 million project was completed in October 2007.|$|E

Some of the local commanders thought that had the North Koreans bypassed this bridge and crossed the Naktong farther east there would have been nothing between them and Pusan. However, North Korean attacks against 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry occurred nightly. The approaches to the bridge on the north side were mined. At one time there were about 100 North Korean dead lying in that area. From September 9 to 16, there were limited attacks on the 35th Infantry's front but most of the North Koreans' momentum had been broken and they could not muster strong attacks against the regiment again.|$|E

However, this celebration attracted 750,000 to 1,000,000 people, and ineffective crowd control meant the bridge became congested with roughly 300,000 people, causing the <b>center</b> <b>span</b> of the bridge to flatten out under the weight. Although the bridge is designed to flex in that way under heavy loads, and was estimated not to have exceeded 40% of the yielding stress of the suspension cables, bridge officials stated that uncontrolled pedestrian access was not being considered {{as part of the}} 75th anniversary on Sunday, May 27, 2012, because of the additional law enforcement costs required [...] "since 9/11".|$|E
