5|$|I {{remember}} {{when they came}} to record 'Spice Up Your Life'. It {{was in the middle of}} the chaos. It had been booked in, that they were <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> record their next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can you possibly do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E
5|$|Meckiff {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Victoria in 1956–57 against Western Australia. <b>Coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> bat with his state's score at 8 wickets for 77 (8/77), he made 19 {{not out to}} help them reach 131, before taking three wickets for 45 runs (3/45) to restrict Western Australia to a 34-run first innings lead. His first wicket was future Australian captain Bob Simpson for a duck, and he followed up by removing Test batsmen Barry Shepherd and Ken Meuleman. Meckiff made 11 in the second innings and took 0/40 as Victoria lost by four wickets.|$|E
5|$|Prost went on {{a sabbatical}} year in 1992, which was {{dominated}} by Nigel Mansell in a Williams-Renault. Prost performed pre-season testing for Ligier early in 1992 and later turned down an offer to drive for the team. After hearing that Prost would be his teammate again in 1993, Mansell left Williams to race in the CART series. The Frenchman had a clause in his contract which prevented rival Ayrton Senna from joining the team that year. Prost {{was part of a}} new-look driver line-up at Williams, with test driver Damon Hill <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> replace Riccardo Patrese, who had left to join Benetton.|$|E
5000|$|The 2014 {{edition of}} the cup saw triumph of Epiphaneia a horse which went off at 15-1, with Just Away <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> second <b>to</b> place and Spielberg <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> third <b>to</b> show. [...] Among the other horses the {{stallion}} bested was then five year old philly, Gentildonna, who was attempting to win the race for a third consecutive time.|$|R

5|$|The {{day after}} the Test, the Australians moved onto their next match against Derbyshire, where Miller scored 57 and took 3/31 in the first innings but bowled only two overs as Australia won by an innings. In a rain-affected draw against Glamorgan, Miller took 2/41 in the hosts' first innings of 197 before {{compiling}} a hard-hitting 84. <b>Coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> join Hassett with the score at 2/67, he struck five sixes and seven fours. He hit one of the sixes with one hand, sending it 20 rows into the crowd. Miller also attacked the Glamorgan captain Wilf Wooller, hitting him over the sightscreen with straight drives from consecutive balls and lofting a third six over long off. He was finally dismissed while attempting another six; Australia's first innings was washed out at 3/215.|$|E
5|$|There was {{resistance}} from the air, though. As the fifth wave of seven LCIs was <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> Red Beach, they were attacked by six Zeke fighters and three Betty bombers that dropped twelve bombs. One hit the deck of USS LCI-339 forward of the conning tower; another two were near misses. Badly damaged and riddled by bullets and fragments, the ship caught fire. LCI-339 remained on the beach, where she served as a landmark for Japanese aircraft. She was eventually towed off the beach, but then drifted onto a reef and became a total loss. USS LCI-341 suffered a near miss that tore a huge hole in its side. Eight Australians were killed, including Lieutenant Colonel R. E. Wall, the commanding officer of the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion, and 45 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{spent most}} of 1952 with the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association, but he also pitched a few games for the Reds during the 1952 Cincinnati Reds season. He pitched in two games for the Reds in 1952, <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> finish both games for the Reds. He pitched three shutout innings, {{allowing}} three hits in these two games. During his time with the Brewers, he pitched in 21 games. He started 19 of the 21 games, won ten and lost three, and had a 3.96 ERA. As the 1953 season began, Blake again had a stint with Cincinnati, but {{spent most of}} the season with the Indianapolis Indians. He pitched in one game for the Reds on April 17, 1953 against the Milwaukee Brewers, allowing two earned runs on a hit and a walk without getting a batter out. During his time with the Indianapolis Indians, he pitched in 29 games, and was the workhorse of the Indians' squad. He finished the season with a 14–7 record, a 3.76 ERA, and 208 innings pitched, and led the team in wins, innings pitched, and starting appearances.|$|E

5|$|The match itself {{swirled around}} {{controversy}} between Abiodun Okulaja's (the center referee) calls and officiating. The most questionable calls were associated {{the severity of}} cards distributed to players and a late-match decision to award a penalty kick to the United, in which many claimed was a fake trip in the box. One controversial call came from a reckless challenge by Galaxy midfielder, Beckham, to United forward, Josh Wolff in the 40th minute. Following the referee stopping play to call the foul, a verbal exchange between Beckham and United's Santino Quaranta resulted in a swarm of United and Galaxy players <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> push the two apart. While Quaranta was not carded for his exchange with Beckham, Beckham was carded for his foul against Wolff in the 37th minute and Davies' penalty kick in the 91st. The goal received much national attention from the controversy surrounding the decision to award a penalty, and Davies' celebration for successfully converting the kick. Subsequent to the match, center referee Abiodun Okulaja ejected Galaxy midfielder Jovan Kirovski for cursing at him while sniping his decision.|$|E
5|$|The use of Yehudi {{lights to}} {{camouflage}} aircraft by matching their luminance with the background sky was developed, in part, by the US Navy's Project Yehudi from 1943 onwards, following pioneering {{experiments in the}} Canadian diffused lighting camouflage project for ships early in the Second World War. A Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, had serendipitously stumbled upon the principle when he saw an aircraft <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> land over snow suddenly vanish; {{he realized that the}} reflected light had increased its brightness just enough to match the background sky. The ships were fitted with ordinary projectors mounted on small platforms fixed to their sides, with the projectors pointing inwards at the ship's side. The brightness was adjusted to match the brightness of the sky. The Canadian experiment showed that such counter-illumination camouflage was possible, arousing interest in both Britain and America, but the equipment was cumbersome and fragile, and neither the Royal Canadian Navy nor their allies brought it into production.|$|E
25|$|Clarke {{scored a}} century against Lancashire in the 2012 County Championship; <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> bat with the score on 81/7, Clarke built a {{partnership}} of 224runs with Darren Maddy, four runs short of Warwickshire's {{record for the}} 8th wicket.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} of the Cricket World Cup 2011, Gambhir scored a solid knock of 97 from 122 balls. <b>Coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> bat in the first over after the {{dismissal}} of Virender Sehwag, he anchored the Indian inning despite the early dismissal of both the openers. He had a good partnership first with Kohli, and then a match-winning partnership of 109 runs with MS Dhoni.|$|E

25|$|It {{was also}} {{testified that the}} Yak pilot was doing {{aerobatics}} prior to the accident; the Soviet Air Force had not informed Royal Air Force air traffic controllers at Gatow of its presence. They claimed that the fighter was <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> land at Dallgow, a nearby Soviet airbase (although examination of the wreckage showed that the undercarriage was still locked up, so this was unlikely).|$|E
25|$|Although {{the general}} public were unaware, {{chairman}} Peter Ridsdale had taken out large loans against the prospect of gate receipts from Champions League games. As Leeds had failed {{to qualify for the}} competition, there was simply not enough money <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> repay the debt. The first indication that the club was in financial trouble was the sale of Rio Ferdinand to Manchester United for £30million, a world record for a defender. O'Leary and Ridsdale publicly fell out over the sale.|$|E
25|$|A side {{made up of}} some of {{the leading}} players from Associate and Affiliate teams was put {{together}} to face England in Dubai in January 2012. The three-day match was part of England's preparation for a series against Pakistan later that month. Along with Craig Williams, Viljoen was one of two Namibia players included in the 12-man squad. <b>Coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> bat at 90/6, Viljoen top-scored with 98runs from 189balls against a bowling line-up including James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, and Graeme Swann.|$|E

25|$|In July 2000, Kent's {{away match}} against Hampshire at Portsmouth {{was billed as}} a {{showdown}} between two great cricketers- Warne and Dravid. Dravid came out on top. On a dustbowl, tailor made to suit home team spinners, Warne took 4 wickets but could not take the all important wicket of Dravid. <b>Coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> bat at 15/2, Dravid faced 295 balls scoring 137 runs – his maiden hundred in county championships. Dravid scored 73 not out in the 2nd innings guiding Kent to a six wicket victory as Warne went wicketless.|$|E
25|$|This was Shane Bond's first {{match against}} a team other than Zimbabwe since {{his return from}} injury, and Bond {{returned}} in style to inspire yet another ODI defeat for India. It was a match of two batting collapses, however, as Indian pacemen Irfan Pathan and Ashish Nehra used the conditions well to take five wickets in New Zealand first 13 overs. Lou Vincent, Stephen Fleming, Nathan Astle and Hamish Marshall all fell for single-figure scores, and with Jacob Oram and Craig McMillan <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> bat, the score was 36 for 5.|$|E
25|$|Every {{year from}} {{the last week of}} April {{to the end of the}} first week of May, Wenatchee hosts the Washington State Apple Blossom Festival, which {{probably}} brings in the largest number of people Wenatchee sees annually, with the exception of all the migrant workers <b>coming</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> pick the crop. It features two relatively large parades: the Apple Blossom Youth Parade on the last Saturday in April and the Apple Blossom Grand Parade on the first Saturday in May, a food fair representing cuisine from around the world, and a traveling carnival.|$|E

I marvel what injury the Lord Jesus hath done this man, that he should have such indifferent thoughts of coming to God by him? ...|$|R
