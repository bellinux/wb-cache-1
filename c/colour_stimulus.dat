40|$|The perceptual {{correlate}} to hue and {{the stability}} of its representation in the coordinates of Logvinenko's illumination-invariant object-colour atlas (Logvinenko, 2009) are investigated. Logvinenko's object-colour atlas represents the colours of objects in terms of special rectangular reflectance functions defined by 3 -parameters, a (chromatic purity), o (spectral bandwidth) and A. (central wavelength) describing the rectangular reflectance {{to which it is}} metameric. These parameters were shown to be approximate perceptual correlates in terms of chroma, whiteness/blackness, and hue, respectively. When the illumination changes, the mapping of object colours to the rectangular atlas coordinates is subject to a phenomenon referred to as <b>colour</b> <b>stimulus</b> shift. The perceptual correlates shift as well. The problem of co Jour stinmlus shift is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} atlas is based on rectangular functions.

In a five-stage experiment the preference for colour intensity and purity, and the preference for the dominant wavelength were tested by presenting four <b>colour</b> <b>stimuli</b> in each test to freely flying experienced workers of two stingless bee species, Melipona mondury and Melipona quadrifasciata. The results with bee-blue, bee-UV-blue and bee-green colours offered in four combinations of varying colour intensity and purity suggest a complex interaction between these colour traits for the determination of colour choice. Specifically, M. mondury preferred bee-UV-blue colours over bee-green, bee-blue and bee-blue-green colours while M. quadrifasciata preferred bee-green <b>colour</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Moreover in M. mondury the preferences were different if the background colour was changed from grey to green.

This transform is derived based on prior knowledge about the typical <b>colour</b> <b>stimuli</b> the device will encounter. One way to obtain this knowledge is by calibration: a transform is de rived from measurements {{of a set of}} re?ectance functions imaged under a known illuminant. Alternatively, the transform can be derived by making theoretical assumptions about the statistical distribution of <b>colour</b> <b>stimuli.</b> In this paper we propose a correction procedure which is a compromise between these two approaches. We posit that accurate correction is best achieved, by making use of prior knowledge about both surfaces and illuminants. We argue that our prior knowledge of scene illuminants is best modelled by a theoretical approach which only constrains illuminants to be physically realisable, but that accurate knowledge of surface re?ectance can be obtained by calibration. We then show how these two independent models can be combined to form a model of <b>colour</b> <b>stimuli,</b> and from this, an appropriate colour correction transform. Finally, we present an empirical analysis which shows that our compromise solution a?ords very good colour correction and performs slightly better than previous approaches...|$|R

An important feature of this representation is that the set of hue descriptors inherits the illuminate invariant property of Logvinenko’s object colour atlas.

V. ] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] fabrication, in situ spectroelectrochemistry and colour measurement of hybrid electrochromic devices (ECDs) based on a surface-confined metal hexacyanometallate – Prussian blue (PB, containing the iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II) chromophore) – and aqueous solution-phase methyl viologen (N,N´-dimethyl- 4, 4 ´-bipyridylium) are described. In the ECDs, the initial (‘off’) bleached state is set with PB in its reduced form and the methyl viologen as the di-cation. Switching to the coloured state (‘on’), forms the mixed-valence iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II) chromophore on oxidation of iron(II) hexacyanoferrate(II), with simultaneous reduction of the methyl viologen dication to form a mixture of the radical cation monomer/dimer. Using the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) system of colorimetry, the <b>colour</b> <b>stimulus</b> of such ECDs and the changes that take place on reversibly switching between the colourless and coloured states have been calculated from in situ visible region spectra recorded under electrochemical control. The concentration of the solution-phase methyl viologen and its diffusion to the cathode controlled both the proportion of surface-confined (reduced) PB that is switched to the blue form and the overall ECD changes. For the ECDs’ ‘on’ states, the CIELAB 1976 color space coordinates for a D 55 illuminant were L* = 60, a* = 3 and b* = − 46, and L* = 49, a* = 9 and b* = − 59, respectively for 5 and 10 mM methyl viologen solution concentrations. The low a* and high (negative) b* chromaticity coordinates quantified the overall ECD <b>colour</b> <b>stimulus</b> of the ‘on’ state as being deep blue, with a broad absorption across the visible spectral region. Combination of the methyl viologen system in the ECDs served to remove the green tint perceived in single film PB.

40|$|This lecture {{qualification}} thesis investigates relevant {{characteristics of}} the human visual system. These results are used to develop methods to optimize modern visual technologies. Self-luminant displays as well as interior and exterior light sources are considered. For self-luminant displays, calibration and characterization methods are developed to display <b>colour</b> <b>stimuli</b> accurately. New display colour primaries are designed for a large colour gamut. New sub pixel architectures are proposed for an optimum spatial resolution. Modern self-luminant displays often represent large <b>colour</b> <b>stimuli</b> and their <b>colour</b> appearance is modelled. Chromatic afterimages are also modelled to increase the image quality of video sequences. Ergonomic principles are derived to apply colour contrast to enhance visual search performance {{in the presence of}} coloured objects. Cognitive, preferred and emotional colour is also subject of this thesis. Long-term memory colours were found to be important to enhance the perceived colour quality of colour displays. The strength of visually evoked emotions related to cinema motion pictures is computed by a mathematical model based on the technical parameters of the video sequence. The factors of colour image preference (local and global contrast, chroma and hue) are investigated. A new algorithm is shown that enhances the image quality for young and elderly observers separately. To optimize interior light sources, principles to renew the CIE colour rendering index are presented. A concept of a colour harmony rendering index is proposed. An important question of this lecture qualification thesis is the investigation of mesopic visual performance to optimize exterior light sources. To this aim, the processes of mesopic detection are modelled at the detection threshold for different retinal eccentricities. An important finding is the necessity to include the activity of chromatic retinal mechanisms in addition to the achromatic mechanisms of the current models. A new chromatic model (the CHC model) is described. The CHC model does not use the concept of luminance to model mesopic detection at or around the threshold. It models the adaptation of each mechanism of mesopic detection separately and as a function of retinal eccentricity...|$|R

40|$|According to Gibson's (1979) {{theory of}} “affordances”, the {{environment}} is constantly bombarding the viewer with a multitude of possible actions. More recently, {{it has been suggested}} that the simple viewing of an object can automatically elicit motor plans for actions towards this object. Research has attributed this phenomenon to the existence of two different neural pathways for processing visual information from objects and implied a distinction between conscious visual perception (meditated by the ventral stream) and unconscious visuomotor control (sub-served by the dorsal stream). This has proved compelling to many researchers, who have further tried to dissociate conscious visual perception from visually guided performance. In the present study, participants formed precision and power grips in response to a central <b>colour</b> <b>stimulus,</b> in order to determine whether these actions could be modulated by the prior subliminal presentation of pinch/grasp affording prime objects. All prime objects were briefly presented for 20 ms, thus making it impossible for participants to consciously identify these.

The time between the onset of the prime and the appearance of the target was, also, varied in order to assess the time course of any priming effects obtained. The results suggest that affordances for relevant actions can also be extracted from objects whose physical properties are far from obvious, and appear inaccessible to consciousness. Furthermore, we provide evidence of a negative compatibility effect under experimental circumstances that have not been described in the literature before, and which rule out many kinds of interaction at a perceptual level...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Springer Verlag via the DOI in this record. The {{spontaneous}} occurrence of colour preferences without learning has been demonstrated in several insect species; however, the underlying mechanisms are still not understood. Here, we use a comparative approach to investigate spontaneous and learned colour preferences in foraging bees of two tropical and one temperate species. We hypothesised that tropical bees utilise different sets of plants and therefore might differ in their spontaneous colour preferences. We tested colour-naive bees and foragers from colonies that had been enclosed in large flight cages for a long time. Bees were shortly trained with triplets of neutral, UV-grey stimuli placed randomly at eight locations on a black training disk to induce foraging motivation. During unrewarded tests, the bees’ responses to eight colours were video-recorded. Bees explored all colours and displayed an overall preference for colours dominated by long or short wavelengths, rather than a single <b>colour</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Naive Apis cerana and Bombus terrestris showed similar choices. Both inspected long-wavelength stimuli more than short-wavelength stimuli, whilst responses of the tropical stingless bee Tetragonula iridipennis differed, suggesting that resource partitioning could be a determinant of spontaneous colour preferences. Reward on an unsaturated yellow colour shifted the bees’ preference curves as predicted, which is in line with previous findings that brief colour experience overrides the expression of spontaneous preferences. We conclude that rather than determining foraging behaviour in inflexible ways, spontaneous colour preferences vary depending on experimental settings and reflect potential biases in mechanisms of learning and decision-making in pollinating insects.

40|$|AbstractTemporal {{analysis}} of the chromatic flash visual evoked potential (VEP) was studied in human subjects with normal and anomalous colour vision using a deterministic pseudo-random binary stimulus (VERIS). Five experiments were carried out on four normal subjects investigating heterochromatic red–green exchange and single colour/achromatic (either red/grey or green/grey) exchange {{over a wide range}} of luminance ratios for the two stimuli, the effects of lowered mean luminance on the chromatic VEP and the effects of colour desaturation at constant mean luminance and constant luminance contrast. Finally, the performance of three dichromats, a protanope and two deuteranopes, on heterochromatic exchange VEP and on colour desaturation were investigated. In contrast to the chromatic electroretinogram, which shows great symmetry with respect to luminance ratio {{on opposite sides of the}} isoluminant point, the chromatic VEP demonstrated a distinct asymmetry when the colours exchanged included red. On the red side of isoluminance (red more luminant than green), a wave with longer latency and altered waveform became dominant. The effects of green stimulation were indistinguishable from those of achromatic stimulation at the same luminance contrast over the whole range of chromatic contrast and for all levels of desaturation studied. Desaturation of red with constant luminance contrast (desaturated red/grey stimulation) resulted in a systematic alteration in the evoked waveform. Subtraction of the achromatic first- and second-order responses from responses recorded in the red desaturation series resulted in remarkably uniform waveforms, with peak amplitudes growing linearly with saturation. The absence of interaction between achromatic and coloured components for all (including the most intense <b>colour)</b> <b>stimulus</b> parameters used suggests that the generators of these components are separate. Recordings from the dichromats showed that the contrast response minimum shifted from the point of photopic isoluminance to the point of zero cone contrast (at the silent substitution point) for the remaining cone type. The waveforms recorded with a series of luminance ratios were much simpler than those recorded from trichromats and symmetrical with respect to their isoluminant points. Despite the indication of the presence of L cones of apparently normal spectral sensitivity in the deuteranopes (on the basis of flicker photometry), there was no evidence for a red-sensitive component in the desaturation or heterochromatic stimulation series. The results are discussed in terms of the possibility of separate generation of chromatic and achromatic contributions to the VEP...|$|E
40|$|In the 1950 s De Valois and colleagues, {{followed}} by other researchers, discovered spectrally opposed single {{cells in the}} primate LGN. They called them Red-Green and Yellow-Blue opponent colour cells, interpreting them as the biological implementation of Hering's opponent colours theory. By the 1990 s, it became increasingly clear the growing data on such cells did not match Hering's unique hues Red-Green, Yellow-Blue. Yet these cells today remain misleadingly described by opponent-colour or similar various terms, with no agreed best term. This paper reviews much of the data to show spectrally opposed responses in primate retina, LGN, and striate cortex are complementary colours of three types: Blue-Yellow, Red-Cyan, and (less often) Green-Magenta. Such cells may be termed 'complementary colour cells' as a generic category, and further specified by the respective hue pair, e. g. Red-Cyan. (In psychophysics, 'complementary colours' refers {{to a pair of}} <b>colour</b> <b>stimuli</b> that admix white.) The difference between opponent colours and complementary colours is more than semantic: it concerns colour constancy, which in theory is aided by complementary colour cells. 11 page(s...|$|R

Studies of {{neurological}} patients with category-speciWc agnosia have provided important contributions {{to our understanding of}} object recognition, although the meaning of such disorders is still hotly debated. One crucial line of research for our understanding of category eVects, is through the examination of category biases in healthy normal subjects. This approach has, however, led to contradictory Wndings with advantages both for natural kinds and for man-made things being documented in healthy subjects. It has been proposed that task conditions may inXuence the direction of advantage (Gerlach, 2001) and in particular, that sub-optimal viewing conditions underpin natural kinds advantages, while man-made advantages emerge under more optimal viewing conditions. In two experiments with normal subjects, we examined the roles played by spatial resolution (blurring), <b>stimulus</b> type (<b>colour</b> and texture), and speed of presentation in picture naming across category. In both experiments, healthy subjects showed a natural kind advantage for original stimuli and for blurred <b>colour</b> <b>stimuli</b> (at slow and fast presentation speeds), while an advantage for man-made things emerged for line-drawings that were blurred and presented slowly. The implications for category-speciWc object recognition deWcits are discussed...|$|R
