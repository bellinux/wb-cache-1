Copper acetate reacts with dmppH 2 in the presence of either 3, 5 -di-tert-butyl pyrazole (dbpz) or 3, 5 -dimethyl pyrazole (dmpz), leading to the isolation of tetrameric complex [Cu(dmpp) (dbpz) ](4) 1 and hexanuclear cage complex [Cu(6) (PO(4)) (dmpp) (3) (OAc) (3) (dmpz) (9) ] 2, respectively. Whereas compound 1 is a cubane-shaped cluster whose Cu(4) O(12) P(4) core resembles the double- 4 -ring (D 4 R) zeolite SBU, compound 2 is a novel hexanuclear copper complex with an unprecedented structure in metal phosphate chemistry. Use of bulkier dippH(2) in the above reactions, however, yielded metal-free acid-base complexes [(dippH) (dbpz) (dbpzH) ] 3 and [(dippH) (dmpz) (dmpzH) ] 4, respectively. The reactions carried out between copper acetate and dmppH 2 or dippH(2) in the presence of chelating ligand 1, 10 -phenanthroline produced structurally similar dimeric <b>copper</b> <b>phosphates</b> [Cu(phen) (dmpp) (CH(3) OH) ](2) center dot 2 CH(3) OH 5 and [Cu(phen) (dipp) (CH(3) OH) ](2) center dot 2 CH(3) OH 6 with a S 4 R SBU core. Changing the copper source to [Cu(2) (bpy) (2) (OAc) (OH) (H(2) O) ] center dot 2 CIO(4) and carrying out reactions both with dippH(2) and with dmppH(2) result in the formation of trinuclear <b>copper</b> <b>phosphates</b> [Cu(3) (bpy) (3) (dmpp) (2) (CH(3) OH) (3) ] center dot 2 ClO(4) center dot 2 CH(3) OH 7 and [Cu(3) (bpy) (3) (dipp) (2) (CH(3) OH) (3) ] center dot 2 ClO(4) center dot 2 CH(3) OH 8.

3000|$|According to Scott [2], who has {{reviewed}} the older literature, copper phosphates as corrosion products are not common. However, the reported <b>copper</b> <b>phosphate</b> corrosion products are libethenite (Cu 2 (OH)PO 4), cornetite (Cu 3 (PO 4)(OH) 3), sampleite (NaCaCu 5 (PO 4) 4 Cl· 5 H 2 O), hydrated <b>copper</b> <b>phosphate</b> (cupric orthophosphate Cu 3 (PO 4) 2 · 3 H 2 O) and zapatalite (Cu 3 Al 4 (PO 4) 3 (OH) 9 · 3 H 2 O). Among these compounds {{the most frequent}} <b>copper</b> <b>phosphate</b> found as a corrosion product is libethenite (Cu 2 (OH)PO 4) often associated with cremation sites. Recent work has reported both sampleite and libethenite on a Lydian bed of iron, bronze and copper dating to about 505 BC [35], and libethenite was found by Berger on a Nordic bronze dagger from Schoolbek farm, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, dating from the mid- 2 nd millennium BC [36]. Three bronze arrowheads unearthed at Dachengdun site in Anhui province, China all showed libethenite (Cu 2 (OH)PO 4) in the corrosion products [37] while corrosion {{on a pair of}} bronze tweezers wrapped with silk products and buried near a person’s waist in Gansu province, China was found to contain cupric orthophosphate (Cu 3 (PO 4) 2 · 3 H 2 O) [38]. It appears that more frequent analysis of corrosion products on ancient bronzes is revealing more copper phosphates and the present study is in accordance with these findings. According to Mattson [39] and Fabrizi [40], bronzes with <b>copper</b> <b>phosphate</b> corrosion products are rare and less commonly found with copper chloride products which form in an acid environment. The analysis results of the three swords in this paper is in line with their conclusion. The two pH values obtained from Lijiaba site are close to neutral and slightly alkaline while soil from Birka where <b>copper</b> <b>phosphate</b> corrosion products also occur [39] shows a pH of about 8. This is consistent with a pH control on the formation of phosphate corrosion products. Libethenite has been produced experimentally through the reaction 2 Cu^ 2 + [...] + HPO_ 4 ^ 2 - [...] + 2 OH^ - →Cu_ 2 PO_ 4 OH + H_ 2 O at pH 7 [41]. Hence the presence of libethenite on the swords from Lijiaba may reflect the pH of the burial environment.|$|E
40|$|<b>Copper</b> <b>phosphate</b> {{glasses with}} 40, 50 and 60 mole% CuO are melted in air at 1000 °C, 1 l 00 °C and 1200 °C using quartz or alumina crucibles, and the [Cu²⁺]/[CU(total) ] ratio {{variations}} with melting time are measured. Glasses are oxidized during melting and reach equilibrium [Cu²⁺] / [CU(total) ] ratios which {{are independent of}} melting temperature and identical for the 40 and 50 mole% CuO content glasses. Structural considerations rather than a conventional redox reaction seem to determine oxidation-reduction equilibrium of the glass. Thus, the [Cu²⁺] / [CU(total) ] ratio in <b>copper</b> <b>phosphate</b> glass can be controlled by changing melting time. In this work, crystallization, optical absorptions, chemical durability, and structure of <b>copper</b> <b>phosphate</b> glass have been investigated depending on the [Cu²⁺] / [CU(total) ] ratio in the glass as well as glass composition The crystallization of copper meta phosphate is initiated from the surface and its main crystalline phase is copper metaphosphate (Cu(P 0 ₃) ₂), independent of the [Cu²⁺]/[CU(total) ] ratio in the glass. However, the crystal morphology, the relative crystallization rates and their temperature dependences {{are affected by the}} [Cu²⁺]/[CU(total) ] ratio in the glass. The glass transition temperature of the glass increases as the [Cu²⁺] / [CU(total) ] ratio is raised. The optical energy gap, E(opt), increases as CuO content and the [Cu²⁺]/[CU(total) ] ratio in thE glass are raised. This trend is explained by speculating upon the energy band structure of <b>copper</b> <b>phosphate</b> glass. However, the Urbach energy, ΔE, is affected solely by the [Cu²⁺]/[CU(total) ] ratio in the glass. The absorption band of Cu¹⁺ occurs {{in the vicinity of the}} absorption tail and is responsible for the increase of ΔE with reducing the [Cu²⁺]/[CU(total) ] ratio in the glass. A broad and asymmetric absorption band centered at about 11000 cm⁻¹ is resolved into three component Gaussian absorption bands around 8500 cm⁻¹, 12000 cm⁻¹ and 13250 cm⁻¹. Each of these component absorption bands is assigned to an energy transition between the energy levels in a tetragonally distorted octahedral coordination. The position of the minimum absorption shifts to higher wavenumbers with increasing the [Cu²⁺]/[CU(total) ] ratio in the glass regardless of glass composition and is responsible for color changes in the glass. The 55 mole% CuO glass dissolves more readily than either the 40 or 50 mole% CuO glass. As the [Cu²⁺]/[CU(total) ] ratio in the glass decreases, the chemical durability improves. Also, the solution pH dependence of the dissolution rate in the oxidized and reduced glasses is found to differ.

The focus of the study was the effect of phosphorous on the different reactions occurring on the SCR catalyst, including ammonia oxidation, NO oxidation and standard SCR using monolith catalysts.

In addition, we observed that phosphorus severely suppressed ammonia oxidation and NO oxidation, while its impact on standard SCR reaction was nearly negligible below 300 degrees C.
