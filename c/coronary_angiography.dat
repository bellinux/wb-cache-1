40|$|<b>Coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> {{is widely}} {{recognised}} as a reliable imaging modality for {{the diagnosis of}} coronary artery disease. <b>Coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> not only provides excellent visualisation of anatomical changes in the coronary artery with high diagnostic value in the detection of lumen stenosis or occlusion, but also offers quantitative characterisation of coronary plaque components. Furthermore, <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> allows myocardial perfusion imaging with diagnostic value comparable to the reference standard method.

40|$|Coronary {{computed}} tomography is a non-invasive diagnostic test which recently underwent a remarkable development. Especially {{in patients with}} low-to-intermediate pretest probability this test {{is characterized by a}} high diagnostic accuracy as compared with cardiac catheterization as the diagnostic gold standard. Aim of this work was the critical discussion of the clinical impact of non-invasive coronary CT from different perspectives. The following key points summarize our recent research/work in this context: An individual CT planning based on a native low-dose scan (low dose calcium scoring; CACS) may reduce the radiation exposure of 320 row CT compared with conventional/standardized CT protocols without integrated CACS. Especially patients with a high heart rate of more than 65 bpm benefit from undergoing CACS before subsequent <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography.</b> Non-invasive <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> with 320 row CT is especially suited to rule-out significant coronary artery disease in patients with atypical angina due to its high negative predictive value. <b>Coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> may reduce the radiation exposure and amount of needed contrast agent compared with the diagnostic gold standard. Using <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> in patients with low-to-intermediate pretest probability may significantly reduce the number of diagnostic cardiac catheterizations without subsequent coronary intervention or stent implantation. In addition, <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> may reduce the occurrence of minor complications, long-time events, as well as the time of in-hospital-stay and general health care costs. <b>Coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> has become clinical routine for analyzing the coronary arteries and excluding significant coronary artery disease which is demonstrated by an increasing number of performed CT scans worldwide. Despite the high variation of different CT scanner which may be used for performing <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> there is a common standard established regarding decisions about the clinical indication, scan procedure and analyzing/reading coronary CTs. In the context of a 2 -days long hands-on workshop of performing cardiac CT we were able to demonstrate a significant improvement of theoretic skills and practical abilities despite the relatively short time (2 days). Patient acceptance of non-invasive <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> is very high compared with cardiac catheterization as the diagnostic gold standard for excluding coronary artery disease. If patients were able to choose between invasive and non-invasive diagnostic testing, significantly more patients would prefer <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> as compared with cardiac catheterization...|$|R

25|$|Other more {{invasive}} means {{can also}} be used. A cannula or catheter inserted into an artery {{may be used to}} measure pulse pressure or pulmonary wedge pressures. Angiography, which involves injecting a dye into an artery to visualise an arterial tree, can be used in the heart (<b>coronary</b> <b>angiography)</b> or brain. At {{the same time as the}} arteries are visualised, blockages or narrowings may be fixed through the insertion of stents, and active bleeds may be managed by the insertion of coils. An MRI may be used to image arteries, called an MRI angiogram. For evaluation of the blood supply to the lungs a CT pulmonary angiogram may be used.|$|E
500|$|Most MIs occur due to {{coronary}} artery disease.

[...] A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood tests, and <b>coronary</b> <b>angiography.</b> An ECG, which is a recording of the heart's electrical activity, may confirm an ST elevation MI (STEMI) if ST elevation is present.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography for therapeutic decision making in patients with high likelihood of coronary artery disease (CAD) -specifically the ability of <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> to help differentiate patients without and patients with a need for revascularization and determine the appropriate revascularization procedure. Materials and Methods: The study protocol was approved by institutional review board, with written informed consent from all patients. The {{study was conducted in}} compliance with HIPAA. One hundred eighty-five consecutive symptomatic patients (121 men; mean age, 59. 4 years +/- 9. 7) with a positive single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion study underwent <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> and conventional cardiac angiography (hereafter, cardiac catheterization). The management strategy (conservative treatment vs revascularization) and revascularization procedure (percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] vs coronary artery bypass graft surgery [CABG]) were prospectively {{selected on the basis of}} a combination of <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> and SPECT. In addition, the authors calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> in the detection of obstructive CAD and the selection of a revascularization strategy. Cardiac catheterization was used as the standard of reference. Results: Of the 185 patients, 113 (61 %) did not undergo revascularization and 42 (23 %) were free of CAD. In 178 patients (96 %), the same therapeutic strategy (conservative treatment vs revascularization) was chosen on the basis of <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> and catheterization. All patients in need of revascularization were identified with <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography.</b> When revascularization was indicated, the same procedure (PCI vs CABG) was chosen in 66 of 72 patients (92 %). Conclusion: In patients with high likelihood of CAD, the performance of <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> in the differentiation of patients without and patients with a need for revascularization and the selection of a revascularization strategy was similar to that of cardiac catheterization; accordingly, <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> has the potential to limit the number of patients without obstructive CAD who undergo cardiac catheterization and to inform decision making regarding revascularization...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the clinical applications of <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> {{in patients with}} suspected coronary artery disease and identify factors that affect CT findings. Methods: Medical records of patients suspected of coronary artery disease {{over a period of}} 12 months from a tertiary teaching hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Patient age, sex (male/female), duration of symptoms and abnormal rates of <b>coronary</b> CT <b>angiography</b> scans were analysed to {{investigate the}} relationship among these parameters. The patients by age were characterized into five groups: under 36 years, 36 – 45 years, 46 – 55 years, 56 – 65 years and more than 66 years, respectively; while the duration of symptoms was also classified into five groups: less than one week, one week to one month, one to three months, three to six months and more than six months. Results: Of the 880 patient records reviewed, 800 met the above study criteria. Five hundred and forty nine patients demonstrated abnormal CT findings (68. 6 %). There {{was no significant difference in}} the percentage of abnormal CT findings based on patient sex and the duration of symptoms (P = 0. 14).

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) imaging is {{an established}} modality for {{the diagnosis of}} cardiovascular diseases. While functional assessment of the hemodynamical relevance of coronary artery disease using pharmacological stress MR testing has already been successfully integrated into clinical routine, direct coronary MR angiographic techniques are mainly used {{in the context of}} clinical studies. Widespread use of <b>coronary</b> MR <b>angiography</b> in unselected patient populations is mainly hampered by a limited capability to achieve a consistently high diagnostic image quality.
