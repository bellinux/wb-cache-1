The Semantic Web is a {{promising}} step toward improving virtual <b>community</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> It gives <b>information</b> a clearer meaning, better enabling computers and people to cooperate. However, still lacking {{is the purpose}} of the information: how {{is it going to be}} used and evolve? In a Pragmatic Web, the context of the information would be defined as well, as the community examines goal-based conditional inferences in its work in progress. Scientific collaboratories could benefit substantially from such an approach. The PORT collaboratory was established to provide a model for pragmatic collaboratory evolution. In this paper, we outline a pragmatic <b>community</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> development process by combining PORT with the Conceptual Graphs-based RENISYS method for the legitimate user-driven specification of <b>community</b> <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Peircean pragmatism provides a self-critical approach for tool selection in virtual communities. ...|$|R

There have been several projects where university students help implement GIS in neighborhoods and communities. It is believed that access to information is the doorway to more effective government for everybody and community empowerment. In a case study of a group in Milwaukee, residents of an inner city neighborhood became active participants in building a <b>community</b> <b>information</b> <b>system,</b> learning to access public information and create and analyze new databases derived from their own surveys, all with the purpose of making these residents useful actors in city management and in the formation of public policy.
