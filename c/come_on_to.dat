5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

JR confronts Babe, but when she claims that Jamie had <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> her, JR cuts Jamie out of his life. When Babe discovers {{that she is}} nine weeks into her pregnancy, it eliminates the possibility of Jamie being the father.|$|E
25|$|The {{railways}} had regained {{control of}} their own finances in August 1921 and were again dependent on their own resources. However, a large number of former military lorries had <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the second hand market and, with no system of licensing in place, anyone who wished could set up as a common carrier. In August 1921, James Cowie, the NCC's manager, estimated that 50 000 tons of goods traffic was being lost annually.|$|E

Apart from the leak and damaged cargo the Arahua was unaffected. Some of the mail, especially those for Napier were damaged along with the sugar and a large quantity of {{the balance of the}} cargo. Because of the leak all passengers and cargo were offloaded at Gisborne and the ship sailed back to Auckland for repair on the Tuesday.|$|E
25|$|The A-10 engines were {{initially}} susceptible to flameout when subjected to gases {{generated in the}} firing of the gun. When the GAU-8 is being fired, {{the smoke from the}} gun can make the engines stop, and this did occur during initial flight testing. Gun exhaust is essentially oxygen-free, and is certainly capable of causing flameouts of gas turbines. The A-10 engines now have a self-sustaining combustion section. When the gun is fired the igniters <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> reduce the possibility of a flameout.|$|E
25|$|Owais Shah {{made a good}} {{attempt at}} getting the highest strike-rate of {{the opening day of}} Twenty20 cricket, {{recording}} 72 runs off only 30 balls to lift Middlesex Crusaders to an unassailable 210 for 6. For Hampshire Hawks, Shane Warne showed somewhat poor captaincy when Zimbabwean all-rounder Sean Ervine was the eighth man to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> bowl – and then took two for 13 from two overs. New Zealander Craig McMillan, meanwhile, conceded twenty-eight runs from his only over. Despite Nic Pothas scoring 59 off 39 balls, the Hawks were nowhere near keeping up with the required pace, and Middlesex bowler Irfan Pathan was a main cause of that – he took three for 16 from four overs, as Hampshire finished on 192 for 7.|$|E

500|$|White Zombie {{was filmed}} in eleven days in March 1932 and {{was shot at}} the Universal Studios lot and Bronson Canyon on such a small budget {{that it had to}} film at night. Other than Béla Lugosi and Joseph Cawthorn, the {{majority}} of the cast in White Zombie were actors whose fame had diminished since the silent film era. By the time Lugosi appeared in White Zombie, he was already popular with contemporary audiences after his starring role in the hit 1931 film, Dracula. Sources vary about Lugosi's salary for White Zombie. Claims range between US$500 to $900. Richard Sheffield, who was his close friend in the 1950s, reported a payment of $5,000 for White Zombie on Lugosi's tax returns. The cast and crew's reaction to Lugosi on the set was mixed. Madge Bellamy recalled her collaboration with Lugosi positively, stating that he was very pleasant and that he used to kiss her hand in the morning when they would <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> the set. In contrast, assistant cameraman Enzo Martinelli remarked that [...] "Lugosi wasn't really a friendly type" [...] on set.|$|E
500|$|Brian, {{walking in}} drunk, notices that Stewie has resumed {{watching}} Jolly Farm Revue, after previously swearing off {{the show in}} [...] "Road to Europe". Remembering a story {{he had seen in}} the local newspaper, Brian tells Stewie about upcoming auditions for an American version of the show. Jumping at the opportunity, the two show up to the auditions, but quickly learn {{that there is only one}} female role remaining. Determined to win a spot on the show, Stewie decides to cross-dress as a woman, naming his new identity [...] "Karina Smirnoff". Beginning his audition, he starts by telling a completely fabricated story. Convincing the producers that he is telling a true tale, he wins the role. The next morning, on the first day of filming, Stewie as Karina introduces himself to the rest of the cast, and quickly falls in love with a female co-star named Julie. Another co-star, Randall, objects to the new role that Karina was cast to play, and takes Julie away from him to prevent their friendship. As they continue shooting, however, the two develop a friendly relationship, eventually deciding to hold a sleepover, where they become even closer. The next day, Julie professes her love for Karina by wishing that she was actually a boy, causing Stewie, as Karina, to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> her. Julie insists that she is not a lesbian, so Stewie decides to unveil his true identity to the entire cast during a live taping of the show. Shocked that Karina was actually a boy, Julie's mother refuses to let her speak to him, with Stewie left to regret his decision to come out as a cross-dresser, and decides to go get ice cream with Brian, as he can no longer wear that dress.|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Sondheim detested his mother, who {{was said}} to be psychologically abusive and {{projected}} her anger from her failed marriage on her son: [...] "When my father left her, she substituted me for him. And she used me the way she used him, to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> and to berate, beat up on, you see. What she did for five years was treat me like dirt, but <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> me at the same time." [...] She once wrote him a letter saying that the [...] "only regret [...] ever had was giving him birth." [...] When his mother died in the spring of 1992, Sondheim did not attend her funeral.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1970s, he {{attracted}} former big-name Hollywood stars, such as Orson Welles, James Stewart, John Wayne, Mickey Rooney, David Niven, Gene Kelly, James Cagney and Robert Mitchum, not on {{the basis}} that they had a film to promote, but simply because they wanted a chat. Despite this, Parkinson has since asserted that then as now, [...] "...there was just as much plugging in the seventies as at any time later. To suggest otherwise is to misunderstand the reason people <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> talk shows." [...] In particular, he cites Bette Davis as being the guest who [...] "more than anyone, made it clear she was there to plug a product, not because she was, or ever would be, your buddy." ...|$|E

So there's leakage of Paul's guitar and voice on the string tracks.|$|R
2500|$|After graduating, Baird {{served as}} an {{assistant}} football coach at Michigan from 1897 to 1898, including the 1898 Michigan team that won the school's first Western Conference championship. At {{the end of the}} 1898 season, the Chicago Inter-Ocean singled out Baird for his work in coaching the Michigan team:"They had been a disorganized team three weeks before, but Jimmy Baird had <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> maneuver the backs, stop the fumbling, and put snap and life into the team. As a coach, he has been a wonderful success. No one who knows his record as a captain can doubt that he is a worker of miracles to whose power Michigan's wonderful improvement is due. He was continually working over his men or defensive play, when he played the game himself, slapping them on the back, cheering up one, and swearing at another, until Michigan's team became a power and a terror. This year he left his business to rush back at the last moment to lick the team into shape for a victory." ...|$|E
