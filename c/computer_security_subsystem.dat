40|$|M. Sc. (Informatics) Information is power. Any {{organization}} must {{secure and}} protect its entire information assets. Management {{is responsible for}} the well-being of the organization and consequently for <b>computer</b> <b>security.</b> Management must become and stay involved with the <b>computer</b> <b>security</b> situation of the organization, because the existence of any organization depends on an effective information system. One way in which management can stay continually involved and committed with the <b>computer</b> <b>security</b> situation of the organization, is by -, the periodic evaluation of <b>computer</b> <b>security.</b> The results from this evaluation process can initiate appropriate actions to increase <b>computer</b> <b>security</b> in areas needed. For effective management involvement, a tool is needed to aid management in monitoring the status of implementing <b>computer</b> <b>security</b> on a regular basis. The main objective of this dissertation is to develop such a management tool. Basically the thesis consists of three parts, namely framework for effective <b>computer</b> <b>security</b> evaluation, the definition of the criteria {{to be included in the}} tool and lastly, the tool itself. The framework (chapters 1 to 6) defines the basis on which the tool (chapters 7 to 9) is built, e. g. that <b>computer</b> <b>security</b> controls need to be cost-effective and should aid the organization in accomplishing its objectives. The framework is based on a two dimensional graph: firstly, tho various risk areas in which <b>computer</b> <b>security</b> should be applied and secondly, the severity of controls in each of these areas. The tool identifies numerous risk areas critical to the <b>security</b> of the <b>computer</b> and its environment. Each of these risk areas need to be evaluated to find out how well it is secured. From these results an overall <b>computer</b> <b>security</b> situation is pictured. The tool is presented as a spreadsheet, containing a number of questions. The built -in formulae in the spreadsheet perform calculations resulting in an appreciation of the <b>computer</b> <b>security</b> situation. The results of the security evaluation can be used by management to take appropriate actions regarding the <b>computer</b> <b>security</b> situation...|$|R
