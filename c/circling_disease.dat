In household surveys and focus groups, <b>circling</b> <b>disease</b> was more commonly {{described as a}} priority concern in Pawaga, the northern division of the study area, than in Idodi (P[*]<[*] 0.001). In Pawaga, 77 % of households identified <b>circling</b> <b>disease</b> {{as a threat to}} their herds and livelihoods, while only 12 % of households in Idodi were concerned about the impact of <b>circling</b> <b>disease.</b> Even with the small sample of households, spatial analyses identified a significant geographic cluster of households reporting <b>circling</b> <b>disease</b> as a critical concern for livestock health in Pawaga (P[*]<[*] 0.001, Figure  3). The spatial differences in the <b>circling</b> <b>disease</b> concerns were also reflected in extension officer responses.

At the household level, {{the percentage of the}} herd affected by disease ranged from less than 1 % to over 30 % of animals. The most prevalent health problems reported were respiratory and neurologic conditions, both of which affected livestock in almost 40 % of households. While CBPP and CCPP are common in the study area, cases of respiratory disease may also be due to other causes such as bovine tuberculosis. The neurologic condition, kizunguzungu or ‘circling disease’, was described as a circling behaviour followed by rapid deterioration and death in goats or sheep. In preliminary investigations of the affected livestock, clinical signs and brain lesions were consistent with symptoms caused by cysts of the developing larval stage of a tapeworm (Taenia multiceps) shed by domestic dogs and wild canids. <b>Circling</b> <b>disease</b> is a growing concern among pastoralists in the study area due to high mortality in sick animals. Pastoralists in all focus groups also included respiratory disease and <b>circling</b> <b>disease</b> among the most threatening diseases to their livelihoods.|$|E

Maasai and Sukuma preferences were similar, with both ethnic groups ranking increased availability of medicines {{in the villages}} first, pastoralist education second, and extension officer education third. The Barabaig placed less emphasis on education (P[*]=[*] 0.02), ranking cattle dips, medicines in the villages, and research above extension officer and pastoralist education. However, during pastoralist focus groups, participants from all three tribes {{emphasized the importance of}} education on livestock health topics including identifying clinical signs of disease and understanding appropriate disease treatment and prevention. While knowledge of emerging diseases (such as <b>circling</b> <b>disease)</b> was considered important for all pastoralists, one participant emphasized the need for ongoing education about common existing diseases, such as parasitic infections, to help transfer knowledge to younger members of the households. Pastoralists from all tribes echoed the desire for education to be extended to all members of the household. Both female and male pastoralists stressed that it was necessary that women have access to livestock health education. In all groups, disease was discussed as a critical factor limiting livestock production, and livestock health education was confirmed as a priority for increasing herd health and resilience.|$|E

The {{study carried out on}} 80 households to collect livestock health problems in market oriented livestock development, livestock production system and associated information by giving emphasis on livestock health. All livestock owned by households were study animals. Four PAs were selected from a total of 49 PAs purposively. Households (N= 80) were randomly selected and interviewed from the four PAs 20 from each. Group discussion and observational studies were also conducted. 10 - 12 key respondents were selected for each PAs by the respective DAs and discussed for one hour. Clinical observation also made from November, 2006 to March, 2007. The production system was found to be mixed type with main livestock of cattle and goats. Most of the respondents were found to be non-educated. Health problems were mentioned and ranked by the respondents. The percentages of diseases were calculated based on the respondent frequency.

States with a higher proportion of multidimensional poor also have lower access to improved drinking water, sanitation and cooking fuel. Focusing on states with a high prevalence of multidimensional poverty could help reduce household environmental deprivation of improved water, sanitation and cooking fuel. Poor sanitation is also associated with a vicious <b>circle</b> of <b>disease</b> and linked to poverty and ignorance. It may be mentioned that improving sanitation has been accorded high priority in policy initiatives. The Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) conducted in rural areas from 1999 to 2012 was not very successful. Evaluation of the TSC suggests that the success of the program in selected districts was due to a comprehensive approach of demand creation for sanitation, development of technological solutions tailored to consumer preference and focusing on changing behaviour (World Bank, Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) 2013). The Swasth Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India, Healthy India), initiated in 2014, aimed at eliminating open defecation, eradicating manual scavenging and generating awareness among citizens about sanitation and its linkages with public health. Intervention studies also showed modest reduction in open defecation owing to the TSC (Patil et al. 2014). Studies also suggest that a significant proportion of rural population revealed preference for open defecation even with access to toilets (Gupta et al. 2014). Creating public awareness to use toilet facility and increased monetary incentive to build toilets are suggested. This could be achieved by strong political will involving central, state and local governments and by involving the electronic and the print media.|$|R

40|$|Vasopressin is an {{important}} hormone for water regulation of the body. When dehydration occurs, vasopressin secretion leads to water reabsorption in the kidney to prevent water loss. However, vasopressin seems to have deleterious effects on the kidney as well. In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), vasopressin increases cyst growth and disease progression. Detrimental effects of vasopressin on chronic kidney disease in general {{have been described as}} well. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, copeptin was validated as marker for vasopressin because vasopressin is difficult to measure. Copeptin was stable outside the body, easy to measure and was a reliable marker for vasopressin in patients with impaired kidney function. In the second part of this thesis vasopressin release during thirsting was investigated in ADPKD and IgA nephropathy patients. Already in an early stage of disease, ADPKD patients had an impaired urine concentrating capacity which lead to an increase in vasopressin. IgA nephropathy patients had an impaired concentrating capacity as well although less profound in comparison to ADPKD patients. Vasopressin levels were increased in IgA nephropathy patients as well. The following hypothesis was formulated: when kidney function deteriorates, urine concentrating capacity decreases leading to an increase in vasopressin.

T 1 D is something of an orphan disease, currently managed by endocrinologists yet dependent upon the wit of immunologists, both basic and clinical, to find the best approaches to prevention and cure. Type 1 diabetes thus represents one of the most active arenas for translational research, as novel immune-based interventions find their way to the clinic. The first serious attempt at immune-based treatment for T 1 D was in 1984, the first at prevention in 1993; current and planned trials will take us into the next decade before reporting their results. This paper represents the first attempt at a comprehensive review of this quarter century of endeavour, documenting all the strategies that have emerged into clinical studies. Importantly, the intense clinical activity has established robust infrastructures for future T 1 D trials and frameworks for their design. The evident success of the monoclonal anti-CD 3 antibody trials in established T 1 D demonstrate that modulation of islet autoimmunity in humans after the onset of overt disease can be achieved, and give some reason to be cautiously optimistic for the ability of these and other agents, alone and in combination, to provide an effective immunotherapy for the disease...|$|R

40|$|Malaria is {{the most}} {{important}} parasitic infection in humans, causing an estimated one million deaths annually. Most cases occur in young children in sub-Saharan Africa, supporting the vicious <b>circle</b> of <b>disease</b> and poverty. Current control strategies have so far failed to reduce the disease in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITN) are effective in preventing malaria episodes and efficacious drugs (such as artemisinin-based combination therapies or ACTs) exist to cure malaria. However, a major problem is the delivery of quality health services, including life-saving drugs, to the ones in need. A variety of inter-linked factors influences patients’ access to prompt and effective treatment. While growing resistance against commonly used antimalarials such as chloroquine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is being addressed with the introduction of ACTs, obstacles to effective malaria treatment have been identified at the levels of the households (the demand side), the health system (the supply side), and in health policy. The present thesis aimed at contributing {{to a better understanding of}} factors influencing access to malaria treatment in a positive or a negative way. The insights gained should inform the development of targeted interventions to improve access to malaria treatment and help to develop a general access framework. The research was carried out as part of the ACCESS Programme, which aims to understand and improve access to effective malaria treatment in the districts of Kilombero and Ulanga, in south-eastern Tanzania. The ACCESS strategy is based on a set of integrated interventions, including (1) social marketing for improved care seeking at community level, (2) strengthening the quality of case-management in health facilities, and (3) strengthening the commercial drug retail sector. The interventions are accompanied by a comprehensive set of monitoring and evaluation activities. Quantitative, semi-quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data collection in the area of the local Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) and the nearby semi-urban centre of Ifakara. Between 2004 and 2006, community-based surveys were conducted to investigate treatment-seeking behaviour and estimate communityeffectiveness of malaria treatment. A shop census and mystery shoppers (simulated clients) were used to monitor drug availability and the performance of shopkeepers in the retail sector. The DSS served as sampling frame for the community-based studies and provided demographic indicators, including morbidity and mortality data. The investigation of treatment-seeking and illness perception revealed a better overlap of local and biomedical illness concepts than reported in earlier studies from the same area. This is likely to reflect the intensive social marketing and health education campaigns carried out during the past decade. Modern medicine was clearly preferred by most patients and 87. 5...|$|R
30|$|According to the author, the {{selfishness}} of today’s {{lifestyle in}} western welfare countries, which is strongly oriented towards {{the principle of}} individual autonomy, is not compliant with human nature, which instead requires a dedicated integration of mankind in his surrounding world. One basic need of human beings consists in the accomplishment of a balanced equilibrium between the individual selfhood (Selbstsein)—distinctly marked by the individual’s own world—and perceiving itself as an integrating component of the universal world (togetherness = Mitsein; notion originated by Heidegger and adopted by O. Schwemmer). Furthermore, Meyer-Abich argues that almost any disease is man-self-made, that is: today’s diseases are induced by individual misbehaviour and a disease propagating environment because of the disequilibrium between man and his surrounding nature. This approach holds convincing elements especially {{in regard to the}} knowledge about the multifactorial occurrence of leading diseases in occidental cultural <b>circles.</b> Notably, <b>diseases</b> of the cardiovascular system, diabetes type II, certain defined types of cancer, chronic back pain or the considerable increase in depressive disorders are triggered by individual predisposition and environmental influences. Although many of the underlying causal relations of diseases have been perceived long since, however, the claim of generalization of this conjunction to all diseases appears to be elusive. The book accentuates the importance of explanation to patients about the meaningfulness of ailments (Sinnhorizont von Krankheit). In some parts, the author propagates even a strong medical paternalism: The aim is not merely to educate the individual to preserve his/her health condition, but moreover to unveil presumable disease propagating specific behaviours and to insist on counter measure lifestyle-attitudes for the individual. Moreover, the quest for the possibility of virtually eliminating the burden of disease for mankind by adopting over sound provisions occurs as highly controversial and scarcely accessible to reason. Although clearly opposed to the author’s psychosomatic approach, parallels to futuristic visions shared by scientists who believe imperturbably in scientific progress applicable for the eradication of human suffering come to mind, whereas the replicability of the insight that today’s medicine—as applied science—is primarily disease focussed (Krankheitsmedizin) and, therefore, it is not taking into view the preservation and care of health as primarily orientation but rather the reconstitution of health, meets current issues {{for the development of a}} sound-based medical care system. However, the consideration of medical prophylaxis as basic objective of the health care system strikes as a very ambitious goal, as it implicitly demands the promotion and prescription for the individual of the proper conduct of life.|$|R

Formalin was squirted into the circulation of consumptives until it was discovered that formalin nourishes the tubercle bacillus handsomely and kills men. The popular theory of disease is the common medical theory: namely, that every disease had its microbe duly created in the garden of Eden, and has been steadily propagating itself and producing widening <b>circles</b> of malignant <b>disease</b> ever since. It was plain from the first that if this had been even approximately true, the whole human race would have been wiped out by the plague long ago, and that every epidemic, instead of fading out as mysteriously as it rushed in, would spread over the whole world. It was also evident that the characteristic microbe of a disease might be a symptom instead of a cause. An unpunctual man is always in a hurry; but it does not follow that hurry is the cause of unpunctuality: on the contrary, what is the matter with the patient is sloth. When Florence Nightingale said bluntly that if you overcrowded your soldiers in dirty quarters there would be an outbreak of smallpox among them, she was snubbed as an ignorant female who did not know that smallpox can be produced only by the importation of its specific microbe.|$|R
40|$|AIM: Imo State of Nigeria was an {{endemic area}} for paragonimiasis from 1964 to 1980. A well planned {{eradication}} program {{was put in}} place and no case was recorded from 1980 to 2007. In October 2007 the first patient with the disease voluntarily reported at the base hospital at 21 A Park Road, Aba Nigeria. This case calls to mind a possible re-emergence of the disease&# 8211;hence this report to alert health stakeholders to initiate and sustain disease eradication program that will give everlasting solution to this disease problem. METHOD: A healthy looking man reported with chronic cough and haemoptysis at the hospital. Ziehl-Neelsen sputum test was done daily for 3 days for acid-fast bacilli. Direct sputum smear microscopy for eggs of paragonimiasis was done. Blood was examined for differential white blood count and direct X-ray chest films were examined also. RESULTS: Sputum was negative for acid-fast mycobacterium organisms. Sputum showed eggs of P. uterobilateralis. Eosinophil count was 15 % of the total white blood count. Chest X-ray film showed abnormal soft shadows in one area of the upper left lung field. The patient was diagnosed to have paragonimiasis. CONCLUSION: Eradication program put in place in the endemic paragonimiasis area of Imo State of Nigeria broke the <b>circle</b> of the <b>disease</b> transmission. When the program implementation was relaxed or non-existent the circle closed&# 8211;hence the re-emergence. It is wise to report this case hoping that the stakeholders will restart the programme continues and sustain it to ensure lasting eradication. This re-emergence could occur anywhere in the world with similar disease transmitting conditions. A lesson learnt here would be of immense benefit to readers especially to health workers.

40|$|Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic {{antibody}} (ANCA) -associated vasculitis (AAV) {{constitute a}} group of vasculitides characterized by neutrophil-rich necrotizing inflammation of small vessels {{and the presence of}} ANCA in the circulation. Dying neutrophils surrounding the walls of small vessels are a histological hallmark of AAV. Traditionally it has been assumed that these neutrophils die by necrosis, but neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have recently been visualized at the sites of vasculitic lesions. NETs were first described to be involved in capture and elimination of pathogens but dysregulated production and/or clearance of NETs are thought to contribute to vessel inflammation in AAV; directly by damaging endothelial cells and indirectly by acting as a link between the innate and adaptive immune system through the generation of pathogenic PR 3 -ANCA and MPO-ANCA that can activate neutrophils. ANCA can, however, be found in all individuals and are therefore suggested to belong to the repertoire of natural antibodies produced by innate-like B cells, implying that not all ANCA are pathogenic.   In paper I, we found neutrophils in patients to be more prone to undergo NETosis/necrosis spontaneously compared with neutrophils in healthy controls (HC), as well as that active patients possessed elevated levels of NETs in the circulation. Our results also suggest that ANCA during remission could contribute to the clearance of NETs as we observed an inverse relation between ANCA and NETs. In paper II, we observed neutrophils in patients to be more easily activated upon ANCA stimulation as they produced more ROS than neutrophils in HC. In paper III, we showed {{for the first time that}} cells of adaptive immunity (B and T cells) in addition to cells of innate immunity can release ET-like structures, in this case consisting of mitochondrial (mt) DNA. mtDNA can act as a damage-associated pattern molecule (DAMP) and promote inflammation, and increased levels of mtDNA has been observed in AAV. Our finding broadens our perspective of the possible roles of T and B cells in immunological responses, and should be further investigated in AAV. In paper IV, we observed reduced frequencies of MZ-like B cells, considered to be innate-like B cells that produce natural antibodies, and of the proposed regulatory B (Breg) cell populations CD 24 highCD 27 + and CD 25 +CD 27 + B cells in patients, particularly in those with active disease. We also observed the phenotypes of these different Breg cell populations to be different from the corresponding cells in HC. We hypothesize that the increased activation potential by neutrophils in AAV to produce ROS and undergo NETosis/necrosis contribute to the excessive inflammation as well as an increased antigen load of PR 3 and MPO, and that this in combination with dysregulation of innate-like B cells and Breg cells could lead to break of tolerance to these antigens and production of pathogenic autoantibodies.

Climate {{change is a}}s unpredictable as the movement of a bird in the sky that even an ornithologist cannot predict the movement of a falcon that is swinging in the air and so is the case of climate change even for meteorologists working in the World Meteorological Station. The main concern about climate change and food security is that changing climatic conditions can initiate a vicious <b>circle</b> where infectious <b>diseases</b> cause or compound hunger, which, in turn, make the affected populations more susceptible to infectious disease. The result can be a substantial decline in labor productivity and an increase in poverty and even mortality. Essentially all manifestations of climate change, such as drought, higher temperatures, or heavy rainfalls could {{have an impact on the}} disease pressure on plants and animals. Also, climate change could affect food safety and food security. It is anticipated that due to climate change many flora and fauna including humans, higher plants and animals will face new diseases due to easily expansion of diseases causing epidemic cycle making more favorable to pathogens in different parts of the world. There will be a continuous outbreak of such diseases making hunger and malnutrition more severe than ever and consequently affect for important food commodities due to changing climate of tropical, temperate and equatorial zones, the main biodiversity zones for population and food production as well. Hence, this paper tries to provide a brief review on climate change with respect to food security and crop production, which, ultimately, could suggest agronomic measures to mitigate the impacts of climate change and adopt vagaries of climate change in the days ahead for an agrarian country like Nepal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Bachelor´s thesis "A Sudden {{cardiac death}} - and its social {{impact on the}} family" deals with a sudden cardiac death and its {{influence}} on functionality of a basic element of the state ? the family. The main task of this thesis is to determine a total psychosocial impact of a sudden cardiac death on the relationships {{in the family and}} verify which psychosocial rehabilitation options are offered to the bereaved persons. The expected application of this thesis in practice should improve living conditions for the bereaved persons and to provide them with more information about this diagnosis. In the theoretical part the diagnosis of a sudden cardiac death was described in detail. The death that occurs within one hour after the first signs is a frequently discussed topic in professional medical <b>circles.</b> The heart <b>disease</b> is considered as the main risk factor. Therefore, doctors primarily concentrate on this area in the treatment and prevention. Nevertheless 25 percent of patients who died of sudden cardiac disease had no signs of heart disease. So it´s important to think about familial syndrome. The major role in therapeutic activities is played by antiarhytmic therapy, kardiovertru-defibrillator implantation or catheter ablation. The main objective of the research was to determine how the current society is informed about the risk of NSS, its causes and possible prevention. The possibilities of psychosocial rehabilitation for families with psychosocial impact from diagnosed sudden cardiac death of a family member were analyzed here as well. The first set of questions was focused on lifestyle diseases that are closely connected with NSS and significantly increase the risk. The answers revealed the current society is quite well informed about lifestyle diseases, mainly cardiovascular diseases. Despite this knowledge the Czech population health situation has not changed significantly and civilization diseases are growing instantly. Another set of questions focused on the NSS and its causes. A lot of survey respondents put emphasis on SAC prevention in contradistinction to experts who already work with endangered patients and focus on managing and control of life threatening arrhythmias. Approximately half of the respondents identified themselves as endangered because of their health problems (cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, etc.) More than 95 percent of the respondents expected impacts on the family and its relationships caused by the sudden cardiac death of a family member. Only 8 percent of the respondents put emphasis on potential social-economic changes. The research dealt with a problem whether the public is well-informed about possibilities of psychosocial rehabilitation. And the findings indicate it is not. More than 58 percent of the respondents try to solve problems themselves or with help of their family or friends. The responses to the survey confirmed the assumption that majority of the respondents (80 percent) know only about financial support from the state to the bereaved persons. And they would use only this state support if their family member died. Common people consider the using of psychosocial rehabilitation unavailable or they believe it is intended for the target group of psychologically ill people, mentally handicapped, alcoholics and drug addicts. A most of them don´t know that it could be used by the bereaved persons (91. 16 percent). Due to the activity developed by the MMR as counseling for bereaved persons, it seems that it could get better in the near future. The offered service called ?consultancy for the bereaved persons? could get widely into the public knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Malaria causes an {{estimated}} one million deaths annually {{although it is}} a curable disease if treated promptly and correctly. Most cases occur in young children in sub-Saharan Africa, supporting a vicious <b>circle</b> of <b>disease</b> and poverty. Hence, ensuring access to malaria treatment is a major public health and development priority. The purpose {{of this research was}} to evaluate the ACCESS programme, which aimed at understanding and improving access to malaria treatment in rural Tanzania. This evaluation focuses on the first phase of implementation of the programme, which covered the years between 2004 and 2008. The ACCESS strategy is based on a set of integrated interventions at three levels: 1) community level; 2) public heath facilities; and 3) commercial drug sector. The interventions are accompanied by a comprehensive set of monitoring and evaluation activities. Between 2004 and 2007 the ACCESS programme’s main intervention at community level was a social marketing campaign for improved recognition of the disease and more effective care seeking. Various communication channels were used and material developed to disseminate information on malaria transmission, symptoms and prevention as well as to stress the importance of prompt and effective treatment. Road shows were the main activity and included role plays, public lectures and quizzes. In addition, promotional materials (e. g. stickers, leaflets, t-shirts) were distributed, and billboards and posters displayed in public places. In health facilities the ACCESS programme intervened to improve quality of care. The main activity was refresher training for health facility staff based on Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) algorithms conducted in 2004 and 2005. In addition the study period saw the change of the first line treatment for malaria. In 2006 the Government of Tanzania switched from Sulphadoxine Pyrimethamine (SP) to the highly efficacious Artemether Lumefantrine (ALu), due to the high levels of resistance to SP. In parallel the Accredited Drug Dispensing Outlets (ADDOs) programme was rolled out in the study area from 2006 onwards to improve access to treatment and quality of care in commercial drug shops. The private retail sector plays a very important role in the delivery of antimalarial treatment in most African countries as retailers tend to be more accessible and flexible, especially with regards to opening hours and charges. However, unqualified staff invariably sell drugs they are not allowed to stock, which often includes antimalarials. The aim of the ADDO programme is to improve access to quality care in drug shops with a mix of dispenser training, incentives, accreditation and regulation. ALu was made available to the programme at a highly subsidised price towards the end of 2007. Findings from the monitoring and evaluation activities showed that access to malaria treatment improved following the interventions in health facilities and drugs shops. Drug shops became more available to the community (from 24 shops for every 100, 000 people in 2004 to 39 in 2008) and more accessible (from 71 % of households within 5 km of a shop in 2004 to 87 % in 2008) following the ADDO roll-out. In addition, the 2006 change of treatment policy from SP to ALu led to an increase in the availability of antimalarial drugs in health facilities (from 40 % to 80 % of months in stock of the drug). Treatment was generally more expensive in drug shops compared to health facilities and prices increased by 50 - 80 % in shops between 2004 and 2008. Nevertheless, antimalarial sales in private retail grew (from 49 % to 59 % of market shares). This {{is likely to be a}} result of increased availability and accessibility of shops but better quality of care may also have played a role. Unfortunately the ADDO programme was not able to promote widespread availability of ALu in its outlets (only one third of outlets were found to stock the drug in 2008). This resulted in a low uptake of the new drug (19 % of all malaria treatments sold or dispensed) despite the fact that it was available in almost all the health facilities in the area. Results from treatment seeking surveys conducted in the community showed an improvement in malaria treatment between 2004 and 2008. This was ascribed to: 1) improved access to treatment; and 2) a better understanding of the importance of prompt treatment thanks to social marketing campaigns. The proportion of fever cases treated with an antimalarial increased (from 86 % to 96 % between 2004 and 2008) as well as the proportion of cases treated promptly (80 % to 93 - 97 % doses started within 24 hrs). However, the proportion of cases taking a recommended treatment was only 53 % in 2008 since many cases were treated in the private retail sector where the first line treatment ALu was not widely available. Improved treatment appears to have had an impact on malaria morbidity and mortality. Community surveys showed a 28 % decrease in the incidence of fever (from 2. 5 to 1. 8 average cases per person per year between 2005 and 2008). Under-five mortality decreased by 17 % after the ACCESS interventions (from 28. 4 cases per 1000 person years in the period 1997 - 2004 to 18. 9 cases in 2008). However, due to the absence of a control it is difficult to know how much the ACCESS interventions contributed to this decrease compared to other malaria control strategies implemented in the area. In conclusion this thesis has shown that an integrated approach tackling both users and providers can lead to tangible improvements in access to malaria. This can in turn have a substantial impact on morbidity and mortality. Interventions targeting providers in sub-Saharan Africa should recognise the important role of the private sector. Social marketing has proven to be a successful strategy to sensitise users on the importance of prompt treatment...|$|R
40|$|Malaria is {{the most}} {{important}} parasitic infection in humans, causing an estimated one million deaths annually. Most cases occur in young children in sub-Saharan Africa, supporting the vicious <b>circle</b> of <b>disease</b> and poverty. Current control strategies have so far failed to reduce the disease in most parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITN) are effective in preventing malaria episodes and efficacious drugs (such as artemisinin-based combination therapies or ACTs) exist to cure malaria. However, a major problem is the delivery of quality health services, including life-saving drugs, to the ones in need. A variety of inter-linked factors influences patients’ access to prompt and effective treatment. While growing resistance against commonly used antimalarials such as chloroquine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is being addressed with the introduction of ACTs, obstacles to effective malaria treatment have been identified at the levels of the households (the demand side), the health system (the supply side), and in health policy. The present thesis aimed at contributing {{to a better understanding of}} factors influencing access to malaria treatment in a positive or a negative way. The insights gained should inform the development of targeted interventions to improve access to malaria treatment and help to develop a general access framework. The research was carried out as part of the ACCESS Programme, which aims to understand and improve access to effective malaria treatment in the districts of Kilombero and Ulanga, in south-eastern Tanzania. The ACCESS strategy is based on a set of integrated interventions, including (1) social marketing for improved care seeking at community level, (2) strengthening the quality of case-management in health facilities, and (3) strengthening the commercial drug retail sector. The interventions are accompanied by a comprehensive set of monitoring and evaluation activities. Quantitative, semi-quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data collection in the area of the local Demographic Surveillance System (DSS) and the nearby semi-urban centre of Ifakara. Between 2004 and 2006, community-based surveys were conducted to investigate treatment-seeking behaviour and estimate communityeffectiveness of malaria treatment. A shop census and mystery shoppers (simulated clients) were used to monitor drug availability and the performance of shopkeepers in the retail sector. The DSS served as sampling frame for the community-based studies and provided demographic indicators, including morbidity and mortality data. The investigation of treatment-seeking and illness perception revealed a better overlap of local and biomedical illness concepts than reported in earlier studies from the same area. This is likely to reflect the intensive social marketing and health education campaigns carried out during the past decade. Modern medicine was clearly preferred by most patients and 87. 5 % (95 % CI 78. 2 - 93. 8) of the fever cases in children and 80. 7 % (68. 1 - 90. 0) in adults were treated with one of the recommended antimalarials (at the time SP, amodiaquine or quinine). However, an estimation of community-effectiveness revealed that only 22. 5 % (13. 9 - 33. 2) of the children and 10. 5 % (4. 0 - 21. 5) of the adults received prompt and appropriate antimalarial treatment, despite high health facility usage rates. Quality of case-management was not satisfactory and the exemption mechanism for under-fives was not functional. Consequently, the commercial drug retail sector played an important complementary role in the provision of malaria treatment. In order to increase treatment effectiveness and maintain the high efficacy of the recently introduced ACT, both treatment sources should be strengthened and their quality should be improved. The seasonal movement of families to distant farming sites did not increase the risk of family members contracting malaria. In the fields, 97. 9 % (95. 2 - 100) of all people were protected with mosquito nets but since few households stocked antimalarials at home, treatment had to be sought from distant health facilities or drug stores. Of the episodes that happened in the fields, 88. 2 % (72. 6 - 96. 7) were finally treated with an antimalarial, indicating that households made a considerable effort to obtain malaria treatment. It appeared that during the farming season, difficulties to mobilize resources coupled with the long distance to treatment sources led to delays in treatment-seeking. In this context, a comprehensive approach should be considered to improve access to treatment while at the same time assuring rational use of medicines and protecting fragile livelihoods. Investigations in the retail sector found that antimalarial availability had decreased by almost 50 % in commercial shops following the policy change from chloroquine to SP as first-line treatment in 2001. This decline was noted mainly in general shops, which were not tolerated any more to sell SP (while they could generally sell chloroquine prior to the policy-change). In 2004, five out of 25 studied villages with a total population of 13, 506 (18 %) had neither a health facility, nor a shop as source of malaria treatment. While there was no immediately apparent impact on overall antimalarial use, the decline may have disproportionately affected the poorest and most remote groups in the community. In the light of the policy change to ACT these issues need to be addressed urgently if the benefits of these efficacious drugs are to be extended to the whole population. The assessment of shop keepers knowledge and behaviour revealed that drug store keepers had better knowledge of malaria and its treatment than their peers in general shops. In drug stores, mystery shoppers were more likely to receive an appropriate treatment (OR= 9. 6, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 60. 5), even though at a higher price. As a distribution channel for ACTs, complementary to health facilities, upgraded drug stores may be the most realistic option. However, shopkeepers in drug stores need to be trained on the provision of correct malaria treatment. At the same time, the role of general shops as first contact points for malaria patients needs to be re-considered. Taking the importance of shops into account, interventions to increase the availability of ACTs in the retail sector are urgently required within the existing legal framework. The insights gained in the ACCESS studies helped to design a generic access framework embedded into the context of livelihood insecurity. This framework links social science and public health research with broader approaches to poverty alleviation. Apart from offering an analytical frame for further scientific research, it suggests access policies and interventions that reach beyond health services. In conclusion, the findings of this thesis underline the need for a comprehensive approach to analyze and improve access to treatment. In this setting, health systems factors appear to be major obstacles to treatment, while local disease perceptions did not appear to have a big influence on treatment access. There is an urgent need to improve quality of care at all levels and new avenues have to be explored to achieve equitable coverage with essential health interventions. Health policies need to be formulated and implemented in a way that they effectively improve the quality of services for all population groups. Considering the close link of disease and poverty, any health intervention is unlikely to succeed without taking the demand side into consideration. A comprehensive approach should therefore not only include measures that enable patients to access providers of good quality care, but also contribute to the strengthening of household economies. In order to achieve a decline in malaria morbidity and mortality in Africa, a concerted effort of all stakeholders is required to translate efficacious tools into effective, equitable and sustainable interventions...|$|R
