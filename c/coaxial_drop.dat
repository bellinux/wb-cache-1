50|$|These taps {{pass the}} RF signal and block the AC power {{unless there are}} {{telephony}} devices that need the back-up power reliability provided by the coax power system. The tap terminates into a small <b>coaxial</b> <b>drop</b> using a standard screw type connector known as an F connector.|$|E
40|$|Bacterial infections often {{affect the}} wound, delaying healing and causing areas of necrosis. In this work, an aerogel {{in form of}} {{core-shell}} particles, able to prolong drug activity on wounds and to be easily removed was developed. Aerogel microcapsules consisted of a core made by amidated pectin hosting doxycycline, an antibiotic drug with {{a broad spectrum of}} action, and a shell consisting of high mannuronic content alginate. Particles were obtained by prilling using a <b>coaxial</b> nozzle for <b>drop</b> production and an ethanolic solution of CaCl 2 as gelling promoter. The alcogels where dried using supercritical CO 2. The influence of polysaccharides and drug concentrations on aerogel properties was evaluated. Spherical particles with high drug encapsulation efficiency (87 %) correlated to alginate concentration in the processed liquid feeds were obtained. The release of the drug, mainly concentrated into the pectin core, was prolonged till 48 h, and dependent on both drug/pectin ratio and alginate concentration...|$|R
5000|$|The {{last mile}} or last {{kilometer}} is a colloquial phrase {{widely used in}} the telecommunications, cable television and internet industries {{to refer to the}} final leg of the telecommunications networks that deliver telecommunication services to retail end-users (customers). More specifically, the last mile refers to the portion of the telecommunications network chain that physically reaches the end-user's premises. Examples are the copper wire subscriber lines connecting landline telephones to the local telephone exchange; <b>coaxial</b> cable service <b>drops</b> carrying cable television signals from utility poles to subscribers' homes, and cell towers linking local cell phones to the cellular network. The word [...] "mile" [...] is used metaphorically; the length of the last mile link may be more or less than a mile. Because the last mile of a network to the user is conversely the first mile from the user's premises to the outside world when the user is sending data (sending an email, for example), the term first mile is also alternately used.|$|R
