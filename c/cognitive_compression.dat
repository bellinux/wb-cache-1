40|$|In {{translating}} {{problems from}} a verbal description to algebraic notation, we consider what children will do with statements {{that do not}} have the syntactic constructions that may provoke the reversal errors of the “students–professors problem. ” MacGregor & Stacey (1993) show that children do not follow a simple word-matching order and postulate the existence of mental models that can be accessed in any order. We hypothesise that the children’s responses are a natural consequence of their previous development and show that, as the verbal problems become more complex, children are more likely to revert to a process-orientation with the arithmetic operation on the left, rather than an assignment order with the variable on the left. We place this in a theory of <b>cognitive</b> <b>compression</b> as the children grow in mathematical sophistication...|$|E

The program is then run a second time, with heavier weight given to substructures which utilize the previously discovered substructure. The increased weight reflects increased attention to this substructure. Fig. 2 shows the results after each pass. Note that on the third pass, SUBDUE linked together the instances of the substructure in the second pass to find the chains of the double helix. Results indicate that SUBDUE can discover pertinent substructures and find a hierarchical description of the input data by replacing previously discovered substructures on successive passes. V I. CONCLUSIONS Automated knowledge discovery is essential for extracting in-formation from databases [2]. Extiacting knowledge from struc-tural databases requires the identification of repetitive substructures in the data. The previous examples show how SUBDUE’S heuristic search and inexact graph match can discover interesting and repet-itive substructures in real structural domains. Applying SUBDUE to scene analysis assists in compression of the image and identifica-tion of similar objects in the scene. Application to chemical anal-ysis assists the discovery of previously unknown molecules and <b>cognitive</b> <b>compression</b> of the compound by abstracting over newly discovered molecules. Further experimentation is underway in both artificial domains and other real domains {{in order to determine}} the effects of parameters and reduce the computational requirements of SUBDUE’S substructure discovery algorithm...|$|E

The research used 16 fifth-grade beta coursed students to study {{the development of the}} cognitive structure and its relation to modelling. The methodology is based on the Conceptual Content Cognitive Map Method of Kearney and Kaplan (1997), while Tall's (2013) theory is the theoretical framework. Data are collected by a cognitive test and a modelling test. The results show that students with a rich <b>cognitive</b> structure develop <b>compression.</b> Thus, teachers should focus on the connections between mathematical concepts as a solution for this problem...|$|R
