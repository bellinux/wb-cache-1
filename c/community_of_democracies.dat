Liberty in the civic sense of the term meant to be able to partake of sovereignty to the same extent as national representatives. Two traditions, liberal and republican, contributed to the realization of these principles. Each tended to forge a <b>community</b> <b>of</b> equal men. One led citizens to liberty, the other to fraternity and service to the Nation State. But the liberty of individuals was forgotten. Because they are different, throughout the Nineteenth Century women were able to unmask the mystifications of this form <b>of</b> <b>democracy.</b> Only they understood the real meaning of republican principles.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, forests have played an {{important}} role in the transition from war to peace in Cambodia. Forest exploitation financed the continuation of war beyond the Cold War and regional dynamics, yet it also stimulated co-operation between conflicting parties. Timber represented a key stake in the rapacious transition from the (benign) socialism of the post-Khmer Rouge period to (exclusionary) capitalism, thereby becoming the most politicized resource of a reconstruction process that has failed to be either as green or as democratic as the international community had hoped. This article explores the social networks and power politics shaping forest exploitation, with the aim of casting light on the politics of transition. It also scrutinizes the unintended consequences <b>of</b> the international <b>community's</b> discourse <b>of</b> <b>democracy,</b> good governance, and sustainable development on forest access rights. The commodification of Cambodian forests is interpreted as a process of transforming nature into money through a political ecology of transition that legitimates an exclusionary form of capitalism...|$|R

40|$|On Europe's {{periphery}} lie {{a number}} of unresolved conflict and unrecognized states most of which emerged during {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union. Due to their remote and strategically insignificant nature, they were largely ignored by the West as it peacefully integrated Central and Eastern Europe into the <b>community</b> <b>of</b> liberal <b>democracies.</b> Russia utilized the lack of international concern to prolong the conflicts in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria and Nagorno-Karabakh and destabilize the smaller states emerging from the Soviet Union. The conflicts exploit a fundamental ambiguity in international law between sovereignty and self-determination. This study shows that NATO and the EU have the ability to resolve frozen conflicts through their influence on the third parties that are preserving them. Unlike earlier solutions made only by one or two great powers, NATO and the EU represent the majority <b>of</b> established <b>democracies</b> in the world. As they share common values, they can reach consensus on policy actions unlike the UN or OSCE. As large organizations of democratic states, they possess credibility that no other institution or great power combination has ever had before.

Furthermore, Russia and Turkey have a record of submitting to well-coordinated Western policy and exploiting differences in it if such coordination in lacking...|$|R
40|$|Falling Man by Don DeLillo casts {{the event}} of 9 / 11 and its {{aftermath}} {{in such a way}} that the novel itself enacts an aesthetic terror aimed at explicating the ubiquitous social-atmospheric elements of community- and identity-formation out of which terror precipitates. As DeLillo figures terrorism in the novel as apocalyptic in that it is a violence that reveals the violence constitutive <b>of</b> political <b>community,</b> including the political <b>community</b> <b>of</b> liberal <b>democracy,</b> which ostensibly relegates violence to domains not considered legitimately political. DeLillo’s novel, as an act of aesthetic terrorism, not only thematizes the instantiation of terror that precipitates out of the violence of the political, but also examines the distinct elements in the social-political environment that make the environment vulnerable to precipitations of terrorism. Ultimately the novel presents two gestures toward exodus from the terroristic atmosphere, but these gestures necessarily fail because, focusing too much on the body as an atomic entity, the novel lacks a sufficient acknowledgment of the nature of biopolitical control in the present era.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis investigates the major influences on U. S. decision-making regarding the {{enlargement of the}} North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) {{following the end of}} the Cold War. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many questioned the need for the Alliance’s continued existence. It was not obvious that NATO would survive, and indeed thrive in the twenty-first century. The United States has been the driving force behind NATO’s surprising endurance and growth. This thesis identifies key factors that have motivated American decision-makers to support the expansion of the Alliance’s membership {{since the end of the}} Cold War in 1989 – 1991. Time and again, evolving threats to transatlantic security have revealed the need to sustain the Alliance. Cold War fears of communist aggression were replaced by the dangers of instability created by ethnic and religious conflicts, as demonstrated in the Balkans. These dangers in turn gave way to menacing transnational terrorist organizations, including al Qaeda. As the threats changed, the importance of close political association at times trumped that of enhanced military capability. Cultivating the international <b>community</b> <b>of</b> free <b>democracies</b> by expanding NATO membership provided a framework to counter the emerging threats.

However, the country now has to assert its status and position in the Euro-Atlan-tic <b>community</b> <b>of</b> liberal <b>democracies.</b> Lithuania faces an arguably more complex agenda, which has no clear end-goals or deadlines. The security challenges are difficult to identify and predict. The global and European strategic environment is best characterised by an ever-growing uncertainty: the transatlantic relations continue to be tense, Russia, paradoxically, is balancing between the perspective of disintegration and re-emerging as an expansionist imperial power, and the Eu-ropean Union is undergoing {{one of the most}} severe internal crises in decades. At the same time, the major schools of international relations theory disagree on what to make of current world politics. Neorealist authors tend to give alar-mist, apocalyptic accounts of the future, if the nation states would despise the iron logic of geopolitics, whereas reflectivist, constructivist authors argue that the world is "what we make of it", and thus, can be changed. These two visions of interna-tional relations inevitably lead to different policy implications. This paper consists of two parts. In the first part, the authors address the cur-rent state of affairs in international relations theory, in particular, the rationalist...|$|R
