40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} how long single-dose prophylactic antibiotic regimens for burns surgery maintained plasma concentrations above the MICs for target organisms during surgery. Patients and methods: We monitored antibiotic plasma concentrations in 12 patients (mean +/- SD 43 +/- 12 % total burn surface area) throughout debridement surgery after {{administration of the}} standard prophylactic antibiotic dosing regimens of either 1 g of intravenous <b>cefalotin</b> or 4. 5 g of intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam. Results: The eschar debridement and grafting procedures ranged in duration from 2. 25 to over 8. 5 h. The duration of total plasma <b>cefalotin</b> concentration above an MIC of 0. 2 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus was 6. 49 +/- 2. 85 h, whereas the mean duration of total plasma piperacillin concentration above an MIC of 64 mg/L for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was only 1. 15 +/- 0. 59 h. None of the patients dosed with piperacillin/tazobactam was adequately protected {{for the duration of}} their surgery and adequate prophylaxis was only evident in four of the nine patients administered <b>cefalotin.</b> Conclusions: These results suggest a need to review antibiotic prophylaxis dosage regimens for burns surgery and the adoption of regimens that will minimize the risk of infection in this high-risk patient group.

Methods: Promoter regions of spa, lukE and agr RNAIII were cloned upstream of a modified luxABCDE reporter. Using disc diffusion assays, the effects of antibiotics were observed on gene expression and quantitative real-time PCR was employed to confirm the results. Assays were performed to measure biofilm formation in wild-type S. aureus and respective spa-deficient and small colony variant mutants {{in the presence of}} subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. Results: Expression of spa and lukE was stimulated by subinhibitory concentrations of penicillin and <b>cefalotin,</b> while agr RNAIII expression was not affected.

We also investigated the role of Arg 276 in cefotaxime hydrolysis. Methods: By site-directed mutagenesis and by use of the blaCTX-M- 1 gene as template, Arg- 276 was replaced with six different amino acids (Trp, His, Cys, Asn, Gly and Ser). MICs of b-lactams alone and in combination with b-lactamase inhibitors were established. The seven enzymes (CTX-M- 1 wild-type and six derived mutants) were purified by affinity chromatography, and kinetic parameters (kcat, Km, kcat/Km) towards <b>cefalotin</b> and cefotaxime were determined. Clavulanic acid IC 50 values were also assessed with all enzymes. Results: No increase in MICs of b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitor combination was detected with any of the six CTX-M- 1 -derived mutants, in agreement with the clavulanic acid IC 50 values. The MICs of cefo-taxime were clearly lower for the Escherichia coli harbouring the Trp, Cys, Ser and Gly CTX-M- 1 mutant enzymes than for CTX-M- 1, and these enzymes showed a clearly reduced catalytic efficiency towards cefotaxime.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of various classes of clinically relevant antibiotics at sub-lethal concentrations on virulence gene expression and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus. Findings LacZ promoter fusions of genes related to staphylococcal virulence were used to monitor the effects of antibiotics on gene expression in a disc diffusion assay. The selected genes were hla and spa encoding α-hemolysin and Protein A, respectively and RNAIII, the effector molecule of the agr quorum sensing system. The results were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, we monitored the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on the ability of S. aureus to form biofilm in a microtiter plate assay. The results show that sub-lethal antibiotic concentrations diversely modulate expression of RNAIII, hla and spa. Consistently, expression of all three genes were repressed by aminoglycosides and induced by fluoroquinolones and penicillins. In contrast, the β-lactam sub-group cephalosporins enhanced expression of RNAIII and hla but diversely affected expression of spa. The compounds <b>cefalotin,</b> cefamandole, cefoxitin, ceftazidime and cefixine were found to up-regulate spa, while down-regulation was observed for cefuroxime, cefotaxime and cefepime. Interestingly, biofilm assays demonstrated that the spa -inducing <b>cefalotin</b> resulted in less biofilm formation compared to the spa -repressing cefotaxime. Conclusions We find that independently of the cephalosporin generation, cephalosporins oppositely regulate spa expression and biofilm formation. Repression of spa expression correlates with the presence of a distinct methyloxime group while induction correlates with an acidic substituted oxime group. As cephalosporines target the cell wall penicillin binding proteins we speculate that subtle differences in this interaction fine-tunes spa expression independently of agr. </p...|$|E

40|$|Although the postantibiotic effect (PAE) {{is a well}} {{recognized}} phenomenon, {{the mechanism}} by which it is induced has not fully elucidated yet. It {{has been suggested that}} PAE is the time required by bacteria to synthesize proteins or mRNA characterized by a short half-life that are consumed during antibiotic treatment. This phenomenon is widely studied on Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative rods, while information about Gram-positive rods and Gram-negative cocci are scanty. To gain new insights on the PAE, this study was addressed to evaluated the time required by Moraxella catarrhalis and Lactobacillus planctarum to resume their physiological growth rate after exposure to various antibiotics. Methods PAE was estimated in accordance with the method of Craig and Gudmundsson using the following drugs: penicillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, <b>cefalotin,</b> ceftazidime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and azithromycin. Log-phase bacteria were exposed to drug at a concentration corresponding to 4 times the MIC value for 1 h. The drug was inactivated by 1 : 1000 dilution. Bacterial counts were determined at time zero, immediately after drug dilution, and at each hour after removal for 6 - 7 h by a pour-plate technique. The PAE was defined as the difference in time required by test and control cultures to increase by 1 log in CFU number. Results All drugs tested induced a PAE on the strains studied. M. catarrhalis registered PAE values ranging between 0, 5 (gentamycin) and 2 (ceftazidime, imipenem and azithromycin). With respect to L. plantarum a PAE between 0, 8 (<b>cefalotin)</b> and 3 hours (ciprofloxacin) were detected. Conclusion. These findings demonstrated that all the drugs tested were able to induce a PAE on the strains tested. This observation differs from that observed on Gram-negative rods characterised by negative PAE values induced by penicillins and cephalosporins. This results might reflect the different target of these compounds on these Gram-positive rods or the different affinity of the antibiotics to several PBPs that required more time to restore the physiological fitness of the bacterial cell...|$|E

They were divided randomly into two groups: one received antibiotic prophylaxis with <b>cefalotin</b> (1 g) and the other received the same antibiotic for five days. After the surgical intervention, the patients were evaluated {{at the time of}} hospital discharge, at the first return to the clinic (two weeks later) and 90 days after the date of the surgery with the surgical wound, with clinical examination of the surgical wound and laboratory tests on both groups. ResultsIt was observed that among the patients in the group with one day of antibiotic prophylaxis, 28. 6 % presented complications in the surgical wound, while in the group with five days, 27. 9 % presented complications. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that a single dose of antibiotic prophylaxis is as effective as a regimen of multiple doses in lumbar arthrodesis surgery at up to three levels. Thus, the costs and risks of subjecting patients to hospitalization under a prolonged drug regimen are unjustifiable...|$|E

40|$|Salmonella is an {{important}} pathogen of economic significance in both humans and animals. The majority of Salmonella infections in humans are self-limiting. In some patients the infection may be more severe and antimicrobial therapy essential, but infections by antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella strains may cause treatment failure. In the last years the emergence and spread of multi-drugs resistant Salmonella enterica strains represent a severe concern worldwide (1). The aim of this work was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance profile of 176 Salmonella spp. isolates obtained from different animal samples, in particular from swine, poultry and reptiles. Tigecycline {{was included in the}} trial to verify the susceptibility of Salmonella to this antimicrobial. Disk diffusion method was carried out with the following antibiotics: Nalidixic Acid, Ciprofloxacin, Enrofloxacin, Ampicillin, Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid, Cefotaxime, <b>Cefalotin,</b> Ceftazidime, Gentamycin, Kanamycin, Streptomycin, Amikacin, Tobramycin, Tetracycline, Tigecycline, Sulfonamide, Trimethoprim, Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole, Colistin, Nitrofurantoin, Chloramphenicol, Florfenicol. MIC was evaluated with microdilution method for antibiotics that resulted ineffective against the majority of the tested isolates and for Tigecycline. Disk diffusion method and MIC were performed as suggested by CLSI; the antimicrobial breakpoints for MIC evaluation were the following: Streptomyicin ≥ 64 µg/ml, Kanamycin ≥ 64 µg/ml, Tetracycline ≥ 16 µg/ml and Tigecycline ≥ 2 µg/ml (2). Most of the antibiotics tested resulted effective against more than 80...|$|E
40|$|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus {{has emerged}} as a {{pathogen}} associated with community-acquired infections worldwide. We report the spectrum of community-acquired S. aureus infections and compare the patients infected with methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant strains among patients aged < 20 years. Overall, 90 cases of community acquired S. aureus were detected in an 11 -year period. Clinical and microbiological data were registered. Fifty-nine (66 %) patients were male and the median age was two years. The majority (87 %) of the patients were hospitalized and chronic underlying illnesses were detected in 27 (30 %) cases. Overall, 34 (37. 8 %) patients had skin/soft tissue infections and 56 (62. 2 %) patients had deep-seated infection. Four (5. 1 %) patients were transferred to the intensive care unit and two (2. 6 %) died. Complications were detected in 17 (18. 9 %) cases, such as pleural effusion (41. 2 %), osteomyelitis (23. 5 %), and sepsis (17. 6 %). Six (6. 7 %) methicillin-resistant strains were detected. Patients infected with methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant strains had similar baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes. Approximately 93 % of the cases received systemic antibiotics, out of which 59 (65. 5 %) used oxacillin or <b>cefalotin.</b> Both methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains resulted in morbidity and death among children in this setting where methicillin-resistant strains are infrequent...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{samples were}} taken from 50 pigs in each of 59 farrow-to-finish {{production}} herds and from 40 pigs in each of four of five registered multiplying herds. Samples of feed and faeces were also collected from 17 of the production herds and from the four multiplying herds. The sera were tested for antibodies to Salmonella enterica by the Danish mix-ELISA, and the organisms were isolated, serotyped and sensitivity tested by standard techniques. The average within-herd seroprevalence was 3. 4 per cent {{and at least one}} pig tested seropositive in 21 of the 59 herds. In the multiplying herds, only a single seroreactor was detected. Salmonellae were isolated from only five of 95 feed samples, from two of the 17 herds sampled, Salmonella tennessee in four of five samples from one herd and an untypable strain in one of five samples from another Four infected faecal samples were detected in four herds; they harboured Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella bredeney or Salmonella london. No salmonellae were isolated from the samples of feed and faeces taken from the multiplying herds. The S london and S typhimurium had a law sensitivity to streptomycin, kanamycin and neomycin, and the S typhimurium also had low sensitivity to amoxycillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, <b>cefalotin</b> and cefoperazone. The other isolates were sensitive to all the antimicrobial agents tested...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the contamination sources, serotyping profiles, and antibiotic resistance patterns of Listeria monocytogenes isolated during the production of pickled white cheese. The genetic-relatedness of the isolates to EGD SLCC (5835) (1 / 2 a, lineage II) and ATCC (13932) (4 b, lineage I) reference strains was also determined with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) as a result of digestions with AscI and ApaI enzymes. Samples were collected from 16 different points in the production process of 4 different plants at 3 different times. Among the 192 samples examined, 17 (8. 85 %) were determined to be contaminated with Listeria spp. Three isolates (3. 53 %) obtained from raw milk, wall/ground, and press cases were identified as L. monocytogenes via the conventional culture method and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. These isolates were found to belong to serotype 4 b. According to antibiotic resistance testing against 10 antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, <b>cefalotin,</b> streptomycin, vancomycin, penicillin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), it was determined that isolates from raw milk and press cases were resistant to erythromycin. PPGE band patterns of the isolates displayed indistinguishable with AscI and 80 %- 94 % homology with ApaI. The isolates were observed to display high homology to ATCC (13932) and lower homology to EGD SLCC (5835) obtained by both enzymes.
