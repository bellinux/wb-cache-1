Vick's finances suffered, however, from poor management, bad investments and lawsuits. <b>Certified</b> <b>Financial</b> Planner Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003-2005, but resigned after Vick took bad advice from friends, made ill-conceived investments, overspent, and otherwise undermined the wealth-building plan that Smith had created. Smith's plan was for Vick to have a net wealth of $100 million by 2010; by that date Vick was actually an estimated $20million in debt.|$|E

2500|$|Cost. [...] Robert Stack {{provided}} the Treasury position that [...] "Treasury and the IRS have designed our regulations {{in a way}} that minimizes administrative burdens and related costs." [...] Estimates of the additional revenue raised seemed to be heavily outweighed by the cost of implementing the legislation. In March 2012 the Association of <b>Certified</b> <b>Financial</b> Crime Specialists (ACFCS) said FATCA was expected to raise revenues of approximately US$800 million per year for the US Treasury with the costs of implementation more difficult to estimate. ACFCS claimed it was extremely likely that the cost of implementing FATCA, [...] borne by the FFIs, would far outweigh the revenues raised by the U.S. Treasury, even excluding the additional costs to the US Internal Revenue Service for the staffing and resources needed to process the data produced. Contrary to established congressional practice, FATCA was not subject to a cost/benefit analysis by the Committee on Ways and Means. Perhaps not considered by Congress, the cost to the global financial institutions to implement FATCA has been reported to range from Forbes's estimate of US$8 billion a year (approximately ten times the amount of estimated revenue raised), to US$200 billion (based on per capita costs for Australia and the UK), to 1-2 trillion USD (chapter of the Chamber of Commerce).|$|E

40|$|This study {{contributes}} to the extant literature {{on the nature of}} earnings management surrounding initial public offerings (IPOs) by investigating the role of underwriter reputation. We argue that prestigious underwriters will protect their reputation by carefully monitoring and <b>certifying</b> <b>financial</b> information on IPO firms, thereby limiting any potential earnings manipulation. As a result, those IPO firms that are associated with more prestigious underwriters are likely to exhibit substantially less-aggressive earnings management. Conversely, we find the existence of a negative relationship between earnings management and the post-offer performance of an IPO firm's stocks only for those firms associated with less-prestigious underwriters.
