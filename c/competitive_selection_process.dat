It was initially conceived during the French Revolution and was intended to provide the Republic with a new body of professors, trained in the critical spirit and secular values of the Enlightenment. It has since developed into an institution which has become a platform for a select few of France's students to pursue careers in government and academia. Founded in 1794 and reorganised by Napoleon, ENS has two main sections (literary and scientific) and a <b>competitive</b> <b>selection</b> <b>process</b> consisting of written and oral examinations.

Intra-industry selection is then shown to influence the effectiveness of active labour market policies in countering the employment and welfare effects of a negative shock.

40|$|This paper briefly {{reviews the}} various efforts {{undertaken}} by the University of California to maintain diversity in the institution, and especially at its highly competitive flagship campuses, UCLA and Berkeley, {{in the face of}} the loss of affirmative action during the mid- 1990 s.   It demonstrates the continuing decline in representation of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in spite of these efforts, even as URMs have become the majority of all students in the state.   Although applications to the flagship campuses have doubled since 1995, and all groups have seen reductions in the percent of applicants offered admission, African American and Latino admittees have been reduced by 70 to 75 percent at UCLA and UC Berkeley, compared to just 35 and 40 percent for Asian and white applicants.   This disproportionate decline reflects the inequalities in the California educational system that fails to prepare African American, Native American and Latino students for highly <b>competitive</b> <b>selection</b> <b>processes</b> irrespective of their intellectual ability or likelihood of succeeding in their studies.   The consequences of continuing down the same path will likely result in the solidification of educational inequality and economic dislocations for the state.

40|$|We generalize the {{integrated}} system model of Smith and Ratcliff (2009) {{to obtain a}} new theory of attentional selection in brief, multielement visual displays. The theory proposes that attentional <b>selection</b> occurs via <b>competitive</b> interactions among detectors that signal the presence of task-relevant features at particular display locations. The outcome of the competition, together with attention, determines which stimuli are selected into visual short-term memory (VSTM). Decisions about the contents of VSTM are made by a diffusion-process decision stage. The <b>selection</b> <b>process</b> is modeled by coupled systems of shunting equations, which perform gated where-on-what pathway VSTM selection. The theory provides a computational account of key findings from attention tasks with near-threshold stimuli. These are (a) {{the success of the}} MAX model of visual search and spatial cuing, (b) the distractor homogeneity effect, (c) the double-target detection deficit, (d) redundancy costs in the post-stimulus probe task, (e) the joint item and information capacity limits of VSTM, and (f) the object-based nature of attentional selection. We argue that these phenomena are all manifestations of an underlying <b>competitive</b> VSTM <b>selection</b> <b>process,</b> which arise as a natural consequence of our theory...|$|R
40|$|While many {{models have}} {{investigated}} the role of <b>competitive</b> mate <b>selection</b> <b>processes</b> in human marriage, few have addressed the potential for assortative processes to explain the observed demographics, as well as simultaneously investigating divorce. To explore the possibility that assortative mate <b>selection</b> <b>processes</b> may explain patterns of both marriage and divorce, we developed an agent-based model, MADAM (Marriage and Divorce Annealing Model), based on homophilic trait matching, in which individuals search for mates similar to themselves, but relax these expectations as they age. MADAM assumes individuals {{live in a world}} with N mate-relevant traits, where each individual chooses a set of k traits from those N to represent his or her identity. Individuals seek marriage partners with some number of identical traits, but over time relax their expectations for this desired threshold number of matching traits. Divorce is allowed when individuals find a partner who shares more traits with them than their current partner. With this implementation, we explored how population heterogeneity and individual differences affect population-level demographic trends, finding that increasing population heterogeneity and a reduction in the rate of relaxing expectations can both increase the mean age at first marriage. MADAM also accurately predicts demographic marriage and divorce data across cultures, with quantitatively accurate predictions for length of first marriage, likelihood of first marriage ending in divorce, and percent of population married {{by the end of the}} lifespan.

This prototype design was selected through a comprehensive and traceable <b>selection</b> <b>process</b> applied to eight <b>competitive</b> designs.
