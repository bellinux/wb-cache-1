30|$|The {{charging}} of {{a surface}} in space {{is determined by}} the collection of ambient plasma as well as the emission of photoelectrons and/or secondary electrons (Whipple, 1981).

30|$|In Fig.  1, {{the switch}} (1) is an {{electronic}} SPST which controls the <b>charging</b> <b>status</b> of the lithium battery. It maintains the switch-off status as default, {{which means that}} the battery is not charged. If and only if the battery voltage is underneath the predefined level, the voltage comparator (1) triggers the switch (1) on, and the battery is charged at once if the solar panel could afford it. As soon as the charging starts for a few seconds, the battery voltage rises rapidly and changes the state of the comparator (1). That is why a RS trigger is required to keep the <b>charging</b> <b>status.</b> The control chip of the charging circuit is CN 3063 [38]. As charging is terminated, the pin END of the chip changes to low level, which turns the switch (1) off and disconnects the charging circuit. The switch status is also maintained by the RS trigger.|$|E
40|$|Polarimetry {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the binding abilities of a chiral calix[4]resorcinarene derivative, bearing L-proline subunits, towards a set of suitably selected organic guests. The simultaneous formation of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 host–guest inclusion complexes was observed in several cases, depending on both the <b>charge</b> <b>status</b> of the host {{and the structure of}} the guest. Thus, the use of the polarimetric method was thoroughly revisited, in order to keep into account the occurrence of multiple equilibria. Our data indicate that the stability of the host–guest complexes is affected by an interplay between Coulomb interactions, π–π interactions, desolvation effects and entropy-unfavorable conformational dynamic restraints. Polarimetry is confirmed as a very useful and versatile tool for the investigation of supramolecular interactions with chiral hosts, even in complex systems involving multiple equilibria...|$|R
40|$|Germanium has higher hole {{mobility}} {{and is a}} candidate for replacing silicon for pMOSFETs. This work reviews the recent progresses in understanding the negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) of Ge pMOSFETs and compares it with SiON/Si devices. Both Ge and SiON/Si devices have two groups of defects: as-grown hole traps (AHT) and generated defects (GDs). The generation process, however, is different: GDs are interface-controlled for SiON/Si and dielectric-controlled for Ge devices. This leads to substantially higher GDs under DC stress than under AC stress for Ge, although they are similar for SiON/Si devices. Moreover, GDs alter their energy levels with <b>charge</b> <b>status</b> and can be reset to original precursor states after neutralization for Ge, but these processes are insignificant for SiON/Si. The impact of these differences on lifetime prediction will be presented and the defects and physical mechanism will be explored...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this article}} we {{describe}} our efforts of extending demand-side control concepts to the application in portable electronic devices, such as laptop computers, mobile phones and tablet computers. As these devices feature built-in energy storage (in the form of batteries) {{and the ability to}} run complex control routines, they are well-suited for the implementation of smart charging concepts. We developed simple hardware and software based prototypes of smart charging controllers for a laptop computer that steer the charging process depending on the frequency of the electricity grid and in case of the software implementation also based on the battery <b>charge</b> <b>status.</b> If similar techniques are incorporated into millions of devices in UK households, this can contribute significantly to the stability of the electricity grid, help to mitigate the short-term power production fluctuations from renewable energy sources and avoid the high cost of building and maintaining conventional power plants as standby reserve...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Implicit in much {{research}} and application development for mobile phones {{is the assumption}} that the mobile phone is a suitable proxy for its owner’s location. We report an in-depth empirical investigation of this assumption in which we measured proximity of the phone to its owner over several weeks of continual observation. Our findings, summarizing results over 16 different subjects of a variety of ages and occupations, establish baseline statistics for the proximity relationship in a typical US metropolitan market. Supplemental interviews help us to establish reasons why the phone and owner are separated, leading to guidelines for developing mobile phone applications that can be smart with respect to the proximity assumption. We show it is possible to predict the proximity relationship with 86 % confidence using simple parameters of the phone, such as current cell ID, current date and time, signal <b>status,</b> <b>charger</b> <b>status</b> and ring/vibrate mode. ...|$|R
