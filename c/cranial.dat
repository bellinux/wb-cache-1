5|$|Multiple sclerosis, an {{inflammatory}} process that may produce {{a loss of}} the myelin sheathes which surround the <b>cranial</b> nerves, may cause a variety of shifting symptoms affecting multiple <b>cranial</b> nerves.|$|E
5|$|The {{accessory}} nerve is a <b>cranial</b> nerve that supplies the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. It {{is considered the}} eleventh of twelve pairs of <b>cranial</b> nerves, or simply <b>cranial</b> nerve XI, as {{part of it was}} formerly believed to originate in the brain. The sternocleidomastoid muscle tilts and rotates the head, while the trapezius muscle, connecting to the scapula, acts to shrug the shoulder.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS is {{classified}} into two main types, <b>cranial</b> leaks and spinal leaks. The {{vast majority of}} leaks are spinal. <b>Cranial</b> leaks occur in the head. In some of these cases, CSF can be seen dripping out of the nose, or ear. Spinal leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord. Both <b>cranial</b> and spinal spontaneous CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as spontaneous intracranial hypotension, diminished volume and pressure of the cranium. While referred to as intracranial hypotension, the intracranial pressure may be normal, with the underlying issue instead being low-volume CSF. For this reason SCSFLS {{is referred to as}} CSF hypovolemia as opposed to CSF hypotension.|$|E
5|$|The sensory ganglia are {{directly}} correspondent to {{dorsal root ganglia}} of spinal nerves and are known as <b>cranial</b> sensory ganglia. Sensory ganglia exist for nerves with sensory function: V, VII, VIII, IX, X. There are also parasympathetic ganglia, which {{are part of the}} autonomic nervous system for <b>cranial</b> nerves III, VII, IX and X.|$|E
5|$|A partial <b>cranial</b> endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT scan data, {{the first}} ever for a Parasaurolophus of any ontogenetic stage. The endocast was reconstructed in two sections, one on {{the portion of the}} braincase {{articulated}} with the left half of the skull and the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase. Their relative position was then approximated based on <b>cranial</b> landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids. Because of weathering, many of the smaller neural canals and foramina could not be identified for certain.|$|E
5|$|Inflammation {{resulting}} from infection may impair {{the function of}} any of the <b>cranial</b> nerves. Inflammation of the facial nerve (VII) may result in Bell's palsy.|$|E
5|$|People with <b>cranial</b> CSF leaks, the rarer form, have a 10% risk of {{developing}} meningitis per year. If <b>cranial</b> leaks last more than seven days, the chances {{of developing}} meningitis are significantly higher. Spinal CSF leaks cannot result in meningitis due to the sterile conditions of the leak site. When a CSF leak occurs at the temporal bone surgery becomes {{necessary in order to}} prevent infection and repair the leak. Orthostatic hypotension is another complication that occurs due to autonomic dysfunction when blood pressure drops significantly. The autonomic dysfunction is caused by compression of the brainstem, which controls breathing and circulation.|$|E
5|$|Some of the <b>cranial</b> nerves have sensory or {{parasympathetic}} ganglia (collections of cell bodies) of neurons, {{which are}} located {{outside of the}} brain (but can be inside or outside of the skull).|$|E
5|$|Ten of {{the twelve}} pairs of <b>cranial</b> nerves emerge {{directly}} from the brainstem. The brainstem also contains nuclei of many <b>cranial</b> and peripheral nerves, as well as nuclei involved in the regulation of many essential processes including breathing, control of eye movements and balance. The reticular formation, a network of nuclei of ill-defined formation, is present within and {{along the length of}} the brainstem. Many nerve tracts, which transmit information to and from the cerebral cortex to the rest of the body, pass through the brainstem.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cranial</b> nerves are {{considered}} {{components of the}} peripheral nervous system (PNS), although on a structural level the olfactory, optic and terminal nerves are more accurately {{considered part of the}} central nervous system (CNS).|$|E
5|$|The {{foramen spinosum}} is a foramen through the sphenoid bone {{situated}} in the middle <b>cranial</b> fossa. It {{is one of two}} foramina in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The foramen ovale is one of these two <b>cranial</b> foramina, situated directly anterior and medial to the foramen spinosum. The spine of sphenoid falls medial and posterior to the foramen. Lateral to the foramen is the mandibular fossa, and posterior is the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|The {{foramen spinosum}} {{is often used}} as a {{landmark}} in neurosurgery, due to its close relations with other <b>cranial</b> foramina. It was first described by Jakob Benignus Winslow in the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{accessory}} nerve {{is described as}} having a small <b>cranial</b> component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal accessory component before branching off of the nerve to join the vagus nerve. A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that {{in the majority of}} individuals, this <b>cranial</b> component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct components were separated by a fibrous sheath in all but one subject.|$|E
5|$|Trauma to the skull, {{disease of}} bone such as Paget's disease, and injury to nerves during {{neurosurgery}} (such as tumor removal) are other possible causes of <b>cranial</b> nerve damage.|$|E

5|$|A {{characteristic}} that distinguishes Cetiosauriscus {{is that it}} has axially concave summits on the <b>cranial</b> and middle caudal neural spines. Barosaurus differs from it in having a more complex sculpting laterally and ventrally in the caudals; in having a larger humerus-femur ratio; and in having differently developed chevrons.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to the {{pituitary}} lies {{a part of}} {{the skull}} base known as the cavernous sinus. This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles. 70% of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves. In half of these cases, the oculomotor nerve (the third <b>cranial</b> nerve), which controls a number of eye muscles, is affected. This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil. The fourth (trochlear) and sixth (abducens) <b>cranial</b> nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision, respectively. The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary. The cavernous sinus also contains the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain; occasionally, compression of the artery can lead to one-sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus alenquerensis {{was named}} in 1957 by Albert-Félix de Lapparent and Georges Zbyweski. It {{was based on}} post <b>cranial</b> {{material}} from Portugal. In 1990 this material was reassigned to Camarasaurus, but in 1998 it was given its own genus, Lourinhasaurus. This was further supported by the findings of Tschopp etal. in 2015, where Lourinhasaurus {{was found to be}} sister to Camarasaurus and other camarasaurids.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the {{vascular}} system by entering the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some <b>cranial</b> nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of <b>cranial</b> and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cranial</b> display features, {{such as the}} one {{possessed by}} Cryolophosaurus, make sense in social, gregarious animals, where other members of the species are {{available}} to observe and interpret messages of sexual status. Kevin Padian et al. (2004) challenged conventional hypotheses that the purpose of bizarre <b>cranial</b> structures and post-cranial armor in dinosaurs, was either for attracting mates, intimidating/fighting rivals in the group, or intimidating potential predators of other species. Padian et al. noted that based on phylogenetic, histological, and functional evidence these bizarre structures {{can be explained by the}} phenomenon of intra-species recognition, which is supported by the fossil evidence. Thomas R. Holtz Jr. (2010) found that the bizarre crest of Cryolophosaurus was primarily for intra-species recognition, based on evidence from related species and studies of bone texture. According to Thomas Rich and his colleagues, the crest would have been ineffective as a weapon and may have possibly functioned as a display feature during certain types of social behavior such as mating.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} position, the foramen {{is used as}} an anatomical landmark during neurosurgery. As a landmark, the foramen spinosum reveals the positions of other <b>cranial</b> foramina, the mandibular nerve and trigeminal ganglion, foramen ovale, and foramen rotundum. It may also be relevant in achieving haemostasis during trauma surgery.|$|E
5|$|Herrerasaurus had a {{flexible}} joint {{in the lower}} jaw that could slide {{back and forth to}} deliver a grasping bite. This <b>cranial</b> specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some lizards. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{scientists}} reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an Acrocanthosaurus <b>cranial</b> cavity using {{computed tomography}} (CT scanning) {{to analyze the}} spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, {{in addition to the}} brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and <b>cranial</b> nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor, providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid.|$|E
5|$|Jaw joint - The dentary (the {{lower jaw}} bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small <b>cranial</b> bone) meet {{to form the}} joint. In most gnathostomes, {{including}} early therapsids, the joint consists of the articular (a small bone {{at the back of}} the lower jaw) and quadrate (a small bone {{at the back of the}} upper jaw).|$|E
5|$|Many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} advanced {{as to what}} functions the <b>cranial</b> crest of Parasaurolophus performed, but most have been discredited. It is now believed {{that it may have}} had several functions: visual display for identifying species and sex, sound amplification for communication, and thermoregulation. It is not clear which was most significant at what times {{in the evolution of the}} crest and its internal nasal passages.|$|E
5|$|Prophylactic <b>cranial</b> {{irradiation}} (PCI) {{is a type}} of radiotherapy to the brain, used {{to reduce}} the risk of metastasis. PCI is most useful in SCLC. In limited-stage disease, PCI increases three-year survival from 15% to 20%; in extensive disease, one-year survival increases from 13% to 27%.|$|E
5|$|Several {{complications}} {{can occur}} {{as a result of}} SCSFLS including decreased <b>cranial</b> pressure, brain herniation, infection, blood pressure problems, transient paralysis, and coma. The primary and most serious complication of SCSFLS is spontaneous intracranial hypotension, where pressure in the brain is severely decreased. This complication leads to the hallmark symptom of severe orthostatic headaches.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cranial</b> {{features}} Ocepeia {{shares with}} primitive eutherians include eye-sockets (orbits) set further {{back on the}} skull, relatively narrow cheek bones (zygomatic arches), and details of the inner ear, while characters it shares with paenungulates their paenungulate-like ancestors include a wide nasal cavity and a very short bony projection in the eye-socket. Pneumatized skulls are also found in larger proboscideans (e.g. elephants, mastodons, and other extinct relatives).|$|E
5|$|The fibres of {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve originate solely in neurons {{situated in the}} upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, {{to the level of}} about C6. These fibres join together to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull's base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only <b>cranial</b> nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the <b>cranial</b> nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|The {{foramen spinosum}} varies {{in size and}} location. The foramen is rarely absent, usually unilaterally, {{in which case the}} middle meningeal artery enters the <b>cranial</b> cavity through the foramen ovale. It may be incomplete, which may occur in almost half of the population. Conversely, in a {{minority}} of cases (less than 1%), it may also be duplicated, particularly when the middle meningeal artery is also duplicated.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the <b>cranial</b> nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh <b>cranial</b> nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Saurolophus is its <b>cranial</b> crest, which {{is present in}} young individuals, but is smaller. It is long and spike-like and projects upward and backward at about a 45° angle, starting from over the eyes. This crest {{is often described as}} solid, but appears to be solid only at the point, with internal chambers that may have had a respiratory and/or heat-regulation function.|$|E
5|$|The motor {{system of}} the brain is {{responsible}} for the generation and control of movement. Generated movements pass from the brain through nerves to motor neurons in the body, which control the action of muscles. The corticospinal tract carries movements from the brain, through the spinal cord, to the torso and limbs. The <b>cranial</b> nerves carry movements related to the eyes, mouth and face.|$|E
5|$|The sensory {{nervous system}} is {{involved}} with the reception and processing of sensory information. This information is received through the <b>cranial</b> nerves, through tracts in the spinal cord, and directly at centres of the brain exposed to the blood. The brain also receives and interprets information from the special senses (vision, smell, hearing, and taste). Mixed motor and sensory signals are also integrated.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} early dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor {{therefore}} {{has important implications}} for the concept of dinosaurs as a monophyletic group (a group descended from a common ancestor). The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and Robert T. Bakker, who compiled a list of <b>cranial</b> and postcranial synapomorphies (common anatomical traits derived from the common ancestor). Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of Herrerasaurus by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one <b>cranial</b> and seven postcranial features were actually derived from a common ancestor, and that the others were attributable to convergent evolution. Sereno's analysis of Herrerasaurus also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.|$|E
5|$|Viewed from {{underneath}} {{between the two}} lobes is the third lobe the flocculonodular lobe. The cerebellum rests {{at the back of}} the <b>cranial</b> cavity, lying beneath the occipital lobes, and is separated from these by the cerebellar tentorium, a sheet of fibre.|$|E
