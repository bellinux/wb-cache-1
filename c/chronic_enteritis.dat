Anthropometric parameters and lymphocytes were the most affected. The severity of the denutrition was unrelated to the duration of the radiotherapy, the presence of an associated post-radiotherapy involvement of the colon or the urinary tract, a neoplastic recurrence, possible past-history of small bowel surgery; on the contrary, it was related to the extension of actinic lesions on the small bowel and to the presence of subocclusive manifestations.

40|$|Abstract] Objective. Glutamine {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a preventive treatment for toxicity related to cancer therapies. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the efficacy of glutamine in the prevention of radiation enteritis. Methods. A randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was performed including 69 patients who were assigned to receive either glutamine (Gln, 30 g/d) or placebo while they were receiving abdominal radiotherapy. Patients were re-evaluated 1 y after completion of treatment. The presence of <b>chronic</b> <b>enteritis</b> was assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. Nutritional status was evaluated using subjective global assessment, weight, and bioimpedance. Relative risk (RR) and its confidence interval (CI) were also calculated. Results. The trial initially included 69 patients (34 Gln, 35 placebo), but 11 patients were lost during follow-up (4 Gln, 7 placebo; P = 0. 296). <b>Chronic</b> <b>enteritis</b> was developed by 14 % of patients: Gln 16. 7 % versus placebo 11. 1 % (RR = 1. 33; 95 % CI, 0. 35 – 5. 03; P = 0. 540). Most cases of enteritis were grade I (75 %), with no differences between groups. The stool frequency increased after radiotherapy in patients who received Gln (from 1 ± 1 to 2 ± 2 stools per day, P = 0. 012), but remained unchanged with placebo (1 ± 1 stools per day, P = 0. 858; difference between groups P = 0. 004). There were no differences between the two groups in terms of weight, fat mass, or fat-free mass index, or between patients with enteritis and those without intestinal toxicity.

40|$|AbstractGlutamine {{is a major}} {{nutrient}} utilized by the intestinal epithelium and is primarily assimilated via Na-glutamine co-transport (NGcT) on the brush border membrane (BBM) of enterocytes. Recently we reported that B 0 AT 1 (SLC 6 A 19) mediates glutamine absorption in villus while SN 2 (SLC 38 A 5) does the same in crypt cells. However, how B 0 AT 1 and SN 2 are affected during intestinal inflammation is unknown. In the present study it was shown that during <b>chronic</b> <b>enteritis</b> NGcT was inhibited in villus cells, however, it was stimulated in crypt cells. Our studies also demonstrated that the mechanism of inhibition of NGcT during <b>chronic</b> <b>enteritis</b> was secondary {{to a reduction in}} the number of B 0 AT 1 co-transporters in the villus cell BBM without a change in the affinity of the co-transporter. In contrast, stimulation of NGcT in crypt cells was secondary to an increase in the affinity of SN 2 for glutamine without an alteration in the number of co-transporters. Thus, glutamine assimilation which occurs via distinct transporters in crypt and villus cells is altered in the chronically inflamed intestine...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNa-K-ATPase {{located on}} the basolateral {{membrane}} (BLM) of intestinal epithelial cells provides a favorable intracellular Na+ gradient to promote all Na dependent co-transport processes across the brush border membrane (BBM). Down-regulation of Na-K-ATPase activity has been postulated to alter the absorption via Na-solute co-transporters in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Further, the altered activity {{of a variety of}} Na-solute co-transporters in intact villus cells has been reported in animal models of <b>chronic</b> <b>enteritis.</b> But the molecular mechanism of down-regulation of Na-K-ATPase is not known. In the present study, using a rabbit model of chronic intestinal inflammation, which resembles human IBD, Na-K-ATPase in villus cells was shown to decrease. The relative mRNA abundance of α- 1 and β- 1 subunits was not altered in villus cells during chronic intestinal inflammation. Similarly, the protein levels of these subunits were also not altered in villus cells during <b>chronic</b> <b>enteritis.</b> However, the BLM concentration of α- 1 and β- 1 subunits was diminished in the chronically inflamed intestinal villus cells. An ankyrin–spectrin skeleton is necessary for the proper trafficking of Na-K-ATPase to the BLM of the cell. In the present study, ankyrin expression was markedly diminished in villus cells from the chronically inflamed intestine resulting in depolarization of ankyrin-G protein. The decrease of Na-K-ATPase activity was comparable to that seen in ankyrin knockdown IEC- 18 cells. Therefore, altered localization of Na-K-ATPase as a result of transcriptional down-regulation of ankyrin-G mediates the down-regulation of Na-K-ATPase activity during chronic intestinal inflammation...|$|E

An understanding of the skin and gill microbial assemblages and the factors which drive their composition may provide useful insights into the broad dynamics of fish host–microbial relationships, and may reveal underlying changes in health status. This is particularly pertinent to cultivated systems whereby various stressors may led to conditions (like enteritis) which impinge on productivity. As an economically important species, we assessed whether the outer-surface bacterial communities reflect a change in gut health status of cultivated Yellowtail Kingfish (Seriola lalandi). Active bacterial assemblages were surveyed from RNA extracts from swabs of the skin and gills by constructing Illumina 16 S rRNA gene amplicon libraries. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were predominant in both the skin and gills, with enrichment of key β-proteobacteria in the gills (Nitrosomonadales and Ferrovales). Fish exhibiting early stage <b>chronic</b> lymphocytic <b>enteritis</b> comprised markedly different global bacterial assemblages compared to those deemed healthy and exhibiting late stages of the disease. This corresponded to an overall loss of diversity and enrichment of Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, particularly in the gills. In contrast, bacterial assemblages of fish with late stage enteritis were generally similar to those of healthy individuals, though with some distinct taxa. In conclusion, gut health status is an important factor which defines the skin and gill bacterial assemblages of fish and likely reflects changes in immune states and barrier systems during the early onset of conditions like enteritis.
