5|$|The thistle {{has been}} one of the {{national}} emblem of the Scots nation since the reign of Alexander III (1249–1286) and was used on silver coins issued by James III in 1470. Today, it forms part of the emblem of the Scottish Rugby Union. As legend has it, an invading army had attempted to sneak up at night on the Scots. One, perhaps barefooted, unwelcome foreign soldier stumbled upon a Scots Thistle, and <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> pain, thus alerting Scots to their presence. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs, which marked the beginning of the departure of the Viking monarch Haakon IV of Norway, who had harried the coast for some years. Spiky plants such as brambles appear to have been used around forts since time immemorial, so the story, whether it factually relates to the Haakon episode or not, likely is the culmination of more than one such event over time. In some variants, it is invading English which stumble on a thistle, but the story predates this time.|$|E
5|$|Visits to Spandau of {{half an hour}} {{per month}} were allowed, but Hess forbade his family to visit until December 1969, {{when he was a}} patient at the British Military Hospital in West Berlin for a {{perforated}} ulcer. By this time Wolf Rüdiger Hess was 32 years old and Ilse 69; they had not seen Hess since his departure from Germany in 1941. After this illness, he allowed his family to visit regularly. His daughter-in-law Andrea, who often brought photos and films of his grandchildren, became a particularly welcome visitor. Hess's health problems, both mental and physical, were ongoing during his captivity. He <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the night, claiming he had stomach pains. He continued to suspect that his food was being poisoned and complained of amnesia. A psychiatrist who examined him in 1957 deemed he was not ill enough to be transferred to a mental hospital. Another unsuccessful suicide attempt took place in 1977.|$|E

Eckstein fired his two remaining bullets in Kasztner's direction, and then heard a shot by someone else, after which Kasztner <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> pain.|$|E

25|$|William T. G. Morton, another New England dentist, was {{a former}} student and then-current {{business}} partner of Wells. He was also a former acquaintance and classmate of William Edward Clarke (the two had attended undergraduate school together in Rochester, New York). Morton arranged for Wells to demonstrate his technique for dental extraction under nitrous oxide general anesthesia at Massachusetts General Hospital, {{in conjunction with the}} prominent surgeon John Collins Warren. This demonstration, which took place on 20 January 1845, ended in failure when the patient <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> pain {{in the middle of the}} operation.|$|E

2500|$|The Roman Catholic Church views Mary as {{the woman}} clothed with the sun in the Book of Revelation 12:1–3: [...] "A great and wondrous sign {{appeared}} in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> pain {{as she was about}} to give birth. Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads." [...] The Church accepts Revelation 12 as a reference to Mary, Israel, and the Church as a three-fold symbolism through the Book of Isaiah and affirms Mary as the mother of Jesus as the prophetic fulfilment described in Revelation 12 (cf. Isaiah 7:14, 26:17, 54:1, 66:7).|$|E
2500|$|Horace Wells {{conducted}} {{the first public}} demonstration of the inhalational anesthetic at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston in 1845. However, the nitrous oxide was improperly administered and the patient <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> pain. On 16 October 1846, Boston dentist William Thomas Green Morton gave a successful demonstration using diethyl ether to medical students at the same venue. Morton, who was unaware of Long's previous work, was invited to the Massachusetts General Hospital to demonstrate his new technique for painless surgery. After Morton had induced anesthesia, surgeon John Collins Warren removed a tumor from the neck of Edward Gilbert Abbott. This occurred in the surgical amphitheater now called the Ether Dome. The previously skeptical Warren was impressed and stated, [...] "Gentlemen, this is no humbug." [...] In a letter to Morton shortly thereafter, physician and writer Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. proposed naming the state produced [...] "anesthesia", and the procedure an [...] "anesthetic".|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} several {{references}} to necromancers – called [...] "bone-conjurers" [...] among Jews {{of the later}} Hellenistic period – in the Bible. The Book of Deuteronomy (...) explicitly warns the Israelites against engaging in the Canaanite practice of divination from the dead: [...] Though Mosaic Law prescribed the death penalty to practitioners of necromancy (...) , this warning was not always heeded. One of the foremost examples is when King Saul had the Witch of Endor invoke the Spirit of Samuel, a judge and prophet, from Sheol using a ritual conjuring pit (...) [...] [...] However, the so-called witch was shocked at {{the presence of the}} real spirit of Samuel for in I Sam 28:12 it says, [...] "when the woman saw Samuel, she <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a loud voice." [...] Samuel questioned his reawakening asking, [...] "Why hast thou disquieted me?" [...] Saul did not receive a death penalty (his being the highest authority in the land) but he did receive it from God himself as prophesied by Samuel during that conjuration.|$|E

The burning of civilian residences and farms had been already denounced at the Carlist Deputation at War on the session of 10 September. [...] The crowd <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Euskara ez dacuartelic suematen duenentzat! ("no quarter to the arsonists"). Spanish sources put the number of executions there at 60.

2500|$|... "After the {{two parts}} which I have already explained, at the left of Our Lady and a little above, we saw an Angel with a flaming sword in his left hand; flashing, it gave out flames that looked as though they would set the world on fire; but they died out {{in contact with the}} splendour that Our Lady {{radiated}} towards him from her right hand: pointing to the earth with his right hand, the Angel <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a loud voice: 'Penance, Penance, Penance!' And we saw in an immense light that is God: 'something similar to how people appear in a mirror when they pass in front of it' a Bishop dressed in White 'we had the impression that it was the Holy Father'. Other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women going up a steep mountain, at the top of which there was a big Cross of rough-hewn trunks as of a cork-tree with the bark; before reaching there the Holy Father passed through a big city half in ruins and half trembling with halting step, afflicted with pain and sorrow, he prayed for the souls of the corpses he met on his way; having {{reached the top of the}} mountain, on his knees at the foot of the big Cross he was killed by a group of soldiers who fired bullets and arrows at him, and in the same way there died one after another the other Bishops, Priests, Religious men and women, and various lay people of different ranks and positions. Beneath the two arms of the Cross there were two Angels each with a crystal aspersorium in his hand, in which they gathered up the blood of the Martyrs and with it sprinkled the souls that were making their way to God." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dian Wei {{later became}} a {{subordinate}} of Xiahou Dun, a general under the warlord Cao Cao. He was promoted to Major (司馬) for his efforts in battle. Around 194, Cao Cao attacked a rival warlord Lü Bu in Puyang (濮陽) and launched a surprise night attack on one of Lü's camps located 40-50 li west of Puyang. However, Lü Bu led reinforcements from Puyang and joined in the battle. Cao Cao and his forces were caught in an onrush by Lü Bu's forces. Dian Wei ordered dozens of men to gather around him, put on two layers of armour, discard their shields and arm themselves only with spears and jis. Another wave of enemy soldiers closing in from the west unleashed a barrage of arrows onto Dian Wei and his men. Dian Wei remained oblivious to the arrows and told his men, [...] "Let me know when the enemy is ten paces away." [...] The men did so. Dian Wei then said again, [...] "Let me know when they are five paces away." [...] The men then suddenly <b>cried</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> fear, [...] "The enemy is upon us!" [...] Dian Wei was holding on to a dozen jis, and he flung them at the enemy when they were near him. Each ji knocked down an enemy soldier {{and not a single}} ji missed its target. Lü Bu's forces retreated. By then, it was nearing dawn, so Cao Cao and his forces returned to their camp. Cao Cao was impressed with Dian Wei so he promoted the latter to Commandant (都尉). Dian Wei was placed in command of hundreds of Cao Cao's personal guards, who patrolled around Cao's tent. Dian Wei was a robustly built fighter, so the guards under his command were specially selected by him. In battle, Dian Wei and his men were always the first to charge into the enemy formation. Dian Wei was later promoted to Colonel (校尉).|$|E
