50|$|Sparky's Magic Baton (1954) {{returns to}} the musical vein, and tells how Sparky finds a <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton</b> in the street, and meets all the {{instruments}} of the orchestra. Sparky was voiced here by June Foray (although Lee LeDoux's name incorrectly appears on the label).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a system to}} control the playback of audio files {{by means of the}} standard classical conducting technique. Computer vision techniques are developed to track a <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton,</b> and the gesture is subsequently analysed. Audio parameters are extracted from the sound-file and are further processed for audio beat tracking. The sound-file playback speed is adjusted in order to bring the audio beat points into alignment with the gesture beat points. The complete system forms all parts necessary to simulate an orchestra reacting to a <b>conductor</b> 's <b>baton...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{transition}} was {{not without}} difficulties. The <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton</b> was passed from one after another; Boy Delarmente, then Renato Cortez and then Ricardo Mazo, who stayed {{at the helm of}} the choir for two years.In May 1999, when the CICM fathers transferred the parish to the diocesian clergy, Gerardo Fajardo was reinstated as choirmaster.|$|R

5000|$|The word [...] "{{baguette}}" [...] was {{not used}} to refer to a type of bread until 1920, but what is now known as a baguette may have existed well before that date. The word simply means [...] "wand", [...] "baton" [...] or [...] "stick", as in baguette magique (magic wand), baguettes chinoises (chopsticks), or baguette de direction (<b>conductor's</b> <b>baton).</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{installation}} invites {{visitors to}} touch a suitable RFID card, such as an Oystercard, against a reader and then generates a unique and repeatable gesture in space according to the serial number of the card, in a movement reminiscent of a <b>conductor’s</b> <b>baton</b> or magician’s wand. It explores the representation of data using physical movement and the generation of elegant motion...|$|R
50|$|Reed {{joined the}} Reed Group {{full-time}} in April 1994, {{as director of}} operations. He became Chief Executive in February 1997. To symbolise the handover of control of the company, Reed's father presented him with a <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton</b> mounted in a glass case. The baton now hangs {{on the wall of}} Reed's personal office at the company's headquarters in Covent Garden, London.|$|R

5000|$|Conducting {{has formed}} {{a large part of}} his {{activities}} for the past five years. He took up the <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton</b> in 2006. In addition to his compositions and stage performances as a pianist and conductor, he has released twelve solo albums. His first album, Akroasis, appeared on ECM Records. In The Independent, Andrew Clarke said, [...] "The effects are hypnotic and mysterious, shimmering like ancient mosaics".|$|R

50|$|Military bands, {{civilian}} brass {{bands and}} pipe bands generally use a mace for giving signals and commands while marching. As marching bands in the United States {{have started to}} focus more directly on halftime shows and less on parades, the traditional use of the mace has largely vanished {{from high school and}} college marching bands, in preference of hand movements, occasionally {{with the use of a}} <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton</b> or whistle.|$|R
25|$|For example, if two musicians, one {{standing}} on the front sideline of the football field {{and one on the}} back sideline, begin playing exactly when they see the beat of the <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton</b> or hand, the sound produced by the musician on the front sideline reaches listeners in the stands noticeably before the sound played by the back musician, and the musicians is seen to move before the sound reaches the stands.|$|R
50|$|Glendale Secondary School {{has enjoyed}} a strong {{enrollment}} in its music program for several decades. The band has travelled to various locations to perform, including, but not limited to: Walt Disney World, Florida (8 times), Disneyland (4 times), New Orleans (3 times), New York City, Washington D.C., Boston, Atlanta, San Diego, Bermuda, Japan, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg, VA, Chicago and Cleveland. More recently, the <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton</b> has been taken up by Glendale band alumnus.|$|R
50|$|Galileo Galilei first {{studied and}} {{discovered}} concepts involving the pendulum {{in the late}} 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1696, Etienne Loulié first successfully used an adjustable pendulum {{to make the first}} mechanical metronome—however, his design produced no sound, and did not have an escapement to keep the pendulum in motion. To get the correct pulse with this kind of visual devices, the musician watches the pendulum as if watching a <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton.</b>|$|R
50|$|Orchestras {{are usually}} {{led by a}} {{conductor}} who directs the performance with movements of the hands and arms, often made easier for the musicians to see by use of a <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton.</b> The <b>conductor</b> unifies the orchestra, sets the tempo and shapes {{the sound of the}} ensemble. The conductor also prepares the orchestra by leading rehearsals before the public concert, in which the conductor provides instructions to the musicians on their interpretation of the music being performed.|$|R
40|$|A {{system to}} track an uninstrumented <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton</b> by {{computer}} vision techniques is developed. An initial seek mode locates a baton in an image frame without prior knowledge; a subsequent track mode uses temporal information {{to cope with}} motion blur and noise. The seek mode utilises the characteristic form of detected edges to guide a maximal intensity trace. The track mode enhances this technique by dovetailing with optical flow to give robust tracking, even with considerable motion blur and poor quality images...|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War II, the Abadjiev family settled in Berlin, where Vasco perfected playing the violin and piano, composition, and counterpoint. He gave concerts under the <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton</b> of Wilhelm Furtwängler, Karl Böhm, Heinz Bongartz, Hermann Abendroth, Willem Mengelberg and other famous conductors, and played in numerous ensembles for chamber music or solo concerts. The harsh war and post-war years affected the extremely sensitive mentality of Vasco Abadjiev. After {{the death of his}} father in 1947 he spared considerable time for composition and chamber music.|$|R

50|$|Reed {{has held}} the {{positions}} of Chief Executive, Executive Chairman, non-executive Chairman and Founder at Large during his career at the Reed group of companies. In 1997 he stepped down as Chief Executive to become Chairman, handing {{control of the company}} to his son James; to mark the handover, Reed presented his son with a <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton</b> in a glass case. Reed became non-executive chairman in 2000 and Founder at Large in 2004, a position he still holds and which he assumed after his son James succeeded him as chairman in the same year.|$|R
50|$|The music video, {{which was}} filmed in Sydney, Australia, shows a {{homeless}} man on a street moving his hands as if playing a piano. He observes a tattooed man washing a car window and then leaving the window wiper down on a bench.

50|$|While on the ground, upsetter Mysto {{plays with}} his magic wand, but soon realizes he can pass {{it off as}} a <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton,</b> being further {{inspired}} by seeing himself {{in place of the}} conductor in a promotional poster outside the door and plans to get revenge on Poochini. Later, as the performance is starting he freezes the conductor, steals his tuxedo, nose and hair, then takes his place in front of the orchestra to conduct the Great Poochini, who is unaware of the imposter in front of him.|$|R

Part of the hallway and the first room bear memorial character. All of the rooms of the museum are devoted to the creativity M.Rostropovich and specific periods in his life.|$|R
50|$|This {{sculpture}} {{is one of}} two Polyphony sculptures made by Egon Weiner; Polyphony is a {{much larger}} version of Polyphony II. These bronze sculptures are made up of geometric shapes. Long poles and large triangles are intertwined in a maze-like piece coming from a central area in the base. Weiner ultimately created Polyphony to symbolize the rhythm and motion of a <b>conductor’s</b> <b>baton</b> as he directed his orchestra. The inscriptions on the sculpture are as follows: POLYPHONY BY EGON WEINER 1963 on the northeast corner of the circular platform and KRIA.KUNST & METALSTOBERI-OSLO-NORWAY on the southwest corner of bronze platform.|$|R
5000|$|In this uneasy climate, the PNL finally {{passed the}} 1923 Constitution, {{thereafter}} criticized {{as the beginning}} of a PNL-ist guided democracy. As Florescu notes, [...] "Brătianu was not inclined to renounce, even for a short while, his <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton.</b> ... Because of this, the modernization of Romanian political life was subordinated to Ion I.C. Brătianu and the liberals, which proved to be a decisive obstacle in the natural evolution of political life, in its adjustment to the new epoch." [...] When the PNR-led opposition suggested a political boycott, Averescu sided with the PNL, announcing that his men were the [...] "orderly opposition".|$|R
5000|$|Piero Piccioni {{came into}} contact with the movie world in Rome during the fifties, when he was a {{practicing}} lawyer securing movie rights for Italian distributors such as Titanus and De Laurentiis. During that time, Michelangelo Antonioni had called Piero to score a documentary film directed by Luigi Polidoro, one of his apprentices. Piccioni’s first score for a feature film was Gianni Franciolini’s Il mondo le condanna (1952). He consequently changed his lawyer's [...] "toga" [...] for a <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton.</b> He developed close-knit working relationships with directors Francesco Rosi and Alberto Sordi, and established strong personal and professional bonds with them.|$|R
5000|$|Mariquita {{was engaged}} by Albert Carré as ballet {{mistress}} at the Opéra Comique in 1898 where she remained until 1920, creating some 60 shows, while continuing {{her role as}} director of dance at the Folies Bergère. Carré reported that she [...] "knew the dances of every period and from every country". According to Cléo de Mérode, despite her small size, she was an imposing figure, always standing straight {{so as not to}} diminish her height. Wherever she went, she had her lorgnette and her fan with her. She always held her fan in her right hand, using it as a <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton.</b>|$|R

50|$|In later years, Rampal {{took up the}} <b>conductor's</b> <b>baton</b> {{with more}} frequency, but he {{continued}} to play well into his late 70s. The last work of importance dedicated to him was Krzysztof Penderecki's Flute Concerto, which he premiered in Switzerland in 1992, followed by its first performance in America at Lincoln Center. Rampal's last public recital {{was held at the}} Theatre Villamarta in Jerez de la Frontera (Spain) in November 1999, when he was 77; he performed works by Bach, Mozart, Kuhlau and Mendelssohn. His last recording was made with the Pasquier Trio and flautist Claudi Arimany (trio and quartets by Mozart and Hoffmeister) in Paris in December 1999.|$|R
