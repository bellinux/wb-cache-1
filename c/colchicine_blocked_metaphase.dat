Cells arrested by colchicine synthesized small amounts of hyaluronate, whereas cells blocked by cytochalasin were stimulated in hyaluronate production. When the <b>colchicine</b> <b>block</b> was released, there was an increased synthesis of hyaluronate, which appeared first in the cellular fraction and was then shed into the culture medium. After release of the cytochalasin block, the hyaluronate production declined to that found with unsynchronized cells. A comparable increase of hyaluronate synthase activity was observed during mitosis. When hyaluronate synthesis was blocked by periodate-oxidized UDP-glucuronic acid, the cells were arrested in mitosis before rounding of cells.

During early prophase there is no antiactin staining associated with the mitotic centers, but by late prophase, as the spindle is beginning to form, a small ball of actin antigenicity is found beside the nucleus. After nuclear envelope breakdown, the actiactin stains the region around each mitotic center, and becomes organized into fibers that run between the chromosomes and the poles. <b>Colchicine</b> <b>blocks</b> this organization, but does not disrupt the staining at the poles.

40|$|Experimental {{allergic}} encephalomyelitis (EAE) {{is widely}} regarded as a laboratory analog of multiple sclerosis (MS). Recent evidence both in MS and EAE point to the fact that activated macrophages appear to be proximal agents of myelin destruction (1). In view of these findings and encouraged by the preliminary results of a trial of colchicine in MS patients, we asked the question whether or not colchicine might be effective in the prevention of EAE. Colchicine is a unique antiinflammatory agent whose traditional use has been in the treatment and prophylaxis of acute gout (2). In addition, colchicine is also effective against a variety of inflammatory disorders such as familial Mediterranean fever and Behcet's disease which resemble MS in their cardinal features of recurrent inflammation and enhanced chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Murine EAE was induced both by active sensitization of animals with neural antigens and by adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic T cells.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{influences}} of leukocytes on the dimorphism of Coccidioides immitis, mycelial elements (arthroconidia) or spherules were incubated with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) or mononuclear leukocytes. In the presence of human leukocytes, arthroconidia became septated spherules as determined by electron microscopy but grew as mycelia when viable leukocytes were absent. Plasma was not required for this effect. In a new assay, PMNLs, lymphocytes, or monocytes from human blood as well as rabbit alveolar macrophages inhibited spherules from forming germ tubes. In flat-bottomed glassware, maximal inhibition occurred with PMNL:spherule ratios above 15 : 1, whereas in conical-bottomed glassware a ratio of 3 : 1 was maximally suppressive with PMNLs as well as mononuclear leukocytes.

40|$|Hypoxia plays a {{key role}} in tumor cell survival, invasion, and metastasis. Here we show that hypoxia {{increases}} tumor cell invasion by the modulation of Rab 11, an important molecule for vesicular trafficking, especially membrane protein recy-cling and translocation of proteins from trans-Golgi network to plasma membrane. Dominant-negative Rab 11 dramatically decreased hypoxia-induced invasion of MDA-MB- 231 breast carcinoma cells without affecting cell apoptosis. Hypoxia-induced Rab 11 trafficking is regulated by microtubule stability, as evidenced by the findings that hypoxia increases Glu tubulin and that <b>colchicine</b> <b>blocks</b> Rab 11 trafficking and invasion. Inhibition of GSK- 3 B activity by hypoxia seems to be central to microtubule stabilization and invasion. In fact, expression of a dominant-negative GSK- 3 B was sufficient to stimulate invasion in normoxia. One target of Rab 11 -mediated trafficking that contributes to invasion is the integrin A 6 B 4. Hypoxia induced a significant increase in A 6 B 4 surface expression but it had no effect on the surface expression of A 3 B 1. This increase is dependent on Rab 11 and stable microtubules. In summary, we identify vesicle trafficking as a novel target of hypoxic stimulation that is important for tumor invasion. (Cancer Res 2005; 65 (7) : 2761 - 9...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Rationale: Because of its antifibrotic and {{anti-inflammatory}} effects, colchicine {{has been}} proposed {{as a treatment for}} liver disease. Early in vitro studies have demonstrated that <b>colchicine</b> <b>blocks</b> mitosis in the metaphase and inhibits DNA synthesis. Aim: A pilot study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) -related/HBV-DNA+ve chronic liver disease. Patients: Nine biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis patients (three with cirrhosis) entered the study. Two of them were HBeAg+ve and seven were antiHBe(+). All patients were HBV-DNA+ve/antiHBc IgM+ve (index values of anti-HBc IgM ranged from 0. 370 to 1. 200). All of them had a major contraindication to interferon therapy or refused antiviral treatment. The known persistence of positive HBsAg ranged from 2 to 21 years. Methods: After informed consent, the patients received 1 mg colchicine a day orally for 5 days-a-week over 6 months. Testing for liver enzymes and viral markers was performed at the baseline and after 3 and 6 months. Results: None of the patients experienced side-effects during the treatment. The two HBeAg+ve patients seroconverted to anti-HBe with a normalization of AST/ALT during therapy. Among the seven antiHBe+ve patients, four had a complete normalization of transaminases (one patient cleared the HBsAg with seroconversion to anti-HBs). Six of the nine patients were HBV-DNA-ve at the end of therapy and were still negative after 12 months of follow-up. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that colchicine might have an antiviral activity in HBV-DNA+ve chronic liver disease, and it could be regarded as an alternative therapy to interferon...|$|R
40|$|Reliable and {{quantitative}} assays to measure in vivo autophagy are essential. Currently, there are varied methods for monitoring autophagy; however, it {{is a challenge}} to measure “autophagic flux” in an in vivo model system. Conversion and subsequent degradation of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP 1 -LC 3 /LC 3) to the autophagosome associated LC 3 -II isoform can be evaluated by immunoblot. However, static levels of endogenous LC 3 -II protein may render possible misinterpretations since LC 3 -II levels can increase, decrease or remain unchanged in the setting of autophagic induction. Therefore, it is necessary to measure LC 3 -II protein levels in the presence and absence of lysomotropic agents that block the degradation of LC 3 -II, a technique aptly named the “autophagometer. ” In order to measure autophagic flux in mouse skeletal muscle, we treated animals with the microtubule depolarizing agent colchicine. Two days of 0. 4 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal <b>colchicine</b> <b>blocked</b> autophagosome maturation to autolysosomes and increased LC 3 -II protein levels in mouse skeletal muscle by > 100 %. the addition of an autophagic stimulus such as dietary restriction or rapamycin led to an additional increase in LC 3 -II above that seen with colchicine alone. Moreover, this increase was not apparent {{in the absence of a}} “colchicine block. ” Using this assay, we evaluated the autophagic response in skeletal muscle upon denervation induced atrophy.

This {{study was designed}} to test whether DA (10 � 5 M) would increase lung edema clearance in rats exposed to 100 % O 2 for 64 h. Active Na � transport and lung edema clearance decreased by approximately 44 % in rats exposed to acute hyperoxia (p � 0. 001). DA increased lung edema clearance in room air breathing rats (from 0. 50 � 0. 02 to 0. 75 � 0. 06 ml/h) and in rats exposed to 100 % O 2 (from 0. 28 � 0. 03 to 0. 67 � 0. 03 ml/h). Disruption of cell microtubular transport system by <b>colchicine</b> <b>blocked</b> the stimulatory effect of DA on active Na � transport in control and hyperoxic rats, whereas the isomer �-lumicolchicine, which does not affect cell microtubular transport, did not inhibit the stimulatory effects of dopamine.

40|$|The multidrug {{resistance}} (mdr) genes encode P-glycoproteins, integral membrane proteins which function as drug efflux transporters. Exposure {{of animals in}} vivo and cells in vitro {{to a variety of}} xenobiotics leads to increased mdr 1 gene expression and higher levels of P-glycoprotein. This response may protect cells from the cytotoxic effects of these compounds. In this investigation we functionally expressed the rat mdr 1 b gene in NIH 3 T 3 cells and assessed the ability of the encoded P-glycoprotein to protect these cells from the cytotoxicity of xenobiotics known to induce mdr 1 b expression. In long-term colony survival assays, stably expressed mdr 1 b conferred resistance to cytotoxic drugs such as colchicine, vinblastine and doxorubicin, but not to 5 -fluorouracil nor to the carcinogens aflatoxin B 1 and N-hydroxy-acetylaminofluorene. The mdr reversal agent verapamil restored cytotoxicity of colchicine, doxorubicin, actinomycin D, vinblastine and taxol, but had no effect on the sensitivity of these cells to 5 -fluorouracil, aflatoxin B 1 or N-hydroxy-acetylaminofluorene. In a competitive transport assay, verapamil and, to a lesser extent, <b>colchicine</b> <b>blocked</b> the increased efflux of the fluorescent dye rhodamine 123 from mdr 1 b-transfected cells, whereas aflatoxin B 1 did not compete for this export.

40|$|The anti-tumor {{effects of}} {{chemotherapy}} and radiation {{are thought to}} be mediated by triggering G 1 /S or G 2 /M cell cycle checkpoints, while spindle poisons, such as paclitaxel, <b>block</b> <b>metaphase</b> exit by initiating the spindle assembly checkpoint. In contrast, we have found that 150 kilohertz (kHz) alternating electric fields, also known as Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), perturbed cells at the transition from metaphase to anaphase. Cells exposed to the TTFields during mitosis showed normal progression to this point, but exhibited uncontrolled membrane blebbing that coincided with metaphase exit. The ability of such alternating electric fields to affect cellular physiology is likely to be dependent on their interactions with proteins possessing high dipole moments. The mitotic Septin complex consisting of Septin 2, 6 and 7, possesses a high calculated dipole moment of 2711 Debyes (D) and plays a central role in positioning the cytokinetic cleavage furrow, and governing its contraction during ingression. We showed that during anaphase, TTFields inhibited Septin localization to the anaphase spindle midline and cytokinetic furrow, as well as its association with microtubules during cell attachment and spreading on fibronectin. After aberrant metaphase exit as a consequence of TTFields exposure, cells exhibited aberrant nuclear architecture and signs of cellular stress including an overall decrease in cellular proliferation, followed by apoptosis that was strongly influenced by the p 53 mutational status. Thus, TTFields are able to diminish cell proliferation by specifically perturbing key proteins involved in cell division, leading to mitotic catastrophe and subsequent cell death...|$|R

The inhibitory effect of colchicine could not be accounted for by diminution in cell viability or by metaphase arrest of mitosis in the stimulated cells. Moreover, the inhibition of [SH]thymidine incorporation was not due to blockage of thymidine transport or inhibition of DNA synthesis inasmuch as addition of colchicine had no effect on cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. The time of inhibition was correlated with the kinetics of cellular commitment to lectin activation and the kinetic data indicated that <b>colchicine</b> <b>blocks</b> stimulation early in the sequence of events following addition of the mitogen. These findings support the hypothesis that cytoplasmic microtubular function plays a role in the commitment of resting cells to undergo mitotic division. Although the detailed mechanism of lymphocyte stimulation by mitogens such as concanavalin A (Con A) 1 is not understood, it is generally assumed that specific interactions between certain cell surface receptors and the mitogen are responsible for the subsequent activation of the appropriate metabolic machinery in the cytoplasm and nucleus (4, 12). On the basis of studies on the modulation of lymphocyte surface receptor mobility by tetramerit native Con A (40), dimeric succinyl-Con A (14), and colchicine and related drugs (8, 41, 42), we have suggested the hypothesis that the membrane receptor-cytoplasmic interactions are mediated by an assembly of colchicine-binding proteins, most likely the microtubules.

It was assumed that IPC, like colchicine, was causing these effects by disruption of the spindle apparatus by destroying the spindle microtubules. The animal hormone melatonin causes an increase in birefringence of the mitotic spindle in animal cells, presumably by increasing the number of microtubules. We have studied the effects of IPC, melatonin, and combinations of the two on mitosis in dividing endosperm cells of the African blood lily (Haemanthus katherinae Baker) in vivo by phase-contrast and polarization microscopy. Both qualitative and quantitative data are presented. Interpretation of these results has been aided materially by a time-lapse cinemicrographic analysis of dividing cells subjected to 1 and 10 p. p. m. IPC (unpublished) and by an accompanying fine-structural analysis of untreated and IPC-treated cells. Mitosis was disrupted by O-OI-IO p. p. m. IPC, the severity of the effect depending on both concentration and stage of mitosis of the cell at the time of treatment. Concentrations of IPC that caused cessation of chromosome movement also caused loss of birefringence of the mitotic spindle. Melatonin increased birefringence of the mitotic spindle in these plant cells and partly nullified the adverse effects of IPC. The results of this study demonstrate that the herbicide IPC, under our conditions, causes disruption of mitosis and loss of birefringence of the spindle. And it has been established that an animal hormone is capable of increasing the birefringence, and presumably the number of microtubules, of the mitotic spindle in dividing endosperm cells of a higher plant.

40|$|The shoot apex of rice, Oryza sativa CV Balilla was {{studied with}} a view to obtaining {{information}} about the meristematic activity of the different regions. The vegetative state only was studied and the rice was grown for 4 - 5 days at 30 anddeg;C or 35 anddeg;C under 4 cm water in darkness, intermittent white light or continuous white, red, far-red or blue light. The part of the shoot apex studied was that above the level of the youngest leaf primordium and it was divided into six regions which took into account the tunica and corpus and regions of leaf initiation. The mitotic index was found every 2 hrs. throughout 24 hrs. in plants growing in continuous darkness, in a 12 hr. day with white light of 10, 000 lux and in continuous white light of 2, 400 lux. The mitotic index varied little and no pronounced synchrony was evident under any of these conditions. The mitotic index of the flank and corpus regions was higher than that of the summit and sub-summit regions. The meristematic activity of the regions was investigated further using colchicine to accumulate <b>metaphases.</b> <b>Colchicine</b> <b>blocks</b> mitosis at <b>metaphase,</b> but does not affect the rate of entry of the cells into mitosis. The gradient of the increase in metaphases over 3 - 4 hours was used to calculate the cell-doubling time in each region and the effects of different environments on this were found. Cells of the summit region were found to divide at least 7 times more slowly than cells of the flanks and corpus and intermediate rates occurred in tie sub-summit regions. In 10, 000 lux white light and at 30 anddeg;C, the cell-doubling time for flanks and corpus averaged 13 hours which is shorter than any reported for equivalent regions in other plants. Cell-doubling times for the summit were over [illegible] hrs. In experiments where the intensity of white light varied during the growth of the seedlings a different relationship between the regions was found. The cells of the flanks and corpus divided more slowly and only about twice as fast as in the summit. The effect on cell-doubling times of excision on the shoot was studied and the immediate result was to speed up cell cycles in the leaf primordium and corpus. Excision has often been used to facilitate entry of a chemical into the shoot apex and it may have given a misleading picture of the situation in undisturbed shoot apices. Nuclear DNA synthesis in the regions was studied using tritiated-thymidine. In 1, 000 lux continuous white light the flanks and corpus showed a gradual increase in labelling throughout the feeding which lasted for 72 hrs. while the sub-summit and summit regions showed a negligible or low level of labelling in the same period of time. The level of DNA synthesis taking place in the regions thus paralleled that of meristematic activity found by using colchicine. The supply of tritiated thymidine to plants grown in continuous white light at 10, 000 lux produced a non-linear low labelling pattern which could not be easily explained. Many attempts were made to overcome this lack of success involving excision, and surgery of various kinds, use of (6 - 3 H) thymidine as well as (methyl- 3 H) thymidine and experimentation with red, far-red and blue light. However, none of those succeeded and so a pulse-labelling experiment was not attempted. The effect of an acute dose of X-rays was studied by finding the mitotic index immediately afterwards, andfrac 12;hr. afterwards and 24 hrs. afterwards and by studying the level of metaphases after colchicine in control and irradiated plants. A dose of 1, 2, 4 and 8 k. rad had a differential effect on the regions which is interpreted as a reflection of their different levels of meristematic activity. No stimulation of division of the summit was found which is the reverse of what has been found in the quiescent centre of roots after acute X-irradiation, although this region in often equated to the summit of the shoot. A study of cell pattern throughout a plastochron suggested on the basis that evidence of cell division and cell size are related, that meristematic activity in the tunica is highest in the flanks and that, as the activity progresses round the circumference of the apex {{in the formation of the}} leaf primordium, which sheaths the stem, cell division also takes place for a short distance toward the summit. In this way, preparation for formation of a leaf primordium occurs sometimes before it appears as a bump. The summit is considered to be carried forward passively and not to contribute a significant number of cells to the rest of the meristem. This interpretation supports the view that the summit is not the site of apical initials in higher plants as considered by the orthodox view. A study of the effect on cell kinetics of red and far-red light by using accumulation of metaphases with colchicine revealed a change in response to far-red light with the age of the seedling. Forty hrs. red and far-red light given to dark-grown 3 andfrac 12; day-old seedlings caused increased meristematic activity to take place in all regions but 16 hrs. far-red light reduced activity and 16 hrs. red light was stimulating. Forty hrs. far-red light after 2 andfrac 12; days dark gave high rates similar to 4 andfrac 12; day-old plants given 16 hrs. far-red. Comparison of these rates on the basis of the age of the seedling at the end of the treatment revealed that plants which are 5 days old had similar rates after 16 or 40 hrs. far-red, but plants which were 4 days old had higher rates after 40 hrs. far-red than after 16 hrs. far-red. Variation of response to far-red with age of the seedling has been found before and the link between phytochrome and leaf initiation is discussed. All regions of the apex, including the summit respond to light by a speeding-up of mitotic cycles but the summit is still at least seven times slower than the flanks and corpus. Finally, consideration is given to the significance of the results in rice and the mandeacute;ristandegrave;me d'attente controversy. Cell divisions in the summit may vary in importance in different apices but in the absence of the possibility of proving presence or absence of apical initials the controversy is put aside. The shift of growth balance in apices of plants subjected to different conditions is brought out and the importance of the summit to growth of the shoot apical meristem and the nature of its influence is discussed. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : 2 -Ethyl- 3 -O-sulphamoyl-estra- 1, 3, 5 (10) 16 -tetraene (ESE- 16) is a unique, in silico-designed {{compound}} {{with possible}} anticancer properties, which {{were identified in}} our laboratory. This compound is capable of interfering with microtubule dynamics and {{is believed to have}} potential carbonic anhydrase IX inhibiting activity. In this study, it was investigated whether ESE- 16 is capable of inducing apoptosis in vitro in the esophageal carcinoma SNO cell line via the intrinsic pathway at a concentration of 0. 2 μM with an exposure time of 24 hours. RESULTS : Qualitative results were obtained via light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. Results showed hallmarks of apoptosis in the ESE- 16 -treated cells. In addition, data revealed {{an increase in the number}} of ESE- 16 -treated cells <b>blocked</b> in <b>metaphase.</b> Cell death via apoptosis in the ESE- 16 -treated cells was confirmed by studying the internal ultrastructure of the cells via transmission electron microscopy, while confocal microscopy revealed abnormal spindle formation and condensed chromatin in ESE- 16 -treated cells, thus confirming <b>metaphase</b> <b>block.</b> Quantitative results were obtained via flow cytometry and spectrophotometry. Cell death via apoptosis in ESE- 16 -treated cells was quantitatively confirmed by the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection assay. Flow cytometry and spectrophotometry revealed dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in superoxide levels in the ESE- 16 -treated cells when compared to the relevant controls. Both initiator caspase 9 and effector caspase 3 activities were increased, which demonstrates that ESE- 16 causes cell death in a caspase-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS : This was the first in vitro study conducted to investigate the action mechanism of ESE- 16 on an esophageal carcinoma cell line. The results provided valuable information on the action mechanism of this potential anticancer agent. It can be concluded that the novel in silico-designed compound exerts an anti-proliferative effect on the esophageal carcinoma SNO cell line by disrupting microtubule function resulting in <b>metaphase</b> <b>block.</b> This culminates in apoptotic cell death via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This research provided cellular targets warranting in vivo assessment of ESE- 16 ’s potential as an anticancer agent.

40|$|Cellular microtubules, microfilaments, {{and surface}} receptors have been {{postulated}} {{to form a}} surface modulating assembly that regulates surface receptor mobility and cell growth. To test this hypothesis, we examined three agents known to affect cell growth [colchicine, concanavalin A (Con A), and the src gene product of Rous sarcoma virus] for their effects on chick embryo fibroblasts. Individual cells from serum-starved normal fibroblast populations became committed to enter S phase at various times over a 12 hr period after exposure to serum. Colchicine and other microtubule-disrupting agents blocked entry into S phase at a point close to the commitment point for each cell. The lectin Con A also blocked entry into the S phase when present in doses sufficient to modulate surface receptor mobility. In contrast, succinyl-Con A, which does not induce surface modulation, had no effect. Both Con A and <b>colchicine</b> <b>blocked</b> the appearance of cytoplasmic factors capable of stimulating DNA replication in a cell-free system. To study endogenous effects on the surface modulating assembly, we infected fibroblasts with a Rous sarcoma virus (tsNY 68) having a temperature-sensitive mutation in the transforming (src) gene. We have previously shown that microtubular and microfilamentous structures of the surface modulating assembly are direct or indirect targets of the src gene product with consequent reduction in the capacity of Con A to induce surface modulation. TsNY 68 -infected fibroblasts shifted to the non-permissive temperature acquired normal microtubular morphology more rapidly (2 hr) than cells grown at the permissive temperature {{in the presence of}} protein synthesis inhibitors (7. 5 hr). This suggests that the src gene product acts directly on the surface modulating assembly rather than via the nucleus or at the level of protein synthesis. Furthermore, "transformation" of the surface modulating assembly was partly blocked by treatment of the infected cells with Con A but not succinyl-Con A. Both Con A and colchicine inhibited entry into the S phase following a shift from nonpermissive to permissive growth conditions. All of these observations are in accord with the hypothesis that the surface modulating assembly acts as a signal regulator in growth control...|$|R
40|$|The two isoforms of the Rab 6 GTPase, Rab 6 A and Rab 6 A′, {{regulate}} a {{retrograde transport}} route connecting early endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum via the Golgi complex in interphasic cells. Here {{we report that}} when Rab 6 A′ function is altered cells are unable to progress normally through mitosis. Such cells are <b>blocked</b> in <b>metaphase,</b> despite displaying a normal Golgi fragmentation and with the Mad 2 -spindle checkpoint activated. Furthermore, the Rab 6 effector p 150 Glued, a subunit of the dynein/dynactin complex, remains associated with some kinetochores. A similar phenotype was observed when GAPCenA, a GTPase-activating protein of Rab 6, was depleted from cells. Our results suggest that Rab 6 A′ likely regulates {{the dynamics of the}} dynein/dynactin complex at the kinetochores and consequently the inactivation of the Mad 2 -spindle checkpoint. Rab 6 A′, through its interaction with p 150 Glued and GAPCenA, may thus participate in a pathway involved in the metaphase/anaphase transition...|$|R
40|$|The P 2 X 7 {{receptor}} {{is associated}} with two different membrane permeabilities: a small cation conductance which opens within milliseconds, followed {{by the appearance of}} a second channel carrying higher molecular weight compounds (including organic dyes) after prolonged agonist stimulation. This activation profile has also been found in cells expressing P 2 X 2 and P 2 X 4 receptors; however, the P 2 X 7 receptor-dependent pathway has the unique ability to activate pro-inflammatory signalling in macrophages. In this issue of the BJP, Marques-da-Silva et al. demonstrate that colchicine is a potent inhibitor of both P 2 X 7 and P 2 X 2 receptor-dependent dye uptake, without affecting the ion channels. <b>Colchicine</b> also <b>blocked</b> the pro-inflammatory signalling downstream of P 2 X 7 receptor activation, both in vitro and in vivo. This report suggests that the dye uptake associated with activation of P 2 X 7 receptors is distinct from the P 2 X 7 receptor ion channel and could be a therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic inflammation...|$|R
40|$|DNA damage induces mitotic exit delays {{through a}} process that {{requires}} the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which <b>blocks</b> the <b>metaphase</b> to anaphase transition {{in the presence of}} unaligned chromosomes. Using time-lapse confocal microscopy in syncytial Drosophila embryos, we show that DNA damage leads to arrest during prometaphase and anaphase. In addition, functional GFP fusions to the SAC components MAD 2 and Mps 1, and the SAC target Cdc 20 relocalize to kinetochore through anaphase arrest, and a null mad 2 mutation blocks damage induced prometaphase and anaphase arrest. We also show that the DNA damage signaling kinase Chk 2 is required for damage induced metaphase and anaphase arrest, and that a functional GFP-Chk 2 fusion localizes to kinetochores and centrosomes through mitosis. In addition, in the absence of Chk 2, we find that DNA damage sufficient to fragment centromere DNA does not delay mitotic exit. We conclude that DNA damage signaling through Chk 2 triggers Mad 2 -dependent delays in mitotic progression, both before or after the metaphase-anaphase transition...|$|R

40|$|HeLa cells <b>blocked</b> in <b>metaphase</b> with 0. 04 micrograms/ml of the {{microtubule}} poison nocodazole {{were shown}} to contain large numbers of microtubules with typical mitotic organization but no cenriole. Lysis of nocodazole-poisoned cells in a microtubule reassembly buffer containing 0. 5 M PIPES, 2. 5 % dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM GTP, 1 % Triton X- 165, 0. 5 % sodium deoxycholate, 0. 2 % SDS, pH 6. 9, preserved metaphase aster structures 5 micrograms in diameter surrounded only by a thin, fibrous cell remnant. Inclusion of 2 mg/ml porcine brain microtubule protein in the lysis buffer produced asters up to 20 micrometers in diameter with a birefringent retardation of 5 - 6 nm. In these large asters the central microtubules had normal morphology, but peripheral microtubules were clearly abnormal. Our interpretation is that in high PIPES lysis buffer, exogenous brain tubulin adds to the distal ends of preexisting aster microtubules to form abnormal microtubules. This observation supports the assumptions made by Borisy and by Summers and Kirschner in their interpretation of growth experiments to determine the microtubule polarity in mitotic structures...|$|R
40|$|We {{discovered}} that many proteins {{located in the}} kinetochore outer domain, but not the inner core, are depleted from kinetochores and accumulate at spindle poles when ATP production is suppressed in PtK 1 cells, and that microtubule depolymerization inhibits this process. These proteins include the microtubule motors CENP-E and cytoplasmic dynein, and proteins involved with the mitotic spindle checkpoint, Mad 2, Bub 1 R, and the 3 F 3 / 2 phosphoantigen. Depletion of these components did not disrupt kinetochore outer domain structure or alter metaphase kinetochore microtubule number. Inhibition of dynein/dynactin activity by microinjection in prometaphase with purified p 50 “dynamitin” protein or concentrated 70. 1 anti-dynein antibody blocked outer domain protein transport to the spindle poles, prevented Mad 2 depletion from kinetochores despite normal kinetochore microtubule numbers, reduced metaphase kinetochore tension by 40 %, and induced a mitotic <b>block</b> at <b>metaphase.</b> Dynein/dynactin inhibition did not block chromosome congression to the spindle equator in prometaphase, or segregation to the poles in anaphase when the spindle checkpoint was inactivated by microinjection with Mad 2 antibodies. Thus, a major function of dynein/dynactin in mitosis is in a kinetochore disassembly pathway that contributes to inactivation of the spindle checkpoint...|$|R
40|$|The metaphase-anaphase {{transition}} is orchestrated through proteolysis of numerous proteins by a ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C). A crucial {{aspect of this}} process is sister chromatid separation, which is thought to be mediated by separase, a thiol protease activated by the APC/C. Separase cleaves cohesin, a ring-shaped complex that entraps sister DNAs. It is a matter of debate whether cohesin-independent forces also contribute to sister chromatid cohesion. Using 4 D live-cell imaging of Drosophila melanogaster syncytial embryos <b>blocked</b> in <b>metaphase</b> (via APC/C inhibition), we show that artificial cohesin cleavage is sufficient to trigger chromosome disjunction. This is nevertheless insufficient for correct chromosome segregation. Kinetochore-microtubule attachments are rapidly destabilized by the loss of tension caused by cohesin cleavage in the presence of high Cdk 1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) activity, as occurs when the APC/C cannot destroy mitotic cyclins. Metaphase chromosomes undergo a bona fide anaphase when cohesin cleavage is combined with Cdk 1 inhibition. We conclude that only two key events, opening of cohesin rings and downregulation of Cdk 1, are sufficient to drive proper segregation of chromosomes in anaphase...|$|R
