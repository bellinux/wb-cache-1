40|$|Abstract—Compact, light, and {{low power}} {{consumption}} communications equipment {{is required for the}} small satellites. For such restriction of the resources in the spacecrafts, we propose a non-mechanical, compact optical terminal equipped with a two-dimensional laser array. A laser beam is transmitted by selecting the laser pixel corresponding to the direction of the optical signal received from the <b>counter</b> <b>terminal.</b> The beams are not deflected by a mechanical mirror. Instead, they are turned on and off one after the other in accordance with the direction from which optical signals are received. Multiple-input multipleoutput operation is possible in this configuration. The nonmechanical transceiver can facilitate a reduction {{in the size of the}} optical communications system. This paper presents the basic concept of a non-mechanical compact transceiver with a two-dimensional laser array for optical wireless communications. I...|$|E
40|$|Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), either fiber based or free-space, {{allows for}} provably secure key {{distribution}} solely {{based on the}} laws of quantum mechanics. Feasibility of QKD systems in aircraft-ground links was demonstrated with a successful key exchange. Experiment flights were undertaken during night time {{at the site of}} the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The aircraft was a Dornier 228 equipped with a laser communication terminal, originally designed for optical data downlinks with intensity modulation and direct detection. The <b>counter</b> <b>terminal</b> on ground was an optical ground station with a 40 cm Cassegrain type receiver telescope. Alice and Bob, as the transmitter and receiver systems usually are called in QKD, were integrated in the flight and ground terminals, respectively. A second laser source with 1550 nm wavelength was used to transmit a 100 MHz signal for synchronization of the two partners. The so called BB 84 protocol, here implemented with faint polarization encoded pulses at 850 nm wavelength, was applied as key generation scheme. Within two flights, measurements of the QKD and communication channel could be obtained with link distance of 20 km. After link acquisition, the tracking systems in the aircraft and on ground were able to keep lock of the narrow QKD beam. Emphasis of this paper is put on presentation of the link technology, i. e. link design and modifications of the communication terminals. First analysis of link attenuation, performance of the QKD system and scintillation of the sync signal is also addressed...|$|E
40|$|Inmarsat’s {{geostationary}} satellite Alphasat, launched on July 25, 2013, {{is the largest}} European telecommunications satellite ever built with a weight of 6. 6 tons. For technology demonstration it is carrying different payloads, hereunder the laser communication terminal (LCT) built by Tesat-Spacecom and operated by DLR/GSOC. Its purpose is to establish bidirectional data links with data rates of up to 1. 8 Gbit/s. Links can be either within space, so called inter-satellite links (ISL) to <b>counter</b> <b>terminals</b> in low Earth orbit (LEO), or from the {{geostationary satellite}} to terminals mounted on ground stations on the Earth’s surface, space-toground links (SGL). This paper gives an overview about the LCT operations aboard Alphasat and its <b>counter</b> <b>terminals.</b> The corresponding work flow from visibility computations over link scheduling until command generation is described. Furthermore, it provides a deeper insight into the flight dynamics tasks that comes along with the operations of an LCT, such as visibility calculations and pointing performance analysis.

40|$|The European Space Agency {{is going}} to conduct an inter orbit link {{experiment}} which will connect a low Earth orbiting satellite and a Geostationary satellite via optical terminals. This experiment has been called SILEX (Semiconductor Inter satellite Link EXperiment). Two payloads will be built. One called PASTEL (PASsager de TELecommunication) will be embarked on the French Earth observation satellite SPOT 4. The future European experimental data relay satellite ARTEMIS (Advanced Relay and TEchnology MISsion) will carry the OPALE terminal (Optical PAyload Experiment). The principal characteristic of the mission is a 50 Megabits flow of data transmitted via the optical satellite link. The relay satellite will route the data via its feeder link thus permitting a real time reception in the European region of images taken by the observation satellite. The PASTEL terminal {{has been designed to}} cover up to 9 communication sessions per day with an average of 5. The number of daily contact opportunities with the low earth orbiting satellite will be increased and the duration will be much longer than the traditional passes over a ground station. The terminals have an autonomy of 24 hours with respect to ground control. Each terminal will contain its own orbit model and that of its <b>counter</b> <b>terminal</b> for orbit prediction and for precise computation of pointing direction. Due to the very narrow field of view of the communication laser beam, the orbit propagation calculation needs to be done with a very high accuracy. The European Space Agency is responsible for the operation of both terminals. A PASTEL Mission Control System (PMCS) is being developed to control the PASTEL terminal on board SPOT 4. The PMCS will interface with the SPOT 4 Control Centre for the execution of the PASTEL operations. The PMCS will also interface with the ARTEMIS Mission Control System for the planning and the coordination of the operation. It {{is the first time that}} laser technology will be used to support inter-satellite links in Europe. Due to the complexity and experimental character of this new optical technology, the SILEX experiment control facilities will be designed to allow as much operational flexibility as possible...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—As free-space laser {{communications}} systems proliferate due to improved technology and transmission techniques, optical communication networks comprised of ground stations, aircraft, high altitude platforms, and satellites become an attainable goal. An important consideration for optical networks {{is the ability}} of optical communication terminals (OCT) to quickly locate one another and align their laser beams to initiate the acquisition sequence. This paper investigates promising low-cost technologies and novel approaches that will facilitate the targeting and acquisition tasks between <b>counter</b> <b>terminals.</b> Specifically, two critical technology areas are investigated: position determination (which includes location and attitude determination) and inter-terminal communications. A feasibility study identified multipleantenna global navigation satellite system (GNSS) systems and GNSS-aided inertial systems as possible position determination solutions. Personal satellite communication systems (e. g. Iridium or Inmarsat), third generation cellular technology (IMT- 2000 /UMTS), and a relatively new air traffic surveillance technology called Autonomous Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) were identified as possible inter-terminal communication solutions. A GNSS-aided inertial system and an ADS-B system were integrated into an OCT to demonstrate their utility in a typical optical communication scenario. Testing showed that these technologies have high potential in future OCTs, although improvements can be made to both to increase tracking accuracy...|$|R

30|$|Safety {{applications}} usually demand direct V 2 V ad hoc communication networks due {{to highly}} dynamic topology {{of the networks}} and the stringent delay requirements [6]. They will likely work in a broadcast fashion since safety information can be beneficial to all vehicles around a sender and safety message senders might not expect a response at the application level. For the purpose of high reliability and simple implementation, some direct (or single-hop) broadcast solutions to safety-related message transmission have been suggested and investigated. Xu et al. [7] propose several single-hop broadcast protocols to improve reception reliability and channel throughput. Torrent-Moreno et al. [8] propose a priority access scheme for IEEE 802.11 -based vehicular ad hoc networks and show that the broadcast reception probability can become very low under saturation conditions. Jiang et al. [9] raise channel congestion control issues for vehicular safety communication, and introduce feedback information to enhance system performance and reliability. ElBatt et al. [10] discuss the suitability of DSRC periodic broadcast message for cooperative collision warning application. To date, all analyses and observations are mainly based on simulations [8, 11]. Although the connectivity of unicast wireless networks is studied theoretically [12], the factors that affect DSRC system performance and reliability such as IEEE 802.11 backoff <b>counter</b> process, hidden <b>terminals,</b> channel access priority, message generation interval, and high mobility on the road have not been theoretically addressed yet {{for the analysis of}} the DSRC safety broadcast communications. As a matter of fact, the exact analysis of such broadcast ad hoc networks with hidden terminal is still an open problem [13].|$|R
