5|$|Abramson was {{a leading}} {{architect}} of synagogue-centers at that time. He designed a number of New York examples, including the original synagogue-center, the Manhattan Jewish <b>Center</b> (1918), {{as well as the}} Brooklyn Jewish <b>Center,</b> the Flatbush Jewish <b>Center,</b> and the Ocean Parkway Jewish <b>Center</b> (all constructed in Brooklyn between 1920 and 1924). While the Flatbush Jewish <b>Center</b> has been completely remodeled, the Brooklyn and Ocean Parkway Jewish Centers are visually similar to the East Midwood Jewish <b>Center,</b> and the Brooklyn Jewish <b>Center</b> in particular has an identical layout. The written evidence consists of an entry in a souvenir journal commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the Flatbush Jewish <b>Center,</b> stating that Abramson drew East Midwood's plans. The NRHP nomination form speculates that Abramson drew the basic plans for the East Midwood <b>Center,</b> and that the Building Committee completed them, in order to save money.|$|E
