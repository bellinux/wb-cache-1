5|$|Under Protocol 3, Jersey {{is part of}} the European Union Customs Union of the European Community. The <b>common</b> <b>customs</b> <b>tariff,</b> levies {{and other}} {{agricultural}} import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is free movement of goods and trade between the island and Member States. EU rules on freedom of movement for workers do not apply in Jersey. However, Article 4 of the Protocol requires the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that {{the scope of this article}} included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island is therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister have attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The French blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey is not part of the single market in financial services. It is not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., The Wall Street Journal) labelling the island a tax haven.|$|E

This provided a customs union, a common external tariff, currency, and postage. It also dealt with common services in transport and communications, research, and education. Following independence, these integrated activities were reconstituted and the EAHC {{was replaced by}} the EACSO, which many observers thought would lead to a political federation between the three territories. The new organisation ran into difficulties {{because of the lack of}} joint planning and fiscal policy, separate political policies, and Kenya's dominant economic position.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. In this thesis, {{the effects of}} the Customs Union with the EU are {{analyzed}} for the case of Turkey, using unbalanced panel data sets consisting of more than 150 countries between 1980 - 2001. Liberalization of Turkish foreign trade has gained an irrevocable momentum with the realization of substantial adjustments to the <b>Common</b> <b>Custom</b> <b>Tariff</b> System with the European Union (EU). On 6 March 1995, the European Union and Turkey signed agreement on Customs Union (CU). Turkey’s tariffs and levies on imports of manufactured products from the European Union were eliminated by this agreement. Our empirical analysis involves estimating the effects on exports and imports of Turkey of the Customs Union Agreement (CUA), of changes in price, and income, and of economic crises, controlling for additional institutional variables. Our results indicate that the CUA has not only positively impacted on Turkey’s trade, but has also led to changes in the behavior of both exports and imports with regards to their responsiveness to underlying variables. We observe that the income elasticity of both exports and imports are generally lower for the CU period, the effect of the real exchange rate (RER) on Turkey’s exports is stronger for the EU countries after CU. However, real exchange rate changes cease to {{have a significant impact on}} imports after the CUA. Üngör, MuratM. S...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reform of}} the external tariff initiated by the CEMAC and the WAEMU that is aimed at reinforcing their economic integration. Overall, there is broad compliance with the streamlined and moderate rates, but with significant deviations from the harmonized paths in several countries. WAMZ countries, except Ghana, need to undertake major reforms in order to align their external tariff structures {{with that of the}} WAEMU as planned for 2007. To promote full compliance with the harmonized external tariff policies, the paper suggests, measures need to be taken, including the creation of financial incentives, at the regional and country levels.

40|$|Russia {{is shown}} to {{have every reason to}} seek special {{consideration}} of, as well as express its concerns over, the impact of the European Union's (EU) eastern enlargement. The latter relate, in particular, to the current and expected negative repercussions of the changes in the political and economic situation in Europe. Closer study of crucial EU enlargement issues arising {{as a result of the}} new member states (NMS) having shifted to the EU <b>common</b> <b>customs</b> <b>tariffs</b> and preferential systems, their adoption of the EU foreign trade regime and the standardization of cargo transit rules and regulations applicable across the EU- 25 as a whole demonstrate the need for a comprehensive approach to EU enlargement. That would make for a better understanding of the multifaceted and controversial impact that enlargement will have on the economic transition and industrial restructuring processes in Russia. As the EU penetrates more deeply into the markets of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia's share in bilateral and multilateral trade as well as other joint economic activities could be reduced still further. Russia is trying to promote its own specific vision of European integration based on two pillars the European Union in the West and Russia-initiated integration models in the East (e. g. a Single Economic Space). By taking that route, Russia could retain its political and economic influence in those post-Soviet European countries, where its strategic interests lie. The EU subscribes to a markedly different approach. In late 2002 it began pursuing its European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) that was specifically aimed at the eastern neighbours of the enlarged EU. It has demonstrated its growing political and economic engagement with those CIS member states that are now part of the ENP. The ENP transmits a clear message to Russia; it clearly signals the European Union’s specific interests and objectives in Eastern Europe. The policy is quite explicit; it reveals that the EU intends to discuss all issues directly with the counties concerned, while the mediation of Moscow is totally or mostly ignored. As a result, a conflict of interest is becoming increasingly apparent in Eastern Europe, with the EU adhering to its ENP and Russia promoting its integration model. Numerous indicators of the state of relations between Russia and the EU show that however important it may be, economic cooperation is increasingly fraught with ambiguity and competition, which, in the final analysis, can but have a negative impact on the efficiency of that joint relationship. economic restructuring, trade integration, EU–Russia relations, Russia, EU enlargement...|$|R

This paper outlines the progression of key reform and modernization initiatives in these countries since the early 1990 s, and assesses the gap between these reforms and those of more modern Customs agencies.

The findings also have implications on the design of reform programs and focus of potential technical assistance for the outstanding reform agenda.
