5|$|After calling {{time on his}} Forest career, Mills {{was once}} again on the move, this time to Forest's {{neighbours}} Notts County on 14 August 1987. His debut <b>came</b> <b>one</b> day after joining, starting County's 4–4 home draw with Wigan Athletic on {{the opening day of}} the 1987–88 Third Division. He first scored for County with their opening goal in a 2–1 away win over Chester City on 3 October 1987. Mills played in all of County's matches in 1987–88, making 60 appearances and scoring five goals, and was named the club's Player of the Year. County reached the Southern Area final of the Associate Members' Cup, being beaten 4–1 on aggregate by Wolverhampton Wanderers. With County finishing fourth in the table they qualified for the Third Division play-offs, in which they were beaten 4–2 on aggregate by Walsall in the semi-final. He missed only three matches while a County player in 1988–89, making 36 appearances and scoring four goals.|$|E
5|$|As the {{prestige}} of winning the Cup grew, so did the need to attract top players. Only nine months after winning the Cup, in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a resolution {{at the annual meeting}} of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time, the Cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams. The first professional competition <b>came</b> <b>one</b> month later during the Wanderers' two-game, total goals challenge series, which they won 17goals to 5.|$|E

He {{then returned to the}} Segunda Divisão with Gondomar and he made his debut on 31 January 2010 in a 2–0 win against Vieira. His first goal for the club <b>came</b> <b>one</b> week later in a 4–4 draw with Espinho. Mendes scored his second goal in a 2–1 win against Padroense. He made 12 league appearances in the 2009–10 season, scoring twice, as they finished 4th in the table. Having lost his place in the team during the 2010–11 season – making one league appearance – Mendes left Gondomar {{at the end of the}} campaign and subsequently retired from playing.|$|E

25|$|Southern Native American culture (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Seminole) is the {{cornerstone}} of southern cuisine.

Corn was used to make all kinds of dishes, from the familiar cornbread and grits, to liquors such as moonshine and whiskey (which is still important to the Southern economy).|$|E

25|$|With {{very large}} pedigrees or with very dense genetic marker data, such as from whole-genome sequencing, it is {{possible}} to precisely locate recombinations. With this type of genetic analysis, a meiosis indicator is assigned to each position of the genome for each meiosis in a pedigree. The indicator indicates which copy of the parental chromosome contributes to the transmitted gamete at that position. For example, if the allele from the 'first' copy of the parental chromosome is transmitted, a '0' might be assigned to that meiosis. If the allele from the 'second' copy of the parental chromosome is transmitted, a '1' would be assigned to that meiosis. The two alleles in the parent <b>came,</b> <b>one</b> each, from two grandparents. These indicators are then used to determine identical-by-descent (IBD) states or inheritance states, which are in turn used to identify genes responsible for diseases.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives won {{a convincing}} {{majority}} at the 1959 general election, increasing their lead over their nearest rivals, Labour. The Labour party were further weakened by internal disputes, but the Conservatives' economic policies unveiled in the 1960 Budget proved damaging. The tax cuts of 1959 were reversed, decreasing the government's popularity while the Liberals began a revival. The Conservatives {{were forced into}} third place in several by-elections, culminating {{in the loss of}} the previously safe seat of Orpington (neighbouring Macmillan's Bromley seat) in a March 1962 by-election victory for the Liberal candidate, Eric Lubbock. The by-election result, announced on 14 March, <b>came</b> <b>one</b> day after the Blackpool North by-election, another former Conservative safe seat; though the Conservative candidate Norman Miscampbell succeeded in holding the Blackpool North seat, the previous majority of 15,587 was reduced to just 973 by the Liberal candidate, Harry Hague. The Conservatives were struggling with deep unpopularity over their economic policies. A pay-pause and rising prices, together with discontent at high taxation that was demonstrably inequitable, drove voters to protest against government policies by switching their votes to the Liberals, or by abstaining from voting Conservative.|$|E
25|$|The Buccaneers, {{playing with}} the goal of keeping the Kansas City Chiefs’ Wing-T offense on the bench as much as possible, held them to little more than half of their regular rushing average. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers’ offense had their most {{productive}} day ever, setting a team record with three fourth-quarter touchdowns. Jimmy DuBose ran for two touchdowns and Louis Carter for one, and Doug Williams threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Morris Owens. Kansas City was held to a pair of Jan Stenerud field goals for most of the game. A fourth-quarter Tony Adams pass was ruled a touchdown, although replays showed that receiver Henry Marshall failed to keep both of his feet inbounds. Richard Wood was given much of the credit for stifling the Chiefs’ league-leading rushing attack. Wood correctly expected that Chiefs offensive coordinator Tom Pagna would run the offense straight at him, as he did when Wood played at USC and Pagna coached at Notre Dame. Pagna assumed incorrectly that the undersized Wood would be overpowered, but Wood instead responded by making 12 tackles. This was the Buccaneers’ third consecutive road win, and <b>came</b> <b>one</b> day after the Kansas City Royals were eliminated from the American League pennant race.|$|E

25|$|The Galaxy again {{finished}} {{first in the}} Western Conference in 1999, with a final record of 20–12, with a win in the CONCACAF Champions Cup, but they lost to D.C. United again 2–0. The 2000 season had the Galaxy in second in the Western Division, at 14–10–8. Despite this, they lost to the Kansas City Wizards after a tied aggregate and a sudden death game. 2001 was another successful year for Los Angeles, winning the Open Cup and scoring 1,000 all-time points, and with Cobi Jones scoring the 300th goal, but again they fell short by being defeated by Landon Donovan and the San Jose Earthquakes. Again the club clinched first in the Western Conference with a 16–9–3 record, their fifth time being first. In 2002, the Galaxy won their first MLS Cup in four tries by defeating the New England Revolution 1–0. 2003 was a poor year, with LA finishing fourth because {{they were forced to}} play away games due to stadium construction, though they got a good rhythm and finished 9–12–9. The Galaxy bounced back by gaining second with an 11–9–10 record. They lost to the Wizards in the final, 0–2. With 2005 <b>came</b> <b>one</b> of the Galaxy's most recognized players, Landon Donovan. The club won the Open Cup again ending with a record of 13–13–6 to cap off their first decade. The Galaxy has a distinction of making the playoffs in all of the league's first ten seasons.|$|E
25|$|In {{their first}} ever NBL game on 6 March 2010, at Stadium Southland, the Sharks faced the Hawke's Bay Hawks {{in front of}} 1,500 fans. Their {{starters}} Martin Iti, James Paringatai, René Rougeau, Mike Rose and Daniel Munday all put up strong performances, with Munday scoring the team's first basket. After 40 minutes, the teams could not be separated, with the scores locked at 84-all. With an overtime period needed, the Hawks came out victorious, winning 105–90. After losing their next game 96–82 away from home to the Harbour Heat at the North Shore Events Centre, the Sharks took revenge against first-up opponents, Hawke's Bay, to achieve their first ever win. After their first win, they were bought back down to earth as they were thrashed by 44 points by the Wellington Saints. After seven games, Mike Helms replaced Rose as the Sharks' second import. The Sharks left themselves {{in a good position}} to reach the playoffs {{for the first time in}} their first season as they only needed to win two of four away games to end the season. Their away trip began with the Sharks losing in overtime to the second-placed Waikato Pistons at Hamilton Boys' High School. They then <b>came</b> <b>one</b> win closer to the playoffs with a win against the Taranaki Mountainairs. A loss to the Nelson Giants saw the Sharks needing to beat the lowly Manawatu Jets in their regular season finale. With a 96–88 win over the Jets, the Sharks claimed sixth spot and booked themselves a playoff berth. They went on to lose in their quarter-final match-up to the Nelson Giants, 82–67, ending their inaugural season in the NBL. Centre Martin Iti earned Rookie of the Year honours, while import swingman René Rougeau was named to the All-Star Five.|$|E
