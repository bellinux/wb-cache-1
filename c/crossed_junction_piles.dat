VIP movement often cause chaos {{or in the}} worst case accident at <b>cross</b> <b>junctions.</b> Traffic quantity, waiting time and siren intensity are the inputs to the system. The fuzzy logic tool box in Matlab 7. 0 was used to simulate the system.

40|$|Detailed KK-factors {{measured}} for a symmetrical nonreducing steel <b>cross</b> <b>junction</b> {{were published}} in this journal in 2010. This article describes a variable KK-factor model for <b>cross</b> <b>junctions</b> that {{can take advantage of}} the published data and be incorporated into most existing hydraulic simulation software. The raw data are transformed and represented with bicubic spline surfaces. Newton’s method is used to solve the system of equations resulting from linearization of the equations. Despite the variable junction KK-factors, solutions converge quadratically or nearly so. For each iteration step, flow patterns must be detected, cross legs identified, and KK-factors updated. Inherent complexity of flow through <b>cross</b> <b>junctions</b> creates challenges: KK-factor surfaces have steep gradients and the values are often negative, branches with laminar flow occur alongside branches with turbulent flow, and flow stoppage is recurrent. In addition to comparing solutions based on constant and variable KK-factors, intriguing flow phenomena are highlighted and suggested as research topics. An important application of the methods presented in this article is validation of hydraulic simulation software. Read More: [URL]...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a general experimental approach yielding the entire transmission matrix of a multiprobe mesoscopic conductor. Results are presented for several new investigations with ballistic semiconductor nanostructures enabled by this technique. We measure the transmission coefficients {{for an open}} <b>cross</b> <b>junction</b> employing a sample design which is an almost literal realization of the Landauer-Büttiker model and verify that these transmission coefficients are consistent with Hall and bend resistance anomalies obtained by resistance measurements at low magnetic fields. Other investigations utilize a pinched <b>cross</b> <b>junction</b> in which two of the probes are separated from the channel by quantum point contacts. This series arrangement of point contacts allows a sensitive momentum spectroscopy of the emitted distribution. Even {{in the case of}} a single propagating mode, through the constrictions we observe modal features in the outgoing distribution. This indicates that the potential is spatially nonadiabatic even though conductance quantization is observed. This pinched geometry also allows the first fully characterized realization of weakly coupled probes...|$|R
