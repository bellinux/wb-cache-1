5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by <b>clamping</b> the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient <b>clamping</b> force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{stabilisation}} policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev, and <b>clamping</b> down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev had supported the leader's denunciations of Stalin's arbitrary rule, {{the rehabilitation of}} many of the victims of Stalin's purges, and the cautious liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy. But as soon as he became leader, Brezhnev began to reverse this process, and developed an increasingly conservative and regressive attitude.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by tonnage, which expresses the amount of <b>clamping</b> force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. Tonnage can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp tonnage to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher <b>clamping</b> force.|$|E
40|$|<b>Clamp</b> loaders load {{ring-shaped}} sliding <b>clamps</b> onto DNA. Once {{loaded onto}} DNA, sliding <b>clamps</b> bind to DNA polymerases {{to increase the}} processivity of DNA synthesis. To load <b>clamps</b> onto DNA, an open <b>clamp</b> loader-clamp complex must form. An unresolved question is whether <b>clamp</b> loaders capture <b>clamps</b> that have transiently opened or whether <b>clamp</b> loaders bind closed <b>clamps</b> and actively open <b>clamps.</b> A simple fluorescence-based <b>clamp</b> opening assay was developed {{to address this question}} and to determine how ATP binding contributes to <b>clamp</b> opening. A direct comparison of real time binding and opening reactions revealed that the Escherichia coli γ complex binds β first and then opens the <b>clamp.</b> Mutation of conserved “arginine fingers” in the γ complex that interact with bound ATP decreased <b>clamp</b> opening activity showing that arginine fingers make an important contribution to the ATP-induced conformational changes that allow the <b>clamp</b> loader to pry open the <b>clamp...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractReplication {{machines}} use ring-shaped <b>clamps</b> that encircle DNA {{to tether}} the polymerase to the chromosome. The <b>clamp</b> is assembled on DNA by a <b>clamp</b> loader. This report {{shows that the}} polymerase and <b>clamp</b> loader coordinate their actions with the <b>clamp</b> by competing for it through overlapping binding sites. The competition is modulated by DNA. In the absence of DNA, the <b>clamp</b> associates with the <b>clamp</b> loader. But after the <b>clamp</b> is placed on DNA, the polymerase develops a tight grip on the <b>clamp</b> and out-competes the <b>clamp</b> loader. After replication of the template, the polymerase looses affinity for the <b>clamp.</b> Now the <b>clamp</b> loader regains access to the <b>clamp</b> and removes it from DNA thus recycling it for future use...|$|R

5|$|The cost of <b>clamping</b> down on {{the protests}} was a loss of legitimacy, and the {{emergence}} of Amin al-Hafiz as the first Ba'athist military strongman. The traditional elite, consisting of the upper classes, who had been overthrown from political power by the Ba'athists, felt threatened by the Ba'ath Party's socialist policies. The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was a historical rival of the Syrian Regional Branch, and it felt threatened by the party's secular nature. Akram al-Hawrani and his supporters and the Syrian Communist Party opposed the one-party system which the Ba'ath Party was establishing.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by <b>clamping</b> the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed from the machine and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E
5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} lipid bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the lipid bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing lipid bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch <b>clamping</b> system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} lipid bilayer membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs.

40|$|The sliding <b>clamps</b> of {{chromosomal}} replicases are {{acted upon}} {{by both the}} <b>clamp</b> loader and DNA polymerase. Several other proteins and polymerases also interact with the <b>clamp.</b> These proteins bind the <b>clamp</b> at the same spot and use it in sequential fashion. First the <b>clamp</b> loader must bind the <b>clamp</b> in order to load it onto DNA, but directly thereafter the <b>clamp</b> loader must clear away from the <b>clamp</b> {{so it can be}} used by the replicative DNA polymerase. At the end of replication, the replicase is ejected from the <b>clamp,</b> which presumably allows the <b>clamp</b> to interact with yet other proteins after its use by the replicase. This paper describes how different proteins in the Escherichia coli replicase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, coordinate their traffic flow on the <b>clamp.</b> The mechanism by which traffic flow on the beta <b>clamp</b> is directed is based on competition of the proteins for the <b>clamp,</b> where DNA structure modulates the competition. It seems likely that the principles will generalize to a traffic flow of other factors on these circular <b>clamp</b> proteins...|$|R
5000|$|Sliding <b>clamps</b> {{are loaded}} onto their {{associated}} DNA template strands by specialized proteins known as [...] "sliding <b>clamp</b> loaders", which also disassemble the <b>clamps</b> after replication has completed. The binding {{sites for the}}se initiator proteins overlap with the binding sites for the DNA polymerase, so the <b>clamp</b> cannot simultaneously associate with a <b>clamp</b> loader and with a polymerase. Thus the <b>clamp</b> will not be actively disassembled while the polymerase remains bound. DNA <b>clamps</b> also associate with other factors involved in DNA and genome homeostasis, such as nucleosome assembly factors, Okazaki fragment ligases, and DNA repair proteins. All of these proteins also share a binding site on the DNA <b>clamp</b> that overlaps with the <b>clamp</b> loader site, ensuring that the <b>clamp</b> will not be removed while any enzyme is still working on the DNA. The activity of the <b>clamp</b> loader requires ATP hydrolysis to [...] "close" [...] the <b>clamp</b> around the DNA.|$|R
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} {{consists of}} the high pressure injection of the raw material into a mould which shapes the polymer into the desired shape. Moulds can be of a single cavity or multiple cavities. In multiple cavity moulds, each cavity can be identical and form the same parts or can be unique and form multiple different geometries during a single cycle. Moulds are generally made from tool steels, but stainless steels and aluminium moulds are suitable for certain applications. Aluminium moulds are typically ill-suited for high volume production or parts with narrow dimensional tolerances, as they have inferior mechanical properties and {{are more prone to}} wear, damage, and deformation during the injection and <b>clamping</b> cycles; however, aluminium moulds are cost-effective in low-volume applications, as mould fabrication costs and time are considerably reduced. Many steel moulds are designed to process well over a million parts during their lifetime and can cost {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to fabricate.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, serious {{divisions}} {{emerged in}} the Jordanian state over reactions to the Eisenhower Doctrine, which ostensibly aimed to stem Soviet expansion in the Middle East, but was viewed by Arab nationalists as a neo-colonialist ploy to control the region. Nabulsi and Foreign Minister Abdullah Rimawi, a Baathist, led the camp opposing the doctrine {{as a threat to}} Arab sovereignty and as means to control the region's oil assets and support Israel, while Hussein publicly embraced the doctrine as a preventive measure against growing communist influence in the country. Prior to these disagreements, Nabulsi had been <b>clamping</b> down on communist literature and influence in the press (the communists were generally opposed by Arab nationalists), whilst attempting to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union (USSR) without Hussein's knowledge. To that end, he dispatched Abu Nuwar to Moscow in February 1957 to serve as an initial contact with the Soviets. Later, Nabulsi publicly declared his intention to establish relations with the USSR and pursue a political union with Egypt and Syria, and requested from Hussein a confirmation of his dismissal of several royalist officials. Hussein responded by forcing Nabulsi to resign on 10 April 1957.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Interior Minister Nito Alves {{had become a}} {{powerful}} member of the MPLA government. Alves had successfully put down Daniel Chipenda's Eastern Revolt and the Active Revolt during Angola's War of Independence. Factionalism within the MPLA became a major challenge to Neto's power by late 1975 and Neto gave Alves the task of once again <b>clamping</b> down on dissent. Alves shut down the Cabral and Henda Committees while expanding his influence within the MPLA through his control of the nation's newspapers and state-run television. Alves visited the Soviet Union in October 1976, and may have obtained Soviet support for a coup against Neto. By the time he returned, Neto had grown suspicious of Alves' growing power and sought to neutralize him and his followers, the Nitistas. Neto called a plenum meeting of the Central Committee of the MPLA. Neto formally designated the party as Marxist-Leninist, abolished the Interior Ministry (of which Alves was the head), and established a Commission of Enquiry. Neto used the commission to target the Nitistas, and ordered the commission to issue a report of its findings in March 1977. Alves and Chief of Staff José Van-Dunem, his political ally, began planning a coup d'état against Neto.|$|E

5|$|The gray wolf's {{expressive}} {{behavior is}} more complex than that of the coyote and golden jackal, as necessitated by its group living and hunting habits. While less gregarious canids generally possess simple repertoires of visual signals, wolves have more varied signals that subtly inter grade in intensity. When neutral, the legs are not stiffened, the tail hangs down loosely, the face is smooth, the lips untensed, and the ears point in no particular direction. Postural communication in wolves consists of a variety of facial expressions, tail positions and piloerection. Aggressive, or self-assertive wolves are characterized by their slow and deliberate movements, high body posture and raised hackles, while submissive ones carry their bodies low, sleeken their fur and lower their ears and tail. When a breeding male encounters a subordinate family member, it may stare at it, standing erect and still with the tails horizontal to its spine. Two forms of submissive behavior are recognized: passive and active. Passive submission usually occurs as a reaction to the approach of a dominant animal, and consists of the submissive wolf lying partly on its back and allowing the dominant wolf to sniff its anogenital area. Active submission occurs often as a form of greeting, and involves the submissive wolf approaching another in a low posture, and licking the other wolf's face. When wolves are together, they commonly indulge in behaviors such as nose pushing, jaw wrestling, cheek rubbing and facial licking. The mouthing of each other's muzzles is a friendly gesture, while <b>clamping</b> on the muzzle with bared teeth is a dominance display.|$|E

5000|$|The clover <b>clamp,</b> also {{referred}} to as a [...] "butterfly clamp", is of Japanese design and provides increasing tension if pulled. The <b>clamp</b> itself is flat, about 5 cm by 10 cm (2 by 4 in) in size. The <b>clamp</b> is applied to the nipple and the spring tension holds the <b>clamp</b> in place. The <b>clamp</b> usually provides a very high pain level, and is usually only used by more advanced users. To increase tension on the nipples, small weights such as fishing line sinkers can be attached {{to the ends of the}} <b>clamp.</b> As increased pulling tension is applied to the <b>clamp,</b> it will cause the jaws of the <b>clamp</b> to close tighter, depending on the amount of pull pressure. Another method is to use the <b>clamps</b> to keep a person in one place. If cord is tied from the <b>clamp</b> to a fixed place, the wearer of the <b>clamps</b> cannot move away because the <b>clamps</b> will tighten as they move.

25|$|A Cochrane review {{suggests}} that active management (use of uterotonic drugs, cord <b>clamping</b> and controlled cord traction) {{during the third}} stage of labour reduces severe bleeding and anemia. However, the review also found that active management increased the mother's blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and pain. In the active management group more women returned to hospital with bleeding after discharge, {{and there was also}} a reduction in birthweight due to infants having a lower blood volume. The effects on the baby of early cord <b>clamping</b> was discussed in another review which found that delayed cord <b>clamping</b> improved iron stores longer term in the infants. Although {{they were more likely to}} need phototherapy (light therapy) to treat jaundice, the improved iron stores are expected to be worth increasing the practice of delayed cord <b>clamping</b> in healthy term babies. For preterm babies (babies born before 37 weeks) a review of the research found that delaying cord <b>clamping</b> by 30–45 seconds increased the amount of blood flow to the baby. This is important as increased blood volume in the baby made them less likely to develop some serious complications.
