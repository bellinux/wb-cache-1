5000|$|<b>Carprofen,</b> marketed under many {{brand names}} worldwide, is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) that veterinarians prescribe as a supportive treatment for various conditions in animals.

50|$|<b>Carprofen</b> {{was used}} in humans for almost 10 years, {{starting}} in 1988. It {{was used for the}} same conditions as in dogs, viz., joint pain and inflammation. Side effects tended to be mild, usually consisting of nausea or gastro-intestinal pain and diarrhea. <b>Carprofen</b> was available only by prescription in 150 to 600 mg doses. Dosage over 250 mg was only for relieving pain after severe trauma, such as post-surgery inflammation. 150 mg doses were commonly used to relieve the pain of arthritis, while 200 mg doses were commonly prescribed in cases of severe arthritis or severe inflammation pain. The drug was taken orally. Pfizer voluntarily removed it from the market for human use on commercial grounds.|$|E
5000|$|Several NSAIDs {{have been}} found to be harmful to {{scavenging}} birds. Diclofenac, <b>carprofen,</b> flunixin, ibuprofen and phenylbutazone were associated with mortality. Meloxicam has thus far been found to be [...] "Vulture-Safe" [...] and its use in veterinary treatment of livestock is being encouraged.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{consists}} of combinations of crate confinement and courses of anti-inflammatory medications (steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like <b>carprofen</b> and meloxicam), or chronic pain medications, like tramadol.

Furthermore, the grimacing indicates that buprenorphine is fully efficacious at recommended doses against early postoperative pain, but <b>carprofen</b> and ketoprofen are efficacious only at doses much higher than currently recommended: acetaminophen is not efficacious.|$|E
50|$|Although {{its name}} {{does not suggest}} {{similarity}} with propionic acid derivatives (e.g., ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, <b>carprofen,</b> etc.), ketorolac is an isostere of ketoprofen. More precisely, it is a derivative of dihydropyrrolizine carboxylic acid structurally related to indomethacin. NSAIDs are not recommended for use with other NSAIDs {{because of the potential}} for additive side effects. The protein-binding effect of most non-aspirin NSAIDs are inhibited by the presence of aspirin in the blood.|$|E

50|$|Phenylbutazone is {{occasionally}} used in {{dogs for}} the longer-term management of chronic pain, particularly due to osteoarthritis.

The margin of safety for all NSAIDs is narrow in the dog, and other NSAIDs are more commonly used (etodolac, and <b>carprofen).</b> Gastrointestinal-protectant drugs, such as misoprostol, cimetidine, omeprazole, ranitidine, or sucralfate, are frequently included as a part of treatment with any NSAID. Dogs receiving chronic phenylbutazone therapy should be followed with regular blood work and renal monitoring.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{broilers}} find walking painful, {{as indicated}} by studies using analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs.

5000|$|The {{symptoms}} of Shar Pei fever include fever, swelling, and {{pain in the}} hocks that usually resolves within two days. The swelling in the hocks is easily recognizable—the hock will resemble a flaccid waterballoon, rather than stiff swelling following a sprain or break. The symptoms can be treated with NSAIDs such as <b>carprofen.</b> Kidney and liver failure cannot be treated except by the conventional manner usually used for those diseases. Prevention of amyloidosis is sometimes used in dogs with recurring episodes of Shar Pei fever. Colchicine and dimethyl sulfoxide are most commonly used. [...] Dogs taking colchicine must be monitored closely for signs of bone marrow disease. The prognosis is guarded for Shar Pei that develop amyloidosis. Discuss the use of colchicine with your vet. It {{may not be the}} best solution, as it can have multiple side effects.|$|E
50|$|To {{assess the}} {{capacity}} of other species to consciously suffer pain we resort to argument-by-analogy. That is, if an animal responds to a stimulus the way a human does, {{it is likely to}} have had an analogous experience. If we stick a pin in a chimpanzee's finger and she rapidly withdraws her hand, we use argument-by-analogy and infer that like us, she felt pain. It might be argued that consistency requires us infer, also, that a cockroach experiences conscious pain when it writhes after being stuck with a pin. The usual counter-argument is that although the physiology of consciousness is not understood, it clearly involves complex brain processes not present in relatively simple organisms. Other analogies have been pointed out. For example, when given a choice of foods, rats and chickens with clinical symptoms of pain will consume more of an analgesic-containing food than animals not in pain. Additionally, the consumption of the analgesic <b>carprofen</b> in lame chickens was positively correlated to the severity of lameness, and consumption resulted in an improved gait. Such anthropomorphic arguments face the criticism that physical reactions indicating pain may be neither the cause nor result of conscious states.|$|E
50|$|Cats with LUTD and {{especially}} those with reoccurring FIC may benefit from environmental enrichment. Environmental enrichment includes changing {{of the type of}} litter used and maintaining a clean area for the litter boxes. The “1+1” rule for multiple cat owners is highly advised, where the house has a litter box for each cat they own, plus an additional one. If cats have urinated outside of the litter box in inappropriate places, thorough cleaning of the area is advised to reduce the interest of other cats. Placing litter boxes in areas of low noise and traffic and away from other pets is also suggested. Mimicking natural behavior for a cat with chronic stress helps them relax. They benefit from “hide and seek” games with their food, where they are “hunting” in their environment. Placing scratch posts or raised walkways where they can retreat and hide increases their sense of security and familiarity of the area. The use of laser pointers and toys to increase their exercise levels is also advisable, as obese and sedentary cats seem to be at higher risk for the development of LUTD and FIC. Cats that are particularly sensitive to their environment require a strict routine with minimal environmental changes. For instance, owners can inadvertently stress their cats out with their own emotional displays or changes in their routines. The use of simulated feline facial pheromone can reduce the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and reduce stress through a sense of familiarity. Lastly, anti-inflammatory drugs such as <b>carprofen</b> may be prescribed to reduce pain. Amitriptyline, an antidepressant, has also shown benefits but needs further research.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{analgesic}} {{efficacy of}} preoperative versus postoperative administration of <b>carprofen</b> and to determine, if preincisional mepivacaine epidural anesthesia improves postoperative analgesia in dogs treated with <b>carprofen.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Blind, randomized clinical study. ANIMALS: Dogs with femoral (n= 18) or pelvic (27) fractures. METHODS: Dogs were grouped by restricted randomization into 4 groups: group 1 = <b>carprofen</b> (4 mg/kg subcutaneously) immediately before induction of anesthesia, no epidural anesthesia; group 2 = <b>carprofen</b> immediately after extubation, no epidural anesthesia; group 3 = <b>carprofen</b> immediately before induction, mepivacaine epidural block 15 minutes before surgical incision; and group 4 = mepivacaine epidural block 15 minutes before surgical incision, <b>carprofen</b> after extubation. All dogs were administered <b>carprofen</b> (4 mg/kg, subcutaneously, once daily) for 4 days after surgery. Physiologic variables, nociceptive threshold, lameness score, pain, and sedation (numerical rating scale [NRS], visual analog scale [VAS]), plasma glucose and cortisol concentration, renal function, and hemostatic variables were measured preoperatively and {{at various times}} after surgery. Dogs with VAS pain scores > 30 were administered rescue analgesia. RESULTS: Group 3 and 4 dogs had significantly lower pain scores and amount of rescue analgesia compared with groups 1 and 2. VAS and NRS pain scores {{were not significantly different}} among groups 1 and 2 or among groups 3 and 4. There was no treatment effect on renal function and hemostatic variables. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative <b>carprofen</b> combined with mepivacaine epidural anesthesia had superior postoperative analgesia compared with preoperative <b>carprofen</b> alone. When preoperative epidural anesthesia was performed, preoperative administration of <b>carprofen</b> did not improve postoperative analgesia compared with postoperative administration of <b>carprofen.</b> CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Preoperative administration of systemic opioid agonists in combination with regional anesthesia and postoperative administration of <b>carprofen</b> provides safe and effective pain relieve in canine fracture repair...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the {{conductance}} and mannitol permeability of canine colonic mucosa in response to <b>carprofen</b> or 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (DNP) with or without tempol pretreatment. Ten colonic mucosa sections per dog were mounted in Ussing chambers. Treatments were done in duplicate. Mucosa was exposed to <b>carprofen</b> (200 μg/mL) or DNP (0. 25 mM), both with and without tempol (1 mM) pretreatment. Conductance was calculated every 15 min for 240 min. Mannitol flux was calculated over 3 consecutive 60 -minute periods. Histology or electron microscopy was done after exposure. Conductance over time, mannitol flux, frequency of histologic categories, and electron microscopic changes were analyzed for treatment effects. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) conductance over time for <b>carprofen</b> or DNP-treated colons was not significantly different from control regardless of tempol pretreatment. Period 3 mannitol fluxes for <b>carprofen</b> and DNP-treated colon were not significantly different, but were greater than control. Period 3 mannitol flux for tempol + <b>carprofen</b> was significantly less than tempol + DNP-treated colon. Sloughing of cells and erosions were seen in the mucosa of carprofen-treated colon. Mitochondrial damage was seen more often in carprofen-treated than DNP-treated or control colon. Tempol pretreatment resulted in more ruptured mitochondria in the carprofen-treated colon; however, other mitochondrial changes were not significantly affected by tempol pretreatment in either <b>carprofen</b> or DNP treated colon. Treatment with <b>carprofen</b> or DNP increased the mannitol flux, but pretreatment with tempol mitigated the <b>carprofen</b> effect. It is apparent that structural mitochondrial damage occurs in the canine colonic mucosa after <b>carprofen</b> and DNP exposure...|$|E
40|$|The renal {{clearance}} of the anti-Inflammatory agent, <b>carprofen,</b> was {{studied in the}} isolated perfused rat kidney (IPK).

40|$|BackgroundThe present {{preliminary}} study describes concentration time courses of the NSAID <b>carprofen</b> in the plasma and synovial fluid in a microfrature sheep model after transcutaneous treatments {{with a novel}} application device (Vetdrop®).

40|$|The authors {{examined}} {{the potential of}} the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2) inhibitor <b>carprofen</b> to reproducibly induce anastomotic leakage. In experiment 1, an anastomosis was constructed in both ileum and colon of 20 rats, and they were given <b>carprofen</b> (5 mg/kg subcutaneously every 24 hours) or buprenorphine (0. 02 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours). In another 20 rats an anastomosis was constructed in either ileum or colon, and all received <b>carprofen</b> (experiment 2). Animals were sacrificed after 3 days. In experiment 1, the ileal dehiscence rate was 60 % in the <b>carprofen</b> group and 0 % in the buprenorphine group (P =. 0108). Colonic anastomoses in both groups remained patent. In experiment 2, the anastomotic leakage rate was 80 % in ileum and 0 % in colon. Thus, COX- 2 inhibitors can severely interfere with intestinal healing, particularly in the ileum.

40|$|Whole {{blood in}} vitro assays {{were used to}} {{determine}} the potency and selectivity of <b>carprofen</b> enantiomers for inhibition of the isoforms of cyclooxygenase (COX), COX- 1 and COX- 2, in the calf. S(+) -carprofen possessed preferential activity for COX- 2 inhibition but, because the slopes of inhibition curves differed, the COX- 1 :COX- 2 inhibition ratio decreased from 9. 04 : 1 for inhibitory concentration (IC) 10 to 1. 84 : 1 for IC 95. R() <b>carprofen</b> inhibited COX- 2 preferentially only for low inhibition of the COX isoforms (IC 10 COX- 1 :COX- 2 = 6. 63 : 1), whereas inhibition was preferential for COX- 1 for a high level of inhibition (IC 95 COX- 1 :COX- 2 = 0. 20 : 1).

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{increasing}} evidence that perioperative use of NSAIDs may compromise {{the integrity of}} intestinal anastomoses. This study aims to characterize {{the negative effects of}} <b>carprofen</b> on early anastomotic healing in the rat ileum. Results In 159 male Wistar rats an anastomosis was constructed in the ileum. In experiment 1 eighty-four rats were divided over control and experimental groups, which received daily buprenorphine or <b>carprofen,</b> respectively, as an analgesic and were killed on day 1, 2 or 3 after surgery. In experiment 2 three groups of 15 rats received <b>carprofen</b> either immediately after surgery or with a delay of 1 or 2 days. Animals were killed after 3 days of <b>carprofen</b> administration. In experiment 3 three groups of 10 rats received different doses (full, half or quarter) of <b>carprofen</b> from surgery. In significant contrast to buprenorphine, which never did so, <b>carprofen</b> induced frequent signs of anastomotic leakage, which were already present at day 1. If first administration was delayed for 48 hours, the leakage rate was significantly reduced (from 80 to 20 %; p = 0. 0028). Throughout the study, the anastomotic bursting pressure was lowest in animals who displayed signs of anastomotic leakage. Loss of anastomotic integrity did not coincide with reduced levels of hydroxyproline or increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases. Conclusions <b>Carprofen</b> interferes with wound healing in the rat ileum at a very early stage. Although the mechanisms responsible remain to be fully elucidated, one {{should be aware of the}} potential of NSAIDs to interfere with the early phase of wound repair. </p...|$|E
