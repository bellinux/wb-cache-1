50|$|The Robert A. Thompson House {{is located}} along NY 302 in the Thompson Ridge {{section of the}} Orange County, New York, town of Crawford. It was built in 1822 in the Federal style. One of the stones in the {{northwest}} <b>cable</b> <b>bears</b> his initials and that date. His descendants established the Dutch-Belt dairy farm, which still operates.|$|R

There is a cable car adorned with several American flags resting on a track at left. At right, a large crowd full of women in white dresses has {{gathered}} to watch the ceremony. Down the street, more people have gathered on the sidewalks. There are several large buildings visible, as well as a large number of trees. The <b>cable</b> car <b>bears</b> the number 60...|$|R
5|$|Standard USB has {{a minimum}} rated {{lifetime}} of 1,500 cycles of insertion and removal, the mini-USB receptacle increases this to 5,000 cycles, and the newer Micro-USB and USB-C receptacles are both {{designed for a}} minimum rated lifetime of 10,000 cycles of insertion and removal. To accomplish this, a locking device was added and the leaf-spring was moved from the jack to the plug, so that the most-stressed part is on the cable side of the connection. This change was made so that the connector on the less expensive <b>cable</b> would <b>bear</b> the most wear.|$|R
50|$|Leighton {{did some}} TV comedy writing, {{including}} a CBS sitcom which was cancelled before his episode aired. He also wrote individual episodes for live action and animated <b>cable</b> shows including <b>Bear</b> in the Big Blue House, Cartoon Network's Ed, Edd N Eddy and Nickelodeon's The Off-Beats with creator Mo Willems.|$|R
40|$|The current prototype’s key {{contribution}} {{to the field of}} light-weight structures is that {{it is the first time}} that a pure tensegrity ring has been used in place of a compression ring. This design features a cladding structure for a sports arena, which consist of a ring-shaped outer section and a central roof structure. The ring-shaped outer section of the stadium consists of a tensegrity structure, which uses textile membranes in a place of conventional tension <b>cables</b> to <b>bear</b> the tensile forces occurring between the pressure elements. The supporting framework and spatial enclosure therefore become one an extension to the tension integrity principle. The central area of the roof is covered over by a Geiger dome, which in turn is a specific version of the tensegrity principle. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
60|$|Clearly the cable-man was right, for, {{while the}} {{picking-up}} apparatus was being got ready, the cable {{was cut in}} no fewer than three places, {{in order to test}} the coils that lay in the tanks. These being found all right, the picking-up was begun with anxious care. The moment of greatest danger was when the big ship was swinging round. For a few, but apparently endless, moments the <b>cable</b> had to <b>bear</b> the strain, and became rigid like a bar of steel. Then it was got in over the bows, where all was bustle, and noise, and smoke, as the picking-up machinery panted and rattled.|$|R
50|$|During routine inspections, bridge cables are {{unwrapped}} and wedges {{are used}} to separate the individual strands. Inspectors look for signs of moisture and corrosion throughout the cable. In the 1990s engineers experimented with several materials on a small section of the <b>cables</b> of the <b>Bear</b> Mountain Bridge. After a year the test areas were reexamined and one polymer-based, non-toxic paste material {{was found to be}} superior. The bridge cables were then rewrapped in 2000 using the material. The cables were found to be free of additional moisture or corrosion in a 2007 inspection. New York State Bridge Authority chief engineer William Moreau is hopeful that the new material will lengthen the life of the cables, and lower the need for inspection and maintenance.|$|R

Commercial {{buildings}} line {{either side of}} Third Street, which moves into the distance at left, while pedestrians can be seen making their way along the corner at the intersection with D Street at right. In the center of third street, a <b>cable</b> car, which <b>bears</b> a sign that reads "Base Line", has stopped and is picking up passengers.

5000|$|Several campsites usually share a <b>bear</b> <b>cable</b> {{away from}} the campsite. This is a metal cable strung between two sturdy trees at least ten feet above the ground; {{it is used to}} hang bear bags {{containing}} items that might attract animals.Campsites also share a latrine or toilet. Philmont latrines have the possibility of housing spiders below the seat, which is why campers are encouraged to remove possible pests {{on the underside of the}} boards with a stick. The latrines come in different configurations, but all of them are for excrement only, and are not to be urinated in, in order to reduce smell. The open-air style latrine with two adjacent seats is affectionately called the [...] "pilot to copilot" [...] design; this results from the joking conversation which often takes place between two campers using the toilet simultaneously. The other open-air configuration latrine, called the [...] "pilot to bombardier", is generally preferred because its two seats are back-to-back and offer somewhat more privacy than the [...] "pilot to copilot". Occasionally a [...] "single pilot" [...] - one open-air seat — may be found. The enclosed configuration, with walls and a red roof, is known as a Red Roof Inn, in joking reference to the hotel chain. Older Red Roof Inns contain two adjacent seats and no doors ("pilot to copilot"), while newer models have two back-to-back seats ("pilot to bombadier"), with a wall between. Portable toilets ("Time Machines") are rare in the backcountry and only found in places such as French Henry camp.|$|R
60|$|Among {{other tests}} {{to which the}} Great Eastern was {{subjected}} was the terrible storm of the 25th and 26th October of that year, (1859), in which the Royal Charter went down. She lay at anchor in the harbour of Holyhead during that storm. So fierce was the gale that {{a large part of}} the breakwater was destroyed, and several vessels went down inside the harbour, while some were driven on shore. For one hour the big ship was as near destruction as she is ever likely to be. Her salvation, under God, was due to the experience and energy of Captain Harrison and his officers. During the whole gale the captain was on the watch, sounding the lead to see if she dragged, and keeping the steam up to be in readiness to put to sea at a moment's notice. The gale roared and whistled through the rigging with indescribable fury. The captain, in trying to pass along the deck, was thrown down, and his waterproof coat was blown to ribbons. The cabin skylights were thrown open with a fearful crash, the glass broken, and deluges of rain and spray poured into the saloons. Two anchors were down, one seven tons, the other three, with eighty and sixty fathoms of chain respectively; but the ground was known to be bad, and the lee-shore rocky, while the waves came curling and writhing into harbour, straining the cables to the utmost, and dashing against the rocks like avalanches of snow. The dash of these billows on the breakwater was like the roar of artillery. All this time the red light at the end of the breakwater shone out cheerily in the midst of a turmoil of spray. At last masses of the timber-work and solid masonry gave way. The gale rose to its fiercest, and one huge billow came rolling in; it towered high above the breakwater; it fell, and the red light was seen no more. The danger was now imminent. The <b>cables</b> could evidently <b>bear</b> no more, and the gale was increasing; so the screw was set going, but the wreck of timber from the breakwater fouled it and brought it to a dead-lock. Then the wind veered round more to the north-east, sending a tremendous swell into the harbour, and the Great Eastern began to roll heavily. In this extremity the paddle engines were set going, and the ship was brought up to her anchors, one of which was raised for the purpose of being dropped in a better position. At this moment the cable of the other anchor parted, and the great ship drifted swiftly toward what seemed certain destruction; but the heavy anchor was let go, and the engines turned on full speed. She swung round head to wind, and was brought up. This was the turning-point. The gale slowly abated, and the Great Eastern was saved, while all round her the shores and harbour were strewn with wrecks.|$|R
