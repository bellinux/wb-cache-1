25|$|This is {{the most}} common type of drug-induced liver <b>cell</b> <b>necrosis</b> where the injury is largely {{confined}} to a particular zone of the liver lobule. It may manifest as a very high level of ALT and severe disturbance of liver function leading to acute liver failure.|$|E
25|$|In this pattern, {{hepatocellular}} necrosis {{is associated with}} infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug-induced hepatitis. (A) viral hepatitis is the most common, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. (B) in focal or non-specific hepatitis, scattered foci of <b>cell</b> <b>necrosis</b> may accompany lymphocytic infiltration. (C) chronic hepatitis {{is very similar to}} autoimmune hepatitis clinically, serologically, and histologically.|$|E

40|$|Experimental acute kidney injury (AKI) is {{accompanied}} {{by the death of}} renal tubule epithelial <b>cells,</b> <b>necrosis</b> and apoptosis of the terminal portion of the proximal tubule, and apoptosis in the distal nephron. While immune competent cells invading the kidney play a role in such cell death, intervention in these processes only partially ameliorates the extent of cell death.

25|$|It has {{roles in}} {{progression}} of the cell cycle, including cell death. GSH levels regulate redox changes to nuclear proteins necessary for the initiation of cell differentiation. Differences in GSH levels also determine the expressed mode of cell death, being either apoptosis or <b>cell</b> <b>necrosis.</b> Manageably low levels result in the systematic breakage of the cell whereas excessively low levels result in rapid cell death.|$|E

Acutely poisoned mice displayed anorexia, diarrhoea and gasping respiration. Autopsy results revealed haemorrhages in the lungs, livers, kidneys, small intestines and adrenal glands.

30|$|Alarmins {{represent}} {{nothing less}} that the missing molecular link between tissue injury and the inflammatory response to tissue suffering. Conceptually, alarmins should be molecules present inside of cells sheltered from the immune system, and only released during tissue injury, most probably during <b>cells</b> <b>necrosis</b> or plasma membrane rupture [21]. Indeed, {{it has been}} shown that cell death by apoptosis does not produce inflammation. In addition, receptors for these danger signals should exist in leukocytes, and possibly in other cell types sensing the presence of endogenous alarmins that have become extracellular.|$|R

25|$|UA {{may occur}} unpredictably at rest, {{which may be}} a serious {{indicator}} of an impending heart attack. What differentiates stable angina from unstable angina (other than symptoms) is the pathophysiology of the atherosclerosis. The pathophysiology of unstable angina is the reduction of coronary flow due to transient platelet aggregation on apparently normal endothelium, coronary artery spasms, or coronary thrombosis. The process starts with atherosclerosis, progresses through inflammation to yield an active unstable plaque, which undergoes thrombosis and results in acute myocardial ischemia, which, if not reversed, results in <b>cell</b> <b>necrosis</b> (infarction). Studies show that 64% of all unstable anginas occur between 22:00 and 08:00 when patients are at rest.|$|E
25|$|German {{scientist}} Karl Vogt {{was first}} to describe the principle of apoptosis in 1842. In 1885, anatomist Walther Flemming delivered a more precise description {{of the process of}} programmed cell death. However, it was not until 1965 that the topic was resurrected. While studying tissues using electron microscopy, John Foxton Ross Kerr at University of Queensland was able to distinguish apoptosis from traumatic cell death. Following the publication of a paper describing the phenomenon, Kerr was invited to join Alastair R. Currie, as well as Andrew Wyllie, who was Currie's graduate student, at University of Aberdeen. In 1972, the trio published a seminal article in the British Journal of Cancer. Kerr had initially used the term programmed <b>cell</b> <b>necrosis,</b> but in the article, the process of natural cell death was called apoptosis. Kerr, Wyllie and Currie credited James Cormack, a professor of Greek language at University of Aberdeen, with suggesting the term apoptosis. Kerr received the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize on March 14, 2000, for his description of apoptosis. He shared the prize with Boston biologist H. Robert Horvitz.|$|E
2500|$|It is not {{surprising}} that ROS production may be a form of chemical defense against predators, since at low levels it can damage DNA and at high levels lead to <b>cell</b> <b>necrosis.</b> [...] One of the most common mechanisms of cellular injury is the reaction of ROS with lipids, which can disrupt enzyme activity and ATP production, and lead to apoptosis. [...] Reactions of ROS with proteins can modify amino acids, fragment peptide chains, alter electrical charges, and ultimately inactivate an enzyme's function. In DNA, deletions, mutations, and other lethal genetic effects may result from reactions with ROS. Reactive oxygen species are especially inexpensive to produce as defense chemicals, simply because they are not composed of metabolically costly elements such as carbon, nitrogen, or phosphate. [...] Reactive oxygen species produced by phytoplankton have been linked to deaths of fish, shellfish, and protists, as well as shown to reduce the viability and growth of bacteria. In addition, a study by Marshall et al. showed that four algal species used as bivalve feed produced significantly lower concentrations of superoxide, suggesting that ROS production by other algal species may be a way to decrease grazing by bivalves. [...] The most direct evidence for ROS as a defense mechanism is the fact that many icthyotoxic algae produce greater concentrations of ROS than nonichthyotoxic strains.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the healing differences in between four different widely used suture materials in the oral surgery practice, including silk (Perma- Hand; Ethicon, INC., Somerville, NJ, USA), polypropylene (Prolene; Ethicon, INC., Somerville, NJ, USA), coated polyglactin 910 (Ethicon, INC., Somerville, NJ, USA). and polyglecaprone 25 (Ethicon, INC., Somerville, NJ, USA). Materials and Methods: 20 male rats were randomly allocated into two groups depending on their sacrification days (post-operative 1 st and the 7 th days). Four longitudinal incision wounds, each 1 cm in size, were created on the dorsum of each animal which were then primarily closed with four different types of sutures. Results: The effects of these suture materials on soft tissue healing were compared histopathologically, by means of density of the <b>cells,</b> <b>necrosis,</b> fibrosis, foreign body reaction, the presence of cells of acute and chronic infection. No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups regarding the density of the <b>cells,</b> <b>necrosis,</b> fibrosis, foreign body reaction, and the presence of the cells of acute & chronic infections. Of note, propylene showed slightly less tissue reaction among the other materials. Conclusion: The results of our study showed that there is no only one ideal suture material for surgical practice. The factors related to the patient, the type of the surgery and the quality of the tissue are important to decide an appropriate suture material...|$|R

40|$|Interferons {{enhance the}} {{cellular}} antiviral response by inducing expression of protective proteins. Many of these proteins are activated by dsRNA, a typical by-product of viral infection. Here {{we show that}} type-I and type-II interferons can sensitize cells to dsRNA-induced cytotoxicity. In caspase- 8 -or FADD-deficient Jurkat <b>cells</b> dsRNA induces <b>necrosis,</b> instead of apoptosis. In L 929 sA <b>cells</b> dsRNA-induced <b>necrosis</b> involves high reactive oxygen species production. The antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole protects <b>cells</b> from <b>necrosis,</b> but shifts the response to apoptosis. Treatment with the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-DL-Asp(OMe) -fluoromethylketone or overexpression ot Bcl- 2 prevent this shift and promote necrosis. Our results suggest that a single stimulus can initiate different death-signaling pathways, leading to either necroticor apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of key events in these signaling pathways, such as caspase activation, cytochrome c release or mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, tips the balance between necrosis and apoptoslis, leading to dominance {{of one of these}} death programs.

We discuss here a kinetic model and simulation results for cancer cells ablation by laser-activated nanoheaters. The effective therapeutic effect for cancer cell killing is achieved due to large damage area at the relatively low energy density of the incident laser pulse...|$|R
