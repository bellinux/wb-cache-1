40|$|Until recently, UK {{financial}} products {{markets have}} been free of price controls {{for a number}} of decades. However, the government has recently brought in caps on the cost of short-term <b>consumer</b> <b>finance</b> (payday <b>loans).</b> The government had previously rejected such price control for good reasons. The evidence from overseas suggests that restricting consumer credit can drive the market underground or lead vulnerable consumers to complete financial breakdown and thus make all credit and financial services difficult to access in the future. The UK government is also introducing controls on pensions charges. Again, this is happening after such controls were rejected and despite evidence that the market was working effectively. The government concedes that it is likely that price controls will inhibit new entry and competition in the industry. One government agency suggests that the price cap might become a ‘target’ for providers who might otherwise have priced their products lower than the cap. It is clear from the development of the charge capping agenda that the proposed regulation will be driven by political rather than economic consideration...|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{research}} on mortgage default in the single-family market {{has focused on}} the value of the borrower's put option using house price indices to estimate contemporaneous loan-to-value ratio or the probability of negative equity. But since the borrower possesses the option to increase leverage by taking on additional debt secured by junior liens subsequent to loan origination (a phenomenon termed here equity dilution), even a perfect house price adjustment cannot be expected to accurately measure changes in borrower equity over time. Since junior liens are generally unobservable to senior debt holders, proxies are required in empirical applications. This paper employs an independent estimate of junior lien probability developed from the 1998 Survey of <b>Consumer</b> <b>Finances</b> combined with <b>loan</b> level mortgage performance data to examine the role junior liens play in increasing default risk.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} financial position of payday borrowers using {{the most detailed}} nationally representative survey of American finances - the Survey of <b>Consumer</b> <b>Finances.</b> Payday <b>loans</b> are short term, unsecured loans generally less than five hundred dollars. Borrowers pay dearly for such loans, as fees are typically $ 15 for every $ 100 borrowed. Because the term for these loans is never more than two weeks, the annualized percentage rate is quite large ~ 390 %. For the first time, in 2007 the Survey of <b>Consumer</b> <b>Finances</b> included a question about use of payday loans, {{and so it is}} now possible to expand the analysis of payday borrowing beyond basic demographic information and income. 	Given these high costs, why would households choose this option for dealing with financial emergencies? I show that payday borrowing is driven more by a lack of resources, in particular available credit alternatives, rather than low incomes. In addition, budgeting is a significant factor. Another alternative that households often look to is financial support from friends and family. Access to financial support is driven by many of the same factors that make these households insecure. Nevertheless, I show "private safety nets" do indeed reduce payday borrowing. But network relations don't just entail receiving. The provision of financial support is correlated with overspending and increases the odds of payday borrowing. 	This dissertation makes several contributions to our understanding of payday borrowing. First, using the detailed data on savings and budgeting practices, it shows the importance of building resources to managing budgetary shortfalls. Second and relatedly, I show that borrowers have little financial alternatives - they are effectively shut out of credit markets, {{and at the same time}} their network relationships can be both a help and a hindrance for avoiding payday loans...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} experience of systemic restricted choice {{and its impact on}} self-concept among racial and ethnic minority <b>consumers</b> seeking <b>financing.</b> Choosing <b>loans</b> is an involved consumer choice journey, and encountering systemic, chronic, and uncontrollable restrictions on choice at any level of the goal/choice hierarchy limits and even prohibits minorities 2 ̆ 7 ability to make desired choices. Across a multimethod investigation, these three studies demonstrate that minorities experiencing systemic restricted choice endure deleterious impacts to self-concept, including framing the self as fettered, alone, discriminated, and subservient, as well as marked reductions in self-esteem, self-autonomy, and self-efficacy. Minority consumers also frame themselves as striving in a world of limited resources and fighting uphill, often losing battles. Juxtaposing the experiences of racial/ethnic minorities against the choice journeys of educationally and economically similar white consumers puts those minority experiences in sharp relief. The theoretical and transformative consumer research implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A household’s vehicle {{purchases}} {{are among}} its largest expenditure outlays. Moreover, unlike housing purchases, which a typical household may make {{once or twice}} over a lifetime, a household may well buy several cars over the same interval. The magnitude and relative frequency of vehicle purchases suggest that differential treatment by race in the vehicle market may {{have important implications for}} differences in wealth and financial wellbeing by race. Yet, whereas a robust literature in economics has studied virtually all aspects of racial treatment in the housing market, corresponding work about vehicles has been relatively sparse, with most work focusing on racial differences in prices paid (Pinelopi Goldberg (1996) and Fiona Scott-Morton, Florian Zettelmeyer, and Jorge Silva-Risso (2003)). Very little previous {{attention has been paid to}} whether there is differential racial treatment in another important outcome in the vehicle market: the interest rates that households pay on the loans used to purchase vehicles. 1 Calculations using data from the Survey of <b>Consumer</b> <b>Finances</b> indicate that <b>loans</b> for vehicle purchases are primarily obtained from one of two sources.

40|$|China {{is rapidly}} {{becoming}} the world’s largest consumer market. As {{the number of}} middle-class Chinese consumers has grown, so too has the size of China’s <b>consumer</b> <b>finance</b> system. To date, {{there has been little}} scholarship on <b>consumer</b> <b>finance</b> in China. This article takes a first step at filling this gap in the literature. It argues that China’s <b>consumer</b> <b>finance</b> system is fundamentally a tool of the state, which uses “financial repression” of Chinese consumers to acquire capital through shadow taxation. This political-legal system allows reallocation of consumers’ capital for political purposes and underwrites China’s rapid growth. But cheap consumer capital has primed the Chinese economy for an economic collapse by encouraging unsustainable asset bubbles. Ironically, this very problem makes it impossible for China to liberalize its <b>consumer</b> <b>finance</b> system, lest a shortage of easy capital precipitate a collapse. China’s elite are also against financial liberalization because it is not in their personal interest. Ultimately, meaningful liberalization of China’s <b>consumer</b> <b>finance</b> system is unlikely because change would require the type of political-legal liberalization which China’s government has been unwilling to pursu...|$|R
