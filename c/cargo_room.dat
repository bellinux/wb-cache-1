25|$|During 1936 Nordnorge was rebuilt at Trondhjems mekaniske Værksted. She had her hull {{extended}} by , making her a 991 gross register ton/556 net register ton ship. The Third Class section was moved amidships and expanded, and a refrigerated <b>cargo</b> <b>room</b> was added. The bridge was moved up one deck. Nordnorge was fitted with an echo sounder, an electric logbook and radio telephone.|$|E
25|$|The Sporting Type was {{designed}} to meet RAF specification number RAF XXXII. It was a four-seat, single-engined biplane with twin wooden floats mounted on wire-braced struts below the fuselage. It had two cockpits, the forward cockpit for the pilot and a passenger sitting in tandem, the other for two passengers sitting abreast; the rear cockpit could also function as <b>cargo</b> <b>room,</b> increasing the aircraft's operational flexibility. The fuselage was of semi-monocoque plywood construction with a fabric fairing.|$|E
25|$|At 11:30 PM on {{the evening}} of Saturday June 8, 1990, an {{explosion}} in the <b>cargo</b> <b>room</b> of the Norwegian oil tanker the Mega Borg “ruptured the bulkhead between the pump room and the engine room”, causing the ship to catch fire and begin to leak oil. The 853-foot-long, 15-year-old vessel was about 50 {{miles off the coast of}} Galveston, Texas when the explosion occurred. The weather at the time was calm and the tanker had easily passed Coast Guard safety inspections in April earlier that year. While the direct cause of the engine room explosion remains unknown, the initial blast occurred during a lightening process in which the Mega Borg was transferring oil onto a smaller Italian tanker, the Fraqmura, in order to then transport the oil to Houston. This transfer was necessary, as the Mega Borg was too large to dock at the Texas port. Three million gallons of the total 38 million gallons of light Angolan Palanca crude oil on board the tanker were able to be transferred to the Fraqmura before the blast.|$|E
2500|$|Various other {{functions}} {{are available in}} some <b>cargo</b> control <b>rooms.</b> [...] Many offer the person in charge additional monitoring and control systems, the ability to monitor inert gas systems, and tank pressures.

2500|$|<b>Cargo</b> control <b>rooms</b> {{began to}} appear on U.S.-flag tankers in the mid-1960s. [...] Prior to this time, valves were {{operated}} manually on deck by reach rods and liquid levels were monitored by a roving watch consisting of the mate and seamen on watch. [...] The use of computers in the <b>cargo</b> control <b>room</b> began in the 1980s.

25|$|The AL10 RX's new {{exterior}} styling adopts the L-finesse design language, {{and outer}} features include a rear spoiler which hides {{the rear window}} wiper and radio antenna creating a less cluttered appearance. The drag coefficient on the latest RX 350 {{has been reduced to}} 0.33 C'd. Exterior dimensions are increased, with <b>cargo</b> <b>room</b> increased by five percent over the prior generation. For the interior, major standard features include SmartAccess, a keyless entry and start system, electrochromic heated side mirrors, UV reducing exterior glass, Bluetooth, power tilt/telescoping steering wheel, power 10-way driver and passenger seats, sliding and reclining rear seats and a power rear hatch. The instrument cluster's multi-function display uses an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of a thin film transistor (TFT-LCD) display. New cabin technologies include VoiceBox Technologies conversational speech voice recognition system, {{the first of its kind}} in the U.S., which can recognize general speech commands. The new hard disk drive HDD-based navigation system no longer uses a touchscreen, instead replacing it with Lexus' Remote Touch controller, similar in function to a computer mouse, with haptic feedback. Optional accessory features include XM Satellite Radio, a 15-speaker 330-watt Mark Levinson Surround Sound audio system, a dual-screen Rear Seat Entertainment System (RSES), 19-inch wheels, heated and ventilated front seats, power front seat cushion extender, perforated and semi-aniline leather seats, a smog sensor for the HVAC system, power folding side view mirrors, and navigation system.

500|$|Jones, nicknamed [...] "Jonesy", is an American Shorthair {{who is the}} rodent-control ship's cat on the Nostromo. After {{the birth}} and escape of the Alien, Jones is {{detected}} by the crew and risks interfering with the ship's motion sensors (which could mistake the cat's movements for those of the Alien). Brett finds Jones in the <b>cargo</b> <b>room,</b> where the Alien kills Brett as Jones watches. When the remaining crew members prepare to escape the ship, Ripley loads Jones into a pet carrier but must temporarily abandon him as the Alien approaches her. The Alien inspects Jones but leaves him alone, since the cat poses no threat. Ripley retrieves Jones and flees {{with him on a}} shuttle. She and the cat are in cryosleep for fifty-seven years, until they are rescued. Jones remains Ripley's pet for the duration of her new employment until she departs on the Sulaco, leaving him behind. Four cats were used in Alien, with each exhibiting specific feline behaviors such as scampering and hissing. According to Ridley Scott's audio commentary on the Alien DVD, to capture Jones' fearful reaction to the Alien a screen was placed between the cat and a German Shepherd; when the screen between the animals was removed, the cat immediately hissed.|$|E
