40|$|This paper shows {{empirical}} evidence {{in favor of}} forward-looking household consumption [...] that consumption today depends directly on household-specific ex-ante expectations of <b>future</b> <b>income.</b> This analysis is unique in using a direct consumption measure combined with an ex-ante household-specific measure of expected <b>future</b> <b>income,</b> constructed from detailed survey and administrative data on Social Security, pensions, and retirement plans. Households with high expected <b>future</b> <b>income</b> spend more today than households that have lower <b>future</b> <b>income</b> but identical current income and net worth. Omitting household-specific <b>future</b> <b>income</b> can cause mis-estimation of key consumption questions. Furthermore, when all three resources for consumption (current income, net worth, and <b>future</b> <b>income)</b> are accounted for, the average propensity to spend out of current income is similar to predictions of optimal consumption under uncertainty in a dynamic stochastic model, although the propensities to spend out of accumulated net worth and expected <b>future</b> <b>income</b> are notably lower in the data than the optimal model. Finally, these data also provide evidence {{on the effect of}} risk on consumption while controlling for all three resources. Households with high measured risk aversion consume less out of <b>future</b> <b>income.</b> All households, on average, consume more out of the more predictable sources of <b>future</b> <b>income,</b> such as <b>future</b> Social Security benefits.

40|$|This paper tests a {{straightforward}} {{implication of the}} basic Life Cycle model of consumption: that current consumption depends on expected lifetime income. The paper projects <b>future</b> <b>income</b> for a panel of households and finds that consumption {{is closely related to}} current income, but unrelated to predictable changes in <b>income.</b> However, <b>future</b> <b>income</b> uncertainty has an important effect: consumers facing greater income uncertainty consume less. The results are consistent with “buffer-stock ” models of consumption like those of Deaton [1991] or Carroll [1992 a,b] where precautionary motives greatly reduce the willingness of prudent consumers to consume out of uncertain <b>future</b> <b>income.</b> * This is a substantially revised version of my job market paper, which was entitled "Uncertain <b>Future</b> <b>Income...</b>|$|R

The first chapter deals with general characteristics of the <b>future</b> <b>income</b> tax. Why we should account it, which items cause it and what are the basic methods that exist. Another two chapters deal with particular national regulations with focus on the inception of the <b>future</b> <b>income</b> tax in specific cases of long-term assets acquisitions and its presentation in financial statements. The fourth chapter consists of illustrative example which presents the different presentation of the <b>future</b> <b>income</b> tax. It contains also an analysis of these differences...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{technique}} {{to assess the impact}} of changes in mortgage markets on households, exploiting an implication of the permanent income hypothesis: The higher a household's expected <b>future</b> <b>income,</b> the higher its desired consumption, ceteris paribus. With perfect credit markets, desired consumption matches actual consumption and current spending forecasts <b>future</b> <b>income.</b> Because credit market imperfections mute this effect, the extent to which house spending predicts <b>future</b> <b>income</b> measures the "imperfectness" of mortgage markets. Using micro-data, we find that since the early 1980 s, mortgage markets have become less imperfect in this sense, and securitization has played an important role.

40|$|This paper {{exploits}} yearly {{accounting data}} from 1977 to 1994 {{to test the}} relative signaling power of dividends and net stock repurchases. The specification controls for potential agency cost and asset dissipation effects. Specifically, we regress changes in <b>future</b> <b>income</b> before extraordinary items on changes in dividends, changes in net stock repurchases, {{and a host of}} control variables. We also split the sample at 1981 to measure the impact of changes in the relative taxation of distribution methods. For the full twenty-year sample, only dividend changes are correlated with changes in <b>future</b> <b>income.</b> Moreover, the dividend coefficient and the repurchases coefficient differ statistically different in every <b>future</b> <b>income</b> equation. Splitting the sample reveals that the pre- 1981 subsample drives the full-sample results. Put another way, the empirical link between changes in dividends and changes in <b>future</b> <b>income</b> vanishes just as a revision of the tax law reduced the tax disadvantage of dividend distributions. This evidence supports the notion that, at least for a period in time, firms deliberately exposed shareholders to punitive taxation to signal favorable prospects. Corporate governance...|$|R

First, we show that the marginal propensity to consume out of a tax cut, coupled with a <b>future</b> <b>income</b> tax increase, is positive under reasonable assumptions regarding preferences toward risk. Second, we document that the degree of income uncertainty facing the typical individual orfamily is large. Third, we show that, for plausible utility function parameters and distributions of <b>future</b> <b>income,</b> the MPC out of a tax cut is quantitatively large. Indeed, the MPC out of a tax cut, coupled with a <b>future</b> <b>income</b> tax increase, can be closer to the Keynesian value that ignores the future tax liabilities than to the Ricardian value that treats future taxes as if they were lump-sum. ...|$|R

We build a model of remittances and savings under income uncertainty and show that an immigrant will increase his remittances in response to a first-order risk decrease in <b>future</b> <b>income.</b> Using changes in the size and generosity of the welfare state as a measure of changes in <b>future</b> <b>income</b> risk, we empirically test the prediction of our model using panel data of bilateral remittances.

40|$|This paper {{establishes}} a stylized fact: in {{a cross-section of}} American consumers, consumption is an extremely poor predictor of <b>future</b> <b>income.</b> The PSID now contains {{the majority of the}} lifetime income stream for an early cross-section of consumers. Under the assumption that consumption {{is a function of the}} expected present value of income, I invert this function and compare the realized present value of income to consumption. Consumption proves to be a very poor predictor of <b>future</b> <b>income,</b> despite <b>future</b> <b>income</b> being predictable by past income. Under rational expectations, information known to the consumer should not enter the regression of present value on consumption. However, as an empirical matter lagged income is a better predictor than is consumption. This is true for both the present value of <b>future</b> <b>income</b> and for income at speci c future horizons. Indeed, the relation between consumption and income at increasingly longer horizons weakens quickly. One way to summarize results here is that if you want to forecast individual income and have to choose between consumption and a year-old income datum [...] . go with the latter. The conclusion is that consumers appear if " they are not forward-looking and that theories of consumption need to be consistent with this stylized fact. Available data being imperfect much of the paper is devoted to robustness tests, none of which change the basic conclusion...|$|R
