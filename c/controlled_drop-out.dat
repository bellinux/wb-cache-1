40|$|A {{total of}} 278 {{hypertensive}} patients in three clinics were randomly allocated {{to have their}} medical records held in a computer system (136) or on standard hospital notes (142). For the computer system the doctor completed a structured input form, and the information on symptoms, physical findings, and diagnoses was more complete than that in the standard notes. This resulted in certain symptoms and risk factors being recognised more often when the computer system was used. The hypertension clinics' routines were not disrupted {{by the introduction of}} a computer-held system, and follow-up consultation times were not affected by the type of records kept, although the first consultation took eight minutes longer when computer documents were completed. The patients remained in the trial for one year and clinical management was assessed from blood pressure <b>control,</b> <b>drop-out</b> rates, and the frequency of performing investigations. These estimates of management showed {{no significant difference between the}} two groups, but the attempt to tailor the computer system to help management made the system acceptable to the doctors using it. The computer system continues to be used and is providing data for research into hypertension...|$|R

40|$|Background. Response and {{remission}} {{defined by}} cut-off values {{on the last}} observed depression severity score are commonly used as outcome criteria in clinical trials, but ignore {{the time course of}} symptomatic change and may lead to inefficient analyses. We explore alternative categorization of outcome by naturally occurring trajectories of symptom change. Method. Growth mixture models were applied to repeated measurements of depression severity in 807 participants with major depression treated for 12 weeks with escitalopram or nortriptyline in the part-randomized Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression study. Latent trajectory classes were validated as outcomes in drug efficacy com-parison and pharmacogenetic analyses. Results. The final two-piece growth mixture model categorized participants into a majority (75 %) following a gradual improvement trajectory and the remainder following a trajectory with rapid initial improvement. The rapid improvement trajectory was over-represented among nortriptyline-treated participants and showed an antidepressant-specific pattern of pharmacogenetic associations. In contrast, conventional response and remission favoured escitalopram and produced chance results in pharmacogenetic analyses. <b>Controlling</b> for <b>drop-out</b> reduce...|$|R

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} the clinical efficacy and feasibility of an expiratory muscle training (EMT) device (Respilift) applied to patients recovering from recent open cardiothoracic surgery (CTS). Design. Prospective, double-blind, 14 -day randomised-controlled trial. Participants and Setting. A total of 60 inpatients recovering from recent CTS and early {{admitted to a}} pulmonary rehabilitation program. Interventions. Chest physiotherapy plus EMT with a resistive load of 30 [*]cm H 2 O for active group and chest physiotherapy plus EMT with a sham load for control group. Measures. Changes in maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) were considered as primary outcome, while maximal inspiratory pressures (MIP), dynamic and static lung volumes, oxygenation, perceived symptoms of dyspnoea, thoracic pain, and well being (evaluated by visual analogic scale—VAS) and general health status were considered secondary outcomes. Results. All outcomes recorded showed significant improvements in both groups; however, the change of MEP (+ 34. 2 [*]mmHg, and + 26. 1 %, for absolute and % of predicted, resp.) was significantly higher in active group. Also VAS dyspnoea improved faster and more significantly () at day 12, and 14 in active group when compared with <b>control.</b> The <b>drop-out</b> rate was 6 %, without differences between groups. Conclusions. In patients recovering from recent CTS, specific EMT by Respilift is feasible and effective. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01510275...|$|R

Conclusions Latent trajectory mixture models capture heterogeneity in the development of clinical response after the initiation of antidepressants and provide an outcome that is distinct from traditional endpoint measures. It differentiates between antidepressants with different modes of action and is robust against bias due to differential discontinuation. © Cambridge University Press 2009.

40|$|Research {{articles}} on the prognosis of stroke patients were analysed to identify studies that met sound methodological principles of prognostic research {{as well as to}} identify variables capable of predicting functional outcome (ADL) after stroke. Data sources comprised a computer-aided search of published prognostic studies and references to literature used in prognostic studies. Seventy-eight studies were tested for adherence to the following key methodological criteria: reliability and validity of measurement instruments used to assess dependent and independent variables; inclusion of an inception cohort; adequate and uniform end-point of observation; <b>control</b> for <b>drop-outs</b> during period of observation; statistical testing of presumed relationship between dependent and independent variables; sufficient sample size in relation to number of determinants; control for multicollinearity; specification of patient characteristics (i. e. age, type, recurrent stroke and localization of stroke); description of interfering treatment effects during the period of observation; and cross-validation of the prediction model in a second independent group of patients. Only three studies satisfied nine out of 11 criteria and ten studies eight criteria for the determination of valid prognostic research. The results of these studies indicate that the following variables are valid predictors for functional recovery after stroke: age; previous stroke; urinary continence; consciousness at onset; disorientation in time and place; severity of paralysis; sitting balance; admission ADL score; level of social support and metabolic rate of glucose outside the infarct area in hypertensive patients. This study supports the general opinion that not only are differences in objectives and heterogeneity in stroke patients responsible for the lack of accuracy in predicting functional outcome, but also the methodological flaws in published prognostic research...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To examine if a website-delivered {{physical}} activity intervention, that provides participants with computer-tailored feedback, can improve {{physical activity}} in the general population. Methods. Healthy adults (n = 434), recruited from parents and staff of 14 primary and secondary schools in Belgium {{in the spring of}} 2005, were allocated into one of two intervention groups (receiving intervention with or without repeated feedback) or a no-intervention control group. Physical activity-levels were self-reported at baseline and at 6 months (n = 285), using a computerized long version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire online. Repeated measures analysis of co-variances were used to examine differences between the three groups. Results. Intent-to-treat analysis showed significant time by group interaction effects in favor of both intervention groups compared with the control group. Significant increases were found for active transportation (+ 20, + 24, + 11 min/week respectively) and leisure-time physical activity (+ 26, + 19, - 4 min/week respectively); a significant decrease for minutes sitting on weekdays (- 22, - 34, + 4 min/day respectively). No {{significant differences were found between}} both intervention groups. Conclusion. A website-delivered intervention, including computer-tailoring, was able to increase physical activity when compared to a no-intervention <b>control</b> group. High <b>drop-out</b> rate and the low number of participants who received repeated feedback indicated that engagement and retention are important challenges in e-health studies.

40|$|For {{portable}} instrument, {{small size}} and light weight are essential. Regulated step-up charge pumps require fewer battery cells, need no inductors and thus help in reducing weight and size. Existing regulated charge pumps employ hysteresis control, PWM control or quasi-switch current <b>control.</b> A low <b>drop-out</b> regulator (LDR) is usually inserted to suppress large output ripple for noise-sensitive applications. This research presents a regulated charge pump with an integrated switching low drop-out regulator (SLDR). It {{consists of a}} dual-cell voltage doubler core with the output PMOS serving as pass transistor of the subsequent LDR. The LDR switches between the two cells and thus is called a switching LDR (SLDR). The control loop consists of a folded cascode operational amplifier for simple compensation and a high slew rate buffer in enhancing bandwidth for good line regulation. To further enhance the bandwidth, a new compensation technique, the dual-loop feedback (DLF), is developed, which reduces the compensation capacitors by hundred times compared to the conventional Miller compensation. The regulated charge pump with integrated SLDR is fabricated using a 0. 6 μ AMS CMOS process and occupies an area of 3 mm 2. The input voltage is 1. 8 V and the output voltage can be adjusted. The doubler SLDR with DLF has better performance and saves more area, and it combines the advantages of step-up converter and LDR...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the view of age-related prioritisation in health care among physicians and healthcare politicians and to compare their views regarding gender and age. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Swedish physicians (n= 390) and politicians (n= 310), mean age 52 years, answered an electronic questionnaire concerning age-related priority setting in healthcare. The questionnaire had fixed response alternatives with possibility of adding comments. FINDINGS: A majority of the participants thought that age should not influence prioritisation, although more physicians than politicians thought that younger patients should be prioritised. There were also significant differences concerning their views on lifestyle-related diseases and on who should make decisions concerning both vertical and horizontal prioritisation. The comments indicated that the politicians referred to ethical principles as a basis for their standpoints while the physicians often referred to the importance of biological rather than chronological age. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Web-based surveys as a method has its limitations as biased samples and biased returns could cause major problems, such as limited <b>control</b> over the <b>drop-outs.</b> The sample in this study was, however, judged to be representative. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The results indicate that supplementary guiding principles concerning prioritisation in healthcare are needed in order to facilitate decision-making concerning resource allocation on a local level. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper adds important knowledge about decision makers' views on age-related priorities in healthcare, thus contributing to scientific base for prioritisation in healthcare and the ongoing debate in society...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground: Since 2010, French {{secondary}} schools {{with a high}} proportion of students in academic difficulty benefit from a compensatory education policy called ‘Écoles Collèges et Lycées pour l'Ambition, l'Innovation et la Réussite’ (ÉCLAIR). These students tend to behave poorly and frequently disengage from learning tasks, and thus one of the greatest challenges for teachers is to keep them focused and active. The ‘academic learning time in physical education' is very low, about 14. 4 %. Purpose: This case study investigates the relations between the students' motor and social involvement and the class management strategies of four experienced physical education (PE) teachers in a difficult educational context. Participants and Setting: This case study focuses on four secondary school classes with the same characteristics: all are part of the ÉCLAIR program, are taught by experienced PE teacher, with hardly manageable underachieving students in drop-out situations (16 in total, between 12 and 16 years old), and offer four units of gymnastics (for a total of 26 lessons). The classes were organized as group activities, with instruction sheets, with an educational project based on the students' sense of autonomy and responsibility. Research Design: This research was conducted following a situated approach from the cognitive anthropology framework of ‘course of action'. Data collection: Extrinsic classroom data were collected by observing the students' and teacher's activities within the classroom and using audiovisual recordings. Intrinsic data were collected during self-confrontation interviews held after the lessons. Data Analysis: The data were processed in three stages: (a) the structure of students' and teachers' behaviors; (b) the dynamic of students' and teachers' experience, and (c) the classroom management strategies related to student misbehavior. Findings: The findings reveal that in spite of permanent classroom agitation, working involvement predominated with only short periods of student disengagement. Compromises organize the relation between students' involvement and teacher management strategies. There is a compromise between work and play time for the students – they mainly remained involved in their work, and were appropriately involved in their task both physically and socially. Then, there is a compromise of acceptance for the teachers, as they use specific management strategies based on <b>controlled</b> short <b>drop-outs</b> as a source of student involvement in work. Conclusions: These findings raise the question of how PE teachers working under the compensatory policy can best manage student misbehavior. The teacher's acceptance, compromises within the classroom, zone of acceptable responses, and articulation of instruction activity with misbehavior management, are as many factors improving teachers' professionalization...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the study: Investigation, whether water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) {{irradiation}} during moderate {{bicycle ergometer}} endurance exercise has effects especially on local fat reduction and on weight reduction beyond {{the effects of}} ergometer exercise alone. Methods: Randomised controlled study with 40 obese females (BMI 30 - 40 (median: 34. 5), body weight 76 - 125 (median: 94. 9) kg, age 20 - 40 (median: 35. 5) years, isocaloric nutrition), 20 in the wIRA group and 20 in the control group. In both groups each participant performed 3 times per week over 4 weeks for 45 minutes bicycle ergometer endurance exercise with a constant load according to a lactate level of 2 mmol/l (aerobic endurance load, as determined before the intervention period). In the wIRA group in addition {{large parts of the}} body (including waist, hip, and thighs) were irradiated during all ergometries of the intervention period with visible light and a predominant part of water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA), using the irradiation unit “Hydrosun® 6000 ” with 10 wIRA radiators (Hydrosun® Medizintechnik, Müllheim, Germany, radiator type 500, 4 mm water cuvette, yellow filter, water-filtered spectrum 500 - 1400 nm) around a speed independent bicycle ergometer. Main variable of interest: change of “the sum of circumferences of waist, hip, and both thighs of each patient” over the intervention period (4 weeks). Additional variables of interest: body weight, body mass index BMI, body fat percentage, fat mass, fat-free mass, water mass (analysis of body composition by tetrapolar bioimpedance analysis), assessment of an arteriosclerotic risk profile by blood investigation of variables of lipid metabolism (cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoproteins HDL, low density lipoproteins LDL, apolipoprotein A 1, apolipoprotein B), clinical chemistry (fasting glucose, alanin-aminotransferase ALT (= glutamyl pyruvic transaminase GPT), gamma-glutamyl-transferase GGT, creatinine, albumin), endocrinology (leptin, adiponectin (= adipo Q), homocysteine, insulin). All variables were at least measured before and after the intervention period. Ergometry (ECG, blood pressure behaviour, lactate curve with power at 2, 3 and 4 mmol/l) before the intervention period. In addition: nutrition training ahead of and during the intervention period with a nutrition protocol over one week for assessment of the daily energy intake; calculation of basic metabolic rate and total energy requirement. Assessment of undesired effects. Only methods of non-parametric statistics were used, both descriptive (median, percentiles of 25 and 75 (= interquartile range), minimum, maximum) and confirmatory (two-sided Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples for the only one main variable of interest). Total error probability:. 05 (5 %). An intention to treat analysis ITT with last observed carry forward method was used preferably (presented results) and in addition an on treatment analysis OT. Only 2 (treatment group) and 4 (<b>control</b> group) <b>drop-outs</b> occurred (mostly due to lack of time). Results: The “sum of circumferences of waist, hip, and both thighs of each patient” decreased during the 4 weeks significantly more (p<. 001) in the wIRA group than in the control group: medians and interquartile ranges: - 8. 0 cm (- 10. 5 cm/- 4. 1 cm) vs. - 1. 8 cm (- 4. 4 cm/ 0. 0 cm). As well “body weight of each patient” decreased during the 4 weeks markedly more in the wIRA group than in the control group: medians and interquartile ranges: - 1. 9 kg (- 4. 0 kg/ 0. 0 kg) vs. 0. 0 kg (- 1. 5 kg/+ 0. 4 kg); median of body weight changed from 99. 3 kg to 95. 6 kg (wIRA) vs. 89. 9 kg to 89. 6 kg (control). A similar effect showed the body mass index BMI. Blood variables of interest remained unchanged or showed some slight improvements during the treatment period, concerning most variables with no obvious differences between the two groups; insulin showed a slight trend to decrease in the wIRA group and to increase in the control group. Undesired effects of the treatment were not seen. Discussion: The results of the study suggest, that wIRA – during moderate bicycle ergometer endurance exercise as lipolytic stimulus – increases local lipolysis with a local fat reduction (thighs) in the otherwise bradytrophic fatty tissue. The presumably underlying mechanisms of wIRA have already been proven: wIRA acts both by thermal effects and by non-thermal effects. Thermal effects of wIRA are the generation of a therapeutic field of warmth with the increase of tissue temperature, tissue oxygen partial pressure, and tissue blood flow, and by this regional metabolism. As fatty tissue normally has a slow metabolism (bradytrophic and hypothermic tissue) with a low rate of lipolysis, wIRA can increase lipolysis in fatty tissue and the mobilized fats are burned in musculature during the ergometer exercise. Conclusion: The results of the study indicate, that wIRA irradiation during moderate ergometer endurance exercise can be used – in combination with an appropriate nutrition – to improve body composition, especially local fat distribution, and the reduction of fat and body weight in obese persons...|$|R
