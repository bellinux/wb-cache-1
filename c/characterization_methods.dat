40|$|Ultra-precision {{freeform}} {{surfaces are}} complex surfaces that possess non-rotational symmetry and {{are widely used}} in advanced optics applications. However, {{there is a lack}} of a surface <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> that measures the form accuracy of the ultra-precision freeform surfaces with micrometre to sub-micrometre form accuracy. Due to the high precision requirement of the ultra-precision freeform surfaces, this inevitably involves the outliers in the measured data that would significantly affect the accuracy and the performance of the form <b>characterization</b> <b>method.</b> Although some research work has been found in the development of the form <b>characterization</b> <b>method,</b> most workers have not considered the influence of outliers. It is vital to incorporate robust estimation in the surface <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> for catering for the influence of outliers. In this paper, a robust form <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> (RFCM) is presented to characterize the form accuracy of the ultra-precision freeform surfaces. A series of computer simulation and experimental analyses were undertaken to verify the RFCM. The theoretical results agree well with the simulation and experimental results.

40|$|International audiencePower {{consumption}} {{is one of}} the major issues in System-on-Chip (SoC) design with advanced semiconductor technologies for low power applications such as mobile phones. Recently, banking several 1 -bit flip-flops has been proposed as a solution to reduce the power consumption in clock networks. For this purpose, to build an accurate power model for multi-bit flip-flop banks is required. However, it is an excessively timeconsuming and sophisticated work due to a high number of pins. Therefore, we first propose a simplified power <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> to reduce <b>characterization</b> time. Then an efficient power modeling is introduced to create an accurate state-dependent power model for multi-bit flip-flop banks. Experimental results show that the proposed <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> allows to linearly increase CPU time with 1. 3 X per bit comparing with exponentially increasing CPU time by the traditional <b>characterization</b> <b>method.</b> In addition, the proposed power modeling provides an average error of 6 % compared to SPICE simulation results...|$|R

For sampled-time systems, this allows knowing the state of the net charge at each sampling time without distorting the measurement.

The goodness of the proposed approach is obtained by matching the experimentally obtained closed loop response with the one predicted using the proposed <b>characterization</b> <b>method.</b> The <b>characterization</b> <b>method</b> also provides a criterion to avoid nonlinear effects, such as fractal-like behaviour, in charge control.

50|$|Surface {{passivation}} {{techniques can}} greatly increase the corrosion resistance of nitinol. In order for nitinol {{to have the}} desired superelastic and shape memory properties, heat treatment is required.

This increase in nickel has been attributed to the diffusion of nickel out of the bulk material and into the surface layer during elevated temperature treatments.

50|$|Molar mass {{determination}} of copolymers {{is a much}} more complicated procedure. The complications arise from the effect of solvent on the homopolymers and how this can affect the copolymer morphology. Analysis of copolymers typically requires multiple <b>characterization</b> <b>methods.</b> For instance, copolymers with short chain branching such as linear low-density polyethylene (a copolymer of ethylene and a higher alkene such as hexene or octene) require the use of Analytical Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation (ATREF) techniques. These techniques can reveal how the short chain branches are distributed over the various molecular weights. A more efficient analysis of copolymer molecular mass and composition is possible using GPC combined with a triple-detection system comprising multi-angle light scattering, UV absorption and differential refractometry, if the copolymer is composed of two base polymers that provide different responses to UV and/or refractive index.|$|E
