50|$|Monastic {{tradition}} ascribes {{the gospel}} books to Saint Abba Garima, {{said to have}} arrived in Ethiopia in 494. Abba Garima {{is one of the}} Nine Saints traditionally thought to have come from Syria, and to have evangelized the rural populations of the ancient Ethiopian kingdom of Axum in the sixth century; and the monks regard the Gospels less as significant antiquities than as sacred relics of Abba Garima. According to tradition, Abba Garima wrote and illustrated the complete Gospels in a single day; God stopped the sun from setting until the Saint completed his work. Definitive radiocarbon tests have indeed supported the dating Abba Garima 2, the earlier of the two books, to the sixth century, but otherwise recent research tends to <b>contra-indicate</b> many aspects of the traditional account; proposing instead that the text-base for the Garima gospels is Greek not Syriac, that the iconography and palaeography looks to Egyptian not Syrian sources, and that the gospel translation witnessed in the Garima gospels had been completed over a century before the traditional dates for the Nine Saints. Furthermore, the supposed Syrian origin of the Nine Saints is no longer maintained in most recent scholarship.|$|E
40|$|Systemic {{side-effects}} during irrigation of {{body cavities}} with the antiseptic noxythiolin (Noxyflex) have not previously been reported. In two patients undergoing intrapleural lavage with 1 % noxythiolin, anorexia and nausea {{with or without}} vomiting were observed which suggested systemic absorption. This was confirmed by chemical assays of serum from these patients. The process of absorption was studied in rabbits by injection of noxythiolin into the pleural or peritoneal cavity. Serum levels reached a peak at one to two hours indicating rapid entry into the bloodstream, declined slowly over seven hours, and reached zero before 24 hours. Although side-effects resulted from systemic absorption of noxythiolin during irrigation of the pleural cavity, they were mild and did not <b>contra-indicate</b> the use of noxythiolin as an irrigant.

40|$|Aim: The aim was {{to study}} prescription-drug use in {{pregnant}} women {{in the department of}} the Aube. Method: We used the data-base of the general scheme of French health insurance (régime général de l’assurance maladie) in order to obtain all reimbursed drug prescriptions for March 2000. Results: The incidence of prescription-drug use in this cohort of women was 81. 78 per 100 persons month. Among the 1, 313 pregnant women who were reimbursed for at least one medication, 1. 7 % took a prescription drug which was absolutely <b>contra-indicated</b> during pregnancy and 3. 9 % received one which was relatively <b>contra-indicated</b> during pregnancy.

40|$|Abstract Invasive {{cervical}} resorption is {{a condition}} that affects the root surface area below the epithelial attachment. Multiple treatment modalities are advocated, involving exposure of the invasive defect, removal of the granulation tissue and sealing with various restorative materials. This report demonstrates conservative treatment of a patient presenting with peri-apical periodontitis in upper right central and lateral incisors, along with Class II invasive resorption defect cervically on the mesial aspect of the central incisor, {{as a result of}} trauma. As the patient was not willing for any surgical intervention, only ortho-grade root canal treatment was carried out in both teeth, with Calcium hydroxide as intra-canal medicament. At three year follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic demonstrating radiographic evidence of infilling of defect with bone-like tissue. Within the limitations of this report, it was seen that this conservative method for halting the progression of invasive cervical resorption could be under taken in patients who are un-willing for surgical intervention or in whom surgery is <b>contra-indicate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Workers’ {{compensation}} and disability {{management in the}} hazardous occupations of mining and construction are ongoing concerns for employers, employees, insurers and Governments. Rising insurance costs, options of self insurance models, highly competitive tendering, legislative rigidities, and escalating costs of compensation, have contributed to industry practices for injured workers that are driven by cost containment strategies rather than benchmarked disability management processes. In this article a critical review of legislation, industry practices, and published reports is undertaken {{with a view to}} outlining the adequacy of current and planned services and practices {{to meet the needs of}} injured workers in both sectors.

40|$|Twenty-five {{patients}} with overt clinical and biochemical findings of {{porphyria cutanea tarda}} {{took part in a}} study comparing intensive phlebotomy with slow subcutaneous desferrioxamine treatment. Fifteen male patients (Group A) had intensive venesection therapy. Ten patients (Group B) with associated diseases (minor thalassemia, cardiovascular impairment, pulmonary tuberculosis or severe liver cirrhosis) received 1. 5 g of desferrioxamine by slow subcutaneous infusion using an automatic syringe pump 5 days a week. No patient complained of appreciable side effects. Serum iron, ferritin and uroporphyrins were normalized in all subjects by the end of treatment. The mean time necessary for complete recovery was 13. 8 months (range 9 - 19) and 11. 2 months (range 6 - 14) in Groups A and B, respectively.

40|$|While {{ischaemic stroke}} remains a {{leading cause of}} death and disability, there have been recent advancements in {{treatment}} modalities including thrombolysis and decompressive hemicraniectomy. A retrospective review of patients treated in our NHS teaching hospital, in Plymouth (UK), over a 2 year period identified 17 thrombolysed patients, of whom two had undergone subsequent decompressive hemicraniectomy. These were non-dominant hemisphere strokes in young patients, aged 51 and 57. Initial NIHSS scores were 16 and 17, and they received thrombolysis at 2 [*]hrs 42 [*]min and 5 [*]hrs 10 [*]min post onset of symptoms respectively. CT imaging demonstrated cerebral swelling with significant midline shift in both cases, and decompressive hemicraniectomy was undertaken at 29 [*]hrs 8 [*]min and 27 [*]hrs 30 [*]min post-thrombolysis.

Next, the author develops a calibration methodology for the ARID based on visual and acoustic sensing. A sensor platform, {{consisting of a}} camera and four sonars attached to the ARID end frame, performs calibration measurements. A calibration measurement consists of processing one visual frame of an accurately placed calibration image and recording four acoustic range measurements. A minimum of two measurement protocols determine the kinematics calibration-model of the ARID for a particular region: assuming the joint displacements are accurately measured, the calibration surface is planar, and the kinematic parameters do not vary rapidly in the region.

40|$|Background Among the {{modalities}} for lung imaging, proton {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) has been the latest to be introduced into clinical practice. Its value to replace X-ray and computed tomography (CT) when radiation exposure or iodinated contrast material is contra-indicated is well acknowledged: i. e. for paediatric patients and pregnant women or for scientific use. One {{of the reasons why}} MRI of the lung is still rarely used, except in a few centres, is the lack of consistent protocols customised to clinical needs. Methods This article makes non-vendor-specific protocol suggestions for general use with state-of-the-art MRI scanners, based on the available literature and a consensus discussion within a panel of experts experienced in lung MRI. Results Various sequences have been successfully tested within scientific or clinical environments. MRI of the lung with appropriate combinations of these sequences comprises morphological and functional imaging aspects in a single examination. It serves in difficult clinical problems encountered in daily routine, such as assessment of the mediastinum and chest wall, and even might challenge molecular imaging techniques in the near future. Conclusion This article helps new users to implement appropriate protocols on their own MRI platforms. Main Messages • MRI of the lung can be readily performed on state-of-the-art 1. 5 -T MRI scanners. • Protocol suggestions based on the available literature facilitate its use for routine • MRI offers solutions for complicated thoracic masses with atelectasis and chest wall invasion. • MRI is an option for paediatrics and science when CT is <b>contra-indicate...</b>|$|E

40|$|Four {{patients}} {{suffering for}} severe drug-resistant epilepsy from bihemispheric cortical dysplasias underwent anterior callosotomy. One {{of these patients}} also presented mental retardation of mild degree associated with the epileptic syndrome. There were no operative complications in this series. Clinical signs of interhemispheric disconnection were not detectable postoperatively. Twenty-eight to 53 months after surgery, the generalized seizures were completely suppressed in 2 cases, and were reduced by 89 - 97 % in frequency in the other 2 cases. Partial seizures were less affected by callosotomy being reduced by 14 - 87 %. In an additional fifth case of intractable epilepsy from bihemispheric cortical dysplasias with associated severe mental retardation operated upon elsewhere for callosotomy and followed at our institution, the outcome for seizures was completely unsatisfactory. Neurophysiological studies revealed that the interhemispheric transfer (IHT) of visuo-motor responses was functionally impaired after callosotomy only in one patient who harboured bilateral cortical dysplasias in the occipital lobes. This malformation might affect the pattern of axonal projection to the posterior portion of the corpus callosum which is considered of crucial importance for the integration of crossed visuo-motor responses. From this paper the following conclusions can be drawn: a) epileptic patients with severe drug-resistant epilepsy due to bihemispheric cortical dysplasias are good candidates for callosotomy, b) one-stage extensive anterior callosotomy sparing the splenium is the procedure of choice, c) associated severe mental retardation seems to <b>contra-indicate</b> callosotomy, d) the neurophysiological study of the IHT can yield information on the functional status of the corpus callosum...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess variations in the occurrence of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) and the risk of developing pain and function impairment of the temporomandibular complex in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients treated with either an oral appliance (mandibular advancement device) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in a 2 -year follow-up study. In addition, we assessed the relationship between the mean mandibular protrusion and the frequency of wearing the appliance during follow-up with the occurrence of pain and function impairment of the temporomandibular complex. Fifty-one patients were randomized to oral appliance therapy and 52 patients to CPAP therapy. TMDs (diagnosed according to the Axis I Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD), pain intensity and disability and mandibular function impairment were recorded at baseline, after 2 months, 1 year and 2 years of therapy. Only in the initial period of treatment the occurrence of pain-related TMDs was considerably higher (24 %) in the oral appliance group compared to CPAP (6 %). Oral appliance therapy furthermore resulted in more temporomandibular pain compared to CPAP (odds ratio 2. 33, 95 % confidence interval (1. 22 - 4. 43)). However, there were no limitations in mandibular function in both groups during the (entire) follow-up period. Although generally not serious and of transient nature, oral appliance therapy results in more pain-related TMDs in the initial period of use compared with CPAP therapy. Oral appliance therapy is associated with increased pain in the temporomandibular complex in the initial period of use. Because of the transient nature, this pain is not a reason to <b>contra-indicate</b> an oral appliance in OSAS patients. Moreover, TMDs and the risk of developing pain and function impairment of the temporomandibular complex appear limited with long-term oral appliance use...|$|E

40|$|Students with {{classroom}} behavioral problems forfeit valuable academic engagement time and {{are at risk}} for academic failure. As a school-based behavioral intervention, the school-home note (SHN) has been used to decrease problem behaviors such as classroom disruptions, physical and verbal aggression, social, and academic problems. Because little research has been done to explore actual usage by teachers, {{the purpose of this study}} was to compare the actual practice of SHNs to the research literature. In this qualitative study, teachers were interviewed and transcripts were analyzed using the comparative case study method. Findings of the study fell into three broad categories: confirmation of the research literature, expanded SHN usage, and the teachers 2 ̆ 7 perception of the impact of parental support on SHN success. First, SHN practice as well as the actual SHNs replicated findings in the research literature. Teachers found the SHN to be an acceptable tool for communication to parents as well as a tool for behavioral intervention, and they voluntarily implemented the SHN without formal training. In addition many teachers designed their own SHNs to address the needs of the students. Second, the SHNs 2 ̆ 7 usage was expanded to address a greater variety of problem behaviors, to communicate progress of regular education students as well as special education students and to communicate progress of entire classes of students from the beginning of the school year regardless of academic level or social or behavioral problems of the students. Finally, because of the SHNs 2 ̆ 7 communicative nature, it engaged parents in the educational process, which helped to develop and solidify parental support that the teachers believed was essential for SHN success. Potential implications for practice include: consideration of situations and parental variables that <b>contra-indicate</b> the use of SHNs, the importance of clear classroom expectations, and the possible future use of whole class SHNs as a whole class intervention to shape the behavior of all students including students with special needs. ...|$|E
40|$|Standard {{therapy for}} {{patients}} with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia {{involves the use of}} DNA damaging drugs. If the cellular DNA damage response has been compromised then these standard therapies will be ineffective at inducing apoptosis. Central to this response is the protein, p 53. Loss of the chromosome containing the gene TP 53, which encodes the protein p 53 and/or mutation of the gene, occurs in approximately 5 - 10 % of newly diagnosed CLL patients. This rises to over 30 % in patients who relapse after therapy. In addition another important protein within the DNA damage response, the protein-kinase ATM, may be deleted and/or mutated in a further 20 - 30 % of CLL cases. Loss of the chromosomal loci containing either TP 53 or ATM has been shown to predict a poor response to treatment and shorter overall survival. It is now known that detecting loss alone is insufficient as miss-sense or non-sense mutation of these genes alone can lead to an equally poor outcome. Screening these genes for mutations is not carried out routinely and can be technically challenging. In addition to this it is not fully understood to what degree other genes may be involved in dysfunction of the DNA damage response. Functional assays provide an alternative method for testing the integrity of the p 53 -dependant DNA damage response without needing to focus upon specific genomic abnormalities. A flow-cytometry based assay, utilising etoposide/nutlin 3 a and developed in our laboratory, has already been shown to detect and discriminate between p 53 and ATM abnormalities in a small series of patients. This project aims to assess the clinical value of the etoposide/nutlin 3 a functional assay for detecting abnormalities of the p 53 - dependant DNA damage response which would <b>contra-indicate</b> treatment with DNA damaging drugs in samples referred from around the UK. A total of 472 samples from participating centres around the UK have been tested using the functional assay and also assessed for deletion of ATM and p 53. The assay is largely unaffected by transport of whole blood samples across the UK if transit time is no greater than 48 hours and the sample is not stored above room temperature. Dysfunctional assay results have been shown to have a highly significant association with deletion of the genes for p 53 and ATM. The use of nutlin 3 a has been shown to discriminate between dysfunctional cases with deletion of ATM or loss/mutation of p 53. The assay has been shown to detect patients with mutation of the p 53 gene who do not have concurrent deletion of the second allele. A novel dysfunctional response pattern involving p 21 expression has been shown to associate with abnormalities of p 53 rather than single nucleotide polymorphisms. The results also show that deletion of p 53 and particularly ATM does not per se lead to a dysfunctional response as currently detected by the assay. This suggests that other mechanisms or genes are involved in resistance to DNA damage induced apoptosis...|$|E
