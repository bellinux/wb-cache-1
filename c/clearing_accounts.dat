2500|$|In October 1940, Germany and the Soviet Union {{negotiated}} {{about the}} Volksdeutsche in Soviet-occupied territories and their property. Instead of permitting full indemnification, the Soviets put {{restrictions on the}} wealth that the Volksdeutsche could take with them and limited the totals that the Soviets would apply to the Reich's <b>clearing</b> <b>accounts.</b> [...] The parties discussed total compensation of between 200 million and 350 million Reichsmarks for the Volksdeutsche, while the Soviets requested 50 million Reichsmarks for their property claims in German-occupied territories. The two nations reached general agreement on German shipments of 10.5-cm flak cannons, gold, machinery and other items.|$|E
2500|$|Negotiations {{began in}} Moscow on October 30. German {{military}} economic negotiators {{had hoped for}} success in the negotiations, in part, because they felt this would strengthen their arguments against Hitler's then increasingly anti-Soviet policy. The parties came closer to agreements on German 38-cm turrets, but the Soviets continued to resist demands for a full reimbursement of Volksdeutsche property. Instead of permitting full indemnification, the Soviets put restrictions on the wealth that the Volksdeutsche could take with them and limited the totals that the Soviets would apply to the Reich's <b>clearing</b> <b>accounts.</b> [...] In November, negotiations proceeded well for Germany on potential modifications for year two of the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement, with the Soviets first increasing their grain offer from 1.2 million tons to 1.5 million, and then up to Germany's demand for 2.5 million tons. [...] Negotiations regarding the [...] "Lithuanian Strip" [...] required Hitler's direct intervention, so negotiations were briefly suspended on November 29 awaiting his actions.|$|E

50|$|Clearing {{trade was}} at its busiest up to the 1970s, but began to lose its {{momentum}} in the 1980s. In the last of its years, the Soviet Union's debt began accumulating on an alarming rate into <b>clearing</b> <b>accounts.</b> As a result, the Soviet Union started to pay the deficits with oil, a good with little value added and easily exchangeable to hard currency, which militated against the principle of bilateral trade. With {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, this form of trade has mostly disappeared. Bilateral trade is a manifestation of bilateralism; in contrast, multilateralism and in particular multilateral trade agreements became more important.|$|E

Former COA chairperson Guillermo Carague disapproved Mendoza to go to New York to investigate on the matter. Two more accounts by the military, one each at General Santos and Iloilo City, which were used as <b>clearing</b> <b>accounts</b> for the UN funds, were discovered by Mendoza. Mendoza testified that Carague's orders on not to pursue the cases disheartened her; Carague, Mendoza said, was given by orders from the executive department, probably from the Executive Secretary.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1942 the government introduced compulsory work service for all citizens between the age of 18 and 25. Up to that time around 7,55 billion Yugoslav dinars were replaced by the NDH kuna at an exchange rate of 1 dinar for 1 kuna. The government kept printing money and its amount in circulation was rapidly increasing, resulting in high inflation rates. By the end of 1943 there were 43,6 billion kunas in circulation and in August 1944 76,8 billion. Constant money printing {{was a way of}} financing huge government spending, that could not be covered by increased taxation and long-term borrowing. The NDH inherited 42% or 32,5 million reichsmarks of the total debt Yugoslavia owed to Germany. According to official data, the total debt of NDH on <b>clearing</b> <b>accounts</b> at the end of 1944 amounted to 969,8 million kunas.|$|E

5000|$|These {{features}} were {{rooted in the}} planned character of the members' economies and their systems of administered prices. Currency inconvertibility in turn dictated bilateral balancing of accounts, which {{has been one of}} the basic objectives of intergovernmental trade agreements among members. An earlier system of bilateral <b>clearing</b> <b>accounts</b> was replaced on January 1, 1964, by accounts with the International Bank for Economic Cooperation, using the transferable ruble as the unit of account. Although the bank provided a centralized mechanism of trade accounting and swing credits to cover temporary imbalances, it could not establish a system of multilateral clearing because of the centrally planned nature of the members' economies and the inconvertibility of their currencies. In 1987, the transferable ruble remained an artificial currency functioning as an accounting unit and was not a common instrument for multilateral settlement. For this reason, this currency continued to be termed [...] "transferable" [...] and not [...] "convertible." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{initial margin}} {{requirement}} {{is the amount}} of collateral required to open a position. Thereafter, the collateral required until the position is closed is the maintenance requirement. The maintenance requirement is the minimum amount of collateral required to keep the position open and is generally lower than the initial requirement. This allows the price to move against the margin without forcing a margin call immediately after the initial transaction. When the total value of collateral after haircuts dips below the maintenance margin requirement, the position holder must pledge additional collateral to bring their total balance after haircuts back up to or above the initial margin requirement. On instruments determined to be especially risky, however, the regulators, the exchange, or the broker may set the maintenance requirement higher than normal or equal to the initial requirement to reduce their exposure to the risk accepted by the trader. For speculative futures and derivatives <b>clearing</b> <b>accounts,</b> futures commission merchants may charge a premium or margin multiplier to exchange requirements. This is typically an additional 10%-25%.|$|E

[...] BDO Unibank. failed to disclose the extent of its exposure to Lehman paper, stating [...] "only that its balance sheet should be adequately covered from potential losses arising from its Lehman exposure due to MAIC insurance reimbursement. The provisions will come from reallocation of excess reserves and from additional provisions in the current period." [...] BDO Unibank., capitalised at ₱89.8 billion, closed 15.4% down to ₱33. [...] BDO Unibank. said, however, on September 19 [...] "it had a total exposure of $ 134 million to bankrupt U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers: This represents the face value of securities held in MAIC trust accounts by the bank. Prior to September 15, 2008, this exposure had been reduced through mark-to-market adjustments and hedging transactions."

40|$|From page 298 [...] 'Here, I {{consider}} {{two possible}} grounds for such concern. I first consider {{the consequences of}} increased information {{on the part of}} market participants about monetary policy actions and decisions. According to the view that the effectiveness of monetary policy is enhanced by, or even entirely dependent upon, the ability of central banks to surprise the markets, there might be reason to fear that monetary policy will be less effective in the information economy. I then consider the consequences of financial innovations tending to reduce private-sector demand for the monetary base. These include the development of techniques that allow financial institutions to more efficiently manage their customers’ balances in accounts subject to reserve requirements and their own balances in <b>clearing</b> <b>accounts</b> at the central bank, so that a given volume of payments in the economy can be executed with a smaller quantity of central-bank balances. And somewhat more speculatively, some argue that “electronic money” of various sorts may soon provide alternative means of payment that can substitute for those currently supplied by central banks. It may be feared that such developments can soon eliminate what small leverage central banks currently have over the private economy, so that again monetary policy will become ineffective. ...|$|E
