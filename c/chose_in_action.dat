5000|$|A <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> {{sometimes}} called a chose in suspense, in its more limited meaning, denotes {{the right to}} enforce payment of a debt by legal proceedings, obtain money by way of damages for contract, or receive recompense for a wrong. Less accurately, money that could be recovered is frequently called a <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> as is also sometimes the document that represents a title to a <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> such as a bond or a policy of insuranceâ€”though strictly {{it is only the}} right to recover the money. Choses in action were, before the Judicature Acts, either legal or equitable. Where the chose could be recovered only by an action at law, as a debt (whether arising from contract or tort), it was termed a legal chose in action; where the chose was recoverable only by a suit in equity, as a legacy or money held upon a trust, it was termed an equitable <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action.</b> Before the Judicature Acts, a legal <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action</b> was not assignable, i.e., the assignee could not sue at law in his own name. To this rule there were two exceptions: ...|$|E
5000|$|Intangible {{personal}} property or [...] "intangibles" [...] refers to {{personal property}} that cannot actually be moved, touched or felt, but instead represents {{something of value}} such as negotiable instruments, securities, service (economics), and intangible assets including <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action</b> is {{essentially}} a right to sue. It is an intangible personal property right recognized and protected by the law, that has no existence apart from the recognition given by the law, and that confers no present possession of a tangible object. Another term is a thing in action.|$|E

5000|$|After 10cc {{split in}} 1983, Graham Gouldman persuaded Gold {{to visit him}} {{at his home in}} Mottram St Andrew, England, to write and spend some time together. He ended up staying for seven months. During this period they wrote enough songs for an album. They <b>chose</b> World <b>in</b> <b>Action</b> as the band name and {{released}} a single [...] "Don't Break My Heart". Soon afterwards, they changed the name to Common Knowledge. A second single [...] "Victoria" [...] was released, but both singles failed to get any attention and the album was shelved.|$|R
50|$|In {{artificial}} intelligence, Thompson sampling, {{named after}} William R. Thompson, is a heuristic for choosing actions {{that addresses the}} exploration-exploitation dilemma in the multi-armed bandit problem. It consists <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> the <b>action</b> that maximizes the expected reward {{with respect to a}} randomly drawn belief.|$|R
50|$|The {{consequence}} was that, {{with these}} and certain statutory exceptions (e.g., actions on policies of insurance), an action on an assigned <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action</b> {{must have been}} brought at law {{in the name of}} the assignor, though the sum recovered belonged in equity to the assignee. All choses in action being in equity assignable, except those altogether incapable of being assigned, in equity the assignee might have sued in his own name, making the assignor a party as co-plaintiff or as defendant. The Judicature Acts made the distinction between legal and equitable choses in action of no importance. The Judicature Act of 1873, s. 25 (6), enacted that the legal right to a debt or other legal <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action</b> could be passed by absolute assignment in writing under the hand of the assignor. This was later updated by the Law of Property Act 1925 s136.|$|E

They can sell it, assign it, exchange it, release it, mortgage it, and do most other things that they could do with a <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
50|$|A stock {{certificate}} represents a legal proprietary {{interest in the}} common stock (in {{the sense of the}} general fund) or assets of the issuer corporation. The certificate evidences a <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action</b> against the issuer to collect dividends and usually to influence the issuer through voting pursuant to the issuer's charter and bylaws, which are often implied or incorporated by reference as terms {{on the face of the}} certificate.|$|E
50|$|A zero-intelligence trader (ZI) is {{a simple}} {{algorithmic}} trader in a market based on the dumb agent theory who proposes to purchase (bid) or to sell (ask) randomly, subject only to minimal constraints. Constraints might be resource or bankruptcy constraints imposed externally {{by the rules of}} the market. Ownership of sufficient resources to buy the items the trader bids for, or ownership of resources the trader offers for sale are examples of such market-imposed constraints. Alternatively, the constraints may be internal to the trader. Not bidding more than the value of the resource to the trader, and not asking less than the cost of the resource to the trader are examples of such internal constraints. Under either interpretation, ZI traders use minimal intelligence <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> their <b>actions</b> <b>in</b> markets.|$|R

5000|$|Chose (pronounced: , French for [...] "thing") is a {{term used}} in common law {{tradition}} in different senses. A chose local is a thing annexed to a place, such as a mill.

50|$|The {{case was}} {{heard by the}} Liverpool Stipendiary Magistrate, and it was argued by the {{prosecution}} that the information itself was property capable of being stolen because it had attached to it a proprietary right of confidence, and once this was breached, the information itself had been stolen.

5000|$|The offence {{of obtaining}} a money {{transfer}} by deception, contrary to section 15A of the Theft Act 1968, was specifically enacted {{to remove the}} problem caused by R v Preddy and Slade, R v Dhillon. This case held that there no section 15 offence was committed when the defendant caused transfers between the victim's and his own bank account by deception. This arises because of the legal relationship between a bank and its customer. The account is a <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> i.e. a debt owed by the bank to the customer or vice versa. Thus, when the [...] "transfer" [...] took place, one debt owed by the bank to its client was reduced, and a second debt in the same amount was created, Thus, nothing formerly belonging to the victim was obtained by the defendant.|$|E
5000|$|He {{held that}} the effect of the word [...] "avoided" [...] in section 64 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882 was that, subject to the {{qualifications}} therein, a cheque or banker's draft which had been materially altered by the fraud of a third party was no longer a cheque or draft representing a <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action</b> but a worthless piece of paper, and no action for damages in conversion for its face value could therefore be brought by a party, such as the claimants, who, but for the material alteration, would have had contractual rights based upon it. Moreover, in the first action, by presenting the materially altered and therefore invalid cheque under normal banking arrangements, the collecting bank was not asserting its validity and accordingly the consequence of invalidity could not be avoided by alleging an estoppel.|$|E

40|$|When {{a mobile}} robot {{does not have}} perfect {{knowledge}} of its position, conventional controllers can experience failures such as collisions because {{the uncertainty of the}} position is not considered <b>in</b> <b>choosing</b> control <b>actions.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we show how global planning and local feedback control can be combined to generate control laws in the space of distributions over position, that is, in information space. We give a novel algorithm for computing ldquoinformation-constrainedrdquo linear quadratic Gaussian (icLQG) policies for controlling a robot with imperfect state information. The icLQG algorithm uses the belief roadmap algorithm to efficiently search for a trajectory that approximates the globally-optimal motion plan in information space, and then iteratively computes a feedback control law to locally optimize the global approximation. The icLQG algorithm is not only robust to imperfect state information but also scalable to high-dimensional systems and environments. In addition, icLQG is capable of answering multiple queries efficiently. We demonstrate performance results for controlling a vehicle on the plane and a helicopter in three dimensions.

5000|$|Chose in {{possession}} {{is opposed to}} <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> and denotes not only the right to enjoy or possess a thing, but also the actual or constructive enjoyment of it. The possession may be absolute or qualified. It is absolute when the person is fully and completely the proprietor or owner of the thing; it is qualified when he [...] "has not an exclusive right, or not a permanent right, but a right that may sometimes subsist {{and at other times}} not subsist", {{as in the case of}} animals ferae naturae ("of a feral nature", or wild). A chose {{in possession}} is freely transferable by delivery. Previous to the Married Women's Property Act of 1882, a wife's choses in possession became vested in her husband immediately upon her marriage, while her choses in action did not belong to her husband until he had converted them to possession. However, this difference is now practically obsolete.|$|E
50|$|In {{some legal}} systems, {{perfection}} {{of a security}} interest requires notice {{to be given to}} a relevant third party. This most commonly arises in relation to security over a debt or other <b>chose</b> <b>in</b> <b>action,</b> notice being required to be given to the party owing the debt or holding the fund. Under English law, an often cited example is the well-known rule in Dearle v Hall. Under the rule if A is owed money by X, and then A grants an equitable charge over that debt to B, and then grants a second equitable charge over the same debt to C, then the ability to enforce the charge by either B or C against the money in X's hands is dependent upon the giving of notice to X. The controversy in the rule relates {{to the fact that it}} is also a rule of priority, meaning that (if their rights are otherwise equal) the first one to give notice to X has the prior claim, irrespective of the order in which the equitable charges were granted.|$|E
