5000|$|Chains, {{which are}} {{attached}} {{from the top}} of the cranes to the <b>corner</b> <b>castings</b> at the base of the container(s) during lifting operations. There is a special linking device that when placed between two 20 ft containers allows the user to lock two 20 ft (2 TEUs) containers together allowing the sidelifter to lift them as if they were a 40 ft container.|$|E
50|$|Each hull has two pylons (the forward {{ones are}} vented {{to allow the}} {{pressure}} inside the hull to equalise) and the frame fits onto these pylons. The frame consists of four aluminium alloy beams which slot into four aluminium alloy <b>corner</b> <b>castings</b> and are secured with rivets. The trampoline slots along {{the inside of the}} beams and is tensioned by rope or shock cord. Racers commonly epoxy the beams into the castings to boost rigidity because the flexing of the boat as it rides over waves saps power. Equally, the joints may be packed with aluminium sheet cut from drink cans; this method facilitates disassembly.|$|E

The first containers were supplied by Brown, where McLean met Keith Tantlinger, and hired him as vice-president of engineering and research. Under the supervision of Tantlinger, a new 35 ft x 8 ft x 8 ft Sea-Land container was developed, the length determined by the maximum length of trailers then allowed on Pennsylvanian highways.

Just like Pan-Atlantic's containers, Matson's were 8 ft wide and 8 ft high, but due to California's different traffic code, Matson chose to make theirs 24 ft long. In 1968, McLean began container service to South Vietnam for the US military with great success.|$|E
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} method of {{locating}} and recognizing lockholes in shipping container <b>corner</b> <b>castings.</b> This method converts the original image of the containers captured by a camera into the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space. To reduce {{the influence of the}} surface color of the containers and lights from the environment on the locating and recognizing algorithm, most noisy points of the image are filtered by binarization and a morphology opening operation to make the features of the containers clearer in the image. Thus, the container body can be separated from the total image. Then, the position and size of the <b>corner</b> <b>castings</b> are defined through calculation based on the international standard of the shipping container size. Lastly, by using this method, we can locate the corner casting in the image by using the General Hough Transform fitting algorithm onto ellipses...|$|E
30|$|A {{small-scale}} intermodal {{freight train}} {{system has been}} implemented in Switzerland. Innovatrain - a liner train with stops at many terminals over short distances - is a push‐pull train capable of operating in either direction [21]. It can either run on the electrical main track, at speeds up to 120  km/h, or drive into a private railway siding by using its diesel power. For horizontal transhipment, the ContainerMover system is used, between the train and the truck. The device is mounted on the truck, which makes transhipment possible at every terminal, or small terminal/ siding. Another system for horizontal transfer of unit loads is the CarConTrain (CCT), consisting of a wagon that travels parallel with the track, equipped with arms for transferring freight horizontally [28]. The system can transfer unit loads fitted with <b>corner</b> <b>castings</b> from 2.5 to 3.6 metres wide and 3 to 12 metres long. Since it can be fully automated, {{it could be used}} in unmanned terminals and warehouses. The train can be unloaded regardless of whether the truck is available and can arrive at any time, since no personnel are required. The terminal cost can be reduced and thus the cost of the overall transport chain.|$|E
