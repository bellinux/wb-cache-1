25|$|In {{the field}} of health care, various {{measures}} were introduced to improve the quality and availability of health care provision. Free hospital care was introduced for 9 million recipients of social relief, while a contributory medical service for 23 million panel patients was introduced. Pensioners were exempted from paying a 2% health insurance contribution, while improvements in health insurance provision were carried out, as characterised by an expanded sickness insurance scheme, with the inclusion of preventative treatment. The income limit for compulsory sickness insurance was indexed to changes in the wage level (1970) and the right to medical cancer screening for 23.5 million people was introduced. In January 1971, the reduction of sickness allowance in case of hospitalisation was discontinued. That same year, <b>compulsory</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> was extended to the self-employed. In 1970, the government included nonmedical psychotherapists and psychoanalysts in the national health insurance program.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide range}} of social reforms were carried out during Moro's periods as prime minister. The 1967 Ponte Law (Legge Ponte) {{introduced}} urgent housing provisions {{as part of an}} envisioned reform of the entire sector, such as the introduction of minimum standards for housing and environment. A law promulgated on 14 December 1963 introduced an annual allowance for university students with income below a given level. Another law, promulgated on 10 March 1968, introduced voluntary public pre-elementary education for children aged three to five years. A law promulgated on 21 July 1965 introduced new pension provisions under the general scheme. The legal minima was raised, all current pensions were revalued, seniority pensions (pensioni d’anzianità) were introduced (after 35 years of contributions workers could retire even before attaining pensionable age), and within the national social security institution (Istituto nazionale della previdenza sociale), a Social Fund (Fondo Sociale) was established, ensuring to all members pensioners a basic uniform pension largely financed by state, known as the social pension (not related to the later social pension introduced in 1968). A law of 22 July 1966 extended pension insurance to small traders. A law of 22 July 1966 extended health insurance to retired traders, and a law of 29 May 1967 extended <b>compulsory</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> to retired farmers, tenant farmers, and sharecroppers, and extended health insurance to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits. A law of 18 March 1968 introduced the principle of earnings-related pensions within the general scheme, with the pension formula to equal 1.626% of average earnings in the last 3 years of work multiplied by the number of contribution years (maximum pension: 65% of previous earnings) up to 40. A law of 5 November 1968 extended family allowances to the unemployed in receipt of unemployment benefits.|$|E

2500|$|UKIP {{has placed}} great {{emphasis}} {{on the issue of}} immigration to the UK, and in 2013 Farage described it as [...] "the biggest single issue facing this party". UKIP attributes UK membership of the EU as the core cause of immigration to the UK, citing the Union's open-border policies as the reason why large numbers of East European migrants have moved to Britain. On their campaign billboards, UKIP have presented EU migrants as a source of crime, as well as a pressure on housing, the welfare state, and the health service. Farage has emphasised not only the economic impact of migration but also the public anxieties regarding the cultural changes brought by immigration. In its 2009 electoral manifesto, UKIP proposed a five-year ban on any migrants coming to the UK. By 2015, it had modified this to the view that the five-year ban should apply only to unskilled migrants. To regulate the arrival of skilled migrants, it called for the UK to adopt a points-based system akin to that employed by Australia. It advocated the establishment of a watchdog to help curb immigration, and bring the levels of net annual immigration down from the hundreds of thousands to between 20,000 and 50,000, which was the average level in the UK between 1950 and 2000. UKIP calls for all immigrants to require <b>compulsory</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance,</b> and proposes that migrants be barred from claiming any state benefits until they had been resident in the UK for at least five years.|$|E

2500|$|Under Part 1 of the National Insurance Act 1911, <b>compulsory</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> was {{provided}} for workers {{earning less than}} £160 per year. The scheme was contributed to by the worker who contributed fourpence, the employer who contributed threepence and the government who contributed twopence. The scheme provided sickness benefit entitlement of nine shillings (£36), free medical treatment and maternity benefit of 30 shillings (£120). An estimated 13million workers came to be compulsorily covered under this scheme. Part 2 of the National Insurance Act passed in 1911 gave workers the right to sick pay of 9s a week and free medical treatment {{in return for a}} payment for 4d a week. Sick pay would be paid for 26 weeks of sickness. The medical treatment {{was provided}} by doctors who belonged to a [...] "panel" [...] in each district. Doctors received a fee from the insurance fund for each [...] "panel" [...] patient they treated. The National Insurance Act (Part II) gave workers the right to unemployment pay of 7s 6d a week for 15 weeks in return for a payment of 2½d a week. Under Part 2 of the National Insurance Act 1911, which dealt with unemployment insurance, most insured workers were given seven shillings in unemployment benefit which could be claimed for up to 15 weeks a year. This scheme was also financed through the contributions of workers and government. Although only a minority of workers were insured by this scheme, it nevertheless covered a number of trades and industries, such as shipbuilding, which were particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in employment.|$|E

40|$|From January to February 2007 170 general {{practitioners}} {{settled in}} Aachen were interviewed about the topics quality management and marketing. 105 questionnaires {{were taken into}} account for the evaluation (quote of return 61. 9 %). The group consisted of 31 women and 73 men aged between 35 and 67 years. The majority of the interviewees showed a negative attitude towards the topic quality management. 72. 8 % (n= 75) considered that medical quality {{does not depend on}} quality management and 54. 9 % (n= 56) did not see any improvement in organising their medical practice. Moreover, 73. 1 % (n= 76) saw no need for quality management in outpatient centres. Only 25. 2 % of the interviewees (n= 26) had a certification in quality management. Additionally, there is a divergent point of view concerning the subject marketing: 64. 4 % (n= 67) rated marketing as reasonable in their medical practice but only 30. 1 % (n= 23) identified a rise in their patients' contentment and 46. 6 % (n= 48) saw the chance to raise their business volume. The majority of 79 % (n= 83) claimed to offer medical services in their medical practices which were not covered by <b>compulsory</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurances</b> and 44. 1 % (n= 45) planned to expand their offer. Furthermore, 75. 2 % (n= 79) of the general practitioners had additional qualifications and 37. 1 % (n= 39) planned to extend their qualifications. 21. 2 % (n= 22) used the internet in order to offer medical attendance and 25 % (n= 26) were using an automatic recall-system to remind their patients of immunisations, screenings etc. {{at the time of the}} evaluation. In addition, 32. 7 % (n= 34) indicated to own a homepage of their medical practice and 27. 6 % (n= 29) planned to establish one soon. Looking at the subgroups of this sample, one has to acknowledge that there were little significant coherences to the given answers. Only age seems to be important, especially with regard to the topic marketing. Thus, younger general practitioners (up to 50 years) do significant more advertisements (p= 0. 047) and have significantly more often a homepage for their medical practice (p= 0. 01). Furthermore, they planned significantly more often to extend their medical services which were not covered by <b>compulsory</b> <b>health</b> <b>insurances</b> (p= 0. 036), to gain additional qualifications (p= 0. 001) and to introduce patient surveys (p= 0. 006) ...|$|R

40|$|A Responsibility of the State?: Social Security, the German Occupation and the Introduction of <b>Compulsory</b> Social <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> in the Netherlands, 1939 - 1949 In historiography the Sickness Funds Decree (1941) {{has always}} been portrayed as either being a Dutch or a German product.

The German {{occupier}} was able {{to break through the}} political stalemate that had delayed the introduction of social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> during the previous decades. However the German authorities could not completely bypass Dutch ideas. The initial farreaching proposal was blocked by combined resistance from Dutch civil servants and ‘Berlin’. After the war, the restored Dutch government proposed a Beveridgemodel of social security, with the state at the centre of power. This proposal was rejected since the general feeling was against the state controlling <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> The Sickness Funds Decree seemed to be better suited to this mood.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{supplemental}} <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> on health-care consumption crucially depend on specific institutional {{features of the}} health-care system. We analyse the situation in Belgium, {{a country with a}} very broad coverage in <b>compulsory</b> social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> and where supplemental insurance mainly refers to extra-billing in hospitals. Within this institutional background, we find only weak evidence of adverse selection in the coverage of supplemental <b>health</b> <b>insurance.</b> We find much stronger effects of socio-economic background. We estimate a bivariate probit model and cannot reject the assumption of exogeneity of insurance availability for the explanation of health-care use. A count model for hospital care shows that supplemental insurance has no significant effect on the number of spells, but a negative effect on the number of nights per spell. We comment on the implications of our findings for equality of access to health care in Belgium. Copyrigh...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{opens with}} the {{statement}} that the Belgian health care system finds itself nowadays in a paradoxical position as the favourable appreciation of its performance and high quality level resulting from both international comparisons and recent national enquiries among the Belgian population on the one hand, and the significant growth of the <b>compulsory</b> <b>health</b> assurance budgets {{over the past few years}} on the other hand, strikingly contrast with far less positive aspects of the actual situa- tion mainly reflected by the ever increasing burden of health care costs to be supported by patients, by serious accessibility problems for some categories of the population and by an overall feeling of dissatisfaction among health care providers.

40|$|According to Hirschmann's {{concept of}} exit and voice, people have two options {{to make sure}} that firms or organisations realise what they (their {{consumers}} or members) are interested in (Hirschmann 1970).

In this paper the authors examine the introduciton of exit in the Dutch <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system and discuss the combination of exit and voice. Until the early 1990 -s consumers in Dutch <b>compulsory</b> social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> did not have the exit option. There was no consumer choice between sickness funds. However, sickness funds were the focal point of Dutch health system reforms in the early 1990 s. Giving the insured free choice between sickness funds was supposed to bring about competition that would at the same time favour quality through selective contracting by sickness funds and curb costs through incentives for efficiency (Gress 2002). The possibility to use voice - for example, through the 'Council of Insured" or by filing a complaint - remained unchanged throughout the reforms. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
