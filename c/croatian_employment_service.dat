40|$|The aim {{of a human}} {{resources}} management model in the function of regional development is to provide effective mediation in the labour market achieved by increasing the quality of service adjusted to the clients` needs, along {{with the development of}} knowledge, skills and abilities of everyone involved in {{human resources}} management. They should also continuously improve partnership relations with all the stakeholders in the labour market. A leading {{role in the development of}} the Croatian labour market, particularly when it comes to balancing the total labour supply and demand aimed at increasing employment is played by the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> (CES). The CES follows the strategic goals of regional development. The <b>Croatian</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> has the following strategic goals: - to develop the services provided by the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> in order to stimulate workforce competition and address the labour market needs. - to develop human potential and administrative capacity of the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> in creation and provision of new services in the labour market - to achieve a leading role of the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> in the labour market by stimulating partnership and increasing its impact on adopting and realizing public policies. In the current economic crisis the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> has reconfirmed its conviction that investment in human resources is the crucial measure aimed at increasing employability through acquiring knowledge and skills in demand on the labour market. The other side of this issue is the need to prevent the loss of skills resulting from long periods of unemployment. It is possible to notice three different approaches in raising and allocating resources for financing regional development, which is explained on the example of one of the economically most developed regional (local) selfgovernment units. In spite of having common development goals, local selfgovernments proceed differently in carrying out these tasks. Funding of public needs through public-private partnership (PPP) is motivated primarily by limited availability of public financing, together with the endeavours to improve the quality and efficiency of public services. Contracting projects by means of PPP should be seen as one of the possibilities if project characteristics allow for such a model, and if clear advantages and benefits can be demonstrated in comparison with traditional procurement methods. Furthermore, we should point out overcoming limitations in funding, involving private sector in the construction of public infrastructure and provision of public services, stimulating innovation in public services, and increasing consumer satisfaction. Public-private partnerships are very complex in terms of design, management and implementation, which indicates that everybody should be very cautious regarding this model, even though it could provide a range of advantages. Taking into account that these are normally long-term projects, there is a possibility that expected benefits are not realized. In view of this, special precautions should be taken when contracting such projects so as to avoid possible deterioration of public services. Within the international monetary system, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, together with their affiliates, are indispensable financial institutions that play a crucial role in handling financial problems in the world, particularly in underdeveloped and developing countries. Some major goals of these institutions are establishing economic stability around the world, financing the members that have encountered different economic difficulties, and providing counselling in order to re-establish macroeconomic balance. The cooperation between these two institutions and Croatia takes place mostly through their granting different arrangements (usually stand-by arrangements), loans and donations. The European Union provides some other important sources of financing for the regional development, in particular through credit institutions, funds and non-monetary financial institutions. regionalni razvoj, modeli financiranja...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} flexibility in labor market, changes in the employment practice, {{and the arrival of}} aging society, it is necessary for individuals to develop their career throughout their life. It is increasingly emphasized that government is responsible to support career development of all in order to improve nation's competitiveness as well as the well-being of individuals. In these context, in 2005, ministry of Labor presented a plan to innovate the <b>employment</b> <b>services.</b> One of the core tasks of the innovation plan was to activate and to certify private <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> to ensure the quality of <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> provided by private agencies.

This paper presents the analysis of the effects of non-formal learning activities that are conducted at the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> in the form of workshops, with an aim of raising employability among unemployed people. The participants in this research were unemployed persons who attended workshops at the Regional Office of the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> Zadar during the year 2013. This survey focuses on evaluation of effects of non-formal learning through workshops within groups of unemployed persons, depending on their age, gender and level of education. As the forms of non-formal education indicate organized learning activities with the aim of acquiring and improving knowledge, skills and competences for personal, social and professional needs, the {{aim of this}} study is to define the role of non-formal education as a positive aspect of employability or set of knowledge, expertise and ability of a person. The results of attending the workshops can potentially include retaining one’s job, career progress, obtaining a new job and assuring the entrance to the labour market in different periods of the working life cycle...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{analyze the}} {{physician}} labor market in Croatia {{with respect to}} the internship and employment opportunities, Croatian needs for physicians and specialists, and trends in physician labor market in the European Union (EU) in the context of EU enlargement. Methods: Data were collected from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service,</b> and the Croatian Institute for Public Health. We compared the number of physicians waiting for internship before and 14 months after the implementation of the State Program for Intern Employment Stimulation. Also, the number of employed specialists in internal medicine, general surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, and pediatrics was compared with estimated number of specialists that will have been needed by the end of 2007. Average age of hospital physicians in the four specialties was determined and the number of Croatian physicians compared with the number of physicians in EU countries. Results: The number of unemployed physicians waiting for internship decreased from 335 in 2003 to 82 in 2004, while a total number of unemployed physicians decreased from 436 to 379 (χ 2 = 338, P< 0. 001). In October 2004, 79. 3 % of unemployed physicians waited for internship < 6 months; of them, 89. 2 % waited for internship < 3 months. In February 2005, 365 unemployed physicians were registered at the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> and that number has been decreasing {{in the last couple of}} years. The number of employed specialists was lower than the estimated number of specialists needed in the analyzed specialists, as defined by the prescribed standards. A shortage of 328 internists, 319 surgeons, 209 gynecologists, and 69 pediatricians in Croatian hospitals is expected in 2007. Conclusion: The lack of employment incentive seems to be the main reason for the large number of unemployed physicians waiting for internship before the implementation of the Employment Stimulation Program. According to the number of physicians per 100000 population, Croatia is below the EU average. Croatian labor market will not be able to meet the needs of the health system for physicians by the end of 2007...|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{efficiency}} of the matching process by panel stochastic frontier estimation of the matching function in Croatia. The empirical analysis is conducted on a regional level using regional office-level monthly data obtained from the <b>Croatian</b> <b>Employment</b> <b>Service</b> for 2000 – 2011. The results suggest that {{the efficiency of}} the matching process is rising over time, although with significant regional variations. In order to explore these variations, structural characteristics of the labour market together with some policy variables are included in the second-stage estimation. Various structural variables have different impact on the matching efficiency, while policy variables are mostly positively correlated with it. For instance, both active labour market programs and the number of high-skilled employees in regional employment offices positively affect matching efficiency. Additionally, when regional income per capita is included in the model, it shows positive impact on the matching efficiency, indicating that demand fluctuations predominantly affect the matching process. Finally, in order to get consistent estimates, panel stochastic frontier model transformation is applied. The obtained results show that there is no major difference in estimated mean technical efficiency coefficients in comparison to the original estimation. ...|$|E

Krounauer model of social excluasion was taken as the base for interpretation of riskfactors related to unemployment. Mentioned model is defi ned with six dimesions: exclusion from labour market, economic exclusion,social isolation, institutional exclusion, spatial and cultural exclusion. Five focus groups with 19 unemployed youth (age from 18 to 27 years) from 4 cities in Croatia and from two types of institutions (<b>croatian</b> <b>employment</b> <b>service</b> and center for social welfare) havebeen conducted.

40|$|Australian {{historical}} {{scholarship has}} traditionally neglected public <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> {{as an area}} of research. However, {{in recent years as}} the State has repositioned itself in the labour market the role of public <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> has become a popular area of debate. While contemporary scholars have contributed to these debates, their historical counterparts have been slower to follow suit. In overcoming this neglect, this thesis provides an historical examination of one of the earliest forms of state intervention into the Australian labour market: public <b>employment</b> <b>services.</b> This study examined the establishment and operations of public <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> in NSW from 1887 until 1942, when they were transferred across to the Federal Department of Labour and National Service, to comply with Commonwealth Wartime legislation. Within the Australian contemporary scholarship, public <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> have been conceptualised according to three dominant economic traditions: neo-classical economics, Keynesian economics and the writings of W. H. Beveridge. However, these traditions are predicated on inherent assumptions and predetermined outcomes, all of which fail to identify the origins and development of public <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> in Australia. Neo-classical economists have been the most critical arguing that the public provision of <b>employments</b> <b>services</b> is both inefficient and ineffective. Within the historical literature, Institutional economists in the United States have been influential in identifying the socio-economic factors that {{led to the development of}} the public employment services: asymmetrical labour market information and fraudulent acts perpetrated by private employment registries, all of which distorted the functioning of the labour market. By adopting the institutional economic approach, this thesis found that it was these socio-economic concerns that led to the introduction of the public <b>employment</b> <b>service</b> in NSW. This thesis disputes the claims of the neo-classical economists that the public <b>employment</b> <b>services</b> were both inefficient and ineffective, instead it argues that the public <b>employment</b> <b>service</b> played a pivotal role in the development of the NSW economy performing the role of labour market intermediary: channelling information and bringing together those wishing to buy and sell labour; while safeguarding those vulnerable in the labour market: the unemployed...|$|R
