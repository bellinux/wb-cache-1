We argue that the phase-sensitive component of the decoherence rate may explain the anomalous features observed in a recent experiment by Avinun-Kalish et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 156801 (2004)).

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 High speed photodetectors are a {{necessary}} element in broad band digital and analog optical communication systems. In this thesis easily integrable planar high speed photodetectors made on undoped semi-insulating (SI) GaAs substrates are modeled and tested. The fabrication {{process of the}} detectors is fully compatible with GaAs metal-semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET) processing technology. Interdigitated fingers are used as the contacts to achieve both high sensitivity and large bandwidth. Detectors made with both ohmic and Schottky contacts are fabricated and tested. The equivalent circuit elements of the interdigitated structure are modeled using accurate lumped element circuit models associated with the various discontinuities of the structure. The results of the model agree well with the experimental results {{as well as with}} other published results. Numerical simulation of the SI-GaAs metal-semiconductor- metal (MSM) photodetector is performed. The carriers are tracked after an ideal optical pulse is applied and the intrinsic current as a function of time is computed. Then the influence of all the external circuit elements is included and the output current across the load resistor is computed. The simulated response is compared with other published models. The electrical and optical characteristics of the detectors are measured. For ohmic contact detectors, the dark current increases linearly with bias until some critical field is reached beyond which the dark current increases nonlinearly with bias. The time response of the detectors is measured with a 10 ps pulsed laser operating at - 600 nm and also with a pulsed GaAs /AlGaAs semiconductor laser operating at 850 nm. The ohmic and Schottky contact detectors have approximately the same rise time. The fall time of the Schottky <b>contact</b> <b>detector</b> is much smaller than the fall time of ohmic <b>contact</b> <b>detector.</b> The long fall time of the ohmic detector does not depend on the spacing between contacts.

Our previous tests with IMARAD CZT showed that the use of indium anodes and gold cathode improved the resistivity compared to the standard indium-contacted detectors.

Qubit readout typically involves spin to charge information conversion, followed by a charge measurement made using a nearby biased quantum point contact. It is critical to understand the back-action disturbances resulting from such a measurement approach. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} quantum point <b>contact</b> <b>detectors</b> emit phonons which are then absorbed by nearby qubits. We report here the observation of a pronounced back-action effect in multiple dot circuits where the absorption of detector-generated phonons is strongly modified by a quantum interference effect, and show that the phenomenon is well described by a theory incorporating both the quantum point contact and coherent phonon absorption. Our combined experimental and theoretical results suggest strategies to suppress back-action during the qubit readout procedure. Comment: 25 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is {{observed}} in magnetic insulator|heavy metal bilayers as an inverse spin Hall effect voltage under a temperature gradient. The SSE {{can be detected}} nonlocally as well, viz. {{in terms of the}} voltage in a second metallic <b>contact</b> (<b>detector)</b> on the magnetic film, spatially separated from the first contact that is used to apply the temperature bias (injector). Magnon-polarons are hybridized lattice and spin waves in magnetic materials, generated by the magnetoelastic interaction. Kikkawa et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 207203 (2016) ] interpreted a resonant enhancement of the local SSE in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) {{as a function of the}} magnetic field in terms of magnon-polaron formation. Here we report the observation of magnon-polarons in nonlocal magnon spin injection/detection devices for various injector-detector spacings and sample temperatures. Unexpectedly, we find that the magnon-polaron resonances can suppress rather than enhance the nonlocal SSE. Using finite element modelling we explain our observations as a competition between the SSE and spin diffusion in YIG. These results give unprecedented insights into the magnon-phonon interaction in a key magnetic material. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a {{feedback control loop}} rectifying particle transport through a single quantum dot that is coupled to two electronic leads. While monitoring the occupation of the dot, we apply conditional control operations by changing the tunneling rates between the dots and its reservoirs, which {{can be interpreted as}} the action of a Maxwell demon opening or closing a shutter. This can generate a current at equilibrium or even against a potential bias, producing electric power from information. While this interpretation is well-explored in the weak-coupling limit, we can address the strong-coupling regime with a fermionic reaction-coordinate mapping, which maps the system into a serial triple quantum dot coupled to two leads. There, we find that a continuous projective measurement of the central dot would lead to a complete suppression of electronic transport due to the quantum Zeno effect. In contrast, a microscopic model for the quantum point <b>contact</b> <b>detector</b> implements a weak measurement, which allows for closure of the control loop without inducing transport blockade. In the weak-coupling regime between the central dot and its leads, the energy flows associated with the feedback loop are negligible, and the information gained in the measurement induces a bound for the generated electric power. In contrast, in the strong coupling limit, the protocol may require more energy for opening and closing the shutter than electric power produced, such that the device is no longer information-dominated and can thus not be interpreted as a Maxwell demon.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{statistical}} properties of currents in two particular systems of capacitively coupled parallel transport channels. In the first system, each transport channel contains a single quantum dot {{in contact with}} two electron reservoirs. The second system we study is constituted of a double quantum dot coupled to two electrodes and probed by a quantum point <b>contact</b> <b>detector.</b> Thermodynamic forces are applied to each transport channel that generate fluctuating stationary currents. The full counting statistics of the currents is obtained starting from a microscopic Hamiltonian describing the electron dynamics. We verify that the joined probability distribution of the currents in each channel satisfies a fluctuation theorem in the long-time limit. The issue of single-current fluctuation theorems for the marginal distribution of the currents {{in one of the}} two channels is also investigated. We show that in the limit of large current ratio between both channels, a single-current fluctuation theorem is satisfied individually for the slower circuit in agreement with experimental observations. This theorem involves an effective affinity which depends on the thermodynamic forces applied to both channels and the specific features of the system considered. A detailed study of the effective affinity is made for the two aforementioned systems. Besides, we introduce a criteria on the initial condition of the transport channels for the observation of a fluctuation theorem at any time. This criteria is extended to the case of single-current fluctuation theorems. Finally, we perform the nonequilibrium thermodynamic analysis of a double quantum dot probed by a quantum point contact in the presence of temperature and chemical potential differences between the electrodes. A thermal machine is studied and shown to reach highest efficiencies at maximum power by fine tuning the double quantum dot spectrum. Comment: 161 page...|$|E

40|$|High-purity {{germanium}} (HPGe) radiation detectors {{are well}} {{established as a}} valuable tool in nuclear science, astrophysics, and nuclear security applications. HPGe detectors excel in gamma-ray spectroscopy, offering excellent energy resolution with large detector sizes for high radiation detection efficiency. Although a robust fabrication process has been developed, improvement is needed, especially in developing electrical contact and surface passivation technology for position-sensitive detectors. A systematic study is needed {{to understand how the}} detector fabrication process impacts detector performance and reliability. In order to provide position sensitivity, the electrical contacts are segmented to form multiple electrodes. This segmentation creates new challenges in the fabrication process and warrants consideration of additional detector effects related to the segmentation. A key area of development is the creation of the electrical contacts in a way that enables reliable operation, provides low electronic noise, and allows fine segmentation of electrodes, giving position sensitivity for radiation interactions in the detector. Amorphous semiconductor contacts have great potential to facilitate new HPGe detector designs by providing a thin, high-resistivity surface coating that is the basis for electrical contacts that block both electrons and holes and can easily be finely segmented. Additionally, amorphous semiconductor coatings form a suitable passivation layer to protect the HPGe crystal surface from contamination. This versatility allows a simple fabrication process for fully passivated, finely segmented detectors. However, the fabrication process for detectors with amorphous semiconductors is not as highly developed as for conventional technologies. The amorphous semiconductor layer properties can vary widely based on how they are created and these can translate into varying performance of HPGe detectors with these contacts. Some key challenges include minimizing charge injection leakage current, increasing the long-term stability of the contacts, and achieving good charge collection properties in segmented detectors. A systematic study of contact characteristics is presented where amorphous germanium (a-Ge) and amorphous silicon (a-Si) contacts are sputtered with varying sputter gas hydrogen content, sputter gas pressure, and amorphous film thickness. A set of about 45 detectors fabricated from 11 different crystal samples were analyzed for electron barrier height and effective Richardson constant. Most of these detectors were subjected to as many as 10 temperature cycles over a period of up to several months in order to assess their long-term stability. Additionally, 6 double-sided strip detectors were fabricated with a-Ge and a-Si contacts in order to study their inter-electrode charge collection properties. An attempt is made to relate fabrication process parameters such as hydrogen content, sputter pressure, and film thickness to changes observed in detector performance and assess the level of reproducibility using the current methods. Several important results and conclusions were found that enable more reliable and highly performing detectors with amorphous semiconductor contacts. Utilizing the new information should enable consistent production of finely segmented detectors with excellent energy resolution that can be operated reliably {{for a long period of}} time. The passivation process could impact planar detectors as well as other designs, such as the p-type point <b>contact</b> <b>detector.</b> It is demonstrated that the long-term stability of amorphous semiconductor contacts is primarily dependent on the time the detector is at room temperature rather than the number of temperature cycles. For a-Ge contacts, higher sputter pressure yields a more stable process that changes little with time, giving a reliable hole-blocking contact. The a-Si contacts form a good electron-blocking contact with decreasing leakage current over time. Both materials, when 7 % hydrogen is included in the argon sputter gas, show acceptable levels of inter-electrode charge collection to be useful for strip electrode detectors...|$|E
