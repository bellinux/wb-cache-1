25|$|Among the mammals {{native to}} the region is the <b>culpeo</b> or Andean fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus)-in the region, is called red fox-, which {{is in danger of}} extinction. They share this region with 30 other species of mammals, {{including}} the puma (Felis concolor), classified as vulnerable; the colocolo (Oncifelis colocolo); the ferret (Mustela furax); and Geoffroy's cat (Oncifelis geoffroyi).|$|E
25|$|In South America, {{the only}} {{widespread}} potential predators of sheep are cougars and jaguars, {{both of which}} are known to prey on livestock regularly. South American canids such as the Maned wolf and foxes of the genus Pseudalopex are also blamed for sheep deaths, but no evidence for a statistically significant amount of predation by most of these species has ever been presented. However, the <b>culpeo</b> is a threat to sheep, and is responsible for 60% of the predator losses in Patagonia.|$|E

50|$|The park's forests provide {{habitat for}} {{wildlife}} such as pumas, chillas, <b>culpeos,</b> pudúes, coypus, Harris's hawks, lesser grisons, Molina's hog-nosed skunks, and the rare monitos del monte.|$|R
50|$|The local mammals in {{the area}} are mainly pumas, <b>culpeos,</b> chillas, the quique (kind of weasel) and the kodkod (wild cat). The bird species found in the park goes from a large {{varieties}} of ducks, condors, traros, eagles, and wood pigeon.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the size}} of the park, there is a large {{selection}} of fauna located within the nature reserve. 500 species of bird along with anteaters, sloths, ocelots, <b>culpeos,</b> and deer are commonly found in the park. Due to lakes and rivers of the park, many aquatic and amphibious animals are found there.|$|R
50|$|Where their ranges overlap, the South American gray fox is in {{competition}} with the larger <b>culpeo</b> fox. The former consumes {{a greater proportion of}} rodents, and arthropods make a significant portion of its diet, while the <b>culpeo</b> tends to consume larger prey including the non-native European hare which has been introduced into Chile. These prey animals are partitioned between these two species, with the gray fox being excluded from the best prey territories by the larger <b>culpeo.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Río Clarillo National Reserve lies 45 km {{southeast}} of Santiago {{in the valley}} of the Clarillo River. The 10 km Sendero de Chile trail runs from the reserve’s El Maitén sector to the Corral de las Yeguas sector. Points of interest include a viewpoint overlooking the Clarillo valley and stands of native cacti, soap bark trees, peumo trees and Lithraea caustica trees. It is also possible to view <b>culpeos</b> and South American gray foxes.|$|R
50|$|Popular Conguillío National Park {{is located}} {{approximately}} 70 km {{east of the}} city of Temuco and this trail runs 54 km round Llaima Volcano north from the Salto de Truful Truful waterfall to the Laguna Captren lake. It is possible to see a wide variety of wildlife in the park, including pumas, South American grey foxes, <b>culpeos,</b> lesser grisons, kodkods, pudús, viscachas and coypos. Birds living in the area include eagles, condors and Magellanic woodpeckers.|$|R
40|$|Goat {{husbandry}} is {{the main}} rural livelihood in the northern Patagonian steppe of Argentina, and herders kill any carnivore that they believe threatens their herds, including the endangered Andean cat (Leopardus jacobita). We evaluated the use of local, mediumsized, mixed-breed guarding dogs to reduce predation and retaliatory killing of carnivores. We interviewed 64 herders, and delivered 37 puppies to 25 herders. Most economic loss was attributed to cougars (Puma concolor) and <b>culpeos</b> (Lycalopex culpaeus). All herders with dogs that reached the working stage reported reduced rates of predation, and 88 % reported {{that they no longer}} kill carnivores. Among herders who were not using dogs, 89 % of them reported increased predation, and 100 % of them confirmed that they kill carnivores. Mixedbreed dogs can be effective in reducing both predation losses and retaliatory killing, but their success depends on the ability and willingness of herders to train and use them properly...|$|R
50|$|The <b>culpeo</b> (Lycalopex culpaeus), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the zorro <b>culpeo</b> or Andean fox (wolf), is a South American fox species. It is the second largest native canid on the continent, after the maned wolf. In appearance, it bears many similarities to the widely recognized red fox. It has grey and reddish fur, a white chin, reddish legs, and a stripe on its back that may be barely visible.|$|E
50|$|The <b>culpeo</b> was domesticated to {{form the}} Fuegian dog, but this became extinct some time between 1880 and 1919.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is home to}} a {{wide variety}} of wildlife, {{including}} the cougar and foxes (particularly the chilla and the <b>culpeo).</b> In the park have been identified 47 bird species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>culpeo</b> {{lives in}} a wide variety of {{habitats}} of western South America. They are found in broadleaf Nothofagus temperate rainforest, sclerophyllous matorral, deserts, and high plateaus, like the Altiplano, up to the tree line (4800 m).|$|E
50|$|The Andean goose (Chloephaga melanoptera) is {{resident}} {{around the}} lakes in the Vacas Municipality. Viscacha, <b>culpeo</b> (Pseudalopex culpaeus), {{also known as}} the Andean fox, skunk, guinea pig, owl, falcon, tinamou (Tinamidae, Nothoprocta spp.) and viper are typical representatives of the fauna.|$|E
5000|$|In 1880, {{after the}} animal became extinct, Thomas Huxley {{classified}} it {{as related to}} the coyote. In 1914, Oldfield Thomas moved it to the genus Dusicyon, with the <b>culpeo</b> and other South American foxes. (These other canids have since been removed to Lycalopex.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{official}} mascot of the tournament, a young <b>culpeo</b> fox, {{was unveiled}} on 17 November 2014. The {{name of the}} mascot, [...] "Zincha" [...] (from Zorro (fox) and hINCHA (fan)), was chosen by the public over two other options, [...] "Andi" [...] and [...] "Kul".|$|E
50|$|The fog oasis at Paposo {{has more}} plant species {{than any other}} fog oasis in Chile, {{counting}} at least 250 species of vascular plants. Wildlife in the fog oasis includes the guanaco and two species of foxes, the <b>culpeo</b> (Andean fox) and the South American gray fox.|$|E
50|$|The {{main reason}} for setting up the {{biosphere}} reserve was to protect vicuñas. Also present in the reserve are the guanaco, the <b>culpeo</b> fox, the Andean mountain cat, the cougar, the southern viscacha, the short-tailed chinchilla, the Darwin's rhea, various ducks and geese, and the Andean condor.|$|E
50|$|The <b>culpeo</b> fox is an {{opportunistic}} predator {{that will}} take any variety of prey. This fox mainly feeds on rodents and lagomorphs (especially the introduced European rabbit and European hare); however, it occasionally feeds on domestic livestock and young guanacos. Culpeos are considered beneficial because they are significant predators of the rabbits introduced in 1915; such introduced rabbit populations {{are believed to have}} allowed culpeos to spread from the Andean foothills across the Patagonian plain. They sometimes take young lambs up to a week old. In limited studies, the larger <b>culpeo</b> appears to dominate potential competitors, including South American gray foxes, Geoffroy's cats, Pampas cats, grisons and various raptorial birds. Its range also overlaps that of the much larger puma, but the size difference ensures that the two species have limited competition.|$|E
50|$|The Fuegian dog (perro yagán, perro fueguino), {{also known}} as the Yaghan dog, is an extinct domesticated canid. It was a domesticated form of the <b>culpeo,</b> Lycalopex culpaeus, unlike other domesticated canids - dogs, domesticated from the gray wolf Canis lupus, and the domesticated fox, from the red fox Vulpes vulpes.|$|E
50|$|The culpeo's diet {{consists}} {{largely of}} rodents, rabbits, birds and lizards, {{and to a}} lesser extent, plant material and carrion. The <b>culpeo</b> does attack sheep on occasion, and is therefore often hunted or poisoned. In some regions it has become rare, but overall the species is not threatened with extinction.|$|E
50|$|Among the mammals {{native to}} the region is the <b>culpeo</b> or Andean fox (Pseudalopex culpaeus)-in the region, is called red fox-, which {{is in danger of}} extinction. They share this region with 30 other species of mammals, {{including}} the puma (Felis concolor), classified as vulnerable; the colocolo (Oncifelis colocolo); the ferret (Mustela furax); and Geoffroy's cat (Oncifelis geoffroyi).|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} in {{the park}} is mostly low spiny shrubs adapted for living in arid environments; these include Caesalpinia gilliesii, Berberis microphylla, Arthrophyllum rigidum, Chiliotrichum diffusum, Mulinum spinosum and Fragaria chiloensis. The flightless lesser rhea is known from the park and mammals present include the guanaco, the dwarf armadillo, the <b>culpeo</b> fox and the South American gray fox.|$|E
50|$|Large birds {{such as the}} Andean condor and {{variable}} hawk are commonplace in the skies above the reserve. Spectacled bears, foxes, and deer {{are some of the}} larger animals of the reserve. Páramo rabbits and armadillos are among the smaller fauna. There are 106 species of mammals, including the mountain tapir, cougar and <b>culpeo,</b> 395 species of birds, 70 reptiles, and 116 amphibians.|$|E
50|$|The guanaco is {{the main}} mammal found in the park. Other mammals include <b>culpeo</b> fox, chilla fox and European hare. The {{shoreline}} area is home to marine mammals, such as the marine otter and the South American sea lion. Among the birds are the Humboldt penguin and Peruvian pelican. Also reptile species of the genera Tropidurus and Callopistes inhabit the park.|$|E
50|$|Its {{distribution}} {{extends from}} Ecuador and Peru {{to the southern}} regions of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. Some populations live in southern regions of Colombia. It is most common on the western slopes of the Andes, where it inhabits open country and deciduous forests. Populations of the <b>culpeo</b> are also found {{in some of the}} westernmost of the Falkland Islands, where they were introduced by humans.|$|E
50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the <b>culpeo</b> {{has been the}} topic of debate due to their high phenetic variability and the scarcity of research, among other things. Over the past three decades, they have been placed variably in the genera Dusicyon (Clutton-Brock, et al., 1976; Wozencraft, 1989), Canis (Langguth, 1975; Van Gelder, 1978), Pseudalopex (Berta, 1987; Wozencraft, 1993; Tedford et al., 1995), and Lycalopex (Zunino, 1995; Wozencraft, 2005).|$|E
50|$|The fauna of the Andean Patagonian forest {{region is}} very varied with many endemic species. Predatory mammals include the cougar (Felis concolor), the <b>culpeo</b> (Lycalopex culpaeus), the {{southern}} river otter (Lontra provocax) and the Geoffroy's cat (Leopardus geoffroyi). Other mammals include Humboldt's hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus humboldtii), the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the south Andean deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and numerous species of rodents.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally it {{had been}} {{supposed}} that the most closely related genus was Lycalopex, including the <b>Culpeo,</b> which has been introduced to the Falkland Islands in modern times. However, in 2009, a cladistic analysis of DNA identified the Falkland Island wolf's closest living relative as the maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus)—an unusually long-legged, fox-like South American canid, from which it separated about 6.7 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|San Guillermo National Park (Parque Nacional San Guillermo) is a {{national}} park in Argentina, in the Iglesia Department of San Juan Province. It was established in 1999 and {{is part of the}} San Guillermo Biosphere Reserve. The highest point of the biosphere reserve is about 6000 m. It consists of grasslands, wetlands, and canyons. The animals there include vicuña, guanaco, <b>culpeo</b> fox, Andean mountain cat, cougar, and Andean condor.|$|E
5000|$|Every November, Salar de Uyuni is the {{breeding}} ground for three species of pink South American flamingo: the Chilean, Andean, and rare James's flamingos, their color presumably originating from feeding on pink algae. About 80 other bird species are present, including the horned coot, Andean goose, and Andean hillstar. The Andean fox, or <b>culpeo,</b> is also present, and [...] "islands" [...] in the Salar (in particular Incahuasi Island) host colonies of rabbit-like viscachas.|$|E
50|$|It is preyed {{on by the}} Andean {{mountain}} cat (Leopardus jacobitus), the colocolo (Leopardus colocolo), and the <b>culpeo</b> (Lycalopex culpaeus) in high-altitude desert regions. The northern viscacha is more often found on larger, steeper portions of cliffs. This preference is probably driven by a need to avoid predators, as land-based carnivores are more easily evaded on a steep slope. It rarely ventures far from rocks, as these provide a means of escaping from both aerial and terrestrial predators.|$|E
5000|$|Fuegian dogs had erect ears, sharp snout {{and a thick}} tail, tawny colored or entirely white. Surviving images {{show them}} to be a similar size to the wild <b>culpeo,</b> which weighs 5 to 13.5 kg, or {{roughly the size of}} a Shetland Sheepdog. Gauchos called Fuegian dogs [...] "maned dogs" [...] because of their {{resemblance}} to the maned wolf. Lucas Bridges described the Fuegian dog as [...] "a stunted cross between an Alsatian police dog and a wolf".|$|E
