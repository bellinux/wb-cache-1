40|$|Factors {{affecting}} <b>candicidin</b> synthesis and mycelial {{growth of}} Streptomyces griseus IMRU 3570 were studied. Inorganic phosphate {{was found to}} inhibit <b>candicidin</b> synthesis but to stimulate mycelial growth. Zinc, iron, and magnesium ions stimulated <b>candicidin</b> synthesis at relatively high concentrations in a complex medium {{but not in a}} synthetic medium. No other factors studied, such as temperature, oxygen absorption rate, and sugar concentration, were found to differentially affect antibiotic synthesis and mycelial growth. Optimum concentration of inorganic phosphate for <b>candicidin</b> synthesis in a chemically defined medium was found to be between 5 × 10 − 5 and 5 × 10 − 4 M. The culture in idiophase stage can be reverted to typical trophophase growth by the addition of inorganic phosphate, suggesting the controlling role of inorganic phosphate in repression and derepression of secondary metabolic and primary metabolic activity of the culture. With a soya peptone-glucose medium, the maximum rate of <b>candicidin</b> production could be maintained and extended for a considerable length of time by controlling the culture pH at 8. 0, using glucose to adjust the pH during the later stages of a batch fermentation.

40|$|Attine ants are {{dependent}} on a cultivated fungus for food and use antibiotics produced by symbiotic Actinobacteria as weedkillers in their fungus gardens. Actinobacterial species belonging to the genera Pseudonocardia, Streptomyces and Amycolatopsis have been isolated from attine ant nests and shown to confer protection against a range of microfungal weeds. In previous work on the higher attine Acromyrmex octospinosus we isolated a Streptomyces strain that produces <b>candicidin,</b> consistent with another report that attine ants use Streptomyces-produced <b>candicidin</b> in their fungiculture. Here we report the genome analysis of this Streptomyces strain and identify multiple antibiotic biosynthetic pathways. We demonstrate, using gene disruptions and mass spectrometry, that this single strain {{has the capacity to}} make <b>candicidin</b> and multiple antimycin compounds. Although antimycins have been known for > 60 years we report the sequence of the biosynthetic gene cluster for the first time. Crucially, disrupting the <b>candicidin</b> and antimycin gene clusters in the same strain had no effect on bioactivity against a co-evolved nest pathogen called Escovopsis that has been identified in ~ 30 % of attine ant nests. Since the Streptomyces strain has strong bioactivity against Escovopsis we conclude that it must make additional antifungal(s) to inhibit Escovopsis. However, <b>candicidin</b> and antimycins likely offer protection against other microfungal weeds that infect the attine fungal gardens. Thus, we propose that the selection of this biosynthetically prolific strain from the natural environment provides A. octospinosus with broad spectrum activity against Escovopsis and other microfungal weeds...|$|E
40|$|About 50 polyenic {{antifungal}} antibiotics {{produced by}} actinomycetes have been isolated and described. Among {{these are the}} most effective antimonilial agents so far known. These polyenes can be classified into four broad groups depending on the number of conjugated carbon-to-carbon double bonds that are present in their chromophores. Only some of the tetraenes (four conjugated double bonds), such as nystatin and pimaricin, and a few heptaenes (seven conjugated double bonds), such as amphotericin B, Trichomycin <b>candicidin</b> and hamycin, have found practical application in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by fungi. Nystatin and pimaricin show the least in vitro activity against fungi, while trichomycin and <b>candicidin</b> are the most active.

40|$|A {{large number}} of Streptomyces {{bacteria}} with antifungal activity isolated from samples collected in the Trondheim fjord (Norway) were found to produce polyene compounds. Investigation of polyene-containing extracts revealed {{that most of the}} isolates produced the same compound, which had an atomic mass and UV spectrum corresponding to those of <b>candicidin</b> D. The morphological diversity of these isolates prompted us to speculate about the involvement of a mobile genetic element in dissemination of the <b>candicidin</b> biosynthesis gene cluster (can). Eight candicidin-producing isolates were analyzed by performing a 16 S rRNA gene-based taxonomic analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, PCR, and Southern blot hybridization with can-specific probes. These analyses revealed that most of the isolates were related, although they were morphologically diverse, and that all of them contained can genes. The majority of the isolates studied contained large plasmids, and two can-specific probes hybridized to a 250 -kb plasmid in one isolate. Incubation of the latter isolate at a high temperature resulted in loss of the can genes and <b>candicidin</b> production, while mating of the “cured” strain with a plasmid-containing donor restored <b>candicidin</b> production. The latter result suggested that the 250 -kb plasmid contains the complete can gene cluster and could be responsible for conjugative transfer of this cluster to other streptomycetes...|$|E

40|$|A 205 kb DNA region from Streptomyces griseus IMRU 3570, {{including}} the <b>candicidin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster, was cloned and partially sequenced. Analysis of the sequenced DNA led to identification of genes encoding {{part of a}} modular polyketide synthase (PKS), genes for thioesterase, macrolactone ring modification, mycosamine biosynthesis and attachment to the macrolide ring, <b>candicidin</b> export and regulatory proteins.

Of particular interest {{is the presence of}} the CanP 1 loading domain (the first described as responsible for the activation of an aromatic starter unit) and the polypeptide CanP 3 (carrying modules for the formation of five out of seven conjugated double bonds). Disruption of the pabAB gene that encodes the starter unit of <b>candicidin</b> abolished its production [which was restored when exogenous p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) was supplied to the culture] and resulted in an enhanced production of another antifungal compound that is barely detected in the wild-type...|$|E

With amphotericin B a correlation was observed between the decrease in absorption caused by certain derivatives of fatty acids and the protective action of these derivatives against the activity of amphotericin B on yeast.

40|$|Leaf-cutting ants such as Acromyrmex octospinosus live in obligate {{symbiosis}} with fungi of {{the genus}} Leucoagaricus, which they grow with harvested leaf material. The symbiotic fungi, in turn, serve as a major food source for the ants. This mutualistic relation is disturbed by the specialized pathogenic fungus Escovopsis sp., which can overcome Leucoagaricus sp. and thus destroy the ant colony. Microbial symbionts of leaf-cutting ants have been suggested to protect the fungus garden against Escovopsis by producing antifungal compounds [Currie CR, Scott JA, Summerbell RC, Malloch D (1999) Fungus-growing ants use antibiotic-producing bacteria to control garden parasites. Nature 398 : 701 – 704. ]. To date, however, the chemical nature of these compounds has remained elusive. We characterized 19 leaf-cutting ant–associated microorganisms (5 Pseudonocardia, 1 Dermacoccus, and 13 Streptomyces) from 3 Acromyrmex species, A. octospinosus, A. echinatior, and A. volcanus, using 16 S-rDNA analysis. Because the strain Streptomyces sp. Ao 10 proved highly active against the pathogen Escovopsis, we identified the molecular basis of its antifungal activity. Using bioassay-guided fractionation, high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), and UV spectroscopy, and comparing the results with an authentic standard, we were able identify <b>candicidin</b> macrolides. <b>Candicidin</b> macrolides are highly active against Escovopsis but do not significantly affect {{the growth of the}} symbiotic fungus.

40|$|The {{isolation}} of microbial producers of bioactive natural products from environmental samples {{has historically been}} a great success and {{laid the foundation for}} the modern medical science we enjoy the fruits of today. To sustain and further improve the treatment of diseases, we rely upon the continued discovery and development of new bioactive compounds. The work presented in this thesis describes the screening of more than 4000 actinomycete isolates recovered from sediment and neuston layer samples collected in the Trondheimsfjord. The objective was to discover producers of new compounds with antifungal or cytotoxic activity. The primary screening approach based on assays with Candida strains uncovered a large number of isolates producing bioactive compounds, however, spectroscopic analyses of extracts from these isolates revealed that a high percentage of the isolates were potentially producing the same compound. LC-MS-TOF analysis of the extracts identified the compound in question as the polyene macrolide <b>candicidin.</b> A genetic analysis of eight isolates showed that they all contained the <b>candicidin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster and that the cluster was present on a large plasmid in one of the isolates. The plasmid’s ability for transfer to other Streptomyces strains was investigated, but interspecific transfer could not be detected. A “cured” strain unable to produce <b>candicidin</b> was obtained by incubation of the plasmid-containing isolate at a high temperature and reintroduction of the plasmid restored the <b>candicidin</b> production, thus indicating that the plasmid is transmissible by conjugation. It is possible that the plasmid may have been responsible for the dissemination of the <b>candicidin</b> biosynthetic gene cluster among actinomycetes in sediments and neuston layer of the Trondheimsfjord, although the results from this study were not conclusive. Candidates selected based on the primary screening against Candida strains were further evaluated in assays with different cancer cell lines. A compound displaying good cytotoxic activity was identified as the previously described macrolactam antibiotic BE- 14106 by LC-MS-TOF analysis and NMR spectroscopy. A genomic library was constructed for the BE- 14106 producer and screened with a molecular probe targeting polyketide synthase genes. The biosynthetic gene cluster was successfully identified and sequenced and the biosynthetic pathway leading to production of BE- 14106 was elucidated. The proposal for the biosynthetic pathway is supported by results from gene inactivation experiments, enzyme assays with heterologously expressed proteins and feeding studies with isotope labeled components. A second macrolactam, ML- 449, was identified in the primary screening against the Candida strains. LC-MS-TOF analysis indicated structural resemblance to BE- 14106. The complete structure of ML- 449 was obtained by NMR spectroscopy, showing that BE- 14106 and ML- 449 only differ in the length of the acyl side chain. The ML- 449 biosynthetic gene cluster was subsequently cloned, sequenced and compared to the BE- 14106 biosynthetic gene cluster. The two clusters were found to be remarkably similar, differing only in the genes encoding the polyketide synthases synthesizing the acyl side chain. Phylogenetic analyses pointed to common ancestry for the two clusters as well as an evolutionary relationship with other macrolactam biosynthetic gene clusters.             PhD i bioteknologiPhD in Biotechnolog...|$|E

40|$|The marine {{environment}} {{has so far}} been poorly utilized in the search for (producers of) novel antimicrobial compounds. Marine bioprospecting might therefore be a promising field of research for the pharmaceutical industry as an alternative to terrestrial sources and synthetic production of pharmaceuticals. In this project, over 4000 cultivable isolates have been isolated from different locations in the Trondheim fjord and along the coast of Trøndelag, Norway. Over 1000 of these bacteria were isolated from the sea surface microlayer, whereas the rest originated from sediment samples. The diversity of the isolates from the sea surface microlayer have been investigated by studying cultivable bacteria from two sampling locations as ‘model-samples’. Whole-cell based antimicrobial assays revealed surprisingly high numbers of isolates displaying antagonistic activity among the assayed streptomycetes. 16 S rDNA analyses indicated that several isolates seemed to be closely related, and studies on the PKS type I genes present in these samples revealed that recent horizontal gene transfer might have taken place. The results indicate that de-replication of isolates can not be performed based on 16 S rDNA sequences alone, and the identification of unique KS-sequences in some of these isolates further supports this statement. Two streptomycete isolates from the sea surface microlayer displayed activity against a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp. Analysis of the bacterial extracts indicated that this might be due to the production of a novel antibacterial compound. Plasmids {{play an important role in}} the horizontal gene transfer among bacterial species. The genes involved in the biosynthesis of the antifungal polyene macrolide <b>candicidin</b> were found to be present on a linear plasmid in one on the isolated strains.

40|$|Polyene {{macrolides}} are potent antifungal {{agents that}} are also active against parasites, enveloped viruses and prion diseases. They are medically important as antifungal antibiotics but their therapeutic use is limited by serious side effects. In recent {{years there has been}} considerable progress in genetic analysis and manipulation of the streptomycetes that produce nystatin, amphotericin B, <b>candicidin,</b> pimaricin and rimocidin/CE- 108 -related polyenes. This has led to engineered biosynthesis of several new polyenes that are not easily obtained as semisynthetic derivatives. This review summarises recent advances made since the subject was last reviewed in 2003. Polyene biosynthesis generally involves assembly and cyclisation of a polyketide chain, followed by oxidative modifications and glycosylation of the macrolactone ring. New derivatives have been obtained by engineering both early and late stages of polyene biosynthetic pathways. These compounds have allowed more detailed investigations of structure-activity relationships and some are likely to show improvements in therapeutic index. The biosynthetic approach is already yielding sufficient material for testing the toxicity and activity of new compounds, thus opening possibilities for discovery of leads for development of effective and safe antifungal and antiparasitic agents...|$|E
40|$|Streptomyces species {{produce an}} {{incredible}} array of high-value specialty chemicals and medicinal therapeutics. A single species typically harbors ~ 30 biosynthetic pathways, {{but only a}} mere handful of them are expressed in the laboratory, thus poor understanding of how natural products biosynthesis is regulated is a major bottleneck in drug discovery. Antimycins are a large family of anticancer compounds widely produced by Streptomyces species and their regulation is atypical {{compared to that of}} most other natural products. Here we demonstrate that antimycin production by Streptomyces albus S 4 is regulated by FscRI, a PAS-LuxR-family cluster-situated regulator of the polyene antifungal agent, <b>candicidin.</b> We report that heterologous production of antimycins by Streptomyces coelicolor is dependent on FscRI and show that FscRI activates transcription of key biosynthetic genes. We also demonstrate through ChIP sequencing that FscRI regulation is direct and we provide evidence to suggest that this regulation strategy is conserved and unique to short form antimycin gene clusters. Our study provides direct in vivo evidence for cross-regulation of disparate biosynthetic gene clusters specifying unrelated natural products and expands the paradigmatic understanding of the regulation of secondary metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Streptomyces albus J 1074 is a streptomycete strain {{widely used}} as a host for {{expression}} of secondary metabolite gene clusters. Bioinformatic analysis of the genome of this organism predicts the presence of 27 gene clusters for secondary metabolites. We have used three different strategies for the activation {{of some of these}} silent/cryptic gene clusters in S. albus J 1074 : two hybrid polyketide-non-ribosomal peptides (PK-NRP) (antimycin and 6 -epi-alteramides), a type I PK (<b>candicidin),</b> a non-ribosomal peptides (NRP) (indigoidine) and glycosylated compounds (paulomy-cins). By insertion of a strong and constitutive pro-moter in front of selected genes of two clusters, production of the blue pigment indigoidine and of two novel members of the polycyclic tetramate macrolactam family (6 -epi-alteramides A and B) was activated. Overexpression of positive regulatory genes from the same organism also activated the biosynthesis of 6 -epi-alteramides and heterologous expression of the regulatory gene pimM of the pimaricin cluster activated the simultaneous produc-tion of candicidins and antimycins, suggesting some kind of cross-regulation between both clusters. A cluster for glycosylated compounds (paulomycins) was also identified by comparison of the high-performance liquid chromatography profiles of the wild-type strain with that of a mutant in which two key enzymes of the cluster were simultaneously deleted...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} heptamycin (an {{antifungal}} heptaene antibiotic {{closely related to}} the ascosin-candicidin-trichomycin group) on the respiration of Cmdidu albicans was studied. Heptamycin inhibited the oxidation of pyruvate, lactate and trehalose to a considerable degree. The oxidation of glucose, acetate, acetaldehyde and ethanol was only slightly affected by heptamycin. Anaerobic glycolysis was significantly inhibited. No inhibition of cell-free preparations of trehalase (obtained from C. albicans) or pyruvic carboxylase (from C. albicans and Saccharmyces carhber-gensis) was observed; CO, output by cell-free preparations was not affected either. The uptake of pyruvate and trehalose by C. albicans cells is apparently due to an active and inducible mechanism; heptamycin inhibits oxidation of these sub-stances by blocking their penetration into the yeast cell. The oxidation of trehalose in induced organisms was not inhibited by heptamycin whereas that of pyruvate was. Heptamycin, <b>candicidin</b> B, ascosin, trichomycin and amphotericin B inhibited phosphate uptake by non-proliferating suspensions of C. albicans. The inhibition was observed a t fungistatic concentrations (0. 5 - 5,ug. /ml.) and without any preincubation with the antibiotic. Phosphate uptake by Debaryomyces nicotianae, Pichia farinosa, Cryptococcus albidus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae was similarly affected by heptamycin. Esterification of inorganic phosphate by cell-free extracts of C. albicans was not affected by heptamycin. It is suggested that the fungistatic effect of heptaene antibiotics upon sensitive yeasts is mainly due to the prevention of phosphate uptake...|$|E
40|$|The polyene {{macrolide}} group includes important antifungal drugs, to which resistance does not arise readily. Chemical and biological {{methods have been}} used in attempts to make polyene antibiotics with fewer toxic side effects. Genome sequencing of producer organisms is contributing to this endeavour, by providing access to new compounds and by enabling yield improvement for polyene analogues obtained by engineered biosynthesis. This recent work is also enhancing bioinformatic methods for deducing the structures of cryptic natural products from their biosynthetic enzymes. The stereostructure of <b>candicidin</b> D has recently been determined by NMR spectroscopy. Genes for the corresponding polyketide synthase have been uncovered in several different genomes. Analysis of this new information strengthens the view that protein sequence motifs can be used to predict double bond geometry in many polyketides. Chemical studies have shown that improved polyenes can be obtained by modifying the mycosamine sugar that is common to most of these compounds. Glycoengineered analogues might be produced by biosynthetic methods, but polyene glycosyltransferases show little tolerance for donors other than GDP-α-D-mycosamine. Genome sequencing has revealed extending glycosyltransferases that add a second sugar to the mycosamine of some polyenes. NppY of Pseudonocardia autotrophica uses UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-glucosamine as donor whereas PegA from Actinoplanes caeruleus uses GDP-α-D-mannose. These two enzymes show 51 % sequence identity and are also closely related to mycosaminyltransferases. These findings will assist attempts to construct glycosyltransferases that transfer alternative UDP- or (d) TDP-linked sugars to polyene macrolactones...|$|E
