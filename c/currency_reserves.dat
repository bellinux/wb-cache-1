5|$|Since its introduction, {{the euro}} {{has been the}} second most widely held {{international}} reserve currency after the U.S. dollar. The share of the euro as a reserve currency increased from 18% in 1999 to 27% in 2008. Over this period, the share held in U.S. dollar fell from 71% to 64% and that held in Yen fell from 6.4% to 3.3%. The euro inherited and built {{on the status of}} the Deutsche Mark as the second most important reserve currency. The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency in advanced economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies: according to the International Monetary Fund the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to $1.1trillion or €850 billion, with a share of 22% of all <b>currency</b> <b>reserves</b> in advanced economies, but a total of 31% of all <b>currency</b> <b>reserves</b> in emerging and developing economies.|$|E

500|$|The {{possibility}} of the euro becoming the first international <b>reserve</b> <b>currency</b> is now widely debated among economists. Former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave his opinion in September 2007 that it was [...] "absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as <b>reserve</b> <b>currency,</b> or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency". In contrast to Greenspan's 2007 assessment, the euro's increase in {{the share of the}} worldwide <b>currency</b> <b>reserve</b> basket has slowed considerably since 2007 and {{since the beginning of the}} worldwide credit crunch related recession and European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|R

There is anecdotal evidence that some Icelandic exporters had been operating an informal offshore {{foreign exchange}} market, trading pounds and euros for krónur outside {{the control of}} any regulator and starving the onshore market of foreign currency. Hence the Central Bank had to sell €124 million of <b>currency</b> <b>reserves</b> in November 2008 {{to make up the}} difference, compared with an estimated trade surplus of €13.9 million.|$|E
5|$|Both VAT and SAT were criticised in 1954 {{by heavy}} vehicle {{importers}} {{because the two}} companies had access to {{a large share of}} the limited foreign <b>currency</b> <b>reserves</b> for component supply. The importers' representatives said neither Sisu nor Vanaja were very domestic products and the vehicles the importers represented were actually more domestic because some assembly work was done in Finland. According to the Association of Vehicle Importers, the domestic vehicles cost between 30% and 80% more compared to imported ones. The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure. VAT and SAT expressed doubts about the viability of such production. In 1957, the government ended restrictions on the import of heavy vehicle chassis. Eventually, the prices of imported vehicles approached those of Sisu and Vanaja vehicles.|$|E

In August 1914, he participated in the first aerial dogfight of the war, when he {{exchanged}} gunfire with an Austro-Hungarian plane over western Serbia. In the winter of 1915, during the Serbian Army's retreat across Albania to the Greek island of Corfu, he evacuated General Petar Bojović from Scutari by plane, delivered mail by air and transported the Serbian Government's gold and hard <b>currency</b> <b>reserves</b> from Niš {{to keep them from}} falling into enemy hands. Following the occupation of Serbia by the Central Powers, Tomić went to France and flew over the Western Front, where he had one confirmed kill. He returned to the Balkans in late 1916, conducted combat missions over Bulgarian-occupied Macedonia and shot down one enemy plane. Tomić continued flying after the war and became head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force's pursuit squadron in Novi Sad. During World War II, he was captured by the Germans and detained as a prisoner of war. Tomić left Yugoslavia following the war and settled in the United States with his wife. He died in Chicago in 1962.|$|E
40|$|Summary: It is {{most likely}} that the current <b>reserve</b> <b>currencies</b> will retain their status in the near future, given the {{persistence}} {{in the composition of}} reserve holdings. However, since we do not have complete data on the switchovers in lead <b>reserve</b> <b>currencies,</b> a great deal of uncertainty attends any forecasts. Hence, it is possible that new <b>reserve</b> <b>currencies</b> might appear with greater rapidity than anticipated. Of the candidates for new <b>reserve</b> <b>currencies</b> among the major emerging economies, the renminbi (RMB) is the most plausible. However, even under optimistic assumptions regarding economic growth and financial development, RMB status as a major <b>reserve</b> <b>currency</b> is some time off. A role for regional <b>reserve</b> <b>currency</b> status in the near future is much more likely. The advent of a multi‐reserve currency world is unlikely to have negative consequences for global financial stability (and might be stability‐enhancing). However, achieving the prerequisites for <b>reserve</b> <b>currency</b> status will force sacrifices in terms of policy autonomy. In addition, <b>reserve</b> <b>currency</b> status might reduce international competitiveness for individual countries, as higher currency demand appreciates their currencies...|$|R

5|$|The Commercial Import Program {{was created}} in January 1955, {{immediately}} upon the transfer of France's remaining direct influence over the State of Vietnam to the chief of state, former Emperor Bảo Đại and his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem. The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and national polls never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US wanted to build a strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now be more expensive than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. The suppliers of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign <b>currency</b> <b>reserves</b> and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a deregulated market, leading to a series of significant shortages and surpluses of various goods due to their inexperience in judging market forces and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 applications for import licenses were received, many from speculators. In the early years of the initiative, a proportion of the US funding for the CIP came through the proceeds of the sale of surplus American agricultural products to France.|$|E

25|$|The oil sales losses Iran is {{experiencing}} {{are likely to}} produce over $50 billion in hard currency revenue losses in a one-year period at current oil prices. The IMF estimated Iran’s hard <b>currency</b> <b>reserves</b> to be $106 billion as {{of the end of}} 2011, and some economists say that figure may have fallen to about $80 billion as of November 2012. Analysts at one outside group, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, believe Iran’s hard <b>currency</b> <b>reserves</b> might be exhausted entirely by July 2014 at current rates of depletion. Compounding the loss of oil sales by volume is that many of its oil transactions reportedly are now conducted on a barter basis—or in exchange for gold, which is hard currency but harder to use than cash is. In addition, the 6 February 2013, imposition of sanctions on Iran’s ability to repatriate hard currency could cause the depletion rate to increase.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the official}} use of international <b>currencies</b> as <b>reserve</b> <b>currency</b> (store of value) and anchor currency (unit of account). Examining the {{role as a}} <b>reserve</b> <b>currency</b> we note that the US dollar is the main <b>reserve</b> <b>currency</b> even if it recorded a decline given the decrease {{of the value of}} the US dollar reserve holdings and the gradual diversification of the currencies used. Since 2010, the euro's share decreased continuously may be due to the Eurozone crisis and the euro's depreciation against the US dollar. Then we show that the US dollar dominates as an anchor currency, though it was temporary abandoned during crisis time, having more than a regional dimension. At the same time, the use of the euro in exchange rate arrangements appears mainly in the regions that have close links with the euro area. Over the last few years, we have witnessed a gentle orientation towards a multimonetary world, especially regarding the use of the international <b>currencies</b> as <b>reserve</b> <b>currency</b> given the diversification of the currencies in which central banks understand to hold international reserves and the increasing share of the nontraditional currencies in total foreign exchange reserves...|$|R
