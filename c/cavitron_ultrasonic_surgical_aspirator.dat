40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirator</b> assisted disk fenestration technique in dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cadaveric and prospective clinical study. ANIMALS: Fresh Beagle cadavers (n= 5) and 10 chondrodystrophic dogs with thoracolumbar disk extrusion. METHODS: Cadaveric study: Intervertebral disks T 12 -L 2 were fenestrated with the CUSA Excel in 5 Beagle cadavers, and fenestration efficacy assessed by morphologic {{examination of the}} completeness of fenestration and size of annulotomy. Clinical study: the affected intervertebral disk was fenestrated in 10 chondrodystrophic dogs treated by hemilaminectomy for thoracolumbar disk disease. Efficacy of fenestration was evaluated. RESULTS: Mean time necessary to perform CUSA assisted fenestration was 8 minutes (range, 5 - 10 minutes) for each disk in cadavers and patients. In cadaver spines, removal of the nucleus pulposus was complete in 11 / 15 disks. In 4 disks, remnants of nucleus pulposus material were observed on the contralateral side. Nuclear material was normal in 9 / 15 disks and showed evidence of chondroid degeneration on histopathologic examination in the 6 disks. Median annulotomy size was 3 mm.

40|$|IntroductionSurgical endarterectomy is the {{preferred}} method for treating occlusive disease of the common femoral artery (CFA). However, endarterectomy is not always straightforward in cases with heavily calcified plaque. To overcome this limitation, a new method for decalcification, which utilizes a <b>Cavitron</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirator</b> (CUSA) has been developed. ReportThe method involves full exposure of the calcified lesion. Following an arteriotomy, protruding calcification is removed using the CUSA, taking care to avoid vessel perforation. Preservation of the medial calcified layer {{can be accomplished by}} the accurate control provided by the device, which enables smooth termination in the distal area of the normal wall and does not require a tacking suture. A total of 12 patients underwent decalcification of 13 common femoral artery (CFA) lesions using CUSA with vein patch angioplasty. Concomitant profundaplasty was performed in five cases. The only intra-operative complication was perforation of the arterial wall in one patient, while another had a wound infection that required reintervention.

40|$|Background. Surgical {{resection}} is {{the most}} effective therapy for liver cancer. Intraoperative blood loss during liver resection remains a major concern due to association with higher postoperative complications. The InLine radiofrequency ablation device (ILRFA) has achieved promising results in liver surgery with minimal blood loss and no increase of postoperative complications. In this multicentre controlled study, 108 patients undergoing liver resection were investigated. Patients and methods. A total of 108 patients underwent liver resections in 4 medical centres; the prospective sequential cohort study consisted of 54 ILRFA and 54 <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirator</b> transections as the control group. Results. The type of liver resection performed was very similar in both groups. The median number of RFA deployments was 3 (range 1 – 12) with a median coagulation time of 9 (range 3 – 36) min. Median blood loss was 165 ± 20 ml (range 5 – 675) in the ILRFA and 654 ± 83 ml (range 80 – 3600) in the control group (p< 0. 001). The median transection time was 27 (2 – 219) min in the ILRFA group and 35 (5 – 62) min in controls. Conclusions. Our study indicates that ILRFA device for liver transection is effective in reducing blood loss and is safe. Precoagulation before parenchymal transection appears to be a valid concept in liver surgery. The avoidance of vascular inflow occlusion during parenchymal transection could also be of value...|$|R

This review assesses {{the benefits and}} risks associated with the various techniques. MethodsRandomized clinical trials were identified from the Cochrane Library Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded and reference lists. Odds ratio (ORs), mean difference (MDs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals based on intention-to-treat analysis or available-case analysis. ResultsWe identified seven trials including a total of 556 patients. Blood transfusion requirements were lower with the clamp–crush technique than with the CUSA or hydrojet. The clamp–crush technique was quicker than the CUSA, hydrojet or RFDS. Infective complications and transection blood loss were greater with the RFDS than with the clamp–crush method.

40|$|Background: Liver {{resection}} {{remains the}} gold standard for the treatment of both primary and metastatic liver tumors. The goal of liver resection is to remove all macroscopic disease with negative resection margins and leave sufficient functioning liver. In patients with colorectal liver metastases several factors have found to be independent predictors of survival, such as intraoperative blood transfusion requirement, nodal status of the primary tumor, presence of multiple satellite nodules, and cancer involved surgical resection margin. In some studies a subcentimeter resection margin is linked to a greater liver recurrence even though it should not preclude resection, and {{it has been shown that}} repeat hepatectomy for recurrent colorectal metastases can prolong survival in selected patients and has low operative risk. Moreover, good survival rates have been described in some groups of patients with less than 1 cm clearance. Several investigations have demonstrated that the risk of recurrence increases significantly with the size of liver metastases, especially when the size is > 5 cm. This risk is attributed to the increased invasiveness of larger masses, as shown by a higher incidence of intrahepatic metastasis and portal venous invasion for large metastases. The aim of the study was to evaluate the recurrence-free survival in patients with positive margins after hepatic resection of liver metastases (LM) from colorectal cancer, followed by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of surgical margins. Patients and Methods: Data regarding a group of six patients (4 men and 2 women, aged 67. 7 ± 18. 2 years), with positive margins at final pathology of resected LM were retrospectively analyzed. Surgery included 2 wedge resections, 2 segmentectomies and 2 pluri-segmentectomies. All patients were treated with RFA of surgical margins, and all of them received adjuvant chemotherapy. Final pathology found positive margins in all patients. Results: All patients are alive at the follow-up of 24. 2 ± 2. 6 months. None of them had liver recurrence, but a distant recurrence was found in two (lung and lymph nodes) after 11 and 6 months, respectively. Thus, local recurrence-free survival was 24. 2 ± 2. 6 months, while systemic recurrence-free survival was 18 ± 16. 4 months. Main biochemical findings on day 0, 1, and 5 were: (1) haemoglobin 12, 7 ± 0. 9, 10. 1 ± 0. 9, 10 ± 0. 6 g/dL, (2) alanine-aminotransferase 33. 3 ± 30. 8, 212 ± 125. 4, 51. 7 ± 36. 2 U/L, (3) albumin 4 ± 0. 3, 2. 8 ± 0. 4, 3. 0 ± 0. 2 g/dL, (4) international normalized ratio (INR) 1. 2 ± 0. 1, 1. 3 ± 0. 1, 1. 1 ± 0. 1. Conclusions: The role of surgical margin after liver resection for LM is controversial. It has been suggested that margin status is an independent predictor of long-term outcome after hepatic resection for LM. Thus, in patients undergoing hepatic resection for LM a > 1 cm margin should be attempted, whenever possible. The use of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirator</b> achieves an additional resection margin of approximately 5 mm, while with RFA more liver parenchyma could be preserved, adding approximately 10 mm of clear margin. Interestingly, RFA treatment seems to influence only the local recurrence. These preliminary data suggest that the technique is safe, and may be considered after liver resection for LM...|$|R

The authors present their initial experience of a heterogenous spectrum of robotic hepatobiliary cases and the first reported case series from India. Methods: Retrospective review of hepatobiliary cases done robotically from February 2015 to January 2016 was done. Results: The series has ten patients; with median age of 45 years (range 15 – 72). Etiologies were choledochal cyst type IVa, benign lower end common bile duct stricture (biliary reconstruction group); incidental gallbladder carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, polycystic liver disease, hemangioma, liver metastases, hydatid cyst (resection group). Median operative duration was 510  min; one patient needed intra-operative blood transfusion {{and there were no}} conversions to open surgery. One patient developed bile leak which was managed by biliary stenting and another thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura during post-operative period. Median length of hospital stay was 6  days with average cost of robotic surgery being $ 1700 USD more for major hepatectomy and $ 900 USD more for biliary reconstruction compared to open procedure. Conclusion: This initial series adds to existing data on the feasibility of robotic hepatobiliary cases with inherent advantages of minimal invasive surgery, however with limitation of availability and use of devices like <b>cavitron</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirator</b> (CUSA) and higher operative cost...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{any change}} in the operative and survival outcomes in patients undergoing a right hepatectomy after adoption of the no-clamp technique using a radiofrequency dissecting sealer (TissueLink™) in liver resection. MethodsIn all, 58 consecutive patients who underwent a right hepatectomy from July 2003 to December 2007 (Group 1) were compared with 66 consecutive patients who underwent a right hepatectomy from January 1999 to June 2003 (Group 2). In group 1, a liver transection was performed with a <b>cavitron</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirator</b> (CUSA) and TissueLink™ without hilar clamping whereas in group 2, a liver transection was performed with CUSA and diathermy with routine continuous hilar clamping. ResultsFor the operative outcomes, there was significantly less blood loss (median 450 vs. 900 ml, P < 0. 001) in group 1. The complication rate was also significantly lower in group 1 (22. 4 % vs. 47. 0 %, P= 0. 004). In subgroup analysis for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the overall survival rate was significantly better in group 1; 1 -, 3 - and 5 -year survival rates were 78 %, 72 % and 57 % in group 1 vs. 72 %, 44 % and 39 % in group 2, respectively (P= 0. 048). ConclusionsWhen compared with the retrospective cohort, a right hepatectomy utilizing TissueLink™ without hilar clamping was feasible with potential benefits in surgical outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Since Guidetti and Slooff's masterbooks (1964), {{numerous}} {{papers have}} {{been devoted to}} intramedullary spinal cord tumors (IMT) and their treatment, {{most of them were}} focused on ependymomas and astrocytomas. Informed opinion was that these tumors were difficult to cure and that biopsy plus radiotherapy was the treatment of choice. Thanks to microsurgery and bipolar coagulation surgeons grew bolder and more efficient as illustrated by the contributions from Hurth or Resche on hemangioblastomas, Fischer on ependymomas, Epstein on childhood astrocytomas and Guidetti, Malis, Stein on IMT in general. Meanwhile, in the eighties, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and <b>Cavitron</b> <b>Ultrasonic</b> <b>Surgical</b> <b>Aspirator</b> (CUSA) drastically modified diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of IMTs, as may be judged by the significant {{increase in the number of}} publications on this topic in current medical literature. However, no updated work of synthesis is currently available. This prompted us to publish our common experience based on 171 patients and 200 surgical procedures. Thanks to the collaboration of many colleagues of the "Société de Neurochirurgie de Langue Française" (SNCLF) who completed a questionnaire sent to them, we are now in the position to give an epidemiological estimation based on 1117 cases. This work is divided in three main parts. The first part deals with considerations common to all IMTs, the second with particular aspects specific of each tumoral type, the third with the results and concluding recommendations.

40|$|<b>Surgical</b> <b>aspirators</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used neurosurgical tools. Effective training on a neurosurgery simulator requires a visually and haptically realistic rendering of surgical aspiration. However, there is little published data on mechanical interaction between soft biological tissues and <b>surgical</b> <b>aspirators.</b> In this study an experimental setup for measuring tissue response is described and results on calf brain and a range of phantom materials are presented. Local graphical and haptic models are proposed. They are simple enough for real-time application, and closely match the observed tissue response. Tissue resection (cutting) with suction is simulated using a volume sculpting approach. A simulation of suction is presented as a demonstration of the effectiveness of the approach.

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} early {{postoperative}} results betweenRadiofrequency (RF) -assisted and <b>Cavitron</b> <b>Ultrasonic</b> SurgicalAspirator (CUSA) liver resection for HCC {{in patients with}} cirrhosis. METHODS: 18 cirrhotic patients who underwent RF-assisted liverresection for HCC were compared with 18 cirrhotic patients whounderwent CUSA liver resection. The two groups were well matchedfor age, gender, tumor size, and severity of cirrhosis. (Child-Pugh A). RESULTS: The mean Intraoperative blood loss (RF, 58 ± 61 mL; vsCUSA, 197 ± 75 mL; pr, p= 0. 001) was statistically less for the RFassistedgroup, The mean hospital stay is shorter in the RF-assistedgroup (RF-assisted, 7 ± 2 days; vs CUSA, 10 ± 3 days; pr, p= 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: RF-assisted liver resection for HCC in properlyselected cirrhotic group showed less intraoperative blood loss andshorter hospital stay than the CUSA group...|$|R
40|$|Background. Intraparenchymal endometriosis {{of liver}} is rare. It may present as liver tumour and the {{diagnosis}} is not usually established till after surgery. Case Outline. A 48 -year-old postmenopausal woman presented with right upper quadrant pain and a cystic liver mass. Liver function tests and tumour markers (&#x 03 B 1;FP, CEA, CA 19 - 9, and CA 125) were normal. Radiological imaging (USS, CT and MRI) suggested a thick walled cystic mass involving segments IV and VIII with complex intracystic septations. Frozen section at operation suggested a benign cystadenoma. The cyst was enucleated using a CUSA (<b>Cavitron</b> <b>ultrasonic</b> aspirator). The final histology confirmed endometriosis. Discussion. Eleven cases of hepatic endometrioma have been reported and only four in postmenopausal women. Preoperative diagnosis poses a challenge and so far none of the cases have been diagnosed preoperatively. Surgery remains the treatment of choice. Accurate diagnosis at time of operation may avoid extensive liver surgery and its associated morbidity...|$|R
