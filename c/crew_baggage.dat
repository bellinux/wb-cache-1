50|$|The current {{terminal}} {{serves as}} baggage claim, check-in, ticketing, TSA checkpoint and gates.

One airline representative manages check-in, ticketing and works as the gate agent. One is a TSA Senior Agent. The others are ground <b>crew</b> and <b>baggage</b> services.

40|$|Design {{data are}} {{presented}} {{for a class}} of high-performance single-engine business airplanes. The design objectives include a cruise speed of 300 knots, a cruise altitude of 10, 700 m (35, 000 ft), a cruise payload of six passengers (including <b>crew</b> and <b>baggage),</b> and a no-reserves cruise range of 1300 n. mi. Two unconventional aerodynamic technologies were evaluated: the individual and combined effects of cruise-matched wing loading and of a natural laminar flow airfoil were analyzed. The trade-off data presented illustrate the ranges of wing geometries, propulsion requirements, airplane weights, and aerodynamic characteristics which are necessary to meet the design objectives. Very large design and performance improvements resulted from use of the aerodynamic technologies evaluated. It is shown that the potential exists for achieving more than 200 -percent greater fuel efficiency than is achieved by current airplanes capable of similar cruise speeds, payloads, and ranges...|$|R
5000|$|It {{consisted}} of single class seating with no catering, interlining baggage, valet parking or frequent flyer points. After a month {{back in the}} air, the Golden Wing Club Lounges re-opened, however like the scaled-back flying operation, provided no refreshments or other amenities apart from coffee and water. Ansett was essentially in [...] "lock down" [...] mode, while the administrators tried to source buyers in a very challenging market. Ansett Mark II traded only as [...] "Ansett" [...] in a different font to separate it from the former operation. It traded from Ansett terminals, with Ansett ground staff, <b>crew</b> and <b>baggage</b> handlers {{working around the clock}} to make it a success with limited resources. Designated gates at each of Ansett's terminals were used for the operation, while aircraft not being utilised were moved away to more distant gates, with the disused concourses being sealed off.|$|R
2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the coroners court the Chief Inspector of Accidents opened an enquiry on 24 February. Evidence was taken from the surviving passengers and <b>crew</b> and <b>baggage</b> loaders. The co-pilot explained that the aircraft had just been delivered from the United States to Heathrow Airport following the purchase by Spencer. It had been ferried to Croydon the day before the accident and the long-range fuel tanks had been removed and the seats fitted. Preparing the aircraft had taken all day and night and Spencer was said to have had only two hours sleep. In the morning the starboard engine had a lack of pressure but the co-pilot and the radio operator said before the flight that it was OK. Another witness gave evidence that the wings were covered in snow and he had not seen any attempt to defrost the aircraft. A statement given by an inspector of police from Northern Rhodesia attested to the fact that Spencer did not smoke or drink and had many hours flying experience since the early 1930s. Following the statement about Spencer's lack of sleep the counsel representing the next-of-kin of Captain Spencer made a formal protest that they {{had not been able to}} question the statement. The inquiry was closed on 28 February following technical evidence and a statement from an aircraft engineer who had witnessed that the starboard engine had been in [...] "a bad state" [...] and was popping and spluttering before the aircraft had taken off.|$|R
