CFST columns offer an effcient and economical alternative to conventional reinforced concrete bridge columns, in that CFST columns can offer larger strength and stiffness and facilitate rapid construction. The first phase of this research project uses numerical and experimental methods to develop design procedures for various CFST column-to-cap beam connections. Three connections were studied, namely: (1) an embedded ange connection in which the CFST {{is embedded in the}} <b>cap</b> <b>beam,</b> (2) a welded dowel connection in which a series of headed dowels is welded inside the tube and embedded into the <b>cap</b> <b>beam</b> (both fully bonded and partially deboned conditions were studied), and (3) a dowel connection in which an independent cage of headed dowels and transverse reinforcing is developed into the CFST and embedded into the <b>cap</b> <b>beam.</b> All specimens were constructed using precast cap-beam components to demonstrate the feasibility of using these connections for accelerated bridge construction (ABC). The experimental program included specimens that simulated either the transverse or longitudinal direction of the bridge. Results showed that the three connection types provide excellent ductility under reversed-cyclic loading while all super-structure elements remained essentially elastic. The document provides design expressions, design examples and proposed codified language to facilitate immediate implementation of the research results into practice. In the second phase, performance based earthquake engineering (PBEE) tools were used to evaluate and compare the response of a reinforced concrete (RC) bridge with a CFST bridge designed using the design expressions developed in phase 1. The PBEE tool set included fragility functions that express the likelihood of damage and reparability, nonlinear analysis methods that capture the full cyclic response of the structural system, and incremental dynamic analyses (IDAs) to evaluate collapse potential. The analysis process was as follows: (1) the selected bridge was designed using RC and CFST components, with the objective of having the same strength and stiffness, (2) the structures were subjected to a suite of ground motions scaled to represent servicability (10 % probability of exceedance in 50 years), design (7 % probability of exceedance in 75 years), and maximum considered (2 % probability of exceedance in 50 years) seismic hazard levels, (3) fragility curves were used to compare the performance of the bridge including damage state as well as maximum and residual drift, and (4) IDAs were conducted to compare the collapse probability.

40|$|Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) {{utilizing}} precast components {{continues to}} be used as an effective tool for bridge construction due to time and cost saving techniques as well as the reduction of environmental impacts. However, in seismic regions, the use of precast members and ABC methods are limited due to concerns about poor performance of connections primarily between <b>cap</b> <b>beam</b> and girders. With sponsorship from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), two alternative connections between precast bulb tee girders and bridge cap were designed utilizing extended girder prestressed strands. The connections were designed to resist positive moments at the girder to cap connection. Positive moments occur at the connection when seismic forces cause upward deflection of the precast girders resulting in tension forces along the bottom of the girder to cap connection. The tension forces cause damage to the connection and can also unseat or disconnect the girders from the <b>cap</b> <b>beam</b> resulting in span collapse. The two connections were designed to minimized connection damage and prevent unseating of the girders. In one connection the extended strands were curved and relied on bond strength for anchorage along the 60 in. embedment length. The other connection consisted of spliced strands with anchor plates and chucks which relied on the transfer of forces through strand splices. Both connections also included three grouted dowel bars placed through the girder web. The connections were designed to provide adequate seismic moment resistance up to a combined load of gravity, horizontal ground acceleration corresponding to the column overstrength moment, as well as shear and moment values up to 0. 5 g vertical acceleration. A 40 % scale test unit was constructed in the Iowa State University structures laboratory and the two connections were tested. An analytical model was formulated to analytically quantify the behavior of each connection. The results of the tests showed that both connections had adequate capacity to resist horizontal and vertical ground acceleration forces as specified in current Caltrans seismic design criteria. Adjustments were made to the analytical model based on results of the test to improve the accuracy of the model. The overall results of the test demonstrate that ABC methods can be safely implemented in high seismic regions and be relied upon for dependable performance...|$|E

Different methods are investigated for predicting the capacity of the flange. The first assumes a uniform stress distribution resulting in bending of the flange.

The earth pressures {{were found to be}} influenced by the concrete expansion during hydration which caused transverse bending of the columns after the <b>capping</b> <b>beam</b> pour, as well as longitudinal backward rotations and bending of the abutments after the deck slab pours. High residual lateral earth pressures were exerted against the rear of the <b>capping</b> <b>beams</b> due to heavy compaction of the backfill at this level, thus causing the abutment to rotate forwards and become effectively propped by the deck slab.

Drilled shafts have been used for the stabilization of slopes for many decades. Micropiling is a relatively new approach in slope stabilization applications that has been adopted by many agencies and used in many problematic sites across the globe. However, limited knowledge regarding load transfer for piles within moving soil may cause design of the piles to be more conservative than is actually needed. The objective of this work is to provide guidance on the effects of pile batter and spacing so designers can reasonably account for these effects when predicting response of piles from lateral loading within moving soils. Load transfer to piles within moving soil masses was analyzed using soil-structure interaction methods. Based on measured soil movements and sliding surface locations, p-y analyses were performed to backcalculate "best fit" p- and y-multipliers that would lead to prediction of the measured bending moments in the micropiles and drilled shafts. The back-calculated p-y parameters were compared with values from literature and with one another to develop recommendations for predicting lateral resistance in deep foundations for slope stabilization applications. As a result of this study, a method was established to obtain p- and y-multipliers for any combination of spacing and batter angle for micropiles with a <b>capping</b> <b>beam.</b> Results of analysis indicate that spacing ratio and batter angle are important factors that influence the resistance. Data suggest that closer spacing increases the resistance, but batter angle was observed to have the greatest effect on resistance.

40|$|Future-proof {{design of}} quay walls is an {{interesting}} issue in civil Engineering, because of the dynamic environment in which quay walls are operating. Designers are confronted with time-changing requirements such as larger retaining heights and heavier loads. However, a technical and financial analysis has revealed that the design of new quay structures can, under certain conditions, be made future-proof by standardization. By standardizing the design, this may achieve {{a certain degree of}} flexibility. This means that a quay wall can be converted for multiple types of vessels or multiple types of cargo and therefore becomes future-proof. Various standard principle solutions are applicable. However, {{it should be noted that}} the exact dimensions of quay wall components, for instance the substructure (the front wall) and the superstructure (the <b>capping</b> <b>beam</b> or relieving platform), can in principle not be standardized. The dimensions depend namely on major factors such as local geotechnical conditions, surcharges, retaining height and the presence of a relieving platform. Nevertheless, standardization is possible in two ways. Firstly, by driving the front wall to a deeper layer than it is necessary in the first instance and dredging the front side of the quay wall at a later stage. This can be done by constructing all quay walls at equal depth, by area. This is a decision based on the local depth of the navigation channels and the expected business activity in the different areas. Secondly, by making a strategic choice for a particular quay component or a particular port area. Both ways lead to higher initial investment costs but results in a quay wall which is significantly more future-proof. From a technical and financial assessment it can be concluded that when heavy loads and large retaining heights are involved, a combined steel quay wall with a concrete relieving platform (often used by deep-seagoing vessels) is suitable and for inland barges an anchored combined wall should be applied. In case of a relieving platform, the floor should be located at NAP- 2 m with a length of 15 m. Quay walls used by inland barges should consist of a <b>capping</b> <b>beam</b> and a combined wall.

40|$|There is a {{great need}} for {{research}} on suitable connections between precast concrete elements which {{will be able to}} withstand significant stresses and deformations in earthquakes. The splice sleeve connection is being considered for connecting such elements in Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC). There is limited data for use of this connection in bridges located in moderate to high seismic regions. This proposal aims to extend the current pool fund study project. There {{is a great}} {{need to be able to}} retrofit bridge piers that will use the spliced sleeve connections. Structural Managers at UDOT after a recent scanning tour conducted by the FHWA have recommended that such a study be conducted. The project will be carried out by performing cyclic tests to verify the capacity of the retrofitted splice sleeve connection for precast concrete elements such as columns connected to footings or bent cap beams. Research Objectives: The objectives of this proposal are: (1) to perform quasi-static cyclic tests of a retrofitted damaged precast concrete column to footing splice sleeved connection, and a retrofitted damaged precast concrete column to bent <b>cap</b> <b>beam</b> connection using a mechanical sleeves; the retrofits will be accomplished by using Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) jackets; and (2) to evaluate to what extend the retrofitted sleeve connections behave in a manner consistent with the earthquake resisting elements that would be expected with traditional construction methods, a...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{project is the}} second part of a research program carried out by Itagawa (2005) who studied the seismic response of a half-scale model of an existing Montreal bridge built in the 1960 's. This project studies the seismic behaviour of the retrofit carried out on the frame structure studied {{in the first part of}} the research program. The retrofit was made following the requirements of the current Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code (CHBDC). The philosophy of the CHBDC is to provide flexural yielding in the ductile elements so that brittle failure modes such as shear are prevented. This capacity-design approach resulted in a ductile response and significant energy dissipation of the retrofitted structure. The retrofit was designed in accordance with the CHBDC provisions. The <b>cap</b> <b>beam</b> and the beam-column joint regions were strengthened with a reinforced concrete sleeve containing additional transverse and longitudinal bars so that plastic hinging would form in the columns. This retrofit represents minimum intervention to improve the response of the frame. The retrofit frame was then subjected to both gravity loads and reversed cyclic loading to simulate seismic loading on the structure. The predictions of the response of the retrofitted frame provided reasonable estimates of first yielding in the column and the general yielding of the frame. Although the columns would not meet the requirements for ductile columns, they had sufficient shear strength and did exhibit a displacement ductility of about 2. 3...|$|E

After the war, the Schiedam municipality bought the mill with the intention to restore it to grind again. The first phase of restoration began in 1962 where they restored the sail-cross, <b>cap,</b> tie <b>beams,</b> railing and capstan wheel. Roughly ten years later, the windmill was functioning again.|$|R
40|$|Although {{structural}} monitoring {{has been}} recognized as a powerful information tool, bridge managers often {{make decisions based on}} their experience or on common sense, somehow regardless of the action suggested by instrumental damage detection algorithms. In fact, managers weight differently the outcomes of the detection based on his/her príor perception {{of the state of the}} structure and decide keeping in mind the possible effects of the action he/she can undertake. In this paper we propose a rational framework to include the impact of the mentioned issues on decision making. The methodology is applied to the Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge, a new 1206 meter long cable-stayed structure across the Mississippi River, instrumented with an 84 -channel seismic instrumentation system. Using a finite element model, we estimate the probability distributions of the response of the bridge for a possible damage scenarío involving formation of plastic hinges at the intersection of tower columns and <b>cap</b> <b>beams.</b> The example shows how it is possible to estimate the economic benefit of a monitoring system for any event which requires a damage assessment...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{the seismic}} {{response}} {{of an existing}} bridge bent built in the 1960 's in the Montreal area is studied {{in order to determine}} its seismic deficiencies. Bridges built in the 1960 's were designed with outdated codes which had inadequate seismic design detailing provisions and therefore, are expected to behave poorly during an earthquake. The existing bridge bent examined has three major design deficiencies such as large spacing of ties in the column, total lack of shear reinforcement in the beam, and lack of shear reinforcement in the beam-column joint. A one-half scale model of the existing bridge bent was designed and constructed in the laboratory. This model was tested under reversed cyclic loading to determine the maximum applied load and failure mechanisms. The experimental results of the specimen are then compared to the response predictions. Both the experimental and predicted results revealed that the bridge bent is vulnerable to shear failure in the <b>cap</b> <b>beams</b> and hence, has inadequate performance. Research should be continued on the damaged specimen to determine the repair and retrofit techniques...|$|R
