In this context, this position paper proposes the deployment of universal Network Cost Services in the FI scene, explicitly providing the “network cost ” between two or more endpoints for a specific service and thus assisting the optimization of current and emerging communication paradigms, such as peer-to-peer communication, distributed caching, information-centric networking and in-network cloud services.

40|$|In an {{increasingly}} competitive business environment characterized by more globalization, deregulation and technological advances, {{companies have been}} looking for ways of differentiating their products and services and also rethinking their business model through leaner operations and reduced costs. In this context, a new practice that has recently gained a lot of attention is the offshore outsourcing of information technology (IT) activities and services. It has become {{an increasingly}} attractive proposition to companies and organizations in industrialized countries. The most often cited benefit of such a practice is its cost-effectiveness; i. e., the ability of having business tasks or processes performed in an offshore country (most often in India) at an equal quality but significantly reduced cost than doing them at home. This paper presents the benefits and concerns in IT offshore outsourcing and discusses the sustainability of the comparative advantage that India has as the leading offshoring destination in the world. It argues that the currently low wages of skilled IT staff in India may be eroding over time and companies will be shifting their attention to other value-adding benefits as opposed to looking in offshoring countries for just lower <b>cost</b> <b>provision</b> of IT tasks and services...|$|E

In single-hub rings, we investigate the minimum <b>cost</b> <b>provisioning</b> of uniform all-to-all traffic in two cases: where network coding is used to linearly combine data, and where it is not used and data is transmitted without coding.

These reflections were made {{in order to address}} the question ‘What is the aim of the <b>cost</b> recovery <b>provision</b> in the WFD and what obscurities arise in its interpretation that may hinder its effectiveness to attainment of these aims?’ In order to address the main question an examination was made whether the current <b>cost</b> recovery <b>provision</b> in Article 9 WFD has been positioned (and interpreted) in a manner that allows its application to reach full effect. That means whether it is positioned in such manner to contribute to the (environmental) objectives of sustainable, balanced and equitable water use of the WFD. In this respect a teleological approach in the examination was used in order to reflect upon the potential effectiveness of the <b>cost</b> recovery <b>provision</b> in relation to the normative goals to be reached. In this approach, first the normative context of the <b>cost</b> recovery <b>provision</b> was examined. This examination has been based on, firstly, a review of the position the <b>cost</b> recovery <b>provision,</b> as economic instrument, has been given in the WFD, related to the normative environmental goals. Secondly, the legislative history of the <b>cost</b> recovery <b>provision</b> was examined to determine what constitutes the <b>cost</b> recovery <b>provision.</b> In this respect also a legal theoretical approach has been used to determine what kind of character the <b>cost</b> recovery <b>provision</b> entails, the main character of a principle or rule. This approach was taken because the preliminary determination or assessment of a provision having the character of a principle or rule is frequently ignored, but in my view relevant, as the legal scope of provisions with the character of a principle or rule differ and will or should influence the performance of the provision within its normative context. The examination of the most important elements of the <b>cost</b> recovery <b>provision</b> furthermore has shown that many obscurities exist and vague, not sufficiently defined terminology is used. In this book arguments are provided to address cost recovery in a different manner than the European Court of Justice seems to have done. A manner that may enhance the effectiveness of the instrument of cost recovery to contribute to reaching sustainable and equitable water use. The findings in this book provide further insight on how to position cost recovery in European (and Dutch) legislation in order to enhance its potential effectiveness...|$|R

How do people with severe and persistent mental illness understand the potential role of physiotherapy in their healthcare, and what factors do they perceive as influencing access to physiotherapy services? Design: Qualitative study. Participants: Twenty-four {{mental health professionals}} and 35 people with severe and persistent mental illness. Methods: Interview schedules were developed to explore participants’ understanding of physiotherapy, as well as barriers and enablers to service access. Focus groups and interviews were conducted for each group of participants. Transcripts were analysed using an inductive approach to derive key themes. Results: Both the mental health professionals and the people with severe and persistent mental illness expressed a limited understanding of the role and relevance of physiotherapy for physical health in mental healthcare. Common barriers to service access were cost, transport and lack of motivation. Likewise, enablers of reduced <b>cost,</b> <b>provision</b> of transport and education about physiotherapy to improve their understanding were identified. The health system structure and perceived lack of mental health knowledge by physiotherapists influenced referrals from mental health professionals. Consequently, education in mental health for physiotherapists and integration of the service within mental health were identified as potential enablers to physiotherapy access. Conclusion: Limited understanding about physiotherapy and its relevance to physical health in mental healthcare among mental health professionals and people with severe and persistent mental illness was found to be a key factor influencing service access. Limited physiotherapy presence and advocacy within mental health were also highlighted. There is a need for greater understanding about physiotherapy among stakeholders, and for physiotherapists to be well equipped with skills and knowledge in mental health to facilitate greater involvement.

40|$|Thesis (MAcc (Accountancy)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The {{potential}} buyer {{of a business}} evaluates the attractiveness of the transaction by considering the financial status of the business being sold. In determining the financial status of a business {{it is more important}} to determine the nature of the assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet rather than the mere existence thereof. Included in the liabilities are accounting provisions recorded in terms of the Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP) to reflect a fair representation of the financial status. Although these provisions are made for accounting purposes, they cannot necessarily be deducted under the terms of the Income Tax Act, no 58 of 1962. The tax deductibility of accounting provisions has long been a potential contention when a business is sold. The Income Tax Act has specific sections that must be applied in determining the deductibility of accounting provisions, for example, section 11 (a), which is the general deduction formula; section 23 (g), which prohibits expenses not laid out for the purposes of trade; and section 23 (e), which does not allow a deduction when a reserve fund is created (for example a leave pay provision). In conducting this study, seven types of accounting provision generally recorded by businesses were identified: the bonus provision, leave pay provision, warranty provision, settlement discount and incentive-rebate provision, post employment provision, retrenchment <b>cost</b> <b>provision</b> and other provisions. These provisions are discussed in view of their possible income tax deductibility, and relevant case studies were identified to confirm the possible deductibility of these accounting provisions. In this study, the transfer of accounting provisions during the sale of a business is considered for the purposes of both the buyer and seller. The tax implications for the buyer and seller are then evaluated, as well as the subsequent treatment of the accounting provisions for the purposes of the buyer. Because the wording of the purchase contract is extremely important when a business is acquired, three examples of the wording of a purchase contract are discussed as well as the income tax implications thereof. The extent of the advice given by a tax practitioner will depend on the allegiance of the practitioner (either for the buyer or seller) and will determine how the contract will be concluded. In conclusion a tax practitioner would want to assist his client to obtain the most effective tax position for the transaction and therefore each purchase contract must be reviewed on its own set of facts...|$|E
40|$|A vast {{literature}} has identified {{the importance of}} childcare for understanding cross-national variation in women’s employment, and has particularly emphasised {{the role of the}} state in ensuring the delivery of services. This thesis explores variation within market-based childcare systems in order to understand how systems with less state provision may support or constrain maternal employment. The thesis argues that understanding whether childcare markets ‘work’ or not in supporting maternal employment requires a deep understanding of the interplay between market and state, as the specific policy approach taken can shape the structure of the market in profoundly different ways. This issue is explored via comparative case studies of the United States and the United Kingdom, two countries known for their market-based approach to childcare, but with stark and persistent differences in maternal employment behaviour, especially working time. Drawing on a mix of qualitative (policy documents) and quantitative (national statistics) data, the US and UK systems are compared along a series of dimensions comprising the two key components of the market-based system: the structure of market provision and the policy approach. The similarities and differences of these systems are analysed through the lens of the characteristics of services known to be important for the use of care for employment purposes: availability, cost and quality. The United States and United Kingdom have generally similar childcare systems when compared to other countries which rely more heavily on the state or the family to ensure childcare provision, which is in line with their common characterisation as liberal welfare regimes. However, there are important differences in the structure of their childcare markets which affect their ability to support maternal employment: for example, the US market poses fewer affordability constraints for maternal employment given the availability of relatively low cost care provision (albeit of questionable quality); the UK market in contrast provides care at higher cost, although this is likely of better quality. This variation in market provision is shaped by differences in the policy approach taken by each country: the US approach is primarily designed to soften the rougher edges of the market in what is otherwise considered a private sphere; in contrast the UK approach actively attempts to shape the childcare market into a system in line with policy goals. The consequence of this is that the US approach does not prevent a wide range of market provision from forming to cater to diverse tastes and budgets, but this necessarily includes a substantial degree of lower quality care. The UK approach more actively constrains the types of provision which are available, which on the one hand reduces supply and contributes to higher <b>cost</b> <b>provision,</b> but also sets higher standards for care provision. Together these findings suggest that understanding how market-based care systems do or do not support maternal employment requires not only an appreciation of the broader institutional context in which they are situated, but also the intended and unintended ways that policy-making can shape their structure...|$|E

40|$|M. Tech. Relative {{to other}} {{industries}} in South Africa and construction industries worldwide, the South African construction process generates {{a disproportionate number}} of fatalities, injuries and disease, the direct and indirect cost of which contribute to the cost of construction. Serious accidents and injuries resulting in personal injury and wrongful death occur with alarming frequency at construction sites in the U. K. The majority of accidents are not caused by careless workers but rather by failure to control. According to the Health and Safety Executive report published in 1988 out of the 90 % of all construction accidents leading to death 70 % could have been prevented by positive management actions and interventiion. Clients influence construction health and safety performance. Architects and design engineers often disavow responsibility for health and safety issues associated with the construction of their work. Arguably, this denial will only change if clients insist that construction health and safety is addressed on their projects. Health and safety begins with the attitude that accidents are preventable and that requirements for healthy and safe work practices must be followed. Health and safety should not be left solely {{under the control of the}} workers if injuries are to be curtailed or diminished, because the health and safety environment consists of many factors over which workers have little or no control. An underlying belief is that the majority of accidents are not caused by careless workers but by failure in controls. Although the best site management of health and safety cannot prevent all accidents, entities other than those actually performing the work do have an important role to play in enforcing proper safety standard measures : It is possible to prevent accidents from occurring. Success in health and safety has a great deal to do with people, especially those who will be responsible for ensuring that the project will be delivered safely. There is some evidence that the importance of health and safety is being realised by clients. Costs associated with worker injuries and fatalities are borne ultimately by the client and insisting that health and safety be included in design and construction considerations will prevent the occurrence of injuries and ultimately reduce the construction costs. Clients mostly set health and safety culture during the construction phase. Health and safety prequalification criteria to design approval post the design phase that shows that clients would prefer their involvement to be in specific phases. Clients do not realise that they can make significant contributions to improve health and safety performance during the early stages of a project. Clients who have to pay for construction work do not make specific <b>cost</b> <b>provision</b> for construction safety. Clients need to afford health and safety the same status as other project parameters. It is widely accepted that contractors should bear the responsibility for health and safety during the construction phase.

Again clients do not realise the significance of placing health and safety importance in the initial phases of a project...|$|E
40|$|The {{narrative}} of the United States is of a "nation of immigrants" in which the language shift patterns of earlier ethnolinguistic groups have tended towards linguistic assimilation through English. In recent years, however, changes in the demographic landscape and language maintenance by non-English speaking immigrants, particularly Hispanics, have been perceived as threats and have led to calls for an official English language policy. This thesis aims {{to contribute to the}} study of language policy making from a societal security perspective as expressed in attitudes regarding language and identity originating in the daily interaction between language groups. The focus is on the role of language and American identity in relation to immigration. The study takes an interdisciplinary approach combining language policy studies, security theory, and critical discourse analysis. The material consists of articles collected from four newspapers, namely USA Today, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and San Francisco Chronicle between April 2006 and December 2007. Two discourse types are evident from the analysis namely Loyalty and Efficiency. The former is mainly marked by concerns of national identity and contains speech acts of security related to language shift, choice and English for unity. Immigrants are represented as dehumanised, and harmful. Immigration is given as sovereignty-related, racial, and as war. The discourse type of Efficiency is mainly instrumental and contains speech acts of security related to <b>cost,</b> <b>provision</b> of services, health and safety, and social mobility. Immigrants are further represented as a labour resource. These discourse types reflect how the construction of the linguistic 'we' is expected to be maintained. Loyalty is triggered by arguments that the collective identity is threatened and is itself used in reproducing the collective 'we' through hegemonic expressions of monolingualism in the public space and semi-public space. The denigration of immigrants is used as a tool for enhancing societal security through solidarity and as a possible justification for the denial of minority rights. Also, although language acquisition patterns still follow the historical trend of language shift, factors indicating cultural separateness such as the appearance of speech communities or the use of minority languages in the public space and semi-public space have led to manifestations of intolerance. Examples of discrimination and prejudice towards minority groups indicate that the perception of worth of a shared language differs from the actual worth of dominant language acquisition for integration purposes. The study further indicates that the efficient working of the free market by using minority languages to sell services or buy labour is perceived as conflicting with nation-building notions since it may create separately functioning sub-communities with a new cultural capital recognised as legitimate competence. The discourse types mainly represent securitising moves constructing existential threats. The perception of threat and ideas of national belonging are primarily based on a zero-sum notion favouring monolingualism. Further, the identity of the immigrant individual is seen as dynamic and adaptable to assimilationist measures whereas the identity of the state and its members are perceived as static. Also, the study shows that debates concerning language status are linked to extra-linguistic matters. To conclude, policy makers in the US need to consider the relationship between four factors, namely societal security based on collective identity, individual/human security, human rights, and a changing linguistic demography, for proposed language intervention measures to be successful.

40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 P BSE 2015 Maxxxi, 302 leaves :illustrations (some color); 30 cmAt present, {{more than}} 1. 3 billion {{inhabitants}} worldwide still lack access to grid electricity. Most {{of the people}} live in remote areas, such as islands, mountain areas and isolated villages, all {{some distance from the}} utility grid. Grid extension to such remote communities is both uneconomical and technically difficult owing to dispersed population or rugged terrain. As a result, their electrical demand is normally met by use of diesel power or there is no power supply at all. Fortunately, such areas, although remote, are usually rich in renewable energy (RE) resources, thus making it worthwhile to explore such local RE resources with the objective of producing much needed electricity. In recent years, the unpredictability of diesel costs, falling RE generation costs as well as technological improvements have encouraged a wider adoption of renewable energies in such areas. Stand-alone renewable energy power generation systems have been the target of substantial research over the past decades. However, the focus on comprehensive renewable energy power supply solutions for remote areas, together with the identification of effective and low-cost technologies is limited. In addition, one significant technical challenge for those stand-alone RE systems, such as solar and wind energy, is the fluctuation of their output. This feature prevents the RE from being fully reliable for remote areas. In this context, the development of some effective energy storage solutions, to keep energy in excess for use in time of need, is an essential requirement. Currently battery must be a front-runner for use in remote RE systems. However, it has well known limitations, such as high cost, short lifespan, possibility of environmental damage and explosion, and difficulties for maintenance in isolated areas. Pumped hydro storage (PHS), usually used for conventional power plants, shows a great potential to replace batteries in standalone application, but to date few studies have reported the micro PHS for remote RE systems. The aim of this thesis is to study the options of power supply and energy storage for remote areas. One remote inhabited island 20 km off the coast of Hong Kong is taken to act as a test site for the proposed RE systems and storage technologies. To achieve the objectives of the study, a detailed study of different energy technologies for remote electrification was conducted, including system development, mathematical modeling, simulation, optimization, techno-economic evaluation, and sensitivity analysis. Different energy storage technologies, i. e. batteries, PHS, super-capacitors and their hybrids, are investigated via theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental validation. The operational performance of a real PV-battery system on this example island was evaluated. Firstly, the RE potential and load demand of the selected island were assessed. Mathematical models for each RE technology were developed, and system evaluation criteria discussed. In particular, a novel simulation model for PV devices, offering a good compromise between accuracy and simplicity, was developed in Matlab to fit the I-V curves and predict PV power output. The model was solved using an integrated analytical and numerical method, then validated through field measurements in a real grid-connected and a standalone PV system. A detailed study on the use of a traditional energy storage technology, battery, to support a remote area power generation system has been conducted. System configurations of possible combinations of solar energy, wind energy, diesel generator and battery bank were developed. Hourly simulations {{for a wide variety of}} configurations were performed to achieve an optimal one based on techno-economic analysis. Two representative systems, the 100 % RE and hybrid RE-diesel, were selected for deeper analysis. Emphasis was also placed on examinations of the effects of the PV, wind turbine, diesel generator, and battery bank capacity on the system{ 174 }s reliability and economic performance. The results demonstrated that the island could be powered by a 100 % RE system, although it is possible that the energy <b>cost</b> <b>provision</b> will be quite high. The addition of a back-up diesel generator would make the hybrid system, i. e. solar-wind-diesel-battery, a more economically viable option. The problems which were observed concerning batteries limit a wider and future application of the battery-based RE systems. Thus as an alternative, a small PHS unit was proposed to support the remote area RE power supply systems at a few hundred kW scale. Of interest is the development in this study of a novel operating principle and design process for PHS-based RE systems. With the simulation program developed in this study, the system was simulated for a whole year. The genetic algorithm, along with the Pareto optimality concept, was then employed for system optimization, i. e. to identify the maximization of power supply reliability and minimization of system cost. The optimized system configuration under zero loss of power supply probability (LPSP) was then investigated. In addition, the system performance of hybrid solar-wind, solar-alone and wind-alone systems with pumped storage under LPSPs from 0 to 5 % were compared. Sensitivity analysis on several key parameters was also performed to examine their effects on system performance. This study proposed a new concept of energy storage to compensate the intermittent nature of renewable energy applications. Even though the overall efficiency of the micro-scaled pumped storage system is not high, a sustainable and environmentally friendly power supply solution is able to be provided, indicating that the pumped storage is one future ideal partner for remote area RE power supply systems. Further investigation of the battery-based and PHS-based RE system indicates that the use of more than one storage technology will give a better performance as regards complementing fluctuating RE outputs and dynamic power demands. Therefore, a new hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which combines battery for long-term energy management and supercapacitor for fast dynamic power regulation, was proposed. The mathematical models of the passive connected HESS were developed, and then implemented in Matlab/Simulink for numerical simulations. An electric inductance was further introduced to improve the performance of the HESS. In addition, an experimental test bench was developed to validate simulation results. It was demonstrated that the HESS can stabilize energy provision, not only for intermittent RE, but also for other fluctuating load applications. Finally, the benefit of another kind HESS, a combination of pumped storage and battery energy storage system, was analyzed and the system was experimentally studied, as an illustration of the operation states of such hybrid energy storage technology. The operating data of a 19. 8 kWp solar PV-battery system on the island was collected and evaluated for the following aspects: the PV array, inverters, the battery bank and overall system. This evaluation enables a detailed understanding of the operating performance of the existing PV system from the technical point of view. It also provides useful reference data for further system extension. A comprehensive study of stand-alone RE power supply system using different energy storage solutions for remote areas with useful research outputs has been outlined above. The results provide researchers, engineers and policy makers with choices regarding the use of local RE resource, which could be aligned with the characteristics of individual remote area of interest. It is believed that the findings have provided a good reference for the selection of suitable RE and energy storage technologies, and the methodology presented can also be viewed as a starting point for planning and designing RE systems for remote communities around the world.
