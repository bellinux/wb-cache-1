The {{instances}} of a priori fallacy {{which we have}} hitherto cited belong to the class of vulgar errors, and do not now, nor in any but a rude age ever could, impose upon minds of any considerable attainments. But those to which {{we are about to}} proceed, have been, and still are, all but universally prevalent among thinkers. The same disposition to give objectivity to a law of the mind—to suppose that what is true of our ideas of things must be true of the things themselves—exhibits itself in many of the most accredited modes of philosophical investigation, both on physical and on metaphysical subjects. In one of its most undisguised manifestations, it embodies itself in two maxims, which lay claim to axiomatic truth: Things which we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of together, can not co-exist; and Things which we can not help thinking of together, must co-exist. I am not sure that the maxims were ever expressed in these precise words, but the history both of philosophy and of popular opinions abounds with exemplifications of both forms of the doctrine.|$|E
60|$|After the {{recognition}} and definition, then, of the infimæ species, {{the next step}} is to arrange those infimæ species into larger groups: making these groups correspond to Kinds wherever it is possible, but in most cases without any such guidance. And in doing this it is true that we are naturally and properly guided, in most cases at least, by resemblance to a type. We form our groups round certain selected Kinds, each of which serves as a sort of exemplar of its group. But though the groups are suggested by types, I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that a group when formed is determined by the type; that in deciding whether a species belongs to the group, a reference is made to the type, and not to the characters; that the characters “can not be expressed in words.” This assertion is inconsistent with Dr. Whewell’s own statement of the fundamental principle of classification, namely, that “general assertions shall be possible.” If the class did not possess any characters in common, what general assertions would be possible respecting it? Except that they all resemble each other more than they resemble any thing else, nothing whatever could be predicated of the class.|$|E

Among the {{remaining}} forms of erroneous generalization, {{several of those}} most worthy of and most requiring notice have fallen under our examination in former places, where, in investigating the rules of correct induction, we have had occasion to advert to the distinction between it and some common mode of the incorrect. In this number is what I have formerly called the natural Induction of uninquiring minds, the induction of the ancients, which proceeds per enumerationem simplicem: “This, that, and the other A are B, I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of any A which is not B, therefore every A is B.” As a final condemnation of this rude and slovenly mode of generalization, I will quote Bacon’s emphatic denunciation of it; the most important part, as I have more than once ventured to assert, of the permanent service rendered by him to philosophy. “Inductio quæ procedit per enumerationem simplicem, res puerilis est, et precario concludit” (concludes only by your leave, or provisionally), “et periculo exponitur ab instantiâ contradictoriâ, et plerumque secundum pauciora quam par est, et ex his tantummodo quæ præsto sunt pronunciat. At Inductio quæ ad inventionem et demonstrationem Scientiarum et Artium erit utilis, Naturam separare debet, per rejectiones et exclusiones debitas; ac deinde post negativas tot quot sufficiunt, super affirmativas concludere.” ...|$|E
60|$|That {{there should}} be, in every polity, a centre of {{resistance}} to the predominant power in the Constitution--and in a democratic constitution, therefore, a nucleus {{of resistance to the}} democracy--I have already maintained; and I regard it as a fundamental maxim of government. If any people who possess a democratic representation are, from their historical antecedents, more willing to tolerate such a {{centre of resistance}} {{in the form of a}} Second Chamber or House of Lords than in any other shape, this constitutes a stronger reason for having it in that shape. But it does not appear to me the best shape in itself, nor by any means the most efficacious for its object. If there are two houses, one considered to represent the people, the other to represent only a class, or not to be representative at all, I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that, where democracy is the ruling power in society, the second House would have any real ability to resist even the aberrations of the first. It might be suffered to exist in deference to habit and association, but not as an effective check. If it exercised an independent will, it would be required to do so in the same general spirit as the other House; to be equally democratic with it, and to content itself with correcting the accidental oversights of the more popular branch of the Legislature, or competing with it in popular measures.|$|E

Since the only direct effect of the bribe was his absence, [...] the bribe could be called the remote cause of the surprise, only on [...] the supposition that the absence was the proximate cause; nor does [...] it seem to me that any one (who had not a theory to support) would [...] use the one expression and reject the other.|$|E

First, because it could not, in such circumstances, be supposed to be needful. Let us only conceive the state of things which the hypothesis implies: a people universally educated, and every grown-up human being possessed of a vote. If, even when only a small proportion are electors, and {{the majority of the population}} almost uneducated, public opinion is already, as every one now sees that it is, the ruling power in the last resort, it is a chimera to suppose that over a community who all read, and who all have votes, any power could be exercised by landlords and rich people against their own inclination, which it would be at all difficult for them to throw off. But, though the protection of secrecy would then be needless, the control of publicity would be as needful as ever. The universal observation of mankind has been very fallacious, if the mere fact of being one of the community, and not being in a position of pronounced contrariety of interest to the public at large, is enough to insure the performance of a public duty, without either the stimulus or the restraint derived from the opinion of our fellow-creatures. A man's own particular share of the public interest, even though he may have no private interest drawing him in the opposite direction, is not, as a general rule, found sufficient to make him do his duty to the public without other external inducements. Neither can it be admitted that, even if all had votes, they would give their votes as honestly in secret as in public.|$|E
6000|$|The {{objection}} I have to {{this language}} {{is that it}} confounds, or at [...] least confuses, a much more important distinction than that which it [...] draws. The only reason for dividing Propositions into real and [...] verbal, is in order to discriminate propositions which convey [...] information about facts, from those which do not. A proposition [...] which affirms that an object has a given attribute, while [...] designating the object by a name which already signifies the [...] attribute, adds no information to that which was already possessed [...] by all who understood the name. But when this is said, it is implied [...] that, by the signification of a name, is meant the signification [...] attached {{to it in the}} common usage of life. I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> we ought [...] to say that the meaning of a word includes matters of fact which are [...] unknown to every person who uses the word unless he has learned them [...] by special study of a particular department of Nature; or that [...] because a few persons are aware of these matters of fact, the [...] affirmation of them is a proposition conveying no information. I [...] hold that (special scientific connotation apart) a name means, or [...] connotes, only the properties which it is a mark of in the general [...] mind; and {{that in the case of}} any additional properties, however [...] uniformly found to accompany these, it remains possible that a thing [...] which did not possess the properties might still be thought entitled [...] to the name. Ruminant, according to Mr. Bain’s use of language, [...] connotes cloven-hoofed, since the two properties are always found [...] together, and no connection has ever been discovered between them: [...] but ruminant does not mean cloven-hoofed; and were an animal to be [...] discovered which chews the cud, but has its feet undivided, I [...] venture to say that it would still be called ruminant.|$|E
6000|$|This doctrine, {{like that}} of Mr. De Morgan {{previously}} noticed, is a [...] real addition to the syllogistic theory; and has moreover this [...] advantage over Mr. De Morgan’s “numerically definite Syllogism,” [...] that the forms it supplies are really available {{as a test of}} the [...] correctness of ratiocination; since propositions in the common form [...] may always have their predicates quantified, and so be made amenable [...] to Sir W. Hamilton’s rules. Considered, however, as a contribution [...] to the Science of Logic, that is, to the analysis of the mental [...] processes concerned in reasoning, the new doctrine appears to me, I [...] confess, not merely superfluous, but erroneous; since the form in [...] which it clothes propositions does not, like the ordinary form, [...] express what is {{in the mind of the}} speaker when he enunciates the [...] proposition. I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> Sir William Hamilton right in [...] maintaining that the quantity of the predicate is “always understood [...] in thought.” It is implied, but is not present to the mind of the [...] person who asserts the proposition. The quantification of the [...] predicate, instead of being a means of bringing out more clearly the [...] meaning of the proposition, actually leads the mind out of the [...] proposition, into another order of ideas. For when we say, All men [...] are mortal, we simply mean to affirm the attribute mortality of all [...] men; without thinking at all of the class mortal in the concrete, [...] or troubling ourselves about whether it contains any other beings or [...] not. It is only for some artificial purpose that we ever look at the [...] proposition in the aspect in which the predicate also is thought of [...] as a class-name, either including the subject only, or the subject [...] and something more.

6000|$|But {{although}} the extreme {{doctrine of the}} Idealist metaphysicians, that objects are nothing but our sensations and the laws which connect them, has not been generally adopted by subsequent thinkers; the point of most real importance is one on which those metaphysicians are now very generally considered to have made out their case: viz., that all we know of objects is the sensations which they give us, and {{the order of the}} occurrence of those sensations. Kant himself, on this point, is as explicit as Berkeley or Locke. However firmly convinced that there exists a universe of “Things in themselves,” totally distinct from the universe of phenomena, or of things as they appear to our senses; and even when bringing into use a technical expression (Noumenon) to denote what the thing is in itself, as contrasted with the representation of it in our minds; he allows that this representation (the matter of which, he says, consists of our sensations, though the form is given by the laws of the mind itself) is all we know of the object: and that the real nature of the Thing is, and by the constitution of our faculties ever must remain, at least in the present state of existence, an impenetrable mystery to us. “Of things absolutely or in themselves,” says Sir William Hamilton,(19) “be they external, be they internal, we know nothing, or know them only as incognizable; and become aware of their incomprehensible existence, only as this is indirectly and accidentally revealed to us, through certain qualities related to our faculties of knowledge, and which qualities, again, we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> as unconditional, irrelative, existent in and of ourselves. All that we know is therefore phenomenal—phenomenal of the unknown.”(20) The same doctrine is laid down in the clearest and strongest terms by M. Cousin, whose observations on the subject are the more worthy of attention, as, in consequence of the ultra-German and ontological character of his philosophy in other respects, they may be regarded as the admissions of an opponent.(21) ...|$|E
6000|$|Two {{hours from}} Tabor to Nazareth--and {{as it was}} an uncommonly narrow, crooked trail, we {{necessarily}} met all the camel trains and jackass caravans between Jericho and Jacksonville in that particular place and nowhere else. The donkeys do not matter so much, {{because they are so}} small that you can jump your horse over them if he is an animal of spirit, but a camel is not jumpable. A camel is as tall as any ordinary dwelling-house in Syria--which is to say a camel is from one to two, and sometimes nearly three feet taller than a good-sized man. In {{this part of the country}} his load is oftenest in the shape of colossal sacks--one on each side. He and his cargo take up as much room as a carriage. Think of meeting this style of obstruction in a narrow trail. The camel would not turn out for a king. He stalks serenely along, bringing his cushioned stilts forward with the long, regular swing of a pendulum, and whatever is in the way must get out of the way peaceably, or be wiped out forcibly by the bulky sacks. It was a tiresome ride to us, and perfectly exhausting to the horses. We were compelled to jump over upwards of eighteen hundred donkeys, and only one person in the party was unseated less than sixty times by the camels. This seems like a powerful statement, but the poet has said, [...] "Things are not what they seem." [...] I <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of any thing, now, more certain to make one shudder, than to have a soft-footed camel sneak up behind him and touch him on the ear with its cold, flabby under-lip. A camel did this for one of the boys, who was drooping over his saddle in a brown study. He glanced up and saw the majestic apparition hovering above him, and made frantic efforts to get out of the way, but the camel reached out and bit him on the shoulder before he accomplished it. This was the only pleasant incident of the journey.|$|E
60|$|To {{begin with}} the latter of them: Things which we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of except together, must exist together. This is assumed in the {{generally}} received and accredited mode of reasoning which concludes that A must accompany B in point of fact, because “it {{is involved in the}} idea.” Such thinkers do not reflect that the idea, being a result of abstraction, ought to conform to the facts, and can not make the facts conform to it. The argument is at most admissible as an appeal to authority; a surmise, that what is now part of the idea, must, before it became so, have been found by previous inquirers in the facts. Nevertheless, the philosopher who more than all others made professions of rejecting authority, Descartes, constructed his system on this very basis. His favorite device for arriving at truth, even in regard to outward things, was by looking into his own mind for it. “Credidi me,” says his celebrated maxim, “pro regulâ generali sumere posse, omne id quod valdè dilucidè et distinctè concipiebam, verum esse;” whatever can be very clearly conceived must certainly exist; that is, as he afterward explains it, if the idea includes existence. And on this ground he infers that geometrical figures really exist, because they can be distinctly conceived. Whenever existence is “involved in an idea,” a thing conformable to the idea must really exist; which is as much as to say, whatever the idea contains must have its equivalent in the thing; and what we are not able to leave out of the idea can not be absent from the reality.(232) This assumption pervades the philosophy not only of Descartes, but of all the thinkers who received their impulse mainly from him, in particular the two most remarkable among them, Spinoza and Leibnitz, from whom the modern German metaphysical philosophy is essentially an emanation. I am indeed disposed to think that the fallacy now under consideration has been the cause of two-thirds of the bad philosophy, and especially of the bad metaphysics, which the human mind has never ceased to produce. Our general ideas contain nothing but what has been put into them, either by our passive experience, or by our active habits of thought; and the metaphysicians in all ages, who have attempted to construct the laws of the universe by reasoning from our supposed necessities of thought, have always proceeded, and only could proceed, by laboriously finding in their own minds what they themselves had formerly put there, and evolving from their ideas of things what they had first involved in those ideas. In this way all deeply-rooted opinions and feelings are enabled to create apparent demonstrations of their truth and reasonableness, as it were, out of their own substance.|$|E
