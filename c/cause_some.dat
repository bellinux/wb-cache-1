5|$|As {{the rebel}} forces {{advanced}} towards his enemy's line, Alexios's flankers sprung their ambush. Their attack did indeed <b>cause</b> <b>some</b> initial confusion, but Bryennios (or, {{according to the}} Alexiad, his brother John, who commanded the right wing) rallied his men and led forth the second line. This counter-attack broke Alexios's flankers; as they retreated in panic, they fell upon the Immortals, who also panicked and fled, abandoning their posts. Although they suffered some casualties from Bryennios's pursuing men, most managed to escape well {{to the rear of}} Alexios's army.|$|E

5|$|Due to its perception-altering effects, {{the onset}} of {{narcosis}} {{may be hard to}} recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or cannabis and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they <b>cause</b> <b>some</b> immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
5|$|The assault at Zeebrugge a {{few miles}} away from Ostend was more {{successful}} and the blocking of the major channel did <b>cause</b> <b>some</b> consternation amongst the German forces in Bruges. The larger raiders could no longer leave the port, but smaller ships, including most submarines, were still able to traverse via Ostend. In addition, within hours a narrow channel had also been carved through Zeebrugge too, although British intelligence did not realise this for several weeks. The defeat at Ostend did not entirely dampen the exuberant British media and public reaction to Zeebrugge, but in the Admiralty and particularly in the Allied Naval and Marine Forces the failure to completely neutralise Bruges rankled.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} failure modes were loss of {{sensitivity}} caused by dust infiltrating the speaker panels, and internal arcing of the panels caused by excessive {{power to the}} step-up transformer; use at high altitudes may also cause the same effect.

5|$|The {{position}} of unbiunium in {{the periodic table}} suggests {{that it would have}} similar properties to its lighter congeners, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium; however, relativistic effects may <b>cause</b> <b>some</b> of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, unbiunium is expected to have a s2p valence electron configuration instead of the s2d of its lighter congeners in group 3, but this is not expected to significantly affect its chemistry, which is predicted to be that of a normal group 3 element; it would on the other hand significantly lower its first ionisation energy beyond what would be expected from periodic trends.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion of the knee, though it may <b>cause</b> <b>some</b> discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension of the knee may cause crepitus.|$|E
5|$|Fungi are {{important}} crop pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect {{a wide range}} of crops around the world, <b>cause</b> <b>some</b> 85% of plant diseases, and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi involved is also wide, including Ascomycetes such as Fusarium causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smuts and Puccinia causing cereal rusts, and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where crop diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire crop, as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured crop of maize (corn) in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' seedless banana crop was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, Fusarium oxysporum. It was replaced by the Cavendish banana, which in turn was in 2015 facing total destruction by the same disease.|$|E

5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to <b>cause</b> <b>some</b> concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E
5|$|Syndromes {{in which}} causes are not clearly {{identified}} {{are difficult to}} match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The idiopathic (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic <b>cause.</b> <b>Some</b> childhood epilepsy syndromes {{are included in the}} unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Others are included in symptomatic despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized symptomatic but it was argued to include these within the category idiopathic. Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth {{generated}} primarily by dime-novel authors in the late 19th century. An estimate of 20,000 men in the American West were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900, and over 21,586 total casualties during the American Indian Wars from 1850 to 1890. The most notable and well-known {{took place in the}} states/territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Actual gunfights in the Old West were very rare, very few and far between, but when gunfights did occur, the cause for each varied. Some were simply the result of the heat of the moment, while others were longstanding feuds, or between bandits and lawmen. Lawless violence such as range wars like the Lincoln County War and clashes with Indians were also a <b>cause.</b> <b>Some</b> of these shootouts became famous, while others faded into history with only a few accounts surviving. To prevent gunfights from happening, many cities in the American frontier, such as Dodge City and Tombstone, put up a local ordinance to prohibit firearms in the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{wild parsnip}} {{from which the}} modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures <b>cause</b> <b>some</b> of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} of Category 3 {{and higher}} {{are described as}} major hurricanes in the Atlantic or Eastern Pacific basins. These storms can <b>cause</b> <b>some</b> structural damage to small residences and utility buildings, particularly those of wood frame or manufactured materials with minor curtain wall failures. Buildings that lack a solid foundation, such as mobile homes, are usually destroyed, and gable-end roofs are peeled off. Manufactured homes usually sustain severe and irreparable damage. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures, while larger structures are struck by floating debris. A large number of trees are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. Additionally, terrain may be flooded well inland. Near-total to total power loss is likely for up to several weeks and water will likely also be lost or contaminated.|$|E
5|$|Ununennium is {{the element}} with the {{smallest}} atomic number {{that has not yet}} been synthesized. Multiple attempts have been made by American, German, and Russian teams to synthesize this element: they have all been unsuccessful, as experimental evidence has shown that the synthesis of ununennium will likely be far more difficult than that of the previous elements, and it may even be the penultimate element that can be synthesized with current technology. Planned attempts by Japanese and Russian teams are scheduled for 2019–2020. Its position as the seventh alkali metal suggests that it would have similar properties to its lighter congeners: lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium; however, relativistic effects may <b>cause</b> <b>some</b> of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, ununennium is expected to be less reactive than caesium and francium and to be closer in behavior to potassium or rubidium, and while it should show the characteristic +1 oxidation state of the alkali metals, it is also predicted to show the +3 oxidation state unknown in any other alkali metal.|$|E
