5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, White was in support of preserving the United States. In the United States presidential election of 1860, White supported <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Union</b> Party presidential candidate John Bell and his running mate Edward Everett. The <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Union</b> Party was formed by former Whig Party members seeking to avoid secessionism over the issue of slavery. In 1861, White voted for Union candidates to serve as delegates from Hampshire County in the Virginia secession convention, one of which was his son-in-law Colonel E.M. Armstrong.|$|E
5|$|After Southern Democrats {{walked out}} of the 1860 Democratic National Convention, the party's {{northern}} and southern factions held rival conventions in Baltimore that nominated Douglas and Breckinridge, respectively, for president. A third party, the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Union</b> Party, nominated John Bell. These three men split the Southern vote, while more anti-slavery Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln won all but three electoral votes in the North, allowing him to win the election. Breckinridge carried most of the Southern states. Taking his seat in the Senate, Breckinridge urged compromise to preserve the Union. Unionists were in control of the state legislature, and gained more support when Confederate forces moved into Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|From 1858 to 1860, Crittenden {{sought out}} moderates from all {{sections}} {{of the country to}} effect compromise on the territorial and slavery issues, thus averting war. In 1860, he was named chair of the National Union Executive Committee, a group of congressmen and journalists who feared that sectional differences would destroy the Union. His efforts helped form the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Union</b> Party later that year. Chosen as the keynote speaker at the party's national convention on May 9, 1860, many urged him to become their nominee for president. At age seventy-three, however, Crittenden was already contemplating retirement and instead orchestrated the nomination of John Bell, whom he actively supported in the 1860 presidential race.|$|E

Louisville cast 3,823 votes for John Bell. Douglas received 2,633 votes.|$|E
25|$|The {{divisions}} became fully exposed {{with the}} 1860 presidential election. The electorate split four ways. The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery, while the Republicans denounced it. The Northern Democrats said democracy required {{the people to}} decide on slavery locally, state by state and territory by territory. The <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Union</b> Party said {{the survival of the}} Union was at stake and everything else should be compromised.|$|E
50|$|Eight ministers, {{including}} Machen, {{were tried}} in the General Assembly of 1936. They were convicted and removed from the ministry.

50|$|Macartney urged Machen to compromise, but he refused. In June 1935, {{he set up}} the Presbyterian <b>Constitutional</b> Covenant <b>Union.</b> In October, {{the split}} between Macartney and Machen spread to Westminster Seminary, where the faculty, led by Machen, called {{on the board of}} {{trustees}} to announce their support of the Independent Board of Foreign Missions and the Covenant Union.

25|$|Historian Allan Nevins, for instance, {{writes of}} {{political}} rallies in 1856 with turnouts of anywhere from twenty to fifty thousand men and women. Voter turnouts even ran {{as high as}} 84% by 1860. An abundance of new parties emerged 1854–56, including the Republicans, People's party men, Anti-Nebraskans, Fusionists, Know-Nothings, Know-Somethings (anti-slavery nativists), Maine Lawites, Temperance men, Rum Democrats, Silver Gray Whigs, Hindus, Hard Shell Democrats, Soft Shells, Half Shells and Adopted Citizens. By 1858, they were mostly gone, and politics divided four ways. Republicans controlled most Northern states with a strong Democratic minority. The Democrats were split North and South and fielded two tickets in 1860. Southern non-Democrats tried different coalitions; most supported the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Union</b> party in 1860.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his time}} as governor, {{he was elected to}} the Delaware Senate and served in three sessions, from the 1849/50 session through the 1853/54 session. With the demise of the Whig Party, he was too {{conservative}} to support the agenda of Stephen A. Douglas, but too fearful of disunion to support the Republican Party or the eventual candidacy of John C. Breckinridge. In the election of 1860 he sought the elusive middle ground, and was one of the Delaware leaders of the short lived <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Union</b> Party. This party supported the right of each state to decide the slavery question, but argued that somehow that right could be preserved within the Union.|$|E

50|$|In the denominational {{politics}} of the following decade, Macartney often advocated a more moderate approach than that favored by J. Gresham Machen. Although he initially opposed founding Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929 when Princeton Theological Seminary was re-organized by the denomination along semi-modernist lines, he agreed to serve on Westminster's board. He opposed Machen's creation of an independent missions board, and, after Machen was censured for setting up this board, Macartney also opposed Machen's Presbyterian <b>Constitutional</b> Covenant <b>Union.</b> Ultimately Macartney resigned from Westminster's board rather than go along with these developments.|$|R

25|$|Politically, the Commonwealth had {{produced}} {{some of the}} country's best known leaders. Former Vice-Presidents John C. Breckinridge and Richard M. Johnson both hailed from the state, as did Henry Clay, John J. Crittenden, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, and Confederate President Jefferson Davis. However, {{by the time of}} the Civil War, Kentucky was in a politically confused state. The decline of the Whig Party, which Clay had founded, had left many politicians looking for an identity. Many joined the Democratic Party, a few joined the newly formed Republican Party, while still others associated with one of numerous minor parties such as the Know Nothing Party. In the 1860 presidential election, the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Union</b> Party, with Tennessee-native John Bell as its presidential candidate and Massachusetts-native Edward Everett as its vice-presidential candidate, won the state. The party was composed mainly of former Whigs and Know-Nothings.|$|E
25|$|Biggs was the Democratic {{candidate}} for the U.S. House in the 1860 election, but was narrowly defeated by the People’s Party candidate, George P. Fisher. The People’s Party was a local coalition of the Republicans and <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Union</b> Party, and the positions of people, like Fisher, on the great {{issues of the day}} were not yet clear. By 1868 they were, and after Delaware had experienced the humiliation of Federal supervision of its polling places, and the forced emancipation of its few slaves, a large majority turned permanently to the candidates of the Democratic Party. When Biggs ran again for the U.S. House, he was easily elected, defeating Republican Alfred T. Torbert in the 1868 election, and Joshua T. Heald in the 1870 election. But popularity in Delaware did not result in anything useful in the U.S. House, as Biggs joined a small and powerless minority in the 41st and 42nd Congress. He served two terms, from March 4, 1869 until March 3, 1873, during the administration of U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and then retired, back to his peach orchards.|$|E
25|$|The Democrats split {{over the}} choice of a {{successor}} to President James Buchanan along Northern and Southern lines; factions of the party provided two separate candidacies for president in the election of 1860, in which the Republican Party gained ascendancy. The radical pro-slavery Fire-Eaters led a walkout at both the April Democratic convention in Charleston's Institute Hall and the June convention in Baltimore when the national party would not adopt a resolution supporting the extension of slavery into territories even if the voters of those territories did not want it. These Southern Democrats nominated the pro-slavery incumbent vice president, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, for president and General Joseph Lane, former Governor of Oregon, for vice president. The Northern Democrats nominated Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for president and former Governor of Georgia Herschel V. Johnson for vice president, while some southern Democrats joined the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Union</b> Party, backing its nominees (who had both been prominent Whig leaders), former Senator, Speaker of the House, and Secretary of War John Bell of Tennessee for president and the politician, statesman, and educator Edward Everett of Massachusetts for vice president. This fracturing of the Democrats led to a Republican victory, and Abraham Lincoln was elected the 16th President of the United States.|$|E

5000|$|The Riksakten was the 1815 Act of Union that {{regulated}} {{the terms}} of the <b>constitutional</b> personal <b>union</b> between Sweden and Norway established in 1814. The fundamental documents of the union were only the Convention of Moss and the revised Norwegian constitution of 4 November 1814.
