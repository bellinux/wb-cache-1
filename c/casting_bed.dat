50|$|Even though {{years of}} {{experience}} accounts for a good gauge for the appropriate lifting anchor to be used, {{it should not be}} left to the reinforcement fabricators and precast factory personnel to select the lifting anchor. The design engineer should specifically account for the applied loads expected during the lifting, transport and placement (or re-usability requirements) of the element. Flexure, <b>casting</b> <b>bed</b> suction, load direction (axial ‘tensile’, angular ‘sling’, transverse ‘shear’) are also load considerations to be accounted for in the lifting design of the element.The anchor selection, together with additional reinforcement, and rigging arrangements is influenced by:- The dead weight of the element- The number of anchors in the element and the configuration of the anchor- Capacity of the anchor at the specific concrete compressive strengths at time of lift- The dynamic loads applied during lifting (suction to the <b>casting</b> <b>bed,</b> or crane dynamics)- The rigging configurationAll of the above factors must be taken into consideration during the lifting design phase of the element.The weight of the element can be determined by the calculated volume, and using the specific gravity (normal weight reinforced concrete is approximately 24 kN/m3).Establishing the lifting anchor positions will influence the rigging arrangements used and therefore the static analysis of the rigging should be determined. Particular rigging configurations may be more suitable for particular job sites or lifting in place considerations, and the lifting design should denote the assumptions accordingly. For example, the statically determined systems, shown in Figure 3, where the determination of the loads is not always possible.Dynamic loads considered in lifting design are accounted for in two stages; suction to the <b>casting</b> <b>bed</b> on the initial lift and then the dynamic loads induced from crane vibration. These crane impact loads must be accounted for during transportation in the yard and on-site, and the coefficient increases from an overhead gantry crane through to a crane moving over rough terrain. Consideration for the entire transportation loads {{must be taken into account}} during the lifting design.Anchor capacity, or load resistance, should be considered for tensile loads (axial), sling angle (angular) and shear loads (transverse). Consideration of different load combinations may result in wide variations required from the lifting insert. The load directions during production, transport and placement should be considered carefully. Depending on the planned load direction, either a different anchor may be included in the lifting design, alternatively, reinforcement may be included to reduce the possibility of element flexure crack damage. The configuration (size, position and quantity) of this reinforcement should be supplemented to the element reinforcement design to ensure for adequate capacity of the lifting design.Lifting design is influenced by the steel / concrete interaction of the specific anchor selected. Different load cases are considered by the lifting design engineer, such as anchor susceptibility to edge distance, placement sensitivity, and anchor capacity at the specific concrete strength at time of lift. For example, a footed pin head style anchor maybe more susceptible to edge distance than a hairpin style anchor. Or a splayed anchor does not have the same tensile/axial capacity with the equivalent anchor length (effective embedment is greater on a footed anchor than a splayed anchor of equivalent overall length, see figure 4).|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Fabricators and {{contractors}} need accurate prediction of the camber in precast, prestressed, concrete girders. Large {{differences in the}} camber between adjacent girders lead to significant construction difficulties that often have financial and/or legal ramifications. Many factors affect the time-dependent deflections of these girders including; creep and shrinkage of concrete, prestressing relaxation, temperature variations and numerous fabrication conditions. The current models used to predict the deflection history are largely empirical and, although they account approximately {{for some of the}} important effects, they do not explicitly consider the interactions among these factors. The goal of this research was to generate a camber prediction algorithm that links the time-dependent constitutive models and explicitly considers the fabrication conditions. This was done by using classical structural analysis techniques and combining them with explicit, time-dependent material models. The analysis was divided into four time phases that encompass a girder's life-span, from fabrication through it service life. These phases are: *	Strand jacking: The phase during which the prestressing strands are brought up to their specified jacking stress, *	Pre-bonding: The phase during which the prestressing strands are anchored to the abutments in the <b>casting</b> <b>bed,</b> but the strands have not yet bonded to the surrounding concrete, *	Post-bonding: The phase during which the concrete has bonded to the strands, but the girder is still resting in the <b>casting</b> <b>bed,</b> and the strands are still restrained by the abutments. *	Post-release: The phase during which the prestressing strands have been released from the abutments and the girder is removed from the <b>casting</b> <b>bed.</b> This phase includes the entire service life. In each of these four phases, the boundary conditions are different and the system is analyzed to determine the stresses, deformations and deflected shape. The calculations are necessarily iterative because the constitutive laws for the strand and concrete are time-dependent. The foundation of this analysis method is the proper time-dependent constitutive models. A time-dependent constitutive model was developed for concrete creep using basic Kelvin-Voigt rheological models, modified to include time-dependent parameters. This new model was then calibrated against currently accepted creep models in order to optimize model parameters for a specific girder concrete. For the time-dependent strand relaxation model, the model proposed by Bazant and Yu (2012) was used. Unlike the commonly used Magura model (1964) this model is capable of addressing variable stress loading. It also accounts for the key factors that affect relaxation, including temperature and variations in strain. This model was calibrated against relaxation data. Using these calibrated material constitutive models, the camber prediction algorithm was used to predict the pre-release material stresses as well as the camber history for a girder. The resulting predictions were compared with measured cambers at release and up to ten hours after release. The resulting predictions were reasonable and resulted in expected trends. The predictions also compared favorably with the AASHTO (2012) model for long-term predictions...|$|E
40|$|Casting, cooling and crushing/sieving of ferroalloys has {{followed}} a well-established {{pattern in the}} whole ferroalloys industry for many years. Usually liquid metal or alloys are cast into flat open moulds of various shapes and forms, and after solidification the product is removed from such mould to further cool down to a temperature where subsequent handling steps are feasible.

40|$|During {{the casting}} of {{ferromanganese}} alloys from electric arc furnaces into sand beds at temperatures {{of up to}} 1800 °C {{a considerable amount of}} very brown fumes are generated when the alloy fume is oxidized in the atmosphere. The fume is difficult to capture because of the large flux of gas that is generated. Possible reasons for this flux include the high evaporation rate of Mn at elevated temperatures, the large surface area of the casting beds and the large thermal plumes over the furnace tapholes and casting beds. It has been found that the use of fine water sprays {{along the edge of the}} roof that covers the <b>casting</b> <b>bed</b> resulted in a significant reduction in visible emissions. This paper describes research into the kinetics of the fume to improve the design of the capture hoods, as well as the mechanism of suppression by the water sprays by using CFD analysis. It is shown that the oxidation reaction produces less than 20 % of the energy content of the plume over the arc furnace taphole, and also that radiation heat transfer may play an important role in increasing the energy content of the taphole plume. The capture of fume particles by fine spray droplets is shown to have limited efficiency, while the heat sink that is caused by evaporation does not materially contribute to the circulation of fume through the spray. It is postulated that the increased moisture content of the air over the casting beds may be instrumental in reducing the oxygen partial pressure or in the formation of an oxide layer, both of which would reduce metal evaporation and, therefore fume formation. The exact mechanism requires further investigation. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 This {{thesis is}} the {{consequence}} of a research effort undertaken by the School of Civil and Construction Engineering at Oregon State University and funded by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The principal objective of the effort was to reduce the life cycle cost of bridges by developing one or more materials systems for precast and pre-stressed bridge deck components that improve the studded tire wear (abrasion) resistance and durability of bridge decks. Degradation of the concrete bridge decks due to abrasion caused by the studded tires and accelerated corrosion of the reinforcing steel in the concrete often triggers costly, premature rehabilitation or replacement of these bridges. High performance concrete (HPC) can provide improved abrasion resistance, but is more costly than ordinary concrete and can exhibit early age cracking when used for cast-in-place concrete members, which can accelerate corrosion of embedded reinforcing steel. However, several {{studies have suggested that}} HPC developed for precast members offers a viable alternative to cast-in-place concrete deck slabs due in part to improved control of the curing process. The scope of this research was to develop one or more mixture designs for HPC that improve the durability and abrasion resistance of the bridge decks through careful selection and proper proportioning of the constituent materials and improved control of the curing process. The materials investigated in this research included silica fume, slag, and fly ash as partial replacement of Type I and Type III portland cement mixed with crushed aggregate and river gravel. Phase I of the study included development of 15 mixture designs incorporating various combinations of the materials. Mixtures were cast under controlled laboratory conditions and cured using a variety of methods. The results of tests conducted on the cured samples indicated that the mixture with silica fume and slag had greater strength than the mixture with silica fume and fly ash mixture, and that mixtures with crushed rock provided better abrasion resistance than those with river gravel. Results from the chloride ion penetration test for permeability indicated that mixtures cured in saturated lime water for 28 days exhibited reduced permeability in comparison to mixtures which were steam cured followed by ambient curing. Following phase I, a pilot study was undertaken to identify the best curing method to apply during production at precast yards to assist high early strength gain so that the concrete member can be removed from the <b>casting</b> <b>bed</b> in a matter of several hours as well as to facilitate high ultimate strength, improved abrasion resistance, and low permeability. The pilot study indicated the best curing method to be steam curing followed by application of a curing compound. Phase II of the research study included seven mix designs and focused on various levels of supplementary cementitious materials. It adopted the curing method suggested by the pilot study. Results from phase II indicated that slag was better in enhancing durability of the concrete than fly ash. Increasing the proportion of silica fume did not improve the properties of high performance concrete significantly. Some other interesting results indicated that compressive strength was inversely proportional to wear rate and chloride ion penetration. Wear rate was directly proportional to chloride ion penetration. There was no relationship between durability factor (freeze-thaw test) and compressive strength or chloride ion penetration. Two mixtures were identified as having significantly improved abrasion and permeability characteristics over the control mixture (ODOT bridge deck mixture). Both included slag and silica fume as supplementary cementitious materials as a partial replacement of portland cement and one did not contain an air entraining admixture...|$|E

40|$|Agarose, {{the most}} {{commonly}} employed chromatography base material in industrial purification processes for biomolecules – proteins, has almost ideal properties. The major disadvantage of the agarose support is its poor mechanical strength which excludes its use in high speed separations where small particles are {{needed in order to}} achieve improved chromatographic efficiency. This drawback can be reduced by cross-linking the agarose. A different approach, exploited in this work, is to introduce the concept of intraparticle convective flow {{to be able to use}} comparatively large agarose beads which tolerate higher flow rates and still achieve high efficiency. Thus, this thesis describes superporous agarose as a support material for chromatography. Superporous agarose beads in sizes varying between 50 - 500 µm were prepared. Apart from normal diffusion pores, these beads contain large flow pores (about 5 - 50 µm) in which chromatographed substances are transported by flow to the interior of each bead. This intraparticle convective flow significantly reduces the distance which must be covered by the slow diffusion process giving an improved mass transport. Superporous agarose beads were derivatized with different functional groups and their performance compared with corresponding homogeneous agarose beads in ion exchange-, affinity- and hydrophobic interaction chromatography separations of proteins. In these chromatographic modes superporous beads performed considerably better than homogeneous beads. In a separate study, convective fluid velocities inside superporous agarose beads were directly measured for the first time by following the movement of micro particles in a packed bed. The fluid velocity data obtained were compared with and found to agree with theoretically calculated values based on the Kozeny–Carman equation. Superporous agarose can also be prepared as continuous gels in the form of <b>cast</b> <b>beds,</b> fibres and thick membranes.
