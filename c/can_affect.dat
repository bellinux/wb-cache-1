50|$|Human {{society and}} forests {{influence}} {{each other in}} {{both positive and negative}} ways. Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions. Forests <b>can</b> also <b>affect</b> people's health. Human activities, including harvesting forest resources, <b>can</b> negatively <b>affect</b> forest ecosystems.|$|R
5|$|Individuals with Asperger {{syndrome}} {{may have}} signs or symptoms that {{are independent of}} the diagnosis, but <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> the individual or the family. These include differences in perception and problems with motor skills, sleep, and emotions.|$|E
5|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} {{result in}} progressive damage to {{different parts of}} the brain's function, and worsen with age. Common examples include dementia such as Alzheimer's disease, alcoholic dementia or vascular dementia; Parkinson's disease; and other rarer infectious, genetic, or metabolic causes such as Huntington's disease, motor neuron diseases, HIV dementia, syphilis-related dementia and Wilson's disease. Neurodegenerative diseases <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> {{different parts of the}} brain, and <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> movement, memory, and cognition.|$|E

5|$|The {{average age}} of {{menarche}} is approximately 12.5 years in the United States, 12.7 in Canada, 12.9 in the UK and 13.1 years in Iceland. Factors such as genetics, diet and overall health <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> timing.|$|E
5|$|The {{juice or}} liquid {{extracts}} are smeared {{on the head}} of the arrow, and inflicts the target paralysis, convulsions and/or cardiac arrest, virtually on strike due to the speed in which the extracts <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> a victim.|$|E
5|$|Another sort of {{risk that}} <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> dry cargoes, is {{absorption}} of ambient moisture. When very fine concretes and aggregates mix with water, the mud created {{at the bottom}} of the hold shifts easily and can produce a free surface effect. The only way to control these risks is by good ventilation practices and careful monitoring for the presence of water.|$|E

5|$|Cataracts <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> any {{breed of}} dog {{and is the}} same {{condition}} as seen in humans. Here {{the lens of the}} eye hardens and is characterised by cloudiness in the eye. Cataracts will blur the dog's vision and can lead to permanent blindness if left untreated. While considered mainly a hereditary disease, it can also be caused by diabetes, old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Congenital malformation, {{hereditary}} disorders, {{and acquired}} conditions <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> cerebellar structure and, consequently, cerebellar function. Unless the causative condition is reversible, {{the only possible}} treatment is to help people live with their problems. Visualization of the fetal cerebellum by ultrasound scan at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy {{can be used to}} screen for fetal neural tube defects with a sensitivity rate of up to 99%.|$|E
5|$|De-icers spray heated {{de-icing}} fluid, often {{propylene glycol}} or ethylene glycol, onto icy surfaces {{such as the}} bodies of aircraft and road surfaces. These prevent ice from forming {{on the body of}} the aircraft while on the ground. Ice makes the surface of the wings rougher, reducing the amount of lift they provide while increasing drag. The ice also increases the weight of the aircraft and <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> its balance.|$|E
50|$|Minimum {{interrupt}} latency {{is largely}} {{determined by the}} interrupt controller circuit and its configuration. They <b>can</b> also <b>affect</b> the jitter in the interrupt latency, which <b>can</b> drastically <b>affect</b> the real-time schedulability of the system. The Intel APIC Architecture {{is well known for}} producing a huge amount of interrupt latency jitter.|$|R

5|$|Econometric {{analysis}} of DSGE models suggested that real factors sometimes affect the economy. A paper by Frank Smets and Rafael Woulters (2007) stated that monetary policy explained {{only a small}} part of the fluctuations in economic output. In new synthesis models, shocks <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> both demand and supply. The new synthesis implies that monetary policy can have a stabilizing effect on the economy, contrary to new classical theory.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{pollution}}. Water {{pollution is}} primarily seen in turtles and crocodilians and <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> their eggs and sex characteristics. Male American alligators (Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi) {{have been found}} with lowered testosterone and altered gonads in a chemically contaminated lake.|$|E
5|$|Galaxies have {{magnetic}} fields of their own. They {{are strong enough}} to be dynamically important: they drive mass inflow into the centers of galaxies, they modify the formation of spiral arms and they <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> the rotation of gas in the outer regions of galaxies. Magnetic fields provide the transport of angular momentum required for the collapse of gas clouds and hence the formation of new stars.|$|E

5|$|Habitat {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.|$|E
5|$|In {{osteochondritis}} dissecans, {{fragments of}} cartilage or bone become loose within a joint, leading to pain and inflammation. These fragments are {{sometimes referred to}} as joint mice. OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself, giving rise to secondary inflammation. OCD most commonly affects the knee, although it <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> other joints such as the ankle or the elbow.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Bowling {{was one of}} {{the leaders}} in the horse genome project. This work was also {{important}} to human medicine, as there are at least 90 genetic conditions that <b>can</b> <b>affect</b> both humans and horses. The horse genome was first sequenced in 2006, and was fully mapped by 2009.|$|E
