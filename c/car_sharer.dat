40|$|So, {{you want}} to start a car sharing organization. The <b>Car</b> <b>Sharer</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Companion, {{researched}} and written by the team members of CarShare Cascadia Mobility Consultants, is your handbook and resource guide for starting a car sharing organization in Portland, Oregon. After your operation mobilizes, the Companion can continue to serve as a reference. It comes in two parts. Part I: An Ignition Guide presents the steps to start up a car sharing operation. Its four chapters cover how to build and incorporate your organization, how to find and serve a market for car sharing, what decisions to make in investment and insurance, and a what strategies to use for managing the operation. The Ignition Guide encourages you with evidence that, once knowing how, where, with whom to start an car sharing 2 ̆ 7 organization, you can develop an economically feasible, convenient, and marketable enterprise in Portland. The handbook format includes information, advice, and italicized illustrative case studies. Part II: A Resource Guide is useful for when you seek more in-depth information about the subjects discussed in Part I. It provides a subject index and an annotated bibliography to the sources that inform this handbook. Moreover, it provides a list of potential car sharers [...] the beginnings ofa network in Portland. Section I ofthe Resource Guide presents the subject-by-subject resource directory. Its subjects match the four chapters in the Ignition Guide above. For instance, after reading about the best corporate structure in section 1 - 2 of 2 ̆ 2 Chapter 1 : Mobilizing Your Organization 2 ̆ 2 in the handbook, you can turn to the section 1 - 2 of the resource directory to find an index of sources on corporate form. Section II of the Resource guide is not arranged by subject. It is an alphabetized, fully annotated source bibliography. Sources include a variety of interviews, meetings, correspondences, and also annotated literature entries that support our findings. Finally, we have provided a glossary ofthe key car sharing concepts that drive the mobility sharing movement. Read these on the following page to prime yourself for your journey into the wonderful world of car sharing. And believe us, it is truly a beautiful place. So turn that page and twist that ignition key. Let 2 ̆ 7 s hit the road...|$|E
40|$|Car sharing is an {{emerging}} transportation industry in which drivers access {{a fleet of}} shared vehicles for short-term use. Car sharing programs have demonstrated success in reducing private car ownership and kilometres travelled by private car and shared vehicle use is increasingly positioned as {{a useful tool for}} cities seeking to transition away from private car dependency. For a number of reasons, car sharing's success is dependent on the provision of fixed and reserved car parking space. Allocated parking space works to provide consistency and reliability in the location of the act of transfer where the car is conferred from one user to the next. The reservation of parking space for the car share car delineates the structure of a car sharing network and determines its ability to offer a service to <b>car</b> <b>sharers.</b> Furthermore, the allocation of space sends a strong message of regulatory support for a sustainable transport mode, relieving car sharing organisations of the need to invest in parking, and contributing to the financial viability of the car sharing business, particularly in the start-up phase. This paper first presents a review of car parking policy for car sharing in Sydney, Australia. We show how parking for car sharing is governed at the scale of the municipality and detail the emergence of several different approaches to the provision of car sharing parking, with parking-related policy used to both restrict and encourage the use of shared cars. We then position these policies within the findings of a series of in depth interviews carried out with Sydney <b>car</b> <b>sharers</b> who recount their practical experiences of the way car parking makes car sharing work. The ability to park a car close to home is identified as a key motivator for the uptake of car sharing in areas where on street parking is constrained and private off street parking unavailable. Non-car sharing cars parking illegally in designated car sharing parking space is consistently cited as a key complaint, with <b>car</b> <b>sharer's</b> indicating that a lack of parking enforcement detracts considerably from car sharing's appeal. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations for policy, and implications for emergent car sharing models. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a range of tests of organised car sharing schemes. The performance of the schemes is predicted using a sophisticated microsimulation model. A brief resume of the model is followed by a description of the tests and an analysis of their results. Conclusions are drawn on the place of organised car sharing within broader transport policies, the performance of the model when compared to the available empirical data and directions for public research. The tests here presented include: a series of sensitivity analyses; tests of organisational strategies for car sharing schemes; tests of schemes in a variety of locations and at a variety of scales and finally a batch of tests which investigate the effect of major changes in the operating environment of car sharing schemes - changes in the price of fuel and public transport fares and the provision of parking space incentives for <b>car</b> <b>sharers</b> for example...|$|R
40|$|The product, or {{hardware}} if you will, still lies at {{the heart}} of the production and consumption chain, resulting in a significant environmental impact. Basing design on applied value instead of the product itself can offer substantial ecological advantages. Ir. Rens Meijkamp tested the eco-efficient service theory by examining car sharing schemes, commercial ventures which make rental cars available to their customers on a twenty-four hour seven days a week basis, thus providing an alternative to privately owned motor vehicles. The results? The potential environmental benefits of car sharing (which should not be confused with car pooling) are enormous: the environmental impact of <b>car</b> <b>sharers</b> is 40 percent less than that of the average Dutch household, at least insofar as mobility is concerned. If car sharing were to continue to develop at the current rate, the total environmental impact resulting from mobility could be reduced by 30 percent in the year 2010. Even so, it remains to be seen whether that will be enough to create a sustainable society...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) are a core {{element of}} the European Commission's Urban Mobility Package. A bundle of {{measures}} combines infrastructure; clean fuels and vehicles; and soft measures to promote walking, cycling and public transport use. Looking at the problems of cities world-wide, one crucial aspect not (yet) adequately addressed is increasing car-ownership, leading to over-consumption of space in cities creating both congestion and parking problems. The City of Bremen's SUMP, which received the 2014 CIVITAS Award and the 2015 SUMP Award, integrates car sharing as a strategic element to reduce car ownership. The ambitious Car Sharing Action Plan from 2009, the first municipal thematic plan on car sharing, set a target of 20, 000 car sharing users by 2020 and, more important, the replacement of about 6, 000 private cars through the service of car sharing. Annual user surveys in Bremen show that every car sharing car takes 15 private cars off the road. This figure includes only <b>cars</b> that <b>car</b> <b>sharers</b> report giving up after becoming <b>car</b> <b>sharers</b> and does not include car purchases that were avoided by users who may have bought a car if no option had been available. Station-based car sharing, with its wide variety of vehicles and the reliability of pre-reservation (but also the option of spontaneous bookings) has a much higher impact on car ownership than does free-floating car sharing. In its 2010 ‘momorandum’, the European IEE project momo Car Sharing estimated that European cities could be unburdened of the parking needs of 600, 000 cars – end-to-end a row from London to Athens – if other cities applied policies {{similar to those in}} Bremen (and also Switzerland). The potential is huge to improve traffic, the environment and quality of life in European cities. This practitioner's report presents municipal policies and activities undertaken in Bremen (1) to exploit the potential of car sharing (e. g. providing mobility hubs and on-street car sharing stations; integration in new urban developments; multi-modal integration; optimising fleet management, information and awareness), (2) to develop quality requirements and (3) to prepare for future developments (e. g. autonomous transport systems). It also clarifies the different roles of station-based and free-floating car sharing and their potential for different types of cities and towns. The presentation will show – {{from the perspective of a}} municipality – how car sharing can be integrated into both advanced sustainable urban mobility planning and into more efficient urban developments. New urban developments with integrated car sharing, bike sharing and high quality public transport do not need as many car parking spaces as conventional developments, creating potential for reducing costs and improving the quality of urban space...|$|R
5000|$|A {{friend of}} Loveless', Crystal Wathen, {{came over to}} Loveless' house, and they told her what had happened. Then, the three girls drove to pick up Heavrin and bring her back to Loveless' house, where they told Heavrin the story; {{although}} she did not believe it was true, Heavrin comforted the hysterical Loveless. [...] Both Heavrin and Wathen became convinced when Tackett showed them {{the trunk of the}} <b>car</b> with <b>Sharer's</b> bloody handprints and socks still present. Heavrin was horrified and asked to be taken home. When they {{pulled up in front of}} her house, Loveless kissed Heavrin and told her she loved her and pleaded her not to tell anyone. Heavrin promised she would not before entering her house.|$|R
50|$|At Witch's Castle, {{they took}} a sobbing Sharer in and bound {{her arms and legs}} with rope. There, Loveless taunted that she had pretty hair and {{wondered}} how pretty she would look if they were to cut it off, which frightened Sharer even more. Loveless began taking off Sharer's rings and handed each to the girls. At some point, Rippey had taken Sharer's Mickey Mouse watch and danced to the tune it played. Tackett further taunted Sharer, claiming that Witch's Castle was filled with human remains and Sharer's would be next. To further threaten Sharer, Tackett then retrieved from the car a shirt with a smiley design and lit it on fire, but immediately feared that the fire would be spotted by passing cars, so the girls left with <b>Sharer.</b> During the <b>car</b> ride, <b>Sharer</b> continued begging them to take her back home. Loveless ordered Sharer to slip off her bra, which she then handed over to Rippey, who slid off her own bra and replaced it with Sharer's while steering the car. They became lost, so they stopped for directions at a gas station, where they covered Sharer in a blanket. While Tackett went inside to ask for directions, Lawrence called a boy she knew in Louisville and chatted for several minutes to ease her worries, but did not mention Sharer's abduction. They returned to the car but became lost again and pulled up to another gas station. There, Lawrence and Rippey spotted a couple of boys and talked to them before once again getting back into the car and leaving, arriving some time later at the edge of some woods near Tackett's home in Madison, Indiana.|$|R
