The bashplate was dual purpose: to stop dirt {{entering}} the air filter, and also to protect the carburettor from damage. Even later models (by frame number TB1029) were fitted with a further small light steel plate shielding the <b>carburettor</b> <b>float</b> bowl and fitted under {{the heads of the}} front two engine mounting bolts.|$|E

50|$|A {{group of}} men, {{including}} Samuel Henshaw, then {{the chairman of}} the Staffordshire Chemical Company, reckoned there was money to be made from these surplus-to-requirements stocks. Henshaw became the first chairman of the National Benzole Company. Although the idea of using benzole to power automobiles was not new, cars fueled on neat benzole needed altered carburetter settings which was inconvenient for owners who had previously used petrol and the effectiveness of neat benzole as a paint stripper raised concern about the possible effect on <b>carburettor</b> <b>floats</b> made of varnished cork - a common feature in US vehicles which at the time were being imported in greater numbers. There was also concern about the variable quality and specification of the benzole. It was in the need to address these concerns, especially regarding consistency of fuel quality, that Henshaw and his colleagues recognized their commercial opportunity.|$|R
500|$|The use of {{carburettors}} {{was calculated}} {{to give a}} higher specific power output, due to the lower temperature, hence greater density, of the fuel/air mixture compared to injected systems. However, the Merlin's <b>float</b> controlled <b>carburettor</b> meant that both Spitfires and Hurricanes were unable to pitch nose down into a steep dive. The contemporary Bf 109E, which had direct fuel injection, could [...] "bunt" [...] into a high-power dive to escape attack, leaving the pursuing aircraft behind because its fuel had been {{forced out of the}} <b>carburettor's</b> <b>float</b> chamber by the effects of negative g-force (g). RAF fighter pilots soon learned to [...] "half-roll" [...] their aircraft before diving to pursue their opponents. [...] "Miss Shilling's orifice", a restrictor in the fuel supply line to restrict flow together with a diaphragm fitted in the float chamber to contain fuel under negative G, went some way towards curing the fuel starvation in a dive; however, at less than maximum power a fuel-rich mixture still resulted. Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet {{from the bottom of the}} S.U. carburettor to exactly halfway up the side, which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g.|$|R
5000|$|In 1902, Ariel {{produced}} {{its first}} motorcycle, {{which had a}} Kerry engine with an innovative magneto ignition and a <b>float</b> <b>carburettor.</b> That year, Ariel {{was taken over by}} Components Ltd., owned by Charles Sangster. Sangster built a three-speed, two-stroke motorcycle that was sold as the [...] "Arielette", but he stopped production on the outbreak of the First World War.|$|R
5|$|The only {{abnormality}} {{found in}} all four engines was the vapour vent float in the fuel strainer chamber of the <b>carburettors.</b> The <b>floats</b> had been crushed by extreme fuel pressure. Inquiries {{were made to the}} engine manufacturer and other civil aviation authorities but none had prior experience of vapour vent floats collapsing. Tests on carburettors were also carried out in Australia by the Aeronautical Research Laboratories but without finding any suitable explanation. Whether the floats were crushed in flight or in the crash could not be determined, but even if it had occurred in flight it would not have affected operation of the engines.|$|R
40|$|Small {{off-road}} engines (SORE) {{have been}} recognised {{as a major}} source of air pollution. It is estimated that non handheld SORE annually produce over 1 million tonnes of HC+NOx and over 50 million tonnes of CO 2. The fuel system design and its operating AFR are of key importance with regard to engine operation and engine out emissions. The conventional low-cost <b>float</b> <b>carburettors</b> used in these engines are relatively ineffective at atomising and preparing the fuel for combustion requiring a rich setting for acceptable functional performance. EPA and CARB have confirmed that Phase 3 limits are achievable for a “durable ” engine fitted with a conventional well calibrated and manufactured “stock rich setting ” <b>float</b> <b>carburettor</b> together with catalytic oxidation after-treatment and passive secondary air injection. The EPA and CARB strategy for meeting Phase 3 only considers the use of conventional <b>float</b> <b>carburettors</b> that operate at rich AFR’s over their entire engine operating range as no other cost effective alternative fuel system is yet available on the market. A cost effective alternative to the conventional carburettor that enabled leaner or optimised AFR operation with load and improved combustion performance would open the door to alternative strategies to meeting the phase 3 limits. This paper presents a completely new form of mechanical carburettor that gives AFR control with load, improved mixture preparation for improved combustion performance and has a lower production cost than conventional carburettors. The conventional and new fuel system designs and operation are discussed in detail and their technical merits demonstrated in the form of engine test data. The performance of different after-treatment systems is also simulated for different AF...|$|R
50|$|Negative G engine cut-out was not {{a problem}} unique to Merlin-powered fighters since many other pre-war {{aeroplanes}} also used <b>carburettors</b> containing a <b>float</b> chamber. For example, in 1942, the United States acquired a flyable, Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero, known as the Akutan Zero. When test-flown, this aircraft was also found to experience engine cut-outs, due to the float-type carburettor of its Nakajima Sakae engine. The Americans devised tactics to counter the Zero in combat that took advantage of this and other results of testing the aircraft.|$|R

50|$|From 1968 the Thunderbolt {{benefited from}} a number of minor {{improvements}} including a longer kick start to make starting easier and metal tank badges to replace the earlier plastic ones, which had a tendency to crack. An Amal Concentric <b>Float</b> <b>carburettor</b> dealt with the problems of fuel flooding experienced with the earlier monobloc carburettor, by having the float bowl arranged centrally around (concentric with, hence the name) the main jet to remove the sensitivity to fuel surge inherent in all the earlier designs. Stiffer suspension improved cornering but poor quality control and production problems on the BSA assembly line with later models led to oil leaks and rusting parts which damaged the reputation of the Thunderbolt, which was already struggling to compete against the emerging Japanese motorcycles of the early 1970s (such as the Honda CB750) and production ended in 1972.|$|R
5000|$|The D-400 series engine or the Iron Horse {{engine was}} a {{light-duty}} two-stroke engine used for powering lawnmowers {{produced in the}} 1960s to the early 1980s. D-400 engines were single-cylinder engines designed and manufactured by the Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC; Johnson and Evinrude) for Lawn-Boy and Masport. The D-400 engines displaced 109 cc, generated 2.61 kW of power, and operated {{in the range of}} 2400-3300 RPM. The engines have a distinctive rectangular cowling that has created a nickname of Brick-top mowers. Another distinctive feature is the two-finger vertical recoil starter. The kidney-shaped muffler and exhaust unit is mounted beneath the mowers' deck and gives the engine a small, low profile design when compared to the newer and more powerful lawnmower engines. The ignition system employs a magneto, points, and a condenser (capacitor) set-up with an unusual spark-advance system which utilised a weight on the crankshaft to adjust the spark-advance amount depending on engine speed. The sprung governor was also unusual with a throw-yoke which operated under the flywheel and was linked to the throttle. The <b>carburettor</b> was a <b>float</b> design and fed into a pair of reed valves.|$|R
50|$|A {{second problem}} with the {{conventional}} carburettor was its good performance in steady conditions, but poor progression: its dynamic ability to respond, such as when suddenly opening the throttle. This could give 'flat spots' in performance, or required great additional complexity to the carburettor such as multiple chokes, emulsion tubes and accelerator pumps. The Fish carburettor metered its fuel flow through a calibrated tapered groove, connected directly to the accelerator pedal and the throttle butterfly. The fuel metering orifice was controlled in immediate proportion to the throttle position, {{in a similar manner}} to the motorcycle slide <b>carburettor.</b> Between the <b>float</b> chamber and the venturi, an additional chamber, unique to the Fish design, contains the metering arm and groove. The arm is attached to the throttle spindle, moves with it, and is drilled with a hollow channel supplying fuel to the jets on the throttle spindle. This arm has an inlet hole at its end, which is a simple drilling and not of precise size. The hole passes over the metering groove, which is a radial arc in one wall of the chamber and it is the width of this groove which is precisely controlled, so as to accurately meter the fuel. As the throttle arm moves to the wide-throttle position, the arm sweeps across to the wider part of the groove, allowing more fuel to flow. The arm is close-fitting within the width of the chamber. As it moves, this close fit has the effect of a vane pump and acts as an accelerator pump to force additional fuel into the jet when the throttle is first opened.|$|R
