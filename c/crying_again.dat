(15 July)This evening I was standing outside the door with baby in my arms, talking to the ayah, when I felt something whiz past my ears. (23 July)A poor woman [...] [...] [...] whose husband [...] [...] [...] had been killed during the siege, came to-day {{to ask me to}} give her a little milk for her only child, who was dying for the want of proper nourishment. It went to my heart to refuse her; but at this time I had only just enough for my own children, and baby could not have lived without it. I think she understood that I would have given her some if I could. (14 August)The children still kept pretty well, though baby grew thinner every day; nothing I gave him seemed to nourish him. (28 August)As we were starting, Major Ouvry brought us some beer to drink, and poor baby, who was very thirsty, cried louder for it than I had ever heard him before. With difficulty I pacified him, and succeeded in getting him to sleep. Just then the word 'Halt!' was heard, and silence was ordered, all lights to be put out. It was evident some danger was apprehended, and I shall never forget my anxiety lest baby should commence <b>crying</b> <b>again,</b> and perhaps betray our whereabouts; I hardly dared breathe.

60|$|They made {{me laugh}} again by {{laughing}} at each other, and then we all three laughed until I {{was in danger of}} <b>crying</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|But {{the little}} ragged figure only began to <b>cry</b> <b>again,</b> harder than ever.|$|R
60|$|She became quiet--and {{then started}} to <b>cry</b> <b>again,</b> into her apron. Aaron waited. He felt {{physically}} weak.|$|R
60|$|There came no reply, and he <b>cried</b> <b>again.</b> Then {{he pulled}} out his pistol and fired a shot.|$|R
60|$|The {{door slammed}} violently, and Saxon, ere she fell to <b>crying</b> <b>again,</b> {{could hear her}} {{sister-in-law}} lumbering about the kitchen and talking loudly to herself.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nonsense, nurse,' said Gillian. 'I'm {{much better}} pleased {{to go and}} be of some use! Val, you naughty child, how dare you make such a fuss?' for Valetta was <b>crying</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{and tell}} her I think of her all the time, and worship her. Why--you are <b>crying</b> <b>again.</b> Don't be so worried about me, dear; I think {{there is nothing to}} fear, yet." ...|$|E
60|$|They <b>cried</b> <b>again</b> {{to their}} comrades in the distance, and the rough answer came back faint and mellowed.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Well, Ernest?' Edie <b>cried</b> <b>again,</b> {{feeling pretty}} certain {{in her own}} heart what was coming next, and {{reddening}} accordingly.|$|R
60|$|He {{saw that}} she was <b>crying</b> <b>again.</b> He remembered how she had come to him when Emil Miller had deserted her and how she had wept. The {{recollection}} of her suffering and of his own humiliation seemed to render more overwhelming the compassion he felt now.|$|E
60|$|Poor Mary, Ethel {{felt as if}} she had {{neglected}} her! She found her hanging over the nursery fire, alternating with old nurse in fond reminiscences of Harry's old days, sometimes almost laughing at his pranks, then <b>crying</b> <b>again,</b> while Aubrey sat between them, drinking in each word.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So you are governess {{as well as}} ladies'-maid, are you, Lily? What else? Housekeeper, I suppose, as I see {{you have}} all the weekly bills on your desk. Why, Lily, this is {{perfectly}} philanthropic of you. You are exemplifying the rule of love in a majestic manner. <b>Crying</b> <b>again!</b> Water lily once more?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Kramer, seeing Elaine dancing, quickly informs {{her that}} [...] "she stinks." [...] Jerry reluctantly {{confirms}} this, but Elaine {{is still not}} convinced. She videotapes herself over {{the ending of the}} bootleg copy of <b>Cry,</b> <b>Cry</b> <b>Again.</b> When Brody comes to pick up the <b>Cry,</b> <b>Cry</b> <b>Again</b> bootleg that Jerry was going to shoot, Jerry and Kramer are forced to give him the bad copy Kramer recorded, which Elaine has recorded her dancing over.|$|R
60|$|She <b>cried</b> <b>again</b> {{that their}} youth was senile and cruel {{on the day}} when she overheard Cy Bogart and Earl Haydock.|$|R
5000|$|... (if {{you throw}} little money you will <b>cry</b> <b>again</b> and again, {{but if you}} throw big money you will cry only once).|$|R
6000|$|Instead {{of helping}} me up, {{the poor thing}} stole her hand into mine, {{and gave it a}} little squeeze. She tried hard to keep from <b>crying</b> <b>again,</b> and succeeded--for which I {{respected}} her. [...] "You're very kind, Mr. Betteredge," [...] she said. [...] "I don't want any dinner to-day--let me bide a little longer here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't ask {{me about}} my relations!" [...] she broke out. [...] "I daren't think {{of the dead and}} gone, in the trouble that is trying me now. If I speak of the old times at home, I shall only burst out <b>crying</b> <b>again,</b> and {{distress}} you. Talk of something else, sir--talk of something else." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Allen {{looked down}} the hall but saw nothing, for Jean had slammed the door just in time. Half an hour later when they were going down to breakfast Miss Allen came along the hall with outstretched hands to meet them. She had been <b>crying</b> <b>again,</b> but I think her tears were happy ones; and she was smiling now. A cluster of Jean's roses were pinned on her breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "He means Castlewood. These are his vines," [...] George <b>cries</b> <b>again,</b> {{shaking his}} fist at the creepers sunning {{themselves}} on the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, mother, mother!" [...] I <b>cried</b> <b>again,</b> {{thinking}} {{perhaps by}} that all-powerful word {{to move her}} yet to pity and to gentleness.|$|R
60|$|Lady Kelsey {{began to}} <b>cry</b> <b>again,</b> and Mrs. Crowley sat in silence, {{not knowing what}} to say. George walked about in agitation.|$|R
6000|$|He found Elizabeth in the school-room, all {{flushed and}} tear-stained in the face; {{and he told}} her affectionately how much pleased he was with her {{patience}} under this false accusation. Delight very nearly set her off <b>crying</b> <b>again,</b> but she managed to say, [...] "It was Miss Fosbrook and Sam and Susie that made me patient, Papa; they were so kind. And nobody would have believed it, if I wasn't always cross, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|Grisell {{might have}} begun <b>crying</b> <b>again</b> at finding herself alone, but the sweet {{chanting}} lulled her, and she {{lay back on}} her pillows, half dozing but quite content, except that the wound on her neck felt stiff and dry; and by and by when the chanting ceased, the kind nun, with a lay sister, came back again carrying water and other appliances, at sight of which Grisell shuddered, for Master Miles never touched her without putting her to pain.|$|E
6000|$|But the [...] "Little Nassau," [...] {{beginning}} to cool, had started on its long descent, {{and ran into}} counter currents which bobbed it roughly about. This swung the boy around pretty lively, smashing him into the bag once quite severely. His lip began to tremble at this, and he was <b>crying</b> <b>again.</b> I tried to joke and laugh, {{but it was no}} use. His pluck was oozing out, and at any moment I was prepared to see him go shooting past me.|$|E
60|$|At {{that she}} began to <b>cry</b> <b>again,</b> and told the king's son all that had befallen her {{since the death of}} her mother.|$|R

6000|$|... "'Aurora!' he <b>cried</b> <b>again,</b> {{and with}} that enigmatic word on his lips was incinerated in the vast and towering belch of the devouring element.|$|R
60|$|I {{reached the}} inn without meeting Sir Percival, and without noticing {{anything}} more, {{and was glad}} {{to find that the}} landlady had received Fanny with all possible kindness. The girl had a little parlour to sit in, away from the noise of the taproom, and a clean bedchamber {{at the top of the}} house. She began <b>crying</b> <b>again</b> at the sight of me, and said, poor soul, truly enough, that it was dreadful to feel herself turned out into the world as if she had committed some unpardonable fault, when no blame could be laid at her door by anybody--not even by her master, who had sent her away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where," [...] demanded Punch, wearied of a loathsome {{contrivance}} on {{four wheels}} with {{a mound of}} luggage atop--"where is our broom-gharri? This thing talks so much that I can't talk. Where is our own broom-gharri? When I was at Bandstand before we comed away, I asked Inverarity Sahib why {{he was sitting in}} it, and he said it was his own. And I said, 'I will give it you'--I like Inverarity Sahib--and I said, 'Can you put your legs through the pully-wag loops by the windows? And Inverarity Sahib said No, and laughed. I can put my legs through the pully-wag loops. I can put my legs through these pully-wag loops. Look! Oh, Mamma's <b>crying</b> <b>again!</b> I did n't know. I was n't not to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|Armine {{knew there}} was no chance of an {{immediate}} and entire recovery for him, and this was a severe stroke to Babie, who was quite unprepared. And, as her face began to draw up with tears near the surface, he hugged her close, and consolingly whispered that now they would be together always, he should not have to go away from his own dear Babie Bunting, and there was a little kissing match, ending by Babie saying, disconsolately, [...] "But you did like Eton so, and {{you were going to get}} the Newcastle and the Prince Consort's prize, and to be in the eleven and all—-and you were so sure of a high remove! Oh, dear!" [...] and she let her head drop on his shoulder, and was almost <b>crying</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
