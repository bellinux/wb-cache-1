40|$|Benzoyl peroxide, a {{powerful}} organic oxidizing agent, was applied topically {{according to a}} carefully developed technique to cutaneous ulcers of different types. The healing time was shortened greatly by the rapid development of healthy granulation tissue and the quick ingrowth of epithelium. Exceptionally large pressure ulcers with deep cavities, undercut edges and sinus tracts were sucessfully treated, as were stasis ulcers of long duration resistant to all other therapy. There were only 13 treatment failures among the 133 cases. The slow, sustained release of oxygen by benzoyl peroxide was though {{to be responsible for}} the success. The only complications were <b>contact</b> irritant <b>dermatitis</b> in 3 % and <b>contact</b> allergic <b>dermatitis</b> in 2 % of patients treated...|$|R

40|$|Allergic {{reactions}} to natural rubber latex proteins among glove using {{health care professionals}} has become a significant problem worldwide {{over the last few}} decades. However, in Sri Lanka a statistical study has never been carried out to detect allergic responses to latex proteins. The current study was undertaken in order to fill this void. The study consisted of a questionnaire based survey and determination of extractable protein content of different glove brands used by Sri Lankan health care workers. Project sites were selected which represents an island wide cross section of Sri Lankan healthcare workers including all bio-climatic zones of Sri Lanka. An introductory leaflet and two questionnaires were prepared and distributed among 6, 000 health care workers of following hospitals; Colombo south (Pilot sample), the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (bulk sample), Karapitiya, Mahamodara, Kandy, Anuradhpura, Ratnepura, Kurunegela, Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Hambanthota, Tissamaharamaya and Tangalle hospitals. Total extractable proteins of new and re-used glove samples were determined by using BCA protein assay test kit. Results of this study provide information on Latex Allergy (LA) and <b>Contact</b> Glove <b>Dermatitis</b> (CGD) among Sri Lankan health care workers for the first time. Results of the questionnaire survey were analyzed. Response rate of the entire population was 59 %. Out of 3, 526 respondents, 14 % reported adverse {{reactions to}} latex gloves. The prevalence of <b>Contact</b> Glove <b>Dermatitis</b> was 13 % and 5 % met the criteria for Latex Allergy. Combination of LA and CGD was detected only in 4. 22 %. The prevalence of latex allergy and <b>Contact</b> glove <b>dermatitis</b> in this study were comparatively low when compared to the previous studies among other countries. Statistical analysis of collected data was done by using the SAS package. According to the statistical analysis of results from this study, factors such as gender (females), longer duration of glove use on daily basis (more than 6 hours and 1 - 6 hours per day), different sections of hospital, presence of wheezing/asthma, hay fever, food allergy, drug allergy, eczema, soap allergy, dust allergy and allergy to sun rays appear to be contributing (risk) factors of developing Latex Allergy and <b>Contact</b> Glove <b>Dermatitis</b> in health care workers. Health care workers who use gloves frequently appear to be at risk of developing <b>Contact</b> Glove <b>Dermatitis.</b> There is relationship between job category (occupation) of health care workers and <b>Contact</b> Glove <b>Dermatitis.</b> Total extractable protein levels of different glove brands were higher than the. levels, which FDA has proposed. However, it is necessary to confirm the prevalence of latex allergy in this study, by doing an evaluation test, which is a measure of IgE mediated hypersensitivity such as skin test or ill-vitro assay of specific IgE antibodies to the latex allergens...|$|R

5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis.</b> Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, and most have been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus is {{a species}} of fungus in the Suillaceae family of mushrooms. Commonly known as the chicken fat mushroom, the American {{slippery}} Jack (or slipperycap), or the American suillus, it grows in a mycorrhizal association with eastern white pine {{and can be found}} where this tree occurs in eastern North America and China. The mushroom can be recognized by the bright yellow cap with red to reddish-brown scales embedded in slime, the large yellow angular pores {{on the underside of the}} cap, and the narrow yellow stem marked with dark reddish dots. Molecular phylogenetics analysis suggests that S.americanus may be the same species as S.sibiricus, found in western North America and western and central Asia. Suillus americanus is edible, although opinions vary as to its palatability; some susceptible individuals may suffer a <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis</b> after touching the fruit bodies. The fruit bodies contain a beta glucan carbohydrate shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E

25|$|Dermatitis is a {{group of}} skin {{conditions}} that includes atopic dermatitis, allergic <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> irritant <b>contact</b> <b>dermatitis,</b> and stasis dermatitis. The exact cause of dermatitis is often unclear. Cases are believed to often involve a combination of irritation, allergy, and poor venous return. The type of dermatitis is generally determined by the person's history and the location of the rash. For example, irritant dermatitis often occurs on the hands of people who frequently get them wet.

50|$|Within the workplace, {{individuals}} may {{be exposed to}} significant amounts of nickel, airborne from the combustion of fossil fuels, or from contact with tools that are nickel-plated. Historically, workplaces where prolonged contact with soluble nickel has been high, have shown high risks for allergic <b>contact</b> nickel <b>dermatitis.</b> For example, nickel dermatitis was common in the past among nickel platers. Due to improved industrial and personal hygiene practices, however, {{over the past several}} decades, reports of nickel sensitivity in workplaces, such as the electroplating industry, have been sparse.

40|$|Background and objectivesMatrix Metaloproteinases (MMPs), {{produced}} {{mainly by}} fibroblasts, {{play a major}} role in wound healing processes. This study aimed to investigate the MMP 2 activity in dermal fibroblasts found in chronic <b>contact</b> nickel <b>dermatitis</b> lesions. MethodsIn order to study the role of MMP 2 in <b>contact</b> nickel <b>dermatitis,</b> fibroblast from patients and healthy individuals were cultured based on ex-plantation of skin. MMP 2 activity was measured in fibroblast culture media using zymoanalysis. Zymograms were then analyzed by quantitative densitometry. MTT assay was also used to evaluate and compare proliferation capacity of fibroblasts in both cell cultures. ResultsThe mean MMP 2 activity 6 - 8 days after ex-plantation was significantly higher in patients fibroblasts than in normal individuals(170 ï± 9. 2 and 134. 3 ï± 5. 9 in patients and normals, respectively (p< 0. 05)). The proliferation capacity of patients' fibroblasts was significantly higher than that of normal cases (385938 ï± 2816 and 270261 ï± 6527 respectively, p< 0. 05) in the same days. ConclusionOur study shows a significant increase in degenerative activity of fibroblasts in nickel dermatitis lesions. It was also seen that the MMP 2 activity per cell was significantly higher in patients' fibroblasts compared to healthy individuals and that gelatinolytic activity of MMP 2 is independent of cell number. Therefore, intra- and inter-cellular signals may be altered in fibroblasts of nickel dermatitis lesions which lead to promotion of fibroblast response to mitogenic and fibrogenic stimulations.
