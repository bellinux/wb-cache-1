Eurocode 2 provides guidance {{on the design}} of <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in reinforced concrete elements with base (edge) and end restraint, but not combined base and end restraint, which commonly occurs. The paper describes an experimental programme, which was conducted to investigate early-age {{and long-term}} shrinkage cracking in reinforced concrete walls with combined base and end restraint. The main variables in the test programme were concrete cover and reinforcement ratio. Early-age cracking is simulated with non-linear finite-element analysis, which is shown to capture the observed behaviour adequately. Eurocode 2 gives reasonable estimates of long-term crack widths in the tested walls if edge restraint is assumed, but significantly overestimates crack widths if the worst case of end restraint is assumed...|$|E
40|$|The shear {{capacity}} of reinforced concrete pier caps in existing bridge support {{systems can be}} a factor which limits the {{capacity of}} an existing bridge. In their usual configuration, pier caps behave as deep beams and {{have the ability to}} carry load through tied arch action after the formation of diagonal cracks. Externally bonded fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement has been shown to increase the shear capacity of reinforced concrete members which carry load through beam action. However, there is an insufficient amount of research to make it a viable strengthening system for beams which carry load through arch action, such as pier caps. Accordingly, this research was aimed at investigating the behavior of reinforced concrete pier caps through a coordinated experimental and analytical program and to recommend an external strengthening method for pier caps with perceived deficiencies in shear strength. The experimental study was performed on laboratory specimens based on an existing bridge in Georgia. A number of factors were examined, including size, percentage longitudinal reinforcement and <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> <b>reinforcement.</b> The results showed that increasing the longitudinal tension reinforcement increased the beam capacity by changing the shape of the tied arch. In contrast, the presence of <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> <b>reinforcement</b> did not change the point at which diagonal cracking occurred, but it did increase the ultimate capacity by reinforcing the concrete against splitting. The results of the experimental study were used in conjunction with a larger database to examine different analytical methods for estimating the ultimate capacity of deep beams, and a new method was developed for the design of external strengthening. Two specimens were tested with externally bonded FRP reinforcement applied longitudinally to increase the strength of the tension tie. The test results correlated well with the proposed method of analysis and showed that increasing the strength of the longitudinal tension tie is an effective way to increase the strength of a reinforced concrete deep beam.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{investigates the}} {{laboratory}} test results of 12 deep beams {{available in the}} literature, where the longitudinal reinforcement was anchored into the support using short straight bar anchorages. Four different specimen groups with three different shear span-to-depth ratios (a/d) were selected {{and most of the}} deep beams failed by strut crushing after yielding of the main longitudinal reinforcement. In order to investigate the behavior of the selected deep beams, an enhanced strut-and-tie model assuming geometrical adaptability (possibility of update in the dimensions of the struts and ties as the main tie starts to yield) is proposed. The analytical results obtained using this approach may be considered as much as accurate than some conducted complex nonlinear analysis considering smeared fixed cracking model and bond-slip behavior. However, an improvement on the effective strength factor of bottle-shaped struts by means of an iterative strut-and-tie model is needed, once the effective strength factor prescribed by NBR 6118 (2014) has shown to be over conservative for all ranges of span-to-depth ratio (a/d) investigated. Finally, the obtained results indicated that short bar anchorages did not seem to influence significantly the shear strength of the deep beams investigated, especially the strength of bottled-shaped struts when appropriate <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is present...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction ScienceKimberly W. KramerStrut-and-Tie {{models are}} useful in {{designing}} reinforced concrete structures with discontinuity regions where linear stress distribution is not valid. Deep beams are typically short girders with a large point load or multiple point loads. These point loads, {{in conjunction with the}} depth and length of the members, contribute to a member with primarily discontinuity regions. ACI 318 - 08 Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete provides a method for designing deep beams using either Strut-and-Tie models (STM) or Deep Beam Method (DBM). This report compares dimension requirements, concrete quantities, steel quantities, and constructability of the two methods through the design of three different deep beams. The three designs consider the same single span deep beam with varying height and loading patterns. The first design is a single span deep beam with a large point load at the center girder. The second design is the deep beam with the same large point load at a quarter point of the girder. The last design is the deep beam with half the load at the midpoint and the other half at the quarter point. These three designs allow consideration of different shear and STM model geometry and design considerations. Comparing the two different designs shows the shear or <b>cracking</b> <b>control</b> <b>reinforcement</b> reduces by an average 13 % because the STM considers the extra shear capacity through arching action. The tension steel used for either flexure or the tension tie increases by an average of 16 % from deep beam in STM design. This is due to STM taking shear force through tension in the tension reinforcement through arching action. The main advantage of the STM is the ability to decreased member depth without decreasing shear reinforcement spacing. If the member depth is not a concern in the design, the preferred method is DBM unless the designer is familiar with STMs due to the similarity of deep beam and regular beam design theory...|$|R

40|$|Following casting, {{concrete}} cracks if early-age thermal (EAT) {{and long-term}} (LT) shrinkage movement is restrained. Crack control {{is of particular}} importance in walls which rely solely on concrete for water tightness, such as retaining walls and water resisting tanks. It is well established that the cracking behaviour of end restrained members {{is very different from}} that of edge restrained walls. For this reason, both restraint types are considered separately in literature and in codes of practice such as Eurocode 2 (EN 1992). In reality, combined edge and end restraint is present in many reinforced concrete (RC) structures. In the absence of design recommendations for combined restraint, U. K. engineers commonly design <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> <b>reinforcement</b> for end restraint as it is the worst case. In the authors’ opinion, this is wasteful as it leads to the provision of unnecessary reinforcement. To this end, an experimental programme was conducted to investigate cracking in RC walls with combined base and end restraint. The measured and calculated crack widths are compared with the predictions of EN 1992 for edge and end restraint. The results suggest that crack widths in walls with combined edge and end restraint can be calculated with the EN 1992 equations for cracking in edge restrained walls...|$|E

Three concrete beam types were produced, plain, steel reinforced and fibre reinforced, and a comparative study was undertaken of post crack flexural toughness. The procedure used was to manufacture steel A 142 fabric and macro fibre reinforced concrete beams to provide load, deflection data, toughness indices and was compliant with, ASTM C 1018 - 97, [ASTM, 1997] using a three point loading arrangement. The data was representative of what might occur in a floor slab. The findings of the paper is that A 1 42 steel fabric reinforcement as used in slabs was more effective in producing toughness and residual strength when directly compared {{to the performance of}} structural polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete.

40|$|Purpose – To {{evaluate}} manufacturers' {{claims that}} structural polypropylene fibres provide satisfactory <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> <b>reinforcement</b> {{and compare the}} findings against steel fabric used as crack control in screeds where tensile forces are likely to occur. Design/methodology/approach – The procedure used to provide load, deflection data, toughness indices and residual strength factors was compliant with ASTM C 1018 - 97 and in part ASTM C 78 - 02 to define first crack toughness and first crack strength. Findings – A 142 steel fabric reinforcement as used in screeds was more effective in producing toughness and residual strength when directly compared {{with the performance of}} structural polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete. Where polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete did have an advantage over the steel reinforced concrete was when I 20 was exceeded and the deflection and crack width was excessive. Steel fabric tended to fail and/or the screed material failed either prior to or in excess of I 20, whereas the fibre reinforced concrete held together albeit at a very much reduced load transfer when compared with steel fabric. Practical implications – If the forces to be encountered through expansion or contraction are small, then, due to the small distances between the fibres redistributing the stress and minimising the cracks within the concrete matrix, polypropylene fibres may be suitable for crack control when directly compared with A 142 fabric reinforcement. The use of fibres has benefits to the floor screed companies, using screed-laying machines as the process avoids laying steel on which the screed machine will have to operate. Originality/value – There is a general lack of research coverage examining crack control in screed floor finishing materials...|$|E

This research examines the other four beams, two without uniformly distributed <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> <b>reinforcement</b> and two with distributed horizontal and vertical reinforcement. The specimens' dimensions were 2000 mm long and 400 mm thick, with two specimens having heights of 1160 mm and the other two heights of 1840 mm. The specimens were loaded with a central loading plate 300 mm long and 400 mm wide. The end bearing plates were 250 mm long and 400 mm wide. All specimens contained seven 15 M bars forming the main tension tie reinforcement. The test results provided information on the influence of the uniformly distributed reinforcement and the crack and strain development up to failure. The ductility of the specimens containing only the main tension ties was limited due to the formation of splitting cracks along the anchorages of the main tension ties during the later stages of testing. The uniformly distributed reinforcement provided additional tension ties that increased the capacity and the ductility. Strut-and-tie models were developed to predict the capacities. The FIP Recommendations (FIP 1996) were used to determine the contributions of the two major mechanisms, direct strut action and indirect strut action. This approach gave very conservative strength predictions. More refined strut-and-tie models were developed for the specimens with uniformly distributed reinforcement. These refined models gave more accurate predictions of the capacities of the deep beams...|$|E

30|$|Concrete {{structures}} are crack-prone. This {{is particularly true}} for slabs on grade. Attempts at <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> are directed at reducing the width of each particular crack, {{in spite of the}} tradeoff of increasing the number of cracks. The durability of concrete is impaired by cracks, as they provide a path for the transportation of potentially harmful liquids and gases. Cracks of small width reduce the deterioration risk due to diminished influx of potentially damaging substances (Concrete Construction Staff 1997; The Concrete Society 2013). Narrow cracks are also preferable for aesthetic reasons. Furthermore, the mechanisms of concrete self-healing will only mend cracks of small breadth (Van Tittelboom et al. 2013). It is generally acknowledged that fibers do limit the widths of cracks caused by plastic and drying shrinkage. The higher the amount of fibers, the more effective is the crack limitation. Accordingly, to achieve uniform <b>crack</b> <b>control</b> throughout the concrete pour, the fibers should be evenly distributed. Also, irregular fiber distribution may give varying workability, e.g. pumping suitability, and affect separation tendencies.|$|R
