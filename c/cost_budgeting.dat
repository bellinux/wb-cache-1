More emphasis seems {{to be placed on}} the effects of the overall government budget on the actual general expenditure at the neglect of the effects which overhead cost budgets of MDAs have on imprest expenditures in the State. This study was therefore, carried out to fill this gap. Primary and secondary data were collected using questionnaires and office records respectively. Five hypotheses were formulated and tested by specifically applying inferential and parametric statistics to the primary data. The secondary data were specifically used to provide evidence for the identified research problem. The study revealed that overhead cost budgets, special imprests and additional imprests were ineffectively used. Secondly, even though previous studies showed that financial malpractices and poor budget monitoring were strongly associated with extra-budgetary expenditures in the 3 tiers of governments in Nigeria, the current study indicated that these two variables have little or no association and weak association respectively with extra-budgetary imprest expenditures in Cross River State MDAs. Inaccuracies in the overhead <b>cost</b> <b>budgeting</b> system were strongly associated with the extra-budgetary imprest expenditures.

For this purpose, a theoretical essay was developed in which the centralization and decentralization are discussed, addressing organizational structures, decision making and controllership. It was found that in organizations with a greater degree of centralization the accounting information system tends to be focused on the overall result of the organization, little oriented to the control of results and formed by non-financial and qualitative information. The budget tends to be used to indicate the distribution and tracking of expenditures. In organizations with a lower degree of centralization, there is a need for an information system oriented to the result of the divisions, with decentralized reports available to managers. The budget, in addition to indicating the destination of resources, must show the origin of the results, given that each divisional manager is responsible for the <b>cost</b> <b>budgeting,</b> revenues and investments of his/her division...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a {{detailed}} analysis of cost management in the context of project management and provides {{a brief description of the}} tools and techniques used in the process of cost management. The project methodology comprises use of both primary and secondary sources for research. The paper begins by identifying the importance of cost management in project management. Cost management is the process which allows companies to control and plan the costs involved in doing a business. It allows a business to predict future expenditures to help reduce the chance of going over budget. Starting a project with cost management helps avoid certain pitfalls that may be present otherwise. The purpose of cost management is to ensure sufficient supply of funds in a timely manner to the firm to meet its funding needs. It therefore becomes imperative to perform a cost benefit analysis of various alternatives before acquiring funds from any particular source. Cost Management is a key contributing factor of business success and provides a metric for measurement of performance. The study then identifies four commonly used steps for cost management - Resource Planning, Cost Estimating, <b>Cost</b> <b>Budgeting</b> and Cost Control. Resource Planning is the process of determining the actual requirements of people, equipment and materials in order to perform project activities. Cost Estimating is the process of developing an approximate estimation of the cost needed to complete the project activities. <b>Cost</b> <b>Budgeting</b> is the process of aggregating the estimated costs of individual activities or work packages establish a total cost baseline for measuring project performance. Cost Control is the process of monitoring the status of the project to update the project budget and managing changes to the cost baseline. A detailed analysis of all the four processes identifying the inputs, tools and techniques and outputs to each process is provided. The remaining part of the paper highlights the common errors and biases that plague the cost estimation process in project management such as committing to the best case scenario, using false analogies, estimation by the wrong personnel etc. The paper concludes by providing key recommendations for sound cost management and overall project management...|$|E
40|$|Cost {{estimation}} is {{an essential}} skill in the construction industry. For each stage in the project life cycle, conceptual design till decommissioning, there are particular techniques to perform cost estimation. Starting from the preliminary design stage, cost estimates progressively become more detailed and more challenging as a task that requires more man-hours. Consequently, it is not feasible to be performed repetitively. Considering this, detailed cost estimates are only performed at specific points during the design and at the bidding; leaving gaps were project cost can grow out of control. This research proposes a methodology to develop an integrated <b>cost</b> <b>budgeting</b> and cost estimation model for building projects. The proposed model is implemented by integrating an automated quantity take-off system, with a relational database to generate cost estimate reports. The dynamic environment of the proposed model, streamlines the preparation of cost estimates in order to reflect, virtually instantly, the impact of changes in project scope on the cost. Accordingly, decision makers will be able to; venture various scenarios to meet the client budget without compromising the project quality, save tremendous amount of resource-hours allocated to prepare cost estimates and cut down design process cost. The benefits of such a model can extend well beyond the doors of engineering offices to tremendously reduce the time required by contractors for preparing bidding estimates...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the importance of the}} process management in a given institution (first of all financial institution), especially in area of the risk reduction. The correct implementation of the process approach in given institution involves to take up several performances. Firstly identification of all processes in the institution, this means building the process map. Next the institution should establish for a given process: its income and outcome, the purpose and the effect (product, service) strictly connected with it, the process sources (staff, things) and finally risks identified in the process. What’s more in article author’s opinion the every process can be described as the mathematical function. Generally speaking the established process map should facilitate to run effectively the risk management. Moreover the Key Risk Indicators (KRI), which are systematically calculated, can support the objectivity of the risk assessment in the range of the risk management. Simultaneously the risk map can be also useful in order to conduct: the <b>cost</b> <b>budgeting,</b> the internal control and internal audit activity, the implementation of new IT softwares, the analysis of effectiveness and efficiency of the organizational framework and the human resources, the analysis of internal procedures etc. The few central banks in the Western Europe implemented a few ages ago the process maps. In the range of this maps, especially in the range of the identified processes, the levels of risk were estimated and reduced. As far as the National Bank of Poland (NBP) is concerned, this bank implemented in 2005 the unique 3 -level risk management system. The NBP is permanently improving this system at present. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is the {{determination}} of a minimum market price for Short-Rotation Forestry (SRF) willow biomass grown in monoculture and windbreaks in Quebec and Ontario. Full <b>cost</b> <b>budgeting</b> was used and developed on a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Harvest cycles of 3 and 4 years for monoculture plantations, and 8 years for windbreaks were investigated. Estimates for establishment and other preharvest costs were obtained from mid-sized (5 hectares) commercial SRF willow plots in Quebec and Ontario. For the monoculture plantations, irrespective of cycle length, and using the base case figures, the final delivery cost of willow biomass ranged between 74 - 126 $/odMg and 63 [...] 109 $/odMg based on current and projected costs respectively. These hold for yields between 7 and 11 odMg/ha/yr. Moreover, the 4 -year cycle was revealed to be more economically efficient than a 3 -year cycle. Along with yield, the main cost factors affecting the economics of SRF monoculture plantations are: harvesting, transportation to a processing plant, land lease management. For the two major energy markets, ethanol and electricity production (biomass in replacement of coal), SRF willow biomass in monoculture plantations {{does not appear to}} be a viable feedstock given present technology and yields. In the short run, a more promising outlet for willow biomass is space heat production for small buildings, farm complexes, etc. In this market, many potential buyers can afford to pay a higher price for biomass than ethanol or electricity utilities. In the windbreak system, biomass could be produced for between 44 and 68 $/odMg, assuming that yields between 12 to 20 odMg/ha/yr can be achieved. At this price, windbreak biomass is not a competitive feedstock for ethanol or electricity generation, but is attractive for space heat production. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|With {{the market}} {{conditions}} becoming tougher and tougher, due to more competition through {{the implementation of}} the European market, a greater sensitivity for environmental protection with its ensuing impact on planning conditions, project controlling has become more important than ever. One aim of this paper is developing an integrated system of project controlling, i. e. the integration of time planning, cost planning and capacity planning in one single system. It is based on the algorithms of critical path analysis, providing the basic components for time planning. However, to make such a system practical graphic presentations and control mechanisms are required above all. Besides, additional components for deadline and cost checks at any given time plus actual and target comparisons for the past or planning variants are needed. This paper focuses on optimising the use of production facilities. This very field is the least developed in intermediate data systems technology. One essential {{reason for this is that}} the computing procedures used so far take so much time even on large computers that they are hardly used in practice. M. Bartusch's thesis and T. Falck's paper outline a method that finds the shortest project duration/span by variations of scheduling with the number of production facilities given. This method has been adapted to computers of intermediate data systems technology. It is supplemented by an exact method providing the lowest number of production facilities by leveling with the project duration given. In addition a target function has been derived additionally smoothing the operation curve of production facilities by applying special heuristics. Wile dealing with these curves it became manifest that a certain flexibility in determining the curve is more often required rather than a minimum number of production facilities. Heuristics in connection with the assessed target function is able to cope with this demand. Maximum use of production facilities as defined by the users can be traced. Tests have demostrated the high quality of heuristic planning results, often identical with the optimum solution. This paper makes available to modern management a system which now in addition to time scheduling and <b>cost</b> <b>budgeting</b> also deals with capacity planning and optimizing in one integrated system...|$|E

Beside it is to analyze whether the accountability accounting as a management controlling had been precisely based on the theory that concerns to the conditions of the firm and how about the theories can solve the problems existing in the firm. The analysis is done by comparing to the basic concept that is requirement to form and retain accountability accounting, that is: organization structure that states clearly about authority and accountability of each management level, <b>Cost</b> <b>Budgeting</b> that is arranged for each of manajement level, cost accounting system that is to be concerned to organization structure, cost reporting system to the management who was accountability. While if it is related to the management controlling so it is also analyzed to the process of management controlling in the firm. From the analysis it shows that the firm has not been fully in applying the concept of the basic of accountability accounting and {{has not been able to}} do the process of management controlling precisely. This matter could be seen in: Account code that does not show separation of controlled cost and uncontrolled cost, organization structure of cost that has not been suited to organization structure, operation of the firm in controlling of expenses and revenues centrally, budgeting that is done just in once in a year.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} factors that affect the {{profitability}} of construction companies in Hong Kong. Profitability refers to income less expenses before taxes, or net operating income, as a percentage construction business turnover (value of construction work done). Profitability is an important indicator of a company’s competitiveness and is also a key performance indicator of the quality a company’s management. This study attempts to measure and explain the observed variations in profitability across construction companies. In this study, I have used construction company production data collected from the Census and Statistics Department (CSD). The data set contains income and expenses data of groups of construction companies classified according to HSIC (Hong Kong Standard Industrial Classification) down to four-digit level over the period 1981 to 2002. The data set was used for empirical analysis. After controlling for depreciation of fixed assets, variation in cost of capital and income from other businesses, our data show that profitability varies with company size, degree of subcontracting and material content. The results suggest that as {{the size of a}} construction company increases, profit margin declines initially. Profit margin then increases as size increases beyond a certain size, which suggests increasing return to scale. The scale effect, however, diminishes slowly and then exhausted when size of the company grows beyond the optimal level, after which the company will experience decreasing return to scale. Empirical data from Hong Kong showed that there were only {{a very small number of}} "over-sized" construction firms that operated beyond the optimal size. This suggests the construction companies in Hong Kong are profit orientated and would not expand beyond the optimal level to achieve other non-profit objectives. In addition, I also found that both the degree of sub-contracting and the level of material content have significant negative impact on the profitability of construction companies in Hong Kong. The former result suggests that profit margin declines as more works are subcontracted out. This implies that in addition to provision of physical resources, subcontractors are also paid for their efforts in managing resources, specialist knowledge and risk taking. The negative impact of material content on profitability suggests that the construction material market is a very competitive market. A construction company cannot charge a significant premium (larger than its profit margin) for provision of construction materials as the construction client or main contractor can also purchase the material at more or less the same price. The results of this study shed light on our understanding of factors that affect the profitability of the construction contracting business, an area that serious lacks empirical study. In addition, the results provide valuable information for the decision makers of construction companies when tendering for construction work and for benchmarking of the profitability performance of their companies.
