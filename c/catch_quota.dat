25|$|In 1982, the IWC finally {{voted in}} favor of a {{moratorium}} on commercial whaling to go into force in 1986 (25–7–5). Japan objected to the moratorium and continued whaling (Under the ICRW an objecting nation is exempted from the disputed regulations. Japan also continued to hunt sperm whales despite a 1981 IWC zero <b>catch</b> <b>quota.).</b> The United States would {{play a significant role in}} Japan's acceptance of a global moratorium on commercial whaling due to its domestic laws. In particular the 1971 Pelly Amendment to the US Fishermen's Protection Act gives the US President legal authority to prohibit importation of fish products from any nation that is diminishing the effectiveness of fisheries conservation programs. It was later strengthened by the 1979 Packwood-Magnuson Amendment to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act giving the same sanctioning power with regard to the ICRW.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} a discrete model of pop-ulation dynamics for the species with simple age struc-ture. The cases when survival rates represent the func-tions of both age groups numbers are considered. We classify {{the types of}} dynamical modes and investigate the scenario of transition from regular to chaotic behav-ior, and vice versa. The optimization problem is stated and investigated. The problem was to find optimum <b>catch</b> <b>quotas</b> and a steady value of population num-ber providing a theoretically maximum possible sus-tainable yield. It is shown that a single age class har-vesting is the optimal one, and a choice of the age class {{is determined by the}} values of population parameters and prices ratio. It is found that stationary harvesting strategy with constant quota stabilizes the population dynamics for definite values of parameters. However, there is a range of the parameters at which there appear two-year fluctuations of number in the population. It leads to the necessity of transfer from harvesting based on constant <b>catch</b> <b>quotas</b> to threshold harvesting. It is shown that the threshold strategy always stabilizes the systems dynamics.

A possible outcome of a reduction in non-capacity-enhancing subsidies is that fisheries output will rise in countries where <b>catch</b> <b>quotas</b> are not enforced and remain the same in countries where <b>catch</b> <b>quotas</b> are strictly enforced, expanding the total supply of fisheries products in the short run.

40|$|Clark's bioeconomic {{model is}} applied to Antarctic minke whales (AMW), the {{backbone}} of the commercial whaling in 1982 when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) opted for a ban on whaling commencing 1985 / 86.

40|$|Right-based fishery {{management}} programs {{started to be}} introduced in Chile since the early 2000 s. For the case of most industrial fisheries, company-allocated (and operationally transferable among firms) percentage-catch quotas were introduced since February 2001, with a 12 -year validity horizon and the initial quota allocation being based on historical fishing presence. In the case of small-scale/artisanal (and de facto informal-exchange based) fisheries, percentage <b>catch</b> <b>quotas</b> at fishermen’s organization level started to be gradually allocated since the early 2000 s, and also based on historical fishing presence. In the artisanal sector, quota allocation programs entitled fishermen’s organizations with (partially) discretional powers for deciding how to distribute, use and control each organization’s allocated quota among its members. This presentation will describe how these different right-based management programs were implemented, the different timings involved, the main interest groups that participated in the negotiations for deciding how and to whom assign <b>catch</b> <b>quotas,</b> the political compromises finally achieved and, finally, it will discuss some evidence about (i) production-related effects observed at different fisheries (including small-pelagi...|$|R
50|$|Also in 2010, ClientEarth {{highlighted}} to the EU fisheries ministers that, {{given the}} rapid decline of bluefin tuna stocks, they were legally obliged to ban bluefin {{fishing in the}} Mediterranean and Atlantic {{for at least three}} years, from 2011-2013. ClientEarth also argued that France's overfishing in 2007 meant they should be banned from receiving any bluefin <b>catch</b> <b>quota</b> in 2011, and that Italy should also be penalised for overfishing, although less severely than France. However, following the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the European Council announced that it unanimously agreed to support total allowable catches (TACs) in line with ICCAT's scientific advice. ClientEarth argued that these TACs would mean only a 30-45 percent likelihood that bluefin levels would recover by 2020, despite EU law demanding that all fish stocks are at sustainable levels by this date.|$|E

25|$|In 1982, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) {{came into}} force, {{as part of}} the Antarctic Treaty System.

40|$|A {{reduction}} of unwanted catches {{is a key}} element of the Common Fisheries Policy reform proposal (EC, 2010). To achieve this, a landing obligation (or discard ban) will be introduced, prohibiting the at-sea disposal of quota-regulated species. Instead these catches shall be brought back to shore and counted against a quota, where applicable. In 2014, upon request by the ministry, more clarity was sought on how <b>catch</b> <b>quotas</b> could be calculated and what they would look like for the most relevant fish species of the Dutch demersal fishery. The report of that study (Miller et al. 2014) provided an overview of total allowable catch allocations (TAC), national quota, landings and discards statistics for some of the most-relevant quota-regulated species caught by the Dutch demersal fleet. A number of scenarios of how the new <b>catch</b> <b>quotas</b> could be calculated were presented.

50|$|In 1928 Salvesen left Oxford {{to enter}} the family business, {{alongside}} his brothers Noel and Norman and his cousin Iver. The work was divided among the partners, with Norman responsible for chartering and agency work and Iver handling merchant shipping. Noel, with his father Theodore, headed the whaling division, which Harold joined. After learning Norwegian - the universal language among the whalers - he spent the summers of 1928/29 and 1929/30 in the Antarctic, the first senior manager to actually visit the Southern Ocean whaling fleet, and came back arguing strongly for more investment and more modern practices. He oversaw the conversion of two factory ships for pelagic whaling, Salvestria and Sourabaya, and brought a new zeal and efficiency to the operations at South Georgia and at sea. The boom in Antarctic whaling {{came to an abrupt}} halt in 1930/31, with the price of oil dropping by half, and over the following years Salvesen was a leading player in the negotiations to establish an agreed <b>catch</b> <b>quota</b> among the whaling firms.

50|$|The main {{argument}} used by Minister Longueira {{to defend}} the legislation {{was that it was}} going to “promote the sustainability of fishing resources,” but, upon examination, this is not the case. “The government’s motive is to reinforce the economic model in place; there is a political interest in making fishery resources belong to someone,” says Cosme Caracciolo, an artisanal fisherman and a member of the National Council for the Defense of Artisanal Fishing (CONDEPP). “Under this fisheries law, 20-year renewable concessions have been awarded, creating ownership over fish that have not yet been born. It’s absurd! It’s applying capitalism to living resources”. “They now want to increase the quota for jack mackerel, which is recognized as an endangered species,” Caracciolo laments. The head of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) for Chile’s Sustainable Fisheries Program, Mauricio Gálvez, backs this view. He insists “the decision of the Chilean National Fishery Council to increase the <b>catch</b> <b>quota</b> of jack mackerel by 11.9 per cent is completely unacceptable, given the current overexploitation of the stock”. One of the simplest methods for identifying a troubled fishery is to compare the average size of mature stock over a period of time. In the case of hake, another popular catch off the cost of Chile, the median length for mature stock has shrunk from 37 centimeters a decade ago to 28 centimeters today. Efforts have been made to block the “Fisheries Act” through petitions to the Constitutional Court sponsored by a number of Congress representatives, but these efforts have yet to see progress. Most of these protests come from indigenous communities, but also from artisanal coalitions.|$|E
