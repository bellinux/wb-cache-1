40|$|The Kings-Kaweah {{ophiolite}} melange in east-central California {{is thought}} to be an obducted oceanic fracture zone and provides the rare opportunity to examine in detail the complex nature of this type of terrain. It is anticipated that the distribution and abundance of components in the melange can be used to determine the relative importance of geologic processes responsible for the formation of fracture zone <b>crust.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> reflectance spectra of field samples indicate that the melange components have distinct, diagnostic absorptions at visible to near-infrared wavelengths. The spatial and spectral resolution of AVIRIS is ideally suited for addressing important scientific questions concerning the Kings-Kaweah ophiolite melange and fracture zones in general...|$|E
40|$|The icy crusts of the Galilean {{satellites}} of Jupiter {{are supposed}} {{to be one of the}} potentially habitable zones of the solar system, and subsurface water oceans are believed to lie beneath them. The ice penetrating radar sounder RIME (Radar for Icy Moon Exploration) housed on board the JUICE (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer) mission is expected to probe the icy crust of Europa, Ganymede and Callisto up to a depth of about 9 km. The main objectives of RIME are: the characterization of the ice shell of Ganymede; the detection of melt materials inside the Europa's ice shell; the determination of the regolith thickness on Callisto. The penetration of the radar signal is strictly connected to the electromagnetic properties of the ice, that in turn depends on the presence of contaminants and temperature profile inside the satellite's <b>crust.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> measurements carried out in the temperature range of (100 - 273) K provided the dielectric properties of pure and doped ice (salts, acids and dusts), whereas temperature profiles are obtained taking into account the heat conduction and diapiric convection models for the Galilean satellites. The combination of electromagnetic and thermal properties of the icy crust, allowed us to generate simulated radar data at the operation frequency of RIME (9 MHz). Such simulations are important to determine the radar performance in the icy crusts, and in particular to estimate the signal penetration and the capability to resolve buried layers...|$|E
40|$|Natural CO 2 {{discharges}} generally {{coincide with}} the in-land segments of major zones of seismicity throughout the world, showing the strong correlation between natural degassing and earthquakes. On the other hand, aftershocks of large earthquakes {{have been attributed to}} the coseismic release of trapped, high-pressure CO 2 -dominated fluids propagating through damaged zones created by the main shock thus underlining the role of the fluids as “agents” able to generate overpressures and reactivate fault segments inducing earthquakes. Recent experimental results have demonstrated that CO 2 can be produced by mechanical stress applied on carbonate rocks sometimes requiring a relatively low energy rates. As a result, crustal volatiles can be produced due to high-pressure, mechanical stresses at moderate levels within the <b>crust.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> experiments, whereby different types of carbonate rocks (natural and synthetic) have been milled, have shown that carbonates release CO 2 systematically and reproducibly leaving little doubt that carbonate rock located in shallow crustal levels may undergo structural break-down to form CO 2, particularly in the presence of accessory phases such as clays. Isotopic ratios of CO 2 and noble gases carried out on both the rocky samples, gases produced during the experimental work and gases from natural vents has demonstrated that, whereas carbonates can account for the origin of crustal-derived CO 2, {{this is not the case}} for helium which is not retained in carbonates. Combining those results with data from natural vents of the Apennine Chain and gases extracted from the basement rocks, such as granite and gneiss, demonstrates that crustal helium can be released only from the basement thus implying that helium has a provenance distinct from that of CO 2 and the seimogenesis involves deep crustal layers. Temporal variations of the  13 C CO 2 might be interpreted either as a consequence of different intensity Gas-Water interactions or a CO 2 production far from the isotopic equilibrium. That CO 2 is released together with crustal-type helium marked by values as low as 0. 02 - 0. 2 Ra Moving the collected results from the laboratory to the natural systems means to improve the possibility of assessing the linkage between variations in geochemical tracers and the onset of seismic activity thus to gain an insight on the seismogenesis. Since crustal deformation can occur also aseismically, and rock deformation may produce CO 2 as a response to mechanical stress accumulation and strain release, monitoring of CO 2 discharges could be useful in estimating the probability increase of an impending earthquake in a potentially hazardous seismic region...|$|E
3000|$|In this section, {{we present}} test models of poroelastic rebound (PE) in the {{continental}} and oceanic <b>crusts.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> and geologic studies indicate that crustal permeability decreases rapidly below about 4 -km depth (Manning and Ingebritsen, 1999).

50|$|Although a {{complete}} section of oceanic crust {{has not yet}} been drilled, geologists have several pieces of evidence that help them understand the ocean floor. Estimations of composition are based on analyses of ophiolites (sections of oceanic crust that are preserved on the continents), comparisons of the seismic structure of the oceanic <b>crust</b> with <b>laboratory</b> determinations of seismic velocities in known rock types, and samples recovered from the ocean floor by submersibles, dredging (especially from ridge crests and fracture zones) and drilling. Oceanic crust is significantly simpler than continental crust and generally can be divided in three layers. According to mineral physics experiments, at lower mantle pressures, oceanic crust becomes denser than the surrounding mantle.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDeterminations {{of stress}} {{magnitudes}} based on inversion of calcite twin data from fault-related folds in the Taiwan Foothills show {{a decrease of}} differential stresses during synfolding erosion and exhumation, suggesting that paleodepth of burial largely controlled the levels of differential stresses sustained by rocks. Regional frictional conditions linked to shallow and/or deep décollement tectonics probably also influenced stress magnitudes. Combination of the twin inversion technique with fracture analysis and rock mechanics data provides first-order estimates of principal stress values related to the major Pleistocene shortening event in Taiwan. These stress estimates are compared to previous stress estimates in fold-thrust belts and to available data on differential stress magnitudes in foreland and hinterland domains of orogens. At the scale of an entire orogenic system the most striking point is a decrease of differential stresses from the hinterland toward the foreland. This decrease not only reflects tectonic stress attenuation away from the plate boundary but also suggests a major control by the depth of deformation. Differential stresses estimated from natural deformation consequently provide an independent support to the depth-dependent strength and the frictional behavior of the upper continental <b>crust</b> deduced from <b>laboratory</b> experiments and stress measurements in deep boreholes...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{compressional wave}} (Vp) and shear wave (Vs) {{velocities}} were measured {{as a function}} of confining pressure for the gabbros from Hole 735 B and compared to results from Leg 118. The upper 500 m of the hole has a Vp mean value of 6895 m/s measured at 200 MPa, and at 500 meters below seafloor (mbsf), Vp measurements show a mean value of 7036 m/s. Vs mean values in the same intervals are 3840 m/s and 3857 m/s, respectively. The mean Vp and Vs values obtained from log data in the upper 600 m are 6520 and 3518 m/s, respectively. These results show a general increase in velocity with depth and the velocity gradients estimate an upper mantle depth of 3. 32 km. This value agrees with previous work based on dredged samples and inversion of rare element concentrations in basalts dredged from the conjugate site {{to the north of the}} Atlantis Bank. Laboratory measurements show Vp anisotropy ranging between 0. 4 % and 8. 8 %, with the majority of the samples having values less than 3. 8 %. Measurements of velocity anisotropy seem to be associated with zones of high crystal-plastic deformation with predominant preferred mineral orientations of plagioclase, amphiboles, and pyroxenes. These findings are consistent with results on gabbros from the Hess Deep area and suggest that plastic deformation may play an important role in the seismic properties of the lower oceanic crust. In contrast to ophiolite studies, many of the olivine gabbros show a small degree of anisotropy. Log derived Vs anisotropy shows an average of 5. 8 % for the upper 600 m of Hole 735 B and tends to decrease with depth where the overburden pressure and the age of the crustal section suggests closure of cracks and infilling of fractures by alteration minerals. Overall the results indicate that the average shear wave splitting in Hole 735 B might be influenced by preferred structural orientations and the average value of shear wave splitting may not be a maximum because structural dips are < 90 °. The maximum fast-wave orientation values could be influenced by structural features striking slightly oblique to this orientation or by near-field stress concentrations. However, flexural wave dispersion analyses have not been performed to confirm this hypothesis or to indicate to what extent the near-field stresses may be influencing shear wave propagation. Acoustic impedance contrasts calculated from laboratory and logging data were used to generate synthetic seismograms that aid in the interpretation of reflection profiles. Several prominent reflections produced by these calculations suggest that Fe-Ti oxides and shear zones may contribute to the reflective nature of the lower oceanic <b>crust.</b> <b>Laboratory</b> velocity attenuation (Q) measurements from below 500 m have a mean value of 35. 1, which is consistent with previous vertical seismic profile (VSP) and laboratory measurements on the upper 500 m...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a recent}} thesis in the {{literature}} that an important organization of a physical system precedes a catastrophic event. In this context, one can search for signatures that imply {{the transition from a}} normal state to a main catastrophic event (e. g. earthquake). Experimental techniques are thus useful in corroborating theories from observed data. For example, recent results indicate that preseismic electromagnetic time series contain information characteristic of an ensuing earthquake event. Hereby, we attempt to demonstrate that an easily computable complexity measure, such as T -complexity or approximate entropy, gives evidence of state changes leading to the point of global instability. The appearance of a precatastrophic state is characterized by significant lower complexity in terms of T -complexity and approximate entropy. The present study confirms the conclusions of previous works based on an independent linear fractal spectral analysis. This convergence between nonlinear and linear analysis provides a more reliable detection concerning the emergence of the last phase of the earthquake preparation process. More precisely, we claim that our results suggest an important principle: significant complexity decrease and accession of persistency in electromagnetic (EM) time series can be confirmed at the tail of the preseismic EM emission, which could be used as diagnostic tools for the Earth's impending <b>crust</b> failure. Direct <b>laboratory</b> and field experimental data as well as theoretical arguments support the conclusions of the present analysis. © 2006 The American Physical Society.

She was treated with systemic antibiotics for secondary bacterial infection several times without any clinical response. Physical examination showed an erythematous swelling on the first toe with an irregular 2. 5 cm ulcer with a raised edge that was infiltrating and destroying the toenail. {{the bottom of the}} ulcer was granular and partially covered with a <b>crust</b> (Fig. 1). <b>Laboratory</b> studies showed a strong positive Montenegro intradermal reaction (2. 5 mm). Other intradermal reactions were also performed, such as purified protein derivative (PPD) and sporotrichin, which were negative. On X-ray examination of the left foot, bone destruction of the distal phalanx of the first toe and a soft tissue swelling were observed (Fig. 2). A biopsy was taken and the histologic picture showed a chronic inflammatory change with tuberculoid-type granuloma and necrosis suggesting leishmaniasis, although parasites were not observed. Based on the clinical, histologic, and immunologic aspects, we concluded that this was a case of leishmaniasis. Methylglucamine (Glucantime(R)) was introduced at a total dose of 17 g of the salt (10 mg/kg daily for 40 days). Immediately after the start of treatment, the lesion began to improve, and 4 months later the lesion had healed completely and the dystrophic nail had started to grow (Fig. 3).

40|$|The {{strength}} of lava crust {{and the role}} of that crust in determining lava flow dynamics and morphology are of fundamental importance in modeling lava flow behavior. Great improvements to flow models have been made by combining theoretical analysis with the results from analog experiments using polyethylene glycol (PEG 600) wax, which solidifies just below room temperature and can be used to simulate solidifying flows. However, a paucity of experimental data on the mechanical properties of solid PEG 600 has limited the quantitative interpretation of the role of crust in these experiments. We have, therefore, conducted experiments to measure the mechanical properties (tensile strength, shear strength, and Young’s modulus) of solidified PEG 600 at temperatures and strain rates similar to those employed in analog experiments. The mechanical properties of PEG 600 can be modeled by a power law function of temperature, with the tensile strength exhibiting an additional dependence on strain rate. At intermediate temperatures, marked changes in the temperature dependence of the Young’s modulus and in the character of failure surfaces indicate a transition from brittle to ductile behavior. We find that the {{strength of}} solid PEG 600 at experimental temperatures and strain rates exceeds that inferred for the <b>crust</b> on active <b>laboratory</b> flows by four orders of magnitude. This discrepancy is best explained by the presence of a thin visco-elastic layer separating the solid surface from the fluid interior of PEG 600 flows, a model that has been suggested to explain the behavior of some basaltic lava flows...|$|R
40|$|In {{the western}} U. S., {{numerous}} exposures of Precambrian crustal rocks were exhumed from mid-crustal depths during Cenozoic tectonic events {{and provide a}} view into the deep <b>crust.</b> This natural <b>laboratory</b> provides an excellent opportunity to study orogenic and continent-forming processes at deeper levels. The Ivanpah Mountains of southeastern California contain exposures of Paleoproterozoic migmatites and banded gneisses that belong to the Mojave crustal province. New, detailed U–Pb geochronology of monazite and zircon from ortho- and paragneisses reveal {{the timing of the}} formation of these rocks and multiple periods of metamorphism and magmatism. Paragneisses have detrital zircon populations of dominantly 1. 80 – 2. 15 Ga (dominant) and 2. 4 – 2. 8 Ga, although the youngest detrital zircon grain is 1. 754 ± 24 Ga. Values of δ 18 O(zircon) of the two detrital age populations are 7. 0 ± 2. 2 ‰ and 6. 3 ± 1. 4 ‰ (2 SD), respectively, consistent with original, igneous values. Based on the 1. 76 Ga age of metamorphic zircon rims, the metasediments were intruded by a calc-alkaline magmatic suite including gabbro, tonalite, and porphyritic granite at 1. 76 Ga, although the contacts are obscured by pervasive metamorphism and deformation. U–Pb ages of metamorphic overgrowths on detrital zircons from the paragneisses indicate multiple events at ∼ 1. 76, 1. 74, 1. 70 and 1. 67 Ga which documents a periodicity of tectonism through time. The oxygen isotope ratios of the metamorphic zircon overgrowths from the paragneisses remained relatively constant through time within each sample, consistent with growth during in situ partial melting. However, oxygen isotope ratios of zircons from 1. 74 Ga leucocratic material are lower in δ 18 O, and therefore could not have been generated by partial melting of the adjacent paragneiss. Monazite from both igneous and metasedimentary rocks preserves two periods of growth at 1. 75 and 1. 67 Ga. In situ, U–Pb dating of monazite reveals that 1. 67 Ga monazite inclusions are found in major rock-forming minerals, and therefore we interpret this as the timing of fabric formation and migmitization, which is younger than previously believed and is interpreted to be the dominant metamorphic pulse in the protracted middle crustal tectonism. Thermobarometry indicates peak metamorphic conditions of ∼ 3. 5 kb and ∼ 740 °C, which is consistent with partial melting and the metamorphic mineral assemblage in these rocks (sillimanite + K-feldspar, muscovite absent). This paper shows (1) multiple pulses identified within 100 Ma orogeny, (2) zircon components and their overgrowths demonstrate mixing of Archean, 1. 8 and younger reservoirs, (3) low pressure granulite facies metamorphism occurred at 1. 67 Ga and may have been related to continental extension of a tectonically over-thickened crust...|$|R
