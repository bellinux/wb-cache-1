50|$|In 1846, as {{the dispute}} over slavery in the United States {{developed}} {{in the wake of}} the Mexican-American War, popular sovereignty became the foundation of a proposed resolution to slavery in the country.

The effort to incorporate these lands into the United States uncovered long-simmering disputes about the extension of slavery - whether it would be permitted, protected, abolished or perpetuated in the newly-acquired areas. Attempts to resolve the issue in Congress led to gridlock. Several Congressional leaders, in an effort to resolve the deadlock over slavery as a <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>admission</b> or administration of the territories, searched for a middle ground.|$|R
