5|$|Yeats's mystical inclinations, {{informed}} by Hindu Theosophical beliefs and the occult, provided {{much of the}} basis of his late poetry, which some critics have judged as lacking in intellectual <b>credibility.</b> The metaphysics of Yeats's late works must be read in relation to his system of esoteric fundamentals in A Vision (1925).|$|E
5|$|According to Pitchfork, {{the album}} was {{important}} for Warp, which had been seeking <b>credibility</b> after relocating their offices to New York City. Herren began acting as A member for the label, which had a reputation only for IDM, by introducing it to artists including Anti-Pop Consortium, Battles, and Flying Lotus.

The success of The Common Linnets in the contest was met with wide praise, with many commenting that their triumph was a boost to the musicality and <b>credibility</b> of the contest.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty {{can have a}} negative effect on attitude toward a brand. If, on the other side, the consumer grants <b>credibility</b> to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that <b>credibility</b> to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to various factors such as lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E
5|$|Announced on 6 May 1997, {{only five}} days after that year's General Election, and officially given {{operational}} responsibility for setting interest rates in the Bank of England Act 1998, the Committee {{was designed to be}} independent of political interference and thus to add <b>credibility</b> to interest rate decisions. Each member has one vote, for which they are held to account: full minutes of each meeting are published alongside the Committee's monetary policy decisions, and members are regularly called before the Treasury Select Committee, as well as speaking to wider audiences at events during the year.|$|E
5|$|Bednar has {{featured}} {{heavily in}} the Ex's public profile, and advocated for openness in communications.

5|$|Boys in the Sand is a {{landmark}} American gay pornographic film released {{at the very}} beginnings of the Golden Age of Porn. The 1971 film was directed by Wakefield Poole and stars Casey Donovan. Boys in the Sand was the first gay porn film to include credits, to achieve crossover success, to be reviewed by Variety, {{and one of the}} earliest porn films, after 1969's Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, to gain mainstream <b>credibility,</b> preceding 1972's Deep Throat by nearly a year.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{realized}} that the charges against the clergy were so serious {{that he had to}} focus on destroying Barreto's <b>credibility.</b> Therefore, he implied that Barreto's own conduct was outrageous because of his excesses in collecting taxes and his habit of paying public funds to licentious women. Additionally, he stated that the real author of the report was José Miguel Vallejo, whom he called an immoral man who despised the clergy. Thus, Espejo claimed the report should not be believed.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{writes that}} Oprah Winfrey's {{promotion}} of Night {{came at a}} difficult time for the genre of memoir, after a previous book-club author, James Frey, {{was found to have}} fabricated parts of his autobiography, A Million Little Pieces (2003). She argues that Winfrey's choice of Night may have been intended to restore the book club's <b>credibility.</b> Night has a useful lesson to teach, Franklin writes, about the complexities of memoir and memory.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Department of Justice {{created the}} Civil Rights Section, which focused {{primarily}} on First Amendment and labor rights. The increasing scrutiny of totalitarianism in the lead-up to World War II brought increased attention to issues of slavery and involuntary servitude, abroad and at home. The U.S. sought to counter foreign propaganda and increase its <b>credibility</b> on the race issue by combatting the Southern peonage system. Under the leadership of Attorney General Francis Biddle, the Civil Rights Section invoked the constitutional amendments and legislation of the Reconstruction Era {{as the basis for}} its actions.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, Romney {{visited the}} United Kingdom, Israel, and Poland, meeting leaders {{in an effort}} to raise his <b>credibility</b> as a world statesman. Comments Romney made about the {{readiness}} of the 2012 Summer Olympics were perceived as undiplomatic by the British press. Israeli Prime Minister (and former BCG colleague) Benjamin Netanyahu, embraced Romney, though some Palestinians criticized him for suggesting that Israel's culture led to their greater economic success.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully {{conduct a}} {{discreet}} {{meeting with a}} Russian informant, Vsevlod Pudovkin, {{who claims to have}} seen a UFO at a secret research center.

Scully becomes upset over the direction her life and career are going.|$|E
5|$|In al-Karak, an-Nasir Ahmad had Tashtamur and Qutlubugha {{executed}} for unclear reasons. The move to execute them appalled the public, with whom an-Nasir Ahmad was steadily losing <b>credibility</b> with. The executions {{were seen as}} a testament of an-Nasir Ahmad's ingratitude {{to the men who}} had supported him and virtually installed him as sultan. Historian Joseph Drory argues that it was because Tashtamur and Qutlubugha compelled him to assume the sultanate and remove him from his self-imposed isolation in al-Karak that made an-Nasir Ahmad resentful toward them.|$|E
5|$|Indonesia used fear of {{communism}} to garner {{varying degrees of}} support among western countries, including the United States and Australia, for its East Timor invasion and occupation. The invasion and suppression of East Timor's independence movement caused great harm to Indonesia's reputation and international <b>credibility.</b> Criticism from the developing world undermined efforts in the 1980s to secure the Non-Aligned Movement chair which Suharto strongly desired for Indonesia and condemnation of Indonesia continued through the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Ladislaus {{intervened in}} a {{conflict}} between Wladislaw I Herman, Duke of Poland, and the duke's illegitimate son, Zbigniew, on the latter's behalf. He marched to Poland and captured Wladislaw I Herman's younger son, Boleslav, in 1093. At Ladislaus's demand, Wladislaw I Herman declared Zbigniew his legitimate son. The Illuminated Chronicle also mentions that the Hungarian troops captured Cracow during Ladislaus's campaign, but the <b>credibility</b> of this report has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{objected to}} Douglas's speech, stating {{that he had}} opposed the Korea bill {{because it did not}} include aid to Taiwan, and had {{supported}} it once the aid had been included. As for the Europe charge, according to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon was so well known as a supporter of the Marshall Plan that Douglas's charge had no <b>credibility.</b> In fact, Nixon had opposed a two-year reauthorization of the Marshall Plan, favoring a one-year reauthorization with a renewal provision, allowing for more congressional oversight.|$|E
5|$|PRSA {{is governed}} by a Leadership Assembly that {{consists}} of delegates representing its membership, {{a board of directors}} and various committees and task forces.

5|$|Sadat {{also played}} his role the {{deception}} plan; in September he had attended the Non-Aligned conference in Algeria, and {{upon his return}} was rumored to be ill. Sadat remained, for several {{days leading up to}} 6 October, out of public sight. Egyptian intelligence planted false stories of his illness in the press and initiated a search for a home in Europe, where Sadat would receive treatment, adding to the rumor's <b>credibility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Severing {{professional}} {{ties with}} father and manager Mathew Knowles, Beyoncé eschewed {{the music of}} her previous releases {{in favor of an}} intimate, personal album. 4s lyrics emphasize monogamy, female empowerment and self-reflection, a result of Beyoncé considering a maturer message to contend artistic <b>credibility.</b> In May 2011, Beyoncé submitted seventy-two songs to Columbia Records for consideration, twelve of which appeared on the standard edition.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before Christmas 1966, {{more than}} seven years since they first met, Presley {{proposed}} to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. Priscilla Presley claims in her autobiography that she was a virgin until their wedding night, which was given <b>credibility</b> {{due to the fact that}} Lisa Marie was born nine months later. However, biographer Suzanne Finstad has questioned this claim.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the major}} {{accounting}} scandals, new reforms, regulations, {{and calls for}} increased higher education have been introduced to combat the dangers of unethical behavior. By educating accountants on ethics before entering the workforce, such as through higher education or initial training at companies, it is believed it will help to improve the <b>credibility</b> of the accounting profession. Companies and accounting organizations have expanded their assistance with educators by providing education materials to assist professors in educating students.|$|E
5|$|The Augustan History {{contains}} {{details of}} Zenobia's early life, although their <b>credibility</b> is doubtful. According to Augustan History, the queen's hobby {{as a child}} was hunting. Apparently not a commoner, she would have received an education appropriate for a noble Palmyrene girl. According to the Augustan History, {{in addition to her}} Palmyrene Aramaic mother tongue, Zenobia was reportedly fluent in Egyptian and Greek and spoke Latin. Around age 14 (c. 255) she became the second wife of Odaenathus, the ras (lord) of Palmyra.|$|E

The players were questioned about their accusations against Malik, and whether their dealings with John detracted from their <b>credibility.</b> Both Waugh and Warne denied any suggestions they played with less determination in the matches in question, stating that they were among the leading players in those games.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to base the creatures on real animals was made early on. To offer players variety, {{a mixture of}} benign and aggressive creatures was deemed necessary. The team decided to implement anthropomorphised bipedal animals, because their humanoid form evoked empathy, and <b>credibility</b> in their potential sentience. Due to technical restraints, bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews for}} its portrayal of homosexuality. Creators Stone and Parker considered it their favorite {{episode of the}} first season, noting that it helped elevate the <b>credibility</b> and relevance of South Park during its early days.

5|$|The genera Escherichia and Salmonella diverged around 102 {{million years}} ago (<b>credibility</b> interval: 57–176mya), which coincides with the {{divergence}} of their hosts: the former being found in mammals and the latter in birds and reptiles. This {{was followed by a}} split of an Escherichia ancestor into five species (E. albertii, E. coli, E. fergusonii, E. hermannii, and E. vulneris). The last E. coli ancestor split between 20 and 30 {{million years ago}}.|$|E
