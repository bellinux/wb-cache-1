25|$|The Kingdom of Laos {{moved toward}} {{independence}} from the French following World War II. Having {{paid little attention to}} fostering local government during their colonization of Laos, the French left a nation woefully short of expertise and leadership. Nor were the French successfully <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Lao communist insurrection sponsored by the Vietnamese communists at the time they left Laos. However, the United States, which had assumed an ever greater burden of funding the Royal Lao Government, assumed the counter-insurgency effort against the communists. The resultant Laotian Civil War predated the Vietnam War; unlike in Vietnam, the Laotian war had to be fought under an assumption of secrecy because of the existence of an international treaty, the Geneva Conference (1954). So it was that the Central Intelligence Agency came to support and wage the Lao counter-insurgency.|$|E

Appearing alongside William Allen Young and Sheryl Lee Ralph, {{she played}} the title role of Moesha Mitchell, a Los Angeles girl <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stepmother {{as well as the}} pressures and demands of becoming an adult. Originally bought by CBS, the program debuted on UPN in January 1996, and soon became their most-watched show. While the sitcom managed to increase its audience every new season and spawned a spin-off titled The Parkers, the network decided to cancel the show after six seasons on the air, leaving it ending with a cliffhanger for a scrapped seventh season. Norwood was awarded an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Youth Actor/Actress for her performance. In 1997, Brandy, Ray J, and their parents started The Norwood Kids Foundation, which helps disadvantaged, at-risk youths in Los Angeles and Mississippi through the arts and self-help programs.|$|E

Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash.

City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.|$|E

While the carnival travels throughout the Southwestern United States, California preacher Brother Justin tends to the needs of Dust Bowl refugees, who slowly become his biggest supporters. Although Carnivàle replaces the real sociological-scientific reasons for the drought conditions with fantasy elements and the presence of the Devil, it still addresses the Dust Bowl situation repeatedly. Samson's catch phrases are variations of [...] "Let's shake some dust!" [...] The episode [...] "Black Blizzard" [...] focuses on Ben and the carnival <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> major dust storm. Rain only occurs twice in the show.

To make sure that I could understand better what Bridget's going through, I studied medical notes on paralysis and disability on the internet."

2500|$|Desgrange and his Tour invented bicycle stage racing. Desgrange {{experimented with}} {{different}} ways of judging the winner. Initially he used total accumulated time (as used in the modern Tour de France) [...] but from 1906 to 1912 by points for placings each day. Desgrange saw problems in judging both by time and by points. By time, a rider <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mechanical problem—which the rules insisted he repair alone—could lose so much time that it cost him the race. Equally, riders could finish so separated that time gained or lost {{on one or two}} days could decide the whole race. Judging the race by points removed over-influential time differences but discouraged competitors from riding hard. It made no difference whether they finished fast or slow or separated by seconds or hours, so they were inclined to ride together at a relaxed pace until close to the line, only then disputing the final placings that would give them points.|$|E

Sebastian began writing songs which appear on the album almost two years before its release, and {{performed}} two of them, [...] "Summer Love" [...] and [...] "Keeper", while touring as a support act on Lionel Richie's Australian and New Zealand tour in March 2011. Both are pop songs, with [...] "Keeper" [...] having a reggae feel. [...] "Summer Love" [...] is about bittersweet feelings for a lost love, and [...] "Keeper" [...] is about finding that special love, the one who is a keeper. [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy", released as the lead single in November 2012, is an upbeat pop song Sebastian wrote after he encountered an angry motorist in Los Angeles. Discussing the inspiration for the track he explained he could sometimes be caught up {{in a little bit of}} [...] "glass half empty" [...] in his life, and wrote the song as a reminder to himself and hopefully to others that life is too short to stress about the small things. Sebastian showcased two more songs, [...] "Amnesia" [...] and [...] "Armageddon", at the [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy" [...] media launch in December 2011. [...] "Amnesia" [...] is a soulful pop ballad about the anguish of <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> broken relationship. Sebastian says of the power ballad [...] "Armageddon", [...] "The title track might sound pretty dark, but it's actually about not taking love for granted, and living like tomorrow is the last day on earth".|$|E
2500|$|Forrest Vosler enlisted as {{a private}} in the Army at Rochester, New York, on October, 8, 1942. [...] He took basic {{training}} at Atlantic City, New Jersey; the Radio Operator and Mechanics School at Scott Field, Illinois; and Flexible Gunnery School at Harlingen, Texas. [...] By May 22, 1943, he had successfully completed his training and three days later was promoted to sergeant. [...] He was promoted to staff sergeant in August at Pyote, Texas, while awaiting overseas movement. [...] In October 1943, he deployed to Europe as a radio operator and aerial gunner on B-17s assigned to the 8th Air Force's 358th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy), 303rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) based at RAF Molesworth, England. [...] At approximately 8:30 a.m. on December 20, 1943, Staff Sergeant Vosler took off on his fourth combat mission. [...] His aircraft, on its 28th combat mission, was a B-17F named the [...] "Jersey Bounce Jr.," [...] S/N 42-29664. [...] The plane and crew reached the target area of Bremen, Germany, just before noon. [...] The bombers encountered concentrated, accurate and intense flak over Axis territory. [...] In addition to the anti-aircraft fire, about 125 German fighters repeatedly attacked the formation. [...] This was a costly mission for the 8th Air Force as a total of 27 bombers were lost including the Jersey Bounce Jr. after it ditched in the North Sea. [...] Staff Sergeant Vosler was seriously wounded in action. [...] Hit initially in the legs and thighs and then again in the face when 20-mm. cannon shells exploded in his aircraft, his B-17 was forced out of formation. [...] During the ditching, Vosler also saved the tail gunner's life. [...] The badly wounded gunner (Sgt. George Buske) {{was removed from the}} still-floating ditched Fortress and put on one of the wings while the other crewmen prepared the life raft. [...] Buske, unconscious, started to slide down the trailing edge of wing into the water. [...] Vosler grabbed him around his waist while using his other hand to hold an antenna wire to avoid falling into the cold water. [...] Vosler accomplished this while <b>coping</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> badly wounded eye that resulted from an earlier exploding 20mm cannon shell that hit his gun position. Staff Sergeant Vosler was recommended for the Medal of Honor based on his heroism and was promoted to technical sergeant two weeks after this mission.
