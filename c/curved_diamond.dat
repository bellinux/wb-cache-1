40|$|This work {{deals with}} study of {{stability}} of solid crystals under isotropic loading. Ab initio methods {{were used for}} this purpose. Crystals of four fcc metals (Al, Cu, Ir, Au) and diamond were subjected to simulated isotropic tensile deformation and maximum value of isotropic stress was evaluated for them. Consequently, phonon spectra were calculated for several strain values {{in order to assess}} crystal stability. Phonon instabilities in dispersion <b>curves</b> of <b>diamond,</b> Al, Ir and Au appeared at strains lower than those corresponding to their decohesion. This appearance of instability determinates the value of ideal strength. However, significant reduction (by about 20 %) was found only in the cases of Au and Ir...|$|R
40|$|The {{bremsstrahlung}} emitted as {{a result}} of scattering electrons in thin diamond crystals provides a useful source of high energy photons for use in photonuclear experiments, since the coherent bremsstrahlung produced is linearly polarized. Techniques for selecting the most favorable diamonds have been investigated. These are optical polaroid analysis, X-ray topography and rocking <b>curve</b> measurements. The <b>diamonds</b> are characterized with a view to determining their performance as radiators, and bremsstrahlung spectra from a diamond radiator used at the Mainz MAMI-B facility are presented. The changes caused by high energy electrons to the crystal properties of the diamond and to the resulting coherent bremsstrahlung spectra are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{synthetic}} {{single crystal}} diamond based Schottky photodiode was tested at INFN-LNS on the proton beam line (62 MeV) {{dedicated to the}} radiation treatment of ocular disease. The diamond detector response was studied in terms of pre-irradiation dose, linearity with dose and dose rate, and angular dependence. Depth dose curves were measured for the 62 MeV pristine proton beam and for three unmodulated range-shifted proton beams; furthermore, the spread-out Bragg peak was measured for a modulated therapeutic proton beam. Beam parameters, recommended by the ICRU report 78, were evaluated to analyze depth-dose <b>curves</b> from <b>diamond</b> detector. Measured dose distributions were compared with the corresponding dose distributions acquired with reference plane-parallel ionization chambers. Field size dependence of the output factor (dose per monitor unit) in a therapeutic modulated proton beam was measured with the diamond detector over the range of ocular proton therapy collimator diameters (5 - 30 mm). Output factors measured with the diamond detector were compared to the ones by a Markus ionization chamber, a Scanditronix Hi-p Si stereotactic diode and a radiochromic EBT 2 film. Signal stability within 0. 5 % was demonstrated for the diamond detector with no need of any pre-irradiation dose. Dose and dose rate dependence of the diamond response was measured: deviations from linearity resulted to be within ± 0. 5 % over the investigated ranges of 0. 5 - 40. 0 Gy and 0. 3 - 30. 0 Gy/min respectively. Output factors from diamond detector measured with the smallest collimator (5 mm in diameter) showed a maximum deviation of about 3 % {{with respect to the}} high resolution radiochromic EBT 2 film. Depth-dose <b>curves</b> measured by <b>diamond</b> for unmodulated and modulated beams were in good agreement with those from the reference plane-parallel Markus chamber, with relative differences lower than ± 1 % in peak-to-plateau ratios, well within experimental uncertainties. A 2. 5 % variation in diamond detector response was observed in angular dependence measurements carried-out by varying the proton beam incidence angle in the polar direction. The dosimetric characterization of the tested synthetic single crystal diamond detector clearly indicates its suitability for relative dosimetry in ocular therapy proton beams, with no need of any correction factors accounting for dose rate and linear energy transfer dependence...|$|R
50|$|Wood's {{congregation}} grew {{to about}} 1,000 members, {{the third largest}} in Lancashire. It occupied Atherton Chapel, the old Bent Chapel, a small brick building with three windows and a porch. Its windows had <b>curved</b> arches with <b>diamond</b> panes of glass in leaded frames. Inside was a three-tier pulpit. The chapel was built in 1645 on land owned by lord of the manor, John Atherton. In 1721 his successor Richard Atherton, {{a supporter of the}} Jacobite cause, expelled James Wood and the congregation from the chapel for their part in the battle. The dissenters left quietly and met in local barns and houses, including the minister's home at Gib Fold, until they had built Chowbent Chapel, completed in 1722 on land donated by Nathan Mort at Alderfold. Wood was instrumental in raising money for the chapel and used his pension towards the cost.|$|R
40|$|To {{exploit the}} full {{potential}} of Kepler light curves, sophisticated and robust analysis tools are now required more than ever. Characterizing single stars with an unprecedented level of accuracy and subsequently analyzing stellar populations in detail are fundamental to further constrain stellar structure and evolutionary models. We {{developed a new}} code, termed Diamonds, for Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison {{by means of the}} nested sampling Monte Carlo (NSMC) algorithm, an efficient and powerful method very suitable for high-dimensional and multi-modal problems. A detailed description of the features implemented in the code is given with a focus on the novelties and differences with respect to other existing methods based on NSMC. Diamonds is then tested on the bright F 8 V star KIC 9139163, a challenging target for peak-bagging analysis due to its large number of oscillation peaks observed, which are coupled to the blending that occurs between ℓ= 2, 0 peaks, and the strong stellar background signal. We further strain the performance of the approach by adopting a 1147. 5 days-long Kepler light <b>curve.</b> The <b>Diamonds</b> code is able to provide robust results for the peak-bagging analysis of KIC 9139163. We test the detection of different astrophysical backgrounds in the star and provide a criterion based on the Bayesian evidence for assessing the peak significance of the detected oscillations in detail. We present results for 59 individual oscillation frequencies, amplitudes and linewidths and provide a detailed comparison to the existing values in the literature. Lastly, we successfully demonstrate an innovative approach to peak bagging that exploits the capability of Diamonds to sample multi-modal distributions, which is of great potential for possible future automatization of the analysis technique.

5000|$|The {{climbing}} sculptures {{were designed}} by Peter Jon Pearce who also designed the Biosphere 2 complex in Arizona, worked for Charles and Ray Eames, and was an assistant to Buckminster Fuller. [...] In addition to playground installations, <b>Curved</b> Spaced <b>Diamond</b> Structures were installed at the 1975 Aspen Design Conference, The Brooklyn Children's Museum, Epcot theme park in Orlando, Florida, and The Hakone Open Air Museum in Japan. The sculptures are constructed of Lexan, a transparent polycarbonate plastic, having a lifespan of at least 20 years. The material used in their construction is tough enough to use as bulletproofing and the joining systems can withstand tensile loads of up to 1000 psi. In 1975, a Curved Space structure was constructed in Aspen Colorado, at the [...] "Aspen Design Conference. Because of an overwhelming number of requests from the community, it was left standing {{until the end of}} summer, long after the conference was over. [...] Three [...] "Curved Space Labyrinths" [...] installed in The Brooklyn Children's Museum in 1976, helped to teach children about the geometry of crystal structures. [...] The Curved Space installation at the Hakone Open Air Museum in Japan was originally installed in 1978, and is frequently referred to as “The Soap Bubble Castle”. Marking the 40th anniversary of the museum, there has been an extensive remodel and the Curved Space playground exhibit has been replaced with a new and updated version. [...] Since 1978, the sounds of happy children have always been heard coming from the exhibit at this museum. [...] Originally installed at a playground in the suburbs of Chicago, one of Pearce's sculptures was available for purchase at the Wright Auction House, which specializes in modern and contemporary art, and according to Art & Antiques Magazine [...] "The structure has subtle richness".|$|R
40|$|Toulouse, France All {{previous}} knowledge {{leading to}} this estimate is of NpO 2 (c) is indirect, based on thermodynamic cycles. The phase itself has heretofore not been observed as a precipitate from aqueous solution. Recent attempts (e. g., Nitsche et al., 1993; Efurd et al., 1996) to establish solubility controls on Np in oxidizing groundwaters (including J- 13 groundwater) starting from high concentrations (i. e., supersaturation) {{have shown the}} formation of {{one or both of}} two Np(V) phases, NaNpO 2 CO 3 : 3. 5 H 2 O(c) (with variable stoichiometry) and Np 2 O 5 (c). These are both highly soluble, yielding Np concentrations on the order of 1 x 10 - 4 to 1 x 10 - 3 molal, in accord with existing thermodynamic data for these phases. No evidence was found of the formation of NpO 2 (c). Under reducing conditions, experiments (Rai et al., 1987 and references cited therein) have shown the formation of Np(IV) polymer, which may be viewed as a hydrated form of NpO 2. It is orders of magnitude less soluble than the Np(V) phases, but still orders of magnitude more soluble than NpO 2 (c). No undersaturation experiments with NpO 2 (c) are known to have been performed. However, both NpO 2 (c) and Np(IV) polymer are known to be difficult to dissolve. We have hypothesized that NpO 2 (c) is simply a phase that is slow to form at low temperature. In this regard, it would be analogous to such minerals as quartz, dolomite, and hematite. It is well known {{that it is difficult to}} impossible to demonstrate the formation of such minerals in low temperature experiments on feasible time scales. However, it is possible to demonstrate their formation and measure the kinetics of the process by conducting experiments at elevated temperatures, generally in the range of 150 - 300 o C (e. g., Rimstidt and Barnes, 1980; Sibley et al., 1984). By developing kinetic models, it should be possible to estimate the appropriate time scales on which such solids might impose solubility constraints on natural groundwaters. To test our hypothesis, we reacted solutions of 1 x 10 - 4 molal NpO 2 + (balanced with Cl-) at 200 o C in closed Parr bombs (with air present). Some runs were conducted in teflon-lined reactors, others in titanium reactors with passivated surfaces. The pH was not buffered, and EQ 3 / 6 calculations indicated that the initial solutions were supersaturated with respect to NpO 2 (c) and undersaturated with respect to other possible Np solids. In the initial runs, the starting 25 o C pH was 6 - 7. Periodically the reactors were cooled, opened, and the Np concentration and pH were measured. The Np concentration slowly dropped (Fig. 1), and the pH dropped to ~ 4. 2. A very fine brown precipitate was observed. XRD analysis shows an eight-line match with NpO 2 (c), validating our hypothesis. Other experiments have been conducted with higher initial pH, and in which the original pH has been periodically restored by the addition of small amounts of base. These show a more rapid drop in dissolved Np (Fig. 1), indicating that the rate of precipitation is pH dependent. The precipitates are being characterized by XRD, EXAFS, and SEM. Additional experiments at 150, 250, and 300 o C are currently planned to allow the development of a kinetic model that can be extrapolated to lower temperature. The use of a mixed flow reactor is also planned in future work. Figure 1. Neptunium molality as a function of time in 200 o C experiments. Top curve (squares) : initial (25 o C) pH 6. 5, no attempt to restore the original pH. Middle curve (circles) : initial pH of 8, pH readjusted.

40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of carbon is mapped to high {{pressure}} using a computationally-tractable potential model. The {{use of a}} relatively simple (Tersoff-II) potential model allows a large range of phase space to be explored. The coexistence (melting) <b>curve</b> for the <b>diamond</b> crystal/liquid dyad is mapped directly by modelling the solid/liquid interfaces. The melting curve {{is found to be}} re-entrant and belongs to a conformal class of diamond/liquid coexistence curves. On supercooling the liquid a phase transition to a tetrahedral amorphous form (ta-C) is observed. The liquid amorphous coexistence curve is mapped onto the pT plane and is found to also be re-entrant. The entropy changes for both melting and the amorphous −> liquid transitions are obtained from the respective coexistence curves and the associated changes in molar volume. The structural change on amorphization is analysed at different points on the coexistence curve including for transitions that are both isochoric and isocoordinate (no change in nearest-neighbour coordination number). The conformal nature of the melting curve is highlighted with respect to the known behaviour of Si. The relationship of the observed liquid/amorphous coexistence curve to the Si low- and high-density amorphous (LDA/HDA) transition is discussed...|$|R
