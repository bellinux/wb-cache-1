5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may <b>change</b> <b>with</b> further research. All three {{are thought to have}} diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes.

Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E

5|$|Consider a {{particle}} moving under an arbitrary central force F1(r) whose magnitude depends {{only on the}} distance r between the particle and a fixed center. Since the motion of {{a particle}} under a central force always lies in a plane, {{the position of the}} particle can be described by polar coordinates (r,θ1), the radius and angle of the particle relative to the center of force (Figure1). Both of these coordinates, r(t) and θ1(t), <b>change</b> <b>with</b> time t as the particle moves.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede {{participates in}} orbital {{resonances}} with Europa and Io: for every orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times. The superior conjunction between Io and Europa always occurs when Io is at periapsis and Europa at apoapsis. The superior conjunction between Europa and Ganymede occurs when Europa is at periapsis. The longitudes of the Io–Europa and Europa–Ganymede conjunctions <b>change</b> <b>with</b> the same rate, making triple conjunctions impossible. Such a complicated resonance {{is called the}} Laplace resonance.|$|E

5|$|The dusky woodswallow has a {{very large}} range. The {{population}} size of this bird {{has not yet been}} quantified or estimated.

5|$|The {{prediction}} that the CMB temperature was {{higher in the}} past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies does not depend directly on redshift. Observations have found this to be roughly true, but this effect depends on cluster properties that do <b>change</b> <b>with</b> cosmic time, making precise measurements difficult.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{begins by}} showing that an animal's surface and volume (or weight) {{increase}} with the square and cube of its length, respectively, and deducing simple rules for how bodies will <b>change</b> <b>with</b> size. He shows {{in a few short}} equations that the speed of a fish or ship rises with the square root of its length. He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.|$|E

The album was released on March 25, 1997, and debuted at number 138 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Machine Head toured in Europe with Napalm Death, Coal Chamber and Skinlab, then went on the first Ozzfest for the first tours {{in support of the}} album. Mader showed up to a practice session late, high on methamphetamine, cursing at and insulting the band members; and quit the band later that day. Ahrue Luster replaced him and finished touring, while Mader toured with Soulfly in support of their self-titled debut album.|$|E

After the publication of Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand, Cook coauthored another book on the subject, Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis: Volume 1– The Physical Climate (2013).
