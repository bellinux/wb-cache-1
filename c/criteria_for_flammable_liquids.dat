Comparison with the results of earlier tests on wooden cupboards for solvents indicates that the steel cupboard tested afforded much less protection from fire to its contents. It must be expected that any simple steel cupboard even if it were of acceptable integrity would, when exposed to a similar fire, permit its contents to be heated sufficiently <b>for</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>liquids</b> in bottles to escape and ignite.

40|$|A tragic {{backdraft}} explosion {{during a}} <b>flammable</b> <b>liquids</b> {{fire in the}} basement of a New York City hardware store caused three firefighter fatalities and numerous injuries on June 17, 2001. The backdraft explosion occurred soon after the firefighters forced open a locked door and boarded window. This paper presents a FDS code simulation of the fire leading up to the backdraft, and an analysis of the deflagration pressure produced by the backdraft. The gasoline pool and subsequent <b>flammable</b> <b>liquid</b> container fire heat release rate history was estimated using fire test data <b>for</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>liquid</b> container storage fires. The calculated oxygen and hydrocarbon gas concentrations at the time the basement door and window were opened satisfy recently reported backdraft occurrence criteria. Furthermore, the calculated temperatures at the upper elevations of the wall furthest from the suddenly opened window were sufficiently high to ignite the oxygen vitiated, hydrocarbon rich gas in the upper layer. Results suggest that the mixing layer was sufficiently thick to allow for rapid flame propagation through it after ignition at the wall on the opposite side of the basement. The large mixing layer and rapid flame propagation produced the deflagration pressures that occurred in this backdraft...|$|R
40|$|New {{developments}} in explosion protection technology {{during the last}} five-to-ten years include: new explosion prevention and suppression systems using either reticulated foam inserts, fine water mist, or onboard oxygen concentration reduction; explosion isolation systems; flameless deflagration venting devices; and new products and methods for design, construction and analysis of blast resistant structures. Key features of these new developments, and the corresponding explosion protection standards that provide guidance on their use, are summarized in this paper. Many of the developments and applications are pertinent to industrial facilities processing or storing large quantities of flammable gases, vapors, or combustible powders.

40|$|The {{flash point}} (FP) of a {{compound}} {{is the primary}} property used {{in the assessment of}} fire hazards <b>for</b> <b>flammable</b> <b>liquids</b> and is amongst the crucial information that people handling <b>flammable</b> <b>liquids</b> must possess as far as industrial safety is concerned. In this work, the FPs of 236 organosilicon compounds were collected and used to construct a quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model for predicting their FPs. The CODESSA PRO software was adopted to calculate the required molecular descriptors, and 350 molecular descriptors were developed for each compound. A modified stepwise regression algorithm was applied to choose descriptors that were highly correlated with the FP of organosilicon compounds. The proposed model was a linear regression model consisting of six descriptors. This 6 -descriptor model gave an R 2 value of 0. 9174, QLOO 2 value of 0. 9106, and Q 2 value of 0. 8989. The average fitting error and the average predictive error were found to be of 10. 34 [*]K and 11. 22 [*]K, respectively, and the average fitting error in percentage and the average predictive error in percentage were found to be of 3. 30 and 3. 60 %, respectively.

50|$|The tank {{container}} was manufactured at 13 December 1973 by a workshop from Bilbao, {{and at that}} time it did not meet the requirements <b>for</b> carrying <b>flammable</b> <b>liquids,</b> since it lacked emergency pressure release valves. Therefore, the tank had been used to carry other substances, some of which were highly corrosive. Tests on the remnants of the steel tank revealed microscopic stress cracks consistent with corrosion caused by previous loads of improperly overpressurized anhydrous ammonia. Combined with whether the tanker suffered an impact that caused additional structural damage, these factors likely led to the almost instantaneous rupture of the tank when the flames flashed back into the tanker. Even without safety valves, a structurally sound and properly filled tanker {{should have been able to}} maintain structural integrity in a fire long enough to at least allow nearby people to escape.|$|R
