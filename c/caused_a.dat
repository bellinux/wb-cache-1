5|$|On 16 June 2011, a welding {{accident}} <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> fire at Hallingskeid Station, {{causing the}} complete {{destruction of the}} platform. This <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> seven days long closure of the line.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{losses were}} heavy. In Florida, the second-largest {{producer}} of oranges in the world, {{damage to the}} citrus crop was estimated at $200million, and <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> 50% increase {{in the price of}} grapefruit juice. Charley, along with the other storms that hit Florida during 2004, <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> total agricultural loss of $2.2billion. Other crops, nurseries, buildings, and agricultural equipment also suffered.|$|E
5|$|As a small storm, Hurricane Danny only <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> damage toll of $ (1997 USD, $  USD). A {{total of}} 4 direct and 5 {{indirect}} deaths {{resulted from the}} effects of Danny.|$|E
50|$|Considerable {{force is}} needed to <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> {{cervical}} fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common <b>causes.</b> <b>A</b> severe, sudden twist to the neck or a severe {{blow to the head}} or neck area can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> cervical fracture.|$|R
50|$|Impaired venous outflow {{is often}} <b>caused</b> by <b>a</b> hypoplastic jugular foramen. This <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> {{increase}} in the intracranial blood volume, thereby <b>causing</b> <b>an</b> increase in intracranial pressure.|$|R

5|$|In the First World War, the {{increasing}} range of naval guns, {{and the great}} fear of high-speed, long-range torpedoes used against warships and merchant ships <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> {{significant increase in the}} use of ship camouflage.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that Hurricane Iniki blew apart many chicken coops, some {{possibly}} used to house fighting chickens; this <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> {{dramatic increase in the}} numbers of wild chickens roaming Kauai.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool won {{a trophy}} treble during Fagan's {{first season as}} manager, winning the League title for the third {{straight}} year, the Football League Cup for the fourth straight year and a fourth European Cup. The following season, the club was involved in one of the worst football stadium disasters. Before the start of the 1985 European Cup Final versus Juventus, Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 mostly Italians fans. This tragedy, the Heysel Stadium disaster, <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> five year UEFA competition expulsion of English clubs.|$|E
50|$|From Newton, {{force can}} be defined as an {{exertion}} or pressure which can <b>cause</b> <b>an</b> object to accelerate. The concept of force is used to describe <b>an</b> influence which <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> free body (object) to accelerate. It can be a push or <b>a</b> pull, which <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object to change direction, have new velocity, or to deform temporarily or permanently. Generally speaking, force <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> object's state of motion to change.|$|R
50|$|The anti-RhE {{antibody}} {{is quite}} common especially in the Rh genotype CDe/CDe; It usually only <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> mild hemolytic disease, but can <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe condition in the newborn. It can occur with other antibodies, usually the anti-Rhc antibody, which can also <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> severe hemolytic disease.|$|R

50|$|Alkalis {{added to}} indium sulfate {{solutions}} precipitate basic salts. For example, potassium hydroxide produces either a basic sulfate, 2 In2O3.SO3•nH2O, or KIn3(OH)6(SO4)2 depending on pH. Sodium pyrophosphate <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> slimy precipitate of indium pyrophosphate, In4(P2O7)3•3H2O. Potassium periodate <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of a basic indium periodate, 2 InO5•In(OH)3•6 H2O. Oxalic acid <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of indium oxalate, In2(C2O4)3•10 H2O. Alkali oxalates <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> precipitate of the alkali dioxalatoindate to form: MIn(C2O4)2•3 H2O where M=Na, K or NH4.|$|R
25|$|The {{highest degree}} of evil deed will <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> soul {{to be born}} into a realm as a denizen of hell, the lower degree of that would <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> soul to be born as an animal, and the lowest degree would <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> soul to be born as a hungry ghost.|$|R

5|$|A new {{civil war}} broke out when Duke Béla claimed the crown for himself in 1059, but his three sons {{accepted}} the rule of Solomon, Andrew I's son, in 1063. Initially, the young king and his cousins cooperated; for instance, they jointly defeated the Pechenegs plundering Transylvania in 1068. The power conflict in the royal family <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> new civil war in 1071. It lasted up to Solomon's abdication in favor {{of one of his}} cousins, Ladislaus, in the early 1080s.|$|E
5000|$|Activation of an endocytic pathway: The {{antibody}} activates <b>a</b> pathway which <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> internalization of desmogleïn 1, {{which in}} turn <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> loss of adhesion.|$|R
50|$|Because it <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> loss of {{sympathetic}} tone, {{which plays}} a major role in other forms of shock, neurogenic shock <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> unique and atypical presentation.|$|R
50|$|Gradual {{presentation}} of stimuli <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> increase in familiarity and thus {{an increase in}} associated know responses; however, gradual presentation <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> decrease in remember responses.|$|R
5|$|A study {{reported}} in 1981 on one mature and three recently clear-cut {{sites in the}} southern Appalachian Mountains near Highlands, North Carolina. All specimens of spiders that hunt were collected on plants or webs above ground. Clear-cutting <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> marked decrease in the abundance of nine species and a marked increase in four species, while M. inclemens and six others showed no change.|$|E
5|$|Accounting for inflation, nine Atlantic hurricanes <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> damage {{total of}} over $10billion (2006USD), {{including}} three from the 2005 season. The costliest was Hurricane Katrina, with damage amounting to $84.6billion, though in normalized dollars it {{may only be}} second to the Great Miami Hurricane of 1926. Of the thirty costliest United States hurricanes, ten were after the year 2000.|$|E
5|$|After Delfina {{moved through}} Mozambique, the local Red Cross chapter {{provided}} shelter, water, and relief items to the affected residents. Residual flooding in northern Mozambique, compounded with lack of drinking water, <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> cholera outbreak that affected at least 400people. By January27, 12people {{had died from}} the disease. Flooding also <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> malaria outbreak that killed 45people in the country. Government officials deployed food to the affected areas by airplane and by road, after workers repaired damaged bridges. Residents in Mozambique gradually recovered from storm damage {{in the weeks after}} it struck. Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas.|$|E

50|$|If an {{aircraft}} in flight suffers a disturbance in pitch that <b>causes</b> <b>an</b> increase (or decrease) in angle of attack, {{it is desirable}} that the aerodynamic forces on the aircraft <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> decrease (or increase) in angle of attack so that the disturbance does not <b>cause</b> <b>a</b> continuous increase (or decrease) in angle of attack. This is longitudinal static stability.|$|R
5|$|Against orders, Ramseur {{attacked}} Averell's smaller force. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry {{was called}} from reserve {{to assist the}} 3rd West Virginia Cavalry when Averell's flanks were threatened. The additional (and unexpected) cavalry <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> Confederate panic, and Averell won the battle.|$|E
5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for the artistic community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness. It <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> fierce controversy in the art world, among museums and among libraries. It challenged established notions of permanence of art and literature, and, as Ashbaugh intended, raised significant problems for archivists seeking to preserve it for the benefit of future generations. Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E
5|$|Although Virginia Tech's {{selection}} via automatic bid {{was relatively}} quiet, Kansas' selection <b>caused</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal of}} controversy. Kansas had lost to Big12 runner-up Missouri and had a lower Bowl Championship Poll ranking than the Tigers. Some believed that Missouri should have been selected ahead of Kansas because they had defeated Kansas and because they had played in the Big12 Championship Game. According to BCS officials, however, Missouri's two losses were more of a detriment than Kansas's one loss and subsequent championship game absence.|$|E

40|$|Results of {{perfusion}} {{of excess}} Ca++ and Na+ into the hypothalamus of the hibernating ground squirrel Citellus beechyi are presented. The significant {{finding is that}} perfused excess Ca++ <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> reduction in core temperature when ambient temperature is low (12 C). Ca++ also <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> rise in rectal temperature at high ambient temperature (33 C). Thus hypothalamic Ca++ perfusion apparently <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> nonspecific depression of thermoregulatory control...|$|R
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects <b>an</b> object. This <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> change in the heart's heat, which <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of}} the heart also <b>causes</b> <b>a</b> change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|R
