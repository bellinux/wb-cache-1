The test result shows that aqueous solution and sodium carbonate will cause tungsten carbide leaching through oxidative dissolution; but compound boricacidester contain benzotriazole could suppress tungsten carbide leaching.

Wear mechanism of <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> <b>tool</b> in high speed milling {{of stainless steel}} 0 Cr 13 Ni 4 Mo was studied in this work. Machining tests on high speed milling of 0 Cr 13 Ni 4 Mo with a <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> <b>tool</b> are conducted. The cutting force and cutting temperature are measured. The wear pattern is recorded and analyzed by high-speed camera, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). It is found that adhesive wear was the dominant wear pattern causing tool failure. The process and microcosmic mechanism of the tool’s adhesive wear are analyzed and discussed based on the experimental results. It is shown that adhesive wear of the tool occurs due to the wear of coating, the affinity of elements Fe and Co, and the grinding of workpiece materials to the tool material. The process of adhesive wear includes both microcosmic elements diffusion and macroscopic cyclic process of adhesion, tearing and fracture.|$|E

Currently, {{it is hard to}} restore the recycled tungsten carbide powder entirely as raw material for new processed <b>cemented</b> <b>carbide</b> <b>tool.</b> In this study, to suggest positive use of recycled tungsten carbide powder, we have tried to fabricate a carbon based sintered steel which shows reinforced mechanical properties with recycled tungsten carbide powder. We have made set of newly designed sintered steels. Compression test of sintered specimen in density ratio of 0. 85 (which means 15 % porosity inside) has been conducted. As results, at least 1. 7 times higher in nominal strength in the amount of 7. 0 wt. % was shown in recycled WC powder. The strength reached to over 600 MPa for the Fe-WC-Co-Cu sintered alloy.
