A credit card differs from a <b>charge</b> <b>card</b> also in that a credit card typically involves a third-party entity that pays the seller and is reimbursed by the buyer, whereas a <b>charge</b> <b>card</b> simply defers payment by the buyer until a later date.|$|E

500|$|The dog {{has been}} {{neglected}} or treated unfavorably {{by the family}} in some episodes. In [...] "Dog of Death" [...] (season three, 1992), he nearly dies of bloat and they decide to make budget cuts {{in order to pay}} for the required operation. Although the dog's life is saved, the family begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices and starts treating him badly, causing him to run away. He ends up in the possession of Mr. Burns, who trains him to become a vicious attack dog. Several days later, Bart stumbles upon the trained Santa's Little Helper and is attacked, but the greyhound eventually recognizes his old friend and stops. In [...] "The Canine Mutiny" [...] (season eight, 1997), Bart uses a fake <b>charge</b> <b>card</b> to buy a well-trained rough collie named Laddie from a mail-order catalog. Laddie learns many tricks that Santa's Little Helper is completely unable to perform, and the Simpson family nearly forgets about their old pet. Bart eventually gives Santa's Little Helper away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his too perfect new dog, Bart tries to get him back. When he finally finds him, Santa's Little Helper is serving as a seeing-eye dog for a blind man, but eventually decides to return to the family.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{customers}} paying different merchants {{using the same}} card was expanded in 1950 by Ralph Schneider and Frank McNamara, founders of Diners Club, to consolidate multiple cards. The Diners Club, which was created partially through a merger with Dine and Sign, produced the first [...] "general purpose" [...] <b>charge</b> <b>card</b> and required the entire bill to be paid with each statement.

2500|$|In 1934, American Airlines and the Air Transport Association {{simplified}} {{the process}} even {{more with the}} advent of the Air Travel Card. They created a numbering scheme that identified the issuer of the card as well as the customer account. This is the reason the modern UATP cards still start with the number 1. With an Air Travel Card, passengers could [...] "buy now, and pay later" [...] for a ticket against their credit and receive a fifteen percent discount at any of the accepting airlines. By the 1940s, all of the major US airlines offered Air Travel Cards that could be used on 17 different airlines. By 1941 about half of the airlines' revenues came through the Air Travel Card agreement. The airlines had also started offering installment plans to lure new travelers into the air.
