5|$|Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term {{official}} SPC Forecast Product, {{and often}} change significantly {{from day to}} day. This extended forecast for severe weather was an experimental product until March 22, 2007, when the Storm Prediction Center incorporated it as an official product. Areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of severe weather in the Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster <b>confidence</b> <b>is</b> not fully resolute on how severe weather will evolve more than three days out, the Day 4–8 outlook only outlines {{the areas in which}} severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.|$|E
5|$|Registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam) shirks his {{responsibilities}} by excessively delegating to Oliver; to his dismay, Connie appoints him as Oliver's mentor. Oliver pushes himself {{too far in}} an attempt to impress Greg, which earns the senior doctor a reprimand for leaving him unsupervised. Oliver tries to earn back Greg's respect, but panics while attempting to insert a chest drain, and has to be rescued by ward sister Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori). He invites her for a drink as thanks, but when Penny discovers that Frieda has romantic feelings for him, Oliver cancels as he does not reciprocate them. Oliver's <b>confidence</b> <b>is</b> further damaged when he mishandles a case, which results in a mother leaving her son to die alone. He moves back to the AAU, where he is shaken by an encounter with the boy's mother, which causes him to panic and embarrass himself in theatre. Penny's career begins to improve, and Oliver resents her when she is given registrar duties for a shift. Having realised that he is close to failing his F2 year, Oliver implicates Penny in a serious surgical error of his own doing, but is caught by registrar Antoine Malick (Jimmy Akingbola).|$|E

Sid Jenkins (Mike Bailey) is Tony's best friend and has an entirely opposite personality. He lacks <b>confidence,</b> <b>is</b> socially uneasy and struggles with school work. Tony's girlfriend is Michelle Richardson (April Pearson), a girl who can never stay angry at his mischievous behaviour for long. Outwardly, Michelle appears shallow, vain and conceited, but she works hard, has a strong interest in French and Spanish, and is very emotionally mature. She is friends with Cassie Ainsworth (Hannah Murray), an eccentric girl who suffers from an eating disorder. Cassie attempts to hide her own struggles with mental health while her flamboyant parents ignore her in favour of their new baby.|$|E
25|$|Details of Timesitheus' {{policies}} and achievements as the (probable) de facto {{ruler of the}} Empire {{during the reign of}} his son-in-law are sparse. There is evidence of substantial road repairs undertaken {{in many parts of the}} Roman World which would have been of economic and strategic significance. Monuments were restored in major cities which might have lifted civilian morale as well as providing employment for sculptors, stonemasons etc. It also seems that there was a thoroughgoing adjustment of the African frontier. It is not possible to tell how far such measures reflected policy guidelines issued by Timesitheus' office to provincial authorities, still less what detailed planning was carried out there. The most that can be said with any <b>confidence</b> <b>is</b> that he does not seem to have stood in the way of functionaries, such as the procurator of Mauretania, who conceived and drove forward such works.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the 2010 general election, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats {{pledged to}} {{introduce}} fixed-term elections. As {{part of the}} Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreement, the Cameron ministry agreed to support legislation for fixed-term Parliaments, with {{the date of the}} next general election being 7 May 2015. This resulted in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which removed the prime minister's power to advise the monarch to call an early election. The Act only permits an early dissolution if Parliament votes for one by a two-thirds supermajority, or if a vote of no <b>confidence</b> <b>is</b> passed by a majority and no new government is subsequently formed within 14 days. However, the prime minister had the power, by order made by Statutory Instrument under section 1(5) of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, to fix the polling day to be up to two months later than 7 May 2015. Such a Statutory Instrument must be approved by each House of Parliament. Under section 14 of the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was amended to extend the period between the dissolution of Parliament and the following general election polling day from 17 to 25 working days. This had the effect of moving forward the date of the dissolution of the Parliament to 30 March 2015.|$|E

Dig Me Out appeared at No. 4 in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1997. In the poll's accompanying essay, Christgau referred to the album as one of his [...] "favorite albums of the year, easy", alongside those by Pavement, Sleater-Kinney, and Arto Lindsay.

Kyla is devastated when Max applies for a Guardianship Order, and becomes negligent at work, leading to the deaths of two patients.

He continued in the role throughout the English summer, playing both Tests against New Zealand and all five Ashes Tests against Australia. Buttler's batting during the Ashes series was criticised by Boycott, saying [...] "Jos Buttler is like a rabbit caught in the headlights of Ashes cricket. A seven-year-old schoolboy would have played better. He hasn't made a run all series. He hasn't shown any application whatsoever.

500|$|According to Bede, Æthelberht was descended {{directly}} from Hengist. Bede gives {{the line of}} descent as follows: [...] "Ethelbert was son of Irminric, son of Octa, and after his grandfather Oeric, surnamed Oisc, the kings of the Kentish folk {{are commonly known as}} Oiscings. The father of Oeric was Hengist." [...] An alternative form of this genealogy, found in the Historia Brittonum among other places, reverses the position of Octa and Oisc in the lineage. The first of these names that can be placed historically with reasonable <b>confidence</b> <b>is</b> Æthelberht's father, whose name now usually is spelled Eormenric. The only direct written reference to Eormenric is in Kentish genealogies, but Gregory of Tours does mention that Æthelberht's father was the king of Kent, though Gregory gives no date. Eormenric's name provides a hint of connections to the kingdom of the Franks, across the English channel; the element [...] "Eormen" [...] was rare in names of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy, but much more common among Frankish nobles. [...] One other member of Æthelberht's family is known: his sister, Ricole, who is recorded by both Bede and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as the mother of Sæberht, king of the East Saxons (i.e. Essex).|$|E
