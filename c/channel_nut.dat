5000|$|The word [...] "penis" [...] {{is taken}} from the Latin word for [...] "tail." [...] Some derive that from Indo-European *pesnis, and the Greek word πέος = [...] "penis" [...] from Indo-European *pesos. Prior to the {{adoption}} of the Latin word in English the penis was referred to as a [...] "yard". The Oxford English Dictionary cites an example of the word yard used in this sense from 1379, and notes that in his Physical Dictionary of 1684, Steven Blankaart defined the word penis as [...] "the Yard, made up of two nervous Bodies, the <b>Channel,</b> <b>Nut,</b> Skin, and Fore-skin, etc." ...|$|E

50|$|In January 2009, price-drop tv was {{replaced}} by Quest, gambling service Super Casino launched in new space on the SDN multiplex, Turner <b>channel</b> <b>Nuts</b> TV was closed and replaced with four-hours of news channel CNN International, and Arqiva announced that their latest new channel slot had been sold to UKTV who now use it to broadcast Dave ja vu (originally Dave +1, and is a one-hour timeshift of Dave). Then, Russia Today TV announced {{that they were going}} to broadcast for a small amount of time during the day, timesharing with Dave +1. Also, January saw NETPLAY TV launch on channel 49, timesharing with Super Casino on 48. This shows Rocks&Co and various JML presentations throughout the day. Finally, Directgov launched on channel 106.|$|R

30|$|Ecological notes. Specimens {{were found}} in shallow to deep burrows along the water <b>channels</b> of betel <b>nut</b> {{plantations}} (Figure  4), which were once rice fields (A.R. Sudha Devi, unpublished data). Forest or grasslands were the natural habitats for the new species before their conversion to rice fields. These semi-terrestrial crabs dwell in burrows adjacent to water channels or away from it in open or shaded areas of the banana and betel nut plantations. These crabs are also found in marshy lands and along the paddy field embankments. Normally, their burrow openings are surrounded by wet clods (Figure  4 B,C). The burrows are waterlogged during rainy season whereas the burrow openings are sealed with mud during dry seasons {{in order to maintain}} humidity inside.|$|R
40|$|The paper reveals one of {{possible}} methods for higher productivity {{and reliability of}} building self-propelled pneumopunchers which are intended for making holes in soil while using trenchless method and constructing various engineering communications under car, tram and rail lines, airport runways. A new design of building pneumopuncher with increased productivity due to higher speed for hole formation in soil and its reliability has been presented in the paper. A formula for determination of displacement increment for a new pneumopuncher {{in comparison with the}} conventional one has been obtained in the paper. The paper describes a design and operation principal of the building self-propelled pneumopuncher which is equipped with a locking mechanism with the purpose to neutralize action of soil elastic forces and reactive repulsive force. The locking mechanism keeps the pneumopuncher in the hole. The pneumopuncher consists of a body with anvil, movable hammer, a manifold which is set in axial deepening of the hammer, a nut and a locking mechanism. Improvement of operational pneumopuncher reliability is attained {{due to the fact that}} the locking mechanism is made in the form of two coaxially positioned inner and outer cups having a common basis. A piston is installed in the middle of the inner cup, a spring is fixed over the piston and a rod with a breaking shoe is positioned at the end. Height of the inner cup is less the outer cup height and there is an annular cavity between them which is connected with a chamber. The chamber is formed by the piston, the inner cup and the manifold. The annular cavity through an opening in the inner cup wall, two sylphons, a <b>channel</b> in the <b>nut</b> end and an opening in the vertical wall of the manifold are connected with a chamber of operating stroke. The sylphons are placed between the outer cup and the nut, between the nut and the manifold. Differential equations for movement of pneumopuncher in soil have been compiled. While solving the equations a formula for determination of increase in displacement of the pneumopuncher with the locking mechanism and without it has been obtained in the paper. </p...|$|R
