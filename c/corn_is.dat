5|$|E85 flex-fuel {{vehicles}} {{are becoming increasingly}} common in the Midwest, where <b>corn</b> <b>is</b> a major crop and is the primary feedstock for ethanol fuel production. Regional retail E85 prices vary widely across the US, with more favorable prices in the Midwest region, where most <b>corn</b> <b>is</b> grown and ethanol produced. Depending of the vehicle capabilities, the break-even price of E85 has to be between 25 and 30% lower than gasoline.|$|E

5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of these characteristics, it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy <b>corn</b> <b>is</b> poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} crop of the Mikea is corn, which {{was introduced to}} Madagascar in the 1890s. They also occasionally grow manioc. The dry season is used to cut new corn fields, which are burned in October (swidden agriculture, locally termed hatsaky) and planted in November and December as the rains begin to fall. This <b>corn</b> <b>is</b> harvested three months later and consumed during the wet season; surplus is dried and sold, with some saved for the following year's planting and consumption.
