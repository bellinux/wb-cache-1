5|$|Following the 1947 {{nationalisation}} of Britain's railways, {{the use of}} {{the railway}} to transport <b>coffins</b> to Brookwood went into steep decline. New operating procedures required that <b>coffins</b> be carried in a separate carriage from other cargo; as regular services to Brookwood station used electric multiple unit trains which did not have goods vans, <b>coffins</b> for Brookwood had to be shipped to Woking and then carried by road for {{the last part of the}} journey, or a special train had to be chartered. The last railway funeral to be carried by British Rail anywhere was that of Lord Mountbatten in September 1979, and from 28 March 1988 British Rail formally ceased to carry <b>coffins</b> altogether. Since Mountbatten, the only railway funeral to be held in the United Kingdom has been that of former National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers General Secretary Jimmy Knapp, carried from London to Kilmarnock for burial in August 2001.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{settlement}} during the relocation of the London terminus, two new hearse vans {{were given to the}} LNC by the LSWR in 1899. These new hearse vans were longer, and divided into three levels with compartments for eight <b>coffins</b> on each, for a total of 24 <b>coffins</b> per van. These replaced the existing hearse vans and remained in use until the closure of the Necropolis Railway. One of the vans was destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus; the other was transferred to the SR and remained in use until at least 1950. The former Royal Train brought into passenger service on the London Necropolis Railway in 1939 had a large amount of luggage space, and it is probable that when funeral traffic was light the hearse vans were not used and the <b>coffins</b> carried in the luggage space.|$|E

50|$|At Dabona, a site {{connected}} with the Dian culture, archaeologists discovered a large double <b>coffin</b> burial; The outer <b>coffin</b> was made of wood and the inner <b>coffin</b> was made of bronze. The inner <b>coffin</b> was shaped like a house and weighs over 157 kg.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the grand Roman villa was being {{excavated}} at Durley Hill Cemetery, a second smaller villa was discovered during the construction of Fry's Somerdale Chocolate Factory. Two fine stone <b>coffins</b> were found, interred with the remains of a man and a woman. The villa and <b>coffins</b> were removed to a place near the gates of the factory grounds, and construction on the factory went ahead. Fry's built in the grounds of the factory a museum which for many years housed the Durley Hill mosaics, the <b>coffins,</b> and numerous other artefacts. In 2012, Taylor Wimpey, about to develop the factory site, made a detailed geophysical assessment of the area, and discovered an additional 15 Roman buildings centered around a Roman road beneath Keynsham Hams, with evidence of additional Roman buildings that had been disturbed by quarrying.|$|E
5|$|Banton {{was already}} {{inhabited}} during pre-colonial times as proven by ancient artefacts such as wooden <b>coffins</b> and skeletal remains {{found in the}} island's caves in 1936 {{by a team of}} researchers from the National Museum of the Philippines. Among the artefacts was the Banton Cloth, a piece of a traditional burial cloth found in one of the wooden <b>coffins.</b> It is estimated to be 400 years old, making it the earliest known warp ikat (tie-resist dyeing) textile in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. These artifacts are now preserved at the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.|$|E
5|$|The <b>coffins</b> of General Sikorski and his Chief-of-Staff, General Kilimecki, were {{draped in}} the Polish National Flag and lay in {{state in the}} Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned. After a Requiem Mass, the bodies were carried in {{procession}} to the H.M. Dockyard with full Military Honours to be shipped to London in anticipation that General Sikorski's remains {{would one day be}} returned to a liberated Poland. The route to the dockyard was lined by British troops and the <b>coffins</b> carried and escorted by Polish Servicemen.|$|E

5|$|On Edward's {{death in}} 1648, Anthony Hungerford, his half-brother, {{inherited}} the castle. The north chapel was extensively renovated {{during this period}} by Edward's widow, Margaret Hungerford, who covered the walls with pictures of saints, cherubs, clouds, ribbons, crowns and heraldry, {{as part of an}} elaborate tomb for her and Edward which cost £1,100 (£136,000 in 2009 terms). The renovation effectively blocked most of the access into the north chapel, making the new tomb the focus of attention for any visitor or religious activity. A number of lead, anthropomorphic <b>coffins,</b> some with moulded faces or death masks, were laid down in the crypt in the mid- to late-17th century. Four men, two women and two children were embalmed in the castle in this way, probably including Edward and Margaret, as well as the final Sir Edward Hungerford, his wife, son and daughter-in-law. Such lead <b>coffins</b> were extremely expensive during the period and reserved for the wealthiest in society. Originally the lead <b>coffins</b> would have been encased in wood, but this outer casing has since been lost.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} North or South station <b>coffins</b> would usually be {{unloaded}} onto a hand-drawn bier and pulled by LNC {{staff to the}} appropriate chapel. While this was taking place the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station. On arrival at the chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service (third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel for all those being buried). For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC's London terminus the <b>coffins</b> would be taken directly from the train to the grave.|$|E

5|$|The {{foundations}} that Jackson discovered {{during the}} excavations were left exposed {{for the benefit}} of visitors and larger numbers of tourists began to come to the castle to see the ruins, including Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte in 1846. The lead <b>coffins</b> in the chapel crypt were popular with tourists, although the <b>coffins</b> were extensively damaged by those visitors keen to see the contents inside. The south-west tower, completely covered by thick ivy, collapsed in 1842, after local children accidentally set fire to the vegetation that was, by then, holding the tower together. Battlements were added to the east gatehouse during this period, transforming the appearance of its original gabled roof.|$|E
5|$|A {{circle of}} Bronze Age stone <b>coffins</b> {{was found on}} the Drumpellier estate in 1852. A number of other Bronze Age urns and relics have been found in Coatbridge. An Iron Age wood and thatch crannóg {{dwelling}} was sited in the Loch at the present day Drumpellier Country Park. Dependent upon the water level in the loch, the remains can still be seen today.|$|E
5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Kingdom of Madagascar, the French colonial authorities shifted the location of these tombs thereby disrupting the original cosmological symbolism of their arrangement. When the original tombs were excavated for relocation, the French found the mortal remains of the nobles within had each been wrapped in numerous traditional lambas (woven silk cloths) then set within wooden <b>coffins</b> packed with charcoal. Bodies buried at Ambohimanga were found to have been entombed in the same way.|$|E

5|$|Coffin, wooden: The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} wooden coffin remains, dated at 5000 BC, {{was found in}} the Tomb 4 at Beishouling, Shaanxi. Clear evidence of a wooden coffin {{in the form of a}} rectangular shape was found in Tomb 152 in an early Banpo site. The Banpo coffin belongs to a four-year-old girl, measuring 1.4m (4.5ft) by 0.55m (1.8ft) and 3–9cm thick. As many as 10 wooden <b>coffins</b> have been found from the Dawenkou culture (4100–2600 BC) site at Chengzi, Shandong. The thickness of the coffin, as determined by the number of timber frames in its composition, also emphasized the level of nobility, as mentioned in the Classic of Rites, Xunzi and Zhuangzi. Examples of this have been found in several Neolithic sites; the double coffin, the earliest of which {{was found in the}} Liangzhu culture (3400–2250 BC) site at Puanqiao, Zhejiang, consists of an outer and an inner coffin, while the triple coffin, with its earliest finds from the Longshan culture (3000–2000 BC) sites at Xizhufeng and Yinjiacheng in Shandong, consists of two outer and one inner <b>coffins.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the post}} medieval period {{until the early}} 18th century it served as a {{hospital}} for the local population. In 1829 repairs were carried out to the church. Excavations in 1885 found floor tiles with coats of arms and a pavement from the 14th century beneath which were several <b>coffins.</b> According {{to the findings of}} later resistivity and gradiometer surveys there may also have been a formal Tudor garden and there may have been fish ponds.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without <b>coffins</b> in many places.|$|E
50|$|The <b>coffin</b> house {{reflects}} Brixham humour: it is coffin-shaped {{and when}} a father was asked for the hand in marriage of his daughter, {{he said he would}} 'see her in a <b>coffin,</b> before she wed'.

In these films, <b>Coffin</b> Joe is not the central character and generally inhabits an abstract realm such as nightmares, hallucinations and hell. Despite its title, The Strange World of <b>Coffin</b> Joe does not contain the <b>Coffin</b> Joe character.|$|R
