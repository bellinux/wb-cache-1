40|$|Dielectric {{properties}} of polycrystalline ferroelectric ceramics and ferroelectrics with <b>compensated</b> <b>impurities</b> were investigated. Electric fields at {{the boundaries between}} crystallites and the fields created by a random distribution of impurities were calculated. It was shown, that the influence of these fields leads {{to an increase in}} the effective dielectric constant and to a displacement of the phase transition temperature in these ferroelectrics to lower temperatures. These effects are associated with an asymmetric nonlinear dependence of the thermodynamic potential near to the equilibrium value of spontaneous polarization vector. The asymmetry of this dependence in the random electric and elastic fields with a zero mean value reduces the length of the spontaneous polarization vector. The polarization reduced by the indicated fields lies in a region with less curvature of the thermodynamic potential that effectively means growth the value of dielectric constant of the studied system...|$|E

The theory takes account both of the photoinduced generation of carriers and of thermal generation that is due to the finite temperature of the detector. Explicit formulas are derived that relate the detector response time, responsivity, and noise equivalent power to the material properties of the photoconductor (such as the presence of <b>compensating</b> <b>impurities)</b> and to the detector's operating conditions, such as its temperature and the presence of background radiation.

40|$|The {{concept of}} fully encapsulated, semi-insulating silicon (SI-Si), Czochralski-silicon-on-insulator (CZ-SOI) {{substrates}} for silicon microwave devices is presented. Experimental results show that, using gold as a <b>compensating</b> <b>impurity,</b> a Si resistivity of order 400 kΩcm {{can be achieved}} at room temperature using lightly phosphorus doped substrates. This compares favourably with the maximum of ∼ 180 kΩcm previously achieved using lightly boron doped wafers and {{is due to a}} small asymmetry of the position of the two gold energy levels introduced into the band gap. Measurements of the temperature dependence of the resistivity of the semi-insulating material show that a resistivity ∼ 5 kΩcm can be achieved at 100 °C. Thus the substrates are suitable for microwave devices working at normal operating temperatures and should allow Si to be used for much higher frequency microwave applications than currently possible. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R
40|$|Using {{numerical}} renormalization group techniques, {{we study}} static and dynamic properties {{of a family}} of single-channel Kondo impurity models with axial magnetic anisotropy $DS_z^ 2 $ terms; such models are appropriate to describe magnetic impurity atoms adsorbed on non-magnetic surfaces, which may exhibit surface Kondo effect. We show that for positive anisotropy $D$ and for any spin $S$, the systems behave at low temperatures as regular Fermi liquids with fully <b>compensated</b> <b>impurity</b> spin. The approach to the stable fixed point depends on the value of the spin $S$ and on the ratio $D/T_K^{(0) }$, where $T_K^{(0) }$ is the Kondo temperature {{in the absence of the}} anisotropy. For S= 1, the screening occurs in two stages if $DT_K^{(0) }$. For negative anisotropy $D$, the system is a non-Fermi liquid with residual anisotropic exchange interaction. However, the presence of transverse magnetic anisotropy $E(S_x^ 2 -S_y^ 2) $ restores Fermi-liquid behavior in real systems. Comment: 14 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

An experiment to demonstrate the feasibility of these devices for practical application is described.

40|$|Hall {{effect in}} n-ZnSe single {{crystals}} doped with Cu, Ag or Au transition metals is {{studied in the}} temperature range from 55 to 500 K. A sign inversion of the Hall coefficient at T> 300 K is observed for the crystals doped with Cu, {{in contrast to the}} samples doped with Ag and Au. The measurements of electrical parameters show that silver manifests itself as an usual <b>compensating</b> acceptor <b>impurity</b> (AgZn), while gold is an amphoteric impurity, which forms both donors (Aui) and simple (AuZn) or associative acceptors. The model, which explains the existence of the Hall coefficient anomaly in n-ZnSe:Zn:Cu crystals and its lack in n-ZnSe:Zn:Ag and n-ZnSe:Zn:Au crystals, is proposed. It is shown that Cu exists in n-ZnSe in two charge states: CuZn+ (d 10) and CuZn++ (d 9), while Ag and Au exist in a singly charge...|$|R
40|$|Using several {{derivatives}} of scanning force microscopy with conducting tips, we find {{direct evidence}} {{for the existence of}} a highly <b>compensated</b> donor <b>impurity</b> band in GaN films near the sapphire substrate interface. Scanning current-voltage and capacitance microscopy measurements both show that the free electron density is much higher in the interfacial region of these films. However, surface contact potential images reveal that the Fermi level in the interfacial region is 50 meV to 100 meV deeper into the bandgap {{than it is in the}} less conducting bulk film. These results are inconsistent with a high density of electrons in the intrinsic conduction band. Rather, they point to the existence of a partially filled donor impurity band with the Fermi level in the impurity band. We show that this anomalous conduction behavior most likely originates from a high concentration of oxygen and the defective microstructure at the GaN/sapphire interface...|$|R

Electronic potentials, density of electronic states, cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy (XSTM) images are calculated using first-principles numerical simulations. Doping configurations with <b>compensating</b> Si <b>impurities</b> in cationic and anionic sites, such as the donor–acceptor bilayer, are characterized by XSTM images with bright signal at negative bias, strongly attenuated when the bias is reversed. These features are characteristic of real samples above the onset of self-compensation.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{impurity}} atoms {{as well as}} various growth methods {{to the formation of}} vacancy type defects in gallium nitride (GaN) have been studied by positron annihilation spectroscopy. It is shown that vacancy defects are formed in Ga or N sublattices depending on the doping of the material. Vacancies are decorated with impurity atoms leading to the compensation of the free carriers of the samples. In addition, the vacancy clusters are found to be present in significant concentrations in n-type as well as in p-type GaN. Nitrogen vacancies <b>compensate</b> Mg <b>impurities</b> in magnesium doped GaN. The high Mg content creates a defect profile with a low vacancy concentration near the surface. Post-growth annealing dissociates Vn-related complexes activating the p-type conductivity. Also the vacancy profile is made homogeneous by thermal treatment in highly Mg-doped GaN. The direct experimental evidence of oxygen decorated Ga vacancy is obtained in O-doped n-type GaN. The present study shows that VGa-ON is distinguishable from an isolated Ga vacancy by positron annihilation spectroscopy. Yellow luminescence (YL) is common in n-type GaN, which is usually related to Ga vacancy defects. However, carbon doped semi-insulating GaN is exhibiting strong YL emission, but without the presence of Ga vacancies. The YL is attributed to C interstitials. The investigations concerning silicon doped GaN and GaN grown by the mass-transport method reveal vacancy type defects, which were identified as vacancy clusters. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|A {{semiconductor}} {{with a high}} resistivity due to a {{deep trap}} is called a semi-insulator. A semi-insulator does not always behave like a normal insulator because of so-called bias voltage propagation, which arises from space charge in the deep trap. This effect {{is a factor in}} the operation of various devices based on semi-insulators. We investigate by numerical simulation its role in the transient photoresponse of a planar metal photodetector. We simulate a realistic case where the active layer is InGaAs made semi-insulating by addition of Fe. The simulation uses a two-dimensional, drift/diffusion calculation with realistic conditions where the semi-insulating material is represented by a two-level compensation model with Fe as a deep acceptor that <b>compensates</b> shallow n-type <b>impurities.</b> The results give a microscopic picture on a picosecond time scale of factors that affect the transient response: trapping, space charge, propagation of the bias field, and the spatial distribution of the carriers.

The experimental results show that, using gold as a <b>compensating</b> deep level <b>impurity</b> in silicon, a resistivity of 180 kΩ cm is achieved in this work. Sufficiently high resistivity substrates for microwave applications are obtained by depositing gold on silicon and annealing for 1 h at 1000 °C.

At 1000 °C, the diffusivity of gold in plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited silicon nitride is ∼ 3. 7 × 10 - 13 cm 2 s- 1, whereas for silicon dioxide, it is less than 6 × 10 - 14 cm 2 s- 1. These results imply that silicon nitride would be ineffective as a diffusion barrier in the SI-Si technology but that a 600 nm thick buried silicon dioxide might allow devices to be processed with a thermal budget of up to 15 h at 1000 °C without impurity contamination. © 2010 The Electrochemical Society...|$|R

Both devices successfully employ massive gas injection to mitigate disruption forces and power loads to PFCs by radiating up to 100 % of the available energy.
