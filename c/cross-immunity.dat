50|$|The first {{recognized}} dengue epidemics occurred almost {{simultaneously in}} Asia, Africa, and North America in the 1780s, {{shortly after the}} identification and naming of the disease in 1779. A pandemic began in Southeast Asia in the 1950s, and by 1975 DHF had become {{a leading cause of}} death among children in the region. The first case of DHF was reported in Manila, Philippines around 1953 through 1954. A small child with dengue fever started to bleed uncontrollably. Other children then became victims to the new symptom. Epidemic dengue has become more common since the 1980s. By the late 1990s, dengue was the most important mosquito-borne disease affecting humans after malaria, with around 40 million cases of dengue fever and several hundred thousand cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever each year.Significant outbreaks of dengue fever tend to occur every five or six months. The cyclical rise and fall in numbers of dengue cases is thought {{to be the result of}} seasonal cycles interacting with a short-lived <b>cross-immunity</b> for all four strains in people who have had dengue. When the <b>cross-immunity</b> wears off the population is more susceptible to transmission whenever the next seasonal peak occurs. Thus over time there remain large numbers of susceptible people in affected populations despite previous outbreaks due to the four different serotypes of dengue virus and the presence of unexposed individuals from childbirth or immigration.|$|E
50|$|Hammondia hammondi is {{a species}} of obligate heteroxenous {{parasitic}} alveolates of domestic cats (final host). Intracellular cysts develop mainly in striated muscle. After the ingestion of cysts by cats, a multiplicative cycle precedes the development of gametocytes in the epithelium of the small intestine (each oocyst of the species averaging 11×13 μm). Oocyst shedding persists for 10 to 28 days followed by immunity. Cysts in skeletal muscle measure between 100 and 340 μm in length and 40 and 95 μm in width. Some of the intermediate hosts (guinea pigs, hamsters, etc. studied) develop low levels of antibody and some <b>cross-immunity</b> against Toxoplasma.|$|E
50|$|Forward simulation-based {{approaches}} for addressing how immune selection can shape the phylogeny of influenza A/H3N2's hemagglutinin protein have been actively developed by disease modelers {{since the early}} 2000s.These approaches include both compartmental models and agent-based models.One of the first compartmental models for influenza was developed by Gog and Grenfell, who simulated the dynamics of many strains with partial <b>cross-immunity</b> to one another.Under a parameterization of long host lifespan and short infectious period, they found that strains would form self-organized sets that would emerge and replace one another.Although the authors did not reconstruct a phylogeny from their simulated results, the dynamics they found were consistent with a ladder-like viral phylogeny exhibiting low strain diversity and rapid lineage turnover.|$|E
50|$|As {{discussed}} above, it {{is possible}} to directly infer parameters of simple compartmental epidemiological models, such as SIR models, from sequence data by looking at genealogical patterns.Additionally, general patterns of geographic movement can be inferred from sequence data, but these inferences do not involve an explicit model of transmission dynamics between infected individuals.For more complicated epidemiological models, such as those involving <b>cross-immunity,</b> age structure of host contact rates, seasonality, or multiple host populations with different life history traits, it is often impossible to analytically predict genealogical patterns from epidemiological parameters.As such, the traditional statistical inference machinery will not work with these more complicated models, and in this case, it is common to instead use a forward simulation-based approach.|$|E
50|$|Later work by Ferguson {{and colleagues}} adopted an {{agent-based}} approach to better identify the immunological and ecological determinants of influenza evolution.The authors modeled influenza's hemagglutinin as four epitopes, each consisting of three amino acids.They showed that under strain-specific immunity alone (with partial <b>cross-immunity</b> between strains {{based on their}} amino acid similarity), the phylogeny of influenza A/H3N2's HA was expected to exhibit 'explosive genetic diversity', a pattern that is inconsistent with empirical data.This led the authors to postulate {{the existence of a}} temporary strain-transcending immunity: individuals were immune to reinfection with any other influenza strain for approximately six months following an infection.With this assumption, the agent-based model could reproduce the ladder-like phylogeny of influenza A/H3N2's HA protein.|$|E
5000|$|The {{notion of}} a weak form of a disease causing {{immunity}} to the virulent version was not new; this had been {{known for a long}} time for smallpox. Inoculation with smallpox (variolation) was known to result in far less scarring, and greatly reduced mortality, in comparison with the naturally acquired disease. The English physician Edward Jenner (1749-1823) had also discovered (1796) the process of vaccination by using cowpox to give <b>cross-immunity</b> to smallpox and by Pasteur's time this had generally replaced the use of actual smallpox material in inoculation. The difference between smallpox vaccination and anthrax or chicken cholera vaccination was that the weakened form of the latter two disease organisms had been [...] "generated artificially", so a naturally weak form of the disease organism did not need to be found. This discovery revolutionized work in infectious diseases and Pasteur gave these artificially weakened diseases the generic name [...] "vaccines", in honor of Jenner's groundbreaking discovery. In 1885, Pasteur produced his celebrated first vaccine for rabies by growing the virus in rabbits and then weakening it by drying the affected nerve tissue.|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{degree of}} <b>cross-immunity</b> between human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) types is fundamental {{both to the}} epidemiological dynamics of HPV and {{to the impact of}} HPV vaccination. Epidemiological data on HPV infections has been repeatedly interpreted as inconsistent with <b>cross-immunity.</b> Methods. We reevaluate the epidemiological data using a model to determine the odds ratios of multiple to single infections expected in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>cross-immunity.</b> We simulate a virtual longitudinal survey to determine the effect <b>cross-immunity</b> has on the prevalence of multiple infections. We calibrate our model to epide-miological data and estimate the extent of type replacement following vaccination against specific HPV types. Results. We find that <b>cross-immunity</b> can produce odds ratios of infection comparable with epidemiological observations. We show that the sample sizes underlying existing surveys have been insufficient to identify even intense <b>cross-immunity.</b> We also find that the removal of HPV type 16, type 18, and types 6 and 11 would increase the prevalence of nontargeted types by 50 %, 29 %, and 183 %, respectively. Conclusions. <b>Cross-immunity</b> between HPV types is consistent with epidemiological data, contrary to previous interpretations. <b>Cross-immunity</b> may cause significant type replacement following vaccination, and therefore should be considered in future vaccine studies and epidemiological models.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{tested the}} hypothesis, first {{proposed}} by Chaussinand, that individual-level immunity acquired {{from exposure to}} tuberculosis {{may have contributed to}} the disappearance of leprosy from western Europe. METHODS: The epidemiological consequences of <b>cross-immunity</b> were assessed by the formulation of a mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis and leprosy. RESULTS: The conditions under which Mycobacterium tuberculosis could have eradicated Mycobacterium leprae were derived in terms of the basic reproductive rates of the two infections and the degree of <b>cross-immunity.</b> CONCLUSIONS: If the degree of <b>cross-immunity</b> between two diseases within an individual is known, then the epidemiological consequences of this <b>cross-immunity</b> can be assessed with transmission modeling. The results of this analysis, in combination with previous estimates of the basic reproductive rate of tuberculosis and degree of <b>cross-immunity,</b> imply that tuberculosis could have contributed to the decline of leprosy if the basic reproductive rate of leprosy was low...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a general framework {{to study the}} dynamics of multiple strain pathogens that can impart <b>cross–immunity</b> {{through a variety of}} structures. We propose two types of immunity and apply them to assess the dynamics of two competing strains. We illustrate this framework using two “visions”: the next–to–kin protection (NTKP) approach which assumes that strains confer <b>cross–immunity</b> to next in order (neighboring) strains, while providing no protection against all other strains; and the differential protection (DP) approach assumes that individuals randomly gain partial (may be reinfected) and full <b>cross-immunity</b> following an infection with respective probabilities. We show that the risk of infection with a particular strain is significantly higher in the DP model that the NKTP. Moreover, we demonstrate that weaker <b>cross-immunity</b> structures in these models are more likely to lead to instability (sustained oscillations) in the strain coexistence mode. That is, periodic oscillations are sustained in the two-strain DP model for intermediate to weak levels of <b>cross-immunity,</b> while the NTKP model requires at least three strains to support these unstable dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of influenza A virus {{is linked to}} a non-fixed evolutionary landscape driven by tight co-evolutionary interactions between hosts and influenza strains. Herd-immunity, <b>cross-immunity</b> and age-structure are among the factors shown to support the coexistence of multiple strain oscillations. In this study, we incorporate two influenza strains and allow for levels of <b>cross-immunity</b> supported by previous studies. Three specific pairs of strain interactions are considered. Some of the strain definitions can be extended to n interacting strains if strains are properly defined. This framework allows for a biologically interpretable approach since appropriate levels of <b>cross-immunity</b> as suggested by each strain definition can be applied. We show that strong <b>cross-immunity</b> along with reasonable periods of host isolation lead to periodic epidemic outbreaks (sustained oscillations). We establish the system's stability {{in the absence of}} infection via the basic reproductive number (Ro). The presence of two boundary endemic equilibria is found analytically. For isolation periods and <b>cross-immunity</b> levels pertaining to the influenza virus, our system supports the existence of sustained oscillations.

40|$|Infection by one {{strain of}} {{influenza}} type A provides some protection (<b>cross-immunity)</b> against infection by a related strain. It {{is important to}} determine how this influences the observed co-circulation of comparatively minor variants of the H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 subtypes. To this end, we formulate discrete and continuous time models with two viral strains, <b>cross-immunity,</b> age structure, and infectious disease dynamics. Simulation and analysis of models with <b>cross-immunity</b> indicate that sustained oscillations cannot be maintained by age-specific infection activity level rates when the mortality rate is constant; but are possible if mortalities are age-specific, even if activity levels are independent of age. Sustained oscillations do not seem possible for a single-strain model, even {{in the presence of}} age-specific mortali-ties; and thus it is suggested that the interplay between <b>cross-immunity</b> and age-specific mortalities may underlie observed oscillations. 1...|$|E

Numerical simulations of a discrete version gave rise to sustained oscillators provided that age structure, two co-circulating viral strains, and <b>cross-immunity</b> was included. The hypothesis that the interaction between <b>cross-immunity</b> and age dependent survivorship may be enough to drive sustained oscillations.

We illustrate an approach using a dataset describing co-infections by several strains of bacteria circulating within a population of cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus).

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{dynamics}} of antigenically diverse infectious agents using a mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics of arbitrary numbers of pathogen strains, interacting via <b>cross-immunity,</b> and {{in the presence of}} mutations generating new strains and stochastic extinctions of existing ones. Equilibrium dynamics fall into three classes depending on <b>cross-immunity,</b> transmissibility and host population size: systems where global extinction is likely, stable single-strain persistence, and multiple-strain persistence with stable diversity. Where multi-strain dynamics are stable, a diversity threshold region separates a low-prevalence, low-diversity region of parameter space from a high-diversity, high-prevalence region. The location of the threshold region is determined by the reproduction number of the pathogen and the intensity of <b>cross-immunity,</b> with the sharpness of the transition being determined by the manner in which immunity accrues with repeated infections. Host population size and <b>cross-immunity</b> are found to be the most decisive factors in determining pathogen diversity. While the model framework developed is simplified, we show that it can capture essential aspects of the complex evolutionary dynamics of pathogens such as influenza...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} a time-delayed epidemic model for multi-strain diseases with temporary immunity. In {{the absence of}} <b>cross-immunity</b> between strains, dynamics of each individual strain exhibits emergence and anni- hilation of limit cycles due to a Hopf bifurcation of the endemic equilibrium, and a saddle-node bifurcation of limit cycles depending on the time delay associated with duration of temporary immunity. Effects of all-to-all and non-local coupling topologies are systematically investigated by means of numerical simulations, and they suggest that <b>cross-immunity</b> is able to induce a diverse range of complex dynamical behaviors and synchro- nization patterns, including discrete traveling waves, solitary states, and amplitude chimeras.

40|$|Incidence of {{whooping}} cough, {{an infection}} caused by Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis, {{has been on}} the rise since the 1980 s in many countries. Immunological interactions, such as immune boosting and <b>cross-immunity</b> between pathogens, have been hypothesised to be important drivers of epidemiological dynamics. We present a two-pathogen model of transmission which examines how immune boosting and <b>cross-immunity</b> can influence the timing and severity of epidemics. We use a combination of numerical simulations and bifurcation techniques to study the dynamical properties of the system, particularly the conditions under which stable periodic solutions are present. We derive analytic expressions for the steady state of the single-pathogen model, and give a condition for the presence of periodic solutions. A key result from our two-pathogen model is that, while studies have shown that immune boosting at relatively strong levels can independently generate periodic solutions, <b>cross-immunity</b> allows for the presence of periodic solutions even when the level of immune boosting is weak. Asymmetric <b>cross-immunity</b> can produce striking increases in the incidence and period.

40|$|Abstract. The time {{evolution}} of the influenza A virus is linked to a nonfixed landscape driven by interactions between hosts and competing influenza strains. Herd-immunity, <b>cross-immunity,</b> and age-structure are among the factors that {{have been shown to}} support strain coexistence and/or disease oscillations. In this study, we put two influenza strains under various levels of (interference) competition. We establish that <b>cross-immunity</b> and host isolation lead to periodic epidemic outbreaks (sustained oscillations) in this multistrain system. We compute the isolation reproductive number for each strain (i) independently, {{as well as for the}} full system (q), and show that when q < 1, both strains die out. Subthreshold coexistence driven by <b>cross-immunity</b> is possible even when the isolation reproductive number of one strain is below 1. Conditions that guarantee a winning type or coexistence are established in general. Oscillatory coexistence is established via Hopf bifurcation theory and confirmed via numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} phase {{variation}} is {{a mechanism for}} immune evasion. However, despite fimbrial phase variation, mice previously exposed to Salmonella typhimurium are protected against a subsequent challenge. We evaluated whether lpf phase variation instead may be a mechanism to evade <b>cross-immunity</b> between Salmonella serotypes. Mice were immunized orally with S. typhimurium aroA mutants either that expressed the lpf operon (phase-on variant) or in which the entire lpf operon had been removed by deletion. During a subsequent challenge with virulent Salmonella enteritidis a selection against lpf phase-on variants was observed in mice previously exposed to S. typhimurium long polar fimbriae. Vaccination with S. typhimurium did not confer protection against challenge with S. enteritidis, presumably because lpf phase-off variants were able to evade <b>cross-immunity.</b> We propose that lpf phase variation is a mechanism to evade <b>cross-immunity</b> between Salmonella serotypes, thereby allowing their coexistence in a host population...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we use {{bifurcation}} theory to analyze three multi-strain compartmental models, motivated by dengue fever epidemiology. The models are {{extensions of the}} classical SIR model where the notion of two different strains is needed to describe primary and secondary infections. Ferguson et al. formulate and analyzed in Ferguson et al. (1999) [1] a two-strain model with Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ade), where the pre-existing antibodies to previous dengue infection cannot neutralize but rather enhance the new infection. No <b>cross-immunity</b> is assumed and therefore co-infection is possible and moreover individuals can belong to multiple compartments. In the modeling approach proposed by Billings et al. in (2007) [2] cross-infection is not possible as long as an individual is primarily infected. As a result all compartments are distinct. In the third model Aguiar et al. (2011) [9] starting from the Billings et al. model, temporary <b>cross-immunity</b> is introduced by additional compartments for the recovered from the primary infection. The study of the different models gives insight into how different long-term dynamic behavior originate. We use the same parameter set for all models, except {{the duration of the}} <b>cross-immunity</b> period in the last model which will be a bifurcation parameter. Another bifurcation parameter is the ade factor. Besides endemic equilibria and periodic solutions there is also chaotic behavior originating via different routes. Numerical bifurcation analysis, Lyapunov exponent calculation and simulation techniques (quantitative results) as well as symbolic analysis (qualitative results) are used to unravel the different types of long-term dynamics. When the <b>cross-immunity</b> period is moderately long or short the predictions show, besides similar chaotic dynamics as in the two models without temporal <b>cross-immunity,</b> a new chaotic attractor with a different origin...|$|E
40|$|Centre de Recerca MatemàticaIn {{the last}} twenty years, a {{considerable}} amount of research has been done in order to mathematically study the dynamics of viruses and immunity, and HIV in particular. The aim of this thesis is to further develop a mathematical model of within-host dynamics of HIV, which incorporates random mutations and postulates that immune response is phenotype specic. In this model, a continuous distribution of viral strains in a one-dimensional strain space is assumed, and random mutations are modelled by diusion in this space. This model shows that for a fast evolving virus the phenotype specic immune response is not able to clear HIV from its host. In this thesis, we develop the model further by including <b>cross-immunity,</b> rather than specic immunity, modelled by a weight function which represents the broadness of the <b>cross-immunity.</b> Numerical simulations show that if <b>cross-immunity</b> is suciently broad, CTL response is able to clear a virus from its host...|$|E
40|$|Strain {{structure}} is of fundamental {{importance in the}} underlying dynamics {{of a number of}} pathogens. However, previous models have been too complex to accommodate many strains. This paper offers a solution to this problem, {{in the form of a}} simple model that is capable of capturing the dynamics of a large number of antigenic types that interact via host <b>cross-immunity.</b> We derive the structure of the model, which can manage the complexity of many strains by using a status-based formulation, assuming polarized immunity and <b>cross-immunity</b> act to reduced transmission probability. We then apply the model to address basic questions in strain dynamics, focusing particularly on the interpandemic dynamics of influenza. This model shows that strains have a tendency to “cluster. ” For a long infectious period, relative to host lifetime, clusters may coexist. By contrast, a short infectious period leads to a single dominant cluster at any given time.
