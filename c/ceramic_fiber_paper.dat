The robot is designed and manufactured {{to go in the}} middle of fire, extinguish it and send images from incident area by using a camera to increase knowledge about fire behavior. This robot makes it possible to extinguish fire without spreading in the shortest time. This will reduce the risk of injury and number of casualties for firefighters {{as well as for the}} possible victims. The robot can also decrease the monetary losses which increase considerably as fire duration increases. For designing the fireproof fire rescue robot three dimensional solid modeling computer program was used. The semi-autonomous robot is powered by two DC electric actuators. It goes on the ground with tracking system which is manufactured by using sprockets and chains. To prevent possible damages that may be incurred by heat, the robot was covered with a <b>ceramic</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>paper</b> that has very low thermal conductivity. In addition to mechanical design of the fireproof fire rescue robot, two electronic circuits are mounted in order to control actuators and solenoid valve of the extinguisher. Furthermore, in order to control actions of the robot remotely by the operator, two remote controls are used at different frequencies. As a result of this thesis; a fireproof fire rescue robot is designed and manufactured to be used in fire incidents. Also some ideas were expressed to improve the fireproof fire rescue robot by gained experience throughout the thesis...|$|E

It has the potential contribution of improving the rutting resistance and temperature sensitivity of modified asphalt binder by proper modification design. In this research, <b>ceramic</b> <b>fiber</b> was introduced into both pen 60 / 80 and pen 80 / 100 asphalt binder by different weight ratios. An asphalt penetration test, softening point test, ductility test and dynamic viscoelastic behavior were conducted to characterize and predict the <b>ceramic</b> <b>fiber</b> modified asphalt mortar (CFAM).

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of fiberglass and <b>ceramic</b> <b>fiber</b> cylinders as root-pass weld backing for a double-V groove in 16 mm-thick carbon steel. Three different cylinder diameters were tested: 4. 8, 9. 5 mm (fiberglass) and 6. 4 mm (<b>ceramic</b> <b>fiber).</b> The welding process used was GMAW. The welding technique and the following process variables were investigated: root opening, current and travel speed. The results show that cylindrical fiberglass and <b>ceramic</b> <b>fiber</b> backings not only have excellent refractory properties, but also seal the root opening and contain the weld pool sufficiently to produce a root bead free of discontinuities and with a satisfactory shape and geometry. Working points were defined, together with a possible operating range for the welding parameters. It was concluded that cylindrical fiberglass and <b>ceramic</b> <b>fiber</b> weld backings hold great promise for use in root-pass welds in double-V grooves in applications in the naval and metallurgical industry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Ceramic</b> <b>fibers</b> were {{functionalized}} by the {{sputter coating}} of copper in this study. The surface and interface {{structures of the}} functionalized <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibers</b> were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and environmental scanning electron micro-scopy (ESEM). The observations by AFM revealed the formation of nanoclusters on the fiber surface. The coated layer of the sputtered copper was also confirmed by the ESEM examination, equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. It was {{also found that the}} electrical resistance of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibers</b> decreased with increased coating thickness. The interfacial bonding between fibrous substrate and sputter-coated copper was investigated and discussed by peel-off tests in this study.

40|$|The {{strengths}} of <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibers</b> {{have been observed}} to increase with decreasing fiber diameter and length. The traditional single-modal Weibull distribution function can only take into account one type of flaw, which makes it inappropriate to characterize the strength dependence of both the diameter and the length since <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibers</b> usually have both volume and surface flaws which affect the strength dependence in different ways. Although the bi-modal Weibull distribution {{can be used to}} characterize both volume and surface flaws, the mathematical difficulty in its application makes it undesirable. In this paper, the factors affecting fiber strength are analyzed in terms of fracture mechanics and flaw formation. A modified Weibull distribution function is proposed to characterize both the diameter dependence and the length dependence of <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibers...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{test program}} to {{determine}} the friction and wear properties of two complex carbide oxide <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibers</b> for high temperature sliding seal applications is described. The fibers are based on Si, C, O, and Ti or Si, C, N, and O ceramic systems. Pin on disk tests using <b>ceramic</b> <b>fiber</b> covered pins and Inconel 718 disks, were conducted in air from 25 to 900 C to evaluate potential seal materials. This testing procedure was used in a previous study of oxide <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibers</b> which were found to exhibit wear behavior based predominantly on their mechanical properties. Like the oxide fibers tested previously, these carbide oxide <b>ceramic</b> <b>fibers,</b> show an increase in friction and wear with increased test temperature. At room temperature, the wear behavior seems to be based upon mechanical properties, namely tensile strength. At 500 and especially 900 C, the fibers wear by both mechanical fracture and by oxidative type wear. Based upon post test microscopic and x ray analyses, interaction between the fiber constituents and elements transferred from the counterface, namely Ni and Cr, may have occurred enhancing the tribochemical wear process. These results are interpreted...|$|R

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of nano <b>ceramic</b> <b>fiber</b> fillers on the physical properties of VST- 50 HD silicone maxillofacial prosthesis. Nano alumina fibers at 2 percent, 4 -percent, and 6 -percent wt were mixed into the VST- 50 HD silicone elastomer (Factor II Inc., Lakeside, AZ), a commercially-available poly(dimethylsiloxanes). Ten dumb-bell-shaped specimens were used to determine the tensile strength according to ISO 37 : 2005 and elongation at fracture. Ten trouser-shaped test pieces were used to determine the tear resistance according to ISO 34 - 1 : 2004. Shore A test method was used to measure the hardness of the material. The data collected from all quantitative studies of the modified silicones were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with concentration of nano <b>ceramic</b> <b>fiber</b> as the main variable. Specimens from VST- 50 HD were also made and tested as control. Results: The mean values for tensile strength (MPa) of control group, 2 -percent, 4 -percent, and 6 -percent reinforced nano <b>ceramic</b> <b>fiber</b> fillers were from 3. 43 ± 0. 12 to 5. 48 ± 0. 71.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this CRADA between Lockheed Martin and Cummins Engine Company was to develop fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (SiC) composite materials for use as diesel engine particulate traps. Chemical vapor deposition techniques were used to partially densify and rigidize a thin fibrous substrate and produce the porous SiC- based filter. Microwave energy was used to directly couple to the deposited SiC to uniformly heat the filter and oxidize the collected carbon particulates. For commercial usage particulate traps must: (1) filter carbon particulates from a high temperature diesel exhaust at an acceptably low backpressure, (2) survive thousands of thermal transients due to regeneration or cleaning of the filter by oxidizing the collected carbon, (3) be durable and reliable over the expected life of the filter (300, 000 miles or 10, 000 hours), and (4) provide a low overall operating cost which is competitive with other filtering techniques. The development efforts performed {{as part of this}} CRADA have resulted in a very promising new technology for Cummins Engine Company. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>fiber</b> based filter <b>papers</b> were developed at Fleetguard, Inc., (a Cummins Subsidiary) and used to produce the spiral wound, corrugated filter cartridges.
