The excavators at nearby Tell Leilan (ancient Shekhna/Shubat-Enlil) have used the results from their investigations to argue that the Akkadian Empire came to an end due to a sudden drought, the so-called 4.2 kiloyear event.

Since the 20 th century,many extreme <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> such as droughts,floods,hurricanes and dust storms have taken place,which could not be explained only by the increasing of greenhouse gas,and the conclusion that the frequency and intensity of extreme <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> would increase along with the global warming still remains uncertain.

First, we evaluate {{the effect of a}} large iceberg discharge originating from the decaying Laurentide ice sheet on ocean circulation, compared to a release of an identical volume of freshwater alone. Our results show that, on top of the freshwater effect, a large iceberg discharge facilitates sea-ice growth as a result of lower sea-surface temperatures induced by latent heat of melting. This causes an 8 % increased sea-ice cover, 5 % stronger reduction in North Atlantic Deep Water production and 1 °C lower temperature in Greenland. Second, we use the model to {{investigate the}} effect of a hypothetical two-stage lake drainage, which is suggested by several investigators to have triggered the 8. 2 ka <b>climate</b> <b>event.</b> To account for the final collapse of the ice-dam holding the Laurentide Lakes we accompany the secondary freshwater pulse in one scenario with a fast 5 -year iceberg discharge and in a second scenario with a slow 100 -year iceberg discharge.

There were three migratory peaks during the upsurge of migration, which corresponded to the three drought events. The peaks of migration, however, often lagged behind the drought events about 1 - 2 years. The encouraging-migration policy, which was adopted to encourage cultivation in Northeast China, did not produce much migration into the region in the early Cling Dynasty. It did, however, provide a policy background, which ensured more than 10000 migrants per year to Northeast China when North China suffered from drought/flood disasters. As a response to the highest peak of migration induced by the severe droughts in North China during 1664 - 1667, a prohibiting-migration policy restricted further migration to Northeast China was carried out in 1668.
