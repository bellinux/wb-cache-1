In a double blind trial, four individuals visually examined identical Cigua-Check® strips to conclude whether the samples were positive or negative for ciguatera. Of the 121 samples that were shown to be positively ciguatoxic via bioassay, the four strip readers were in agreement in concluding positive <b>ciguateric</b> status in 9. 9 % of the samples; these four readers concluded these positive samples were negative for ciguatera in 26. 2 % of these bioassay-positive samples.

40|$|ReviewCiguatera is {{the most}} common food {{poisoning}} found in the tropical and subtropical areas, acquired by the consumption of marine products. A lot of work concerning its etiology, its epidemiology and its clinical effects, as well as the discovery of the toxins involved, the description of their transfer, the study of their structure and the analysis of their pharmacological effects, have allowed {{a better understanding of the}} <b>ciguateric</b> phenomenon. Ciguatera is known to be due to benthic dinoflagellates belonging to the Gambierdiscus gender, in particular G. toxicus.

However, the factors supporting this production are still poorly known, and the implication of others dinoflagellates, cyanophytes or bacteria have been suspected. In contrast, the fish species responsible for the transmission of ciguatera are globally well identified. The clinical symptoms of the intoxication are now well described. They mainly include digestive, neurological and cardiovascular disorders whose preponderance varies according to the nature of the toxins involved, since toxin structures are different between one ocean and the other. The <b>ciguateric</b> intoxication tends to be exported towards non endemic areas where it is still misdiagnosed.

However, analytical reversed phase HPLC coupled to an electrospray mass spectrometry detector identified a [M + H](+) ion at m/z 1141. 58 which co-eluted with activity that displaced [3 H]-PbTx binding to rat brain. This mass corresponded to C-CTX- 1, but the fragmentation pattern of I-CTX showed a different ratio of pseudo molecular and product ions. I-CTX was found to elute later than P-CTX- 1 but was practically indistinguishable from C-CTX- 1 on reversed phase HPLC, while the TSK HW- 40 S column chromatography differentiated I-CTX from the later eluting C-CTX- 1.

40|$|Background: Ciguatera fish {{poisoning}} (CFP) is {{a significant}} public health problem due to dinoflagellates. It is responsible {{for one of the}} highest reported incidence of seafood-borne illness and Groupers are commonly reported as a source of CFP due to their position in the food chain.

Since there is no appropriate treatment for CFP, the most efficient solution is to regulate fish consumption.

Sampling of tidal ponds on rocky shores of this archipelago has revealed an unexpected diversity of the genus Gambierdiscus in the area. Morphological and phylogenetic studies of culture isolates established the presence {{of at least three}} different species: G. excentricus (originally described in the Canaries), G. australes, and a third species soon to be formally characterized, with close characteristics to G. polynesiensis and Gambierdiscus sp. type 4 sensu Xu et al (2014). The evaluation of toxicity in these species was performed by mouse bioassay (MBA) and erythrocyte lyses assay (ELA).

40|$|Ciguatera fish {{poisoning}} (CFP) is {{a global}} foodborne illness caused by consumption of seafood containing ciguatoxins (CTXs) originating from dinoflagellates such as Gambierdiscus toxicus.

In this paper, we describe a sensitive and rapid extraction method using accelerated solvent extraction combined with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for the detection and quantification of P-CTX- 1 in fish flesh. By the use of a more sensitive MS system (5500 QTRAP), the validated method has a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0. 01 μg/kg, linearity correlation coefficients above 0. 99 for both solvent- and matrix-based standard solutions as well as matrix spike recoveries ranging from 49 % to 85 % in 17 coral reef fish species. Compared with previous methods, this method has better overall recovery, extraction efficiency and LOQ. Fish flesh from 12 blue-spotted groupers (Cephalopholis argus) was assessed for the presence of CTXs using HPLC-MS/MS analysis and the commonly used mouse neuroblastoma assay, and the results of the two methods were strongly correlated.

40|$|Ciguatera fish {{poisoning}} (CFP) occurs mainly when humans ingest finfish {{contaminated with}} ciguatoxins (CTXs).

Selecting any of these methodological approaches for routine monitoring of ciguatera may be dependent upon the applicability of the method. However, identifying a reference validation method for CTXs is a critical and urgent issue, and is dependent upon the availability of certified CTX standards and the coordinated action of laboratories. Reports of CFP cases in European hospitals have been described in several countries, and are mostly due to travel to CFP endemic areas. Additionally, the recent detection of the CTX-producing tropical genus Gambierdiscus in the eastern Atlantic Ocean of the northern hemisphere and in the Mediterranean Sea, as well as the confirmation of CFP in the Canary Islands and possibly in Madeira, constitute other reasons to study the onset of CFP in Europe [1].

40|$|Ciguatera fish {{poisoning}} is a seafood intoxication commonly afflicting island {{communities in}} the Pacific. These populations, which are strongly dependent on fish resources, have developed over centuries various strategies to decrease the risk of intoxication, {{including the use of}} folk tests to detect <b>ciguateric</b> fish. This study aims {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} two folk tests commonly used in Raivavae Island (Australes, French Polynesia) : the rigor mortis test (RMT) and the bleeding test (BT). A total of 107 fish were collected in Raivavae Lagoon, among which 80 were tested by five testers using the RMT versus 107 tested by four testers using BT. First, the performance between testers was compared. Second, the efficiency of these tests was compared with toxicity data obtained via the receptor binding assay (RBA) by assessing various parameter's values such as sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Comparisons of outcomes between folk tests and RBA analyses were considered: tests used separately or in a parallel versus the series approach by each tester. The overall efficiency of the RMT and BT tests was also evaluated when the judgments of all testers were pooled. The results demonstrate that efficiencies varied between testers with one showing the best scores in detecting toxic fish: 55 % with RMT and 69. 2 % with BT. BT gave the best results in detecting toxic fish as compared with RMT, giving also better agreement between testers. If high NPV and Se values were to be privileged, the data also suggest that the best way to limit cases of intoxication would be to use RMT and BT tests in a parallel approach. The use of traditional knowledge and a good knowledge of risky versus healthy fishing areas may help reduce the risk of intoxication among communities where ciguatera fish poisoning is highly prevalent...|$|E
40|$|The toxins {{involved}} in ciguatera (fish poisoning) in the Caribbean Sea were isolated from Caranx latus, a pelagic fish often implicated in ciguatera in the Caribbean region, and purified by mouse bioassay directed fractionation. Five toxins {{were separated by}} reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In order of increasing hydrophobicity, these toxins included a sleep-inducing fraction (< 1 % of total toxicity), a major Caribbean ciguatoxin (C-CTX- 1, 65 % of toxicity), a minor Caribbean ciguatoxin (C-CTX- 2, 13 % of toxicity), a minor toxin (similar to 1 % of toxicity) and a hydrophobic, fast-acting toxin (similar to 19 % of toxicity), The i. p. injection into mice of each toxin induced signs typical of site- 5 sodium channel activator toxins such as the Pacific ciguatoxins and brevetoxins, C-CTX- 1 and C-CTX- 2 were purified to homogeneity (LD 50 = 3. 6 and similar to 1 mu g/kg, respectively) and subjected to ionspray mass spectrometry. Both lost up to five H 2 O molecules and each had a [M + H](+) ion, m/z 1141. 7, suggesting that C-CTX- 1 and - 2 are diastereomers that differ from the Pacific family of ciguatoxins. Turbo-assisted HPLC-mass spectrometry identified C-CTX- 1, C-CTX- 2 and three C-CTX- 1 -related compounds in an enriched fraction but no Pacific ciguatoxins were detected. The presence of different families of ciguatoxins in <b>ciguateric</b> fish from the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean probably underlies the clinical differences in the ciguatera syndrome reported in these two regions, A Caribbean strain of the benthic dinoflagellate, Gambierdiscus toxicus, is suspected as source of these ciguatoxins. The {{extent to which these}} toxins are biotransformed as they pass through the marine food chain remains to be determined. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Ciguatera is an {{important}} form of human poisoning caused by the consumption of seafood. The disease is characterised by gastrointestinal, neurological and cardiovascular disturbances. In cases of severe toxicity, paralysis, coma and death may occur. There is no immunity, and the toxins are cumulative. Symptoms may persist for months or years, or recur periodically. The epidemiology of ciguatera is complex and of central importance to the management and future use of marine resources. Ciguatera is {{an important}} medical entity in tropical and subtropical Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, and in the tropical Caribbean. As reef fish are increasingly exported to other areas, {{it has become a}} world health problem. The disease is under-reported and often misdiagnosed. Lipid-soluble, polyether toxins known as ciguatoxins accumulated in the muscles of certain subtropical and tropical marine finfish cause ciguatera. Ciguatoxins arise from biotransformation in the fish of less polar ciguatoxins (gambiertoxins) produced by Gambierdiscus toxicus, a marine dinoflagellate that lives on macroalgae, usually attached to dead coral. The toxins and their metabolites are concentrated in the food chain when carnivorous fish prey on smaller herbivorous fish. Humans are exposed {{at the end of the}} food chain. More than 400 species of fish can be vectors of ciguatoxins, but generally only a relatively small number of species are regularly incriminated in ciguatera. <b>Ciguateric</b> fish look, taste and smell normal, and detection of toxins in fish remains a problem. More than 20 precursor gambiertoxins and ciguatoxins have been identified in G. toxicus and in herbivorous and carnivorous fish. The toxins become more polar as they undergo oxidative metabolism and pass up the food chain. The main Pacific ciguatoxin (P-CTX- 1) causes ciguatera at levels = 0. 1 mug/kg in the flesh of carnivorous fish. The main Caribbean ciguatoxin (C-CTX- 1) is less polar and 10 -fold less toxic than P-CTX- 1. Ciguatoxins activate sodium ion (Na(+)) channels, causing cell membrane excitability and instability. Worldwide coral bleaching is now well documented, and there is a strong association between global warming and the bleaching and death of coral. This, together with natural environmental factors such as earthquakes and hurricanes, and man-made factors such as tourism, dock construction, sewage and eutrophication, may create more favourable environments for G. toxicus. While low levels of G. toxicus are found throughout tropical and subtropical waters, the presence of bloom numbers is unpredictable and patchy. Only certain genetic strains produce ciguatoxins, and environmental triggers for increasing toxin production are unknown. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
