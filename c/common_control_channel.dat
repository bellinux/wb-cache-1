40|$|<b>Common</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> in {{cognitive}} radio (CR) ad hoc networks are spectrum resources temporarily allocated and commonly available to CR users for control message exchange. With no presumably available network infrastructure, CR users rely on cooperation to perform spectrum management functions. One the one hand, CR users need to cooperate to establish <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels,</b> {{but on the}} other hand, they need to have <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> to facilitate such cooperation. This <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> problem is further complicated by primary user (PU) activities, channel impairments, and intelligent attackers. Therefore, how to reliably and securely establish control links in CR ad hoc networks is a challenging problem. In this work, a framework for <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> design and analysis is proposed to address <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> reliability and security challenges for seamless communication and spectral efficiency in CR ad hoc networks. The framework tackles the problem from three perspectives: (i) responsiveness to PU activities: an efficient recovery <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> method is devised to efficiently establish control links and extend <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> coverage upon PU's return while mitigating the interference with PUs, (ii) robustness to channel impairments: a reinforcement learning-based cooperative sensing method is introduced to improve cooperative gain and mitigate cooperation overhead, and (iii) resilience to jamming attacks: a jamming-resilient <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> method is developed to combat jamming under the impacts of PU activities and spectrum sensing errors by leveraging intrusion defense strategies. This research is particularly attractive to emergency relief, public safety, military, and commercial applications where CR users are highly likely to operate in spectrum-scarce or hostile environment.

Each CCCH block can carry Paging Messages for 2 MS if IMSI based paging is used or 4 MS if TMSI based paging is used. Thus the paging capacity for one 51 TDMA frame Multi Frame will be 9(number of CCCH blocks available per Multi Frame) * 4 (when TMSI based paging is used) = 36 mobiles per 235 ms or 9*2 = 18 mobiles per 235 ms when IMSI based paging is used. Thus the paging capacity of a cell is 153 mobiles per second when TMSI based paging are used and 68 mobiles per second when IMSI based paging are used. This means we can improve the [...] "paging bandwidth" [...] for a cell (if {{there are too many}} [...] "paging discards at the cell level") by using TMSI based paging rather than IMSI based (at the expense of increased processor load at the BSC and MSC).

30|$|The {{properties}} of ad hoc networks {{must also be}} covered in designing routing protocols for CRAHNs. Node mobility encourages spectrum utilization variation not only in time domain but also in space domain. For the mobile SUs, the spectrum availability at the new location has to be immediately sensed. The adaptation of spectrum sensing result in real-time manner could be very challenging. Thus, efficient spectrum mobility procedure should be considered when designing the routing protocols for CRAHNs. Another characteristic of ad hoc networks is self-configuration. With {{the absence of a}} centralized body, all nodes should exchange network-related information in distributed manners via a <b>control</b> <b>channel,</b> so they could organize their data transmissions on the shared wireless medium with minimum transmission failure. In the cognitive radio network environment, the set of available spectrum bands might be different from node to node and might be scarce from time to time. Thus, dedicating some channels to be the <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> is a questionable implementation. Besides having to solve the <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> issue, routing protocols designed for CRAHNs should not assume bi-directional links.

Using a dedicated <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> simplifies the process of coordination among SUs. However, reliance on a dedicated <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> results in several limitations.

A sensing strategy for intelligent channel selection is crucial to track the rapidly varying spectrum opportunities. In an ad hoc network without a central controller or <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels,</b> a secondary user can only resort to its local observations in the decision making. The tradeoff is between choosing the channel {{most likely to be}} idle and avoiding other competing secondary users.

The SIR outage probability and the SIR cumulative distribution function (CDF) are important metrics for the performance evaluation of wireless communication systems.

This performance parameter is crucial for both coverage and capacity studies. In terms of coverage, mobile stations should be able to decode <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> (like pilots or broadcast channels) and thus to attain a certain SIR threshold on these channels with high probability. In this case, we {{are interested}} in the low SIR region of the SIR distribution in order to evaluate the cell coverage. In terms of capacity and for systems implementing link adaptation on shared downlink channels (such as HSPA or LTE), the whole SIR distribution is needed for performance evaluation. The ergodic capacity at a certain distance from the base station is indeed evaluated as an expectation of the Shannon classical formula over the channel variations. The cell capacity is obtained by integration over the cell area.|$|R

30|$|Heuristic {{approach}} {{encompasses a}} variety of schemes. One of the earliest heuristic approaches is the water-fill algorithm, first introduced in [21]. In this algorithm, the rate assignment is done in iterations. During each iteration, each user increases his transmission rate by a predefined amount. The process continues until the frequency-dependent power constraints imposed by PUs have been reached. It is proven that the algorithm converges to a Nash Equilibrium under certain conditions. This work is extended in [22], where a price-based iterative water-filling algorithm is proposed and implemented in a distributed fashion. It allows SUs to repeatedly negotiate their spectrum and transmission powers. In this approach, an SU selfishly adjusts his transmission power and his pricing factor based on the interference he observes locally in the hope to maximize his own utility function. This process is repeated for each SU. It is proven that the proposed algorithm will drive the SUs to a Nash equilibrium [23] to thoroughly evaluate this approach under an event-driven simulation environment. A biologically inspired spectrum sharing scheme is proposed in [24]. It {{is based on the}} adaptive task allocation model in insect colonies. The algorithm allows SUs to coordinate their decision making about what channels suit them the most hence avoiding channel handoff latency. Authors in [25] use swam intelligence to help neighboring SUs identify the suitable <b>common</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels.</b> These channels are then used by SUs to exchange information about the detected spectrum holes and coordinate their spectrum allocation efforts. An iterative heuristic algorithm, ELCI, is proposed in [26]. It maximizes the aggregated throughput in an interference-limited multi-channel CRN. The algorithm could produce the optimal solution and outperform the well-known global optimum algorithm MARL [27]. A heuristic-based adaptive resource allocation scheme is introduced in [28]. The scheme provides proportional fairness among SUs. Genetic algorithm is attempted in [29] that helps SUs select the optimal channels. Simulation results show that the algorithm significantly reduces the number of channel switchings, minimizes the delay, and saves the transmission power. Other noticeable works are a family of distributed spectrum sharing schemes [19, 20, 30 – 32]. In these schemes, operators announce the availability and quality of their spectrum bands and each SU makes his own decision about his spectrum access strategy.|$|R
