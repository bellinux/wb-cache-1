Duke Energy Generation Services (DEGS) operates and maintains the steam and electric generation equipment for Kodak and has {{primary responsibility for}} related capital project development and execution. The Kodak plant is capable of generating approximately 1, 900, 000 pounds of steam and 130 MW?s of electrical power. To achieve the required level of NOx control, Kodak chose The Babcock & Wilcox (B&W) Company's, Natural Gas Reburn technology for the three <b>cyclone</b> <b>boilers.</b> The relatively low capital cost {{of the system and}} reasonable cost of natural gas in the mid 1990 ?s made Natural Gas Reburn an economic fit for the RACT requirements of 0. 60 #?s/Mmbtu NOx.

40|$|The {{results from}} the GR-LNB {{technology}} demonstrated by EER at Cherokee Station approached, but did not meet, the CCT project's performance objectives. Acceptable unit operability was achieved with both the GR and the LNB components. The gas reburning component of the process appears to be broadly applicable for retrofit NO{sub x} control to most utility boilers and, in particular, to wet-bottom <b>cyclone</b> <b>boilers,</b> which are high NO{sub x} emitters and are difficult to control (LNB technology is not applicable to <b>cyclone</b> <b>boilers).</b> GR-LNB can reduce NO{sub x} to mandated emissions levels under Title IV of the CAAA without significant, adverse boiler impacts. The GR-LNB process may be applicable to boilers significantly larger than the demonstration unit, provided there is adequate dispersion and mixing of injected natural gas. Major results of the demonstration project are summarized as follows: NO{sub x}-emissions reductions averaging 64 % were achieved with 12. 5 % gas heat input in long-term tests on a 158 -MWe (net) wall-fired unit. The target reduction level of 70 % was achieved only on a short-term basis with higher gas consumption. The thermal performance of coal-fired boilers is not significantly affected by GR-LNB. Convective section steam temperatures can be controlled within acceptable limits. Thermal efficiency is decreased by a small amount (about 0. 8 %), because of increased dry gas loss and higher moisture in the flue gas {{as a result of}} the GR process. Furnace slagging and convective section fouling can be adequately controlled. Because of the higher hydrogen/carbon (H/C) ratio of natural gas compared with coal, use of the GR process results in a modest reduction in CO{sub 2 } emissions. SO{sub 2 } and particulate emissions are reduced in direct proportion to the fraction of heat supplied by natural gas...|$|R

These Operator Advisory Systems utilize the Ultramax Method ™ and Dynamic Optimization, known as ULTRAMAXÆ. Of particular interest are the installations on Baldwin Units 1 and 2, which are 575 MW B&W cyclone units. Throughout the power generation industry, there has been great concern {{about how to deal with}} high NOx levels and meet EPA regulations while avoiding excessive capital costs. Based on previous applications of ULTRAMAX to cyclone units, a successful control strategy was employed for optimization of the Baldwin cyclones.

40|$|A four week {{testing program}} was {{completed}} during this project {{to assess the}} ability of the combination of deep staging, Rich Reagent Injection (RRI), and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to reduce NOx emissions below 0. 15 lb/MBtu in a <b>cyclone</b> fired <b>boiler.</b> The host site for the tests was AmerenUE's Sioux Unit 1, a 500 MW <b>cyclone</b> fired <b>boiler</b> located near St. Louis, MO. Reaction Engineering International (REI) led the project team including AmerenUE, FuelTech Inc., and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). This layered approach to NOx reduction is termed the Advanced Layered Technology Approach (ALTA). Installed RRI and SNCR port locations were guided by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based modeling conducted by REI. During the parametric testing, NOx emissions of 0. 12 lb/MBtu were achieved consistently from overfire air (OFA) -only baseline NOx emissions of 0. 25 lb/MBtu or less, when firing the typical 80 / 20 fuel blend of Powder River Basin (PRB) and Illinois No. 6 coals. From OFA-only baseline levels of 0. 20 lb/MBtu, NOx emissions of 0. 12 lb/MBtu were also achieved, but at significantly reduced urea flow rates. Under the deeply staged conditions that were tested, RRI performance was observed to degrade as higher blends of Illinois No. 6 were used. NOx emissions achieved with ALTA while firing a 60 / 40 blend were approximately 0. 15 lb/MBtu. NOx emissions while firing 100 % Illinois No. 6 were approximately 0. 165 lb/MBtu. Based on the performance results of these tests, economics analyses of the application of ALTA to a nominal 500 MW cyclone unit show that the levelized cost to achieve 0. 15 lb/MBtu is well below 75 % of the cost of a state of the art SCR...|$|R
40|$|Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) {{technology}} {{has been applied to}} a wide variety of applications since the late 1970 s. Flue gas generated from refinery off gas combustion to natural gas-, oil-, and coal-fired units has been treated with SCR. More recent applications include reduction of NOx emissions generated from orimulsion-fired boilers, diesel engines, process gas streams, i. e., nitric acid plants, calcining ovens, and gas turbines firing landfill and/or digester gas. At the heart of the SCR system is the catalyst. Each application mentioned above has unique design parameters. Therefore, a thorough understanding of catalyst behavior as it relates to the operating parameters is necessary, i. e., deactivation mechanisms, effect of sulfur content, load swings, ash loading, efficiency requirements, effect of maldistribution, etc. This paper helps the reader understand the importance of properly defining and evaluation design parameters to achieve the most cost-effective design and to assure reliable operation.

40|$|Under DOE sponsorship, McDermott Technology, Inc. (MTI), Babcock and Wilcox Company (B and W), and Minergy Corporation {{developed}} and evaluated a sludge derived fuel (SDF) made from sewage sludge. Our {{approach is to}} dry and agglomerate the sludge, combine it with a fluxing agent, if necessary, and co-fire the resulting fuel with coal in a <b>cyclone</b> <b>boiler</b> to recover the energy and to vitrify mineral matter into a non-leachable product. This product can then {{be used in the}} construction industry. A literature search showed that there is significant variability of the sludge fuel properties from a given wastewater plant (seasonal and/or day-to-day changes) or from different wastewater plants. A large sewage sludge sample (30 tons) from a municipal wastewater treatment facility was collected, dried, pelletized and successfully co-fired with coal in a cyclone-equipped pilot. Several sludge particle size distributions were tested. Finer sludge particle size distributions, similar to the standard B and W size distribution for sub-bituminous coal, showed the best combustion and slagging performance. Up to 74. 6 % and 78. 9 % sludge was successfully co-fired with pulverized coal and with natural gas, respectively. An economic evaluation on a 25 -MW power plant showed the viability of co-firing the optimum SDF in a power generation application. The return on equity was 22 to 31 %, adequate to attract investors and allow a full-scale project to proceed. Additional market research and engineering will be required to verify the economic assumptions. Areas to focus on are: plant detail design and detail capital cost estimates, market research into possible project locations, sludge availability at the proposed project locations, market research into electric energy sales and renewable energy sales opportunities at the proposed project location. As a result of this program, wastes that are currently not being used and considered an environmental problem will be processed into a renewable fuel.

40|$|A NO{sub x} {{minimization}} {{strategy for}} coal-burning wall-fired and <b>cyclone</b> <b>boilers</b> was developed that included deep air staging, innovative oxygen use, reburning, and advanced combustion control enhancements. Computational fluid dynamics modeling {{was applied to}} refine and select the best arrangements. Pilot-scale tests were conducted by firing an eastern high-volatile bituminous Pittsburgh No. 8 coal at 5 million Btu/hr in a facility that was set up with two-level overfire air (OFA) ports. In the wall-fired mode, pulverized coal was burned in a geometrically scaled down version of the B and W DRB- 4 Z{reg_sign} low-NO{sub x} burner. At a fixed overall excess air level of 17 %, NO{sub x} emissions with single-level OFA ports were around 0. 32 lb/million Btu at 0. 80 burner stoichiometry. Two-level OFA operation lowered the NO{sub x} levels to 0. 25 lb/million Btu. Oxygen enrichment in the staged burner reduced the NO{sub x} values to 0. 21 lb/million Btu. Oxygen enrichment plus reburning and 2 -level OFA operation further curbed the NO{sub x} emissions to 0. 19 lb/million Btu or by 41 % from conventional air-staged operation with single-level OFA ports. In the cyclone firing arrangement, oxygen enrichment of the cyclone combustor enabled high-temperature and deeply staged operation while maintaining good slag tapping. Firing the Pittsburgh No. 8 coal in the optimum arrangement generated 112 ppmv NO{sub x} (0. 15 lb/million Btu) and 59 ppmv CO. The optimum emissions results represent 88 % NO{sub x} reduction from the uncontrolled operation. Levelized costs for additional NO{sub x} removal by various in-furnace control methods in reference wall-fired or cyclone-fired units already equipped with single-level OFA ports were estimated and compared with figures for SCR systems achieving 0. 1 lb NO{sub x}/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu. Two-level OFA ports could offer the most economical approach for moderate NO{sub x} control, especially for smaller units. O{sub 2 } enrichment in combination with 2 -level OFA was not cost effective for wall-firing.

This study evaluated two plants: Wester Kentucky Energy Corporation's (WKE's) Reid Plant and TXU Energy's Monticello Plant for technical and economical feasibility. These plants were selected for their proximity to large supply of poultry litter in the area. The Reid plant is located in Henderson County in southwest Kentucky, with a large poultry processing facility nearby. Within a fifty-mile radius of the Reid plant, there are large-scale poultry farms that generate over 75, 000 tons/year of poultry litter. The local poultry farmers are actively seeking environmentally more benign alternatives to the current use of the litter as landfill or as a farm spread as fertilizer. The Monticello plant is located in Titus County, TX near the town of Pittsburgh, TX, where again a large poultry processor and poultry farmers in the area generate over 110, 000 tons/year of poultry litter.

Many coal- and oil-fired boilers at power stations have been retrofitted to permit multi-fuel flexibility. Biomass is a well-suited resource for co-firing with coal as an acid rain and greenhouse gas emission control strategy. Co-firing is a fuel-substitution option for existing capacity, {{and is not a}} capacity expansion option. Co-firing utilizing biomass (see Figure 1) has been successfully demonstrated in the full range of coal boiler types, including pulverized coal <b>boilers,</b> <b>cyclones,</b> stokers, and bubbling and circulating fluidized beds [1]. The system described here is specifically for pulverized coal-fired boilers which represent the majority of the current fleet of utility boilers in the U.

Work has focused on a promising class of processes in which ammonia is destroyed by strong oxidizing agents at ambient temperature during semi-dry processing (the use of moisture amounts less than 5 wt-%). Both ozone and an ozone/peroxide combination have been used to treat both basic and acidic ammonia-laden ashes...|$|R
40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy {{was used}} to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the gaseous products of combustion in an industrial-scale fluidized bed boiler. The analyses {{were used to determine}} characteristics of the coal fed into the boiler. The method was non-intrusive and performed under normal operating combustion conditions;An FTIR operates on the principle that an infrared beam passed through a gas will be absorbed by that gas in an amount proportional to the gas concentration and at wave lengths related to the gas species present;For short time frames (less than about 1 / 3 of the char time constant), both devolatilization and char burnout can be expressed as exponential decays of the CO 2 emissions resulting from introducing a batch of coal into the boiler;The FTIR system sampled combustion products from an Ahlstrom Pyropower circulating fluidized bed boiler at the Iowa State University power plant. The gas sample was drawn through the FTIR gas cell from the <b>boiler</b> <b>cyclone</b> outlet by a vacuum pump. To determine the coal properties, batches of coal were introduced into the boiler through a specially designed hopper installed {{on the end of the}} coal drag conveyor. These simulated pulses yielded sharp spikes in CO 2 emissions with rapid exponential decay during the volatiles release and combustion followed by a slower exponential decay in CO 2 to background levels during char burnout;Calculation of time constants was performed in both time and frequency domains with similar results. Frequency domain analysis was based on the assumption of first order processes for the devolatilization and char phases, and was found to provide results consistent with time domain parameters. Plotting decibels of the square of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the data (10 *log 10 (FFT 2)) vs. frequency resulted in the time constants of interest being visible as reciprocal cornering frequencies;Combustion dynamics in the operating boiler were found to be far more complex than previous research had indicated, with chemical kinetics being the limiting mechanism for char combustion. The ability to characterize coal combustion characteristics in an on-line boiler was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the seventh}} Quarterly Technical Report for DOE Cooperative Agreement No: DE-FC 26 - 00 NT 40753. The {{goal of the}} project is to develop cost {{effective}} analysis tools and techniques for demonstrating and evaluating low NOx control strategies and their possible impact on boiler performance for firing US coals. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) is providing co-funding for this program. This program contains multiple tasks and good {{progress is being made}} on all fronts. A series of field tests for RRI at the Ameren Sioux Unit No. 1 have demonstrated that RRI can provide up to 30 % NOx reduction over the use of over fire air in large scale (480 MW) <b>cyclone</b> fired utility <b>boilers.</b> The field tests and modeling results are in good agreement. Final data analysis has been completed for tests performed at Eastlake Power Station of a real-time waterwall corrosion monitoring system. The tests demonstrated that corrosion could be measured accurately in real-time in normal boiler operations, and an assessment of waterwall wastage could be made without impacting boiler availability. Detailed measurements of soot volume fraction have been performed for a coal burner in a pilot scale test furnace. The measured values are in good agreement with the expected trends for soot generation and destruction. Catalysts from four commercial manufacturers have been ordered and one of the samples was received this quarter. Several in situ analyses of vanadium-based SCR catalyst systems were completed at BYU. Results to date indicate that the system produces results that represent improvements compared to literature examples of similar experiments. Construction of the catalyst characterization system (CCS) reactor is nearly complete, with a few remaining details discussed in this report. A literature review originally commissioned from other parties is being updated and will be made available under separate cover as part of this investigation. Fabrication of the multi-catalyst slipstream reactor was completed during this quarter and shakedown testing was begun at the University of Utah pilot-scale coal furnace. Talks continued with two utilities that have expressed interest in hosting a demonstration...|$|R
