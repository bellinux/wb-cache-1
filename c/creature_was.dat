5|$|Blood {{was viewed}} as a potent source of {{nourishment}} for the Maya deities, and the sacrifice of a living <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> a powerful blood offering. By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice. Generally only high status prisoners of war were sacrificed, with lower status captives being used for labour.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, William Parker Foulke {{discovered}} {{the first known}} American dinosaur, in marl pits {{in the small town}} of Haddonfield, New Jersey. (Although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned.) The <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> named Hadrosaurus foulkii. It was an extremely important find: Hadrosaurus was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found (the first was in 1834, in Maidstone, England), and it was clearly a bipedal creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the United States.|$|E
5|$|That night workers put the flukeman into a U.S. Marshal's van unrestrained, but {{it kills}} {{the driver and}} escapes to a local campsite. The flukeman hides in a {{portable}} toilet and is suctioned into a truck's tank {{the next day when}} the toilet is drained. Mulder receives another phone call from the mysterious caller telling him that success on his current work is imperative so that the X-Files be reinstated undeniably. When he questions Scully about it, she denies any involvement. The flukeman is brought back to the processing plant. Scully believes that the flukeworm she found in the body is a larva, attempting to reproduce. One of the men at the processing plant is pulled underwater by the flukeman while investigating a storm drain overflow. Mulder heads in and saves him, apparently killing the flukeman by closing a sewer grate on it, slicing it in half. Scully concludes her investigation, thinking that the <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> brought to the U.S. by a Russian freighter that was hauling salvage material from Chernobyl, and that the <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> created in a 'soup' of radioactive sewage. Elsewhere, the flukeman's remains open its eyes.|$|E

Many Burmese <b>creatures</b> <b>are</b> part human or creatures capable of assuming human form. Most mythical <b>creatures</b> <b>are</b> endowed with humanistic mentalities, ability to converse with humans and also supernatural powers.During the 20th century, the role and diversity of Burmese mythical <b>creatures</b> <b>were</b> diversified by Shwe Thway comics which depicted {{the life of the}} Buddha, the Jataka tales and Burmese history.|$|R
50|$|Fierce <b>Creatures</b> <b>is</b> a 1997 farcical comedy film. While not {{literally}} a sequel, Fierce <b>Creatures</b> <b>is</b> a spiritual {{successor to the}} 1988 film A Fish Called Wanda. Both films star John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. Fierce <b>Creatures</b> <b>was</b> written by John Cleese, and directed by Robert Young and Fred Schepisi.|$|R
50|$|The enemy creatures {{appear in}} one of three colors: red, yellow or green. Red <b>creatures</b> <b>are</b> longer in length than the player, and as such a {{collision}} with the creature will cost the player one life. Yellow <b>creatures</b> <b>are</b> the same length as the player, thus posing no harm upon a collision. Green <b>creatures</b> <b>are</b> shorter than the player, and will be devoured by the player's creature if they collide. The player can shoot at the creatures, with each hit reducing the number of segments by one. As segments <b>are</b> removed, the <b>creatures</b> <b>are</b> able to move faster, thus making them harder to catch and eliminate.|$|R
5|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> {{created by}} means of a prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed behind the scenes. To fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the film to visual effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who digitally altered the footage until it was deemed suitable. The episode's title is a reference to Folie à deux, a form of insanity shared by two people. It usually begins with one person who conceives of a delusional belief and then spreads it to another; thus, those two share the same delusion.|$|E
5|$|To {{implement}} {{the transformation of}} the creature based on its alignment, Alex Evans developed an exporter program to export 3D Studio Max's models and animations, and Roberts created one to import them and apply them to the lion. Each version of the <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> then loaded, and interpolation code was written, as well as a blended animation between two similar ones. The system has a two-way blend: one for the alignment, and the other for how fat the creature is. As there {{was not going to be}} many creatures on one map, the team were able to use CPU resources to run many animations simultaneously on a single creature.|$|E
5|$|At the morgue, Scully {{explains}} that {{she studied the}} bite wounds and discovered that they are similar, but intrinsically different, than human bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva. Doggett finds the evidence interesting, due to the newspaper article he brought Scully: in 1956, a series of deaths was reported that ended {{when a group of}} hunters killed a man-bat creature and brought it to the county morgue in part of Montana. The coroner said the <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> neither bat nor man. Then the coroner was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel {{into the trunk of}} his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
5|$|Rusalka, {{named after}} the mythological <b>creature,</b> <b>was</b> ordered on 25 January 1865 and {{construction}} began on 10 June at the Admiralty Shipyard, Saint Petersburg, although the formal keel-laying was not until 6 June 1866. She was launched on 12 September 1867 and completed in 1869 {{at the cost of}} 762,000 rubles. Construction was considerably delayed by late deliveries of drawings, material, and the death of her original builder. The ship struck an uncharted rock off the Finnish coast in June 1869 and damaged her bottom plating badly enough that she had to be run aground to prevent her from sinking. Rusalka served her entire career with the Baltic Fleet and was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment in March 1870. The ship had her boilers replaced in 1878 and 1891 and she was reclassified as a coast-defense ironclad on 13 February 1892.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee's {{breath was}} thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and it was {{considered}} responsible for epidemics and drought. Seaweed burning to create what was known {{at the time as}} kelp began on Stronsay in 1722. The product– soda ash– was an alkali mainly used to treat acidic soil, although as time went on its commercial importance in soap and glass manufacture increased. The pungent smoke emitted during the process was believed to enrage the nuckelavee, resulting in a wild rampage of plague, the deaths of cattle and the destruction of crops. The nuckelavee was said to have infected horses on Stronsay with the deadly disease known as mortasheen, to demonstrate its fury and exact its revenge against the islanders for burning seaweed; the infection subsequently spread to all the other islands involved in the industry. The <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> also blamed for prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortages and poor harvests.|$|E

5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded the {{creature}} in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the <b>creature,</b> <b>was</b> trying to euthanize the creature, not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to {{the woman in the}} woods who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks the way it does because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the jockey <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> not {{explored}} in the film, but Scott later theorized {{that it might have}} been the ship's pilot, and that the ship might have been a weapons-carrier capable of dropping alien eggs onto a planet so that the aliens could use the local lifeforms as hosts. In early versions of the script, the eggs were to be located in a separate pyramid structure which would be found later by the Nostromo crew and would contain statues and hieroglyphs depicting the alien reproductive cycle, contrasting the human, alien, and space jockey cultures. Cobb, Foss, and Giger each created concept artwork for these sequences, but they were eventually discarded due to budgetary concerns and the need to make the film shorter. Instead, the egg chamber was set inside the derelict ship and was filmed on the same set as the space-jockey scene; the entire disc piece supporting the jockey and its chair were removed and the set was re-dressed to create the egg chamber. Light effects in the egg chamber were created by lasers borrowed from English rock band The Who. The band was testing the lasers for use in their stage show on the sound-stage next door.|$|E
5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey in {{transforming}} Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating <b>creature</b> <b>was</b> a key {{contribution to the}} effectiveness of the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed {{from time to time in}} the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E

5|$|Varno said he {{received}} uncredited assistance from {{his friends and}} fellow screenwriters Jerome Bixby and Harold Jacob Smith, the latter of whom won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for the film The Defiant Ones (1958). Varno ran lines and ideas by both men and sought advice. Smith in particular inspired lines for the speech made by the monster {{at the end of}} the film, in which the creature discusses how the human characters consider him the embodiment of evil simply because he is different from them. Varno said much of that dialogue from Smith, however, ended up getting cut from the final film. One of the primary themes of the film, as embodied in John Corcoran's attempts to defend the alien <b>creature,</b> <b>was</b> that simply because someone or something is ugly or different does not necessarily make it evil. However, the script also followed a common trait of most horror films of the 1950s that even somewhat understandable monsters are not entirely sympathetic, and the Blood Beast creature proves itself evil by impregnating Corcoran against his will and pursuing world domination.|$|E
