The PI additional controller is finally designed to control the decoupled 1 -order pseudolinear system to make it possible to adjust the performance of the subsystem.

40|$|Interaction between robot and {{environment}} {{is an extremely}} important aspect of robotic research. Compliance helps reduce the impact effects of robot/environment interaction. Hybrid position/force control is important in most robotic tasks; accurate position control is needed in unconstrained directions, and accurate force control is needed in constrained directions. Force control can be more responsive with a compliant force/ torque sensor, but positional accuracy is reduced with compliance. An instrumented compliant wrist device {{can be used to}} achieve both responsive force control and accurate position control. The wrist is <b>connect</b> <b>in</b> <b>series</b> between the end of the robot and the tool, and is designed to partially surround the tool, thus reducing the distance between the end of the robot {{and the end of the}} tool. The wrist device uses rubber elements for compliance and damping, and a serial linkage, with potentiometers at each joint, is used for sensing the deflections produced in the wrist. This document describes the newest version of the instrumented compliant wrist, including modifications and improvements to the wrist described in "Design of a Tool Surrounding compliant Instrumented Wrist", available as tech report MS-CIS- 91 - 30, GRASP LAB 258 from the University of Pennsylvania.

40|$|Non-metallic, flexible, thin, {{microchannel}} {{heat exchangers}} made from heat-sealable polyimide films {{have recently been}} developed for refrigeration and air-conditioning applications. In order for these heat exchangers to function properly and independently, robust and reliable connectors are needed. The connectors must be easy to manufacture and assemble, hold high pressures without leaking, resist a pullout force, and {{have the ability to}} connect to standard tubing and piping and different heat exchangers together in series and parallel. Three uniquely different functional prototype connector designs have been developed, manufactured, and tested. The first includes a machined metal connector internally embedded within the heat exchanger that is capable of holding pressures up to 0. 83 MPa and 65. 5 N of pullout force before failure. The second connector design includes a two-piece polymer assembly containing an o-ring used to seal around the inlet and outlet holes of the heat exchanger. The design incorporates a 10 -degree wedge that creates the sealing force when fully assembled with the heat exchanger and has been pressure tested to 1. 83 MPa without leaking and 73. 6 N of pullout force applied before failure. A variation of the design allows multiple heat exchangers to <b>connect</b> <b>in</b> <b>series</b> and in parallel. Finally, the third design contains no additional parts and connects two heat exchangers together by thermally bonding the inlet of one heat exchanger to the outlet of another. The thermally bonded connection was able to hold pressures greater than 2. 07 MPa. Finally, fatigue testing of the heat exchangers is conducted using an Instron machine to develop a stress amplitude versus number of cycles to failure diagram for the zero pressure case.

40|$|There {{are many}} applications, such as paper mills, {{locomotive}} traction and machine tools, which require high performance control {{of more than}} one electric motor. These multi-motor drives are generally available in two configurations. The first one consists of a number of three-phase voltage source inverters (VSI) connected in parallel to a common DC link, each inverter feeding a three-phase AC motor. This configuration allows independent control of all machines by means of their own three-phase VSIs. The second method comprises one inverter, which feeds multiple parallel-connected three-phase motors. However, this configuration does not allow independent control of each motor and is suitable only for traction. This thesis explores a novel concept for multi-motor drive systems, based on utilization of multi-phase machines and VSIs, and series connection of all the machines in the group. Application of a single multi-phase VSI in conjunction with multi-phase machines generates additional degrees of freedom. The research presented here utilises these additional degrees of freedom to control a number of machines independently within a novel multi-phase multi-machine drive. The concept is {{based on the fact that}} independent flux and torque control of any AC machine, regardless of the number of stator phases requires control of only two stator current components. This leaves the remaining current components free to control other machines within the group. It is shown that it is possible to connect the machines in such a way that what one machine sees as the flux/torque producing components the other machines see as non-flux/torque producing components, and vice versa. Therefore it is possible to <b>connect</b> <b>in</b> <b>series</b> a number of multi-phase machines and independently control each machine while supplying them from a single multi-phase inverter. Different configurations of the multi-motor drive are possible depending on certain properties of the supply phase number. In general, higher the supply phase number is, higher the number of connectable machines is. However, some phase numbers are more favourable than others, as discussed in detail in the thesis. Simulation studies are provided for five, six, seven, nine, ten and fifteen phase configurations in order to verify the concept. It is shown that the concept is independent of the type of AC machines used and the only requirement is that they all have sinusoidal distributed magnetomotive force. Current control in both the stationary and rotating reference frames is considered and it is concluded that current control in the rotating reference frame requires compensation of the additional voltage drops caused by the series connection. Two possible methods of compensating for these voltage drops are suggested and verified by simulation. Finally, a laboratory rig is described, which utilises two three-phase inverters connected in such a way as to form a single six-phase inverter. A six-phase two-motor drive comprising a symmetrical six-phase induction machine and a three-phase induction machine or a three-phaseP MSM is investigatede xperimentally. An analysis of the performance of the two-motor drive is presented and it is shown that decoupled control of each machine is achieved...|$|E
