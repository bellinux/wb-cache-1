Building on asymmetric information theory, factors identified in previous research are grouped into the theoretical categories of risk-assessment, risk-alignment, and risk-shifting. Hypotheses are developed as to what influences lending officers' <b>credit</b> <b>assessments.</b> In addition, it is hypothesized that risk-taking proclivity interacts with other variables. A conjoint experiment involving 114 lending officers is used to test the hypotheses, which are, by and large, supported by the data. Furthermore, the study investigates how individual differences in experience among lending officers affect the <b>credit</b> <b>assessments,</b> e. g., more experienced lending officers use more sophisticated decision policies involving interactions. When the results from the experiments were compared with the lending officers' self-perceived assessments, it was discovered that lending officers have limited insight into their own <b>credit</b> <b>assessments.</b> The findings of this study have implications for SMEs, lending officers, and lending organizations. The results can assist SMEs to better tailor loan applications. Banks can use the results to make comparisons with their existing credit guidelines, which could assist them in improving their decision-making. The three theoretical categories identified provide a foundation for future research on bank lending to SMEs. The developed model can facilitate empirical research on bank lending under asymmetric information by providing a structure and categorizing previous research into relevant categories...|$|R

40|$|UNIVERSITY OF PLYMOUTH UK School of Business Department of Accounting, Finance and Economics ABSTRACT Doctor of Philosophy Accounting disclosure, {{financial}} transparency, {{ownership structure}} and corporate governance: implications for {{internal and external}} WVB Jordanian <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments</b> By Abdullah A. K. Al-Khawaaldah Bani Hasan (Ash-Shu’ayree As-Salafi) Creditworthiness is a quality {{that is important to}} all stakeholders of an organisation, especially bondholders. It is posited that good corporate governance practices assist the confidence that stakeholders have in an organization’s ability to generate the strong cash flows that are needed to meet financial obligations, which in turn should enhance <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments.</b> Much research has been conducted into rating assessments, but these have largely been directed at developed markets and they have not generally been focused on the impact of good corporate governance practices and procedures. The primary focus of this research is to address this issue through an investigation into the impact of key factors upon the <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments</b> of listed companies on the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) in Jordan, as assessed by World'vest Base Inc. (WVB) <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessment</b> scores for Jordanian companies between 2005 and 2007 inclusively. Drawing upon insights from agency (including management disciplining and wealth redistribution hypotheses), stewardship, stakeholder, signalling, legitimacy and the diffusion of innovation theories, this thesis investigates the determinants of WVB <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments</b> of Jordanian firms under five headings: accounting and financial aspects, market and regulatory perspectives, influence of ownership structure, financial transparency/disclosure and corporate governance factors. To achieve this, an array of modelling techniques is used in order to provide a more comprehensive picture. They include bivariate analysis, one-way analysis of variance, ordinary least square regressions for numerical scores, binary logistic regressions, and ordinal logistic regression. The results demonstrate that accounting and financial factors {{have a significant impact on}} <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments</b> but not capital intensity. Profitability is positively associated with <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments,</b> while leverage and loss propensity have a negative association. With respect to market and regulatory factors, size and Tobin’s Q are positively associated with <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments.</b> By contrast type of sector and audit are not related to <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments.</b> Foreign ownership enhances ratings, whilst institutional ownership has a negative impact. Also, insider ownership and family ownership have some importance. It was surprising to find that whilst financial transparency and disclosure variables are significantly associated positively with <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments</b> in some models, they were generally not significant across other models. Nevertheless, the study finds empirical evidence to support a degree of association between <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments</b> and corporate governance factors. There is also a positive association between board size and <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments,</b> but the most important aspect of corporate governance for Jordanian firms is board expertise. The originality of this thesis also embraces the inclusion not only of externally published WVB risk assessments in the Jordanian context, but also internal numerical ratings that were made available with kind permission from the WVB agency for the purposes of this research. The question is whether there are insights that can be gained from such internal ratings that have not hitherto been made available to other researchers. The answer is in the affirmative, for role duality on the board of directors is evidently more important to WVB’s own internal numerical rating assessments than is evidenced by the WVB externally published <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessments.</b> Specifically, the significance of corporate governance (role duality) is missed by multivariate models that are based solely on externally published data. Furthermore, financial transparency and disclosure variables reveal more (albeit moderate) support for the more refined internal scores of WVB than for the external assessment ratings. Finally, family ownership is also important to WVB’s internal scores. Thus, this research has enabled deeper insights to be gained into <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessment</b> determinants within the Jordanian context. THE HASHEMIET UNIVERSITY- JORDA...|$|R

Therefore, these companies are not required to go through stringent regulatory compliance to get finance. However, commercial banks are required to assess risk in standard format against all loans before the same is sanctioned. Considering the increase in risk in all economic sectors due to various reasons, the central bank asked all commercial banks to assess the client risk and tie the same with its capital adequacy requirement.

50|$|These complex {{statistical}} analyses {{were supposed to}} function as a good substitute for risk monitoring provided by individual branch bank managers. Had the model been correct, these inadequately assessed loans would have been rated as high risk resulting in a lower price for the bond. However, when housing prices were constantly increasing, borrowers with inadequate income could cover mortgage repayments by borrowing further money against increased value of their house. This somewhat fictitious good payment record, which may be obvious if it was monitored by a bank manager, fed into the mathematical model of rating agencies whose weakness was exposed when the housing market start to tank. The credibility of <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> provided by rating agencies was further eroded when it was revealed that they took a cut in the sales of securitised bonds which they themselves rated. When the entire spectrum of bundled loans from sub prime to premium AAA start to under-perform against statistical expectations, the valuation of assets held by SIVs became suspect. SIVs suddenly found it difficult to sell commercial paper while their previously sold commercial paper neared maturity. Moreover, their supposedly prime rated assets could be sold only at a heavy discount. In effect, this preciptaed a run on the entire non-bank system and since the banks relied on the SIVs and other non-banks for funding this also created a huge pressure on the banking system.|$|E
40|$|<b>Credit</b> <b>assessment</b> is {{the basis}} and premise of credit risk {{management}} systems. Accurate and scientific <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> is of great significance to the operational decisions of shareholders, corporate creditors, and management. Building a good and reliable <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> model is key to <b>credit</b> <b>assessment.</b> Traditional <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> models are constructed using the support vector machine (SVM) combined with certain traditional dimensionality reduction algorithms.

Then, machine learning of the samples will be conducted using the SVM, in order to carry out classification assessment. To further improve the accuracy of <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> methods, this paper has introduced more cutting-edge algorithms, applied isometric feature mapping (Isomap) for dimensionality reduction, and used the relevance vector machine (RVM) for credit classification. It has constructed an Isomap-RVM model and used it to conduct financial analysis of China's listed companies. The empirical analysis shows that the <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> accuracy of the Isomap-RVM model is significantly higher than that of the Isomap-SVM model and slightly higher than that of the PCA-RVM model.

30|$|According to Dinh and Kleimeier (2007), the {{determination}} of loans {{does not depend on}} the borrower’s income or the amount of collateral, but rather on the qualitative analysis (of, for example, the borrower’s personality, reputation, or social status). Because the maintenance of social credit relationships is expensive, banks typically adopt the credit scoring model to quantitatively analyze a borrower’s credit situation to determine loans and identify whether a borrower can obey the contract. Banks’ <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> of corporate customers is a multiple-criteria decision-making problem in which various elements are comprehensively assessed. The construction of an effective <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> model requires that credit staff possess sufficient professional knowledge and practical experience. Previous <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> studies have mostly analyzed the opinion of a group of credit staff by using a single precise value, which cannot fully describe the actual distribution of credit staff opinions and tends to diminish minority and peculiar opinions. Therefore, precise values are inapplicable in actual decision environments and constructed <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> models do not possess the features of anti-catastrophism and sensitivity, which are the criteria of a superior assessment system (Hsieh 2003). Srinivasan and Kim (1988) stated that <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> can be conducted using theory-based scientific and objective methods. The experience of credit decision managers and senior credit staff responsible for <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> can be applied to <b>credit</b> <b>assessment</b> models for determining credit categorization and rating weights (Chiou and Shen 2011; Lee et al. 2016).|$|E

The results show that, when the ratio of the dataset for training and testing is 800 : 1200, the neural network model 2 for <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessment</b> has better performance. And it can achieve the desired accuracy and computational efficiency, so the BP network system for <b>credit</b> risk <b>assessment</b> is optimized...|$|R
