40|$|We {{conducted}} a laboratory experiment (n= 602) {{to test the}} effect on behaviour of six different <b>cookie</b> <b>banner</b> messages. These messages were based on four behavioural insights: defaults, information deficit model, protection motivation theory (PMT) and social norms. A control condition presented the traditional <b>cookie</b> <b>banner</b> message as recommended by the European Commission (EC). The behavioural measures were (a) the decision to accept cookies, (b) the decision to click on a link {{for more information about}} a website's cookie policy and (c) the time spent reading cookie policy pages.

5|$|Norton Internet Security 2000, {{released}} January 10, 2000, was Symantec's {{first foray}} beyond virus protection and content control filters.

Version 2000s firewall, based on AtGuard from WRQ, filters traffic at the packet level. It can block ActiveX controls and Java applets. Other functionalities include <b>cookie</b> removal, and <b>banner</b> ad blocking. ZDNet found the ad blocker removed graphics {{that were not}} ads, breaking pages. Adjusting the settings fixed the problem, however the process was complicated. ZDNet noted {{the lack of information}} presented concerning attacks the firewall blocked.
