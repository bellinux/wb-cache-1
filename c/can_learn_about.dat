5|$|Diamond {{writes that}} jury {{consultants}} then compare the three data sets {{to determine which}} background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.|$|E

The day-night cycle influences some monsters (and their powers), as a werewolf becomes powerful {{during the night}} of a full moon. Players <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> their enemies and prepare for combat by reading the in-game bestiary. When they kill an enemy, they can loot its corpse for valuables. Geralt's witcher sense enables players to find objects of interest, including items that can be collected or scavenged. Items are stored in the inventory, which can be expanded by purchasing upgrades. Players can sell items to vendors (who pay in crowns) or use them to craft potions and bombs. They can visit blacksmiths to craft new weapons and armour with what they have gathered. The price of an item {{and the cost of}} crafting it vary, depending on a region's local economy.|$|E
25|$|Semantic {{memory is}} one of the two types of {{declarative}} or explicit memory (our memory of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved). Semantic memory refers to general world knowledge that we have accumulated throughout our lives. This general knowledge (facts, ideas, meaning and concepts) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture. Semantic memory is distinct from episodic memory, which is our memory of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point. For instance, semantic memory might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of petting a particular cat. We <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> new concepts by applying our knowledge learned from things in the past. The counterpart to declarative or explicit memory is nondeclarative memory or implicit memory.|$|E

500|$|A {{range of}} {{animal and plant}} {{specimens}} that became entrapped and were then preserved in tar pits have been removed and studied so that researchers <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> the past. The Rancho LaBrea tar pits located near Los Angeles in southern California are a collection of pits of sticky asphalt deposits that differ in deposition time from 40,000 to 12,000YBP. Commencing 40,000YBP, trapped asphalt has been moved through fissures to the surface by methane pressure, forming seeps that can cover several square meters and be [...] deep. The dire wolf has been made famous {{because of the large}} number of its fossils recovered there. Over 200,000 specimens (mostly fragments) have been recovered from the tar pits, with the remains ranging from Smilodon to squirrels, invertebrates, and plants. [...] The time period represented in the pits includes the Last Glacial Maximum when global temperatures were [...] lower than today, the Pleistocene–Holocene transition (Bølling-Allerød interval), the Oldest Dryas cooling, the Younger Dryas cooling from 12,800 to 11,500YBP, and the American megafaunal extinction event 12,700YBP when 90 genera of mammals weighing over [...] became extinct.|$|E
