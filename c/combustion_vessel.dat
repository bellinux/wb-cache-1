This level of understanding is needed to develop the high-fidelity multi-scale CFD models that will be used to optimize future engine designs. Several spray chamber facilities capable of high-temperature, high-pressure conditions typical of engine combustion have been developed, but because of the uniqueness of each facility, there are uncertainties about their operation. The Engine Combustion Network (ECN) is a worldwide group of institutions using <b>combustion</b> <b>vessels,</b> whose aim is to advance the state of spray and combustion knowledge at engine-relevant conditions. A key activity is the use of spray chamber facilities operated at specific target conditions in order to leverage research capabilities and advanced diagnostics of all ECN participants.

For this paper, we describe results from the constant-volume pre-burn vessel at Eindhoven University of Technology. The executed measurements include a wide range of diagnostics to characterize “spray A” in reacting and non-reacting conditions in great detail. Observations of spray penetration, ignition, liquid length and flame lift-off location by using several high-speed imaging diagnostics are discussed and compared with other ECN participating institutes.

The process was studied previously in an experiment employing Diesel # 2 as the fuel in the same <b>combustion</b> <b>vessel.</b> In the experiment a lifted flame was first established at a position downstream of the nozzle. An ignition kernel was then initiated using a high-energy pulse laser at a position upstream of the natural lift-off position of the diesel flame. The laser-ignition kernel was modelled using a high-temperature (∼ 2000 K) hot spot. In both experiment and simulations the upstream front of the ignition kernel was shown to remain around the initial laser ignition site for a substantially long period of time, while the downstream front of the ignition kernel propagates rapidly towards the natural lift-off position downstream of the laser ignition site. The lift-off position oscillated before the final stabilization at the natural lift-off position. The structures and the propagation speed of the reaction fronts in the laser-ignition kernel and the main flame were analysed. Two different stabilization mechanisms, the auto-ignition mechanism and the flame propagation mechanism, were identified for the naturally lifted flame and the laser-induced reaction front, respectively.

A novel multiple burnt gas zone model has been developed to describe the different aspects of premixed laminar combustion in a closed spherical vessel. The mixture is divided into burnt and unburnt gases with the flame front as a discontinuity. Unburnt gases {{are assumed to be}} in a frozen chemical state. However, burnt gases are divided into a number of burnt gas zones. For the methane–air mixture the model is used to determine the temperature distribution within the burnt gas, the relationship between the pressure rise and mass fraction burnt, the variation of the combustion products with temperature and pressure, the spatial distribution of the gas density, the influence of elevated initial temperature, pressure and molecular structure. This computation allows for the variation in heat capacity of the constituents, and solves the equilibrium combustion equation for the ten major species (N 2, O 2, H 2, CO, CO 2, H 2 O, O, H, NO, OH).

To {{reduce the risk}} associated with dust, we need to assess the risk of explosion. This assessment can {{be based on the}} determination of the explosion characteristics of the dust. A fuel such as coal is allowed to combust in oxy-fuel atmospheres (mixtures of oxygen and carbon dioxide) and the explosion risk increases especially in oxygen enriched atmospheres with an O 2 -concentration greater than 21 %. To determine the explosion characteristics of the bituminous South African coal, experiments are performed with different mixture concentrations of coal, CO 2 and O 2. Measuring the minimum ignition energy (MIE) which is an important ignition sensitivity parameter shows that the MIE decreases significantly when the oxygen concentration in the mixture is increased. The violence of the explosion, which is a parameter for the explosion severity, is expressed by the maximum rate of pressure rise (dP/dt) max or Kst-value. This Kst is measured with a standard test apparatus with a content of 20 L using pyrotechnical igniters. This paper also explores the maximum burning velocity which is derived from the pressure histories. In order to achieve the burning velocities, experimental data are analyzed based upon the theoretical model of Dahoe and Van den Bulck. These models were induced by using a two-zone model for the adiabatic <b>combustion</b> in closed <b>vessels.</b> The results revealed that there is considerable dependence among the severity characteristic and the burning velocity and the oxygen concentration.

40|$|Ethanol is {{attractive}} as a renewable fuel for spark ignition engines, {{and can also}} be used as an extender in gasoline (up to about 20 % by volume) or as a major component (say above 70 % by volume). There are three reasons for wanting to know the laminar burning velocity of water/ethanol/air mixtures. The first reason is that a significant fraction of the fuel calorific value is required to remove the last 10 per cent or so by volume of water from bio-ethanol, and in some applications it might not be necessary to remove all the water. The second reason is to provide extended data for model validation. The third reason is that in turbocharged engines the knock-free operating range can be extended through water addition so as to improve both output and efficiency. Laminar burning velocity measurements with up to 40 % water by volume have been made with a constant volume <b>combustion</b> <b>vessel</b> using two distinct techniques: a) imaging of the flame front during the constant pressure period and b) analyzing the pressure rise data. When the pressure rises the adiabatic core is compressed isentropically, so if a combustion model is used, a single experiment generates a sequence of measurements that include data at high temperatures (up to 600  K) and high pressures (up to 12 bar) that are relevant to spark ignition engine combustion. Data from the two methods is shown here to be consistent and in-line with published data for ethanol, and satisfactory comparisons have also been found with predictions from kinetic mechanisms for the ethanol/water/air mixtures. The constant volume <b>combustion</b> <b>vessel</b> also generates data on the Markstein length and the pressure at the onset of cellularity, with both being increased by the presence of water. The laminar burning velocity has a direct influence on the early flame growth in a spark ignition engine, and unless the ignition timing is adjusted for slow burning mixtures there will be a significant loss of efficiency.

40|$|Vent {{devices for}} {{gas and dust}} explosions are often ducted to safety {{locations}} by means of relief pipes for the discharge of hot combustion products or blast waves (NFPA 68, 2002). The presence of the duct {{is likely to increase}} the severity of the explosion with respect to simply vented vessels posing a problem for the proper design of this venting configuration. The phenomenology of the vented explosion is complicated as the interaction of combustion in the duct with primary combustion in the protected vessel intrudes the problem. Several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the enhanced violence of the explosion in such a venting configuration but uncertainty still stands. The lack of both investigation and comprehension has so far prevented the development of reliable engineering guidelines for the sizing of the vent area. Prior to any development of engineering correlations, a preparatory step should be the investigation {{of the nature of the}} interaction of the external combustion with the venting process. In this work pilot scale experimental data are presented for an uncovered duct vented configuration. Moreover, a CFD 2 D axy-symmetric model based on the unsteady RANS approach is developed. The numerical model has been validated by comparison with available experimental results on a lab scale configuration and then tested on the pilot scale configuration. Numerical and experimental results have evidenced that the severity of ducted explosion is mainly driven by the vigorous secondary explosion occurring in the duct (burn-up). In particular the combustion in the duct has been found to interact with the internal combustion by means of purely mechanical effects. In dependence of the violence of the explosion in the duct, the mechanical effect acts as pre compression of the mixture in the vessel or venting flow rate reduction. No enhancement effects of the <b>combustion</b> in the <b>vessel</b> have been found to significantly affect the violence of the explosion. Experimental data analysis - aided by the numerical results- have highlighted that as the scale of the explosion goes up, the external explosion moves toward more severe conditions.

The variations of SO 2 over Hong Kong were discussed {{from the standpoint of}} monthly variations, inter-annual variabilities and spatial distributions and wind effects. The PCA result is able to identify two dominant modes of SO 2 variations. The first mode is associated with weak southerlies and southwesterlies, and is localized around the Kowloon peninsula. This may be a consequence of the surrounding complex terrain. Analysis of speciated PM 10 data shows that this mode is associated with local SO 2 emissions by residual oil combustion from marine sources at or near the container terminal in Kwan Chung (KC). The second mode is associated with moderate to strong northwesterlies, and is affected most of the area in Hong Kong. Analysis of speciated PM 10 data suggests that this mode is associated with a mixture of various sources, and mainly related to the regional transport from the northwest. In addition, the proportion of the total SO 2 concentrations contributed by each of the source regions was quantitatively estimated by SVD. It is found that residual oil <b>combustion</b> from marine <b>vessels</b> at or near Kwai Chung terminal container port and power plant are responsible for 36 % and 7 % of the total SO 2 concentrations in the urban air of Hong Kong, respectively. It means that the contribution of marine sources from container port is five times more than power plants. We also find that the seasonal variation of element carbon in PM 10 species is high in summer and low in winter from the container port, which helps us further understand its characteristics over Hong Kong...|$|R
40|$|Producer gas {{derived from}} biomass {{is one of}} the most {{environment}} friendly substitutes to the fossil fuels. Usage of producer gas for power generation has effect of zero net addition of CO 2 in atmosphere. The engines working on producer gas have potential to decrease the dependence on conventional fuels for power generation. However, the combustion process is governed by complex interactions between chemistry and fluid dynamics, some of which are not completely understood. Improved knowledge of combustion is, therefore, of vital importance for both direct use in the design of engines, and for the evolution of reliable simulation tools for engine development. The present work is related to the turbulent combustion of producer gas in closed vessels and engine cylinders. The main objective of the work was multi-dimensional simulation of turbulent combustion in the bowl-in-piston engine operating on producer gas fuel and to observe the flame and flow field interaction. First, the combustion model was validated in constant volume combustion chamber with experimental results. Experimental turbulent combustion data of producer gas (composition matching with engine operating conditions) was presented. The required data of laminar burning velocity of producer gas was computed and used in the simulation of turbulent <b>combustion</b> in closed <b>vessel.</b> The effect of squish and reverse squish flow on flame propagation in the bowl-in-piston engine cylinder was described. Laminar burning velocity of unstretched flame was computed using flame code which was developed earlier in this laboratory. One dimensional computations of unstretched planar flame were made to calculate laminar burning velocity of the producer gas-air mixture at pressures (1 - 10 bar) and temperatures (300 - 600 K). A correlation of laminar burning velocity of producer gas as a function of pressure and temperature was fitted and compared with experiments. A fixed composition and equivalence ratio of producer gas-air mixture, typical of the engine operating conditions, was considered. The correlation was used in simulation of turbulent <b>combustion</b> in closed <b>vessel.</b> The turbulent <b>combustion</b> experiments with producer gas-air mixture were conducted in a closed vessel. The aim of experiments was to generate pressure-time data, in closed vessel during turbulent flame propagation, which was required to validate turbulent combustion models. Determination of (ST /SL) was made from pressure-time data which requires corresponding laminar combustion data with same initial conditions. For this purpose a set of laminar combustion experiments was conducted. Experimental setup consists of a constant volume combustion chamber of cubical shape and size 80 x 80 x 80 mm 3. The initial mixtures pressure and temperature were 1 bar and 300 K respectively. A fixed composition and equivalence ratio of producer gas-air mixture, typical of the engine operating conditions, was used. The composition of producer gas was H 2 - 19. 61 %, CO 2 - 19. 68 %, CH 4 - 2. 52 %, CO 2 - 12. 55 % and N 2 - 45. 64 % on volume basis. Fuel-air mixture was ignited with electric spark at the center of the cube. Initial turbulence in the chamber was created by moving a perforated plate with specified velocity. Perforated plate was placed in chamber so that the central hole in the plate passes over the spark electrodes as it sweeps across the chamber. Two geometrically similar plates with hole diameter of 5 and 10 mm were used. The new experimental setup constructed as a part of this work was first tested with one set of experiments each with methane and propane data of SL and ST /SL from the literature. Maximum turbulent intensity (u’) achieved was 1. 092 ms− 1. The ratios of turbulent to laminar burning velocity (ST /SL) values were determined at six different turbulence intensity levels. Laminar combustion experiments were extended to elevated initial pressures 2 - 5 bar and temperature 300 K. The value of SL was calculated from the pressure-time history recorded during laminar stretching flame propagation inside closed vessel. These SL values were compared with computed SL,∞ after accounting for stretch. Turbulent combustion simulations were carried out to validate combustion models suitable for multi-dimensional CFD simulation of combustion in constant volume closed chamber. Two models proposed by Choi and Huh, based on Flame Surface Density (FSD) were tested with the present experimental results. User FORTRAN code for the source terms in transport equation of FSD was implemented in ANSYS-CFX 10. 0 software. First model called CFM 1, grossly under-predicted the rate of combustion. The second model called CFM 2, predicted the results satisfactorily after replacing the arbitrary length scale with turbulent integral length scale (lt) having a limiting value near the wall. The modified CFM 2 model was able to predict the propagation phase of the developed flame satisfactorily, though the duration for initial flame development was over-predicted by the model. CFD simulation of producer gas engine combustion process was carried out using ANSYSCFX software. Mesh deformation option was used to take care of moving boundaries such as piston and valve surfaces. The fluid domain expands during suction process and contracts during compression process. In order to avoid excessive distortion of the mesh elements, a series of meshes at different crank angle positions were generated and checked for their quality during mesh motion in the solver. For suction process simulation, unstructured meshes having 0. 1 to 0. 3 million cells were used. During the compression and combustion process simulations, structured meshes having 40, 000 to 0. 1 million cells were used. k-ε model was used for turbulence simulation. The suction, compression and combustion processes of an SI engine were simulated. Initial flame kernel was given by providing high flame surface density in a small volume comparable to the spark size at the time of ignition. The flame surface density model, CFM- 2, was adapted with the modification of length scale tested against constant volume experiments. A suitable limiting value was used to avoid abnormal flame propagation near the wall. The limiting value of integral length scale (lt) near the wall was determined by linear extrapolation of the integral length scale in the domain to the wall. Engine p - θ curves of three different ignition timings 26 °, 12 ° and 6 °before top dead center (TDC) were simulated and compared with earlier experimental results. The effects of flow field on flame propagation have been observed. A comparison of the simulated and experimental p - θ diagram of the engine for all above cases gave mixed results. For the ignition timing at 26 ° before TDC case, predicted peak pressure value was 17 % higher and at 3 ° earlier than those of the experimental peak. For the other two cases, the predicted peak pressure value was 28 % lower and 5 ° later than those of the experimental peak. The reason for under-prediction of the pressure values could be due to the delay in development of initial flame kernel. Simulated pressure curves have offset about 3 - 4 ° compared to the experimental pressure curves. It was observed that in all predicted p - θ cases, there was a delay in the initial flame development. It is evident from the under-prediction of pressure values, especially in the initial flame kernel development phase and it also affects the p - θ curve at later stage. The delay was about 3 - 4 ° of crank angle rotation in various cases. The delay in predicting the initial flame development needs to be corrected in order to predict the combustion process properly. The proposed FSD model seems to have capability to predict p - θ values fairly in the propagation phase of developed flame. Reasonably good match was obtained by advancing the ignition timing in the computation by about 3 - 4 ° compared to the experimental setting. In the bowl-in-piston engine cylinders, the flow in the cylinder is characterised by squish and reverse squish when the piston is moving towards and away from the top dead center (TDC) respectively. The effect of squish and reverse squish flow on flame propagation has been assessed. For the more advanced ignition case, i. e., 26 ° before TDC, The flame propagation did not have favorable effect by the flow field. The direction of flame propagation was against the squish and reverse squish flow. This resulted in suppressed peak velocities in the cylinder compared the motoring process. Hence the burning rate was not augmented by the turbulence inside the cylinder. For the ignition 12 ° before TDC case, the flame propagation did have favorable effect by the flow field. During the reverse squish period, the flame had reached the bowl wall. At this stage, the flame was pushing the reactants out and this augments the reverse-squish flow, and hence the maximum reverse-squish velocity was increased to 2. 03 times the peak reverse-squish velocity of motoring case. The reverse-squish flow was distorting the flame from spherical shape and the flame gets stretched. Flame surface enters the cylindrical region faster compared to the previous case. The stretched flame in the reverse-squish flow may be considered as reverse squish flame, as was proposed earlier by Sridhar G. The burn rate during the reverse squish period may be 2 to 2. 5 times the normal burn rate. For the ignition 6 ° before TDC case, the flame was very small in size and it did not affect the flow in squish period. During the reverse squish period, the flame radius was moderate compared to the bowl radius. The flame was pushing the reactants out and it increased the maximum reverse-squish velocity to 1. 3 times by the flame. In this case, the reverse-squish flow moderately affecting the flame shapes. The results of this study could give an idea of what ignition timing must be kept for favorable use of flow field inside the engine cylinder. Main contributions from the present work are: Multi-dimensional simulation of combustion process inside the engine cylinder operating on producer gas was carried out to examine flame/flow field interactions. Two models based on FSD were first tested against present experimental results in constant volume combustion chamber. In CFM 2 model; a modification of replacing the arbitrary length scale by integral length scale with a limiting value near the wall was suggested to avoid prediction of abnormally large turbulent burning velocity near the wall. This combustion model has been implemented in ANSYS-CFX 10. The required data of laminar and turbulent burning velocities of producer gas-air mixture has been determined by experiments and computations at varied initial pressures and turbulent intensities. Finally, the simulated engine pressure data has been compared with earlier experimental data of the engine operating on producer gas. The proposed FSD model has the capability to match well with the experimental results except for the initial flame kernel development phase. Even though this issue needs to be resolved, the work has brought out the important interaction between the flame propagation and flow field within the bowl-in-piston engine cylinder...|$|R
