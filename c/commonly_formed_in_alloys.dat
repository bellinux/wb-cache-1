50|$|Hydrostatic (closed-system) pingos form as {{a result}} of {{hydrostatic}} pressure on water from permafrost, and <b>commonly</b> <b>form</b> <b>in</b> drained lakes or river channels. Permafrost rises to the drained body's former floor. Pore water is expelled in front of the rising permafrost, and the resulting pressure causes the frozen ground to rise and an ice core to form. The shape and size of a hydrostatic or closed system pingo is often similar to the body of water that it originated from. They can vary from symmetrical conical domes to asymmetric, elongate hills.|$|R

50|$|Graupel <b>commonly</b> <b>forms</b> <b>in</b> high-altitude climates and is both denser {{and more}} {{granular}} than ordinary snow, {{due to its}} rimed exterior. Macroscopically, graupel resembles small beads of polystyrene. The combination of density and low viscosity makes fresh layers of graupel unstable on slopes, and layers of 20 - 30 cm present {{a high risk of}} dangerous slab avalanches. In addition, thinner layers of graupel falling at low temperatures can act as ball bearings below subsequent falls of more naturally stable snow, rendering them also liable to avalanche. Graupel tends to compact and stabilise ("weld") approximately one or two days after falling, depending on the temperature and the properties of the graupel.|$|R

Commonly it has no definite form of its own, but fills up the irregular interspaces between the earlier crystallized minerals. The compositions of these residual crystallization products may represent eutectic compositions, the mixtures (quartz plus feldspar plus minor amounts of other minerals) which have the lowest fusion point. The texture may <b>commonly</b> <b>form</b> <b>in</b> {{the presence of a}} vapor phase as well as a silicate melt, however, and vapor-rock reactions below the solidus may result in feldspar replacement and consequent compositional changes.|$|R
40|$|Swift heavy ions lose energy {{primarily}} by inelastic electronic scattering and, above an energy threshold, electronic losses result in {{damage to the}} lattice. Such high energy radiation is beyond the range of validity of traditional cascade simulations, and predictive damage calculations are challenging. We use a novel methodology, which combines molecular dynamics with a consistent treatment of electronic energy transport and redistribution to the lattice, to model how swift heavy ions form damage tracks. We consider a range of material parameters (electron–phonon coupling strength, thermal conductivity and electronic specific heat) and show how these affect the maximum lattice temperature reached {{and the extent of}} residual damage. Our analysis also suggests that fission tracks may <b>form</b> <b>in</b> <b>alloys</b> of archaeological interest. (Some figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version) 1...|$|R
25|$|Si–C {{bonds are}} <b>commonly</b> <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> three ways. In the laboratory, {{preparation}} is often {{carried out in}} small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with organolithium, Grignard, or organoaluminium reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si–H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic copper as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, ammonolysis, alcoholysis, and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers.|$|R
50|$|Waterfalls are <b>commonly</b> <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> {{the upper}} {{course of a}} river in steep mountains. Because of their {{landscape}} position, many waterfalls occur over bedrock fed by little contributing area, so they are ephemeral and only occur during rainstorms. The further downstream, the more perennial a waterfall can be. It is even possible for waterfalls to occur far downstream due to transient discontinuities in a river's longitudinal profile caused by climatic changes and anthropogenic activities. Waterfalls can have {{a wide range of}} widths and depths, and this diversity is part of what makes them such a charismatic and interesting natural phenomenon. Research into the diversity of natural waterfalls systematics has been carried out in recent years.|$|R

40|$|Microstructural {{instability}} {{involving the}} formation of topologically close-packed (TCP) phases is restricted during the alloy development of Ni-based single crystal superalloys. In this study, the effects of alloying elements including Co, Cr, Mo and Ru on {{the formation of}} different TCP phases were investigated {{in a series of}} single crystal superalloys. Experimental results showed that more additions of Cr and Mo promoted the TCP phase formation, while Co and Ru played a positive role in improving microstructural stability. It is indicated that σ, P and R phases existed with various morphology and compositions <b>in</b> different experimental <b>alloys</b> during thermal exposure at 1100 [*]∘C. The content of Co, Cr and Mo <b>in</b> those <b>alloys</b> affected the types of TCP phases significantly, while Ru additions showed a negligible effect. R phase was prone to <b>form</b> <b>in</b> <b>alloys</b> containing high level of Co addition. Meanwhile, the ratio of Cr and Mo content had strong influence on the formation of σ and P phases <b>in</b> <b>alloys</b> containing low level of Co addition.

40|$|AbstractInclusion bodies (IBs) are <b>commonly</b> <b>formed</b> <b>in</b> Escherichia coli due to over {{expression}} of recombinant proteins in non-native state. Isolation, denaturation and refolding of these IBs is generally performed to obtain functional protein. However, {{during this process}} IBs tend to form non-specific interactions with sheared nucleic acids from the genome, thus getting carried over into downstream processes. This may hinder the refolding of IBs into their native state. To circumvent this, we demonstrate a methodology termed soni-removal which involves disruption of nucleic acid–inclusion body interaction using sonication; followed by solvent based separation. As opposed to conventional techniques that use enzymes and column-based separations, soni-removal is a cost effective alternative for complete elimination of buried and/or strongly bound short nucleic acid contaminants from IBs...|$|R
40|$|After aging for 16, 000 hr at 593 C, P {{phase was}} found at Alloy 22 grain boundaries. At higher {{temperatures}} (as much as 760 C for the same aging time), both {mu} and P phase formed on grain boundaries and within the grains. Grain boundary carbides also form at 593 C and higher, but the amount of carbide is small compared to the p and P phases. A small amount of sigma phase <b>forms</b> <b>in</b> <b>Alloy</b> 22 after 16, 000 hr at 704 and 760 C. LRO was seen after aging for 16, 000 hr at 593 C and for 40, 000 hr at 427 C, but ordering most likely begins at shorter times. More work must be done in phase identification. Samples aged at times less than 16, 000 hr must be examined so that the phase evolution during aging can be determined. A procedure being developed for phase extraction and x-ray diffraction should make phase identification and quantification of the relative amounts of each phase easier. The times at which various stages of intermetallic precipitation occur <b>in</b> <b>Alloy</b> 22 base metal displayed an exponential (Arrhenius-type) temperature dependence.

A more quantitative model based on precipitate volume fraction measurements that can be integrated over a variable temperature profile must be developed before a reasonable prediction of the phase stability of Alloy 22 base metal under repository conditions can be made. In addition, the effect of intermetallic and carbide precipitation on Alloy 22 properties must be determined. Precipitation kinetics in weld heat-affected zones, {{as well as in the}} base metal, must be studied because the thermal pulse given the HAZ during the welding process may alter nucleation of intermetallics and therefore the precipitation kinetics. Intermetallic and carbide precipitates <b>form</b> <b>in</b> <b>Alloy</b> 22 welds during the welding process. It will be verified that these phases do not have a detrimental effect on the relevant weld properties. The effect of aging on the precipitate volume fraction and average size and on weld properties must also be determined...|$|R

Recent efforts have focused on producing more uniform carbon nanotubes in controlled flame environments. Such methods have promise for large-scale, low-cost nanotube synthesis based on theoretical models, though they must compete with rapidly developing large scale CVD production.|$|R
