5000|$|Municipalities, {{especially}} in urban or residential areas, {{have been concerned}} at the pollution by concrete batching plants. [...] The absence of suitable dust collection and filter systems in cement silos or at the truck loading point is {{the major source of}} particulate matter emission in the air. The loading point is a large emission point for dust pollution, so many concrete producers utilize central dust collectors to contain this dust. Notably, many transit <b>mix</b> (dry loading) <b>plants</b> create significantly more dust pollution than <b>central</b> <b>mix</b> <b>plants</b> {{due to the nature of}} the batching process. A final source of concern for many municipalities is the presence of extensive water runoff and reuse for water spilled on a producer's sites.|$|R
5000|$|A Wet <b>mix</b> Concrete <b>Plants,</b> {{combines}} {{some or all}} of {{the above}} ingredients (including water) at a central location into a Concrete Mixer - that is, the concrete is mixed at a single point, and then simply agitated on the way to the jobsite to prevent setting (using agitors or ready mix trucks) or hauled to the jobsite in an open-bodied dump truck. Dry mix differ from Wet <b>mix</b> <b>plants</b> in that Wet <b>Mix</b> contain a <b>central</b> mixer whereas dry, which can offer a more consistent mixture in a shorter time (generally 5 minutes or less). Dry <b>mix</b> <b>plants</b> typically see more break strength standard deviation and variation from load to load because of inconsistencies in mix times, truck blade and drum conditions, traffic conditions, etc. With a <b>Central</b> <b>Mix</b> <b>plant,</b> all loads see the same mixing action and there is an initial quality control point when discharging from the central mixer. Certain plants combine both Dry and Wet characteristics for increased production or for seasonality. le A Mobile batch plant can be constructed on a large job site.|$|R

The original in situ method developed and evaluated herein requires installing a sampler, yet only slightly disturbs the production process. By using this calibration method the mixing power becomes a reliable online indication of concrete water content (measurement standard deviation of 2. 85 l/m 3).

40|$|Current {{environmental}} and economical circumstances accelerate the developments of new concrete constituents. Whereas the process technology impacts the mix-design strategy, {{it seems obvious}} that manufacturing process is prone to evolutions. This article presents a method to compare {{environmental and}} economical consequences of different technological solutions {{on the basis of}} the influence on the cement consumption needed for a given concrete performance. Case study is the choice of dry batch or <b>central</b> <b>mixed</b> concrete production systems for a ready mixed concrete production. The theoretical difference in cement consumption is estimated by considering that the water content fluctuation is by far the dominant factor governing the truck to truck variation. The addition of a mixer is effectively found to contribute to cement reduction. Environmental comparison is performed using an EADT indicator (Environmental Amortization Duration Time) defined in the article, and testing various environmental data. The EADT for energy consumption, released CO 2 and particles are found below 6 years, in the whole range of tested environmental data for an annual production of 40, 000 m 3 yr 1, with 2 m 3 mixer for the <b>central</b> <b>mixed</b> concrete <b>plant.</b> The NOx and SO 2 EADT results are found sensitive to the releases of the steel plant.

5000|$|A {{concrete}} plant, {{also known}} as a batch plant or batching plant or a concrete batching plant, is equipment that combines various ingredients to form concrete. Some of these inputs include water, air, admixtures, sand, aggregate (rocks, gravel, etc.), fly ash, silica fume, slag, and cement. There are two main types of concrete plants: Dry <b>mix</b> <b>plants</b> and Wet <b>mix</b> <b>plants,</b> and also plants that contain both a transit mix side and a <b>central</b> <b>mix</b> side while utilizing common material storage points. A concrete plant can have a variety of parts and accessories, including: mixers (either tilt drum or horizontal or in some cases both), cement batchers, aggregate batchers, conveyors, radial stackers, aggregate bins, cement bins, heaters, chillers, cement silos, batch plant controls, and dust collectors.|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} project involving 2, 3, 4, and 5 in. (5. 1, 7. 6, 10. 2, and 12. 7 cm) of bonded portland cement concrete (PCC) overlay on a 1. 3 mile (2. 1 km) PCC pavement {{was conducted in}} Clayton County, Iowa, during September 1977, centering on the following objectives: (1) Determine the mixing and proportioning procedures required in using a conventional, <b>central</b> <b>mix</b> proportioning <b>plant</b> to produce a dense PCC mixture using standard mixes with super water reducing admixtures; (2) Determine the economics, longevity and maintenance performance of a bonded, thin-lift, non-reinforced PCC resurfacing course using conventional procedures, equipment and concrete paving mixtures both with and without super water reducing admixtures; and (3) Determine if an adequate bond between the existing pavement and an overlay of thin-lift, dense, non-reinforced PCC can be obtained with only special surface cleaning and no surface removal or grinding. The conclusions are as follows: (1) Normal mixing equipment and proportioning procedures could be used using a conventional central-mix proportioning plant. This was successful when used with super water reducing admixtures. Only minor changes need be made in procedures and timing. (2) The time has been too short since {{the completion of the}} project to determine how the new pavement will perform, however, initially it appears that the method is economical and no reason is seen at this time why the life of the pavement should not be comparable to an all new pavement. (3) The initial test results show that bond strength, regardless of which method of cleaning is used, scarifying, sand blasting or water blasting, far exceed what is considered the minimum bond strength of 200 psi (1379 kPa) except where the paint stripes were intentionally left, thus showing that the paint must be removed. (4) It appears that either cement and water grout or sand, cement and water grout may be used and still obtain the required bond...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFlash floods, erratically {{striking}} semi-arid regions, often cause field {{flooding and}} soil anoxia, resulting in crop losses on food staples, typically pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Recent glasshouse {{studies have indicated}} that rice (Oryza spp.) can enhance flood stress tolerance of co-growing dryland cereals by modifying their rhizosphere microenvironments via the oxygen released from its roots into the aqueous rhizosphere. We tested whether this phenomenon would be expressed under field flood conditions. The effects of mix-planting of pearl millet and sorghum with rice on their survival, growth and grain yields were evaluated under controlled field flooding in semi-arid Namibia during 2014 / 2015 â 2015 / 2016. Single-stand and <b>mixed</b> <b>plant</b> treatments were subjected to 11 â 22 day flood stress at the vegetative growth stage. <b>Mixed</b> <b>planting</b> increased plant survival rates in both pearl millet and sorghum. Grain yields of pearl millet and sorghum were reduced by flooding, in both the single-stand and <b>mixed</b> <b>plant</b> treatments, relative to the non-flooded upland yields, but the reduction was lower in the <b>mixed</b> <b>plant</b> treatments. In contrast, flooding increased rice yields. Both pearl milletârice and sorghumârice mixtures demonstrated higher land equivalent ratios, indicating a <b>mixed</b> <b>planting</b> advantage under flood conditions. These results indicate that mix-planting pearl millet and sorghum with rice could alleviate flood stress on dryland cereals. The results also suggest that with this cropping technique, rice could compensate for the dryland cereal yield losses due to field flooding...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: On {{concrete}} dam construction work, {{it is necessary}} to manufacture a large amount of concrete and CSG (Cemented Sand and Gravel). The manufacture plant of concrete and CSG is operated in very long term, therefore the effect of its environmental impact could be serious. In general, {{there are two types of}} manufacture plant on the process of manufacturing concrete or CSG. The one is batch type plant; its mixing process is not continuous and {{it is necessary to}} repeat the processes of measuring and mixing every batch. The other is continuous mixing plant; mixing process is completely continuous, at the same time, the measurement and supplement of materials are also carried out continuously. Since continuous <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> can manufacture a large amount of products at short time, continuous <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> is suitable for manufacture plant of {{concrete dam}} construction. But it is hard to control the quality of products, so batch type plant used to be adopted as the mixer of the manufacture plant. In recent years, the new continuous <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> which can control the quality of products accurately has developed and been put to practical use on several projects of concrete and CSG dam construction. The best feature of this plant is its energy saving effect. This plant is equipped with a static continuous mixer for mixing concrete or CSG. This mixer is set up in vertical direction, and then it is possible to mix materials with no electric power but only by gravity force. In this study, environmental impact due to manufacture concrete and CSG by conventional batch type plant and new continuous <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> are estimated and compared, and then the advantage of new continues <b>mixing</b> <b>plant</b> for environment is discussed...|$|R
