50|$|The {{mixture is}} placed into a lined mold, <b>covered,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> {{in a water}} bath to control the temperature, which will keep the forcemeat from separating, as the water bath slows the heating process of the terrine. Pâté and terrine are {{generally}} cooked to 160°F (71°C), while terrine made of foie gras are generally cooked to an internal temperature of 120°F (59°C). After the proper temperature is reached, the terrine {{is removed from the}} oven and placed into a cooling unit topped with a weight to compact the contents of the terrine. It is then allowed to rest for several days to allow the flavors to blend.|$|R

5000|$|Most braises {{follow the}} same basic steps. The food to be braised (meats, vegetables, mushrooms, etc.) is first pan-seared to brown its surface and enhance its flavor (through the Maillard reaction). If the food will not produce enough liquid of its own, {{a certain amount of}} cooking liquid that often {{includes}} an acidic element (e.g., tomatoes, beer, balsamic vinegar, wine) is added to the pot, often with stock. A classic braise is done with a relatively whole cut of meat, and the braising liquid will cover two-thirds of the food in the pan. Then, the dish is <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> at a very low simmer, until the meat becomes so tender that it can be [...] "cut" [...] with just the gentlest of pressure from a fork (versus a knife). Often the cooking liquid is finished to create a sauce or gravy, as well.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the typical}} kuku sabzi recipe (as pictured), {{the eggs and}} herbs are mixed and {{seasoned}} with salt, black pepper, walnuts, sometimes flour, sometime barberries, sometimes baking powder and ground turmeric or adviyeh spice mixture. The mixture is then poured into a preheated oiled pan, <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> {{over low heat until}} set, sometimes flipped or finished in a hot oven. Some cooks saute the herbs briefly before adding the eggs. The amount of herb ingredient usually greatly exceeds the amount of egg, the egg merely serving to hold the kuku together, making the predominant flavor that of the herbs rather than that of a typical [...] "egg omelette." [...] Walnuts and zereshk (barberries) are a favorite garnish for on top. It is often sliced and served hot or cold with bread or rice, yogurt, sabzi khordan (platter of fresh herbs) and torshi (pickled vegetables). Kuku can be a main dish or an appetizer.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} documented {{recipe for}} a meat-based sauce (ragù) served with pasta comes from late 18th century Imola, near Bologna. Pellegrino Artusi published a {{recipe for a}} meat sauce characterized as being bolognese in his cookbook published in 1891. Artusi's recipe, which he called Maccheroni alla bolognese, is thought to derive from the mid 19th century when he spent considerable time in Bologna (maccheroni being a generic term for pasta, both dried and fresh). The recipe only partially resembles the ragù alla bolognese that is traditionally associated with tagliatelle. The sauce called for predominantly lean veal filet along with pancetta, butter, onion, and carrot. The meats and vegetables were to be finely minced, cooked with butter until the meats browned, then <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> with broth. Artusi commented that the taste could be made even more pleasant by adding small pieces of dried mushroom, a few slices of truffle, or chicken liver cooked with the meat and diced. As a final touch, he also suggested adding half a glass of cream to the sauce when it was completely done to make it taste even smoother. Artusi recommended serving this sauce with a medium size pasta ("horse teeth") made from durum wheat. The pasta was to be made fresh, cooked until it was firm, and then flavored with the sauce and Parmigiano cheese.|$|R
5000|$|The chefs {{then return}} to [...] "camp" [...] where they cook a three-course meal which is {{supposed}} to blend their own cooking style with traditional techniques and flavours from that culture. Each chef is allowed to bring a chef's knife and a single additional (non-traditional) ingredient. They prepare food with basic utensils at a <b>covered</b> bench <b>and</b> <b>cook</b> over an open fire. Their food is then served to a panel of 4 judges from that tribe or culture. Judges are given three colours tokens (each colour corresponds to a particular chef) and are asked by the host to cast a single vote for the chef they believes best represented their traditional cuisine. In each instance, a tribal leader is chosen who holds a casting vote {{in the event of a}} tie.|$|R

5000|$|The grated {{potatoes}} are squeezed out and {{mixed with the}} onions. Some of the doughy mixture that has formed is rolled into two sheets. One of the sheets {{is placed on the}} bottom of the dish and should be larger in diameter than it so as it comes out a fair bit. The remaining mixture is spiced with savory, poured on top of the first sheet, covered with the other sheet; the edges of both sheets should cover each other: in that respect, it resembles a [...] "potato banitsa". According to one of the preparation methods, the patatnik is turned over when the bottom is well <b>cooked</b> <b>and</b> slipped into the dish with the heated side. According to other recipes, no sheets are formed and instead the ingredients are mixed until they become homogeneous; these are then cooked in a deep dish on a slow fire. After 20 minutes the mixture is turned over <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> <b>and</b> then <b>cooked</b> further.|$|R

She took a considerable interest in the housework that our generally servantless condition put upon her--she used to have a charwoman in two or three times a week--but she did not do it with any great skill.

5000|$|Damper was {{originally}} developed by stockmen who travelled {{in remote areas}} for long periods, with only basic rations of flour, sugar and tea, supplemented by whatever meat was available. The basic ingredients of damper were flour, water, and sometimes milk. Baking soda {{could be used for}} leavening. The damper was normally cooked in the ashes of the camp fire. The ashes were flattened, and the damper was cooked there for ten minutes. Following this, the damper was <b>covered</b> with ashes <b>and</b> <b>cooked</b> for another 20 to 30 minutes until the damper sounded hollow when tapped. Alternatively, the damper was cooked in a greased camp oven. Damper was eaten with dried or cooked meat or golden syrup, also known as [...] "cocky's joy".|$|R
