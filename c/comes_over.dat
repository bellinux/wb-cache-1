As she and Sonia watch from the rooftop that Ajay proposed to her on, they have a vision of the boys running in the fields, singing happily and victoriously throwing their shirts in the air, acting as if they are celebrating life itself, as if the ebb of their once-there vitality still reverberates in the places where they once used to go, and a wave of melancholy <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> the two surviving women.|$|E

He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room and is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E

500|$|Bush's music, {{at least}} from the mid-1930s, often carried {{political}} overtones. His obituarist Rupert Christiansen writes that, as a principled Marxist, Bush [...] "put the requirements of the revolutionary proletariat {{at the head of the}} composer's responsibilities", a choice which others, such as Tippett, chose not to make. [...] However, Vaughan Williams thought that, despite Bush's oft-declared theories of the purposes of art and music, [...] "when the inspiration <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> him he forgets all about this and remembers only the one eternal rule for all artists, 'To thine own self be true'." ...|$|E

She notes that although much of his grand opera, Sita, is [...] "'good old Wagnerian bawling'... towards the end a change <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> the music, and the beautifully calm phrases of the hidden chorus representing the Voice of the Earth are in Holst's own language." ...|$|E

The film critic for Der Tagesspiegel wrote, [...] " [...] image {{as an actor}} has been finally ruined by Valkyrie... doesn't dare to be popcorn cinema {{and at the same}} time lacks any {{conceptual}} brilliance." [...] Hanns-Georg Rodek of Die Welt reported of Cruise's performance, [...] "He <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> best as an American hero, someone who battles for respect with aggression and energy. But Stauffenberg was a German hero, with aristocratic bearing, and Cruise cannot carry that off." [...] The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said Cruise's performance was [...] "credible", and reserved praise for the authenticity of the dubbed German-language version of the film over the original.|$|E

Nick Levine from Digital Spy commented in his positive review, [...] "'Headlines' won't be the first tune you skip to on the Spice Girls' Greatest Hits album – or, in all honesty, the tenth – but, as its pretty, gently melodic chorus surges gracefully, the feeling that <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> you is unmistakable.

But Rosa <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> to have sexual intercourse with Michael while Angie slaps Ida in the face with a gun. Michael and Carole decide to move out of Michael's parents' house and try to earn enough money to move to California, in order to avoid Shorty.

[...] A mixed review from Mid-Day [...] says [...] "Pradeep Sarkar weaves the story like magic, {{especially in the}} first half... excelling in the detailing... the vintage look of the film (that stood out) with authentic costumes, props and the roads of Kolkata". However, the review criticised the film's climax terming it as amateur, thereby diluting the whole film's impact. Another such review came from The Hindu which begins by saying [...] "A simple enough story, but Sarkar tells it well, with some great shots of Shekhar and Lalita together."

500|$|She {{wanted to}} play the title role in Mildred Pierce (1945), but Bette Davis was the studio's first choice. However, Davis turned the role down. Director Michael Curtiz did not want Crawford to play the part, and he instead lobbied for the casting of Barbara Stanwyck. Warner Bros went against Curtiz and cast Crawford in the film. Throughout the entire {{production}} of the movie, Curtiz criticized Crawford. He has been quoted as having told Jack L. Warner, [...] "She <b>comes</b> <b>over</b> here with her high-hat airs and her goddamn shoulder pads... why should I waste my time directing a has-been?" [...] Curtiz demanded Crawford prove her suitability by taking a screen test. She agreed. After the test, Curtiz agreed to Crawford's casting. Mildred Pierce was a resounding critical and commercial success. It epitomized the lush visual style and the hard-boiled film noir sensibility that defined Warner Bros. movies of the late forties, earning Crawford the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.|$|E
