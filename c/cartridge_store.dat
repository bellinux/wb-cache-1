50|$|The {{command post}} is a {{concrete}} building which comprises two rooms, one above the other, with observation slits cut at head height round three {{sides of the}} structure. Access to the building is from the northern side into the lower room and from the rear into the higher room. The gun emplacements are also built of concrete. The guns were protected by a cantilevered extension, with a shell store and <b>cartridge</b> <b>store</b> of reinforced concrete at the rear. Searchlight facilities are of similar construction without the rear store rooms. The road drainage system and curbing and guttering are of rock lined channels held in place with concrete. The level area below the command post {{is surrounded by a}} stone-pitched wall with concrete and stone steps. There is some evidence that the buildings were covered in camouflage paint. Some sections of the buildings have been painted in recent years in an attempt to cover graffiti.|$|E
50|$|In 1890 it was {{proposed}} {{to update the}} armament of the Stokes Bay defences by adding two 6-inch and two 9.2-inch B.L. guns {{at either end of}} the Bay. These guns formed the standard coast defence artillery of this period and always operated in pairs of complimentary guns to counter armoured and unarmoured ships (blockers). Fort Gilkicker was remodeled for two 6 inch and two 9.2-inch B.L. guns at the east end of the bay whilst Stokes Bay Lines No.2 Battery was remodeled to hold the western two 6-inch B.L. guns. Its complimentary guns, two 9.2-inch B.L. guns were to be fitted to Browndown Battery. The new battery had the usual shell and <b>cartridge</b> <b>store</b> between the two gun emplacements which were extended and enlarged from the old R.M.L.magazines. To the west of the magazines a cookhouse was added. Two crew shelters were also added in the extension. A Battery Command Post and telephone room were constructed above the Artillery Store at the west end. This communicated with the Battery Command post on No.2 Battery of the Stokes Bay Lines and with those at Fort Gilkicker.|$|E
50|$|By 1881 Admiralty Pier Fort {{was mostly}} {{complete}} {{and ready to}} receive its guns. The turret to hold the guns was constructed by the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company of Blackwall. This turret had a frame of wrought iron clad with three layers of 7-inch armour with 2-inch layers of iron and wood between them. Its weight including the two guns was 895 tons and it revolved on 32 rollers. The Thames Ironworks also built the machinery for the turret. There were four steam engines: The loading engine for loading running back and raising the ammunition, the main engine for rotating the turret, the auxiliary engine to replace either {{of the first two}} and the donkey engine which supplied water to the two boilers. In 1881 the Dover Telegraph reported on the proof trials of the turretâ€™s No.2 gun. At first it was proposed to move the guns to Dover by rail but this was considered to be too costly as a special carriage would be needed that would be useless for anything else. Eventually it was decided to move the guns by barge and use special sheers and holdfasts as anchors. The guns were lifted by manpower with a capstan instead of by machinery, permission being granted for this by the Board of Trade on condition that it all be removed as soon as possible after the guns were landed. An overhead traveller was constructed to move the guns across {{to the top of the}} turret and then lower them onto their carriages.The sheers weighed 100 tons and the traveller weighed 22 tons. They were tested in 1881 and the No.1 gun arrived on 4 December 1881. It was in place by 6 January 1882. The No.2 gun followed on 12 May 1882. The turret machinery was ready for testing at the beginning of 1883 and the testing was arranged for July. The first shot was fired using a 250 pound charge. A second shot followed using a 337 pound charge and finally three shots were fired using a full battering charge of four hundred and fifty pounds of powder. The cliffs did not fall down as predicted, and neither did the fort itself but a couple of panes of glass were broken in the nearby lighthouse. By 1884 more experiments at Dover Turret had taken place with the electric lighting of the turret and the firing gear of the two guns. In 1885 the pier-head had been extended to landward and within this a new shell store, a coal bunker and a new <b>cartridge</b> <b>store</b> were built. In 1886 the committee assembled at the turret to watch the guns being fired. Four rounds were fired and the committee reported that the turret was ready to be handed over to the Royal Artillery.|$|E

50|$|Designed by Captain E. H. Steward of the Royal Engineers, the {{circular}} fort was first planned in 1859. It was {{built as a}} result of the Royal Commission to guard the new Portland harbour and Royal Navy institutions on the island. Due to subsidence, the fort was constructed on a granite base, based on a 200 ft diameter ring of stone laid down on the seabed. The main floor consists of gun rooms and ports for 14 heavy guns. Below the gun floor are the shell and <b>cartridge</b> <b>stores</b> and engine rooms. The fort also has its own harbour and ancillary barrack buildings. The fort cost Â£75,968 to build.|$|R

5|$|The magazines, {{situated}} deep {{under the}} casemates, consist of alternating pairs of shell and cartridge rooms accessed via an ammunition passage {{at the front}} and a lighting passage behind. Great care was taken to reduce {{the possibility of an}} accidental explosion. The magazine workers wore special clothes and shoes to eliminate the risk of striking sparks and the floors of the <b>cartridge</b> <b>stores</b> were covered by wooden battens. The lighting was provided from oil lamps situated behind glass windows and accessed only from the lighting passage, which was physically separated {{from the rest of the}} magazine. Sets of lifting gear enabled the workers to winch the cartridges and ammunition up to the casemates, with which they could communicate via voice tubes.|$|R

50|$|The {{cabinetry}} {{was designed}} by the Italian automotive design firm Pininfarina, via their Pininfarina Extra industrial and product design subsidiary. Technologies involved include microdispensing technology and proprietary PurePour technology. Both technologies were originally developed to deliver precise doses of drugs. One Freestyle unit with a similar footprint to a current vending machine can dispense 126 kinds of carbonated and non-carbonated beverages. Microdosing blends one or more concentrated ingredients in 46 USfloz L packets with water and sweetener {{at the point where}} the beverage is dispensed, thus avoiding the use of traditional 5 usgal L boxes of syrup (also known as a bag-in-a-box). <b>Cartridges</b> <b>store</b> concentrated ingredients in the dispenser cabinet and are RFID enabled. The machine uses RFID chips to detect its supplies and to radio resupplying needs to other units. The machines transmit supply and demand data to both Coca-Cola and the owner including brands sold, times of the day of sales, troubleshooting information, and service data. The traditional ice cube dispenser remains.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was also}} {{distinguished}} by {{a relatively high}} data transfer rate: 3 megabytes per second. This was because {{it was able to}} read and write linear data across 18 recording tracks simultaneously, or 38,000 bytes per inch of tape. IBM's prior technology employed 9 recording tracks with a data density of 6,250 bytes per inch of tape, so the 3480 format was greeted as a major breakthrough. The IBM 3480 <b>cartridge</b> <b>stored</b> 200 megabytes in a modest 4x5 inch cartridge compared to the previous technology's 140 megabytes on a 10.5 inch diameter (2400 foot length) reel of 1/2" [...] tape. The 3480 and its successors are streaming drives. The 3480 was initially a disaster, because it would consistently underrun as the 3 MB/s bus and tag channels and the 3 MB/s drives could not feed the 3MB/s second tape drives because of various interferences such as seeks. The streaming drives would then have to stop, back up and restart, reducing throughput to under 200 KB/s.|$|R
