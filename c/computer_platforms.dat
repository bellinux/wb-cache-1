5|$|Metal Gear is a stealth action {{video game}} series created by Hideo Kojima and {{developed}} {{and published by}} Konami. The series debuted in Japan on July 12, 1987 with Metal Gear {{and is one of}} Konami's best-selling franchises, with over 26.5 million units sold. The games take place in a semi-fictional universe with stories that involve a special forces agent (Solid Snake in most games) who is forced to destroy the latest incarnation of the superweapon Metal Gear, as well as having to rescue various hostages and neutralize certain renegade units in the process. Metal Gear titles have been released on numerous video game consoles, handheld game consoles, and personal <b>computer</b> <b>platforms.</b> Related novels, comics, and other dramatizations have also been released.

25|$|The Unix {{operating}} system was conceived and implemented in 1969 at AT's Bell Laboratories in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language, as was common {{practice at the}} time. Later, in a key pioneering approach in 1973, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different <b>computer</b> <b>platforms</b> easier.|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of automatic control and communication technology, communication-based train control system is adopted by more and more urban mass transit system to automatically supervise the train speed to follow a desired trajectory. Taking reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety into consideration, 2 [*]×[*] 2 -out-of- 2 safety <b>computer</b> <b>platform</b> is usually utilized as the hardware platform of safety-critical subsystem in communication-based train control. To enhance the safety integrity level of safety <b>computer</b> <b>platform,</b> safety-related logics have to be verified before integrating them into practical systems. Therefore, a significant problem of developing safety <b>computer</b> <b>platform</b> is how to guarantee that system behaviors will satisfy the function requirements as well as responding to external events and processes within the limit of right time. Based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of function and timing characteristics, this article introduces a formal modeling and verification approach for this real-time system. In the proposed method, timed automata network model for 2 [*]×[*] 2 -out-of- 2 safety <b>computer</b> <b>platform</b> is built, and system requirements are specified and formalized as computation tree logic properties which can be verified by UPPAAL model checker...|$|R
25|$|Geomodelling and CAD share a lot {{of common}} technologies. Software is usually {{implemented}} using object-oriented programming technologies in C++, Java or C# on one or multiple <b>computer</b> <b>platforms.</b> The graphical user interface generally consists of one or several 3D and 2D graphics windows to visualize spatial data, interpretations and modelling output. Such visualization is generally achieved by exploiting graphics hardware. User interaction is mostly performed through mouse and keyboard, although 3D pointing devices and immersive environments {{may be used in}} some specific cases. GIS (Geographic Information System) is also a widely used tool to manipulate geological data.|$|E
25|$|Home {{consoles}} of {{the early}} 1980s generally lack hardware support for background scrolling — except for the Atari 2600 (with only vertical scrolling), Atari 5200 and Emerson Arcadia 2001, and notwithstanding Japan's Famicom. Nevertheless, Sierra On-Line released B.C.'s Quest For Tires in 1983 on the ColecoVision and several home <b>computer</b> <b>platforms.</b> The game features large, smooth-scrolling levels and simplistic platform gameplay in which players jump over oncoming pitfalls and obstacles, much like Moon Patrol. Not long after this, a scrolling platform game appeared on the Commodore 64 and Atari 800 computers called Snokie. It began {{to bridge the gap}} between these earlier scrolling arcade-style games and implements a more mature vision of the genre, with uneven terrain and an emphasis on precision jumping.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{revolution}} {{came in the}} late 1990s, which saw the rise of optical disks in fifth generation consoles. The implications for RPGs were enormous—longer, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was first clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of Final Fantasy VII, which {{is considered one of}} the most influential games of all time. With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million, the ambitious scope of Final Fantasy VII raised the possibilities for the genre, with its dozens of minigames and much higher production values. The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds, battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay, effectively integrated throughout the game. The game was soon ported to the PC and gained much success there, as did several other originally console RPGs, blurring the line between the console and <b>computer</b> <b>platforms.</b>|$|E

Upon its first release, it rivaled competing engines like LucasArts' SCUMM and Sierra's Creative Interpreter, due to its then high level of artificial intelligence. The engine was first proposed in 1989, while the first game to use it, Lure of the Temptress, was released in 1992, followed by Beneath a Steel Sky (1994), [...] (1996) and [...] (1997).|$|E

In late 1992, Commodore released the “next-generation” Amiga 1200, a machine closer in concept to the original Amiga 500, but featuring significant technical improvements. Despite this, neither the A1200 nor the A600 replicated the commercial success of its predecessor, as by this time, the popular market was definitively shifting from the home <b>computer</b> <b>platforms</b> of the past to commodity Wintel PCs and the new [...] "low-cost" [...] Macintosh Classic, LC and IIsi models.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{sizes of}} floppy disks are {{mechanically}} incompatible, and disks can fit only one size of drive. Drive assemblies with both 3½-inch and 5¼-inch slots were available {{during the transition}} period between the sizes, but they contained two separate drive mechanisms. In addition, there are many subtle, usually software-driven incompatibilities between the two. 5¼-inch disks formatted for use with Apple II computers would be unreadable and treated as unformatted on a Commodore. As <b>computer</b> <b>platforms</b> began to form, attempts were made at interchangeability. For example, the [...] "Superdrive" [...] included from the Macintosh SE to the Power Macintosh G3 could read, write and format IBM PC format 3½-inch disks, but few IBM-compatible computers had drives that did the reverse. 8-inch, 5¼-inch and 3½-inch drives were manufactured {{in a variety of}} sizes, most to fit standardized drive bays. Alongside the common disk sizes were non-classical sizes for specialized systems.|$|E
2500|$|His {{next project}} was the graphic {{adventure}} game Snatcher, released for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2 <b>computer</b> <b>platforms</b> in Japan in [...] The game, influenced by science fiction {{works such as}} Blade Runner, The Terminator, and Bubblegum Crisis, {{is set in a}} post-apocalyptic world and centers around an amnesiac detective who faces a race of cyborgs (the titular Snatchers) that kill their victims, copy their likeness and assume their place in society. While Kojima and his team wrote the entire story of the game, they were forced to leave out the final act of the game due to time constraints. The game was highly regarded at the time for pushing the boundaries of video game storytelling, cinematic cut scenes, and mature content, and was praised for its graphics, soundtrack, high quality writing comparable to a novel, voice acting comparable to a film or radio drama, post-apocalyptic setting, light gun shooter segments, and in-game computer database with optional documents that flesh out the game world. The Sega CD version of Snatcher was for a long time the only major visual novel game to be released in America. However, partly due to a Teen rating limiting its accessibility, it only sold a [...] "couple of thousand units", according to Jeremy Blaustein, a member of Snatchers localization team.|$|E
