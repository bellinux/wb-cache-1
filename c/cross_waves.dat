Optimal shape of hydraulic structure causes increasing their performance. In this study, {{the effect of}} geometries of guide walls on the flow pattern and rating curve of Balaroud dam spillway’s (Iran) was simulated using numerical and physical simulation. Numerical simulation of flow pattern through the guide walls was carried out using Flow 3 D software as computational fluid dynamic (CFD) tool. To this task, three plans for the guide walls were evaluated. The {{results showed that the}} plan (3) has best performance for removing <b>cross</b> <b>waves</b> and smoothly passing the flow through the approach channel and over the spillway. Evaluating the turbulence models showed that the RNG-K-epsilon becomes the best performance to show the <b>cross</b> <b>waves...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: "Tests were {{conducted}} on a 1 : 50 -scale model of Isabella Dam Spillway to determine the adequacy of proposed spillway, dam, and channel improvements. The model reproduced {{an area of the}} reservoir 800 ft wide by 1, 100 ft long, the spillway, and {{the entire length of the}} exit channel. Unsatisfactory flow conditions were observed in the vicinity of the spillway crest due to approach conditions to the spillway. Large <b>cross</b> <b>waves,</b> present in the exit channel just downstream of the spillway, resulted in occasional overtopping of the right wall. A grouted rock dike that provided satisfactory flow conditions at the spillway and downstream throughout the exit channel was placed adjacent to the existing spillway approach wall. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to review the {{reflective}} properties of multilayer ferromagnet for surface spin waves. It was calculated the reflection coefficient of surface spin waves from multilayer ferromagnet with uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in non-ideal boundary conditions at the interface between layers. The problem is solved in the exchange approximation. Graphics shows us the dependence of the reflection coefficient on the frequency, of the external magnetic field, the exchange interaction constant and uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. It was found the strong dependence of the reflectance of the surface spin waves from these parameters, and also on the value of exchange stiffness that is well observed in its small value. There are characteristic for multilayer structures as prohibited zones and zones of <b>cross</b> <b>waves.</b> Changing the values of the wave frequency, the value of an external constant homogeneous magnetic field, constant exchange interaction and uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, it is possible to achieve the desired values of the reflection coefficient. ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ??? ????????????? ???????? ????. ? ???? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ????????? ????????????? ???????? ???? ?? ?????????????? ?????????????? ? ????????? ????????? ???????????? ??? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ?? ??????? ??????? ?????. ?????? ?????? ? ???????? ???????????. ????????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????, ???????? ???????? ?????????? ????, ????????? ????????? ?????????????? ? ????????? ????????? ???????????. ?????????? ??????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????? ????????????? ???????? ????? ?? ????????????? ??????????, ? ????? ?? ???????? ???????? ?????????, ??? ?????? ??????????? ??? ?? ????? ????????. ?????????? ??????????? ??? ???????????? ???????? ??????????? ???? ? ???? ???????????? ????. ??????? ???????? ??????? ?????, ???????? ???????? ??????????? ??????????? ?????????? ????, ?????????? ????????? ?????????????? ? ????????? ????????? ???????????, ????? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The Wiggins-Holmes {{extension}} of the generalized Melnikov method (GMM) is applied to weakly damped parametrically excited <b>cross</b> <b>waves</b> with surface tension in a long rectangular wave channel {{in order to determine}} if these <b>cross</b> <b>waves</b> are chaotic. The Lagrangian density function for surface waves with surface tension is simplified by transforming the volume integrals to surface integrals and by subtracting the zero variation integrals. The Lagrangian is written in terms of the three generalized coordinates (or, equivalently the three degrees of freedom) that are the time-dependent components of the velocity potential. A generalized dissipation function is assumed to be proportional to the Stokes material derivative of the free surface. The generalized momenta are calculated from the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian is determined from a Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian. The first order ordinary differential equations derived from the Hamiltonian are usually suitable for the application of the GMM. However, the cross wave equations of motion must be transformed in order to obtain a suspended system for the application of the GMM. Only three canonical transformations that preserve the dynamics of the cross wave equations of motion are made because of an {{extension of}} the Herglotz algorithm to nonautonomous systems. This extension includes two distinct types of the generalized Herglotz algorithm (GHA). The system of nonlinear nonautonomous evolution equations determined from Hamilton's equations of motion of the second kind are averaged in order to obtain an autonomous system. The unperturbed system is analyzed to determine hyperbolic saddle points that are connected by heteroclinic orbits The perturbed Hamiltonian system that includes surface tension satisfies the KAM nondegeneracy requirements; and the Melnikov integral is calculated to demonstrate that the motion is chaotic. For the perturbed dissipative system with surface tension, the Melnikov integral is identically zero implying that a higher dimensional GMM is necessary in order to demonstrate by the GMM that the motion is chaotic. However, numerical calculations of the largest Liapunov characteristic exponent demonstrate that the perturbed dissipative system with surface tension is also chaotic. A chaos diagram is computed in order to search for possible regions of the damping parameter and the Floquet parametric forcing parameter where chaotic motions may exist...|$|E
40|$|For {{sufficiently}} directionally spread surface {{gravity wave}} groups, the set-down of the wave-averaged free surface, first described by Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 13, 1962, pp. 481 – 504), {{can turn into}} a set-up. Using a multiple-scale expansion for two <b>crossing</b> <b>wave</b> groups, we examine the structure and magnitude of this wave-averaged set-up, {{which is part of}} a <b>crossing</b> <b>wave</b> pattern that behaves as a modulated partial standing wave: in space, it consists of a rapidly varying standing-wave pattern slowly modulated by the product of the envelopes of the two groups; in time, it grows and decays on the slow time scale associated with the translation of the groups. Whether this <b>crossing</b> <b>wave</b> pattern actually enhances the surface elevation at the point of focus depends on the phases of the linear wave groups, unlike the set-down, which is always negative and inherits the spatial structure of the underlying envelope(s). We present detailed laboratory measurements of the wave-averaged free surface, examining both single wave groups, varying the degree of spreading from small to very large, and the interaction between two wave groups, varying both the degree of spreading and the crossing angle between the groups. In both cases, we find good agreement between the experiments, our simple expressions for the set-down and set-up, and existing second-order theory based on the component-by-component interaction of individual waves with different frequencies and directions. We predict and observe a set-up for wave groups with a Gaussian angular amplitude distribution with standard deviations of above (for energy spectra), which is relatively large for realistic sea states, and for crossing sea states with angles of separation of and above, which are known to occur in the ocean...|$|R

The traditional geometrical optics pair of equations suffer from the fact that the class of physically relevant solutions is limited.

The new equations are based on the same high frequency approximation of the scalar wave equation as the eikonal and the transport equations. However, they also incorporate a finite superposition principle. The maximum allowed number of intersecting waves in the solution can be chosen arbitrarily, but a higher number means that a larger system of PDEs must be solved. The PDEs form a hyperbolic system of conservation laws with source terms. Altho [...] ...|$|R
