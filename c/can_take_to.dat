5|$|Though tornadoes {{can strike}} in an instant, there are {{precautions}} and preventative measures that people <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> {{increase the chances}} of surviving a tornado. Authorities such as the Storm Prediction Center advise having a pre-determined plan should a tornado warning be issued. When a warning is issued, going to a basement or an interior first-floor room of a sturdy building greatly increases chances of survival. In tornado-prone areas, many buildings have storm cellars on the property. These underground refuges have saved thousands of lives.|$|E

The best physical characteristics of dog food to contribute to cleaning a dog's teeth would be food that is large and dense, that way there is more time spent chewing which leads {{to the surface of the}} teeth being cleaned.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{measures}} vessels <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> {{protect themselves}} against piracy are air-pressurised boat stopping systems which can fire {{a variety of}} vessel-disabling projectiles, [...] implementing a high freewall and vessel boarding protection systems (e.g., hot water wall, electricity-charged water wall, automated fire monitor, slippery foam). Ships can also attempt to protect themselves using their Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). Every ship over 300 tons carries a transponder supplying both information about the ship itself and its movements. Any unexpected change in this information can attract attention. Previously this data could only be picked up {{if there was a}} nearby ship, thus rendering single ships vulnerable. However, special satellites have been launched recently that are now able to detect and retransmit this data. Large ships cannot therefore be hijacked without being detected. This can act as a deterrent to attempts to either hijack the entire ship or steal large portions of cargo with another ship since an escort can be sent more quickly than might otherwise have been the case.|$|E

2500|$|Dermatopathology is a {{subspecialty}} of anatomic pathology {{that focuses}} on the skin {{and the rest of the}} integumentary system as an organ. [...] It is unique, in that there are two paths a physician <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> obtain the specialization. [...] All general pathologists and general dermatologists train in the pathology of the skin, so the term dermatopathologist denotes either of these who has reached a certainly level of accreditation and experience; in the USA, either a general pathologist or a dermatologist can undergo a 1 to 2 year fellowship in the field of dermatopathology. [...] The completion of this fellowship allows one to take a subspecialty board examination, and becomes a board certified dermatopathologist. Dermatologists are able to recognize most skin diseases based on their appearances, anatomic distributions, and behavior. Sometimes, however, those criteria do not lead to a conclusive diagnosis, and a skin biopsy is taken to be examined under the microscope using usual histological tests. In some cases, additional specialized testing needs to be performed on biopsies, including immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and molecular-pathologic analysis. [...] One of the greatest challenges of dermatopathology is its scope. More than 1500 different disorders of the skin exist, including cutaneous eruptions ("rashes") and neoplasms. Therefore, dermatopathologists must maintain a broad base of knowledge in clinical dermatology, and be familiar with several other specialty areas in Medicine.|$|E
2500|$|The dunes are {{separated}} into uplands and wetlands habitats. [...] Uplands include the fore dunes, back dunes, and sandy beaches. [...] Dunes {{can occur in}} three different formations. [...] Primary Foredunes are parallel to the shore and support sparse vegetation. [...] Parabolic dunes are [...] "U" [...] shaped and perpendicular to the shore with vegetative ridges. [...] Moving sand sheets consist of constantly moving sand, making it hard for vegetation to settle. The fore dunes begin at the high tide line, where only low growing plants with deep root systems (such as sand verbena) can live. The strong winds, salt spray, and massive amounts of sand make this area uninhabitable for other types of plants. [...] Plants in the dunes adapt growth forms to survive high winds. [...] Some grow {{close to the ground}} to avoid the wind and others adopt a Krummholz growth form. [...] The back dunes, just behind the fore dunes, are stabilized and covered with plants. The back dunes are dominated by shrub species like mock heather, dune lupine, coastal buckwheat, and blochman's senecio. The sandy beaches are a harsh environment with no plants able to survive there. [...] The wetlands include the areas that contain water: salt marshes, fresh and brackish-water marshes, swamps, and mudflats. [...] Plants that live there are adapted to dynamic environmental conditions including high salinity concentration and extreme temperatures. [...] Solutions that the plants <b>can</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> adapt to high salinity are large tap roots to reach the perched water table, thick cuticle to prevent water loss, and succulence.|$|E
