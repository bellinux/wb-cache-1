25|$|Coffee beans may {{be ground}} in several ways. A burr grinder uses {{revolving}} elements to shear the seed; a blade grinder cuts the seeds with blades moving at high speed; and {{a mortar and}} <b>pestle</b> <b>crushes</b> the seeds. For most brewing methods a burr grinder is deemed superior because the grind is more even and the grind size can be adjusted.|$|R
5000|$|Lyutika (лютика, [...] ) is a {{traditional}} vegetable mixture — salad or chunky relish, popular {{in the northern part}} of Bulgaria. It is consumed in the summer. Basic lyutika is made from roasted peppers, tomatoes, garlic, onions, and vegetable oil usually <b>crushed</b> with a <b>pestle</b> in a mortar. Often chopped parsley is added. Lyutika is served cold. The name comes from the pungent taste (lyut, meaning hot, pungent).|$|R
30|$|The {{determination}} of hemoglobin in CAM sections {{was done by}} the Drabkin and Austin [24] assay method. The dissected CAM sections were <b>crushed</b> with a <b>pestle</b> and mortar. The pilate was mixed with 5  ml of cooled normal salt solution and then homogenized. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 2500  rpm for 30  min. 3  mL of Drabkin reagent was added to 1  mL of supernatant. The reaction was incubated at room temperature (27 [*]±[*] 3  °C) for 20  min and the absorbance measured at 580  nm using a UV spectrophotometer (Evolution 60 S, USA). All tests were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility of the result.|$|R
30|$|The {{sample for}} the clay mineral {{analysis}} was gently <b>crushed</b> with a <b>pestle</b> and mortar, and the 2 -μm clay size fractions {{were separated by}} gravity settling and concentrated by centrifuge before being pipetted onto glass slides to make oriented slides. The measurement conditions of the RINT 2000 X-ray diffractometer (Tokyo Gakugei University) were the following: CuKa radiation at 40  kV and 20  mA, step-scan speed of 0.01 ° 2 θ/s, divergence and scatter slits of 1 °, receiving slit of 0.3  mm, and scan range of 6.5 to 10.5 Δ° 2 θ. Samples were treated with ethylene glycol to minimize the overlapping effect of smectite peaks.|$|R
30|$|DNA from AMF spores was {{extracted}} by the Chelex method {{as described}} by Simon (1996) with some modifications. Spores representing {{the whole range of}} morphological diversity were placed in Eppendorf tube with 50  μL of distilled water and <b>crushed</b> with blue <b>pestles</b> before and after adding 50  μL of 20 % Chelex- 100. Then, the samples were incubated at 85 °C for 3  min followed by a short vortex and incubation in ice for 5  min. This heating-cooling cycle was repeated twice; and subsequently, the samples were incubated at 60 °C for 90  min followed by centrifugation at 13, 000  rpm for 5  min. The supernatant was collected and immediately processed for PCR amplification. The samples were stored at − 80 °C until used in subsequent molecular analysis.|$|R
5000|$|In Paraguay, western Brazil (Mato Grosso do Sul, west of São Paulo) and the Argentine littoral, a mate infusion, called [...] in Spanish and Portuguese or [...] in Portuguese in {{southern}} regions of Brazil, is also consumed {{as a cold}} or iced beverage, usually sucked out of a horn cup called [...] with a [...] [...] can be prepared with cold water (the most common way in Paraguay and Brazil), or fruit juice (the most common way in Argentina). The version with water is more bitter; fruit juice acts as a sweetener (in Brazil, that is usually avoided {{with the addition of}} table sugar). Medicinal or culinary herbs, known as [...] (weeds), may be <b>crushed</b> with a <b>pestle</b> and mortar, and added to the water for taste or medicinal reasons.

30|$|All the electrocatalysts were {{synthesized}} {{using the}} deposition method by chemical reduction of NaBH 4. The 20  wt% of PtRu with the atomic ratio 1 : 1 is loaded onto different catalyst supports, which are synthesized support, TiO 2 -CNF, and another three commercial supports, C, CNF and TiO 2. A mixture of deionized water (DI water) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) {{was added to}} the support material and sonicated for 30  min. The precursors were mixed into the support mixture and were continuously stirred for another 30  min until the solution was well mixed. The pH value of the solution was adjusted to 8 using a 1  M NaOH solution. Then, the temperature of the solution was increased to 80  °C. A 25 -mL volume of a 0.2 -M solution of NaBH 4 was added dropwise into the solution and stirred for an additional hour. The mixture was cooled, filtered, and repeatedly washed with DI water. The electrocatalyst powder was dried for 3  h at 120  °C under a vacuum and <b>crushed</b> with a <b>pestle</b> and mortar to obtain a fine powder.|$|R
30|$|The {{morphology}} of the ZnO-Au nanoparticles {{was analyzed}} by {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM, JEM- 100 CX), whereas the structure was characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD, X'Pert Pro, PANalytical B.V., Almelo, The Netherlands; λ[*]=[*] 1.54056 Å) using Cu Kα radiation. An Avatar 360 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectrometer (Nicolet Company, Madison, WI, USA) was applied to perform the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy investigation. In the FTIR studies, the washed ZnO-Au nanoparticles and the pure PEO-PPO-PEO polymer employed in the preparation were <b>crushed</b> with a <b>pestle</b> in an agate mortar, the individually crushed material was mixed with potassium bromide (IR spectroscopy grade) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in about 1 : 100 proportion. The mixture was then compressed into a 2 -mm semitransparent disk by applying a force of 10 t for 2 min. The FTIR spectra were recorded at the wavelength range of 400 to 4, 000 cm- 1. Moreover, the optical properties of the ZnO-Au nanoparticles separately dispersed in hexane, ethanol, and water, together with the Au and ZnO nanoparticles in hexane, were characterized by an UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-vis near IR spectrophotometer, Hitachi U 4100; Hitachi, Shanghai, China) and a photoluminescence (PL) spectrophotometer (Hitachi F 7000, Japan).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{production}} of gallium lanthanum sulphide (GLS) microspheres and their potential uses. Microspheres, and micro-resonators in general, have attracted considerable attention because of their promise in all-optical-switching, micro-lasers, multiplexers and many other applications. In this thesis, several applications have been investigated, culminating in the demonstration of laser action in a neodymium doped GLS microsphere. The method of microsphere production used here was to drop crushed glass through a vertical furnace purged with an inert gas, typically argon. Bulk glass was crushed to a suitable size and uniformity before microsphere production. The glass was <b>crushed</b> with a <b>pestle</b> and mortar, and sieved to achieve glass particles of the required size. Systems have been designed and developed {{for the production of}} microspheres and these have resulted in microspheres with diameters from 0. 5 μm up to 580 μm being achieved. The failure to confirm spheres of a smaller size than this owes more to the equipment used to analyze the samples rather than a lack of spheres themselves. The material that has passed through the furnace will typically contain a mixture of particles that have melted into spheres and particles that have not. A system has been put in place to separate spherical particles from non-spherical ones. Together these production and separation systems have resulted in the reliable and reproducible production of microspheres in GLS as well as other types of glass. The quality of a resonator is quantified in its Q-factor. This can be measured by coupling light into a microsphere and observing the spectral intensity of scattered light. Using this method GLS microspheres were shown experimentally to have a Q-factor of up to 1. 2 x 10 ^ 5 at a wavelength of 1. 5 μm. It is also possible to calculate a maximum theoretical Q-factor for a given material, from its attenuation. By using data for the theoretical minimum attenuation of GLS /GLSO a maximum possible Q-factor has been calculated as over 4 x 10 ^ 10 in GLSO at 3 μm and 10 ^ 9 at 1 μm. Similarly by using attenuation measurements made on state of the art GLSO a maximum Q factor of 10 ^ 7 at 1 μm was calculated. The possibility of using microspheres as ball lenses has been investigated and shown to be possible. Laser action was observed in a neodymium doped GLS microsphere. The laser had a threshold of 83 mW of incident pump power, with a peak at 1082 nm and a line width of < 0. 05 nm...|$|R
