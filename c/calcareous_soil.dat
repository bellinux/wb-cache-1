5|$|The fungus {{probably}} favours <b>calcareous</b> <b>soil,</b> {{although it}} has been found on nearly every soil type. It appears on sand, peat, limestone soils, rankers and Cambisols. It endures acidic as well as alkaline and low-nutrient to relatively high-nutrient soils. Heavily eutrophic soils are inappropriate for its habitat.|$|E
5|$|Like most earthstars, G.quadrifidum is a {{saprobic}} fungus, {{and spends}} most of its life cycle as thin strands of mycelium, deriving nutrients by decomposing leaf litter and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic matter in the soil. The fungal fruit bodies are generally found in coniferous woodland, where they appear in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it was found in tropical thorn forest and pine-oak forest in the summer. In Britain, all collections {{have been made in}} beech forest on <b>calcareous</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E

500|$|With its reddish-brown wooly cap, white gills, {{and hollow}} stipe, Tricholoma vaccinum {{is a fairly}} {{distinct}} mushroom and {{is unlikely to be}} confused with other Tricholoma. Tricholoma imbricatum somewhat resembles T.vaccinum, but has duller brown colors, is less robust in stature, and has a solid (not hollow) stalk. Another lookalike, T.inodermeum, has a less woolly cap texture and flesh that turns bright pinkish red when injured. It associates solely with pine species and prefers <b>calcareous</b> <b>soil.</b> [...] Other brownish Tricholoma species include T.fracticum, T.dryophilum, and T.muricatum. The scaly and fibrous cap surface of T.vaccinum might be confused with Inocybe, but species in this genus can be distinguished by their brown spore prints.|$|E

30|$|To {{examine whether}} the transformants have {{enhanced}} tolerance to low Fe availability, the plants were cultured in pots filled with <b>calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> (pH  8.5 – 9.0; [61]) under controlled conditions in a greenhouse. Of the 36 gNAAT lines evaluated, ten showed remarkable tolerance to <b>calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> [61]. Nontransformants exhibited reduced growth and severe leaf chlorosis caused by Fe deficiency, whereas the gNAAT lines had greener and larger shoots. At harvest, the gNAAT lines possessed 4.2 and 4.1 times higher shoot dry weight and grain yield per pot than the nontransformants [61]. We also examined tolerance in <b>calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> {{for the other}} transformants. We found rice lines showing some tolerance to <b>calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> from all transgenes (a)–(g). In these lines, increased amounts or kinds of MAs secreted were thought to have contributed to enhanced Fe availability under Fe-limiting conditions.|$|R

500|$|The woolly cap margin, pinkish tones in the cap, acrid latex, and {{association}} with birch are reliable field characteristics {{to help identify}} L.torminosus. However, there are several hairy Lactarius species with which it is often confused, and sometimes examination of microscopic characteristics is necessary to distinguish between them. The closely related L.torminosus is a dwarf version of L.torminosus, an arctic species associated with the birches Betula nana or B.glandulosa. Immature fruit bodies of L.scrobiculatus resemble L.torminosus, {{but they have a}} white latex that soon turns yellow upon exposure to air, and their stems have shiny depressed spots. The caps of the poorly known species L.cilicioides are not zonate, and its spores are smaller. L.pubescens is physically quite similar, but can be distinguished by its paler color and smaller spores (6.0–7.5 by 5.0–6.5μm). L.controversus has a cap margin that is not as hairy, whitish to cream-colored gills, and larger spores measuring 7.5–10 by 6–7.5μm. L.mairei has a coloration similar to L.torminosus, but is rarer and typically found associated with oak trees on <b>calcareous</b> <b>soil.</b> [...] Known only from North Carolina and western Canada, L.subtorminosus was named for its similarity to L.torminosus. It can be distinguished by its mild-tasting latex and smaller, roughly spherical spores measuring 5.5–7 by 5.5–6.5μm.|$|E
2500|$|Theophilus {{recommends}} {{the use of}} beech logs, which analysis has shown has {{a high proportion of}} CaO when grown on <b>calcareous</b> <b>soil.</b> [...] Whatever wood is used, the amount of potash and CaO it provides, as well as other components that might affect colour and opacity, varies considerably with the age and part of the tree, soil chemistry, climate, {{the time of year when}} the tree was cut and the dryness of the wood when burned, factors over which the glassmaker had little control. This variability explains the problems that glassmakers had in trying to produce glass of a consistent quality. Large amounts of ash would have to be prepared and mixed together to give the homogeneity needed to give a predictable glass composition. A typical yield of ash from beech is only about 1%, so using Theophilus' recipe of two parts of sand to one part of ash means it would take 63kg of beech wood to produce one kilo of glass. It has been estimated that, including fuel, 150–200kg of wood would be needed per kilo of glass.|$|E
2500|$|All Chablis is made 100% {{from the}} Chardonnay grape. Some wine experts, such as Jancis Robinson, {{believe that the}} wine from Chablis {{is one of the}} [...] "purest" [...] {{expressions}} of the varietal character of Chardonnay, because of the simple style of winemaking favored in this region. Chablis winemakers want to emphasize the terroir of the <b>calcareous</b> <b>soil</b> and cooler climate that help maintain high acidity. Chablis wines are characterized by their greenish-yellow color and clarity. The racy, green apple-like acidity is a trademark of the wines and can be noticeable in the bouquet.

Like most white Burgundies, Chablis can benefit from some bottle age. While producers' styles and vintage can play an influential role, Grand Cru Chablis can generally age for well over 15 years while many Premier Crus will age well for at least 10 years.|$|E

40|$|<b>Calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> {{represent}} up to {{one third}} of the forest land base in southeastern British Columbia (B. C.). Throughout B. C., <b>calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> occupy about 10 % of the land base. <b>Calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> contain sufficient free lime (calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate) to effervesce when treated with 10 % hydrochloric acid. These soils have high pH, are often finer textured, and occur in B. C. because of semi-arid conditions and/or limestone derived soil parent material. The B. C. Ministry of Forests (B. C. MoF) and Canadian Forest Service (CFS) have studied tree growth on disturbed <b>calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> for over 25 years. Early B. C. MoF studies on harvesting and site preparation disturbance, and CFS studies on skidroad disturbance, created an awareness of the sensitivity of these soils. Soil disturbance guidelines that recognize this sensitivity were developed during the 1980 s and incorporated in the 1995 Forest Practices Code of B. C. Act. Subsequently, an integrated study on <b>calcareous</b> <b>soils</b> has been developed that incorporates existing and new research sites. The largest new installation is a Long-Term Soil Productivity study (LTSP) that includes rehabilitation treatments and “miniplots ” to monitor smaller disturbances, such as displacement and exposure of calcareous subsoils. Mirroring research trials on non-calcareous soils, the objectives of the studies are to test and verify policy aimed at ensuring sustainable forest development. Results to date indicate that trees of some species, such as white spruce (Picea glauca), may grow 30 % less on undisturbed <b>calcareous</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Chardonnay was {{believed}} to be first planted in Chablis by the Cistercians at Pontigny Abbey in the 12th century. Today, the Chardonnay made in the Chablis region is one of the [...] "purest" [...] expression of the varietal character of the grape due to the simplistic style of winemaking favored in this region. Chablis winemakers want to emphasise the terroir of the <b>calcareous</b> <b>soil</b> and cooler climate that help maintain high acidity. The wines rarely go through malolactic fermentation or are exposed to oak (though its use is increasing). The biting, green apple-like acidity is a trademark of Chablis and can be noticeable in the bouquet. The acidity can mellow with age and Chablis are some of the longest-living examples of Chardonnay. Some examples of Chablis can have an earthy [...] "wet stone" [...] flavor that can get mustier as it ages before mellowing into delicate honeyed notes. The use of oak is controversial in the Chablis community, with some winemakers dismissing it as counter to the [...] "Chablis style" [...] or terroir, while others embrace its use, though not to the length that would characterise a [...] "New World" [...] Chardonnay. The winemakers who use oak tend to favor more neutral oak that does not impart the vanilla characteristic associated with American oak. The amount of [...] "" [...] in the barrel is often very light, which limits the amount of [...] "toastiness" [...] perceived in the wine. The advocates of oak in Chablis point to the positive benefits of allowing limited oxygenation with the wine through the permeable oak barrels. This can have the effect of softening the wine and making the generally austere and acidic Chablis more approachable at a younger age.|$|E
