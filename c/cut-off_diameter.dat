40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} the cyclone inlet {{dimensions}} on the performance and flow field pattern has been investigated computationally using the Reynolds stress turbulence model (RSM) for five cyclone separators. The results show that, the maximum tangential velocity in the cyclone decreases with increasing the cyclone inlet dimensions. No acceleration occurs in the cyclone space (the maximum tangential velocity is nearly constant throughout the cyclone). Increasing the cyclone inlet dimensions decreases the pressure drop. The cyclone <b>cut-off</b> <b>diameter</b> increases with increasing cyclone inlet dimension (consequently, the cyclone overall efficiency decreases due to weakness of the vortex strength). The effect of changing the inlet width is more significant than the inlet height especially for the <b>cut-off</b> <b>diameter.</b> The optimum ratio of inlet width to inlet height b/a is from 0. 5 to 0. 7...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper {{we proposed a}} modification of metal-coated tapered-fibre aperture probes for scanning near-field optical microscopes. The modification consists of radial corrugations of the metal-dielectric interface oriented inward the core. Their purpose is to facilitate the excitation of propagating surface plasmons, which increase the transport of energy beyond the <b>cut-off</b> <b>diameter</b> and radiate a quasi-dipolar field from the probe output rim. An increase in energy output allows for reduction of the apex diameter, which is the main factor determining {{the resolution of the}} microscope. In FDTD simulations we analyse the performance of the new type to SNOM probe. We aim at achieving of maximum energy throughput in probes with corrugations that may be realized in a glass etching process. Comment: 17 pages, 12 figure...|$|E

40|$|Commercially {{available}} cascade impactors, {{commonly used}} for aerodynamic size separation of aerosol particles, {{are based on}} the principle of inertial impaction. As of now, these instruments are imported at a cost of several lakhs of rupees; hence an effort has been made to develop an aerodynamic particle sizer indigenously in BARC. This unit, referred to as BARC Aerodynamic Size Separator (BASS), separates aerosols into seven size classes ranging from 0. 53 mu m to 10 mu m and operates at a flow rate of 45 Ipm. Intercomparison studies between the standard Andersen Mark-II (Grasbey Andersen Inc.) impactor and BASS using nebulizer generated aerosols have consistently shown excellent performance by BASS in all respects. In particular, BASS yielded the parameters of polydisperse aerosols quite accurately. Experiments to evaluate the individual stage <b>cut-off</b> <b>diameters</b> show that these are within 8 % of their designed value for all stages except the higher two stages which indicate about 30 % lower values than the designed ones. The replotting of all the mass distribution data using the experimental <b>cut-off</b> <b>diameters</b> showed perfect lognormal fits, thereby indicating that these diameters are closer to the true stage <b>cut-off</b> <b>diameters</b> for BASS. The studies show that BASS will be suitable for determining the particle size distributions {{in the context of the}} radiological safety programmes of DAE. Being indigenous in design, it may be fabricated on a commercial scale at a cost far less than that of the imported units.

40|$|Data {{from three}} forest sites in Sumatra (Batang Ule, Pasirmayang and Tebopandak) have been {{analysed}} and compared {{for the effects}} of sample area <b>cut-off,</b> and tree <b>diameter</b> <b>cut-off.</b> An 'extended inverted exponential model' is shown to be well suited to fitting tree-species-area curves. The model yields species carrying capacities of 680 for Batang Ule, 380 species for Pasirmayang, and 35 for Tebopandak (tree diameter > 10 cm). It would seem that in terms of species carrying capacity, Tebopandak and Pasirmayang are rather similar, and both less diverse than the hilly Batang Ule site. In terms of conservation policy, this would mean that rather more emphasis should be put on conserving hilly sites on a granite substratum. For Pasirmayang with tree diameter > 3 cm, the asymptotic species number estimate is 567, considerably higher than the estimate of 387 species for trees with diameter > 10 cm. It is clear that the <b>diameter</b> <b>cut-off</b> has a major impact on the estimate of the species carrying capacity. A conservative estimate {{of the total number of}} tree species in the Pasirmayang region is 632 species!

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the significance of ulcer size and location in differential diagnosis of GUs at endoscopy. Materials and methods: Data were retrospectively collected from the records of gastrointestinal endoscopy unit and pathology laboratory of our hospital between August 2008 and October 2010. We evaluated the demographic, endoscopic and histopathological features of the patients with GU. ROC curve analysis was performed for determining <b>cut-off</b> <b>diameter</b> differing malign ulcer from benign ulcer during gastroscopy. Results: A total of 161 patients (81 males, 80 females) with gastric ulcer were included. Twenty-seven patients had malign ulcer and 134 had benign ulcer. Mean ages of groups of malign and benign ulcer were 66. 4 ± 13. 8 and 56. 7 ± 17 years, respectively (p< 0. 05). Ulcer locations were angulus and antrum in 48 % of the patients with malign ulcer and in 86 % of with benign ulcer. Mean ulcer diameters were 21. 1 ± 12. 4 mm and 8. 3 ± 6. 2 mm, for malign and benign ulcers respectively (p< 0. 05). <b>Cut-off</b> <b>diameter</b> of gastric ulcers for differing malign from benign was 11 mm. Sensitivity and specifity of this value was 88. 9 % and 88. 8 %, respectively. Conclusions: Although, the site of the ulcer cannot be taken as indicative of its nature, ulcer size may help for predicting ulcer nature. Malignant ulcers tended to be larger (≥ 11 mm). The repetition of endoscopy may be delayed until the end of treatment in small ulcers (< 11 cm). J Clin Exp Invest 2011; 2 (3) : 273 - 276...|$|E
30|$|We {{proposed}} a CPN laser structure based on semiconductor nanowire and metal V-groove {{together with an}} ultrathin layer of dielectric. With the presence of high-index nanowire, channel plasmons can exist in the grooves with relatively large angles forming hybrid channel plasmonic modes. The metal groove modifies the dielectric environment around the nanowire and constructs a subwavelength cavity enabling the enhancement of spontaneous emission rate. Guiding and lasing properties were investigated using finite elements method. The fundamental mode HE 11 x in CPN-N laser has a very small <b>cut-off</b> <b>diameter,</b> enabling ultra-small footprint of on-chip lasers. With the advantage of high confinement and ultra-small normalized modal area, the Purcell factor can reach more than 150 to greatly enhance the spontaneous emission rate.

The different lower <b>cut-off</b> <b>diameters</b> (0. 25 and 0. 3 μm) give an average difference of 23. 5 %.

OPC number size distributions were converted to mass concentrations using instrument-specific factors given by the manufacturer. Mass concentrations for OPC 1. 108 were 60 % higher than for OPC 1. 109 and (in case of OPC 1. 109) much lower than those measured with an impactor in the relevant size range or a TSP filter. Using the C-factor correction suggested by the manufacturer, OPC 1. 109 underestimated mass concentrations by 21 % (impactor) and by about 36 % (TSP filter), {{which is in the}} range of comparability of co-located different mass concentration methods (Hitzenberger, Berner, Maenhaut, Cafmeyer, Schwarz, & Mueller et al., 2004) ...|$|R

Operating two laminar flow DEG-CPCs with different cut-off sizes together with other aerosol instruments, we looked at the growth rates of aerosol population in the CLOUD chamber for particles smaller than 10 nm at different temperatures. A more consistent picture emerged when we normalized the growth rates to a fixed gas-phase sulfuric acid concentration.

We observed that 11 – 16  nm diameter particles were generated at the top region of the boundary layer, and were then rapidly mixed throughout the boundary layer. We also estimate liquid water content of nanoparticles using ground-based measurements of particle hygroscopicity obtained with a Humidified Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer and vertically resolved relative humidity (RH) and temperature measured with a Raman lidar. Our analyses of these observations lead to the following conclusions regarding nanoparticles formed during NPF events at this site: (1)  ground-based observations may not always accurately represent the timing, distribution, and meteorological conditions associated {{with the onset of}} NPF; (2)  nanoparticles are highly hygroscopic and typically contain up to 50  % water by volume, and during conditions of high RH combined with high particle hygroscopicity, particles can be up to 95  % water by volume; (3)  increased liquid water content of nanoparticles at high RH greatly enhances the partitioning of water-soluble species like organic acids into ambient nanoparticles...|$|R

We evaluated {{the role of}} chronic exposure to ambient air pollution on lung function levels in lung transplant recipients (LTRs). The lung function of 520 LTRs from the Cohort in Lung Transplantation (COLT) study was measured every 6 months. The levels of air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), particulate matter with an aerodynamic <b>cut-off</b> <b>diameter</b> of x μm (PMx) and ozone (O 3)) at the patients' home address were averaged in the 12 months before each spirometry test. The effects of air pollutants on forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in % predicted were estimated using mixed linear regressions. We assessed the effect modification of macrolide antibiotics in this relationship. Increased 12 -month levels of pollutants were associated {{with lower levels of}} FVC % pred (- 2. 56 %, 95 % CI - 3. 86 - - 1. 25 for 5 μg·m- 3 of PM 10; - 0. 75 %, 95 % CI - 1. 38 - - 0. 12 for 2 μg·m- 3 of PM 2. 5 and - 2. 58 %, 95 % CI - 4. 63 - - 0. 53 for 10 μg·m- 3 of NO 2). In patients not taking macrolides, the deleterious association between PM and FVC tended to be stronger and PM 10 was associated with lower FEV 1.

40|$|A high-flow (10 L/min) {{nanoparticle}} respiratory deposition (NRD) sampler {{was designed}} and evaluated to facilitate lower limits of quantification (LOQ) for metal nanoparticles than a low-flow (2. 5 L/min) version. The high-flow NRD consists of an inlet, impactor stage, diffusion stage, and a final filter. For the impactor stage, three nozzle sections each containing 12 nozzles were designed from theory to achieve a <b>cut-off</b> <b>diameter</b> (d 50) of 300 nm. Various depths of 37 -mm-diameter foam cylinders were tested for the diffusion stage to obtain a collection efficiency curve similar to the deposition of nanoparticles in the human respiratory tract, the nanoparticulate matter (NPM) criterion. The objective for the final filter was a collection efficiency of near 100 % with minimal pressure drop. The collection efficiencies by size and pressure drop were measured for all components. The impactor stage {{with one of the}} nozzle plates had a d 50 of 305 nm. The collection efficiency for the foam with a depth of 7 cm adjusted for presence of the impactor was the closest match to the NPM curve with a R 2 value of 0. 96. Chemical analysis of the metal content for foam media affirmed that the high-flow NRD would require less sampling time to meet LOQs than the 2. 5 L/min NRD. The final filter with a modified support pad had a collection efficiency near 100 %. The overall pressure drop of the sampler 4. 4 kPa (17. 5 in.

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{repeatedly}} established {{adverse health effects}} due to long-term exposure to ambient air pollution. The Swiss Study on Air Pollution and Lung Disease in Adults (SAPALDIA) published a - 3. 14 % decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) per 10 microg x m(- 3) increment in particulate matter (particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> aerodynamic <b>diameter</b> of 10 microm (PM(10)). Compared to the within-subject variability of FVC, the effect may be considered small. This individual (or clinical) perspective is, however, misleading. The {{purpose of this study}} was to demonstrate the public health relevance of apparently "small" effects, using the impact of PM 10 on FVC as an example. The scenario compares a population A, exposed to an annual mean PM 10 of 20 microg x m(- 3), with a population B exposed to 30 microg x m(- 3) mean PM 10. A shift of - 3. 14 % in the population distribution of FVC increases the number of subjects in the lower tail of the distribution. In population B a relative increase was expected of 47 % (16 - 91 %) in the prevalence of "FVC < 80 % predicted", (i. e., from 5. 17 to 7. 59 % and 5. 88 to 8. 65 % among males and females, respectively). The relative increase in the prevalence of "FVC < 70 % predicted" (approximately 1 % of population) was 63 % (30 - 98 %, males) and 57 % (21 - 86 %, females). An epidemiological estimate of a change in the mean value of the population distribution should not be misinterpreted as an effect on the individual level. However, the impact of a 10 microg x m(- 3) increase in particles with a 50 % <b>cut-off</b> aerodynamic <b>diameter</b> of 10 microm (PM 10) on the number of subjects with a clinically relevant reduction in lung function is quantitatively important...|$|R

No consistent association between daily changes of air pollution levels and daily variations of peak expiratory flows or respiratory symptoms prevalence and incidence was found. In conclusion, no clear effect of air pollution on respiratory health could be observed...|$|R
