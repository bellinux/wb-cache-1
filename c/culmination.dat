40|$|From the Palacozoic to the Cretaceous, crustal {{thinning}} in the Mid Norway {{area was}} associated with the denudation of gneiss-cored <b>culminations</b> and metamorphic core complexes in the footwalls of major extensional faults. The development of the <b>culminations</b> led to warping and deactivation of early detachments, to the nucleation of new faults in more distal positions and to the exhumation of highgrade metamorphic rocks to more shallow levels in the crust. Some of the <b>culminations</b> and core complexes became part of the erosional template in Mid-Late Palaeozoic time, some were probably exhumed in the Mesozoic, whereas some may never have reached the surface. We present an overview of five types of gneiss-cored <b>culminations</b> and core complexes that have been identified in the field, through the interpretation of offshore, long-offset seismic reflection data. We furthermore address their mechanism(s) of formation, and their role in the progressive evolution of the Mid-Norwegian margin...|$|R

40|$|The {{amplitude}} {{and timing}} of past glacier <b>culminations</b> are sensitive recorders of key climate events on a regional scale. Precisely dating young moraines using cosmogenic nuclides to investigate Holocene glacier chronologies has proven challenging, but progress in the high-sensitivity 10 Be technique has recently been shown to enable the precise dating of moraines as young as a few hundred years. In this study we use 10 Be moraine dating to reconstruct <b>culminations</b> of the Steingletscher, a small mountain glacier in the central Swiss Alps, throughout the Holocene. The outermost-recorded positions of Steingletscher most likely occurred in the Early Holocene and appear nearly synchronous with glacier <b>culminations</b> reported from other regions in the Alps. A Late-Holocene position corroborates the evidence for a significant glacier advance of similar extent {{to that of the}} Little Ice Age (LIA) ∼ 3 kyr ago. Finally, fourteen boulders from different moraines yield 10 Be ages between 580 and 140 years with analytical precisions mostly < 10 %, dating Steingletscher advances during the LIA. Because these LIA 10 Be ages are in stratigraphic order, we tentatively distinguish four LIA glacier culminations: about 1470 CE, 1650 CE, 1750 CE and 1820 CE, which are in good agreement with existing independent records during the LIA in the Swiss Alps. These findings illustrate the high potential of the 10 Be moraine dating method to directly link paleo-glacier-chronologies to historical records and thus present-day glacier evolution...|$|R

5|$|The {{arrest and}} {{assassination}} of Ngô Đình Diệm, {{the president of}} South Vietnam, marked the <b>culmination</b> of a successful CIA-backed coup d'état led by General Dương Văn Minh in November 1963. On 2 November 1963, Diệm and his adviser, his younger brother Ngô Đình Nhu, were arrested after the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) had been successful in a bloody overnight siege on Gia Long Palace in Saigon. The coup was the <b>culmination</b> of nine years of autocratic and nepotistic family rule in South Vietnam.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} reconstruction {{of a large}} volcanic structure located offshore the town of Torre del Greco (Naples Bay, Southern Tyrrhenian sea, Italy) and representing the seaward prolongation of the Vesuvius volcano {{has been carried out}} using integrated geological interpretation of existing densely-spaced high-resolution seismic and magnetic profiles. The reconstruction has provided new insights into the knowledge of marine geophysics and volcanology of Vesuvius, one of the most studied volcanoes in the world. Seismic stratigraphy of the volcanic structures shows acoustically-transparent seismic facies and high contrasts of acoustic impedance with respect to the overlying sediments. The structures have mound-shaped external geometry and average dimensions measurable in terms of kilometers. The base of the Torre del Greco volcanic structure overlies the volcanic seismic unit correlated to the "Campanian Ignimbrite" pyroclastic flow deposits. Consequently, no contrast of acoustic impedance between the two volcanic units is clearly evident on the seismic profiles. The top of the structure is irregular and eroded and shows several <b>culminations.</b> The {{three-dimensional reconstruction}} of the Torre del Greco structure has been carried out using seismic constraints and correlations of volcanic structure to bathymetry. The sea floor topography is compared {{to the top of the}} Torre del Greco volcanic structure represented by contour depth of corresponding seismic horizons. Proceeding from south-east to north-west there is a good correspondence between the sea floor topographic surface and the top of the volcanic structure, which does not crop out at the sea bottom. The rising of the volcanic structure in proximity to the sea bottom corresponds to the occurrence of topographic undulations up to ten metres. This evidence is confirmed by the interpretation of seismic profiles, showing three main vertical <b>culminations</b> of the volcanic structure, where the overlying sediment drape is significantly reduced. These <b>culminations</b> are linked to magnetic anomaly extremes, having values ranging between 250 - 350 nT. A striking coincidence between the long-shaped topographic high on the sea floor (towards the east) and the high in the top of the volcanic structure underneath can be explained as a consequence of sea floor deformation due to underlying volcanic <b>culminations.</b> Smaller volcanic mounds, buried and fossilized by marine sediments, are not related to any magnetic anomaly, probably due to their composition of volcanic tuffs...|$|R

5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided {{the foundation for}} the peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and the <b>culmination</b> of the 'Pax Romana'. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E

40|$|Most {{maps and}} {{publications}} {{dealing with the}} geology of the Bodø-Sulitjelma area have postulated {{the presence of a}} major basement culmination; the “Heggmovatn basement dome” between Bodø and Fauske. Granitic gneisses and orthogneisses which dominate the region west of Bodø, have also been considered to be comparable with basement rocks exposed in the Tysfjord and Glomfjord <b>culminations</b> of ~ 1. 8 Ga. Whereas orthogneisses are abundant in the Tysfjord and Glomfjord <b>culminations,</b> the Heggmovatn area is dominated by alternating metapsammites and metapelites which are intruded by both pre- and syn/post-tectonic granitoids. U-Pb ages on zircons from the syn/post-tectonic leucogranites indicate a mid-Silurian (~ 431 Ma) emplacement age whiles Neoproterozoic ages (924 – 928 Ma) are recorded in the orthogneisses in both Bodø and Heggmovatn units indicating Grenvillian/Sveconorwegian magmatic activity which has not been previously recorded in this area. The lithologic differences between the Heggmovatn supracrustals and related intrusives, and the nearby basement <b>culminations,</b> as well as the marked differences in ages indicate that neither the Bodø gneisses nor the Heggmovatn units are Baltic basement rocks. In addition to lithologic similarities between the Heggmovatn metasediments and Krummedal Sequence of the East Greenland Caledonides, the obtained data constrains the period of deposition of the Heggmovatn metasediments to be between 1138 – 928 Ma which is remarkably similar to the 1100 – 930 Ma depositional age of the Krummedal Sequence. The similarities in clastic zircon populations as well as the ages of their associated intrusives suggests very strongly that the Heggmovatn metasediments represent an exotic thrust sheet closely related to the Krummedal Sequence. The obtained data strengthens the interpretation that the Uppermost Allochthon in the Scandinavian Caledonides represents a fragment of Laurentia crust...|$|R
