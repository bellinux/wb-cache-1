40|$|Extraction {{of juice}} from {{shredded}} sugar cane is commonly performed using sets of counter-rotating rolls. Increases in <b>crushing</b> <b>rate</b> through factory mills {{have traditionally been}} achieved by increasing blanket thickness rather than roll surface speed due to concerns regarding loss of extraction efficiency at higher rolling speeds. Recent factory experience has shown that good extraction performance can be achieved at higher speeds than previously thought, provided that adequate drainage of expressed juice away from the rolls is provided. This study uses finite element methods to predict internal energy dissipation levels due to solid matrix deformation and liquid flow during rolling of prepared sugarcane, and to compare milling parameters for thick blanket, low speed rolling versus thin blanket, high speed rolling. The finite element results suggest that higher roll speeds and thinner blankets (than those currently used in industry practice) would maintain <b>crushing</b> <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> juice extraction levels while reducing roll load, torque, and power consumption, and decreasing frictional sliding between rolls and cane blanket. 1 Notation a,b,c coefficients in permeability relatio...|$|R
40|$|Extraction {{of juice}} from {{shredded}} sugarcane is commonly performed using sets of counter-rotating rolls. The design {{and operation of}} sugarcane rolling mills has been largely empirical to date, with limited consideration of the underlying physical processes governing mill performance.

40|$|Escape {{performance}} is fundamental for survival in fish {{and most other}} animals. While previous work has shown that both intrinsic (e. g. size, shape) and extrinsic (e. g. temperature, hypoxia) factors can affect escape performance, the possibility that behavioural asymmetry may affect timing and locomotor performance in startled fish is largely unexplored. Numerous studies have found a relationship between brain lateralization and performance in several cognitive tasks. Here, we tested the hypothesis that behavioural lateralization may affect escape performance in a teleost, the shiner perch Cymatogaster aggregata. Escape responses were elicited by mechanical stimulation and recorded using high-speed video (250 Hz). A number of performance variables were analysed, including directionality, escape latency, turning <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>distance</b> travelled within a fixed time. A lateralization index was obtained by testing the turning preference of each subject in a detour test. While lateralization {{had no effect on}} escape directionality, strongly lateralized fish showed higher escape reactivity, i. e. shorter latencies, which were associated with higher turning <b>rates</b> <b>and</b> longer <b>distances</b> travelled. Therefore, lateralization is likely to result in superior ability to escape from predator attacks, since previous work has shown that escape timing, turning <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> <b>distance</b> travelled are among the main determinants of escape success...|$|R
