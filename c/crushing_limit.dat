40|$|Nine asymmetrically spanned {{reinforced}} concrete deep beams were designed and tested to unreinforced web crushing failure in this experimental study {{to establish the}} appropriate shear stress limit for beam design. The lower bound and mean shear design limits associated with the concrete strut crushing in the web of the beam are identified, based on the better correlated concrete compressive strength parameter rather than its square root. A unified shear stress limit model is proposed to anchor the maximum strut <b>crushing</b> <b>limit</b> and sectional shear stress in design codes via a generic shear enhancement factor. The proposed unified model exhibits modest conservatism compared to the Hong Kong Code of Practice for Structural Concrete 2013 and the Chinese Code for Design of Concrete Structures (GB 50010). Transfer beams, pile caps and corbels, which are typically accompanied by high shear demand, can be optimised in size to leverage construction material cost savings through the more relaxed shear stress limit proposed in this study, which is justified through experiments.

Six {{reinforced}} concrete(RC) {{walls with}} barbell or rectangular cross sections were tested under reversed cyclic loading {{to develop the}} reinforcing method to improve earthquake-resistant performance of low-rise shear walls for which the predominant action is shear.

The method assumes rotational symmetry of the structure. Time integration is by an explicit method. The quasistatic prestressing {{operation of the}} PCRV model is performed by a dynamic relaxation technique. The material model accounts for the crushing and tensile cracking in arbitrary direction in concrete and the elastic-plastic behavior of reinforcing steel. The variation of the concrete tensile cracking and compressive <b>crushing</b> <b>limits</b> with strain rate is taken into account. Relative slip is permitted between the concrete and tendons. Several example solutions are presented and compared with experimental results. These sample problems range from simply supported beams to small scale models of PCRV's.

This thesis documents {{the findings of a}} three year experimental investigation into the impact damage resistance and damage tolerance of composite honeycomb sandwich panels. The primary area of work focuses on the performance of sandwich panels under quasi-static and low-velocity impact loading with hemispherical and flat-ended indenters. The damage resistance is characterised in terms of damage mechanisms and energy absorption. The effects of varying the skin and core materials, skin thickness, core density, panel boundary conditions and indenter shape on the transverse strength and energy absorption of a sandwich panel have been examined. Damage mechanisms are found to include delamination of the impacted skin, core <b>crushing,</b> <b>limited</b> skin-core de bonding and top skin fibre fracture at high loads. In terms of panel construction the skin thickness is found to dominate the panel strength and energy absorption with core density having a lesser influence. Of the external factors considered the indenter noseshape has the largest effect on both failure load and associated damage area. An overview of existing analytical prediction methods is also included and the most significant theories applied and compared with the experimental results from this study. The secondary area of work expands the understanding obtained from the damage resistance study and assesses the ability of a sandwich panel to withstand in-plane compressive loading after sustaining low-velocity impact damage. The importance of the core material is investigated by comparing the compression-after-impact strength of both monolithic carbon-fibre laminates and sandwich panels with either an aluminium or nomex honeycomb core. The in-plane compressive strength of an 8 ply skinned honeycomb sandwich panel is found to be double that of a 16 ply monolithic laminate, with the type of honeycomb also influencing the compressive failure mechanisms and residual compressive strength.

The mechanical attempts were performed under the Copant standards in the  climatized conditions (12 %). To do so, about two thirds of the logs, with a diameter between 20 - 30 cm, were vaporized at 100 o C and 100 % of relative humidity for 20 hours, while  the  remaining  logs  were  kept  as  control.   From  each  log,  a  central plank radially directed with eight centimeter of thickness was taken, from which small beams of 8 cm x 8 cm were taken. Half of the small beams from the vaporized logs were once again submitted to vaporization under the same previously described conditions for a period of 3 hours, thus obtaining three different levels of comparison (control, vaporized on logs and presteaming wood). The results showed a remarkable reduction on the crushing strength in parallel compression to the fiber and shear strength (radial and tangential direction) with the vaporization on the two conditions and sources of Eucalyptus dunnii used.

It {{was found that the}} conductivity of selected silicate powders can be adequately represented, within the experimental errors, by a temperature independent term related to the contact conduction plus a temperature cube term which is due to radiative transfer between and through the grains. The conductivity for glass spheres approximately suggests an inverse grain size dependence and {{does not appear to be}} related in any simple manner to the elastic contact area between the spheres. The effects of angular grains, produced by <b>crushing,</b> and <b>limited</b> chemical composition range are not significant when compared with the experimental errors. The radiative transfer term which is grossly independent of chemical composition and grain texture is dominated by radiation between the grains for grain sizes &# 62; 300 μ.

2500|$|The {{most common}} yeast {{associated}} with winemaking is Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{which has been}} favored due to its predictable and vigorous fermentation capabilities, tolerance of relatively high levels of alcohol and sulfur dioxide {{as well as its}} ability to thrive in normal wine pH between 2.8 and 4. Despite its widespread use which often includes deliberate inoculation from cultured stock, S.cerevisiae is rarely the only yeast species involved in a fermentation. Grapes brought in from harvest are usually teeming with a variety of [...] "wild yeast" [...] from the Kloeckera and Candida genera. These yeasts often begin the fermentation process almost as soon as the grapes are picked when the weight of the clusters in the harvest bins begin to crush the grapes, releasing the sugar-rich must. While additions of sulfur dioxide (often added at the <b>crusher)</b> may <b>limit</b> some of the wild yeast activities, these yeasts will usually die out once the alcohol level reaches about 15% due to the toxicity of alcohol on the yeast cells physiology while the more alcohol tolerant Saccharomyces species take over. In addition to S. cerevisiae, Saccharomyces bayanus is a species of yeast that can tolerate alcohol levels of 17–20% and is often used in fortified wine production such as ports and varieties such as Zinfandel and Syrah harvested at high Brix sugar levels. Another common yeast involved in wine production is Brettanomyces whose presence in a wine may be viewed by different winemakers as either a wine fault or in limited quantities as an added note of complexity.|$|R
40|$|International audienceField {{observations}} of highly porous and permeable sandstone in the Orange area (S-E Basin, France) show that networks of shear-enhanced compaction bands can form in a contractional regime at burial depths of about 400 m ± 100 m. These bands show equal compaction and shear displacements, are organized in conjugate and densely distributed networks, and {{are restricted to}} the coarse-grained (mean grain diameter of 0. 6 ± 0. 1 mm) and less porous (porosity of 26 ± 2 %) sand layers.

They show no control on the alteration products related to meteoric water flow, which suggests that these shear-enhanced compaction bands have no or only negligible influence on subsurface fluid flow. Their selective occurrence and small (20 %) reduction in transmissibility in densely populated layers prevented them from compartmentalizing the sandstone reservoirs.

40|$|IN RECENT TIMES, Australian sugar {{factories}} {{have tried to}} maximise throughput. This trend has continued with factory rationalisation and a need to maximise utilisation of existing capital. The amount of maceration applied to the crushing mills has a great effect on reducing pol loss in final mill bagasse. It is generally recognised that other things being equal, the more maceration the better the extraction. However the down side is that evaporators {{have to be able}} to boil off the extra water. The capacity of the evaporators to boil off that water in turn <b>limits</b> <b>crushing</b> capacity. Other issues associated with higher maceration rates are the evaporators scale quicker and the amount of steam required to maintain crushing capacity increases. Traditional maceration rates have been determined by using a fixed percentage of water at a daily average fibre rate which is at least a 24 hours out of date. Near Infra Red (NIR) measurement was introduced to Mackay sugar mills in 2006 and can be used to determine the quantities of fibre, pol and ash contained in the incoming cane. NIR gives a real time measurement of cane parameters and has allowed fibre rates through the mills to be measured accurately. Those measurements have been combined with cane crushing rates to provide a control value for maceration addition. This accurate control of maceration rate gives the following advantages over the traditional method of controlling maceration flow: mills have a consistent maceration % fibre which means there is always sufficient water to get the required pol recovery regardless of the cane characteristics; mills are not using extra maceration – just the right amount to give the right balance between bagasse loss, evaporator capacity and steam availability; more stable ESJ (Evaporator Supply Juice) brix which produces more stable evaporator performance; consistent final bagasse moisture and quality...|$|R
40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Side impact {{collisions}} represent the second greatest cause of fatality in motor vehicle accidents. Side-impact airbags (SABs), though not mandated by NHTSA, have been installed in recent model year vehicle due to its effectiveness in reducing passengers' injuries and fatality rates. However, the increase in number of frontal and side airbags installed in modern vehicles has concomitantly led {{to the rise of}} airbag related injuries. A typical side-impact mechanical or electronic sensor require much higher sensitivity due to the <b>limited</b> <b>crush</b> zones making SABs deployment more lethal to out-of-position passengers and children. Appropriate pre-crash sensing needs to be utilized in order to properly restraint passengers and reduce passengers' injuries in a vehicle collision. A typical passenger vehicle utilizes sensors to activate airbag deployment when certain crush displacement, velocity and or acceleration threshold are met. In this study, it is assumed that an ideal pre-crash sensing system such as a combination of proximity and velocity and acceleration sensors is used to govern the SAB pre-deployment algorithm. The main focus {{of this paper is to}} provide a numerical analysis of the benefit of pre-deploying SAB in lateral crashes in reducing occupant injuries. The effectiveness of SABs at low and high speed side-impact collisions are examined using numerical Anthropomorphic Test Dummy (ATD) model. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is primarily used to evaluate this concept. Velocities ranging from 33. 5 mph to 50 mph are used in the FEA simulations. The ATD used in this test is the ES- 2 re 50 th percentile side-impact dummy (SID). Crucial injury criteria such as Head Injury Criteria (HIC), Thoracic Trauma Index (TTI), and thorax deflection are computed for the ATD and compared against those from a typical airbag system without pre-crash sensing. It is shown that the pre-deployment of SABs has the potential of reducing airbag parameters such as deployment velocity and rise rate that will directly contribute to reducing airbag related injuries...|$|R
40|$|Injury to {{the adult}} {{mammalian}} {{central nervous system}} (CNS) leads to detrimental consequences due to its poor regenerative capacity. Thyroid hormones (THs), well known for their key function in CNS development and maturation, have recently emerged as molecules that can influence regeneration. Several studies have found exogenous THs to be beneficial for peripheral nervous system regeneration. Conversely in adult CNS, studies {{on the role of}} THs in in vivo regeneration remain scarce. Since the zebrafish optic nerve (ON) is an easily accessible part of CNS and regenerates spontaneously upon trauma, it is widely studied to identify important molecules during CNS regeneration. We therefore investigated the effect of lowering T 3 signaling on the regeneration of the ON following crush in adult zebrafish. In addressing the issue we first showed that the reinnervation of the optic tectum (OT) was accelerated when fish were exposed to iopanoic acid (IOP), a compound lowering T 3 availability, or to the TH receptor ß antagonist- methylsulfonylnitrobenzoate. At 7 dpi there was a clear increase in the biocytin labeled area in the OT following anterograde tracing of the retinal ganglion cell axons as well as an increased immunostaining of Gap 43, a protein expressed in outgrowing axons. Next we showed that the increased reinnervation of OT was attenuated when IOP-treated fish were co-treated with exogenous T 3 confirming that increased OT reinnervation was indeed specifically due to decreased T 3 signaling. In search for the mechanism behind the observed response, we first looked at the retinal ganglion cells in the retina. ON <b>crush</b> induced very <b>limited</b> cell death and proliferation {{at the level of the}} retina in both control and anti-thyroid drug treated groups. While the mRNA expression level of regeneration markers such as gap 43, tuba 1, socs 3 b and snap 25 a changed as expected and klf 9 and bdnf did not change following crush, lowering T 3 signaling did not influence the pattern. We therefore found no obvious effect of TH inhibition at the level of the retina. We did however find a correlation between the accelerated OT reinnervation and a more rapid resolution of the microglia/M&# 934;s in the ON and the OT of IOP-treated fish. Beside the presence of reactive astrocytes in the injured ON of control and IOP-treted groups, preliminary data also revealed thepresence of reactive astrocytes in the OT of IOP-treated fish at an early time point after injury, which is 4 days after injury. Finally, we could also show an increased myelin staining in the OT of the treated group. Nevertheless these findings need further investigation to fully decipher their relevance. Taken together these data indicate that lowering T 3 signaling accelerates retinal ganglion cell axon extension and OT reinnervation following ON crush in adult zebrafish and that an altered inflammatory response may be involved in this process. The next step is trying to further elucidate the underlying molecules and mechanisms and use this knowledge in further research aimed at improving regeneration in the mammalian CNS.
