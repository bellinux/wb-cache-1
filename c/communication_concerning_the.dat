5|$|An {{unofficial}} fan translation patch {{was announced}} in mid-2012. Work on the fan translation took place over the following two years, during which time Square Enix was noncommittal concerning an official Western release. The patch was initially announced for an August 2014 release, but was instead was released on June 9, 2014. According to the translation team leader, the patch was downloaded 100,000 times {{in the first four}} days. It was taken down in July of the same year after Square Enix allegedly threatened unspecified legal action, originally thought to be a cease-and-desist order. Later statements revealed that the patch was released earlier than originally announced due to the lead translator on the project wanting fans to see their achievements, which ended up causing a rift between him {{and the rest of the}} team. Before the release, Square Enix and the translation team had been in friendly <b>communication</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> translation. The formal requests to take the patch down were made in the weeks following its release, shortly before the announcement of Type-0 HD. Work on the patch was eventually resumed and a second version, which included unofficial compatibility with the PlayStation 3 system and further translation bugfixes, was eventually released in 2015.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare two {{clinical}} workstations in one {{hospital with}} respect to technical, organizational, cultural and human factors. One clinical workstation was a GUI to the HIS. The other was an electronic patient record for stroke. METHODS: Data were collected by means of in-depth interviews with end-users of both clinical workstations. The interviews were audio taped and transcribed for analysis. RESULTS: End users assessed both clinical workstations as user friendly. Coordination between health care workers was perceived to be enhanced. However, in both situations poor communication between management, implementers and users resulted in uncertainty and skepticism about future perspectives. Further-more, it appeared that inpatient and outpatient settings needed clinical workstations with different requirements for an optimal fit between work practices and information system. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the domain and content of a workstation, it can support coordination between disciplines. The <b>communication</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>the</b> information technology strategy deserves much attention. Finally, the requirements for inpatient and outpatient workstations diffe...|$|E

With everywhere available connectivity and the broad penetration of social network services, the relationship between drivers on the road may gain more transparency, enabling social information to pass through the steel shell of the cars and giving opportunities to reduce anonymity and strengthen empathy. In this paper, we investigate what sort of social communication drivers consider useful for a highway scenario and which factors influence their willingness to receive or send the information concerned. We utilized the “CoConstructing Stories” method to investigate 30 novel scenarios with 22 participants. We find that driver-to-driver communication relating to Safety and Efficiency is well accepted.

A new parameter estimation technique based on genetic algorithms is developed and tested using different objective functions. The influence of the objective functions on the modelling performance is investigated. The new technique models successfully spectra contaminated with high noise levels. The introduction of regularization in the optimization function rationalizes the effects of outliers usually detected in cure monitoring dielectric spectra. The technique was successfully applied to the analysis of a series of spectra obtained during the cure of an epoxy thermosetting resin...|$|R
