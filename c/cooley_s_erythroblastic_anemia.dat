40|$|Understanding iron {{metabolism}} {{has been}} enhanced by identification of genes for iron deficiency mouse mutants. We char-acterized the genetics and iron metabo-lism of the severe anemia mutant hea (hereditary <b>erythroblastic</b> <b>anemia),</b> which is lethal at 5 to 7 days. The hea mutation results in reduced {{red blood cell}} number, hematocrit, and hemoglobin. The hea mice also have elevated Zn protoporphyrin and serum iron. Blood smears from hea mice are abnormal with elevated numbers of smudge cells. Aspects of the hea anemia can be transferred by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Neonatal hea mice show a similar hematologic phenotype to the flaky skin (fsn) mutant. We mapped the hea gene near the fsn locus on mouse chromosome 17 and show that the mu-tants are allelic. Both tissue iron overload-ing and elevated serum iron are also found in hea and fsn neonates. There is a shift from iron overloading to iron defi-ciency as fsn mice age. The fsn anemia is cured by an iron-supplemented diet, sug-gesting an iron utilization defect. When this diet is removed there is reversion to anemia with concomitant loss of over-loaded iron stores. We speculate that the hea/fsn gene is required for iron uptake into erythropoietic cells and for kidney iron reabsorption. (Blood. 2004; 104...|$|R

40|$|Human {{liver tissue}} has been assayed to {{determine}} the amount of hemoglobin production factors in normal and abnormal states. Standardized dogs made anemic by blood removal have been used in this biological assay. Normal animal liver as control is rated as 100 per cent. Normal human liver tissue as compared with the normal animal control contains more of these hemoglobin production factors—a biological assay ratio of 120 to 160 per cent. Infections, acute and chronic, do not appear to modify these values, the concentration of hemoglobin-producing factors falling within the normal range. Pernicious anemia and aplastic anemia both show large liver stores of hemoglobin-producing factors—a biological assay ratio of 200 to 240 per cent. Therapy in pernicious anemia reduces these liver stores as new red cells are formed. Secondary anemia presents a low normal or subnormal liver store of hemoglobin-producing factors—an assay of 60 to 130 per cent. Hemochromatosis, <b>erythroblastic</b> <b>anemia,</b> and hemolytic icterus in spite of large iron deposits in the liver usually show a biological assay which is normal or close to normal. Polycythemia shows low reserve stores of hemoglobin-producing factors. Leukemias present a wide range of values discussed above. Hypoproteinemia almost always is associated with low reserve stores of hemoglobin-producing factors in the liver—biological assays of 60 to 80 per cent. Hypoproteinemia means a depletion of body protein reserve stores including the labile protein liver reserves—a strong indication that the prehemoglobin material (or globin) is related to these liver stores. Pregnancy, eclampsia, and lactation all may present subnormal liver stores of hemoglobin-producing factors. Exhaustion of protein stores lowers the barrier to infection and renders the liver very susceptible to many toxic substances. It should not be difficult to correct hypoproteinemia under these conditions and thus relieve the patient of a real hazard...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the anti-leukemic {{potential}} of Natural Killer (NK) cells {{and their role}} in hematologic malignancies and in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplants (HSCT) has attracted greater interest and {{a recent study by}} <b>Cooley</b> <b>S.</b> et al. showed a better clinical outcome when patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia received a transplant from unrelated Group B KIR haplotypes donors. As a consequence of these results, an algorithm called "KIR B-content score" was formulated, {{based on the number of}} centromeric and telomeric Group B KIR haplotypes gene-content motifs. The KIR B-content score defines three categories of donors: Neutral donors have none or one KIR B motifs, Better donors have two or more B motifs without KIR Cen B/B and Best donors have two or more B motifs with KIR Cen B/B. The aim of our research is a retrospective analysis of HSC unrelated transplants performed in our center to analyze the effect of the donor KIR B status on the clinical-outcome. Our results showed a better overall survival-rate in the AML recipients, HLA mismatched with the donor, when the donor KIR B content status is Best/Better (37 % vs 18 % at three years P= 0, 028), whereas there is no beneficial effect for recipients with other haematological malignancies. Moreover, we observed that AML recipients, whose Donors KIR B status was Best/Better, had more incidence of aGvHD grade I II than patients whose Donors KIR B status was Neutral (70 % vs 26 %) and also a lower rate of relapse (36 % vs 58 %) and a better Disease Free Survival-rate (58 % vs 38 % at three years P= 0, 1) because of a better GvL effect...|$|R

25|$|In 1923, the {{airfield}} {{was taken over}} by the Cooley family. Charles P. Cooley was the primary flight instructor in San Carlos at the time, after returning from battle. The airport itself was legally operated by <b>Cooley's</b> father, Frank <b>S.</b> <b>Cooley.</b> On July 12, 1940, a fire destroyed the main hangar and twelve aircraft. The family then vacated the property in 1935, closing the airport and the flight school and moving their operations to a new airfield near today's Twin Dolphin Drive in San Carlos. By March 1950, {{the airfield}} had a 200ft by 2100ft runway and a building for various industries on the airfield. However, the Cooley family soon regarded the airport as being inadequate due to its proximity to the Phelpes Slough and Steinberger Slough and poor ground conditions for a suitable runway. They opened another airfield at the present location of the San Carlos airport. By March 1952, the Cooley family transferred ownership of the airfield to Mr. Francis Michaud, who renamed it San Carlos-Belmont Airport. Many repair and administrative buildings were added along with plans to expand the runway up to 7000ft in length. In 1957, the airport was renamed as San Mateo Country Airport, Inc. Ownership was also split between Michaud, the Piombo Construction Company and six other parties.|$|R

40|$|There is {{a misguided}} {{perception}} that RF spectrum space is fully allocated and fully used though even a superficial study of actual spectrum usage by measuring local RF energy shows it largely empty of radiation. Traditional regulation uses a fence-off policy, in which competing uses are isolated by frequency and/or geography. We seek to modernize this strategy. Given advances in radio technology {{that can lead}} to fully cooperative broadcast, relay, and reception designs, we begin by studying the existing radio environment in a qualitative manner. We wish to objectively understand the purpose of a particular transmission, its threshold of allowable interference, and whether anyone is attempting to receive it. We wish to propose ways in which cognitive radio systems might coexist with legacy radio systems. In Chapter 1, we review the conditions that led to the current regulatory climate. Chapter 2 discusses the purpose of this thesis and how the work done relates to cognitive radio technologies. Chapter 3 discuses the design of data capture and analysis modules used to better understand RF spectrum space usage.

40|$|Downtown Boise, Idaho is a vibrant, safe, and {{pedestrian}} friendly city to work, shop, {{live and}} play. However, Boise {{has not always}} enjoyed its current state of well being. For many years downtown Boise was a desolate wasteland. Very few people frequented downtown, and nearly no one resided downtown. From the late 1960 s to the mid 1970 s nearly eight city blocks of Boise's Central Business District were demolished with money from Federal Urban Renewal Grants. Thereafter, the redevelopment of downtown Boise was stopped for 15 years due to the supposedly imminent arrival of a downtown, enclosed, retail mall. Thanks to {{the vision of a}} few politicians and the actions of a couple of agencies Downtown Boise recovered. This thesis analyzes the mistakes and wisdom of Boise's urban renewal efforts as well as the actions of politicians and agencies in making downtown Boise into a successful mixed-use downtown. In particular, this thesis focuses on what went wrong during Boise's first downtown urban renewal attempt and the actions and practices put into place to ensure the same mistakes did not occur during the second renewal period. I will conclude by highlighting the lessons learned through the process of rejuvenating downtown Boise. This thesis is intended to aid cities that find themselves in the desolate situation Downtown Boise found itself 15 years ago. By understanding both the process by which downtown Boise was changed and the lessons learned throughout the first and second urban renewal endeavors, {{it is my hope that}} cities will gain ideas to assist them in the rebuilding and improving of their own downtowns. by Matthew <b>Cooley</b> Smith.
