50|$|Throdkin is a {{traditional}} breakfast food of the Fylde, Lancashire, England. It consists of a dough of oatmeal and water pressed into a pie plate, topped with pieces of fat bacon, and baked. It was <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> tart-style for serving.|$|E
50|$|Although shortbread was {{prepared}} {{during much of}} the 12th century, the refinement of shortbread is credited to Mary, Queen of Scots in the 16th century. This type of shortbread was baked, <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> triangular <b>wedges,</b> and flavored with caraway seeds.|$|R
50|$|In Southeast Asia, the {{cassava root}} is {{commonly}} <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> slices, <b>wedges</b> or strips, fried, {{and served as}} a snack, similar to potato chips, wedges or french fries. Another method is to boil large blocks until soft, and serve them with grated coconut as a dessert, either slightly salted or sweetened, usually with palm sugar syrup. In Thailand, this dish is called mansampalang.|$|R
5000|$|In {{traditional}} Mexican cuisine, the quesadilla sincronizada ( [...] , [...] "synchronized quesadilla") is a tortilla-based sandwich made {{by placing}} ham and sometimes refried beans and chorizo and {{a portion of}} Oaxaca cheese (or any type of cheese) between two corn tortillas. They are then grilled or even lightly fried until the cheese melts and the tortillas become crispy, <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> halves or <b>wedges</b> and served, usually with salsa and pico de gallo, avocado or guacamole on top and/or other toppings or condiments.|$|R
50|$|Bannock is {{a variety}} of flat quick bread or any large, round article baked or cooked from grain. When a round bannock is <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>wedges,</b> the wedges are often called scones. However, in Scotland the words bannock and scone are often used interchangeably.|$|E
50|$|Tortilla chips — {{made from}} maize tortillas <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>wedges,</b> then fried — first gained {{popularity}} in the 1940s in Los Angeles, California and were mass-produced there. Often mistaken as Mexican food, {{they are in fact}} Southwestern food. The ingredients in maize tortillas are maize, lime, and water. Fried chips add salt and vegetable oil.|$|E
50|$|Potatonik may {{refer to}} two {{distinct}} potato-based dishes derived from Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine. One version is a hybrid between potato kugel and bread, containing shredded potatoes and onions {{as well as}} ample flour and leavened with yeast. Another dish, apparently unrelated but called by the same name, is essentially a very large latke meant to be <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> at the table. Also known as Geribinik.|$|E
50|$|The last of {{the most}} common type of cuts is the V-cut. V-cutters look like {{guillotine}} cutters, but <b>cut</b> a <b>wedge</b> <b>into</b> the cigar cap rather than completely removing it, creating a clean-looking gash. Good V-cutters penetrate deeper into the filler than straight cutters, and some smokers prefer them for thicker gauge cigars. However, cheap V-cutters can result in sloppy <b>cuts</b> too deep <b>into</b> the cigar, which result in an uneven burn.|$|R
50|$|The root's {{exterior}} is {{yellow and}} papery, while its inside is creamy white with a crisp texture that resembles raw potato or pear. The flavor is sweet and starchy, reminiscent of some apples or raw green beans, {{and it is}} usually eaten raw, sometimes with salt, lemon, or lime juice, alguashte, and chili powder. It is also cooked in soups and stir-fried dishes.Jícama is often paired with chili powder, cilantro, ginger, lemon, lime, orange, red onion, salsa, sesame oil, grilled fish, and soy sauce. It can be <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> thin <b>wedges</b> and dipped in salsa. In Mexico, it is popular in salads, fresh fruit combinations, fruit bars, soups, and other cooked dishes. In contrast to the root, {{the remainder of the}} jícama plant is very poisonous; the seeds contain the toxin rotenone, which is used to poison insects and fish.|$|R
40|$|The {{inability}} to induce rooting of in vitro-established Protea cynaroides microshoots has prevented {{the production of}} complete plantlets. A successful shoot-tip micrografting technique was developed using in vitro-germinated P. cynaroides seedlings as rootstocks and axenic microshoots established from pot plants as microscions. Thirty-day old seedlings, germinated on growth-regulator-free, half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium, were decapitated and a vertical incision made from the top end. The bottom ends of microshoots established on modified Murashige and Skoog medium were <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> a <b>wedge</b> (‘V’) shape, and placed into the incision. The micrografted explants were cultured in a growth chamber with the temperature adjusted to 25 ± 2 °C, with a 12 -h photoperiod. Best results were obtained by placing the microscions directly onto the rootstock without any pre-treatments. Dipping the explants in anti-oxidant solution or placing a layer of medium around the graft area led to the blackening of the microscion.

5000|$|Sometimes, {{cheese and}} ham are {{sandwiched}} between two flour tortillas, then <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> to serve what is {{commonly known as}} sincronizada (Spanish for [...] "synchronized") in Mexico. Despite appearing almost the same as a quesadilla, it is considered a completely different dish. The sincronizada is frequently confused with the quesadilla by tourists because it is typically called a quesadilla in most Mexican restaurants outside of Mexico.|$|E
50|$|Baghrir or beghrir (البغرير) is {{a pancake}} {{consumed}} in the Maghreb region. They are small, spongy and made with semolina or flour; when cooked correctly, they are riddled with tiny holes (which soak up whatever sauce they are served with). The most common way to eat baghrir in Algeria and Morocco is by dipping them in a honey-butter mixture, {{but they can also}} be <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> and served with jam. It is common to add raisins to the pancake as well. Baghrir are popular for breakfast, as a snack and for iftar during Ramadan.|$|E
5000|$|A tortilla chip ( [...] , [...] ) is a snack food {{made from}} corn tortillas, which are <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> and then fried—or baked (alternatively {{they may be}} discs pressed out of corn masa then fried or baked). Corn tortillas are made of corn, {{vegetable}} oil, salt and water. Although first mass-produced in Los Angeles in the late 1940s, tortilla chips were always {{considered to be a}} Mexican food, known as totopos and tostadas. Though usually made of yellow corn, they can also be made of white, blue, or red corn. Some manufacturers include many other ingredients including wheat, sugar, and monosodium glutamate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{more modern}} (and popular) {{approach}} is to bake thicker bammies about 6" [...] in diameter. These are often mass-produced in factories. When home-baked, the flour may be store-bought or made by hand-pressing. The bammy can be baked on griddles or in baking pans on a stove top. Some choose to bake it inside an oven, and to add butter and other spices before baking. Baking takes longer due to the thickness, and the final product is then <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> halves or <b>wedges</b> for freezing. When ready to eat, the wedges are soaked in coconut milk and then fried to a golden brown, and served with meat, fish, avocado, or other side dishes.|$|R

50|$|There {{is also a}} {{style of}} thin-crust pizza found in Chicago and {{throughout}} the rest of the Midwest. The crust is thin and firm enough to have a noticeable crunch, unlike a New York-style pizza. This pizza is cut into squares, also known as a party cut or tavern cut, as opposed to a pie <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>wedges.</b> Among locals, thin-crust actually outsells the more widely known deep-dish style. Aurelio's Pizza is a chain which specializes in this kind of pizza. Casa Bianca, located in the Eagle Rock section of Los Angeles, is also well known for this style of thin-crusted Chicago bar pizza.|$|E
50|$|Caerphilly cheese was {{originally}} a moist curd, made in local farms. It {{has since been}} replaced with a much drier version produced on an industrial scale. However, there still remain some cheesemakers producing Caerphilly in the old style on an artisan basis. The cheese {{was originally}} made to feed the coal miners of the area. It has subsequently been suggested that the salt content of the cheese was required by manual workers, {{and it can be}} <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> and does not dry out in the conditions underground. Caerphilly became a centre for cheese production, but over time competing demands for the milk required resulted in production of the cheese moving to England {{at the start of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{preparation}} involves {{cheese and}} other ingredients sandwiched between two flour tortillas, {{with the whole}} package grilled on an oiled griddle and flipped so both sides are cooked and the cheese is melted. This version is often <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> to serve. A home appliance (quesadilla maker) is sold to produce this kind of quesadilla, although it does not use oil and cooks both sides at once. This type {{is similar to the}} Mexican sincronizada; but in the United States, they often also have fajita beef or chicken or other ingredients instead of ham. That kind of quesadilla is also Mexican, and it is called [...] "gringa" [...] (the name varies in some regions in Mexico, there's also a type of quesadilla called [...] "chavindeca").|$|E
50|$|Lucanian Caciocavallo Podolico {{deserves to}} be tasted on its own {{especially}} if it has undergone a lengthy seasoning. Before serving it is <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> round slices and then <b>into</b> triangular <b>wedges.</b> Sweet caciocavallo, with a short seasoning, should {{be accompanied by a}} regional white wine. Seasoned Caciocavallo {{deserves to be}} accompanied by full-bodied red wines, above all Aglianico del Vulture. Finally, if the cheese has been left to mature for more than 24 months, the unusual accompaniment of passito wines, like Moscato di Pantelleria, is advisable. It should also be tasted with the various types of Lucanian honey.|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyFood Science - Animal Sciences & IndustryKelly J. K. GettyProduce such as tomatoes, lettuce, and cantaloupes {{have been}} {{associated}} repeatedly with food outbreaks connected to various Salmonella serovars, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7. The aim {{of this research was}} to validate washing solutions and techniques in reducing pathogens on produce surfaces. Lettuce (25 ± 0. 3 g) and tomatoes were inoculated with E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella spp., respectively. Samples were treated with tap water (TW) or a chemical wash treatment (CWT; containing citric acid) for 30, 60, or 120 s. Reduction of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella spp. populations on the surface of leaf lettuce and tomatoes, respectively, were greater (P< 0. 05) for CWT (ca. 3. 0 logs) than for TW (ca. 2. 3 - 2. 5 logs). Cantaloupes were washed with TW, 9 % vinegar solution, or a commercial antimicrobial for fruit and vegetables treatment (CAFVT; containing lactic acid) for 2 min using a washing system. Cantaloupes were <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> <b>wedges</b> or cubes and stored at 4 ºC for aerobic plate counts (APC) on days 0, 1, 3, and 6. APC populations of cubed and wedged cantaloupes were different over time (P= 0. 00052); cantaloupes washed with 9 % vinegar solution showed the lowest APC populations after day 1 and 3 of storage. Salmonella spp. or L. monocytogenes inoculated cantaloupes were washed with CPW for 30, 60 or 120 s. Washing cantaloupes for 120 s with CPW showed greater (P< 0. 05) reductions of Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes populations (1. 26 and 1. 12 log₁₀ CFU/cm²) than TW (ca. 0. 63 log₁₀ CFU/cm²) on cantaloupe surface. Lettuce leaves were inoculated with rifampicin-resistant E. coli surrogates and then washed with CAFVT, 5 % vinegar solution or TW for 2 min with agitation (washing system) or without. Log reductions of CAFVT (2. 25 log₁₀ CFU/g) were greater (P= 0. 0145) than those by tap water (1. 34 log₁₀ CFU/g), but similar to 5 % vinegar solution (2. 09 log₁₀ CFU/g). Washing lettuce with continuous agitation achieved higher (P= 0. 0072) E. coli reductions (2. 26 log₁₀ CFU/g) than without agitation (1. 53 log₁₀ CFU/g). Overall, incorporation of wash solutions or agitation (washing system) in the washing process compared to TW alone reduced greater (P< 0. 05) APC, pathogens, or surrogates populations from lettuce, tomato, and cantaloupe surfaces...|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a generalized cake-cutting problem {{in which we}} seek to divide multiple cakes so that two players may get their most-preferred piece selections: a choice of one piece from each cake, allowing {{for the possibility of}} linked preferences over the cakes. For two players, we show that disjoint envy-free piece selections may not exist for two cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> two pieces each, and they may not exist for three cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> three pieces each. However, there do exist such divisions for two cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> three pieces each, and for three cakes <b>cut</b> <b>into</b> four pieces each.
