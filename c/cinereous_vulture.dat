25|$|Bulgaria's {{vertebrate}} fauna {{is among}} the most diverse in Europe. The zoogeograhical regions are three: the Eurosiberian region, encompassing the Danubian Plain and the mountainous regions of the country; the Irano-Turanian region encompassing Southern Dobrudzha; and the Mediterranean region that includes the Upper Thracian Plain, the lower Struma valley and the Black Sea coast. Bulgaria is inhabited by around 100 mammal species, including brown bears, grey wolves, Eurasian lynxes, golden jackals, red deer and roe deer among other. The avian fauna is represented by 426 species of birds, which is the second highest number in Europe. Important conservation species are the eastern imperial eagle, the <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture,</b> the great white pelican, the Dalmatian pelican, etc. The reptiles and the amphibians found in Bulgaria are 38 and 20 species respectively. The ichtyofauna of the country has not been fully researched. As of 2000 there are 207 fish species. There are an estimated 27,000 species of insects and other invertebrates.|$|E

50|$|The {{lappet-faced vulture}} {{is a huge}} species, ranking as the longest and largest winged vulture in its range behind the closely related <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture,</b> {{although}} some co-occurring Gyps vultures tend to be heavier on average, especially the Cape vulture and Eurasian griffon. This species measures around 95 - 115 cm in body length, with a wingspan of 2.5 - 2.9 m. Among the standard measurements, the wing chord is 71.5 - 82.5 cm, the tail is 33 - 36 cm and the tarsus is 12.2 - 15 cm. The bill, at up to 10 cm long and 5 cm deep, {{ranks as one of}} the largest of any accipitrid, although a reported culmen length of 7.2 cm is slightly less than the culmen length of the <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture.</b> Wild vultures, of the subspecies T. t. tracheliotus, range from 4.4 to 9.4 kg and, in East Africa, average only 6.2 kg. On the other hand, captive vultures of the larger T. t. negevensis subspecies, weighed 6.5 - 9.2 kg in males and 10.5 - 13.6 kg in females.|$|E
50|$|Like all vultures, the <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture</b> eats mostly carrion. The <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture</b> {{feeds on}} carrion {{of almost any}} type, from the largest mammals {{available}} to fish and reptiles. In Tibet, commonly eaten carcasses can include both wild and domestic yaks (Bos grunniens), Bharal, Tibetan gazelles (Pseudois nayaur), kiangs (Equus kiang), woolly hares (Lepus oiostolus), Himalayan marmots (Marmota himalayana), domestic sheep (Ovis aries), and even humans, mainly those at their celestial burial grounds. Reportedly in Mongolia, Tarbagan marmots (Marmota sibirica) comprised the largest part of the diet, although that species is now endangered as it is preferred in the diet of local people, wild prey ranging from corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) to Argali (Ovis ammon) may be eaten additionally in Mongolia. Historically, cinereous vultures in the Iberian Peninsula fed mostly on European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) carcasses, but since viral hemorrhagic pneumonia (VHP) devastated the once abundant rabbit population there, the vultures now rely on the carrion of domestic sheep, supplemented by pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and deer. In Turkey, the dietary preferences were argali (Ovis ammon) (92 carrion items), wild boar (Sus scrofa) (53 items), chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus) (27 items), gray wolf (13 items) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) (13 items). Unusually, {{a large amount of}} plant material was found in pellets from Turkey, especially pine cones. Among the vultures in its range, the cinereous is best equipped to tear open tough carcass skins thanks to its powerful bill. It can even break apart bones, such as ribs, to access the flesh of large animals. It is dominant over other scavengers in its range, even over other large vultures such as Gyps vultures, bearded vulture or fierce ground predators such as foxes. While noisy Gyps vultures squawk and fly around, the often silent cinereous will keep them well at bay until they are satisfied and have had their own fill. A series of photos taken recently show a <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture</b> attacking a Himalayan griffon in flight for unknown reasons, although the griffon was not seriously injured. Cinereous vultures frequently bully and dominate steppe eagles (Aquila nipalensis) when the two species are attracted to the same prey and carrion while wintering in Asia. A rare successful act of kleptoparasitism on a <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture</b> was filmed in Korea when a Steller's sea eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicus) stole from a vulture.|$|E
40|$|Antibiotic {{residues}} {{that may}} be present in carcasses of medicated livestock could pass to and greatly reduce scavenger wildlife populations. We surveyed residues of the quinolones enrofloxacin and its metabolite ciprofloxacin and other antibiotics (amoxicillin and oxytetracycline) in nestling griffon Gyps fulvus, cinereous Aegypius monachus and Egyptian Neophron percnopterus vultures in central Spain. We found high concentrations of antibiotics in the plasma of many nestling cinereous (57 %) and Egyptian (40 %) vultures. Enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were also found in liver samples of all dead <b>cinereous</b> <b>vultures.</b> This is the first report of antibiotic residues in wildlife. We also provide evidence of a direct association between antibiotic residues, primarily quinolones, and severe disease due to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Our results indicate that, by damaging the liver and kidney and through the acquisition and proliferation of pathogens associated with the depletion of lymphoid organs, continuous exposure to antibiotics could increase mortality rates, at least in <b>cinereous</b> <b>vultures.</b> If antibiotics ingested with livestock carrion are clearly implicated in {{the decline of the}} vultures in central Spain then it should be considered a primary concern for conservation of their populations...|$|R

50|$|Water from {{mountain}} streams {{makes the}} area an important habitat for wildlife {{such as a}} numbered of threatened antelope species such as addax (Addax nasomaculatus), Dama gazelle (Gazella dama), Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas) and Red-fronted gazelle (Gazella rufifrons). Endemic species include the Arid Thicket Rat (Grammomys aridulus) from Jebel Marra. The mountains are home to birds of both Eurasia and Africa, species include Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba) and <b>Cinereous</b> <b>Vulture</b> (Aegypius monachus).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture</b> is {{distinctly}} dark, {{with the}} whole body being brown excepting the pale head in adults, which is covered in fine blackish down. This down is absent in the closely related lappet-faced vulture (Torgos tracheliotos). The skin {{of the head and}} neck is bluish-gray and a paler whitish color above the eye. The adult has brown eyes, a purplish cere, a blue-gray bill and pale blue-gray legs. The primary quills are often actually black. From a distance, flying birds can easily appear all black. The immature plumage is sepia-brown above, with a much paler underside than in adults. Immature cinereous vultures have grey down on the head, a pale mauve cere and grey legs. The massive bill is the largest of any living accipiterid, a feature enhanced by the relatively small skull of the species. The exposed culmen of the <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture</b> measures 8 - 9 cm. The wings, with serrated leading edges, are held straight or slightly arched in flight and are broad, sometimes referred to as [...] "barn door wings". Their flight is slow and buoyant, with deep, heavy flaps when necessary. The combination of huge size and dark coloration renders the <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture</b> relatively distinct, especially against smaller raptors such as eagles or hawks. The most similar-shaped species, the lappet-faced vulture (with which there might be limited range overlap in the southern Middle East), is distinguished by its bare, pinkish head and contrasting plumage. On the lappet-face, the thighs and belly are whitish in adult birds against black to brownish over the remainder of the plumage. All potential Gyps vultures are distinguished by having paler, often streaky plumage, with bulging wing primaries giving them a less evenly broad-winged form. Cinereous vultures are generally very silent, with a few querulous mewing, roaring or guttural cries solely between adults and their offspring at the nest site.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture</b> (Aegypius monachus) {{is a large}} {{raptorial}} {{bird that}} is distributed through much of Eurasia. It {{is also known as}} the black vulture, monk vulture, or Eurasian black vulture. It {{is a member of the}} family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, buzzards and harriers. It is one of the two largest Old World vultures, attaining a maximum size of 14 kg, 1.2 m long and 3.1 m across the wings.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{vegetation}} on the cliffs is sparse, it merits special interest as a habitat for endemic plant {{species such as}} the perennial herb Hippocrepis balearica, and Dianthus alpinus, whose Spanish-language names variously designate it as the [...] "cliff carnation", [...] "forest carnation" [...] or [...] "Mediterranean carnation". The cliff also provides a habitat for birds, especially raptors such as Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae) and osprey (Pandion haliaetus) {{as well as the}} world's only remaining insular <b>cinereous</b> <b>vultures</b> (black vulture, Aegypius monachus). Also worthy of mention, if only for gastronomical reasons, are two species of snail, Helix aspersa and Helix pomatia.|$|R

50|$|The {{climate is}} less humid {{than in the}} Sierra de Aracena further west. Holm oaks are more common, growing in {{clarified}} forests where there are also large clearings, known locally as dehesas. These are characteristic of the Sierra Morena landscape and are traditional pasture zones for cattle and pigs.Also typical are the gallery forests shading the rivers of the range that provide a home to birds such as the Spanish imperial eagle, the <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture</b> and the black stork.|$|E
5000|$|The colour name cinereous is used {{especially}} {{in the names of}} birds with ash grey plumage with a slight coppery brown tinge, including the cinereous antshrike (Thamnomanes caesius), cinereous becard (Pachyramphus rufus), cinereous bunting (Emberiza cineracea), cinereous conebill (Conirostrum cinereum), cinereous finch (Piezorhina cinerea), cinereous ground-tyrant (Muscisaxicola cinereus), cinereous harrier (Circus cinereus), cinereous mourner (Laniocera hypopyrra), cinereous-breasted spinetail (Synallaxis hypospodia), cinereous tinamou (Crypturellus cinereus), cinereous tyrant (Knipolegus striaticeps), <b>cinereous</b> <b>vulture</b> (Aegypius monachus), and cinereous warbling-finch (Poospiza cinerea).|$|E
50|$|The Sierra de San Pedro is an {{important}} ecological area.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} juvenile survival {{are poorly}} {{known in the}} world 2 Ì 7 s most northern antelope, the endangered saiga (Saiga tatarica), yet these factors are fundamental for understanding what drives population change. We monitored Mongolia saiga (S. tatarica mongolica) calves in Sharga Nature Reserve, western Mongolia, during 2008 - 2010. Our results showed that male and single calves were heavier than females and twins, respectively. However, we identified {{no significant differences in}} seasonal or annual survival rates between sexes or between singletons and twins. Litter size and birth mass varied among years, and there was a negative relationship between these variables. Survival of calves during the 1 st year was best explained by the covariates of year and litter size (confounded with body mass), suggesting that interannual variation in environmental conditions influenced twinning rates and body mass, and might {{play a key role in}} 1 st-year survival. We identified 3 sources of mortality predation by raptors, foxes (red fox [Vulpes vulpes] and corsac fox [V. corsac]), and lynx (Lynx lynx). Most predation was attributed to raptors, such as golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) and <b>cinereous</b> <b>vultures</b> (Aegypius monachus). Our results point to both environmental and biotic factors affecting survival of juvenile saiga...|$|R
50|$|Although {{they are}} locally {{sympatric}} with Siberian ibex, {{the two species}} have differing habitat and pasture preferences, reducing likely competition. In Tibet, the argali must regularly compete with other grazing species for pasture, including Tibetan antelope, bharal, Thorold's deer and wild yaks. Competition is most serious with livestock, especially domestic yak and domestic sheep, with which argali are frequently forced to intermingle and from which they often catch diseases and parasites. The main predator of argali are gray wolves, which often exploit harsh winter conditions (such as deep snow) to capture the wild sheep, though they can and do take specimens of any age or condition year around. Where not locally extirpated, snow leopards and leopards are also predators of argali of any age. Eurasian lynx and wolverines may seldom kill argali to at least the size of winter-weakened ewes. Red foxes and domestic dogs (largely those kept by sheep-herders) will prey on lambs. <b>Cinereous</b> <b>vultures,</b> lammergeiers and golden eagles have been observed circling herds of ewes with lambs in a possibly predatory manner and remains of argali lambs have been observed in golden eagle nests. Smaller predators, such as raptorial birds and smaller mammalian carnivores, are attacked by mother ewes, but {{in the presence of}} larger predators, the ewes quickly run away with the lambs following them.|$|R
50|$|The Himalayan vulture perches on crags, {{favourite}} sites showing white {{marks from}} regular defecation. They tend to not range below {{an elevation of}} 1215 m. Himalayan vultures often bask in the sun on rocks. They soar in thermals and are not capable of sustained flapping flight. Flocks may follow grazers up the mountains {{in their search for}} dead animals. This vulture makes a rattling sound when descending on a carcass and can grunt or hiss at roosts or when feeding on carrion. They have been recorded eating carrion exclusively, some which is fed on even when putrid. On the Tibetan Plateau 64% of their diet is obtained from dead domestic yak (Bos grunniens). They feed on old carcasses sometimes waiting a couple of days near a dead animal. They disdain offal, which is readily eaten by other vultures, and instead typically eat only fleshy parts. Historically, Himalayan vultures regularly fed on human corpses left out on Celestial burial grounds. This species is fairly contentious around other scavengers and typically dominates other meat-eaters at carrion, though is subservient to Gray Wolves (Canis lupus), snow leopards (Panthera uncia) and <b>cinereous</b> <b>vultures</b> at carcasses. In a large party, these vultures can reportedly strip a human or sheep carcass of all meat in 30 minutes and do the same to a yak carcass in roughly 120 minutes. Himalayan vultures have been observed feeding on pine (Pinus roxburghii) needles, an unexplained behaviour that cannot be for obtaining nutrition.|$|R
