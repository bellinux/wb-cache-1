5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (goat willow) and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (<b>common</b> <b>alder),</b> Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (downy birch)) and Ericaceae.|$|E
25|$|The {{woodland}} predominantly {{dates from}} the past 40 years, {{although there are some}} mature oaks and other trees. The main species are <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus glutinosa), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), silver birch (Betula pendula) and willow (Salix), with common bramble (Rubus fruticosus) predominant in the undergrowth.|$|E
500|$|Trees held an {{important}} place in Gaelic culture {{from the earliest}} times. Particularly large trees were venerated, and the most valuable such as oak, Common Hazel and Apple were classed as [...] "nobles". The less important <b>Common</b> <b>Alder,</b> Common Hawthorn and [...] Gean were classed as [...] "commoners", and there were [...] "lower orders" [...] and [...] "slaves" [...] such as Eurasian Aspen and Juniper. The alphabet was learned as a mnemonic using tree names. Rowan was regularly planted close to Highland houses as a protection from witchcraft.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{some other}} species of tree, <b>common</b> <b>alders</b> do not produce shade leaves. The {{respiration}} rate of shaded foliage {{is the same as}} well-lit leaves but the rate of assimilation is lower. This means that as a tree in woodland grows taller, the lower branches die and soon decay, leaving a small crown and unbranched trunk.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>common</b> name <b>alder</b> {{evolved from}} Old English alor, {{which in turn}} is derived from Proto-Germanic root aliso. The generic name Alnus is the {{equivalent}} Latin name. Both the Latin and the Germanic words derive from the Proto-Indo-European root el-, meaning [...] "red" [...] or [...] "brown", which is also a root for the English words elk and another tree: elm, a tree distantly related to the alders.|$|R

50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> is most {{noted for}} its {{symbiotic}} relationship with the bacterium Frankia alni, which forms nodules on the tree's roots. This bacterium absorbs nitrogen from the air and fixes it in a form available to the tree. In return, the bacterium receives carbon products produced by the tree through photosynthesis. This relationship, which improves the fertility of the soil, has established the <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> as an important pioneer species in ecological succession.|$|E
50|$|Fothergilla gardenii, {{also known}} by the <b>common</b> names Witch <b>Alder,</b> dwarf fothergilla, American wych hazel, and dwarf witchalder is a {{deciduous}} shrub in the Hamamelidaceae family. It {{is one of two}} species in the genus Fothergilla.|$|R
5000|$|The genus name Frangula, from Latin [...] "to break", {{refers to}} the brittle wood. Both the <b>common</b> name <b>alder</b> {{buckthorn}} and species name alnus refer to its association with alders (Alnus) on damp sites. Unlike other [...] "buckthorns", alder buckthorn does not have thorns. Other recorded names include glossy buckthorn and breaking buckthorn; historically, it was sometimes called [...] "dogwood" [...] through confusion of the leaves with those of Dogwood Cornus sanguinea.|$|R
50|$|Dominant {{tree species}} are oak (Quercus petraea) and {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betulus) {{while on the}} creek banks <b>common</b> ash and <b>alder</b> are found.

50|$|The {{leaves of}} the <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> are short-stalked, rounded, up to 10 cm long with a {{slightly}} wedge-shaped base and a wavy, serrated margin. They have a glossy dark green upper surface and paler green underside with rusty-brown hairs in the angles of the veins. As with some other trees growing near water, the <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> keeps its leaves longer than do trees in drier situations, and the leaves remain green late into the autumn. As the Latin name glutinosa implies, the buds and young leaves are sticky with a resinous gum.|$|E

50|$|Smoked salt is an {{aromatic}} salt smoked with {{any number of}} select bark free woods for up to 14 days. The kind of wood used for smoking impacts the flavor, which can range from subtle to bold or even sweet. The most <b>common</b> choices are <b>alder</b> wood, apple wood, hickory, mesquite, and oak. Infused smoked salts like smoked bacon chipotle sea salt are very popular because of the dynamic flavor profiles.|$|R
40|$|In Italy some {{agricultural}} {{areas have been}} planted with high value hardwood mixed plantations (mainly walnut or cherry trees) realized with a technique that provides benefits also {{for the presence of}} accessory species. The purpose of this work is to study intermediate cutting operations in mixed plantations. Two different plantations of walnut (with poplar and other fitting trees), situated in Lombardia region (Northern Italy), were investigated. In Casal Buttano plantation walnut has a planting distance of 10 x 14 m and it is combined with poplar (5 x 14 m distance). Between the two species there are two shrub rows (cob hazel and elder) and a <b>common</b> European <b>alder</b> row. In walnut rows, the main species is alternated with Eleagnus umbellata shrubs. In San Matteo delle Chiaviche plantation the planting distance between trees is 3 x 3. 5 m. Trees species are walnut, poplar, <b>common</b> European <b>alder</b> and a shrub (Eleagnus umbellata). During intermediate cutting operation poplar needs to be felled providing no damages to standing walnuts. Because of the different distance between species in the two stands, different logging methods were needed. Time studies were carried out to analyse two different logging methods. In Casal Buttano plantation cob hazel shrubs were cut with a cutting-chipper machine that provided biomass for heating. During poplar logging an operator with chainsaw felled the trees assisted by an excavator equipped with a loading grapple; the trees were then forwarded on a tractor bunk. In San Matteo delle Chiaviche plantation a chainsaw operator felled poplar in the right direction supported by an operator with felling lever; the trees were skidded by tractors. Productivity and costs of the two methods were calculated. Both adopted logging methods did not cause any damage to the standing walnuts. First method might be suitable when rows of poplar and walnuts are separated by an accessory species row, in order to avoid damages caused by the excavator. Second method is advisable in stands where rows of poplar and walnuts are adjacent, without any accessory species in the middle...|$|R
50|$|The {{floodplain}} is {{habitat for}} more than 150 tree species. It is surrounded by forests of mainly common ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Widespread trees in the forest area are <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus glutinosa), willow (Salix), common beech (Fagus sylvatica) and elm.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> {{provides}} {{food and}} shelter to wildlife, {{with a number of}} insects, lichens and fungi being completely dependent on the tree. It is a pioneer species, colonising vacant land and forming mixed forests as other trees appear in its wake. Eventually <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> dies out of woodlands because the seedlings need more light than is available on the forest floor. Its more usual habitat is forest edges, swamps and riverside corridors. The timber has been used in underwater foundations and for manufacture into paper and fibreboard, for smoking foods, for joinery, turnery and carving. Products of the tree have been used in ethnobotany, providing folk remedies for various ailments, and research has shown that extracts of the seeds are active against pathogenic bacteria.|$|E
50|$|The {{woodland}} predominantly {{dates from}} the past 40 years, {{although there are some}} mature oaks and other trees.

50|$|The lake {{banks are}} low and are flooded with raising water level. They are {{therefore}} swampy and {{are rich in}} reed, hosting ducks, geese and swans. The coastal region is covered with dense virgin forests. Major tree types are coniferous, but also common are lime (linden), elm and European <b>Alder.</b> <b>Common</b> mammals include elk, brown bear, wolf, fox, hare, squirrel, lynx, pine marten, European badger, as well as American muskrat and mink which {{were introduced to the}} area in the early 20th century. About 200 bird species from 15 families have been observed in the lake basin.|$|R
25|$|The {{climate in}} the area is humid {{continental}} climate, characterized by temperate to hot summers and cold, occasionally severe winters with regular precipitation. The vegetation is dominated by a mixture of coniferous and deciduous forests and treeless coastal meadows and cliffs. The major forest trees are pine, spruce, birch, willows, rowan, aspen, <b>common</b> and gray <b>alder.</b> In the far {{eastern part of the}} gulf vegetation of the marshy areas consists mainly of bulrush and reeds, as well as fully aquatic plants, such as white and yellow waterlilies and acute sedge. Aquatic plants in the shallow waters of the gulf include Ruppia and spiny naiad.|$|R
6000|$|In {{these regions}} {{many of my}} goats and kids had died foaming at the mouth and {{grinding}} their teeth; and I here discovered the cause to arise from their eating the leaves of Rhododendron cinnabarinum* [The poisonous honey produced by other species is alluded to at vol. i., chapter ix. An Andromeda and a Gualtheria, I have been assured are equally deleterious.] ("Kema Kechoong," [...] Lepcha: Kema signifying Rhododendron): this species alone {{is said to be}} poisonous; and when used as fuel, it causes the face to swell and the eyes to inflame; of which I observed several instances. As the subject of fire-wood is of every-day interest to the traveller in these regions, I may here mention that the rhododendron woods afford poor fires; juniper burns the brightest, and with least smoke. Abies Webbiana, though emitting much smoke, gives a cheerful fire, far superior to larch,* [The larch of northern Asia (Larix Europoea) is said to produce a pungent smoke, which I never observed to be the case with the Sikkim species.] spruce, or Abies Brunoniana. At Dorjiling, oak is the <b>common</b> fuel; <b>alder</b> is also good. Chestnut is invariably used for blacksmith's charcoal. Magnolia has a disagreeable odour, and laurel burns very badly.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> is {{important}} to wildlife all year round and the seeds are a useful winter food for birds. Deer, sheep, hares and rabbits feed on the tree and it provides shelter for livestock in winter. It shades the water of rivers and streams, moderating the water temperature, and this benefits fish which also find safety among its exposed roots in times of flood. The <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> is the foodplant of the larvae {{of a number of}} different butterflies and moths and is associated with over 140 species of plant-eating insect. The tree is also a host to a variety of mosses and lichens which particularly flourish in the humid moist environment of streamside trees. Some common lichens found growing on the trunk and branches include tree lungwort (Lobaria pulmonaria), Menneguzzia terebrata and Stenocybe pullatula, the last of which is restricted to alders. Some 47 species of mycorrhizal fungi have been found growing in symbiosis with the <b>common</b> <b>alder,</b> both partners benefiting from an exchange of nutrients. As well as several species of Naucoria, these symbionts include Russula alnetorum, the milkcaps Lactarius obscuratus and Lactarius cyathula, and the alder roll-rim Paxillus filamentosus, all of which grow nowhere else except in association with alders. In spring, the catkin cup Ciboria amentacea grows on fallen alder catkins.|$|E
50|$|The bark of the <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> {{has long}} been used in tanning and dyeing. The bark and twigs contain 16 to 20% tannic acid but their {{usefulness}} in tanning {{is limited by the}} strong accompanying colour they produce. Depending on the mordant and the methods used, various shades of brown, fawn, and yellowish-orange hues can be imparted to wool, cotton and silk. Alder bark can also used with iron sulphate to create a black dye which can substitute for the use of sumach or galls. The Laplanders are said to chew the bark and use their saliva to dye leather. The shoots of the <b>common</b> <b>alder</b> produce a yellowish or cinnamon-coloured dye if cut early in the year. Other parts of the tree are also used in dyeing; the catkins can yield a green colour and the fresh-cut wood a pinkish-fawn colour.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife in {{the nature}} reserve {{includes}} kingfisher, mute swans, watervoles, damselfly and dragonfly species such as the white-faced darter, various species of duck, and even the rare bird of prey the hobby.
