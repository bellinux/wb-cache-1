40|$|<b>Caking</b> <b>of</b> food powders {{is highly}} undesirable. Many food powders are powder {{ingredient}} mixes {{and there is}} little work reported on the <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> food powder mixes. This study focusses on the <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> food powder binary mixes consisting of a “sticky” powder (whey permeate WP or maltodextrin MD) and a “non-sticky” powder (salt, flour or paprika). The powders were exposed to 76 % relative humidity to make the WP and MD sticky. Force-displacement testing coupled with visual assessment of 2 particles in contact using a microscope were used to investigate the <b>caking</b> behaviour <b>of</b> the binary mixes. A “sticky” powder mass fraction of at least 20 % was required to initiate <b>caking</b> and formation <b>of</b> weak cakes. Increasing percentage “sticky” powder fraction above the initial caking percentage resulted in progressively stronger cakes, however the rate of this progression was much less for the stickiest MD powder. The “non-sticky” powders and how they interacted with the “sticky” powders influenced the <b>caking</b> behaviour <b>of</b> the mix. For example, salt formed the strongest cakes in the WP mixes but formed the weakest in the MD mixes. Ability of a “sticky” powder to deform and flow influenced caking behaviour...|$|R

40|$|<b>Caking</b> <b>of</b> food powders is {{a process}} that enhances {{particle}} bonding at temperatures lower than the melting point. Facilitated by the plasticizing effect of temperature and moisture it eventually leads to powder consolidation and loss of flowability that cause storage and processing problems. Although there are several mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>caking,</b> with some <b>of</b> them acting simultaneously, the dominant mechanisms governing the <b>caking</b> dynamics <b>of</b> amorphous food powders is the convective transport of the food material towards the bonding region driven by capillarity and resisted by viscosity. The overall objective of this thesis was to develop a rigorous computational framework for the simulation of the capillary driven bonding of complex food materials as a model system for the <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> amorphous food powders, with focus on the effect of environmental conditions and material properties. The framework was developed using Direct Numerical Simulation, that is, by simultaneously solving the full system of partial differential equations governing the capillary driven free-surface flow in a continually deforming particle. Direct numerical simulations enabled detailed examination of physical mechanisms at the small scale of the bonding meniscus which have so far resisted experimental understanding, as well as made predictions that agree well with experimental measurements at the larger scale of the particle size. The rigorous computational analysis enabled predictions of the effect of environmental temperature, humidity, and material composition on the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>caking</b> through their effect on the glass transition temperature. Results are also included demonstrating that both small scale physical phenomena as well as the macroscopic dynamics <b>of</b> <b>caking</b> are profoundly altered by non-Newtonian effects common in many food materials. Results from this thesis not only enhance our current scientific understanding of the physical processes involved in the <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> amorphous powders but the rigorous computational framework developed can {{have a significant impact on}} the rational design of more effective methodologies to reduce inefficiency and economic losses during processing and storage of food and agricultural powders arising as a result <b>of</b> <b>caking.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Powder caking is a {{ubiquitous}} problem, {{which could}} significantly decrease product quality {{and lead to}} economic losses. Hence {{it is important to}} know the conditions under which it occurs. The <b>caking</b> behaviour <b>of</b> three powder materials (PVP, HPC and CaHPO 4) has been investigated by the ball indentation method (BIM) as affected by relative humidity (RH), temperature and time. The resistance to powder flow, as indicated by the hardness is measured by a ball indenting the powder bed surface. The surface hardness increases with increasing RH and temperature, indicating <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> the powder bed. Moreover, the temperature and RH show a coupled effect on powder caking. Irreversible caking is formed in PVP and HPC at 75 % RH; the particles coalesce and the volume of powder bed is significantly reduced with time. However, the <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> CaHPO 4 is reversible. To examine the <b>caking</b> mechanism <b>of</b> PVP and HPC, the critical glass transition RH is determined at 25 °C and 45 °C.

40|$|AbstractIndustrially, {{after the}} {{crystallisation}} of lactose from mother liquor, the crystals {{are separated by}} centrifugation and then dried in a flash drier followed by a fluid bed drier. It is known that if the moisture content and/or particle size is not correct then lumping and <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> the lactose can occur in the flash drier causing operational problems. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the influence of water content and particle size distribution on the <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> lactose powders. Powders with different d 50 's and different water contents had their caking/clumping characteristics analyzed with a texture analyzer, a sticky plate and a blow tester to determine their cohesion. A theoretical approach looking at the capillary interactions of the liquid bridges between lactose crystals was taken from the literature to explain the results obtained. The results showed that lactose powder with a low d 50 can cake easily as soon as the water content is higher than 3 %. This cohesion between lactose crystals is due to liquid bridges linking them together. The number of bridges formed affects the level of cohesion: the more numerous they are, the more cohesive the lactose crystals are. Therefore, small particles cake more easily because the number of bridges in a given volume is higher than for bigger particles. It was predicted that the capillary force cannot hold together particles with d 50 bigger than 400 μm and that was confirmed by experiment. Finally, in order to prevent the <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> lactose powders obtained by processes such as a decanter centrifuge, the lactose crystallization step should be controlled to obtain large crystal (with d 50 > 300 μm) and/or the final water content should not be higher than 3 %...|$|R

During the transport and temporary storage time, the clay may cake inside a rail or road wagon or in a silo, and consequently be difficult to be discharged from the containers. This paper studied <b>caking</b> strength <b>of</b> a granulated clay powder with a certain water moisture content of 18 % for influences of temperature, packing stress and freezing time. The temperature tested was - 5 oC, - 10 oC and - 20 oC.

40|$|Chemical, pharmaceutical, {{food and}} feed industries, around the globe, produce large volumes of bulk solids each year. Caking is a common problem in the bulk solids {{handling}} industries which alters {{the quality of the}} end product and incurs additional expenses to the industry. Corn Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS) is a granular bulk co-product of dry-grind processing of corn grain into ethanol and is primarily used as a livestock feed ingredient. Handling {{is one of the major}} challenges associated with marketing of DDGS because DDGS is prone to caking during transportation and storage. <b>Caking</b> <b>of</b> DDGS in storage bins and railcar hoppers prevents easy loading and unloading of product, and thus increases handling cost. However, there is no understanding or quantification <b>of</b> the DDGS <b>caking</b> process or <b>of</b> environmental conditions favorable for caking. ^ Direct and indirect methods were employed to investigate the effects of moisture content, relative humidity, temperature and storage time on the <b>caking</b> behavior <b>of</b> samples of DDGS having different chemical properties at particle and bulk level. The DDGS production process conditions (Wet Distillers Grains, WDG: Condensed Distillers Solubles, CDS mixing ratio) influenced the product chemical composition. Moisture sorption by DDGS decreased with the addition of less CDS. Also, the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) increased with temperature and ambient relative humidity. The effects of protein and fiber on moisture sorption were found to be greater than the effects of other constituents. Based on this result, a model was developed to predict the EMC of DDGS from its protein, glycerol, sugars, starch and fiber contents. ^ Liquid bridging between the DDGS particles was observed above 60 % relative humidity at a constant temperature. Dehumidification solidified the liquid bridge, demonstrating the irreversibility of the process <b>of</b> <b>caking</b> caused by humidity. The glass transition temperature of DDGS was highly influenced by both the chemical composition and moisture content. Glass transition behavior indicated that onset <b>of</b> <b>caking</b> in DDGS occurs in the temperature range of 20 – 30 ºC depending on its chemical composition and moisture content. The bulk cohesiveness of DDGS depended on the moisture content, temperature and time of consolidation and as expected, there was greater cohesion between the particles as these variables increased. ^ A continuum model based on the finite difference method was developed to predict the simultaneous heat and moisture transfer in DDGS bulk during handling and transportation. The coupled heat and moisture transfer model that was developed can be used to predict the temperature and moisture distribution within DDGS bulk as a prelude to caking. A mathematical model was developed, based on tensile strength and cohesion between particles, to predict the buildup <b>of</b> <b>caking</b> (unconfined yield strength) in DDGS. The acceptable percent error of predictions indicated that this model can be used to predict the <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> DDGS bulk due to change in environmental conditions during transportation and storage. ^ The experimental results from this dissertation work and the prediction models will be helpful in development of quality control management systems for DDGS during production and transportation. In particular, the overall outcome of this study will help solve some of the logistical challenges due to caking. Additionally, the results from this study will contribute significantly to the science <b>of</b> <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> bulk solids. ...|$|R

40|$|PhD (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{swelling}} and <b>caking</b> propensity <b>of</b> coals may cause operational {{problems such as}} channelling and excessive pressure build-up in combustion, gasification and specifically in fluidised-bed and fixed-bed operations. As a result, the {{swelling and}} <b>caking</b> characteristics <b>of</b> certain coals make them less suitable for use as feedstock in applications where swelling and/or caking is undesired. Therefore, various {{studies have focused on}} the manipulation of the swelling and/or <b>caking</b> propensity <b>of</b> coals, and have proven the viability of using additives to reduce the swelling and <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> powdered coal (< 500 μm). However, there is still a lack of research specifically focused on large coal particle devolatilisation behaviour, particularly swelling and caking, and the reduction thereof using additives. A comprehensive study was therefore proposed to investigate the swelling and <b>caking</b> behaviour <b>of</b> large coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm) of typical South African coals, and the influence of the selected additive (potassium carbonate) thereon. Three different South African coals were selected based on their Free Swelling Index (FSI) : coal TSH is a high swelling coal (FSI 9) from the Limpopo province, GG is a medium swelling coal (FSI 5. 5 - 6. 5) from the Waterberg region, and TWD is a non-swelling coal (FSI 0) from the Highveld region. Image analysis was used to semi-quantitatively describe the transient swelling and shrinkage behaviour of large coal particles (- 20 + 16 mm) during lowtemperature devolatilisation (700 °C, N 2 atmosphere, 7 K/min). X-ray computed tomography and mercury submersion were used to quantify the degree of swelling of large particles, and were compared to conventional swelling characteristics of powdered coals. The average swelling ratios obtained for TWD, GG, and TSH were respectively 1. 9, 2. 1 and 2. 5 from image analysis and 1. 8, 2. 2 and 2. 5 from mercury submersion. The results showed that coal swelling measurements such as FSI, and other conventional techniques used to describe the plastic behaviour of powdered coal, can in general not be used for the prediction of large coal particle swelling. The large coal particles were impregnated for 24 hours, using an excess 5. 0 M K 2 CO 3 impregnation solution. The influence of K 2 CO 3 -addition on the swelling behaviour of different coal particle sizes was compared, and results showed that the addition of K 2 CO 3 resulted in a reduction in swelling for powdered coal (- 212 μm), as well as large coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm). For powdered coal, the addition of 10 wt. % K 2 CO 3 decreased the free swelling index of GG and TSH coals from 6. 5 to 0 and from 9. 0 to 4. 5, respectively. The volumetric swelling ratios (SRV) of the 20 mm particles were reduced from 3. 0 to 1. 8 for the GG coal, and from 5. 7 to 1. 4 for TSH. In contrast to the non-swelling (FSI 0) behaviour of the TWD powders, the large particles exhibited average SRV values of 1. 7, and was found not be influenced by K 2 CO 3 -impregnation. It was found that the maximum swelling coefficient, kA, was reduced from 0. 025 to 0. 015 oC- 1 for GG, and from 0. 045 to 0. 027 oC- 1 for TSH, as a results of impregnation. From the results it was concluded that K 2 CO 3 -impregnation reduces the extent of swelling of coals such as GG (medium-swelling) and TSH (high-swelling), which exhibit significant plastic deformation. Results obtained from the caking experiments indicated that K 2 CO 3 -impregnation influenced the physical behaviour of the GG coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm) the most. The extent <b>of</b> <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> GG was largely reduced due to impregnation, while the wall thickness and porosity also decreased. The coke from the impregnated GG samples had a less fluid-like appearance compared to coke from the raw coal. Bridging neck size measurements were performed, which quantitatively showed a 25 - 50 % decrease in the <b>caking</b> propensity <b>of</b> GG particles. Coal TWD did not exhibit any caking behaviour. The K 2 CO 3 -impregnation did not influence the surface texture or porosity of the TWD char, but increased the overall brittleness of the devolatilised samples. Both the extent <b>of</b> <b>caking</b> and porosity <b>of</b> TSH coke were not influenced by impregnation. However, impregnation resulted in significantly less and smaller opened pores {{on the surface of the}} devolatilised samples, and also reduced the average wall thickness of the TSH coke. The overall conclusion made from this investigation is that K 2 CO 3 (using solution impregnation) can be used to significantly reduce the caking and swelling tendency of large coal particles which exhibits a moderate degree of fluidity, such as GG (Waterberg region). The results obtained during this investigation show the viability of using additive addition to reduce the caking and swelling tendency of large coal particles. Together with further development, this may be a suitable method for modifying the swelling and <b>caking</b> behaviour <b>of</b> specific coals for use in fixed-bed and fluidised-bed gasification operations.

40|$|Sticking and <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> dairy powders during {{processing}} and storage {{is a serious}} problem in the dairy industry. The mechanisms for sticking and caking in dairy powders were identified. In high fat powders, fatty liquid bridges form between adjacent particles when the powder is exposed to temperatures where the milk fat is molten. If the powder is later exposed to temperatures where some of the milk fat can crystallise, then the bridges between the particles partially solidify, giving some strength to the powder. The mechanism was shown {{to be related to the}} amount of surface fat that solidifies during cooling, after the powder has been exposed to higher temperatures. Amorphous sugars were also shown to be responsible for the sticking and <b>caking</b> <b>of</b> dairy powders. Stickiness occurs when the glass transition temperature of the powder is exceeded. Above the glass transition temperature, the viscosity of the amorphous glass reduces allowing flow of amorphous material and the formation of bridges between adjacent particles. This mechanism was shown to be viscosity related and the rate of sticking was found to be dependent on the amount that the glass transition temperature is exceeded by, not the temperature and humidity conditions required to achieve this. This mechanism was shown to hold for amorphous glucose, galactose, sucrose, maltose and fructose. Previous work has shown this to be the case for amorphous lactose. A model was developed for predicting sticking conditions in dairy powders. This model required methods for predicting the isotherms and glass transition temperature profiles for multicomponent powders. It was found that the isotherm can be predicted from the weighted addition of the components isotherms. A new method for predicting the glass transition temperature was proposed and validated in this work. The new method predicts the glass transition temperature from the weighted addition of the glass transition temperatures of the amorphous components at a given water activity. This method gave better predictions than traditional methods used. The model for predicting sticking conditions was validated using a variety of dairy powders...|$|R

40|$|Caking is a {{recurrent}} problem in various industries, which occurs during the production, storage or transport of powders, {{and leads to}} lower production rates and decreased product quality. Given the significant economic loss associated with this adverse evolution, {{there is still much}} ongoing research on the subject. The complexity of this topic lies in the many parameters which can influence the caking phenomenon in an industrial context. Taking crystalline lactose powder as an example, the present study investigates how the washing and control of the size <b>of</b> the <b>crystals</b> along the production process influence the <b>caking</b> tendency <b>of</b> the final product under representative storage conditions. Alpha-lactose monohydrate powders with different levels of washing were produced at pilot scale, and sieved to separate 80, 160, 250, 355 and 500 µm fractions. Moisture sorption and amount of impurities of the different size fractions for varying washing degrees were assessed. Moreover the <b>caking</b> ability <b>of</b> the powder was measured with a ring shear tester. The amount of remaining impurities and the particle size distribution of the lactose powder were found to be critical to control in order to prevent enhanced moisture sorption and caking. Indeed it was shown that, for all washing grades investigated, the fines systematically contained more impurities and caked more strongly than the bigger particles. Industrials can use these findings to target the critical steps in the production process requiring optimisation to avoid caking in the finished product...|$|R
