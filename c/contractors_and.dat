5|$|In Arlington County, Virginia, 125 Pentagon workers {{lost their}} lives when Flight 77 crashed into {{the western side of}} the building. Of these, 70 were civilians and 55 were {{military}} personnel, many of them who worked for the United States Army or the United States Navy. The Army lost 47 civilian employees, six civilian <b>contractors,</b> <b>and</b> 22 soldiers, while the Navy lost six civilian employees, three civilian <b>contractors,</b> <b>and</b> 33 sailors. Seven Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) civilian employees were also among the dead in the attack, as well as an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) contractor. Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military official killed at the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, {{many people}} {{attempted}} {{to sell the}} cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. Health officials also recommended disinfecting private wells with bleach, due to possible contamination from the severe flooding. Many people {{took advantage of the}} flood victims, including fraudulent <b>contractors</b> <b>and</b> suppliers raising the price of goods more than is actually justified.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, {{largely based}} on livestock, has {{traditionally}} been the main occupation in the central and western parts of the county. There are a mix of large and small farm businesses, and a thriving dairy sector in the Vale of Clwyd. Many of the towns have livestock markets and the farming industry supports farm machinery merchants, vets, feed merchants, <b>contractors</b> <b>and</b> all the ancillary trades connected with agriculture. With their incomes on the decline, farmers have found opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and value-added food products.|$|E

5|$|In July 1995, the {{sculpture}} {{was removed from}} its pedestal and shipped to Stellar Artworks in Van Nuys, California for cleaning and restoration. It received a glassbead peening to remove the effects of birds, human hands, pollution and precipitation, plus a coat of incralac, a lacquer-based acrylic resin coating. The restoration was funded by an anonymous donor and involved Art Work Fine Art Services, Industrial Craters & Packers, O'Neill Transfer Co., Smith Masonry <b>Contractors</b> <b>and</b> the Regional Arts & Culture Council.

5|$|In June 1941, Colonel James C. Marshall summoned Nichols to the Syracuse Engineer District {{to become}} area {{engineer}} {{in charge of}} construction of the Rome Air Depot. He was promoted to major on 10 October 1941 and lieutenant colonel on 1 February 1942, when Marshall asked him to take on additional responsibility as area engineer in charge of {{construction of a new}} TNT plant, the Pennsylvania Ordnance Works, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. On this project, Nichols worked with DuPont and Stone & Webster as major <b>contractors,</b> <b>and</b> dealt with Leslie Groves, now the colonel in charge of military construction.|$|E
5|$|In all, {{there were}} 189deaths at the Pentagon site, {{including}} the 125 in the Pentagon building {{in addition to}} the 64 on board the aircraft. Passenger Barbara Olson was en route to a recording of the TV show Politically Incorrect. A group of children, their chaperones, and National Geographic Society staff members were also on board, embarking on an educational trip west to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary near Santa Barbara, California. The fatalities at the Pentagon included 55military personnel and 70civilians. Of those 125 killed, 92 were on the first floor, 31 were on the second floor, and two were on the third. Seven Defense Intelligence Agency civilian employees were killed while the Office of the Secretary of Defense lost one contractor. The U.S. Army suffered 75 fatalities—53 civilians (47 employees and six <b>contractors)</b> <b>and</b> 22 soldiers—while the U.S. Navy suffered 42 fatalities—nine civilians (six employees and three <b>contractors)</b> <b>and</b> 33 sailors. Lieutenant General Timothy Maude, an Army Deputy Chief of Staff, was the highest-ranking military officer killed at the Pentagon; also killed was retired Rear Admiral Wilson Flagg, a passenger on the plane. LT Mari-Rae Sopper, JAGC, USNR, was also on board the flight, and was the first Navy Judge Advocate ever to be killed in action. Another 106 were injured on the ground and were treated at area hospitals.|$|E

5|$|The first F-22, an {{engineering}} and manufacturing development (EMD) aircraft named Raptor 4001, was unveiled at Marietta, Georgia, on 9 April 1997, and first flew on 7 September 1997. In 2006, the Raptor's development team, composed of over 1,000 <b>contractors</b> <b>and</b> the USAF, won the Collier Trophy, American aviation's most prestigious award. The F-22 was in production for 15 years, {{at a rate}} of roughly two per month during peak production.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the project}} being split into two phases, it was decided for {{efficiency}} to design each phase as mirror image halves of one complete station with only the handful of items the whole site would share (like the flue stack and coal handling area) and so needed to be build in First Half, being the difference. This extended to seeking the same <b>contractors</b> <b>and</b> suppliers as worked on First Half for Completion. Unfortunately due to the decade timespan between comparable works on the 2 phases several manufacturers that had supplied First Half had merged or ceased trading, combined with changes in legislation, this meant numerous components and equipment ranges used for First Half were either no longer available for Completion or had significantly changed. Separately, operating experience over that timespan had led to design improvement in equipment and plant specified by the Board, leading to a few significant areas of the design of Completion being altered.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, {{war with}} France {{appeared}} imminent once again. After some discussions, {{it was agreed}} to adapt the 16th-century keep to enable it to hold six 24-pounder (10.8kg) guns; the roof was vaulted and a central stone pillar was installed to run up through the building, work estimated {{at the time to}} be likely to cost £4,122. The historian Andrew Saunders likens the resulting building to the various Martello towers being constructed along the south coast at this time. It was proposed to build two temporary gun batteries to replace the 1795 emplacements, which had suffered from the salt air and decayed, but the plan was turned down in order to focus attention on the redevelopment of the keep. The work was carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian <b>contractors</b> <b>and</b> was completed by the end of 1806.|$|E

5|$|On 6November 1981, the Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, {{presented}} the Queen's Colour to No.1 AD. By September {{the following year}} the depot's strength was down to 235 staff, but it pioneered the support of various new technologies for the Air Force, in fields such as electroplating, fibre optics, and electronics. It was also responsible for developing and testing components for the F-111, Macchi MB-326 and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet jets. From 1986, restructuring and outsourcing began to impact heavily upon the RAAF's technical services. In February 1990, No.1 AD came {{under the control of}} Logistics Command, formed when Support Command was split into logistical and training components. By then the depot's functions had largely been taken over by other units and private <b>contractors,</b> <b>and</b> it was disbanded on 2December 1994. No.1 AD was, at the time, the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation and, according to the RAAF Historical Section, the oldest continuously operating maintenance depot of any air force.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Camp Victory {{in their}} Humvee, the team {{encounters}} five armed men in traditional Arab garb and casual attire standing near a Ford Excursion, {{which has a}} flat tire.

They have captured two prisoners featured on the most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. The group comes under fire; when the prisoners attempt to escape in the confusion, {{the leader of the}} mercenaries shoots them, as they are valuable dead or alive. Enemy snipers kill three of the mercenaries, including their leader. Sanborn and James borrow a gun to dispatch three attackers, while Eldridge kills a fourth.|$|E
5|$|The Senedd was {{constructed}} in two phases, the first in 2001 and the second from August 2003 until it was {{handed over to the}} National Assembly in February 2006. Between phases, the National Assembly changed <b>contractors</b> <b>and</b> the project's management structure, but retained Rogers as the scheme architect. The building was nearly six times over budget and four years and 10 months late, compared to the original estimates of the project in 1997. Total costs rose due to unforeseen security measures after the 11 September attacks, and because the National Assembly did not have an independent cost appraisal of the project until December 2000, three years after the original estimate. Phase 2 costs rose by less than 6% over budget, and that phase was six months late.|$|E

5|$|The first {{pieces of}} track {{and other parts}} from arrived at the park from Germany in mid-January 2014. A month later, {{installation}} of the track began inside the mountain. By the end of February, erection of the framing for the 3D screens began. By the beginning of March, support columns for the outside portion of the ride were installed. The lift hill was completed {{at the beginning of}} April. The park opened to the public on May 4 but the opening of Guardian was delayed. On May 23, the park announced the ride would open the next day. The entire project involved 10 <b>contractors</b> <b>and</b> at least 47 workers.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} is fairly well understood by historians. The {{patron of the}} aqueduct– a rich individual or the city of Nîmes itself– would have hired a large team of <b>contractors</b> <b>and</b> skilled labourers. A surveyor or mensor planned the route using a groma for sighting, the chorobates for levelling, {{and a set of}} measuring poles five or ten Roman feet long. His figures and perhaps diagrams were recorded on wax tablets, later to be written up on scrolls. The builders may have used templates to guide them with tasks that required a high degree of precision, such as carving the standardised blocks from which the water conduit was constructed.|$|E
5|$|When World War II started, tonnage {{levels at}} the port {{decreased}} and shipping activities were suspended; however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I, was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators. The Brown Shipbuilding Company was founded in 1942 to build ships for the U.S. Navy during World War II. Due to the boom in defense jobs, thousands of new workers migrated to the city, both blacks and whites competing for the higher-paying jobs. President Roosevelt had established a policy of nondiscrimination for defense <b>contractors,</b> <b>and</b> blacks gained some opportunities, especially in shipbuilding, although not without resistance from whites and increasing social tensions that erupted into occasional violence. Economic gains of blacks who entered defense industries continued in the postwar years.|$|E

5|$|In a 1976 referendum, New Jersey voters {{approved}} casino gambling in Atlantic City. Because {{of concerns about}} organized crime connections to gambling, New Jersey enacted strict regulations that included licensing of all casino employees and <b>contractors,</b> <b>and</b> a separation of powers between the Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) and the Casino Control Commission (CCC). The Division of Gaming Enforcement {{is part of the}} New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety, and is responsible for investigating casino license applications, monitoring casino operations, and enforcing New Jersey's casino laws and regulations as defined in Title 5, Chapter 12 of New Jersey's statutes, and Title 13, Chapter 69I of New Jersey's Administrative Code. The Casino Control Commission is an independent agency in the state Treasury Department with both quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial powers, and is responsible for creating casino regulations, hearing appeals of DGE penalties, and make decisions on casino licensing. In light of such regulation and the uniqueness of casino gambling, New Jersey's twelve casinos are not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) or Atlantic City's alcoholic beverage control board.|$|E
5|$|After the {{invasion}} was over, the brigade {{was supposed to}} support the operation with bridging and infrastructure support. During the planning for {{the invasion}}, the engineers of the brigade were told that reconstruction in Iraq would be conducted by Department of Defense <b>contractors</b> <b>and</b> Iraqi civilians. They were not originally prepared to conduct major reconstruction efforts. When V Corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild Iraq, much of the invasion force, including the 130th Engineer Brigade, was sent to do jobs {{they had not been}} originally planned for, as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in Iraq were far below what was expected. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, the engineers engaged in a large number of initial reconstruction projects on basic utilities, including schools, water treatment plants, waste removal, and the nation's power grid. It was determined that the scale of these projects was much greater than what the US had expected or what had been encountered in previous contingencies. It was also decided that reconstruction was essential to the coalition since it would help win over the Iraqi people. By May 2003, the brigade had been completely repurposed. Though originally tasked with demolishing obstacles, building fortifications, and bridging operations, the brigade was tasked entirely with construction projects. This conversion was a difficult process, as the brigade did not have the equipment and specialist units designed to handle reconstruction on a national scale. As more US military reconstruction units arrived in Iraq, the brigade grew to eight battalions and three groups.|$|E
