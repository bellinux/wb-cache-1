5|$|On 3 November 1943, Brändle {{shot down}} two P-47 Thunderbolts fighters escorting a {{formation}} of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses {{on a mission}} targeting Wilhelmshaven. Later that day, {{he was killed in}} action west of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Following an attack by a group of Martin B-26 Marauders on Schiphol airfield, II. Gruppe scrambled to counter the attack. It is assumed that he was shot down in his Messerschmitt Bf 109 G-6 (Werknummer 26058—factory number) by Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) fighters under the command of Wing Commander Lloyd <b>Chadburn.</b> His body was later washed ashore near Zandvoort on 30 December 1943 and was buried at the Heroes Cemetery in Amsterdam (field 74, grave 405) one day later. His remains were moved in January 1944 before they were reinterred for a last time on 2 December 1947, this time at the cemetery Ysselsteyn (block CW, row 1, grave 25).|$|E

In the game, written by Colin C. <b>Chadburn,</b> a wounded foot soldier named Tom must defeat a wicked witch and an evil king who together cruelly rule the country {{in order to save}} and marry the beautiful Princess Rowella. Tom does not kill the villains, instead he just scaries the witch-queen away and banishes the king.|$|E
500|$|The magazine's {{two issues}} were dated November and December 1936, and {{numbered}} {{as a single}} volume of two issues. [...] The publisher was The Carwood Publishing Co., of New York, and the editor was Tom <b>Chadburn.</b> [...] The magazine was in bedsheet format, with 48 pages, and was priced at 15 cents.|$|E
5000|$|Compared to {{the earlier}} Wallasey twins, the Mountwood and Woodchurch were highly advanced. They benefited from an {{injection}} of cash from both Birkenhead Corporation and the Joint Tunnel Committee. They were given special Crossley eight-cylinder engines which were fitted with gears and automatic air brakes. New style telegraphs by <b>Chadburns</b> were designed which had a facility for braking the engines for rapid reversal, the telegraphs {{were part of a}} brand known as [...] "Synchrostep" [...] and were all originally unpainted brushed aluminium with shiny brass rimming. Woodchurch had its telegraphs painted blue, but Mountwood's became green and Overchurch had the same telegraph 'heads' however they were fitted into the wings and main control position in specially built units which also had instruments fitted to them. They entered service in 1960 and were an instant hit with ferry passengers. They were light, modern and boasted the latest in marine navigation equipment. They were given an orange and black funnel livery, with a red band just above the rubbing strake. In their early years of service both the ferries carried rope fenders to protect the strakes.|$|R
500|$|The Witch's Tales was an American pulp {{magazine}} {{edited by}} Tom <b>Chadburn</b> which published two issues in November and December 1936. [...] It was {{a companion to}} a radio program, called The Witch's Tale, which had begun broadcasting in May 1931. [...] With {{the exception of the}} lead story in each issue, all the stories were reprints from the American edition of Pearson's Magazine. [...] Alonzo Deen Cole, who wrote the radio series, contributed one lead story, and provided the plot for the other. [...] The authors of the reprint stories included George Daulton, Wardon Allan Curtis, William Hamilton Osborne, and John C. Haywood.|$|E
500|$|The Witch's Tale was a {{radio program}} that began on American radio in May 1931. A weekly {{anthology}} show, {{it was the}} first radio horror program, and soon became quite popular. [...] In 1936, the magazine The Witch's Tales appeared as a companion to it, perhaps inspired by The Shadow, a successful pulp magazine which had also been launched as the companion of a radio program of the same name. [...] The Witch's Tales was published by The Carwood Publishing Co., a small and relatively inexperienced firm. [...] The named editor of the magazine was Alonzo Deen Cole, who wrote the radio episodes, but the editorial work was actually done by Tom <b>Chadburn.</b> [...] Having both a pulp magazine and radio show act as vehicles for Cole's work is an early example of the 21st century's media industry's approach, with content tied together across more than one media platform, but although Street & Smith demonstrated that this could be done successfully for The Shadow, Carwood did little to promote the radio show in the magazine, probably because of their inexperience. [...] Only one more issue appeared, the following month; {{it is unlikely that the}} publisher could have received sales data on the first issue by that time, so there may have been reasons other than poor sales for the magazine's short run, perhaps including weak financing and distribution.|$|E

2500|$|The Nottinghamshire NUM officially {{supported}} the strike, {{but most of}} its members continued to work and many considered the strike unconstitutional given their majority vote against a strike and absence of a ballot for a national strike. [...] As many working miners felt the NUM was {{not doing enough to}} protect them from intimidation from pickets, a demonstration was organised on May Day in Mansfield, in which the representative Ray <b>Chadburn</b> was shouted down, and fighting ensued between protesters for and against the strike.|$|E
2500|$|By 4:00 am {{the dense}} fog off Whitefish Point caused Captain W.G. Rogers of the Cowle to check to half speed and blow fog signals at {{intervals}} {{of less than}} a minute. [...] The Scott suddenly loomed up full speed ahead broadside to the Cowle. [...] Captain McArthur of the Scott rang the <b>chadburn</b> for reverse and ordered, [...] "Hard left, hard left!" [...] It was too late and the Scott rammed the Cowle, cutting her almost in two. [...] The mate of the Scott blew her whistle, and when the Scott's engine found the reverse that was ordered before impact, the Scott's bow pulled from the massive hole in the Cowle. [...] The Cowle listed and began to founder. [...] A line was thrown from the Scott's bow to {{the deck of the}} sinking Cowle. [...] Three sailors scrambled hand over hand onto the Scott while other sailors ran for the rail and leaped into the lake in effort {{to get away from the}} suction of the sinking ship.|$|E

50|$|Lay's {{volumes of}} poems {{appeared}} mainly between 1927 and 1934.

Cecil Lay married Joan <b>Chadburn,</b> {{daughter of the}} painter Haworth <b>Chadburn,</b> in 1932. 'His origins, training and experience seem as if designed to produce that complex of rootedness and spiritual uprootedness that so often gives the artist's special oblique angle of view.' National Press opinions of his early verse comment on his Elizabethan frankness, simplicity, admirable lyrical impulse combined with tigerish intensity and focus, wit, beauty and blunt realism. His romantic sensibility was blended or moderated with classic restraint.|$|E
