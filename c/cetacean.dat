5|$|The <b>cetacean</b> family Monodontidae {{comprises}} two unusual whale species, the narwhal, {{in which}} the male has a long tusk, and the white beluga.|$|E
5|$|Beluga {{whales are}} the only <b>cetacean</b> being common around the peninsula. Other dolphins, {{including}} Atlantic white-sided dolphins, white-beaked dolphins, and harbor porpoises, as well as large whales, such as bowhead, humpback, blue, and finback, also visit the area.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises were, {{and still}} are, hunted by some {{countries}} {{by means of}} drive hunting. Some species are attributed {{with high levels of}} intelligence. At the 2012 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, support was reiterated for a <b>cetacean</b> bill of rights that would list cetaceans as non-human persons. The vaquita nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a predicted population of fewer than 100 individuals, and, since the extinction of the baiji, is considered the most endangered <b>cetacean.</b> Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch, competition (from humans), and marine pollution. Porpoises are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor.|$|E
50|$|In addition, Risso's dolphin {{is covered}} by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small <b>Cetaceans</b> of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of <b>Cetaceans</b> in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS), the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of <b>Cetaceans</b> and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific <b>Cetaceans</b> MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small <b>Cetaceans</b> of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU).|$|R
50|$|The long-finned {{pilot whale}} is also {{covered by the}} Agreement on the Conservation of Small <b>Cetaceans</b> of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of <b>Cetaceans</b> in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS), the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of <b>Cetaceans</b> and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific <b>Cetaceans</b> MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small <b>Cetaceans</b> of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU).|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{surface of}} the narrow scapula is not broadly curved as in most <b>cetaceans,</b> but tightly curved. The roughened vertebral border suggests {{the presence of a}} cartilaginous extension that extends the {{surface of the}} scapula like in modern <b>cetaceans.</b> Compared to other <b>cetaceans,</b> the infraspinous fossa is smaller, the caudal border is less curved and not oriented posteriorly. The glenoid cavity is very shallow and directed posteriorly, rather than ventrally like in other <b>cetaceans.</b> Likewise, the oddly folded acromion is pointing ventrally and posteriorly, and not anteriorly as in other <b>cetaceans.</b>|$|R
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} very {{sophisticated}} and effective predators of marine mammals. Thirty-two <b>cetacean</b> {{species have been}} recorded as prey, from observing orcas' feeding activity, examining the stomach contents of dead orcas, and seeing scars on the bodies of surviving prey animals. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as minke whales, gray whales, and rarely sperm whales or blue whales.|$|E
5|$|The {{long black}} and white tail fin can be up {{to a third of}} body length. Several {{hypotheses}} attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any <b>cetacean.</b> The higher maneuverability afforded by long fins and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates possibly supported this adaptation.|$|E
5|$|Three types {{have been}} {{documented}} in the Antarctic. Two dwarf species, named Orcinus nanus and Orcinus glacialis, were described during the 1980s by Soviet researchers, but most <b>cetacean</b> researchers are skeptical about their status, and linking these directly to the types described below is difficult.|$|E

The species is further {{included}} in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small <b>Cetaceans</b> of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of <b>Cetaceans</b> and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific <b>Cetaceans</b> MoU) ...|$|R

5|$|Some Mauritanian {{dolphins}} {{cooperate with}} human fishermen. The dolphins drive {{a school of}} fish towards the shore, where humans await with nets. In the confusion of casting nets, the dolphins catch {{a large number of}} fish as well. Intraspecies cooperative foraging has also been observed. These behaviors may also be transmitted via teaching. Controversially, Rendell and Whitehead have proposed a structure for the study of <b>cetacean</b> culture. Similar cases have been observed in Laguna, Santa Catarina in Brazil since during 19th century as well.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} <b>cetacean</b> live in rivers and lakes, but are {{more closely related}} to oceanic {{dolphins}} or porpoises and entered fresh water more recently. Such species are considered facultative freshwater cetaceans as they can use both marine and freshwater environments. These include species such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, found in the Mekong, Mahakam, the Irrawaddy Rivers, as well as the Yangtze finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that megalodon preyed upon many <b>cetacean</b> species, such as dolphins, small whales, cetotheres, squalodontids, sperm whales, bowhead whales, and rorquals. In addition to this, they also targeted seals, sirenians, and large sea turtles. However, the shark was also an opportunist and piscivorous, {{and it would have}} also gone after smaller fish and other sharks. Many whale bones have been found with deep gashes most likely made by their teeth. Various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales, and sometimes in direct association with them.|$|E
50|$|The dwarf {{sperm whale}} is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of <b>Cetaceans</b> in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area. The species is further {{included}} in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small <b>Cetaceans</b> of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of <b>Cetaceans</b> and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific <b>Cetaceans</b> MoU).|$|R

5|$|In addition, the {{population}} of blue whales occurring off Chile and Peru {{may also be a}} distinct subspecies. Some Antarctic blue whales approach the eastern South Atlantic coast in winter, and occasionally, their vocalizations are heard off Peru, Western Australia, and in the northern Indian Ocean. In Chile, the <b>Cetacean</b> Conservation Center, with support from the Chilean Navy, is undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered feeding aggregation of the species off the coast of Chiloe Island in the Gulf of Corcovado (Chilo√© National Park), where 326 blue whales were spotted in 2007. In this regions, it is normal for blue whales to enter Fiords. Whales also reach southern Los Lagos, such as off Caleta Zorra, live along with other rorquals.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are highly}} {{affected}} by bycatch. Many porpoises, mainly the vaquita, {{are subject to}} great mortality due to gillnetting. Although it is the world's most endangered marine <b>cetacean,</b> the vaquita continues {{to be caught in}} small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was estimated to be at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size. Harbour porpoises also suffer drowning by gillnetting, but on a less threatening scale due to their high population; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5% due to this.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are five}} species of dolphins which reside in freshwater rivers and estuaries. They are classed in the <b>cetacean</b> superfamily Platanistoidea. Four species live in fresh water rivers. The fifth species, the La Plata dolphin, lives in saltwater estuaries and the ocean. However, it is scientifically classed {{in the river}} dolphin family rather than the oceanic dolphin family. All species have adaptations to facilitate fish catching: a long, forceps-like beak with numerous small teeth in both jaws, broad flippers to allow tight turns, small eyes, and unfused neck vertebrae to allow the head to move {{in relation to the}} body.|$|E
50|$|Although {{they look}} {{very much like}} modern <b>cetaceans,</b> basilosaurids lacked the 'melon organ' that allows toothed whales to use echolocation. They had small brains; this {{suggests}} they were solitary {{and did not have}} the complex social structures of some modern <b>cetaceans.</b> The mandibular foramen of basilosaurids covered the entire depth of the lower jaw as in modern <b>cetaceans.</b> Their orbits faced laterally, and the nasal opening had moved even higher up the snout, closer to the position of the blowhole in modern <b>cetaceans.</b> Furthermore, their ear structures were functionally modern, with the insertion of air-filled sinuses between ear and skull. Unlike modern <b>cetaceans,</b> basilosaurids retained a large external auditory meatus.|$|R
50|$|The {{beaked whale}} has {{occasionally}} been hunted, but {{has never been}} a specific target. Blainville's beaked whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small <b>Cetaceans</b> of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the Agreement on the Conservation of <b>Cetaceans</b> in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The species is further included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small <b>Cetaceans</b> of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of <b>Cetaceans</b> and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific <b>Cetaceans</b> MoU).|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} not been hunted and {{has not been}} a victim of fishing nets. True's beaked whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small <b>Cetaceans</b> of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the Agreement on the Conservation of <b>Cetaceans</b> in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS).

5|$|Rorquals {{consist of}} two genera (Balaenoptera and Megaptera) and nine species: the fin whale (B. physalus), the Sei whale (B. borealis), Bryde's whale (B. brydei), Eden's whale (B. edeni), the blue whale (B. musculus), the common minke whale (B. acutorostrata), the Antarctic minke whale (B. bonaerensis), Omura's whale (B. omurai), and the {{humpback}} whale (M. novaeangliae). In a 2012 review of <b>cetacean</b> taxonomy, Alexandre Hassanin (of the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle) and colleagues suggested that, based on phylogenic criteria, {{there are four}} extant genera of rorquals. They recommend that the genus Balaenoptera {{be limited to the}} fin whale, have minke whales fall under the genus Pterobalaena, and have Rorqualus contain the Sei whale, Bryde's whale, Eden's whale, the blue whale, and Omura's whale.|$|E
5|$|The fin whale's body is {{long and}} slender, {{coloured}} brownish-grey with a paler underside. The fin whale is a large baleen whale that belongs to the <b>Cetacean</b> order, which includes all species of whale, dolphin and porpoise. At least two recognized subspecies exist, in the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. It is found in all the major oceans, from polar to tropical waters. It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. Its food consists of small schooling fish, squid, and crustaceans including copepods and krill.|$|E
5|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of Stroma {{are similar to those}} of the mainland. The island is treeless; its {{vegetation}} consists primarily of grasses, heather and small flowers. Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season. Both grey seals and harbour seals are present, with around 650 grey seal pups being born each year. Otters may also be present, as in other parts of mainland Caithness. The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns, guillemots, fulmars and eider ducks. The cliffs are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area. The waters off Stroma support a number of <b>cetacean</b> species including minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise.|$|E

5000|$|The Ecco the Dolphin games {{hinge on}} the idea that <b>cetaceans</b> are sapient beings and have their own society. In the Mega Drive/Genesis games, humans aren't acknowledged. The <b>cetaceans</b> call {{themselves}} [...] "singers". In the Dreamcast game, dolphins and presumably other <b>cetaceans</b> have united with humans in a cross-species society.|$|R

5|$|Ambulocetus natans, which lived about 49 {{million years}} ago, was {{discovered}} in Pakistan in 1994. It was probably amphibious, and looked like a crocodile. In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Ocean in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near-shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral molluscs. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed water {{with a range of}} degrees of salinity, some specimens showing no evidence of sea water consumption and others none of fresh water consumption at the time when their teeth were fossilized. It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations. Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking, or freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in the river. Hence, ambulocetids represent the transition phase of <b>cetacean</b> ancestors between freshwater and marine habitat.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009 it {{was decided}} by CITES that an {{in-depth}} review of the commercial dolphin trade conducted from the Solomon Islands should take place, this after the IUCN <b>Cetacean</b> Specialist Group {{came to the conclusion}} that insufficient population data exists to prove the sustainability of the wild captures and the current export quota of 100 animals per year. The Solomon Island Dolphin Abundance Project was established to provide data on the size of the local Indo-Pacific Bottlenose population and the sustainability of the dolphin hunts. A report published in March 2013 as a result of this effort indicated that the capture of dolphins in the Solomon Islands can only be sustainable at a very low rate and that previous rates of capture as seen between 2003 and 2013 would not be sustainable in the future.|$|E
5|$|Much of the <b>Cetacean</b> Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales‚Äîand Spock's initiation of a mind meld‚Äîunderwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E
