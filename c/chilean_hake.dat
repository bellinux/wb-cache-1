50|$|During {{the last}} 15 years, the hake fishery in Peru has {{declined}} significantly. This {{is due to}} overfishing, environmental stress, and decreased reproductive capacity. The <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake</b> population in central-south Chile catch exceeded 100,000 tons, and has since dropped to 40,000 tons in 2007.|$|E
50|$|In Chile, seafood exports, {{especially}} <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake,</b> {{have decreased}} dramatically. Hake export has decreased by almost 19 percent. The {{main cause of}} this decline is the February 2010 Chile earthquake and tsunami. These disasters destroyed most processing plants, especially manufacturing companies that produce fishmeal and frozen fillets.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{analyzed}} price determination throughout the <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake</b> market chain. To analyze the relationship between different prices participating in this chain, a VECM model was successfully estimated. One cointegration vector was identified. Tests for weak exogenous variables, causality, and significance of different variables were performed, and a parsimonious version of the model was selected. The results obtained in this paper outline a price determination process that, in the end, is governed by world market conditions. Moreover, the diverse links in the hake market chain seem to be well integrated, which implies {{that there is little}} room for domestic price determination...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{case study}} of the {{institutional}} changes occurring since the late 1990 s at the <b>Chilean</b> Austral <b>Hake</b> (Merluccius Australis) artisanal fishery. This high-value exporting fishery, specialized in selling fresh-chilled products, represents a pioneering case of self-government developments within small-scale fishing communities exploiting mobile marine resources in Chile. Despite entry restrictions and global catch quotas, this fishery faced a productivity crisis between the late 1980 s and {{the second half of the}} 1990 s. Consequently, the fishermen started talks with the Government in order to introduce new management rules. After gradual evolution, today there prevails a well-developed system of de facto individual non-transferable quotas which are subject to a high degree of self-management by fishermen organisations. In order to understand the conditioning factors behind the exchange solutions found at this fishery, an analysis is provided of the industrial concentration and the strategies of vertical control between transacting parties along the production and marketing stages. The contractual issues analysed are: the use of informal markets, interlinkage contracting, temporal specificity due to product perishability, the use of different instruments of vertical control and the influence of increasing industrial concentration as we advance through the wholesale marketing channel and get closer to the retailing stages at final export markets.

40|$|Publicación ISIThe {{intake of}} fish {{products}} {{is a major}} public health concern due to possible methyl mercury exposure, which is especially toxic to the human nervous system. This pilot study (n = 46) was designed to determine mercury concentrations in fish products for national consumption (<b>Chilean</b> jack mackerel, <b>hake,</b> <b>Chilean</b> mussel, tuna) and for export (salmon, Patagonian toothfish, swordfish, southern hake), and to estimate the exposure of the general population. The fish products were collected from markets in Talcahuano, Puerto Montt and Santiago. Samples were analyzed at the National Environmental Center by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Mercury levels in swordfish and one canned tuna sample exceeded levels prescribed by national and international standards. The remaining two export products (Patagonian toothfish, also known as Chilean sea bass, and salmon) complied with international limits, which are more demanding than Chilean regulations. Theoretical estimates of mercury intake varied from 0. 08 to 3. 8 mu g kg(- 1) bw day(- 1) for high fish consumers, exceeding the provisional tolerable intake for tuna, Chilean seabass, Chilean jack mackerel and swordfish. This group appears {{to be at the}} greatest risk from mercury contamination among the Chilean population...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{in-depth}} case study analysis about institutional changes occurring {{since the late}} 1990 s at the <b>Chilean</b> Austral <b>Hake</b> artisanal fishery. This high-value exporting fishery, specialized on selling fresh-chilled products, represents a pioneering example of self-government developments within artisanal fishermen's communities exploiting mobile marine resources in Chile. Despite entry restrictions and global catch quotas, this fishery faced a productivity crisis from the late 1980 s {{up to the second}} half of the 1990 s. As a response to this, fishermen initiated talks with the Government in order to introduce new management rules. After gradual evolution, today there prevails a well-developed system of de facto individual non-transferable quotas subject to a high degree of self-management by fishermen organizations. We discuss industrial organization issues which condition the exchange solutions found at this fishery. In particular, we discuss incentives derived from industrial concentration and buyer power, vertical integration and other strategies of vertical control between transacting parties at this industry; namely, between wholesale marketing brokers, exporters, processors, direct buyers of the catch and fishermen. Contractual issues of relevancy are: the use of informal markets; multi-dimensional contracting; temporal specificity due to product perishability; the use of different instruments for vertical control; and the influence of increasing degrees of industrial concentration as we advance through the wholesale commercialization channel, moving closer to the retailing stages at final export markets.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This paper {{examines}} codend size selectivity in the <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius gayi gayi) {{industrial fishery}} {{by means of}} four mesh sizes opening in the codend (100, 110, 130 and 140 mm mesh openings) and using the cover codend method. The data was analyzed by haul, using the SELECT model with both the Logistic and Richards selection curves. For each mesh size opening and sex the combined haul analysis was made with the Fryer model, and with these results we determine the Master Curves, by sex. Based on critical length and maturity length at 50 % estimated for this specie we determined the optimum mesh size opening for the trawl fishery. The rate of escape of cmomon hake increased exponentially {{with the size of}} mesh opening. The Logistic selection model was chosen based on the likelihood ratio test for all hauls analyzed. From the mean selection curves (incorporating haul variation) fitted to data for combined sexes, the total length of 50 % retention (l 50) were estimated to be 39. 3, 39. 7, 41. 1 and 43. 6 cm of total length for 100, 110, 130 and 140 mm of mesh size opening. The values of l 50 for females were higher than those for males. We recommended 120 mm of mesh size opening in the codend {{in order to protect the}} spawning fraction of <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake</b> stock and maximize the biomass of the cohorts.

40|$|Using {{the data}} {{collected}} in a size selectivity experiment on <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius gayi gayi) carried out in 2000, the selectivity parameters for four codend mesh sizes (100, 110, 130, and 140 mm of mesh size opening) were estimated and modelled by the SELECT model. These analyses included considerations of the sampling proportions of the catch in the codend and cover. Furthermore, the analyses took into account between-haul variation. The l 50 values were 30. 8, 29. 9, 30. 0, and 41. 2 cm of total length, respectively, values lower than the estimates obtained from previous studies. The contribution of explanatory variables to the selectivity model was also tested {{in order to determine}} the role of mesh size, catch size (in number), and towing speed. Increases in catch size and in towing speed were accompanied by decreases in the l 50 estimates. These results demonstrate how incorporation of subsampling effect and explanatory variables to model between-haul variation can improve selectivity estimates and management of a valuable resource...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of {{high concentrations of}} arsenic and copper was determined {{in most of the}} environmental matrixes under study (river water, river sediments, and soils), which suggests a real impact of the copper mining activity throughout the region, specifically the surroundings of the Caletones smelter, in the VI Region of Chile. The {{presence of}} arsenic in water and sediments is probably due to acid drainage, because pollution clearly diminished with increasing distance from the source. In the case of soils, they may be impacted by irrigation with river water. However, the high concentration values determined at sites far from the source suggest that soil pollution is more related to airborne particles deposited in soil. Arsenic speciation studies were carried out in river water samples and in edible tissues of fish (black kingclip, <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake</b> and croaker) and shellfish (clam, mussel and barnacle) samples, collected in the Pacific Ocean, close to the Cachapoal River outflow. In water samples, arsenic is mainly present as As(V); organic arsenic species (MMAA and DMAA) were not detected. In fish, around 80 % of arsenic is present as arsenobetain...|$|E
40|$|In 2010, two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in order to study ghost fishing generated by lost or abandoned gillnets. The first experiment was aimed to identify and quantify the number of captured specimens in intentionally abandoned gillnet between 45 and 86 m depth, which were periodically checked up to 156 days after being abandoned. In this experiment, 912 specimens of 12 taxa were caught, mostly invertebrates such as Cancer porteri (81. 6 %) and Platymera gaudichaudii (9 %). After the abandonment, the fish caught were only registered until day 63, while benthic species were captured during all the experiment. The second experiment consisted of checking and registering periodically the loss of height of an abandoned gillnet at 34 m depth {{in order to determine}} the reduction of the fishing capacity of the net. After 19 days of abandonment, the functional area of the net was reduced to 40 % of the original area, reaching nearly zero after 155 days of abandonment. In order to estimate the potential effect of lost or abandoned gillnets in <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake</b> fisheries (Merluccius gayi gayi), an additional information-collecting process must be carried out, mainly in terms of frequency of gillnets losses...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the reduction in bycatch and the loss of target catch in trawl hauls for three commercial crustacean species (yellow squat lobster, Cervimunida johni, nylon shrimp, Heterocarpus reedi, and red squat lobster, Pleuroncodes monodon) in central Chile. Two experiments were carried out using the covered codend method; the first used different mesh sizes (56 and 70 mm, knot-centre to knot-centre) and shapes (diamond and square), and the second tested different reduction devices (escape panel and sorting grid). We analysed the escape proportions of the species caught and the size frequency distributions of the target species and <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius gayi), the main commercial bycatch species. The results demonstrate that it is feasible to significantly reduce bycatch while keeping losses within acceptable ranges. In particular, the best option for yellow squat lobster was the combination of a 70 -mm diamond mesh with an escape panel that reduced non-target and target catches by 48 % and 7 %, respectively. For nylon shrimp, the best option was the use of a 56 -mm diamond mesh with a sorting grid that reduced non-target and target catches by 41 % and 11 %, respectively. Although the results for red squat lobster were not as promising, they will help to guide future research...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of fish by-catch {{was recorded}} and characterized by in situ observations {{in the mouth}} of a crustacean trawl using an underwater camera system with artificial light, at depths between 106 and 461 m, along the central coast of Chile. The groups or species studied were rattails (family Macrouridae), <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake</b> Merluccius gayi gayi, sharks (orders Carcharhiniformes and Squaliformes), skates (family Rajidae), flatfishes (genus Hippoglossina) and small benthopelagic and demersal fishes (orders Osmeriformes, Stomiiformes, Gadiformes, Ophidiiformes and Perciformes). The fish behaviour was categorized in terms of (1) position in the water column, (2) initial orientation with respect to the trawl, (3) locomotion and (4) swimming speed with respect to the trawl. Rattails, sharks, skates and flatfishes were passive in response to the trawl and showed similar behavioural patterns, with most fishes observed sitting or touching the bottom with no swimming or other activity. Merluccius gayi gayi was the most active species, displaying a wide combination of behavioural responses when the trawl approached. This species showed several behavioural patterns, mainly characterized by swimming forward at variable speed. A fraction of small bentho-pelagic and demersal fishes also showed an active behaviour but always at lower speed than the trawl. The species-specific differences in behaviour {{in the mouth of}} the trawl suggest that improvements {{at the level of the}} footrope can be made to reduce by-catch, especially of passive species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The diet of jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) off southern-central Chile is {{described}} to examine potential biases in {{the determination of}} their main prey. Specimens were collected from catches using different fishing gear (jigging, trawl and purse-seine), from July 2003 to January 2004, and from December 2005 to October 2006. The stomach contents were analyzed in terms of frequency of occurrence, number, and weight of prey items and the diet composition was analyzed using Detrended Correspon-dence Analysis. In the industrial purse-seine fleet for jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi), the dominant prey of D. gigas was T. murphyi. In the industrial mid-trawl fishery for Patagonian grenadier (Macruronus magellanicus), the dominant species in the diet of D. gigas was M. magell-anicus. Similarly, <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius gayi) was the main prey in the diet of D. gigas obtained in the industrial trawl fishery for Chilean hake; and, in both artisanal fish-eries (purse-seine for small pelagics and jigging), small pelagic fish and D. gigas were the main prey in the stomach contents of D. gigas. Cannibalism in D. gigas varied between different fleets and probably is related to stress behavior during fishing. The Detrended Correspondence Analysis ordination showed that the main prey in the diet of D. gigas {{is associated with the}} target species of the respective fishery. Consequently, biases are associated with fishing gear, leading to an overestimate in the occurrence of the target species in the diet. We recommend analyzing samples from jigging taken {{at the same time and}} place where the trawl and purse-seine fleets are operating to avoid this problem, and the application of new tools like stable isotope, heavy metal, and fatty acid signature analyses...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 An {{analysis}} was conducted to estimate the minimum mesh size for managing the common <b>Chilean</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius gayi) fishery. Secondary objectives were to establish the selective relationship between mesh size and fish length, to examine growth patterns and related parameters, and to estimate the critical age (or optimum size) at which hake cohorts reach their maximum biomass. Selectivity was estimated from experiments performed on the central coast of Chile using trawls with codends of 60 -, 80 -, 100 -, and 120 -mm mesh size. No differences in gear selectivity were found between sexes, thus a common linear relationship was established. The relative growth of hake proved to be allometric for both females and males with little departure from isometry, and was statistically different between sexes. The Brody growth coefficient, k, was estimated for each sex yielding values of 0. 1382 for females and 0. 3230 for males. Differences in asymptotic weight (Winf = 3, 167. 77 gr in females, and Winf = 776. 23 gr in males) together with minor differences in natural mortality and in the adjusted "age zero", importantly influenced estimates of critical age. The results of critical age determinations were 5. 7 years (49. 74 cm) for females, and 3. 8 years (38. 15 cm) for males. To expedite enforcement, and to produce a minimum departure from their respective age optima, a convenient mesh of 110 mm was recommended. This mesh will theoretically retain the hake at 42. 22 cm which corresponds to an age of 4. 21 years for females, and 4. 96 years for males. Additional studies should be carried out to confirm the selective pattern of gears on hake with tunnels and codends of 110 mm mesh size, and to evaluate the variations in catch caused by differences in trawling speeds, trawling time, type of grounds, migratory movements of hake, and other fishing variables...|$|E
