50|$|Tinsel wire is {{commonly}} connected to equipment with <b>crimped</b> <b>terminal</b> <b>lugs</b> that pierce the insulation {{to make contact}} with the metal ribbons, rather than stripping insulation. Separated from the core, the individual ribbons are relatively fragile, and the core can be damaged by high temperatures. These factors make it difficult or impractical to terminate tinsel wire by soldering during equipment manufacture, although soldering is possible, with some difficulty, to repair a failed connection. However, the conductors tend to break at their junction with the rigid solder.|$|R

40|$|Goal of {{this work}} is the {{development}} of a new package to be integrated into large-area smart textiles. The benefits of the well-known crimp technology are transferred to a new field. The so-called Crimp Flat Pack (CFP) is a lead-frame based electronic package that features <b>crimp</b> <b>terminals</b> instead of standard leads. The module can be directly attached to different types of substrates, in particular to fabric circuits. Its size and complexity can reach from a simple two-terminal package to larger multi-terminal devices. The standard sized module has a circuit board area of 2 cm × 2 cm and 10 <b>crimp</b> <b>terminals.</b> Eight of them are used for the communication between other modules and for mechanical attachment. Two terminals are used to attach a sensor that collects data inside the fabric. Mainly two tools were developed for the process. At first, a forming tool that bends the contact pins upwards and brings the crimp barrels into shape as well as the actual crimping tool that allows parallel crimping. On the system's side of view the module carries a simple micro-controller and passives. Communication between neighboring modules is done via I 2;C-protocol. Measurement of sensor date inside the fabric can be realized. The new package opens opportunities to the manufacturing of smart textiles as it uses standard manufacturing technologies as well as a robust, low-cost, and low-temperature interconnection technology...|$|R
50|$|One type of {{terminal}} block accepts wires that are prepared only by removing (stripping) a short length of insulation from the end. Another type accepts wires that have ring or spade <b>terminal</b> <b>lugs</b> <b>crimped</b> onto the wires. Printed circuit board (PCB) mounted {{terminal block}}s allow individual wires {{to be connected}} to the circuit board. PCB mounted terminal blocks are soldered to the board, but they are available in a pull-apart version that allows the wire-connecting half of the block to be unplugged from the part that is soldered to the PCB.|$|R

40|$|Generally, {{hand-operated}} and hydraulic compressors use <b>crimping</b> {{of connection}} <b>terminals.</b> However, this equipment often causes compressed defects because non-uniform pressure is {{applied in the}} circumferential direction of the <b>terminal</b> during <b>crimping.</b> A defective <b>terminal</b> often leads to fire in electric equipment due to overheating. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop a new crimping process for manufacturing highly durable terminals. MPC (magnetic pulse crimping) uses uniform electromagnetic pressure by a high magnetic field interaction between coil and terminal. This process uses only electromagnetic pressure for <b>crimping,</b> so the <b>terminal</b> can be <b>crimped</b> without physical contact, thereby producing a highly durable connection terminal. In this study, a MPC process was developed to fabricate a prototypical terminal. The result was compared with other crimping processes in terms of durability. The crimped part using MPC has a lower rising temperature and higher tensile strength than those using other crimping process. It is inferred from the experimental results that an optimal charging voltage exists in the MPC proces...|$|R

Although the Harbor Freight tool is intended only for insulated <b>terminal</b> <b>crimps,</b> and additional dies are not sold by Harbor Freight, this tool will accept Ideal and Eclipse interchangeable dies for other format crimps. The Harbor Freight tool is ratcheting and is adjustable, just as are the Ideal and Eclipse tools.|$|R

The process involves providing a crimping tool having an anvil and opposing jaw for <b>crimping</b> a <b>terminal</b> onto a stranded wire, moving the jaw relative to the anvil to close the distance between the jaw and the anvil and thereby compress the terminal against the wire, while transmitting ultrasonic waves that are propagated through the terminal-wire combination and received at a receiving ultrasonic transducer as the jaw is moved relative to the anvil, and detecting and recording the position of the jaw relative to the anvil as a function of time and detecting and recording the amplitude of the ultrasonic wave that is received at the receiving ultrasonic transducer as a function of time as the jaw is moved relative to the anvil...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} a new lab kit that is uniquely suited to teach power electronics: the Power NerdKit. The Power NerdKit is a self-contained prototyping system, which is easily incorporated into other {{systems such as}} an electric go-kart. Central to the kit is the card-rack prototyping area, where circuitry on PCB cards can be installed, interconnected, and tested. We present three prototyping PCB cards for use with the kit. Each of the cards has a common interconnection inter- face: up to five high current connections can be made via <b>terminal</b> <b>lugs,</b> and up to 26 low current connections can be made via card-edge connector. The first card provides solderless breadboard for constructing circuits and can connect with other cards through the standard interface. The second card {{is similar to the}} first, but is designed for circuits that must be soldered together. The last card, called the TriTotemII, implements three "totem-pole" circuits, which form the foundation of the converter topologies taught in the class. Finally the cards feature a unique method to attach oddly shaped devices using Unplated Through-hole Anchor Points. The lab exercises emphasize design. (cont.) In Lab 1, the student: learns why switching circuits are useful; learns a few necessary control circuits; and builds a switching audio amplifier. In Lab 2, the student constructs a 1500 W buck converter that drives an electric go-kart at variable speeds; they also design and build a 12 W boosting power supply for a switching stereo amplifier of their construction. In Lab 3, the student designs and builds a high-voltage flyback converter and an electric fluorescent lamp ballast. Lastly, in Lab 4, the student explores how power electronics are used to drive induction and permanent magnet machines using a teaching motor specifically designed for this course. by Mariano Alvira.

Having {{studied the}} {{synchronized}} multi-axis control servo system, some type automatic wire striping and <b>terminal</b> <b>crimping</b> system is {{developed in the}} paper. In order to realize the precise and efficient synchronized multi-axis control, the PVT (Position-Velocity-Time) algorithm is adopted. This algorithm allows user to specify the time interval of each axis' motion segment, so the multi-axis working sequence can be easily established in a tight way which augments the system processing speed and guarantees the system stability. Besides, by specifying the position and speed value at the processing point, the positioning accuracy and speed requirement at the processing point can be reached. In {{the design of the}} system control software, the modularization design is employed. This modularization idea simplifies the complex software design and allows people use the software more easily. Finally, the experimental result shows the system has a good synchronization performance, and meets the requirements of high efficiency, stability and positioning accuracy in practical production...|$|R
40|$|Many {{of us have}} {{constructed}} the front panel and chassis for crystal radio sets using 1 / 8 th-inch hardboard, purchased at Lowes, Ace, or Home Depot. This board is inexpensive, easy to saw, drill, and punch, and the resulting sets have worked satisfactorily. At the same time, many are aware, starting with the DX contesters, that using low-loss sheet plastic can boost performance when working with high impedance sets. The resistive losses in hardboard are hinted at in the experiments outlined below. Two measurements schemes were taken, using an 8 ” by 7 ” by 1 / 8 th inch piece of hardboard, shown in Figure 1. The solder <b>lug</b> <b>terminals</b> were – arbitrarily- spaced 3 inches apart. While the first scheme used {{was found to be}} incorrect, I’ll described it anyway, {{as an example of how}} one can go astray when “assuming ” a circuit model and ignoring part of the data obtained. Figure 2 denotes this first test circuit, consisting of a B&K signal generator, a 1 Meg ohm resistor, the resistance of the hardboard between terminals, and a two-channel scope (not shown). Assuming the circuit model was correct, the generator output was attached to channel 1 of the scope and the output of the voltage divider – between R 1 and the hardboard resistor – was attached to channel 2. Knowing the generator voltage, V 1, Vout, and R 1, R of the hardboard connections could be calculated: 1...|$|R
