50|$|Winbush {{is one of}} five {{children}} and the middle of three sons born to Harold Winbush, a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania steel worker, and Dorothy Winbush, a housewife. A depressed economy, low wages, and racial discrimination produced financial hardships for the family and in 1948 (the year of Winbush's birth), the family left Pittsburgh and moved to the east side of Cleveland, Ohio to begin anew. At the request of his elementary school art teacher, Winbush was tested and scored high on the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Test. Life changed for Winbush when he was bussed from his poor, Hough Avenue neighborhood to an accelerated school in a middle-class and predominantly Jewish neighborhood seven miles from his family's home. At twelve years old, Winbush realized differences between his educational experiences and those of his brothers. Much of Winbush's early <b>childhood</b> <b>narrative</b> is detailed in his first book, The Warrior Method.|$|E
40|$|The Writing of Childhood and the Childhood of Writing: Nathalie Sarraute and Autobiography" This article {{deals with}} the autobiographical <b>childhood</b> <b>narrative</b> Enfance (1983) written by Nathalie Sarraute (1900 – 1999). More specifically, it {{attempts}} to analyze the two directions Sarraute criticism took when assessing this particular work {{in relation to the}} reading of it as the story of becoming a writer. On the one hand, the narrative was seen as the beginning of something new in Sarraute's writing, on the other as a sophisticated continuation of her exploration of tropisms. Some critics contend that the writing performed by the childhood "I" of the narrative should be seen as the first steps towards becoming a writer, while others aim to show how the child's experiences of writing function as counter examples of how to write according to Sarraute, and thus could not be seen as representing a vocational story. The aim {{of this article is to}} show that Sarraute's <b>childhood</b> <b>narrative</b> is the story of un-learning how to write traditionally and an intricate reflection on the function and conception of autobiographical writing...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is better {{understanding}} how children think about the world and what they know about how it goes there. The ambition of the research is to find meanings that children attach to the death. One of the prerequisites of research is the assumption that images of death can not be asked directly without causing undesirable reduction of potentially rich answers. For this reason, Thematic Apperception test was elected as a tool and the children told stories to a pre-selected board. Eleven children, at the age from nine to ten collaborated on the research. All of them attended, or just completed 3 rd class in Prague's elementary schools. The research showed that in the stories of children who would still not reach the stage of abstract intellectual operations already appear phenomena such as paradox, the cycle of life, psychological causes as the reason of death, or the idea that memories of the deceased man is a "being with him "and can be a relief. So it seems that the time when developmental psychology theory replace the concrete to the abstract for some other, better reflect reality is not so far.

40|$|Narration, or storytelling, is an {{important}} aspect of language. Narrative skills have practical and social importance; for example, children who tell good stories receive attention and approval from their peers. When children accurately recount events surrounding an injury or dispute, vital information is passed to parents and teachers. Additionally, early <b>childhood</b> <b>narrative</b> skills are moderately correlated with reading comprehension in primary grades. Because narration is socially and academically valued, language interventionists often address it. The research literature on narrative intervention has most often included school-aged participants and those with language or learning difficulties. Only a small number of studies have investigated narrative intervention with preschoolers, and the supporting evidence is suggestive rather than conclusive. Outcomes frequently targeted include narrative story grammar (e. g., character, problem, action, consequence) and general language outcomes (e. g., length of story, mean length of communication unit, and total number of words). Results have been generally positive; however, the methodological quality of studies is poor. Therefore, few firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of narrative interventions. Because of its potential and popularity, the effect of narrative intervention on a range of populations needs to be examined systematically through high quality research. This study evaluated the effects of a narrative intervention on story retelling and story generation using a multiple baseline design with five target participants. We delivered narrative intervention in a small group arrangement. Materials, activities, and instructor assistance were adjusted systematically within session to facilitate increasingly independent practice of story retells and personal story generations. Results suggest that narrative intervention improved participants 2 ̆ 7 narrative retell and personal generation performance based on Index of Narrative Complexity (INC) scores. All five target participants made substantial gains in narrative retelling, demonstrated improved pre-intervention to post-intervention INC scores for personal generations, and these improvements maintained when assessed following a 2 -week break. In addition, we documented growth in general language measures such as number of communication units, mean length of utterance, number of different words, and total number of words...|$|E

With over 30 community organization partnerships, CYEP provides ongoing services for underprivileged children and youth affected by poverty, new arrivals status, minor crime, and disabilities; as well as hidden elderly, mental health consumers, while actively involved in environmental protection and disability rights. As part of the transformative pedagogical experience, students actively participate in the research process that represents a rich “transaction” with living veins of social and academic exchanges. Research goals are focused on effective convergent outcomes of the students, communities, and academic institution; grounded in cross-cultural perspectives. 1) The definitional model study seeks the understanding of a working definition of volunteerism and its operational boundaries for practice implications. 2) The investigating of implicit motivations in volunteerism {{has yet to be}} explored.

Em entrevistas individuais, as crianças foram convidadas a contar uma história a partir da observação de um livro de imagens. As narrativas foram transcritas e analisadas nas suas três dimensões centrais: a Estrutura, Processo e Conteúdo, de acordo com o sistema de análise proposto por Gonçalves e colaboradores (2001, 2006).

Three different themes found in the narratives are explored, since they are essential for the protagonist’s experiences of warfare and ight, and interrelated with the functions of the Orthodox church and its icons. The first is the girl’s sense of freedom and beauty at home and at the Orthodox church. The second theme is her loneliness and desolation when separated from her grandparents and her best friend during the war, situations in which the icons seem to participate in her despair.

40|$|In {{this study}} I construct, {{together}} with mothers with substance abuse, narratives concerning {{the lives of}} the mothers and their children as well as the supportive child protection servicies they have received. The study belongs to the field of discussion of the support and care methods for substance-abusing mothers and their children. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develope professional methods and practicies for social workers within child protection work. My task is to study, a) what substance-abusing mothers tell me about their and their children´s lives and about the supportive child protection work they have received, and b) how a reseacher and a professional social worker studies these stories while building, together with the mothers, a picture about the child and his/her family as well as the supportive social work needed. The research material consists of thirteen interviews. I interview four mothers who have been clients of a central hospital`s substance abuse clinic during their pregnancy. These mothers have altogether five children under the age of five years. My research method, and also my method of analysis, is narrative reflection. With reflection I mean that as a researcher I place the thoughts and feelings that rise through my professional background into targets of research as well as the mothers´ narratives. We discuss them together in the interviewing situations. Narratives mainly help us in this study to reflect and analyze our discussion and me to report it. The most important result of this study was to make the narratives of these mothers and children visible. Social workers in child protection can through these stories learn a lot about what it is like to be a substance-abusing mother and her child, as well as about how these mothers feel about the support they recieve. This study showed the importance of early assessment of the need for child protection and the importance of developing working methods. The support that these mothers I interviewed got was not based on scientific information about early attachment relations nor the risks and protective factors of these families. Careful planning, long-term social work and the importance of social support were highly rated by these mothers. However, the special services that child protection provided for these families worked, according to this study, very well as social support. This study supports the fact that substance-abusing women and their children must be taken care for together and that the supportive social work must be provided mainly at the early <b>childhood.</b> <b>Narrative</b> reflection and a sensitive way of research showed to be a good choise for this kind of a child protection study. They made it possible to build an ethical, co-working-based study together with these mothers. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, {{a body of}} {{international}} research concerning residential institutions for children emerged. This article focuses {{on the history of}} the Ghent orphanages (1945 – 1984). First, the population of the more than 1200 children and young people resident in the orphanages between 1945 and 1984 is analysed. This analysis illustrates a shift from a legal approach to a normative interpretation of the orphaned child. It becomes clear that the Ghent orphanages functioned, in the second half of the twentieth century, as a system of care for what we today would call youth “at risk” or “pre-delinquent” children and not “orphaned children”. According to this analysis, the focus shifts to the role and the functions of these institutions within the broader community of the city of Ghent. Although the population of the orphanages changed, the local authorities continued to use the name “orphanage”. In that vein, it is argued that concepts such as “orphans” and “orphanages” did not only refer to the classification of certain groups of children, but were also useful tools to protect the social order. An analysis of 45 interviews with both former orphans and educators provides an in-depth insight into the complex relationship between the educators and the orphaned children. In this way, the orphanage was studied not only “from the outside” but also from “the inside”, and by capturing the <b>childhood</b> <b>narratives</b> of former orphaned children it is possible to complement the “official story” with their interpretation of the past...|$|R

40|$|This study explores student teachers' {{perceptions}} of child-adult relationships, and their orientation to a teaching style. Twenty-nine stories of childhood by education students were analyzed for the child's perception of adults, using a framework developed from attachment theory and Baumrind's parenting styles. Adults {{in the stories}} were allocated to the authoritative, authoritarian, or permissive group. Previous to their writing of stories, students' {{perceptions of}} adult-child relationships were collected through two projective type exercises. Using the above theories, a table was designed to represent three t`eaching styles: secure-authoritative, avoidant-authoritarian, and ambivalent-permissive. Data from the exercises were analyzed for students' unconscious and conscious orientation to teaching style. Results from both sets of data were compared. Ten stories (Appendix 1) and corresponding projective exercises {{are discussed in the}} analysis. Summaries of stories are provided within the analysis chapter for ease of reference. Results showed connections between childhood relationships with adults and teaching style orientation. A child's relationship with adults founded on authoritativeness matched projective results, which suggest an authoritative teaching orientation style now. Similar matches were found for authoritarian parenting and teaching orientation, and permissive parenting and teaching orientation. A small fourth group designated "dis-orientated" by attachment theorists was not found, but a sample story (Appendix 2) from an earlier collection, is briefly discussed. Results imply that the dilemma of whether to provide theory or practice first in education courses, or of how much theory is appropriate, may be solved if students' own childhood experiences are used to develop their understanding of child-adult relationships and their potential influence on teaching orientation. Such stories offer a strong foundation for student teachers to begin their study of education theories, and could help students develop self-understanding and empathy for children.

40|$|Childhood is a disquieting age {{subsequent}} to the inexorable exile from love. After being banned from the only boundless union of love it will ever experience, the child sets upon a relentless journey to invent her/himself. Thus, the child surmounts its first creative challenge by transposing feelings of sorrow and loss; its first self silhouette is forged from the hardships of grief. The child assimilates its loss through symbolization, and in doing so, s/he begins her/his irreversible pursuit of identity and self-definition. 	This dissertation explores eight Latin American <b>childhood</b> <b>narratives.</b> The child protagonists of these stories reconstruct their world, so as to insert themselves in it. In order to achieve this, they must construct a first identity or façade through which they access their own narratives. The initial chapter focuses on three Andean boys who trial test schoolboy demeanors {{in and out of}} the school's enclosure: Timoleón Coloma (Ecuador, 1888) by Carlos Tobar; Gran Señor y Rajadiablos (Chile, 1948) by Eduardo Barrios; Los Ríos Profundos (Perú, 1957) by José María Arguedas. The second chapter explores the paternal home where three girls rehearse appearances and social behaviors: Ifigenia (Venezuela, 1924) by Teresa De la Parra; Balún Canán (México, 1967) by Rosario Castellanos; La Madriguera (Argentina, 1996) by Tununa Mercado. The third and last chapter visits the fictional childhood of two Cuban poets. We witness the dawn of imagery creativity in the poetic identity of two Caribbean boys: Paradiso (Cuba, 1966) by José Lezama Lima and Celestino antes del Alma (Cuba, 1967) by Reinaldo Arenas. Furthermore, each of these initial attempts at cohesive identity thrive in transition, not only because of the nature of their childhood passage but also because of the volatile social and historical landscapes these eight novels depict. 	After examining the different identity constructions in childhood, the following questions can be answered: with what symbolic resources do Latin American children elaborate their first identities? Who are their role models? What symbolic processes activate when confronted with threatening events? In order to answer these questions this dissertation draws insights from the disciplines of psychoanalysis and symbolic anthropology, especially from the assertions of Jacques Lacan, Melanie Klein, Gilbert Durand and Gastón Bachelard...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines Palestinians’ and Israelis’ narratives {{about growing}} up in Jerusalem over the last sixty years, beginning with the 1948 Arab-Israeli War known alternatively as the Palestinian Nakba (catastrophe) and the Israeli War of Independence. Scholarship on modern Jerusalem has generally examined Arab and Jewish inhabitants separately, at the expense of a more comprehensive perspective of situated, daily interaction. Moreover, descriptions of young people’s lives are often overshadowed by adult-centered narratives of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. This ethnographic study considers how the Conflict shapes residents’ <b>narratives</b> about their <b>childhood</b> in the context of Jerusalem’s post- 1948 history, as well as how the other ‘side’ is implicated in their stories and in the consciousness of contemporary youth. ^ Because political divisions inform a great deal of daily life in Jerusalem, I treat the physical and social terrain as the foreground for analyzing young residents 2 ̆ 7 experiences over time. In particular, I focus on the contexts for their routines and folk traditions: Sites of leisure and play, patterns of mobility and routes, and places of tension and conflict. Adults’ <b>narratives</b> about their <b>childhood</b> past were solicited through personal interviews, public story-telling events, and personal and organized neighborhood tours. Research with contemporary teens involved informal interviews and guided tours to illuminate how they articulate their sense of local knowledge as they navigate familiar and strange terrains around the city, while revealing their landscapes of play and imagination. ^ While often tinged with nostalgia and romanticism, Palestinian and Israeli residents frame the <b>narratives</b> about their <b>childhood</b> past in light of their social and political status in present day Jerusalem. In the tone and content of their stories, they express the precariousness or stability of their status as Palestinians or Israelis in this divided city, respectively, and evaluate how their national and communal affiliations impact their views on Arab-Jewish relations. A comparison of adults’ <b>childhood</b> <b>narratives</b> with the experiences of contemporary teens reveals that in comparison with their elders, youth today are less familiar with the ‘other side’ and with the city as a whole {{as a result of the}} limitations they face by living in a divided city. ...|$|R

The attachment literature globally shows that the qualities of IWMs are neither gender specific nor cultural specific. Procedures to evaluate IWMs in adulthood have been well established, based on <b>narrative</b> accounts of <b>childhood</b> experiences. <b>Narrative</b> procedures at earlier ages (e. g., in the preschool years) have been proposed, such as Bretherton’s Attachment Story Completion Task (ASCT), to evaluate attachment representations.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the tourist’s {{sense of place}} as experienced at Morecambe, Lancashire; it is concerned with emotional connections and reactions to place. This struggling traditional British seaside resort has seen {{the ebb and flow}} of visitors over the years and more recently regeneration. The qualitative research that underpins this paper consisted interviews with 55 - 74 year old repeat visitors from the North of England, reflecting the resort’s visitor demographics. This paper therefore reflects a perspective rather than the views of a wider population. The interviews reveal the important role of the sea and seascape to these visitors, this coastal environment lies at the heart of their sense of place. It facilitated a distinctive experience which centred around the inter-related themes of nostalgia, wellness and spirituality. Exposure to the open space of the seafront allowed a connection to something more substantial and enduring than themselves; this was considered thought provoking, uplifting and even spiritual. The respondents valued their seaside visits and percieved them as enjoyable, beneficial and a part of their identity. The tradition of seaside visits was part of their <b>childhood,</b> family <b>narrative</b> and something to be shared with children and grandchildren now and into the future. Their attachment to Morecambe fed into a positive sense of place, referred to here as seasideness, which relied on the distinctive socio-cultural and physical elements of the resort...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the Role of Transformation in Adults {{who have}} Survived Childhood Cancer Cathy Ann Goldstein The {{narrative}} stories of transformation of childhood cancer survivors {{were examined in}} comparison to the established research in the same area. The established research that is available is based on statistical criteria, which examines {{the quality of life of}} adult survivors. Based on such criteria, the quality of life of childhood cancer survivors has indicated mixed results indicating that more research is needed to better serve the growing population of survivors. In contrast, this study sought to compare the outcome of a quality of life survey versus the individual stories of survivors. The findings suggest that the survey does not accurately reflect the quality of life of the adult survivors. Also by including narrative stories this study offers a forum for survivors by giving them a voice.

5000|$|Charity Girl {{revolves}} around {{the character of the}} wealthy, athletic Viscount Ashley Desford and his mission to save [...] "charity girl" [...] Charity Steane from a life with her uncaring relatives. The novel also takes up the Viscount’s friendship with Henrietta Silverdale, his neighbour and <b>childhood</b> friend. The <b>narrative</b> opens on a conversation between the Viscount and his father, the Earl of Wroxton. Wroxton asks Desford to look into the affairs of his younger brother Simon. Wroxton fears that Simon has fallen into bad company and will destroy his reputation. Desford declines to interfere in Simon's doings, saying that the last person Simon is likely to listen to is his older brother. In the same conversation, Wroxton also reproaches Desford for having failed to marry Henrietta nine years ago. Desford protests that, while he loves Henrietta as a sister, there is no passion between them and that she cared to marry him as little as he cared to marry her. Later in the novel, it emerges that, at that time, Henrietta had begged Desford not to propose marriage to her, even though it was the wish of both their families.|$|R
40|$|The {{mention of}} the term “summer camp” often brings to mind cabins nestled in the woods, cool lakes, warm campfires and {{children}} having fun as they swim, paddle and play. At traditional residential camps children are imagined to revel in their freedom, overcome challenges, make long lasting friendships and develop into skilled and competent young people. How much of this imagery, however, is based upon a societal discourse constructed by adult values? How often do the actual experiences match these ideals? This study explores the issue of adult driven discourses surrounding the experience of camp by comparing the perspective of camp directors with the description {{of one of the}} author’s own <b>childhood</b> experiences. Using <b>narrative</b> techniques, the author composed two distinct descriptions of the camp experience including programmatic, social and emotional elements. The comparison of these two narratives revealed the possibility for distinct differences between the adult perception of the experience and how it may actually be experienced by a child. The areas of difference centred around both social and programming elements of camp participation which, when considered together, suggest the need for children to adjust to a distinctly different social setting in order to achieve the positive experiences reflected in our cultural conceptualization of summer camp...|$|R

Decorrente desta questão, e por meio de uma abordagem interpretativa, trilhada a partir de um percurso metodológico etnográfico, elegeu-se as crianças como principais informantes desta pesquisa. O processo de geração de dados aconteceu ao longo de 14 meses, com aproximadamente 800 horas de estada no campo, em que as palavras (anotações escritas) e as imagens em movimento (filmagens) ou clicadas (fotografias) tornaram-se essenciais para me aproximar às narrativas infantis. A interlocução com diferentes áreas disciplinares contribuiu para a afirmação da infância enquanto categoria geracional e campo de estudo em construção, assim como para interpretar as narrativas das crianças a partir de suas experiências de acolhimento institucional. O estudo estabelece como ponto de relevo que a composição espaço-temporal vai posicionando um discurso institucional revelador do lugar das crianças NA casa. A cronologia do tempo instituído como um tempo provisório e, consequentemente, de passagem, do ponto de vista dos adultos, é experienciado pelas crianças por uma outra temporalidade, de acordo com que lhe é próprio: um tempo recursivo, não linear, sem medida. As narrativas das crianças indicam outros sentidos atribuídos a este lugar (a casa), dando-lhe identidade e pertença particular. Suas experiências de acolhimento, sob a prerrogativa do protagonismo das crianças como sujeitos que se apropriam, reinventam e reproduzem o mundo, sugerem a possibilidade de um estar EM casa. Ainda por este estudo, evidenciou-se a ampliação da produção acadêmica entre os anos de 1990 e 2010, que diz respeito às milhares de crianças brasileiras que têm violado o seu direito ao convívio {{familiar}} e comunitário, mas mesmo assim são escassos os trabalhos que as tomam como interlocutoras nas investigações, fato que, por vezes, acaba por obscurecer o seu reconhecimento como sujeitos sociais de direito, restando-lhes apenas a condição de "meninas e meninos do abrigo". Abstract: This thesis shares {{studies of}} an investigation held {{in a context of}} institutional care for the early childhood in the city of Florianópolis, and started with the following research question: how do children from 0 to 6 experience their childhood {{in the context of an}} institutional care program? Resulting from this question, and by means of an interpretive approach, developed through an ethnographic methodological course, children were chosen as main informants for this research. The processof data gathering happened over 14 months, with approximately 800 hours of field research, in which the words (written notes) and the images in motion (filming) or still (photography) became essential for me to get closer to the <b>childhood</b> <b>narratives.</b> The dialogue with different area themes added to the statement of childhood as generational category and field of study under development, as well as to interpret the narratives of the children as from their experiences of institutional care. The study establishes as high-peak that the composition of space-time positions an institutional speech of the place of the children IN THE house. The chronology of time established as provisory and, thereafter, as temporary, from the adult point of view, is experienced by the children as another temporality, according to what is proper to them: recursive, nonlinear, without measure. The narratives of children indicate other meanings ascribed to this place (the house), giving it particular identity and belonging. Their experience of being cared, under the prerogative of children as individuals who appropriate, reinvent and reproduce the world, indicate the possibility of being AT home. Still yet through this study, the increase of academic production between the years of 1990 and 2010 has been evidenced, concerning thousands of Brazilian children that have had their right of family and community coexistence violated, but that even so the works that give them voice in research are scarce, a fact that, sometimes, obscures their recognition as social individuals by right, remaining only the condition of "boys andgirls of the shelter"...|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} of fourteen substantial essays {{has been designed}} to map the landscape of Irish fiction since 1960, and to assess the extraordinary literary achievement of Irish novelists and short story writers, North and South of the border, over the last forty years. As this volume demonstrates, Irish novelists and short story writers since 1960 have both continued and challenged conventional notions of Irish fiction; and they have contributed, in stimulating and inventive style, to the continuous examination of Irish identity, culture and politics, while making their fiction resonate with wide cultural, intellectual and human interest. The book includes essays which focus on major individual writers - Samuel Beckett, Brian Moore, Jennifer Johnston, Maurice Leitch, John McGahern, Patrick McGinley and John Banville. There are also general essays of a more explicitly comnparative and thematic nature covering such topics as the impact of modernisation on Irish fiction, the contemporary ‘Big House’ novel, the Proestant imagination, the ‘Troubles’ Novel, the importance of the past, <b>childhood</b> and women’s <b>narratives,</b> constructions of masculinity, and women short story writers. By closely analysing key texts, exploring the relationships between texts, and also between texts and their social, cultural and political contexts, and by examining significant themes and preoccupations, these essays offer valuation insight into the variety and complexity of modern Irish fiction from a range of viewpoints...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to expand}} upon recent {{research}} addressing {{the relationship between}} power and cultural stories of illness. It does this by exploring the stories of 'healing' and 'survival' produced {{by people who have}} undergone traumatic experiences such as childhood sexual abuse and a HIV positive diagnosis. The liberating and/or repressive potential of cultural stories of illness are defined in accordance with their capacity to produce 'minimal' or more 'reflective' selves, as characterised by Lasch [Lasch, C., 1985. The Minimal Self. Picador, London. ] and Giddens [Giddens, A., 1991. Modernity and Self-identity: Self and Society in the Later Modern Age. Polity Press, Cambridge. ], respectively. Two predominant stories of survival are identified in this paper: the 'healing' story and the 'normalising' story. Each of these are explored in an attempt to address the question: How do we distinguish between 'liberating' and 'repressing' technologies of the self with regard to the telling of illness stories? [Frank, A., 1998. Stories of illness as care of the self: a Foucauldian dialogue. Health 2 (3), 329 - 348, forthcoming. ]. Through an examination of survivors' attempts to overcome their traumatic experiences via the appropriation of various illness stories, it is concluded that this question can only be answered in the practical and social context of each individual's life. <b>Narrative</b> <b>Childhood</b> sexual abuse HIV/AIDS Survival...|$|R
40|$|Stress and {{negative}} emotions pose {{a major threat}} to public health, by increasing the risk of obesity. Since the management process for emotions (emotion regulation; ER) is developed in childhood, we present a novel conceptual framework model for the role of ER in the prevention and treatment of <b>childhood</b> obesity. A <b>narrative</b> review of the literature by electronic database search (MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge and Scopus) was conducted of observational and interventional/experimental literature on ER and obesity and the underlying concepts. We also present an overview of ER intervention techniques. Our model indicates that childhood ER is a link between stress and obesity. Stress along with ineffective ER leads to abnormal cortisol patterns, emotional eating, sedentary lifestyle, reduction of physical activity, and sleep problems. Simultaneously, a healthy lifestyle could show benefits on ER and in developing adaptive ER strategies. In the development of obesity and ER, parents also play a role. By contrast, effective ER skills decrease obesity-related unhealthy behaviour and enhance protective factors, which boost health. The literature contains some observational studies of children but very few intervention studies, most of which are pilot or on-going studies. In conclusion, encouraging effective ER could be a useful new approach for combating and treating childhood obesity. Future ER intervention studies are needed to confirm the validity of this model in children...|$|R
40|$|Studies on divorce {{have been}} well researched, {{the problem is that}} the Parental Alienation Syndrome often and perhaps usually accompanies divorce; therefore, the much-discussed {{negative}} consequences of divorce on children may well be in fact the consequences of PAS. PAS is identified when a parent (usually the custodial parent) behaves in such a way to alienate his/her child against the other parent (usually the non-custodial parent). These behaviours include brainwashing, manipulation, and control. With successful programming, the child will inevitably be alienated from the other parent. The purpose of this qualitative study is to gain a better understanding of PAS, to explain the mechanisms, and discuss consequences that occur in <b>childhood</b> and adulthood. <b>Narrative</b> stories were collected to illustrate PAS and the consequences. The sample is comprised of eleven participants; four men, and seven women who were self-identified as victims of PAS. The data were collected by semi-structured, open-ended interviews which were conducted face to face or via the telephone. The findings indicate that the greater the severity of PAS, the more serious the external and internal problems of the individual, and that damage to the child can last for decades. Those affected seemed likely to perpetuate the problem onto their own children. An additional serendipitous discovery was the paradox of the participant's recognition of alienation but also the denial of some, and inability to reconcile. The thesis concludes with several recommendations...|$|R
