40|$|Abstract. In this paper, by {{exploiting}} the log of <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> records, {{we present a}} solution procedure of mining user moving patterns in a mobile computing system. Specifically, we propose algorithm LS to accurately determine similar moving sequences from the log of <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> records so as to obtain moving behaviors of users. By exploring the feature of spatial-temporal locality, we develop algorithm TC to group <b>call</b> <b>detail</b> records into clusters. In light {{of the concept of}} regression, we devise algorithm MF to derive moving functions of moving behaviors. Performance of the proposed solution procedure is analyzed and sensitivity analysis on several design parameters is conducted. It is shown by our simulation results that user moving patterns obtained by our solution procedure are of very high quality and in fact very close to real user moving behaviors. ...|$|R

This system is really very helpful for the managers to monitor their employees through mobile phones. By using this system, the organisation can avoid the unnecessary involvement by the employees by monitoring their mobile phone usage and also by tracking their current location.
