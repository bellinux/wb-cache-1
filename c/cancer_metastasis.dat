The expression of chemokine receptor CXCR 4 was obviously up-regulated in the tissue with breast <b>cancer</b> bone <b>metastasis.</b> Compared with the tissue without bone metastasis, there was significant difference, which indicated that CXCR 4 played a vital role in breast <b>cancer</b> bone <b>metastasis.</b> ConclusionsThe bioinformatics analysis of CXCR 4 can provide a certain basis for the occurrence and diagnosis of breast <b>cancer</b> bone <b>metastasis,</b> target gene therapy and evaluation of prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Tumor {{metastasis}} is {{a complicated}} process with multiple steps, and liver metastasis {{is the most common}} metastatic mode of colorectal cancer. Deep understanding and study of metastatic mechanism helps to find solutions for colorectal <b>cancer</b> liver <b>metastasis.</b> Recent studies have shown that microRNA are involved in tumor metastasis and recurrence, and studies on microRNA associated with colorectal <b>cancer</b> liver <b>metastasis</b> can provide new thoughts for the development and progression, diagnosis and treatment, and prognosis of the disease. This article summarizes the research advances in microRNA associated with colorectal <b>cancer</b> liver <b>metastasis</b> and reviews the biological function and molecular mechanism of microRNA, which suggests that microRNA have a vital significance in the field of tumor <b>metastasis,</b> especially colorectal <b>cancer</b> liver <b>metastasis...</b>|$|R

25|$|PEDF, {{a protein}} with many functions, has been {{suggested}} to play a clinical role in choroidal neovascularization, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, diabetic macular edema, osteogenesis imperfecta and cancer. As an antiangiogenic protein, PEDF may help suppress unwanted neovascularization of the eye. Molecules that shift the balance towards PEDF and away from VEGF may prove useful tools in both choroidal neovascularization and preventing <b>cancer</b> <b>metastasis</b> formation.|$|E
25|$|An {{abnormal}} metabolism {{or change}} in the expression of sulfatide has also been associated with various pathologies, including neuropathologies, such as metachromatic leukodystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Sulfatide is also associated with diabetes mellitus, <b>cancer</b> <b>metastasis,</b> and viruses, including HIV-1, influenza A virus, hepatitis C and vaccinia virus. Additionally, overexpression of sulfatide {{has been linked to}} epilepsy and audiogenic seizures as well as other pathological states in the nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide also {{acts as an}} L-{{selectin}} and P-selectin ligand, but it {{does not}} act as an E- selectin ligand. Selectins are adhesion molecules that facilitate the capture of circulating leukocytes. Sulfatide is also expressed on the surface of many types of cancer cells and tissues. Accordingly, sulfatide may function as a ligand for P-selectin, which facilitates <b>cancer</b> <b>metastasis.</b> Additionally, when L-selectin and sulfatide bind, upregulation of the chemokine co-receptor’s (CXCR4) expression is observed, specifically on the surfaced of leukocytes.|$|E

25|$|If the biologically active {{molecule}} {{chosen for}} PET is fludeoxyglucose (FDG), an analogue of glucose, {{the concentrations of}} tracer imaged will indicate tissue metabolic activity as it corresponds to the regional glucose uptake. Use of this tracer to explore the possibility of <b>cancer</b> <b>metastasis</b> (i.e., spreading to other sites) {{is the most common}} type of PET scan in standard medical care (90% of current scans). However, although on a minority basis, many other radioactive tracers are used in PET to image the tissue concentration of other types of molecules of interest. One of the disadvantages of PET scanners is their operating cost.|$|E
25|$|In {{multicellular}} organisms, {{cells can}} move during {{processes such as}} wound healing, the immune response and <b>cancer</b> <b>metastasis.</b> For example, in wound healing in animals, white blood cells move to the wound site to kill the microorganisms that cause infection. Cell motility involves many receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor and other proteins. The process {{is divided into three}} steps – protrusion of {{the leading edge of the}} cell, adhesion of the leading edge and de-adhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal contraction to pull the cell forward. Each step is driven by physical forces generated by unique segments of the cytoskeleton.|$|E
25|$|A {{recently}} described {{example of}} this concept in action {{can be seen in}} the development of a lung cancer called NCI-H460. The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is overexpressed in cells of the H460 cell line. XIAPs bind to the processed form of caspase-9, and suppress the activity of apoptotic activator cytochrome c, therefore overexpression leads to a decrease in the amount of proapoptotic agonists. As a consequence, the balance of anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic effectors is upset in favour of the former, and the damaged cells continue to replicate despite being directed to die. Defects in regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells occur often at the level of control of transcription factors. As a particular example, defects in molecules that control transcription factor NF-κB in cancer change the mode of transcriptional regulation and the response to apoptotic signals, to curtail dependence on the tissue that the cell belongs. This degree of independence from external survival signals, can enable <b>cancer</b> <b>metastasis.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Studies {{based on}} genetically {{engineered}} mouse models of EPAC1 have provided valuable insights into understanding the in vivo functions of EPAC1 under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Overall, mice deficient of EPAC1 or both EPAC1 and EPAC2 appear relatively normal without major phenotypic defects. These observations {{are consistent with}} the fact that cAMP is a major stress response signal not essential for survival. This makes EPAC1 an attractive target for therapeutic intervention as the on-target toxicity of EPAC-based therapeutics will likely be low. Up to data, genetic and pharmacological analyses of EPAC1 in mice have revealed that EPAC1 plays important roles in cardiac stresses and heart failure, leptin resistance and energy homeostasis, [...] chronic pain, infection, <b>cancer</b> <b>metastasis</b> and metabolism.|$|E

40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} the second {{leading cause of death}} from cancer in the United States. Metastases in the liver, the most common metastatic site for {{colorectal}} cancer, are found in one-third of the patients who die of colorectal cancer. Currently, the genes and molecular mechanisms that are functionally critical in modulating colorectal <b>cancer</b> hepatic <b>metastasis</b> remain unclear. Here, we report our studies using functional selection in an orthotopic mouse model of colorectal cancer to identify a set of genes that {{play an important role in}} mediating colorectal <b>cancer</b> liver <b>metastasis.</b> These genes included APOBEC 3 G, CD 133, LIPC, and S 100 P. Clinically, we found these genes to be highly expressed in a cohort of human hepatic metastasis and their primary colorectal tumors, suggesting that it might be possible to use these genes to predict the likelihood of hepatic metastasis. We have further revealed what we believe to be a novel mechanism in which APOBEC 3 G promotes colorectal <b>cancer</b> hepatic <b>metastasis</b> through inhibition of miR- 29 –mediated suppression of MMP 2.

40|$|Standard of care {{treatment}} for colorectal <b>cancer</b> liver <b>metastasis</b> {{consists of a}} cytotoxic chemotherapy in combination with a targeted agent. Clinical trials have guided {{the use of these}} combinatory therapies, but it remains unclear what the optimal combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy with a targeted agent are. Using a genomic based approach, gene expression profiling was obtained from tumor samples of patient with colorectal <b>cancer</b> liver <b>metastasis</b> who received an oxaliplatin based therapy. Early passaged colorectal <b>cancer</b> liver <b>metastasis</b> cell lines and patient derived xenografts of colorectal <b>cancer</b> liver <b>metastasis</b> were then treated with oxaliplatin and a mTOR inhibitor.

Combination therapy with oxaliplatin and a mTOR inhibitor resulted in a synergistic effect both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest a genomic based approach can be used to identify optimal combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy with a targeted agent and that these observations can be validated both in vitro and in vivo using patient derived colorectal cancer cell lines and patient derived xenografts prior to clinical use...|$|R
