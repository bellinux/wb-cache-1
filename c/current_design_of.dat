The seal has gone through several revisions since the region {{was a part of the}} Northwest Territory. It is likely the original seal, which is similar to the current one, was created by William Henry Harrison during his administration of the Indiana Territory.

5|$|The <b>current</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> {{the seal}} was {{standardized}} by the Indiana General Assembly in 1963. During {{the meeting of}} the General Assembly, Representative Taylor I. Morris introduced legislation to standardize the design of the state seal. His bill described a seal that depicts a woodsman chopping a sycamore tree, while an American Bison runs in the foreground and the sun rises in the background. The leaves of the state tree, the tulip, were to be the border design. The bill passed the assembly that session and became law.|$|E
5|$|Windsor Castle {{survived the}} tumultuous {{period of the}} English Civil War, when it {{was used as a}} {{military}} headquarters by Parliamentary forces and a prison for Charles I. At the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II rebuilt much of Windsor Castle {{with the help of the}} architect Hugh May, creating a set of extravagant Baroque interiors that are still admired. After a period of neglect during the 18thcentury, George III and George IV renovated and rebuilt Charles II's palace at colossal expense, producing the <b>current</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the State Apartments, full of Rococo, Gothic and Baroque furnishings. Queen Victoria made a few minor changes to the castle, which became the centre for royal entertainment for much of her reign. Windsor Castle was used as a refuge by the royal family during the Luftwaffe bombing campaigns of the Second World War and survived a fire in 1992. It is a popular tourist attraction, a venue for hosting state visits, and the preferred weekend home of Elizabeth II.|$|E

Wales is not represented in the Union Flag by Wales's patron saint, Saint David, as at the time the flag was designed Wales was part of the Kingdom of England.|$|E
25|$|The blade is {{connected}} to a long cylindrical cane handle, {{similar to that of}} a mid-20th-century tennis racquet, by means of a splice. The handle is usually covered with a rubber grip. Bats incorporate a wooden spring design where the handle meets the blade. The <b>current</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> a cane handle spliced into a willow blade through a tapered splice was the invention in the 1880s of Charles Richardson, a pupil of Brunel and the first Chief Engineer of the Severn Railway Tunnel. Spliced handles had been used before this but tended to break {{at the corner of the}} join. The taper provides a more gradual transfer of load from the bat's blade to the handle and avoids this problem.|$|E
25|$|Ove Bjelke (1611–1674), who leased Austrått from 1641, {{took over}} both Austrått and the {{position}} of Chancellor for Norway when his father, Jens, died in 1659. As feudal overlord to Bakke kloster Ove {{had been able to}} stay at Austrått on a regular basis and oversee operations there. Much of the manor as it stands today is the result of his efforts. The <b>current</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the central building, the wings, the gateway and the design of the main staircase have been attributed to him. Ove Bjelke was educated in Padua, Italy, and sources indicate that both the central tower and pillar are based on comparable structures there. At the same time the central axis of the loggia (a gallery of Italian design) provides a clear expression of an Absolute monarchy-esque world view, with the Chancellor as the worldly authority, and thus as God's representative.|$|E

500|$|Beneath the Henrician castle is {{a complex}} of {{artillery}} positions, {{cut out of the}} rock from around 1854 onwards, and collectively known as the Grand Sea Battery. The Grand Sea Battery was served by a 19th-century magazine for holding gunpowder, approximately [...] with stone walls and bomb-proof brick roof, topped with turf to help to protect against incoming shells. For many years the magazine was protected by an additional concrete fortification, but this was removed in 1970. There are two gun platforms along the west and east sides of the complex, [...] and [...] across respectively and known as the Lower Gun Battery. The <b>current</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the western platform dates from the 1890s, with two raised concrete platforms for rotating guns and a brick-vaulted magazine just behind the battery.

500|$|Officer grades up to {{lieutenant}} colonel reflect progression {{in training and}} organizational seniority, rather than command authority. Because of this, {{it is not uncommon}} for senior members commanding groups and squadrons to have members of superior grades serving under them. Current, retired and former members of the United States Armed Forces may be promoted directly to the CAP grade equivalent to their military grade, although some choose to follow the same standards as non-prior-service members. Except for a few exceptional cases, senior members are only promoted to the grade of CAP colonel upon appointment as a Region Commander, responsible for overseeing multiple states, or Wing Commander, responsible for the administration of CAP units across an entire state. Former military enlisted personnel may choose to retain their grade as senior members, with grades E-5 (CAP Staff Sergeant) through E-9 (CAP Chief Master Sergeant) available. Former CAP National Commander, Maj Gen Carr, unveiled plans to restructure the CAP NCO program to allow individuals to 'enlist' as an NCO and progress through a specific professional development program. According to an AF.mil article on the subject, [...] "The <b>current</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the NCO corps in the CAP only allows former active-duty NCOs to be a part of the corps, with no upgrade training for promotion within the ranks. The newly signed corps structure will mirror the Air Force NCO force structure with an established process to promote and develop NCOs.". Maj.Gen. Carr's plan did not follow through but in November 2016, a new NCO Professional Development program was implemented allowing NCO's to promote as you would in the officer ranks, furthering the ability of the CAP NCO corp.|$|E
