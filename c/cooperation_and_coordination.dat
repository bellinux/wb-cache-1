5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli {{government in a}} series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords. The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to multi-robot exploration of unstructured environment in which both multi-robot task <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> behavior <b>coordination</b> strategies are implemented. The task cooperation is achieved by assigning exploring goals to robots dynamically in a cooperative way, <b>and</b> the behavior <b>coordination</b> of robots are carried out with modified artificial potential field to assure a balanced distribution along the frontier areas as soon as possible. In this way, unnecessary detours are avoided so as to make the exploration process more efficient. A series of simulation results demonstrate that the task <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> behavior <b>coordination</b> among multiple robots are well implemented to distribute various robots over the unknown complex environment properly and accomplish the exploration mission effectively...|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to community <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination,</b> Fitzpatrick {{shows that the}} incorporation of open standards and built-in extensibility are crucial {{to the development of}} successful digital text preservation practices. Included in these practices are three key components: the development of standards for text markup, so that digital texts can be read across a variety of platforms; the inclusion of rich metadata, so that digital texts can be located reliably; and the preservation of access to digital texts themselves. To support her argument for social solutions, Fitzpatrick examines several successful projects concerned with the development of text markup, metadata, and access standards and practices (including TEI, DOI, and LOCKSS) and shows that each is based {{in the creation of a}} community organization that values openness and extensibility.|$|E

25|$|The Global Initiative {{is based}} on a simple principle: human {{trafficking}} is a crime of such magnitude and atrocity that it cannot be dealt with successfully by any government alone. This global problem requires a global, multi-stakeholder strategy that builds on national efforts throughout the world. To pave the way for this strategy, stakeholders must coordinate efforts already underway, increase knowledge and awareness, provide technical assistance, promote effective rights-based responses, build capacity of state and non-state stakeholders, foster partnerships for joint action, and above all, ensure that everybody takes responsibility for this fight. By encouraging and facilitating <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination,</b> UN.GIFT aims to create synergies among the anti-trafficking activities of UN agencies, international organizations and other stakeholders to develop the most efficient and cost-effective tools and good practices.|$|E

The warplanes sent there, for example, were [...] "far inferior" [...] to Japanese planes, and morale was bad. He told Forrestal that the Pacific Fleet had a [...] "critical" [...] need for 6,800 additional experienced men. Johnson prepared a twelve-point program to upgrade the effort in the region, stressing [...] "greater <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> <b>coordination</b> within the various commands and between the different war theaters." [...] Congress responded by making Johnson chairman of a high-powered subcommittee of the Naval Affairs Committee, with a mission {{similar to that of the}} Truman Committee in the Senate. He probed the peacetime [...] "business as usual" [...] inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals shape up and get the job done. Johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often; organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him. Johnson's biographer, Robert Dallek concludes, [...] "The mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy Johnson's personal and political wishes, but it also represented a genuine effort on his part, however misplaced, to improve the lot of America's fighting men." ...|$|E
