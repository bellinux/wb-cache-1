5|$|After {{reaching}} this strength, {{the storm}} slowed and gradually {{took a more}} northwesterly course, heading towards Pinar del Río Province in western Cuba. On September16, the system attained winds of 75mph (120km/h), what would now be considered a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.

5|$|Around 0000UTC on September25, the {{disturbance}} was sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression. Shortly after, the NHC issued their first advisory {{on the system}} as it intensified into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Kyle. The <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was slightly elongated but moderate wind shear continued to impact the circulation. Kyle track northward {{in response to an}} area of high pressure east of Bermuda and an area of low pressure along the eastern United States. The sheared structure of the storm led to problems with recording the intensity of the storm throughout the day. Hurricane Hunters continuously flew into the storm to record information; however, their estimates were considered too high as the storm was disorganized.|$|E
5|$|As Zeke {{continued}} to be hampered by strong shear, it gradually began to turn towards the north as the trough that caused it to weaken moved further east. Late on October27, convection redeveloped over the center of circulation, allowing the storm to re-attain tropical storm intensity. The strengthening followed {{the passage of a}} shortwave trough; however, shear over the system remained strong. Despite the unfavorable conditions, Zeke maintained its intensity, through intermittent bursts of convection, and began to turn towards the northeast. Late on October29, a large burst of deep convection over the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> allowed for intensification. Around this time, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) with a barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg).|$|E

5|$|Josephine {{continued}} to intensify throughout the afternoon as <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> became more symmetrical.

5|$|Beryl {{maintained}} peak winds {{for about}} 18hours as it paralleled the Mid-Atlantic and New Jersey coasts, during which an eye-like feature {{developed in the}} center of the convection. Late on July 20, it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters. Steering winds ahead of an approaching mid-level trough caused Beryl to accelerate northeastward, and early on July 21 the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> crossed the island of Nantucket. The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters, and shortly after 1200UTC on July 21 Beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod. Hours later, it made landfall in southwestern Nova Scotia, and on July 22 the extratropical remnants of Beryl merged with an approaching cold front over Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} on September21 Harvey {{accelerated}} slightly and turned southeastward. Although the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was poorly defined {{at the time}} and located to the northwest of the main area of thunderstorm activity, convection was strong in nature. Later that day the storm curved towards the east while approaching Florida. At around 1700UTC on September21 Harvey made landfall near Everglades City, Florida with sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h). The storm further accelerated across the Florida Peninsula and quickly merged with a developing storm off the coast of South Carolina at 0600UTC on September22. Although the remnants of Harvey became unidentifiable later that day, Environment Canada reported that the system crossed Newfoundland before dissipating on September24.|$|E
5|$|Cold {{air from}} the {{remnants}} of a cold front became entrained within the circulation; however, the cold air gradually warmed. On October9, winds increased to gale-force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm, at which time it was given the name Bravo. By October10, Bravo had intensified substantially, as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane-force winds roughly 15mi (25km) from the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> Following this finding, the National Hurricane Center reclassified the system as a tropical system and renamed it Fran, dropping its previous designation of Bravo. Upon becoming tropical, Fran developed a strong outflow and several convective feeder bands. Additionally, the storm had developed a 35mi (55km) wide eye.|$|E
50|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} typically {{form from}} large, disorganized areas of disturbed weather in tropical regions. As more thunderstorms form and gather, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> develops rainbands which start rotating around a common center. As <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> gains strength, {{a ring of}} stronger convection forms at a certain distance from <b>the</b> rotational <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developing <b>storm.</b> Since stronger thunderstorms and heavier rain mark areas <b>of</b> stronger updrafts, <b>the</b> barometric pressure at the surface begins to drop, and air begins to build up in <b>the</b> upper levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclone. This results in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> an upper level anticyclone, or an area of high atmospheric pressure above the central dense overcast. Consequently, most of this built up air flows outward anticyclonically above the tropical cyclone. Outside the forming eye, the anticyclone at <b>the</b> upper levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere enhances the flow towards <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclone, pushing air towards the eyewall and causing a positive feedback loop.|$|R
5|$|Overnight, {{convection}} {{associated with}} Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics, but still retained its status.

5|$|Immediately after {{becoming}} a tropical storm, {{the movement of}} Tanya became hindered by a nearby upper-level low, and it quickly turned eastward before virtually stalling early on October28. The upper-level low also influenced Tanya in giving it some subtropical characteristics, including a comma-shaped cloud band and maximum winds far from the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> at the time. Despite that, the storm gradually strengthened as it remained over warm waters of about 81°F (27°C). That afternoon, it gained full tropical characteristics, as an eye featured was beginning to form in the central dense overcast. The eye became clearly defined, although it was small in size. Early on October 29, Tropical Storm Tanya was upgraded to a hurricane, the eleventh of the 1995season, as it turned northward {{in response to the}} nearby low.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 Myanmar cyclone was {{considered}} the worst to strike the country since 1968. The second tropical cyclone of the 2004 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, it formed as a depression on May16 in the central Bay of Bengal. With low wind shear and a surge in the monsoon trough, the storm intensified while meandering over open waters. The storm eventually began a steady northeastward motion due to a ridge to the north over India. While approaching land, an eye developed in the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> indicative of a strong cyclone. On May19, the cyclone made landfall along northwestern Myanmar near Sittwe, with maximum sustained winds estimated at 165km/h (105mph) by the India Meteorological Department. The storm rapidly weakened over land, although its remnants spread rainfall into northern Thailand and Yunnan province in China.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} {{retained a}} large circulation during its formative stages, {{as indicated by}} both satellite observations and data from rawinsondes. As its cloud pattern continued to coalesce, the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Gert at 0900UTC on September15. After tracking west-northwestward, the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> moved ashore near Bluefields, Nicaragua, around 1800UTC that day, with winds of 40mph (65km/h). Its interaction with land impeded further development, and Gert weakened back to a tropical depression six hours later. Despite the center being inland for nearly two days, parts of the large circulation stayed over the adjacent Caribbean and Pacific waters. This allowed Gert to remain a tropical cyclone while trekking northwestward through Nicaragua and Honduras, defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of its dissipation over land.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>storm</b> had {{undertaken}} a slow northeast motion {{early on}} February13 before turning southeast {{in response to}} a mid-level ridge located northeast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclone. Convective banding features developed close to <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> circulation as <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> began to undergo explosive intensification. Around 1200UTC, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> attained Severe Tropical Cyclone status as winds reached 120km/h (75mph 10-minute winds) and a small, irregularly shaped, eye began to develop. The JTWC, however, assessed Nancy to have been substantially weaker until 0000UTC on February14, at which time they reported a 95km/h (60mph) increase in winds, attaining minimal Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale.|$|R

Approximately one hour into the flight, radio contact was lost with the plane when it entered the region near Vienne which was also close to <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> a <b>storm.</b> <b>The</b> plane's four occupants endured twenty minutes of severe turbulence which bounced their small plane {{up and down as}} much as several thousand feet at a time.|$|R
5|$|According to the Bermuda Weather Service, <b>the</b> islands <b>of</b> Bermuda {{experience}} a damaging tropical cyclone once every {{six to seven}} years, on average. Due to <b>the</b> small area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island chain, landfalls and direct hits are rare. Strictly speaking, only nine landfalls have occurred during years included in the official Atlantic hurricane database, starting in 1851. When hurricanes Fay and Gonzalo struck Bermuda just days apart in October 2014, that season became the first to produce two landfalls. Two damaging storms impacted Bermuda in September 1899, but <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>storm</b> narrowly missed <b>the</b> islands. Tropical cyclones, and their antecedent or remnant weather systems, have affected the territory in all seasons, most frequently {{in the late summer}} months. A study of recorded storms from 1609 to 1996 found that direct hits from hurricanes were most common in early September and late October, with an intervening relative lull creating two distinct 'seasons'.|$|R
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was located within {{an area of}} weak steering currents. Initially it was forecast to remain offshore; with warm waters and light wind shear, the depression was forecast to intensify into a strong tropical storm, and possibly attain hurricane status. However, the circulation was difficult to locate, and as such its exact motion was uncertain. Ships in the region confirmed the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> as further northeast than previously thought, but also confirmed tropical storm force winds; as a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norman. Strengthening continued, and Norman attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), shortly prior to making landfall west of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, late on September20.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 11, Hernan was {{downgraded}} to {{a tropical}} storm. Deep convection diminished around the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> and by August 12, {{almost all of}} the deep convection dissipated as Hernan continued to weaken. Over 23°C water, only a swirl of clouds remained and the storm was barely a tropical system. Later that night, Hernan had degenerated into a remnant low, and the final advisory was issued by the National Hurricane Center. The remnant low still retained tropical storm-force winds for a short while before weakening further by the next morning. The low moved towards the west-southwest over the next several days before dissipating 460mi (740km) southeast of the Island of Hawaii on August 16. The remnant low-pressure area of Hernan later brought moisture to the island of Hawaii, causing cloud and shower activity. The associated rainfall was light and insignificant.|$|E
5|$|On August 31, Jimena {{encountered}} strong southerly wind shear, {{causing it}} to quickly weaken back to a tropical storm by September 1. Jimena then turned west-southwest where the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> passed 105miles (165km) south of Hawaii at 1500 UTC. Jimena continued to weaken as wind shear increased and the storm weakened to a tropical depression on September 3. After weakening back to a depression, Jimena crossed the International Date Line on September 5 at 0600 UTC, where it became the first storm to exist in all three Pacific basins since 1999's Hurricane Dora. However, Jimena was only tracked briefly by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, since strong wind shear resulted in the low level circulation to be exposed from the center and at 1727 UTC, the low level had nearly dissipated. At 1800 UTC, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued their final advisory on Jimena as the storm dissipated 715miles (1151km) southeast of Wake Island.|$|E
5|$|By June29, a trough, {{moving through}} the westerlies, rapidly {{approached}} <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> causing <b>the</b> newly designated Amy to turn sharply toward the east. Strong wind shear disorganized the system slightly, leading to Amy featuring subtropical characteristics.

Convection became displaced from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> circulation but <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> continued to intensify. Over the following several days, Amy tracked generally northeastward but underwent eastward jogs in response to rapidly moving troughs to the north.|$|R
50|$|Pacing northward, the {{hurricane}} gradually weakened after maximum intensity on November 6 but held its Category 5 strength for 72 consecutive hours before finally dropping to Category 4 status. Due to a gradual curve towards the northeast, {{the hurricane}} tracked near Cayman Brac on November 9; a minimum barometric pressure of 939 mbar (hPa; 27.73 inHg) was documented on the island.
