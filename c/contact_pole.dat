40|$|SummaryControlled {{presentation}} of stimuli to anesthetized [1] or awake [2] animals suggested that neurons in sensory cortices respond to elementary features [3, 4], {{but we know}} little about neuronal responses evoked by social interactions. Here we investigate processing in the barrel cortex of rats engaging in social facial touch [5, 6]. Sensory stimulation by conspecifics differs from classic whisker stimuli such as deflections, <b>contact</b> <b>poles</b> [7, 8], or textures [9, 10]. A large fraction of barrel cortex neurons responded to facial touch. Social touch responses peaked when animals aligned their faces and contacted each other by multiple whiskers with small, irregular whisker movements. Object touch was associated with larger, more regular whisker movements, and object responses were weaker than social responses. Whisker trimming abolished responses. During social touch, neurons in males increased their firing on average by 44 %, while neurons in females increased their firing by only 19 %. In females, socially evoked and ongoing firing rates were more than 1. 5 -fold higher in nonestrus than in estrus. Barrel cortex represented socially different contacts by distinct firing rates, and the variation of activity with sex and sexual status could contribute to the generation of gender-specific neural constructs of conspecifics...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. and can be found at: [URL] sound broadcast systems have been used to address a variety of ecological questions, and show great potential as a management tool. Such systems need to be reliable because treatments are often applied {{in the absence of a}} human observer and system failure can cause methodological ambiguity. During the breeding seasons of 2012 and 2013, we used a sound broadcast system previously described by Farrell and Campomizzi (2011) in an experiment evaluating the use of post-breeding song in forest-bird habitat selection in southern Indiana, USA. This system incorporates a portable compact disc (CD) player where the play button is permanently depressed using manual compression so that when a timer connects an electrical current to the unit, the CD player automatically starts. Despite exhaustive efforts to find a reliable way to manually compress the play button on numerous CD player models, play button failure was the most significant source of broadcast system failure (88 %) in 2012. We attempted to resolve this problem in 2013 by removing the need for manual compression and soldering the play button <b>contact</b> <b>poles</b> on each CD players' integrated circuit boards. Though we did experience broadcast system failures during < 5 % of treatment periods in 2013, none of those were attributable to play button failure. By removing all possibility of failure from manual play button compression we improved our system reliability. Thus, soldering the CD player play button on such broadcast systems represents a methodological improvement that can be used by researchers and managers interested in sound broadcast...|$|R

Further academic harassment, such as the introduction of ghetto benches, which forced Jewish students to sit in sections of the lecture halls reserved exclusively for them, anti-Jewish riots, and semi-official or unofficial quotas (Numerus clausus) introduced in 1937 in some universities, halved the number of Jews in Polish universities between independence (1918) and the late 1930s. The restrictions were so inclusive that – while the Jews made up 20.4% of the student body in 1928 – by 1937 their share was down to only 7.5%, out of the total population of 9.75% Jews in the country according to 1931 census.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study brain biomechanics between contact and non-contact head impact during vehicle crash tests in head kinematics, global brain injury metrics, and region brain strain. Nine array accelerometer package data from dummy head were extracted from 13 lateral and 14 rigid pole crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Head accelerations, HIC values and their duration were computed. Cumulative strain damage measure 15 % (CSDM), dilatational damage measure (DDM), and relative motion damage measure (RMDM) were studied using SIMon finite element head model (FEHM). Averaged regional brain strains were conducted by grouping brain element in SIMon FEHM into frontal, parietal, occipital, cerebellum, fronix and brain stem region. Head contact occurred in two lateral and six rigid <b>pole</b> tests. Head <b>contact</b> durations were less than one millisecond in rigid pole tests and ranged from 3 - 7 ms in lateral impact tests. The ratio of biomechanical measurements between contact and non-contact cases in lateral tests were: translational acceleration 4 x, rotational acceleration 3. 5 x, HIC 12 x, and CSDM 5 x, regional brain 1. 5 x. The ratios were higher for rigid pole tests: translational acceleration 14 x, rotational acceleration 25. 7 x, HIC 29. 5 x, CSDM 12 x, regional brain strain 1. 5 - 3 x. Head accelerations, HIC values, DDM and RMDM increased with increasing rotational accelerations. They were the lowest in non-head <b>contact</b> rigid <b>pole</b> tests, followed by non-contact lateral impact tests, contact lateral impact tests, and the highest in head <b>contact</b> rigid <b>pole</b> tests. However, CSDM values were higher in lateral tests than rigid pole tests for head contact cases, indicating a higher chance of diffused axonal injury in head contact lateral impact tests. On the other hand, averaged brain strain in cerebellum increased 3 x for contact cases, indicating high probability of injury to this region during this model of impact...|$|R

This magnet is composed of about 450 bar magnets, each fifteen inches long, one inch wide, and half an inch thick, arranged in a box so as to present at one of its extremities two external poles (fig. 5.). These poles projected horizontally six inches from the box, were each twelve inches high and three inches wide.

40|$|Magnetic {{suspensions}} (MS) {{satisfy the}} long life and low loss conditions demanded by satellite and ISS based flywheels used for Energy Storage and Attitude Control (ACESE) service. This paper summarizes {{the development of}} a novel MS that improves reliability via fault tolerant operation. Specifically, flux coupling between poles of a homopolar magnetic bearing is shown to deliver desired forces even after termination of coil currents to a subset of failed poles. Linear, coordinate decoupled force-voltage relations are also maintained before and after failure by bias linearization. Current distribution matrices (CDM) which adjust the currents and fluxes following a pole set failure are determined for many faulted pole combinations. The CDM s and the system responses are obtained utilizing 1 D magnetic circuit models with fringe and leakage factors derived from detailed, 3 D, finite element field models. Reliability results are presented vs. detection/correction delay time and individual power amplifier reliability for 4, 6, and 7 pole configurations. Reliability is shown for two success criteria, i. e. (a) no catcher bearing <b>contact</b> following <b>pole</b> failures and (b) re-levitation off of the catcher bearings following pole failures. An advantage of the method presented over other redundant operation approaches is a significantly reduced requirement for backup hardware such as additional actuators or power amplifiers...|$|R

Second, a test should be launched to measure the time delay between the auxiliary <b>contact</b> and main <b>pole</b> of the circuit-breaker. If the time delay is greater than 30  ms, the “close command” signal should be wired.
