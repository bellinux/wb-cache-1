We will review the basics of <b>contracting</b> <b>for</b> <b>services,</b> including what you need to receive from your end users and suppliers prior to formalizing a contract. Some of the important elements include the detailed scope of work (SOW), the contract terms and conditions, and the process for finding a supplier. The development of a clear, concise and effective scope of work is essential to ensure that the supplier understands the requirements of the service request. This understanding will lead to superior supplier performance and overall success. Basic Concepts: • Understanding the basic components necessary for services contracts • Knowing the right questions to ask your internal end users as well as your suppliers • Reviewing the need for a scope of work • The components of a scope of work • The items that should and should not be included in a scope of work • How the items included in the scope of work can enhance or diminish supplie...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. SeveralapproachestosemanticWebservices,includingOWL-S, SWSF, and WSMO, {{have been}} {{proposed}} in the literature with the aim to enable automation of various tasks related to Web services, including discovery, contracting, enactment, monitoring, and mediation. The ability to specify processes and to reason about them is central to these initiatives. In this paper we analyze the WSMO choreography model, {{which is based on}} Abstract State Machines (ASMs), and propose a methodology for generating WSMO choreography from visual specifications. We point out the limitations of the current WSMO model and propose a faithful extension that is based on Concurrent Transaction Logic (CTR). The advantage of a CTR-based model is that it uniformly captures a number of aspects that previously required separate mechanisms or were not captured at all. These include process specification, <b>contracting</b> <b>for</b> <b>services,</b> service enactment, and reasoning. ...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades governments have {{increasingly}} contracted-out the provision of public and human services to outside organisations. These contracts were not designed to regulate the wages and other working conditions of the workers employed by the external organisation. There is increasing evidence that <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>services</b> are being used as a tool to regulate labour standards for workers, usurping the labour law provisions covering these workers’ labour standards. The central objective of this thesis is to analyse how labour standards are regulated through the combination of labour law and <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>services</b> when services are contracted-out. This is achieved with a case study of NSW government school cleaning contracts. These are amongst the largest <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>services</b> in the world, with more than 6, 000 employees providing cleaning services. The case study reveals that government <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>services</b> have taken a predominant role in how labour standards are negotiated, defined, monitored and enforced, while the employment contract underpinning labour law takes a secondary regulatory role. In practice, the cleaners’ labour standards are poorly monitored and rarely enforced with minimal compliance with standards prescribed by labour law or by the <b>contracts</b> <b>for</b> <b>services.</b> The findings of the analysis are significant for three reasons. First, there is a dearth of research to date that considers how labour is regulated through the combination of labour law and procurement contracts. This is particularly important given the prevalence of procurement in the public services arena. Second, the thesis expands understandings of how labour standards for cleaners, as a subset of vulnerable workers, are regulated. This is significant if contracting-out is used as a strategy to undermine labour standards for the most vulnerable workers. Third, the analysis highlights the problems of labour law becoming subservient to contracts in regulating labour standards...|$|R

The research explores how often and how effectively these two concepts are used together in the Navy.

Question # 2 : Why does the Navy attempt to use PBA techniques for LOE contracts? Question # 3 : What are the consequences of using PBA techniques for LOE contracts? An analysis of 50 contracts for services revealed that the Navy ineffectively applies PBA techniques to LOE contracts. A review of policy and regulations demonstrated that PBA and LOE are fundamentally incompatible contracting approaches. The study suggests possible explanations for why the Navy attempts to combine PBA and LOE and explores the consequences of doing so. This paper recommends that acquisition policy-makers at all levels make clear that PBA and LOE are dichotomous choices. Civilian, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Pacifi...|$|E

This growth in dollars spent has brought increased political attention and scrutiny. DoD has responded to problems such as contract mismanagement and ill-defined requirements by improving service acquisitions, but it still has problems. The problems could be {{from a lack of}} standard definition for success. Since contract success and failure is recorded through the Contract Past Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) this information is used for the proxy definition for success. This definition was used to address the following questions: (1) Do the types of services being acquired affect the success of a service contract, (2) Do the contractual amounts affect the success of a service contract, (3) Does the level of competition used affect the success of a service contract, (4) Does the contract type affect the success of a services contract. This report examined 715 CPARS entries. The findings revealed that contractual amounts and level of competition affect the success of a service contract. The findings also revealed that the failure rate in CPARS is lower than expected. From these findings, the report presents a discussion of the results and managerial implications, and recommends an alternate method in completing CPARS data.

There was little accommodation by the agencies that were creating these new suburbs for the wellbeing of new residents. Apart from schools and churches, few facilities existed and my time was spent within the community setting up new services and facilities. Local authorities in metropolitan areas were particularly concerned {{at the rate of}} change due to rural-to-urban migration exacerbating problems like housing, social service accessibility and unemployment.

The 1970 s and 80 s was a period of innovation, with the creation of new community development models such as Community Volunteers Inc. and community schools. Change came in the mid- 1980 s with neo-liberal policies, local authority restructuring and the shifting of power from elected councillors (key supporters of community development) to management.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{approaches of}} district health authorities to quality in contracting. DESIGN: Descriptive survey. SETTING: All district health authorities in one health region of England in a National Health Service accounting year. MATERIAL: 129 quality specifications used in <b>contracting</b> <b>for</b> <b>services</b> in six specialties (eight general quality specifications and 121 service specific quality specifications) MAIN MEASURES: Evaluation {{of the use}} of quality specifications; their scope and content in relation to established criteria of healthcare quality. RESULTS: Most district health authorities developed quality specifications which would be applicable to their local hospital. When purchasing care outside their boundaries they adopted the quality specifications developed by other health authorities. The service specific quality specifications were more limited in scope than the general quality specifications. The quality of clinical care was referred to in 75 % of general and 43 % of service specific quality specifications. Both types of specification considered quality issues in superficial and broad terms only. Established features of quality improvement were rarely included. Prerequisites to ensure provider accountability and satisfactory delivery of service specifications were not routinely included in contracts. CONCLUSION: Quality specifications within service contracts are commonly used by health authorities. This study shows that their use of this approach to quality improvement is inconsistent and unlikely to achieve desired quality goals. Continued reliance on the current approach is holding back a more fundamental debate on how to create effective management of quality improvement through the interaction between purchasers and providers of health care...|$|E
