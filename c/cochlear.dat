5|$|Hearing aids or <b>cochlear</b> {{implants}} {{may be used}} if {{the hearing}} loss is severe or prolonged. Hearing aids work by amplifying {{the sound of the}} local environment and are best suited to conductive hearing loss. <b>Cochlear</b> implants transmit the sound that is heard {{as if it were a}} nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>cochlear</b> duct’s mesenchyme {{begins to}} differentiate, three {{cavities}} are formed: the scala vestibuli, the scala tympani and the scala media. Both the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani contain an extracellular fluid called perilymph. The scala media contains endolymph. A set of membranes called the vestibular membrane and the basilar membrane develop {{to separate the}} <b>cochlear</b> duct from the vestibular duct and the tympanic duct, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{vestibulocochlear nerve}} (VIII) splits into the {{vestibular}} and <b>cochlear</b> nerve. The vestibular part {{is responsible for}} innervating the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear; this structure transmits information about balance, and {{is an important component}} of the vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The <b>cochlear</b> nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing sound to be heard.|$|E
5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of the embryo, they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals. Closer to the front of the embryo, the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the <b>cochlear</b> duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the <b>cochlear</b> nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, the medial geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
5|$|On 3 January 2013, Yousafzai was {{discharged}} from the hospital to continue her rehabilitation at her family's temporary home in the West Midlands. She underwent a five-hour long operation on 2 February to reconstruct her skull and restore her hearing with a <b>cochlear</b> implant, after which she {{was reported to be}} in stable condition.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. Sensorineural hearing loss in humans {{may be caused by}} a loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with hearing). This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, hearing aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a <b>cochlear</b> implant.|$|E
5|$|The bony {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} the bony compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, contained within the temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the <b>cochlear</b> duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} ear has specific {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equaliser between the outside air's low impedance and the <b>cochlear</b> fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, porpoises receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The porpoise ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The large bulge {{on top of the}} porpoises head is caused by the melon.|$|E
5|$|The whale ear has {{specific}} {{adaptations to}} the marine environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the <b>cochlear</b> fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge {{sitting on top of}} its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.|$|E
5|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} a cerebellum {{and one or}} more cerebellum-like structures, brain areas that resemble the cerebellum in terms of cytoarchitecture and neurochemistry. The only cerebellum-like structure found in mammals is the dorsal <b>cochlear</b> nucleus (DCN), {{one of the two}} primary sensory nuclei that receive input directly from the auditory nerve. The DCN is a layered structure, with the bottom layer containing granule cells {{similar to those of the}} cerebellum, giving rise to parallel fibers that rise to the superficial layer and travel across it horizontally. The superficial layer contains a set of GABAergic neurons called cartwheel cells that resemble Purkinje cells anatomically and chemically—they receive parallel fiber input, but do not have any inputs that resemble climbing fibers. The output neurons of the DCN are pyramidal cells. They are glutamatergic, but also resemble Purkinje cells in some respects—they have spiny, flattened superficial dendritic trees that receive parallel fiber input, but they also have basal dendrites that receive input from auditory nerve fibers, which travel across the DCN in a direction at right angles to the parallel fibers. The DCN is most highly developed in rodents and other small animals, and is considerably reduced in primates. Its function is not well understood; the most popular speculations relate it to spatial hearing in one way or another.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the <b>cochlear</b> fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the fifth}} week of development, the {{auditory}} vesicle also {{gives rise to the}} <b>cochlear</b> duct, which contains the spiral organ of Corti and the endolymph that accumulates in the membranous labyrinth. The vestibular wall will separate the <b>cochlear</b> duct from the perilymphatic scala vestibuli, a cavity inside the cochlea. The basilar membrane separates the <b>cochlear</b> duct from the scala tympani, a cavity within the <b>cochlear</b> labyrinth. The lateral wall of the <b>cochlear</b> duct is formed by the spiral ligament and the stria vascularis, which produces the endolymph. The hair cells develop from the lateral and medial ridges of the <b>cochlear</b> duct, which together with the tectorial membrane make up the organ of Corti.|$|E

25|$|There is {{controversy}} {{around the}} devices; {{much of the}} strongest objection to <b>cochlear</b> implants {{has come from the}} Deaf community. For some in the deaf community, <b>cochlear</b> implants are an affront to their culture, which as some view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cochlear</b> {{implantation}} restores {{access to}} the acoustic signal in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss. The acoustic information conveyed by an implant is usually sufficient for implant users to properly recognize speech of people they know even without visual clues. For <b>cochlear</b> implant users, {{it is more difficult}} to understand unknown speakers and sounds. The perceptual abilities of children that received an implant after the age of two are significantly better than of those who were implanted in adulthood. A number of factors have been shown to influence perceptual performance, specifically: duration of deafness prior to implantation, age of onset of deafness, age at implantation (such age effects {{may be related to the}} Critical period hypothesis) and the duration of using an implant. There are differences between children with congenital and acquired deafness. Postlingually deaf children have better results than the prelingually deaf and adapt to a <b>cochlear</b> implant faster. In both children with <b>cochlear</b> implants and normal hearing, vowels and voice onset time becomes prevalent in development before the ability to discriminate the place of articulation. Several months following implantation, children with <b>cochlear</b> implants can normalize speech perception.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} {{auditory}} neuropathy obtain <b>cochlear</b> implants, also with mixed success.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cochlear</b> {{implants}} {{are only}} approved {{for people who}} are deaf in both ears; as of 2014 a <b>cochlear</b> implant had been used experimentally in some people who had acquired deafness in one ear after they had learned how to speak, and none who were deaf in one ear from birth; clinical studies as of 2014 had been too small to draw generalizations from.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cochlear</b> {{implants}} bypass most of {{the peripheral}} auditory system which receives sound and converts that sound into movements of hair cells in the cochlea; the inside-portion of these hair cells release potassium ions {{in response to the}} movement of the hairs, and the potassium in turn stimulates other cells to release the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which makes the <b>cochlear</b> nerve send signals to the brain, which creates the experience of sound. Instead, the devices pick up sound and digitize it, convert that digitized sound into electrical signals, and transmit those signals to electrodes embedded in the cochlea. The electrodes electrically stimulate the <b>cochlear</b> nerve, causing it to send signals to the brain.|$|E
25|$|Two main brands {{manufacture}} BAHAs today – {{the original}} inventors <b>Cochlear,</b> and {{the hearing aid}} company Oticon.|$|E
25|$|Auditory {{neuropathy}} {{is diagnosed}} {{when a person}} has present otoacoustic emissions and/or <b>cochlear</b> microphonics in combination with absent or abnormal auditory brainstem response. Changing the polarity of the stimulus will result in an inversion of the <b>cochlear</b> microphonic. Patients with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorders have to date never {{been shown to have}} normal middle ear muscle reflexes at 95 dB HL or less despite having normal otoacoustic emissions.|$|E
25|$|Hearing loss {{may have}} many {{different}} causes; but among tinnitus subjects, the major cause is <b>cochlear</b> damage.|$|E
25|$|The lateral lemniscus {{is located}} where the <b>cochlear</b> nuclei and the pontine reticular {{formation}} (PRF) crossover. The PRF descends the reticulospinal tract where it innervates motor neurons and spinal interneurons. It {{is the main}} auditory tract in the brainstem that connects the superior olivary complex (SOC) with the inferior colliculus (IC). The dorsal <b>cochlear</b> nucleus (DCN) has input from the LL and output to the contralateral LL via the ipsilateral and contralateral Dorsal Acoustic Stria.|$|E
25|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} involving hard of hearing individuals as well as individuals that have had <b>cochlear</b> implants. These individuals tend to weigh visual information from speech more heavily than auditory information. In comparison to normal hearing individuals, this is not different unless {{there is more than}} one syllable, such as a word. Regarding the McGurk experiment, responses from <b>cochlear</b> implanted users produced the same responses as normal hearing individuals when an auditory bilabial stimulus is dubbed onto a visual velar stimulus. However, when an auditory dental stimulus is dubbed onto a visual bilabial stimulus, the responses are quite different. The McGurk effect is still present in individuals with impaired hearing or using <b>cochlear</b> implants, although it is quite different in some aspects.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the strongest}} {{objection}} to <b>cochlear</b> implants has come from within the Deaf community, {{some of whom are}} pre-lingually deaf people whose first language is a sign language. For some in the Deaf community, <b>cochlear</b> implants are an affront to their culture, which, as they view it, is a minority threatened by the hearing majority. This is an old problem for the deaf community, going back as far as the 18th century with the argument of manualism vs. oralism. This is consistent with medicalisation and the standardisation of the 'normal' body in the 19th century, when differences between normal and abnormal began to be debated. It is important to consider the sociocultural context, particularly in regards to the Deaf community, which considers itself to possess its own unique language and culture. This accounts for the <b>cochlear</b> implant being seen as an affront to their culture, as many do not believe that deafness is {{something that needs to be}} cured. However, it has also been argued that this does not necessarily have to be the case: the <b>cochlear</b> implant can act as a tool Deaf people can use to access the 'hearing world' without losing their Deaf identity.|$|E
25|$|As of December 2012, {{approximately}} 324,000 <b>cochlear</b> implant devices {{had been}} surgically implanted. In the U.S., roughly 58,000 devices were implanted in adults and 38,000 in children.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the FCC adopted {{rules to}} make digital {{wireless}} telephones compatible with hearing aids and <b>cochlear</b> implants. Although analog wireless phones do not usually cause interference with hearing aids or <b>cochlear</b> implants, digital wireless phones often do because of electromagnetic energy emitted by the phone's antenna, backlight, or other components. The FCC {{has set a}} timetable for the development and sale of digital wireless telephones that are compatible with hearing aids. This effort promises {{to increase the number}} of digital wireless telephones that are hearing aid-compatible.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the overall}} cost of getting <b>cochlear</b> {{implants}} was about $100,000 as of 2017. Some or all of this may be covered by health insurance. In the United Kingdom, the NHS covers <b>cochlear</b> implants in full, as does Medicare in Australia, and the Department of Health in Ireland, Seguridad Social in Spain and Israel, and the Ministry of Health or ACC (depending on the cause of deafness) in New Zealand. According to the US National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, the estimated total cost is $60,000 per person implanted.|$|E
25|$|The nucleus geniculatus {{medialis}} receives axons from auditory axons. From the cochlea, peripheral auditory information {{goes to the}} <b>cochlear</b> nucleus. From there, {{through the}} <b>cochlear</b> nerve, axons reach the superior olivary complex of both sides. Axons from there constitute the lateral lemniscus which ends in the inferior colliculus. Axons from the inferior colliculus constitute the brachium of the inferior colliculus and end in the medial geniculate. The thalamocortical axons from the medial geniculate nucleus end in the primary auditory cortex located {{in the center of}} the superior temporal plane. See auditory system.|$|E
25|$|The perilymph in the {{vestibular}} duct and the endolymph in the <b>cochlear</b> duct act mechanically as {{a single}} duct, being kept apart only by the very thin Reissner's membrane.|$|E
25|$|Some {{examples}} include pacemakers, infusion pumps, the heart-lung machine, dialysis machines, artificial organs, implants, artificial limbs, corrective lenses, <b>cochlear</b> implants, ocular prosthetics, facial prosthetics, somato prosthetics, and dental implants.|$|E
25|$|Auditory canal {{decompression}} {{is another}} surgical technique that can prolong usable hearing when a vestibular schwannoma has grown {{too large to}} remove without damage to the <b>cochlear</b> nerve. In the IAC (internal auditory canal) decompression, a middle fossa approach is employed to expose the bony roof of the IAC without any attempt to remove the tumor. The bone overlying the acoustic nerve is removed, allowing the tumour to expand upward into the middle cranial fossa. In this way, pressure on the <b>cochlear</b> nerve is relieved, {{reducing the risk of}} further hearing loss from direct compression or obstruction of vascular supply to the nerve.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{possible}} after a test battery, that must necessarily include the following: the auditory brainstem response and otoacoustic emissions. Auditory brainstem response {{should be tested}} with both polarities (helps in identifying <b>cochlear</b> microphonics).|$|E
25|$|As of 2013, {{the three}} <b>cochlear</b> implant devices {{approved}} {{for use in}} the U.S. were manufactured by <b>Cochlear</b> Limited (Australia), Advanced Bionics (USA, a division of Sonova) and MED-EL (Austria). In Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and Canada, an additional device manufactured by Neurelec (France, a division of William Demant) was available. A device made by Nurotron (China) was also available {{in some parts of the}} world. Each manufacturer has adapted some of the successful innovations of the other companies to its own devices. There is no consensus that any one of these implants is superior to the others. Users of all devices report a wide range of performance after implantation.|$|E
25|$|The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium (AAO HNS CHE) set {{criteria}} for diagnosing Ménière's, {{as well as}} defining two sub categories of Ménière's: <b>cochlear</b> (without vertigo) and vestibular (without deafness).|$|E
25|$|The modern {{multichannel}} <b>cochlear</b> implant was independently {{developed and}} commercialized by Graeme Clark from Australia and Ingeborg Hochmair and her future husband, Erwin Hochmair, with the Hochmairs' first implanted {{in a person}} in December 1977 and Clark's in August 1978.|$|E
