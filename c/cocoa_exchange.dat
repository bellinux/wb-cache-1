However, the national cocoa facing various problems, especially the quality is still low. PTPN VIII Cikumpay Afdeling Rajamandala is national plantation that produces cocoa with quality in national standards, so the objectives {{of this study are}} to analyze competitiveness of cocoa in PTPN VIII Cikumpay Rajamandala, to analyze government policy effect, to analyze the changing effect of productivity, price of <b>cocoa,</b> and <b>exchange</b> rates of rupiah against competitiveness of the cocoa. The methods of this research are Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM) and sensitivity analysis. The results suggest that cocoa from PTPN VIII Rajamandala have competitiveness because the value of Private Cost Ratio (0. 92) and Domestic Resource Cost (0. 95) less than one and the value of private and social benefits are positive. The value of NPCO (Nominal Protection Coefficient Output) indicates that government policy is support competitiveness of cocoa, but the value of NPCI (Nominal Protection Coefficient on Inputs) shows that government policy is not support competitiveness of cocoa. Sensitivity analysis indicates that productivity, the price of <b>cocoa,</b> and <b>exchange</b> rate of rupiah affect the competitiveness of cocoa in PTPN VIII Cikumpay Rajamandala. Therefore, to increase productivity and to anticipate price and currency fluctuations in world markets, there should be serious steps such as the role of the government by issuing policies that protect domestic producers so the Indonesian cocoa more competitive...|$|R
25|$|The {{widespread}} use of children in cocoa production is controversial, {{not only for the}} concerns about child labor and exploitation, but also because up to 12,000 of the 200,000 children working in Côte d'Ivoire, the world's biggest producer of cocoa, may be victims of trafficking or slavery. Most attention on this subject has focused on West Africa, which collectively supplies 69 percent of the world's cocoa, and Côte d'Ivoire in particular, which supplies 35 percent of the world's cocoa. Thirty percent of children under age 15 in sub-Saharan Africa are child laborers, mostly in agricultural activities including cocoa farming.

5000|$|For {{the next}} forty years, from 1939 until 1979, the New York <b>Cocoa</b> <b>Exchange</b> {{was one of}} the primary tenants in the Beaver Building, with the trading room on the first story and mezzanine. The <b>Cocoa</b> <b>Exchange</b> was {{established}} in New York in 1925 (at 124 Water Street), by cocoa users seeking to eliminate risk due to price fluctuations, as the world's first cocoa futures market. As the production and consumption of cocoa and chocolate products expanded rapidly in the twentieth century and cocoa developed as a leading international commodity, the United States emerged as the world's largest cocoa consumer. When the <b>Cocoa</b> <b>Exchange</b> moved into the Beaver Building in April 1931, the New York Times noted that [...] "the Exchange has grown to be the largest market {{of its kind in the}} world, and transactions on its floor usually equal and frequently have exceeded the world's crop of cocoa." [...] Many of the other commodities exchanges were also located in the immediate vicinity of Beaver and Broad Streets at this time. The Beaver Building additionally housed a number of commercial tenants and organizations associated with the cocoa industry over the years, including the New York Cocoa Clearing Association and Cocoa Merchants Association of America. The <b>Cocoa</b> <b>Exchange</b> moved from the Beaver Building to new quarters (127 John Street) in 1972; it merged with the New York Coffee & Sugar Exchange to form the Coffee, Sugar & <b>Cocoa</b> <b>Exchange</b> in 1979.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the evolution, throughout the harvest season, of merchantability criteria and Ochratoxin A (OTA) levels in cocoa beans produced in Cote d'Ivoire. To this end, 567 samples of cocoa beans, collected in 6 production areas during the 2007 - 2008 season, were analyzed. Merchantability and OTA levels were determined respectively according to the Ivorian Coffee and <b>Cocoa</b> stock <b>exchange</b> standards and the European Community regulation related to the analytical methods for the control of mycotoxins levels in foodstuffs (EC 401 / 2006). Concerning merchantability, a significant difference at 5 % risk was revealed between the values of moisture, graining and grades. As regards OTA levels, the concentrations obtained ranged from 0. 41 µg/kg to 1. 36 µg/kg of cocoa beans with an average concentration of 0. 69 µg/kg. These concentrations are all below the maximum value set at 2 µg/kg by the European Commission. Moldy and/or slaty beans are chiefly answerable for the depreciation of cocoa beans marketability. These results served to devise a map summarizing the quality of Ivorian cocoa beans. Needless to say, this map is just a representation of a situation at a given time, and should therefore contribute to take up decisions relevant to the application of good production and postharvest processing practices in the country’s quest for cocoa beans of prime quality. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of agroclimatic factors on the yield of cash crops in Nigeria and other variables such as producer prices, exchange rate and level of national income (GDP). The effects of total rainfall, mean temperature, sunshine hour, relative humidity, radiation, exchange rate and GDP on the yields of three cash crops (Cocoa, Palm Kernel and Palm Oil) were estimated for the period 1970 - 2003 in Nigeria. The methods of analysis employed in the study were mainly error-correction model (ECM) within the context of co-integration theory. The results showed that all the variables are not stationary at their levels and thus, a need for differencing once to attain stationary. Statistical significance of the error-correction terms for the three produce validates the existence of an equilibrium relationship among the variables in each of these co-integrating vectors.

40|$|One of the {{development}} strategies utilized by the agriculture sector is to encourage crop diversification with the aim to increase national income. Cocoa cultivation has a good potential to be an industrial crop which can be further developed. Considering cocoa cultivation is the third important crop after rubber and oil palm, it is pertinent that a dried cocoa price determinant study be conducted. Several {{studies show that the}} economic factors may give impact to the price of dried cocoa beans in Malaysia. This study will assess {{the extent to which the}} economic factors may affect the price of dried cocoa price. The objective or purpose of the study is to identify the impact of economic factors to the dried cocoa price. To analyze the effects of economic factors towards the dried cocoa price changes, this study consists of three independent variables which are Food Consumer Price Index (FCPI), export volume of <b>cocoa</b> beans and <b>exchange</b> rate using UK Pound Sterling while the dependent variable is the price of dried cocoa beans.

5000|$|The {{origins of}} {{clearing}} houses {{dates back to}} the late 19th century, when they were primarily used to net payments in commodities futures markets. CCPs are financial market infrastructures that can reduce and [...] "mutualize" [...] (share among their members) counterparty credit risk in the markets in which they operate.The use of clearing houses by financial exchanges is somewhat more novel. Financial exchanges only first began to use clearing houses {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century. As late as 1899, the London Stock Exchange was still the only stock exchange in Europe using a clearing house. The first stock exchange in the United States, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (founded 1790), was also the trend setter that was the first U.S. stock exchange to use a clearing system. It began using a clearing system in 1870, but the much larger New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) still had no clearing system some two decades later in 1891. The Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York (Consolidated) used clearing houses from its inception in 1885. This exchange existed in competition with the NYSE from 1885-1926 and averaged 23% of NYSE volume. Its competitor Consolidated's use of clearing houses, finally forced the NYSE to follow suit (from 1892) to gain the same market advantages of at least prevention of frauds and reneging on bargains. Some major U.S. commodities exchanges, like the New York Coffee Exchange (today the Coffee, Sugar and <b>Cocoa</b> <b>Exchange)</b> and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange did not begin using clearing houses to settle their transactions until the second decade of the 20th century. The New York Coffee Exchange began using clearing houses in 1914. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange began using them even later in 1919.|$|E
