5|$|A {{person can}} obtain more {{or all of}} the {{categories}} at once. But the set of categories needs to be known before the exam and highest score needs to be met. Typically, people obtain E and B category because these two categories provides the best versatility (almost any firearm can be owned and carried concealed). The D <b>category</b> <b>is</b> required by the law for the members of the municipal police (members of the state police do not need license for on duty firearms) and does not itself permit private gun ownership (unless the person obtains also other license category).|$|E
50|$|The Under-19 boys <b>category</b> <b>was</b> {{known as}} the Drysdale Cup before 1999; the Under-16 and Under-14 <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> both held prior to 1999, until being {{replaced}} by Under-15 and Under-17 categories respectively.

Smith also lost in the young British classical performer category to Jack Liebeck, a violinist. Smith became the youngest artist ever to receive a double nomination. In November, Smith was awarded the best classical award at the 2009 Variety Club awards, the youngest ever recipient in the awards' 57-year history.|$|E

5|$|Jo-ha-kyū is {{incorporated}} in traditional five-play program of Noh. The first play is jo, the second, third, and fourth plays are ha, and the fifth play is kyū. In fact, the five categories discussed below were created so that the program would represent jo-ha-kyū when one play from each <b>category</b> <b>is</b> selected and performed in order. Each play can be broken into three parts, the introduction, the development, and the conclusion. A play starts out in a slow tempo at jo, gets slightly faster at ha, then culminates in kyū.|$|E
5|$|Much {{is written}} about the {{different}} factors that threaten the painted turtle, but they are unquantified, with only inferences of relative importance. A primary threat <b>category</b> <b>is</b> habitat loss in various forms. Related to water habitat, there is drying of wetlands, clearing of aquatic logs or rocks (basking sites), and clearing of shoreline vegetation, which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic. Related to nesting habitat, urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} removal of some <b>categories</b> new <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> {{introduced}} in Television and Music Categories. In Television following <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> introduced: ...|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> defined {{independently}} of the set of alternatives under consideration. In that regard, MCPs are based on an absolute evaluation scheme. For instance, a predefined specific set of <b>categories</b> <b>is</b> often used to classify industrial accidents (e.g., major, minor, etc.). These <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> not related to a specific event under consideration. Of course, {{in many cases the}} definition of the <b>categories</b> <b>is</b> adjusted over time to take into consideration the changes in the decision environment.|$|R

5|$|Since 1949, a more {{detailed}} classification system has been put into use based on thematic content and the historical period of a play's creation. The first category in this system is chuantongxi, traditional plays that were in performance before 1949. The second <b>category</b> <b>is</b> xinbian de lishixi, historical plays written after 1949. This type of play was not produced at all during the Cultural Revolution, but is a major focus today. The final <b>category</b> <b>is</b> xiandaixi, contemporary plays. The subject matter of these plays is taken from the 20th century and beyond. Contemporary productions are also frequently experimental in nature, and may incorporate Western influences. In {{the second half of}} the 20th century, Western works have increasingly been adapted for Peking opera. The works of Shakespeare have been especially popular. The movement to adapt Shakespeare to the stage has encompassed all forms of Chinese theatre. Peking opera in particular has seen versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream and King Lear, among others.|$|E
5|$|Since their {{inception}} in 1989, awards {{have been given}} in various categories in fiction and non-fiction. The category for speculative fiction works has changed several times; from science fiction and mystery, to science fiction and fantasy, and finally to LGBT Sci-Fi, fantasy and horror. This <b>category</b> <b>is</b> open to submissions {{in the form of}} novels, novellas, short stories, collections and anthologies. Initially the genre categories were also split into gay men's and lesbian categories, but were merged in 1993. This article lists all the award nominees and winners for all the variously titled science fiction categories.|$|E
5|$|The derived {{category}} of coherent sheaves is constructed using tools from complex geometry, {{a branch of}} mathematics that describes geometric curves in algebraic terms and solves geometric problems using algebraic equations. On the other hand, the Fukaya <b>category</b> <b>is</b> constructed using symplectic geometry, a branch of mathematics that arose from studies of classical physics. Symplectic geometry studies spaces equipped with a symplectic form, a mathematical tool {{that can be used}} to compute area in two-dimensional examples.|$|E

In 1928, separate <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> introduced for dramatic, epic, and lyric literature. Awards in these <b>categories</b> <b>were</b> also presented in 1948, while the drama <b>category</b> <b>was</b> dropped in 1936.|$|R
5|$|To {{begin the}} game, a <b>category</b> <b>is</b> revealed, {{and the three}} teams of three contestants are asked {{multiple}} choice questions under that category, with each question having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with the correct answer earns the respective team 100 points; an incorrect answer loses 100 points, and opens up the question to the other teams. Contestants must {{wait until after the}} host reads the entire question (including the choices) to buzz in.|$|E

Level III has a reservoir with house-to-house connections. 5,252 households were serviced by Level II water systems and 24,700 households by Level I water system. Level I <b>category</b> <b>is</b> a common facility where the community members get their water supply from deep wells and shallow wells, while Level II has a reservoir with communal faucet. Based on the report from the Provincial Health Office in 2007, a total of 48,542 households out of the 57,079 or 85.04 percent have access to safe drinking water.|$|E
5|$|The USAD {{requires}} {{a diversity of}} achievement within each team; teams must have students who fall into three categories determined by GPA. The Honors <b>category</b> <b>is</b> composed of students with GPAs between 3.75 and 4.0. The Scholastic category consists of students with GPAs between 3.0 and 3.74. The final group, the Varsity category, contains students whose GPA ranges from 0.00 to 2.99. USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance-based classes such as music, art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation. A grade counts for face value {{regardless of whether it}} is from an advanced placement, honors, regular or remedial class. An A is counted as a 4.0, a B as a 3.0, a C as a 2.0, a D as a 1.0, and a F as a 0. Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA.|$|E

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{concerning the}} relation between phoneme and syllable <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> contrasted. The phonological hypothesis holds that phoneme <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> perceptually basic, whereas syllable <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> abstract and specify the phonological rules operating on phoneme categories. The integrative routine hypothesis suggests that whereas phoneme <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> basic, syllable <b>categories</b> <b>are</b> not entirely abstract but are represented at least partially {{on the basis of}} higher order perceptual information, specifying the dynamics of coarticulating phoneme categories. Three experiments used a primed naming task in which subjects had to name the entire syllable (consonant-vowel and vowel-consonant; Experiment 1), the syllable-initial phoneme category (Experiment 2), or the syllable-final phoneme category (Experiment 3). The results supported the integrative routine hypothesis. status: publishe...|$|R
