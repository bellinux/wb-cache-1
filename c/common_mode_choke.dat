40|$|High-speed {{power line}} {{communication}} (PLC) systems {{have been developed for}} home networks. However, the transmission characteristics of an indoor AC mains line have not been clarified. We studied the influence of the appliance operation state on the transmission characteristics of the indoor AC mains line. The AC mains line and appliances were represented by four-port networks and two-port networks. The transmission characteristics were calculated by a model constructed with these networks. The two-port network parameters of the appliances were measured in both operating and stop states. The equivalent circuits were determined for both states based on the condition that the frequency characteristics of the circuits agreed with the measured value. A simple AC mains system was constructed and the transmission characteristics were measured to compare with the calculated value in various states. The results indicate that the calculated value agreed well with the measured one, and the transmission loss deviation resulting from the appliance state was within 10 dB. A <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choke</b> coil was inserted between the AC mains line and the appliances to reduce the transmission loss deviation resulting from different states.

40|$|The {{common mode}} inductors, or common mode chokes, {{are a key}} {{component}} of electromagnetic interference filters. Engineers usually face significant design challenges such as size, cost and weight while working with these components. To avoid the construction of several prototypes, often oversized, engineers need an analytical method to predict performances of the filter. The analysis of the common mode inductors starts with a presentation of the different ferromagnetic materials: their properties are the cornerstone of the design of the component. Based on this study, the impedances used to characterize the choke are related to the designable parameters. The derived model shows the role of the parasitic currents to ground and the common mode impedance in the overall common mode current attenuation. A certain attenuation of differential mode current is also to be expected due to the parasitic currents of the <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choke</b> itself: the turn to turn capacitance and the leakage inductance. This model is validated by measurements. Sensitivity studies provide an additional insight into the behavior of the choke by giving an understanding on how variations of parameters, influence the final performance.

50|$|Discrete {{component}} VIGs (pictured) {{consist of}} a stack of well-coupled <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>chokes</b> interconnected {{with a stack of}} capacitors. The inductors present a high inductance to currents that are in-phase in the two windings, and a far lower inductance when the winding currents are flowing in opposite directions. The capacitors are charged with alternating polarity and when the switch (usually a triggered or free running spark gap in practice) is closed the voltage across every second capacitor rapidly inverts as a half cycle of oscillation at a frequency set by the capacitance resonating with the differential mode inductance of the chokes. At the same time the other capacitors discharge very slowly due to not having a differential current flowing to cancel the reactance.So after a half period, all the capacitors are in series and the voltages add. This arrangement has a conceptual equivalence to the distributed component spiral VIG, with the alternating capacitors representing the two transmission lines of alternating polarity and the spiral turns representing successive stacked stages.Discrete components allow large lumped capacitors to be used thus storing much more energy, but have difficulty replicating the high voltage multiplication ratios and extremely short rise times of spiral transmission line types.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The main aim of {{the paper}} was {{investigation}} of structure and physical properties of Fe-based metallic glasses with Ni and Co addition. Design/methodology/approach: The structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, transmission electron microscope (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM). The measurement of physical properties (magnetic and mechanical) were made. The magnetic properties contained initial magnetic permeability μi, coercive force Hc and magnetic after-effects ∆μ/μ measurements were determined by the Maxwell-Wien bridge, coercivemeter and {{with the use of}} automatic device for measurements magnetic permeability, respectively. Microhardness tests were performed on Vickers microhardness tester. Findings: The XRD and TEM investigations revealed that the studied ribbons were amorphous. The SEM images showed that studied fractures morphology of ribbons is changing from smooth fracture inside with narrow dense veins pattern on surface having contact with the copper roller during casting to fine (shell) chevron pattern on surface freely solidified. The changing of chosen soft magnetic and mechanical properties obtained for samples with different thickness {{is a result of the}} non-homogenous amorphous structure of tested metallic glasses.

40|$|The thesis {{considers}} {{design and}} manufacturing of ferrite based {{high frequency power}} transformers. The primary aim of the work was to study core and winding losses and in particular thermal modeling of high frequency power transformers and to determine appropriate loss and temperature rise modeling methods for power converter applications. The secondary aim of the work was to study improved, mass manufacturable winding methods for toroidal, tube-type planar and disc-type planar high frequency power transformers. The analytical high frequency power transformer design equations for core and winding losses and transformer temperature rise were reviewed from literature, formulated for spreadsheet type calculations using excitation, material, geometry and winding implementation parameters and validated by in circuit temperature rise comparisons between calculated and measured values using regression analysis. The core and winding loss calculation methods in literature were found to provide appropriate accuracy for the practical design purposes. Thermal test block tests suggested a slight modification for analytical convective heat transfer equation from the literature. The results from in circuit temperature rise comparisons suggest that the transformer total losses can be predicted with the average standard error below 0. 2  W with datasheet type information only. Further, if conductive thermal resistance from transformer via printed circuit board substrate to ambient is available the transformer operating temperature could be predicted with appropriate accuracy (5. 6 °C) as well. The new manufacturing methods developed for toroidal, tube and disc-type transformer geometries were proved to be suitable for high frequency operation. With a <b>common</b> <b>mode</b> <b>choke</b> with static shield and windings deposited and etched directly on the toroidal NiZn core a transfer loss resonant frequency above 1. 2  GHz was achieved. A multilayer foil winding with interleaved primary and secondary layers resulted resulted leakage inductance of 10  % of the value achieved using a wire-wound winding. The new developments for Z-folded inductive components resulted material cost savings, reduction of winding resistance and adjustability of leakage inductance and winding capacitances. reviewe...|$|E

In this paper, radiated emission measurements in a 3 -meter semi-anechoic chamber for two cases of a printed circuit board design without EMC consideration and the second is circuit design with EMC best practices. The results show that the emission level is higher than the product standard limits due to the radiation from the circuit board itself and the interfacing cable. The level can be minimized by keeping the areas of power or signal and its return path loops smaller and the use of a short cable.
