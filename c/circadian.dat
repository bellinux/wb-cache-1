5|$|The {{predictive}} or <b>circadian</b> system increases renal secretion {{of potassium}} during mealtime hours (e.g. daytime for humans, nighttime for rodents) {{independent of the}} presence, amount, or absence of potassium ingestion. It is mediated by a <b>circadian</b> oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain (central clock), which causes the kidney (peripheral clock) to secrete potassium in this rhythmic <b>circadian</b> fashion.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the <b>circadian</b> rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The <b>circadian</b> rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour <b>circadian</b> clock. In the <b>circadian</b> day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E
5|$|There are <b>circadian</b> {{variations}} in CSF secretion, with the mechanisms not fully understood, but potentially relating {{to differences in}} the activation of the autonomic nervous system {{over the course of}} the day.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{forebrain}} to the midbrain is the diencephalon (in the diagram, {{this structure}} {{is below the}} optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. The pineal body lies just above the diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains <b>circadian</b> rhythms, and controls color changes.|$|E
5|$|Daily rhythms {{may also}} be {{regulated}} by {{a complex set of}} hormonal controls of which only a small subset have been understood. In 2005, the role of one of these proteins, pigment dispersing factor (PDF), was isolated and found to be a key mediator in the <b>circadian</b> rhythms of the cockroach.|$|E
5|$|Non-marine {{bioluminescence}} is less widely distributed, the two best-known cases {{being in}} fireflies and glow worms. Other invertebrates including insect larvae, annelids and arachnids possess bioluminescent abilities. Some forms of bioluminescence are brighter (or exist only) at night, following a <b>circadian</b> rhythm.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals can}} {{navigate}} using celestial cues {{such as the}} position of the sun. Since the sun moves in the sky, navigation by this means also requires an internal clock. Many animals depend on such a clock to maintain their <b>circadian</b> rhythm. Animals that use sun compass orientation are fish, birds, sea-turtles, butterflies, bees, sandhoppers, reptiles, and ants.|$|E
5|$|A {{fungus gnat}} from New Zealand, Arachnocampa luminosa, {{lives in the}} predator-free {{environment}} of caves and its larvae emit bluish-green light. They dangle silken threads that glow and attract flying insects, and wind in their fishing-lines when prey becomes entangled. The bioluminescence of the larvae of another fungus gnat from North America which lives on streambanks and under overhangs has a similar function. Orfelia fultoni builds sticky little webs and emits light of a deep blue colour. It has an inbuilt biological clock and, even when kept in total darkness, turns its light on and off in a <b>circadian</b> rhythm.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves filter {{large amounts}} of water to feed and breathe {{but they are not}} {{permanently}} open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submerged. In oysters, for example, their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and <b>circadian</b> rhythms according to the relative positions of the moon and sun. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during spring tides.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 American mycologist Martina S. Gilliam {{investigated}} the periodicity of spore release in M.rotula {{and concluded that}} spore discharge did not follow a regular <b>circadian</b> rhythm, as is typical of agaric and bolete mushrooms, but rather was dependent on rain. A threshold of rainfall is required to elicit a spore discharge response and the duration of peak spore discharge correlates {{with the amount of}} rainfall, rather than its duration. Furthermore, Gilliam noted that spore prints were more readily obtained if the stem ends were placed in water, suggesting that water must enter through the fruit body for discharge to occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} secretes a basal level of {{cortisol}} {{but can also}} produce bursts of the hormone in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. Cortisol is not evenly released during the day – its concentrations in the blood are highest {{in the early morning}} and lowest in the evening {{as a result of the}} <b>circadian</b> rhythm of ACTH secretion. Cortisone is an inactive product of the action of the enzyme 11β-HSD on cortisol. The reaction catalyzed by 11β-HSD is reversible, which means that it can turn administered cortisone into cortisol, the biologically active hormone.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other {{mushrooms}} {{known to}} release spores {{in response to}} a <b>circadian</b> rhythm, spore release in M.rotula is dependent upon sufficient moisture. Dried mushrooms may revive after rehydrating and continue to release spores for up to three weeks—a sustained spore production of markedly longer duration than other typical agarics. There are several species of Marasmius with which M.rotula might be confused due to somewhat similar overall appearances, but differences in size, gill arrangement, and substrate are usually sufficient field characteristics to distinguish them. Although M.rotula mushrooms are not generally considered edible, they produce a unique peroxidase enzyme that is attracting research interest for possible use in bioengineering applications.|$|E
5|$|When {{suffering}} from sleep deprivation, active immunizations {{may have a}} diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production, and a lower immune response, than would be noted in a well-rested individual. Additionally, proteins such as NFIL3, which {{have been shown to}} be closely intertwined with both T-cell differentiation and our <b>circadian</b> rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.|$|E
25|$|The <b>circadian</b> rhythm {{influences}} the ideal timing of a restorative sleep episode. Sleepiness increases during the night. REM sleep occurs more during body temperature minimum within the <b>circadian</b> cycle, whereas slow-wave sleep can occur more independently of <b>circadian</b> time.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that <b>circadian</b> desynchronization and work overload may also impair performance. Specifically, a controlled laboratory study by Wright et al. evaluated {{the relationship between}} <b>circadian</b> rhythms and performance by assessing body temperature, which is regulated by the <b>circadian</b> mechanisms of the body. Body temperature is at its highest near the <b>circadian</b> peak and lowest near the <b>circadian</b> minimum (this is when the body is driven to sleep). It has long been recognized that a positive relationship exists between daily rhythms of the body temperature and neurobehavioral performance and alertness in humans.|$|E
25|$|Working {{extended}} {{hours or}} overnight shifts also poses the added difficulty of requiring performance from an individual at a time with the body is driven to sleep by the <b>circadian</b> system. Sleep, alertness, and cognitive functioning {{are determined by the}} interaction of two processes: the endogenous <b>circadian</b> pacemaker and the homeostatic drive for sleep. The endogenous <b>circadian</b> pacemaker generates the 24-hour <b>circadian</b> rhythm that regulates subjective alertness and sleep propensity as well as core body temperature, cognitive functions, and melatonin secretion, as described above. It is also highly sensitive to light, which is its primary synchronization. Misalignment of the <b>circadian</b> rhythm results in disturbed sleep, impaired performance alertness, waking-hour melatonin secretion, and reduced levels of nocturnal secretion of growth hormone. The outcome, therefore, can range from performance error to long-term health decrements.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that miR-122 is regulated by Rev-ErbA alpha which is involved in <b>circadian</b> gene expression, suggesting that miR-122 is a <b>circadian</b> metabolic regulator. miR-122 regulates the expression of several mRNA molecules {{that are important in}} the <b>circadian</b> cycle, such as PPARβ/δ. Mature miR-122 is subject to modification by the poly(A) polymerase GLD-2, which adds a single adenosine to the miRNA 3' end. This results in an increase in miR-122 stability.|$|E
25|$|Disturbances of the <b>circadian</b> rhythm, such as {{shift work}} and jet lag, can cause an {{inability}} to sleep at some {{times of the day}} and excessive sleepiness at other times of the day. Chronic <b>circadian</b> rhythm disorders are characterized by similar symptoms.|$|E
25|$|People {{with normal}} <b>circadian</b> systems can {{generally}} fall asleep quickly at night if they slept too little the night before. Falling asleep earlier will in turn automatically help {{to advance their}} <b>circadian</b> clocks due to decreased light exposure in the evening. In contrast, people with DSPD have difficulty falling asleep before their usual sleep time, {{even if they are}} sleep-deprived. Sleep deprivation does not reset the <b>circadian</b> clock of DSPD patients, as it does with normal people.|$|E
25|$|In most vertebrates, {{exposure}} to light sets off {{a chain reaction}} of enzymatic events within the pineal gland that regulates <b>circadian</b> rhythms. In humans and other mammals, the light signals necessary to set <b>circadian</b> rhythms are sent from the eye through the retinohypothalamic system to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and the pineal gland.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, Hastings next took {{a faculty}} {{position}} in the Biochemistry Division of the Chemistry Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign where he continued his focus on dinoflagellate and bacterial luminescence and dinoflagellate <b>circadian</b> rhythms. Hastings joined the faculty of Harvard University as Professor of Biology in 1966. During this period he continued and expanded his studies of <b>circadian</b> rhythms in dinoflagellates and luminescence in bacteria, dinoflagellates and other organisms. He {{was elected to the}} National Academy of Sciences in 2003 and received the Farrell Prize in Sleep Medicine for his work on <b>circadian</b> rhythms in 2006.|$|E

25|$|<b>Circadian</b> rhythm in humans: The {{observation}} of a <b>circadian</b> or diurnal process in humans is mentioned in Chinese medical texts dated to around the 13th century, including the Noon and Midnight Manual and the Mnemonic Rhyme to Aid in the Selection of Acu-points According to the Diurnal Cycle, the Day of the Month and the Season of the Year.|$|E
25|$|Vasopressin is {{released}} into the brain in a <b>circadian</b> rhythm by neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, light {{controls}} {{the sense of}} sight and the <b>circadian</b> clock by activating light-sensitive proteins in photoreceptor cells in the eye's retina. In the case of vision, light is detected by rhodopsin in rod and cone cells. In {{the case of the}} <b>circadian</b> clock, a different photopigment, melanopsin, is responsible for detecting light in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.|$|E
25|$|In addition, kinase {{activity}} {{has been shown}} to be involved in the nuclear localization of PER and other genes involved in <b>circadian</b> rhythmicity. Therefore, it is this phosphorylation that allows PER to repress its own transcription and place a delay on the <b>circadian</b> system. Without the phosphorylation of PER, by dbt in Drosophila or by CKIε in mammals, there would be no oscillations because the feedback loop would be broken.|$|E
25|$|This two {{process model}} was first {{proposed}} in 1982 by Borbely, who called them Process S (homeostatic) and Process C (<b>Circadian)</b> respectively. He showed how the slow wave density increases {{through the night}} and then drops off {{at the beginning of the}} day while the <b>circadian</b> rhythm is like a sinusoid. He proposed that the pressure to sleep was the maximum when the difference between the two was highest.|$|E
25|$|Ghrelin levels reflect {{release in}} a <b>circadian</b> rhythm {{which can be}} {{interrupted}} by exposure to light at night.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{find that}} plants use complex {{mathematical}} calculations, similar to human <b>circadian</b> rhythms, {{to adjust their}} energy usage.|$|E
25|$|Urban environments have a {{profound}} effect on the <b>circadian</b> rhythms of humans and animals, according to a new study.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothalamus}} controls body temperature, hunger, {{important aspects}} of parenting and attachment behaviours, thirst, fatigue, sleep, and <b>circadian</b> rhythms.|$|E
25|$|The clock exerts {{constant}} {{influence on}} the body, effecting sinusoidal oscillation of body temperature between roughly 36.2°C and 37.2°C. The suprachiasmatic nucleus itself shows conspicuous oscillation activity, which intensifies during subjective day (i.e., {{the part of the}} rhythm corresponding with daytime, whether accurately or not) and drops to almost nothing during subjective night. The <b>circadian</b> pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus has a direct neural connection to the pineal gland, which releases the hormone melatonin at night. Cortisol levels typically rise throughout the night, peak in the awakening hours, and diminish during the day. <b>Circadian</b> prolactin secretion begins in the late afternoon, especially in women, and is subsequently augmented by sleep-induced secretion, to peak {{in the middle of the}} night. <b>Circadian</b> rhythm exerts some {{influence on the}} nighttime secretion of growth hormone.|$|E
25|$|Dinoflagellate <b>Circadian</b> Rhythms: Using Lingulodinium polyedrum as a model, Hastings spearheaded our {{understanding}} of the molecular mechanisms involved in control of <b>circadian</b> rhythms, which in humans are involved in sleep, jet-lag and other daily activities. His lab has shown that the rhythm of bioluminescence involves a daily synthesis and destruction of proteins. Because the mRNAs that code for these proteins remain unchanged from day to night, the synthesis of these proteins is controlled at the translational level. This work has now been expanded to other proteins in the cell. On the other hand, short pulses of inhibitors of synthesis of these proteins results in phase shifts of the <b>circadian</b> rhythm, either delays or advances, depending when the pulse is administered. At still another level, protein phosphorylation inhibitors also influence the period of the rhythm.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{timing is}} {{controlled}} by the <b>circadian</b> clock (Process C), sleep-wake homeostasis (Process S), and to some extent by individual will.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} <b>circadian</b> {{clock is}} profoundly influenced {{by changes in}} light, since these are its main clues about what time it is. Exposure to even small amounts of light during the night can suppress melatonin secretion, increase body temperature, and increase cognitive ability. Short pulses of light, {{at the right moment}} in the <b>circadian</b> cycle, can significantly 'reset' the internal clock. Blue light, in particular, exerts the strongest effect, leading to concerns that electronic media use before bed may interfere with sleep.|$|E
