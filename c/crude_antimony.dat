5000|$|The {{extraction}} of antimony from ores {{depends on the}} quality and composition of the ore. Most antimony is mined as the sulfide; lower-grade ores are concentrated by froth flotation, while higher-grade ores are heated to 500-600 °C, the temperature at which stibnite melts and separates from the gangue minerals. Antimony can be isolated from the <b>crude</b> <b>antimony</b> sulfide by reduction with scrap iron: ...|$|E
50|$|Glass of antimony, vitrum antimonii, is a {{transparent}} glass created from a preparation of antimony, historically {{used as an}} emetic. It was created using <b>crude</b> <b>antimony,</b> ground and calcined by a vehement fire, in an earthen crucible, until it no longer fumed, indicating that its sulfur was evaporated. The remaining substance (calx) was then vitrified in a wind furnace, upon which it became transparent, ruddy, and shining.|$|E
50|$|Smoke balls also {{date back}} to the 17th Century, British ones {{contained}} a mix of saltpetre, coal, pitch, tar, resin, sawdust, <b>crude</b> <b>antimony</b> and sulphur. They produced a 'noisome smoke in abundance that is impossible to bear'. In 19th century British service, they were made of concentric paper with a thickness about 1/15th of the total diameter and filled with powder, saltpetre, pitch, coal and tallow. They were used to 'suffocate or expel the enemy in casemates, mines or between decks; for concealing operations; and as signals.|$|E
50|$|With sulfide ores, {{the method}} by which {{antimony}} is produced depends {{on the amount of}} antimony in the raw ore. If the ore contains 25% to 45% antimony by weight, then <b>crude</b> <b>antimony</b> is produced by smelting the ore in a blast furnace. If the ore contains 45% to 60% antimony by weight, antimony is obtained by heating the ore, also known as liquidation. Ores with more than 60% antimony by weight are chemically displaced with iron shavings from the molten ore, resulting in impure metal.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} solve the {{shortcomings}} when removing lead from <b>crude</b> <b>antimony</b> in the traditional antimony smelting, a new process was provided using NaPO 3 as lead elimination reagent to yield phosphate slag, and it was removed by floating {{on the surface of}} the liquid antimony. Reaction mechanism was clarified by using the TG-DTA and XRD techniques and single factor experiments of removal lead from <b>crude</b> <b>antimony</b> were engaged. The results show that PbO and NaPO 3 begin endothermic reaction at 863 K (590 °C), and the reaction mainly form NaPb 4 (PO 4) 3 and NaPbPO 4 below 1123 K (850 °C) and above 1123 K (850 °C), respectively. Sb 2 O 3 and NaPO 3 start the reaction at 773 K (500 °C) and generate an antimonic salt compound. The reaction product of the mixture of PbO, Sb 2 O 3 and NaPO 3 show that NaPO 3 reacted with PbO prior when NaPO 3 was insufficient, amorphous antimony glass will be generated only when NaPO 3 was adequate. Single factor experiments were taken with NaNO 3 as oxidizing agent under argon, effect of reaction time, reaction temperature and dosage of NaPO 3 and NaNO 3 on smelting results. The average content of lead in refined antimony was 0. 05340 % and 98. 85 % of lead were removed under optimal conditions; the content of lead in antimony have meet the requirements of commercial antimony...|$|E
40|$|A {{new process}} for {{one-step}} extraction of antimony in low temperature from stibnite concentrate by reductive sulfur-fixation smelting in sodium molten salt, using iron oxide as sulfur-fixing agent, was presented. The influences of molten salt addition and composition, ferric oxide dosage, smelting temperature and duration on extraction efficiency of antimony were investigated in details, respectively. The optimum conditions were determined as follows: 1. 0 time stoichiometric requirement (α) of mixed sodium salt (αsalt = 1. 0), WNaCl:Wsalt = 40 %, αFe 2 O 3 = 1. 0, Wcoke:Wstibnite = 40 %, where W represents weight, smelting at 850 °C (1123 K) for 60 min. Under the optimum conditions, the direct recovery rate of antimony can reach 91. 48 %, and <b>crude</b> <b>antimony</b> with a purity of 96. 00 % has been achieved. 95. 31 % of sulfur is fixed {{in form of}} FeS {{in the presence of}} iron oxide. Meanwhile, precious metals contained in stibnite concentrate are enriched and recovered comprehensively in <b>crude</b> <b>antimony.</b> In comparison to traditional antimony pyrometallurgical process, the smelting temperature of present process is reduced from 1150 – 1200 °C (1423 – 1473 K) to 850 – 900 °C (1123 – 1173 K). Sulfur obtained in stibnite is fixed in FeS which avoids SO 2 emission owing to the sulfur-fixing agent. Sodium salt can be regenerated and recycled in smelting system when the molten slag is operated to filter solid residue. The solid residue is subjected to mineral dressing operation to obtain iron sulfide concentrate which can be sold directly or roasted to regenerate into iron oxide...|$|E
