40|$|Ten {{different}} equipments {{were tested}} and the fluorescent tracer method {{was used for}} determination of deposited spray drift. Measurements were carried out both {{in the field and}} in laboratory studies where three wind velocities, 1. 0, 2. 5 and 4. 0 m/s were used at different working pressures. In the field artificial collectors (filterpapers) were placed at 2. 5, 5. 0, 10. 0, 15. 0 and 20. 0 m downwind and parallel to the driving direction. A wind tunnel was utilized in the laboratory studies and measurements took place at 2. 5, 5. 0, 10. 0 and 15. 0 m from application point. Droplet size measurements were carried out with the Malvern Particle Sizer for different nozzles and at different pressures. The volume percentage consisting of droplets less than 100 μm was recorded and used as the dependent variable for fitting a linear regression model. By fitting sample values to various curves it was found that either the linear (Y=a+b*X) or the exponential (Y=a*e(b*X) (a> 0)) curve would give the best correlation. The differences recorded in spray drift deposits for the equipments tested could mainly be attributed to differences in volume percentage less than 100 μm. One exception was the CDA sprayer (Micromax) which in spite of having the smallest amount of droplets less than 100 μm resulted in relatively high spray drift deposits. It was verified that old recommendations, not to spray in strong winds (more than 3 - 4 m/s), reduce the pressure and to take relative humidity and temperature in consideration, are still valid. Furthermore it is of outmost importance to choose equipment and nozzle sizes which facilitates spraying with a low volume percentage of droplets less than 100 μm. It is felt that improvement of the hazardous drift situation could fairly easy be implemented. But the devices for measuring temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity must be accessible for every spray operator. Another way or complementory way of reducing winddrift is further development of various kinds of windproof sprayer. The last 5 - 10 years of research work in spray application has prooved that the biological effect can be improved by reducing the droplet size to achieve higher quality deposits. This will doubtlessly increase drift hazards unless adequate steps are taken. The littereture review revealed that contamination of the spray operator mainly occures during: - handling of concentrated pesticides - cleaning of blocked nozzles - cleaning/emptying of spray tanks and equipment. Further development and/or increased usage of following systems ought to efficiently contribute to the reduction of the mentioned hazards: - Closed filling systems - Dosage equipment for direct injection of the pesticide into the water, close to the nozzles - Self <b>cleaning</b> <b>nozzle...</b>|$|E

50|$|All {{units have}} {{openings}} {{that allow the}} entire fluid flow through the pipeline to bypass. The brake unit ensures that a hydraulically activated pig is held back against the fluid flow in the pipeline. The fluid pushes against the following seal unit, which channels it into the openings of the cleaning head. The seal unit and cleaning head restrict the flow, resulting in a pressure difference across the pig. Thus, the fluid is accelerated in the <b>cleaning</b> head's <b>nozzles,</b> creating extremely powerful liquid jets. These jets are directed onto the pipe inner wall to remove any kind of deposits.|$|R

50|$|Impact of a spray {{onto the}} target surface is {{expressed}} as the force/area, N/m2 or lb/in2. This value {{depends on the}} spray pattern distribution and the spray angle. Generally, solid stream nozzles or narrow spray angle flat fan nozzles are used for applications in which high impact is desired, such as <b>cleaning.</b> When a <b>nozzle</b> is used for cleaning, the impact or pressure is called impingement.

However, this could not be achieved with physical force induced wet cleaning processes such as megasonic and jet spray <b>nozzle</b> <b>cleaning</b> due to their uncertainty of cleaning force. Among other feasible cleaning methods, cryogenic aerosol cleaning {{was one of the}} leading candidate technologies for damage free cleaning as it has been successfully used to remove contaminant particles from the surface of semiconductor wafers (1).

40|$|Liquid {{sprays of}} water are {{frequently}} used in {{air pollution control}} for gas cooling purposes and for gas <b>cleaning.</b> Twin-fluid <b>nozzles</b> with internal mixing are often used for these purposes {{because of the small}} size of the drops produced. In these nozzles the liquid is dispersed by compressed air or another pressurized gas. In high efficiency scrubbers for particle separation, several nozzles are operated in parallel because {{of the size of the}} cross section. In such scrubbers, the scrubbing water has to be re-circulated. Precipitation of some solid material can occur in the liquid circuit, caused by chemical reactions. When such precipitations are detached from the place of formation, they can partly or totally block the liquid flow to a nozzle. Due to the resulting unbalanced supply of the nozzles with water and gas, the efficiency of separation decreases. Thus, the nozzles have to be cleaned if a certain fraction of blockages is reached. The aim of this study was to provide a tool for continuously monitoring the status of the nozzles of a scrubber based on the available operation data (water flow, air flow, water pressure and air pressure). The difference between the air pressure and the water pressure is not well suited for this purpose, because the difference is quite small and therefore very exact calibration of the pressure measurement would be required. Therefore, an equation for the reference air flow of a nozzle at the actual water flow and operation pressure was derived. This flow can be compared with the actual air flow for assessment of the status of the nozzles...|$|R
40|$|Solidified CO 2 pellets are an {{effective}} blast media for the cleaning {{of a variety}} of materials. CO 2 is obtained from the waste gas streams generated from other manufacturing processes and therefore does not contribute to the greenhouse effect, depletion of the ozone layer, or the environmental burden of hazardous waste disposal. The system is capable of removing as much as 90 percent of the contamination from a surface in one pass or to a high cleanliness level after multiple passes. Although the system is packaged and designed for manual hand held <b>cleaning</b> processes, the <b>nozzle</b> can easily be attached to the end effector of a robot for automated cleaning of predefined and known geometries. Specific tailoring of cleaning parameters are required to optimize the process for each individual geometry. Using optimum cleaning parameters the CO 2 systems were shown to be capable of cleaning to molecular levels below 0. 7 mg/sq ft. The systems were effective for removing a variety of contaminants such as lubricating oils, cutting oils, grease, alcohol residue, biological films, and silicone. The system was effective on steel, aluminum, and carbon phenolic substrates...|$|R
40|$|Draught beer quality can be {{compromised}} by {{the growth of}} spoilage microorganisms. Whilst best practice for assuring dispense hygiene is broadly recognized, {{it is not always}} fully or regularly implemented. In some markets, tap nozzles are removed and stored overnight at room temperature in carbonated (soda) water. The next morning they are returned (sometimes after rinsing) to the dispense tap. The effectiveness of this approach is compared with soaking in diluted line-cleaning solution (UK best practice) or a solution containing hypochlorous acid (commercial sanitizing tablets). Two novel approaches – ozonated water and use of ultrasonics – were also evaluated. Bioluminescence analysis of microbial attachment to the inner surfaces of nozzles showed that soaking in carbonated water resulted in gross contamination. Sanitizing tablets achieved ‘commercial sterility’ and a 4 -log reduction in bioluminescence compared with carbonated water. The efficacy of hypochlorous acid was confirmed by incubating cleaned nozzles in fresh beer without any increase in turbidity. Diluted line-cleaning solution was less effective and achieved a 2 -log reduction. Ultrasonics reduced microbial attachment but effectiveness was aligned to increasing process time. Soaking in ozonated water was without antimicrobial impact. This work has shown carbonated water to be ineffective in <b>cleaning</b> microbiologically contaminated <b>nozzles.</b> This is a concern as these microorganisms derive from the dispense line, the environment and likely human interaction. To minimize the risks of transfer to dispensed product or back-contaminating the dispense line, soaking draught beer nozzles in an effective sanitizing solution is strongly recommended...|$|R
