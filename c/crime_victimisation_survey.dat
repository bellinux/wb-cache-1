40|$|The author {{argues that}} {{statistics}} of police-recorded crimes have limited utility for cross-country analyses of crime, due to varying legal definitions, reporting patterns and recording practices. In his view stand alone national <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys,</b> with their varying methodologies and questionnaires, cannot reliably {{be used for}} cross-national comparisons either. This {{is especially true for}} older versions of such surveys, modelled after the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) of the USA, which try to mimic their country’s official statistics of police-recorded <b>crimes.</b> <b>Victimisation</b> <b>surveys</b> in the European tradition use less legalistic definitions of the public’s experiences of crime and are therefore more conducive to international standardisation. When such surveys are standardised to cover the common ground of crime in multiple jurisdictions, {{as is the case in}} the International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS), they can provide comparable data on the level and trends of crime of individual nations at relatively modest costs. In addition, such surveys can provide comparative data on crime reporting by victims, satisfaction with responses from police and other agencies, as well as on public attitudes toward safety and criminal justice. In the discussion, the author argues for an expedient execution of the planned EU Safety Survey in the European Union (EUSASU) and further work on the standardisation of <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys</b> across the world by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) ...|$|R

50|$|The Crime Survey for England and Wales is {{an attempt}} to measure both the amount of crime, and the impact of crime on England and Wales. The {{original}} survey (carried out in 1982, to cover the 1981 year) covered all three judicial areas of the UK, and was therefore referred to as the British Crime Survey, but now it only covers England and Wales. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, similar surveys, namely the Scottish <b>Crime</b> and <b>Victimisation</b> <b>Survey</b> and Northern Ireland Crime Survey have similar purposes. These surveys collect information about the victims of crime, the circumstances surrounding the crime, and the behaviour of the perpetrators. They are used to plan, and measure the results of, crime reduction or perception measures. In addition, they collect data about the perception of issues such as antisocial behaviour and the criminal justice system.|$|R
40|$|Background: Although <b>crime</b> <b>victimisation</b> is as {{prevalent}} in psychiatric patients as crime perpetration (and possibly more so), few European figures for it are available. We therefore assessed its one-year prevalence and incident rates in Dutch severely mentally ill outpatients, and compared the results with victimisation {{rates in the}} general population. Method: This multisite epidemiological survey included {{a random sample of}} 956 adult severely mentally ill outpatients. Data on victimisation were obtained using the victimisation scale of the Dutch <b>Crime</b> and <b>Victimisation</b> <b>Survey,</b> which assesses <b>crime</b> <b>victimisation</b> over the preceding 12 months. Comparison data were derived from the nationwide survey on safety and victimisation in the Netherlands. Prevalence and incident rates were weighted for sex, age, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and compared with a general population sample matched by region (N = 38, 227). Results: In the past year, almost half of the severely mentally ill outpatients (47 %) had been victim of a crime. After control for demographic differences, prevalence rates of overall and specific victimisation measures were significantly higher in severely mentally ill outpatients than in the general population. The relative rates were especially high for personal crimes such as violent threats (RR = 2. 12, 95 % CI: 1. 72 - 2. 61), physical assaults (RR = 4. 85, 95 % CI: 3. 69 - 6. 39) and sexual harassment and assaults (RR = 3. 94, 95 % CI: 3. 05 - 5. 09). In concordance, severely mentally ill outpatients reported almost 14 times more personal crime incidents than persons from the general population (IRR = 13. 68, 95 % CI: 12. 85 - 14. 56).

40|$|Background Crime {{victimisation}} is {{a serious}} problem in psychiatric patients. However, research has fo-cused on patients with severe mental illness and few studies exist that address victimisation in other outpatient groups, such as patients with depression. Due to large differences in methodology of the studies that address crime victimisation, a comparison of prevalence between psychiatric diagnostic groups is hard to make. Objectives of this study were to de-termine and compare one-year prevalence of violent and non-violent criminal victimisation among outpatients from different diagnostic psychiatric groups and to examine prevalence differences with the general population.

40|$|During {{the roughly}} fifty years {{following}} the Second World War, the best evidence we have from recorded <b>crimes</b> and <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys</b> suggests that the level and rate of crime rose in almost all countries for which data are available.

Moreover the falls were more than temporary blips: they have been sustained. The changes in direction in crime trajectories took almost all by surprise. They had not been expected by policy-makers, journalists, the general public or, for that matter, criminologists. It seemed to us that the international crime drop poses perhaps the most pressing questions for criminology: What exactly was happening to crime rates and why had they begun to fall? At the time of writing we have spent close to a decade working on the crime drop, trying both to describe it more precisely and to explain it...|$|R
40|$|The central {{issues that}} should be {{answered}} by the criminal statistic system pertain to the extent, structure and development of crime rates, the decisions of authorities for prosecution and sanctioning, the amount and type of imposed criminal sanctions, the enforcement of sanctions {{and the amount of}} reconviction after sanctioning. In this respect the German criminal statistic system has many deficits. Therefore it is necessary to supplement the existing statistics through periodical <b>crime</b> and <b>victimisation</b> <b>surveys,</b> to supplement the prison statistics and to implement statistics regarding suspected persons in the preliminary proceedings of public prosecutors, the enforcement of criminal sanctions as well as periodic reconviction statistic. But a comprehensive optimisation of the criminal statistics system requires the establishment of a statistical data base in which all data of the police crime statistics and all criminological relevant judicial decisions are recorded with pseudonymised individual data and subsequently linked with each other. This statistical data base will solve the problems of the current German crime statistics and will offer a basis for the implementation of new regular federal statistics, in particular with regard to the execution of a sentence and recidivism as well as the implementation of case-flow statistics and cohort studies. case-flow statistics, cohort studies, conviction statistics, crime, sanctions, criminal, police crime statistics, prison statistics, probation service statistics, recidivism, reconviction statistic, statistics of criminal courts, statistics of the public prosecution offices, <b>victimisation</b> <b>survey...</b>|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} {{on the effect of}} greater numbers of police personnel on crime and nuisance reduction in the Netherlands. We use a multiple time series design with police regions as the unit of analysis, covering the period 1996 - 2003. During this period, police resources increased substantially. The growth in additional resources differed greatly between regions, allowing us to use this policy intervention to identify the effect of police on crime and nuisance. We control for regional economic, social and demographic factors and for national trends that might obscure the effect of police on crime. We find significantly negative effects of higher police levels on property crime, violent crime and nuisance. Our estimates suggest that a substantial proportion of the decline in crime and nuisance during the period 1996 - 2003 is attributable to the increase in police personnel. police, <b>crime,</b> nuisance, effectiveness, <b>victimisation</b> <b>survey...</b>|$|R
40|$|With the ageing of the population, and {{increasing}} demand {{for individuals to}} be financially literate and self-sufficient, older Australians may find themselves {{at greater risk of}} fraud.

Crime Victimisation, Australia provides {{the results of an}} Australia-wide <b>crime</b> <b>victimisation</b> <b>survey</b> undertaken by the ABS via the Multipurpose Household Survey (MPHS). The results of the survey provide estimates of the extent of victimisation experienced by Australians aged 15 years and over for selected types of personal and household crimes. Also collected was information on whether or not victims reported the crime to police and, for some personal offences, whether the victim thought that the offender was {{under the influence of alcohol}} or another substance in the most recent incident. The following information focuses only on data made available by jurisdiction, however, Crime Victimisation, Australia also includes Australia-wide information related to victims such as gender, age group, marital status, relationship to offender, country of birth, location (capital city or balance of state/territory), level of highest non-school qualification, labour force status and weekly household income...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the concentration of schizophrenic patients to socially disadvantaged areas in Malmö. Method: A case-finding study of schizophrenia was combined with a <b>victimisation</b> <b>survey.</b> Data was factor-analysed and visualised using geographical information system software. Results: The schizophrenic patients lived predominantly in socially disorganised areas characterised by high levels of disorder, fear of <b>crime</b> and <b>victimisation.</b> Regression analyses showed that local informal social control and concrete fear of crime explained one-third of the variance in schizophrenia prevalence. Measures of victimisation and social disorder, together with schizophrenia prevalence, were found to explain 52 % of the variance of concrete fear of crime in the neighbourhood.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between experiences of <b>crime</b> <b>victimisation</b> and self-reported measures of social capital and social cohesion. It is widely acknowledged that a complex relationship exists between crime, feelings of personal safety, and social wellbeing. Experiences of crime and feelings of personal safety {{can be seen as}} both indicators and outcomes of social wellbeing, as well as interacting with social wellbeing in a multifaceted and complex manner. Experiencing <b>crime</b> <b>victimisation</b> may be associated with poorer outcomes on some measures of social wellbeing, and more favourable outcomes on other measures.

40|$|In 2011, a {{large-scale}} mixed-mode experiment {{was linked to}} the <b>Crime</b> <b>Victimisation</b> <b>Survey</b> (CVS). This experiment consisted of a randomized allocation of sample persons to the four contemporary survey modes Web, mail, telephone and face-to-face, and a follow-up using only interviewer modes. The aim of the experiment was to disentangle mode-specific selection- and measurement bias. In a previous paper (Schouten et al 2013), mode-specific selection and measurement biases were reported for a large number of key variables from the CVS and the Labour Force Survey. This paper is a follow-up to that study and investigates the size of the selection and measurement biases as a function of contact effort, where contact effort refers to the number of telephone calls, the number of face-to-face visits and the number of reminders in Web and mail. In the analyses, face-to-face response based on a maximum of six visits, the default face-to-face strategy at Statistics Netherlands, is used as the benchmark. The analyses show that contact effort has little impact on the size of measurement bias and a modest impact on the size of selection bias. From the results, it is therefore concluded that contact effort is not a strong common cause of nonresponse and measurement error...|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} {{current trends}} in {{domestic violence and}} factors associated with reporting offences to police in NSW. Method: Descriptive analyses were conducted on all incidents of domestic assault recorded by NSW Police between 2001 and 2010. Factors associated with reporting of offences to police were examined using the Australian Bureau of Statistics, <b>Crime</b> <b>Victimisation</b> <b>Survey</b> 2008 - 2009. Results: Over the last 10 years the trend in domestic assault has been stable across NSW and has fallen slightly in regional areas. The majority of incidents of domestic assaults occurred on residential premises between 6 pm and 9 pm, Saturdays and Sundays. Alcohol remains an associated factor {{in many of these}} incidents. Victims were predominantly female and offenders predominantly male. The overrepresentation of Indigenous Australians as both victims and offenders of domestic assault has not changed over the last decade. Less than half of all respondents who had been the victim of a domestic assault in the previous 12 months reported the incident to the police. Older victims, those who were married and victims of assaults that did not involve weapons or serious injury were less likely to report to police. Conclusions: While the incidence of domestic assault has been stable across the last 10 years, it continues to be problematic at certain times, in certain places and particularly in some Indigenous communities. Efforts to increase reporting of assault may be best targeted at the subgroups identified in this report who are currently less inclined to report assaults to police...|$|E
40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is {{a significant}} issue in New Zealand. Reported rates of IPV for New Zealand over a lifetime are estimated at 26 % for women 18 % for men. Over a 12 month period reported rates of IPV was reported at three percent for women and one point eight percent for men (Morris and Reilly, 2003). This thesis set out {{to answer the following}} research questions: 1. What factors are strong predictors for intimate partner violence victimisation? 2. Is victim ethnicity factored out when variables such as SES, income and/or employment status are taken into account? This thesis analysed complex survey data from New Zealand National <b>Survey</b> of <b>Crime</b> and <b>Victimisation</b> <b>Survey</b> 2001 (NZNSCV). Logistic regression analysis was use to investigate the risk factors for victimisation reported over a lifetime and reported in the previous 12 month period (2000). Explanatory variables were selected from existing research that identified key variables for analysis. In answer to the research questions: 1. The strong predictors for IPV over a lifetime were Maori, people aged 25 - 39 years, females, solo parents, over-crowded households, those on social welfare benefits, and those divorced or separated. For 12 month prevalence of IPV strong predictors were those aged 15 - 24 years, Maori, lower NZSEI groups, solo parents with children, those in defacto relationships {{and those who do not}} own or rent a house. 2. Ethnicity is strongly significant in explaining victimisation even when other variables are factored into the model. In particular Maori reported to be twice as likely to be victims of IPV over a lifetime and three-and-a-half times more likely over the past 12 month period (Morris and Riley). This difference in reporting was not as large when other factors where factored in, however Maori remained at a significantly higher rate of reporting IPV than other ethnic groups, even when other variables are factored in.

40|$|Background Crime {{victimisation}} is {{a serious}} problem in psychiatric patients. However, research has focused on patients with severe mental illness and few studies exist that address victimisation in other outpatient groups, such as patients with depression. Due to large differences in methodology of the studies that address crime victimisation, a comparison of prevalence between psychiatric diagnostic groups is hard to make. Objectives of this study were to determine and compare one-year prevalence of violent and non-violent criminal victimisation among outpatients from different diagnostic psychiatric groups and to examine prevalence differences with the general population. Method Criminal victimisation prevalence was measured in 300 outpatients living in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with outpatients with depressive disorder (n = 102), substance use disorder (SUD, n = 106) and severe mental illness (SMI, n = 92) using a National <b>Crime</b> <b>Victimisation</b> <b>Survey,</b> and compared with a matched general population sample (n = 10865). Results Of all outpatients, 61 % reported experiencing some kind of victimisation over the past year; 33 % reported violent victimisation (3. 5 times more than the general population) and 36 % reported property crimes (1. 2 times more than the general population). Outpatients with depression (67 %) and SUD (76 %) were victimised more often than SMI outpatients (39 %). Younger age and hostile behaviour were associated with violent victimisation, while being male and living alone were associated with non-violent victimisation. Moreover, SUD was associated with both violent and non-violent victimisation. Conclusion Outpatients with depression, SUD, and SMI are at increased risk of victimisation compared to the general population.

Executive summary This report seeks to estimate how much crime costs the Australian economy by calculating the number of crimes that come {{to the attention of}} the authorities and, using <b>crime</b> <b>victimisation</b> <b>survey</b> data, the number of crimes that are not recorded officially. A dollar figure is then calculated for each estimated crime event and an indication given of the total cost of each specific crime type in terms of actual loss, intangible losses, loss of output caused through the criminal conduct and other related costs such as medical expenses, where relevant. Added to these costs are the costs of preventing and responding to crime in the community including the costs of maintaining the criminal justice system agencies of police, prosecution, courts and correctional agencies, as well as a proportion of the costs of Australian and state and territory government agencies that have crime-related functions. Finally, a deduction is made for the value of property recovered in the case of property crime, as well as the amount of funds recovered from criminals under federal, state and territory proceeds of crime legislation. More detailed information about how each of these estimates was derived is provided in the main body of the report. Official attention paid to specific crime types, particularly drug-related crime and organised crime, affects both the reporting rate and also the cost of policing and correctional responses. In this sense, individual crime type costs and prevention and response costs are not mutually exclusive. Arguably, as individual crime types attract more attention, reporting rates increase and prevention and control of the crimes in question are seen as being deserving of increased resource...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Property {{damage is}} the {{intentional}} ‘destruction or defacement of public, commercial and private property’. This covers {{a range of}} different acts, including vandalism (eg smashing windows, knocking over letterboxes) and graffiti. Graffiti is the act of marking property with writing, symbols or graphics and is illegal when committed without the property owner’s consent. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ <b>Crime</b> <b>Victimisation</b> <b>Survey</b> 2011 – 2012, malicious property damage was more common than any other property offence, with 7. 5 percent of respondents reporting having been a victim in the previous 12 months. The cost of property damage to private property owners, local and state governments and businesses are significant, with an estimated cost of $ 1, 522 per incident (in 2012 dollars) and a total cost to the Australian community of nearly $ 2 billion each year. Using the handbook This handbook forms {{part of a series}} of guides developed by the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) to support local commerce groups (ie representative groups for business owners and operators), local government and the police to implement evidence-based crime prevention strategies. This handbook has been developed to help guide project managers through the stages of planning, implementing and evaluating a crime prevention project to reduce property damage offences in their local community, particularly in and around commercial precincts. The handbook provides an overview of the three key stages that are involved in delivering a project to reduce property damage: 	Stage 1 : Planning; 	Stage 2 : Implementation; and 	Stage 3 : Review. These steps do not necessarily need to be undertaken in order. Some steps may be undertaken concurrently or {{it may be necessary to}} revisit earlier steps. However, it is vital that some steps, such as consulting stakeholders and planning for evaluation, be undertaken early on in the project. Property damage is a very broad offence category. The choice of a particular intervention or interventions will depend largely on the nature of the local problem. Similarly, the successful implementation of a prevention strategy will often be heavily influenced by the characteristics of the local community. This needs to be considered throughout the life of a project...|$|E

40|$|Exploring {{long term}} trends in crime and {{criminal}} justice is a multifaceted exercise. This research note introduces the construction and methodological benefits {{of a series of}} new datasets that amalgamate approximately thirty years of public data on <b>crime,</b> <b>victimisation,</b> fear of <b>crime,</b> social and political attitudes with national socio-economic indicators in England and Wales. The data operates at both an aggregate and individual level and will be available for public use (and modification) from autumn 2015. Here, we outline the contours and contents of the dataset and highlight the importance of using longitudinal data in exploring theoretical and empirical questions about <b>crime,</b> <b>victimisation</b> and social attitudes...|$|R
