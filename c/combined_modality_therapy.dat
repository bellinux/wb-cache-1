No published meta-analysis (Fung et al, 2003; Banu et al, 2005; Liang, 2005; Bria et al, 2006; Milella et al, 2006) has included randomised controlled trials employing radiation therapy. The aim of this systematic review was to compare the following: (i) chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy (<b>combined</b> <b>modality</b> <b>therapy)</b> vs best supportive care (ii) radiotherapy vs chemoradiation (iii) radiotherapy vs <b>combined</b> <b>modality</b> <b>therapy</b> (iv) chemotherapy vs <b>combined</b> <b>modality</b> <b>therapy</b> (v) 5 FU-based combined modality treatment vs another-agent-based <b>combined</b> <b>modality</b> <b>therapy.</b> Relevant randomised controlled trials were identified by searching databases, trial registers and conference proceedings. The primary end point was overall survival and secondary end points were progression-free survival/time-to-progression, response rate and adverse events. Survival data were summarised using hazard ratio (HR) and response-rate/adverse-event data with relative risk. Eleven trials involving 794 patients met the inclusion criteria. Length of survival with chemoradiation was increased compared with radiotherapy alone (two trials, 168 patients, HR 0. 69; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 51 – 0. 94), but chemoradiation followed by chemotherapy {{did not lead to}} a survival advantage over chemotherapy alone (two trials, 134 patients, HR 0. 79; CI 0. 32 – 1. 95).

40|$|The {{delivery}} of postoperative <b>combined</b> <b>modality</b> adjuvant <b>therapy</b> for completely resected pancreatic cancer was initially {{shown to be}} beneficial {{on the basis of}} a prospective, randomized trial published in 1985. Since then, oncologists have debated whether chemotherapy, chemoradiation, or both is optimal adjuvant therapy after pancreatectomy for ductal ade-nocarcinoma of the pancreas; no global consensus has emerged. Unfortunately, despite the completion of a number of subsequent randomized trials of adjuvant therapy since 1985, no further improvements in overall survival have materialized. This lack of progress is not simply the result of ineffective systemic therapies, but in part the result of poor trial design and calls for a more disciplined approach to the selection of patients for surgery, pathologic assessment of surgical resection margins, and postoperative (pretreatment) imaging. This is the only way to ensure that patients who receive adjuvant therapy are actually receiving therapy for radiographically occult possible microscopic disease, rather than therapy for incompletely resected locally advanced disease or early postoperative metastases.

40|$|Recent {{understanding}} of the unique pathology of solid tumours has {{shed light on the}} difficult and disappointing nature of their clinical treatment. All solid tumours undergo angiogenesis that results in biological changes and adaptive metabolisms, i. e. formation of defective vessels, appearance of hypoxic areas, and emergence of an heterogeneous tumour cell population. This micro-milieu provides a haven for anaerobic bacteria. The strictly anaerobic clostridia have several advantages over other facultative anaerobes such as salmonella or lactic acid-producing, Gram-positive, obligate, anaerobic bifidobacteria. Both pathogenic and non-pathogenic clostridia have been demonstrated to specifically colonise and destroy solid tumours. Early trials of non-pathogenic strains in humans had shown plausible safety. Genetic modifications and adaptation of pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains have further created improved features. However, these manipulations rarely generate strains that resulted in complete tumour control alone. <b>Combined</b> <b>modalities</b> of <b>therapies</b> with chemo and radiation therapies, on the other hand, often perform better, including 'cure' of solid tumours in a high percentage of animals.

There were 19 patients with diffuse histiocytic, 4 diffuse lymphocytic poorly differentiated and 2 diffuse mixed lymphoma. Their median age was 51 years. There were 12 males and 13 females.

All patients had complete remission but 9 patients (36 per cent) subsequently had relapse of their lymphomas. Stomach was the commonest site of relapse (44 per cent). The disease free survival and overall survival at 5 years were 59 per cent and 57 per cent respectively.

Secondary lymphedema is a potential complication that may affect the quality of life of patients treated for breast cancer. Life-long risk factors of post-breast cancer lymphedema are related to the extent of axillary node involvement, type of breast surgery, and radiation therapy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{determined}} {{the incidence of}} complications in 133 patients who had undergone staging laparotomy with splenectomy before treatment for Hodgkin's disease (stages I-IV). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records were reviewed, and the patients or their relatives were interviewed. Median follow-up after laparotomy was 15. 7 years (range = 2. 5 - 28 years). RESULTS: Ten episodes of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) were documented in nine patients (6. 8 %). None of 25 patients who received pneumococcal vaccine before splenectomy developed OPSI. Patients with advanced (stages III-IV) or recurrent Hodgkin's disease were at higher risk of OPSI than those with early disease, and those who received <b>combined</b> <b>modality</b> oncologic <b>therapy</b> were at greater risk than those receiving less intensive treatment. Surgical complications included small bowel obstruction in 13 patients (9. 8 %), necessitating repeat laparotomy in 9 patients (6. 8 %), atelectasis in 17 patients, abscess in 3 patients, and 1 wound dehiscence.

The risk of late relapse was also greater in patients with stage II disease and in those without B symptoms at presentation. Patients falling into the higher risk categories for late relapse require continued close follow-up beyond 3 years to monitor for possible relapse. Early stage Hodgkin's disease has a good prognosis with modern management and prolonged survival is reported in about 80 % of patients (Hoppe et al., 1982; Peckham et al., 1982; Tubiana et al., 1984). A number of factors predicting for relapse and survival have been identified (Yarnold et al., 1982; Mill & Lee, 1982; Haybittle et al., 1985; Horwich et al., 1986), which has allowed selection of patients with poorrisk disease for treatment with <b>combined</b> <b>modality</b> <b>therapy.</b> Historically the majority of patients who relapsed did so within 3 years of their primary treatment (Herman et al., 1985) but the reduction in early relapses with the development of better staging and effective therapy has increased the proportion of patients at risk of late relapse.

Objectives Using a sample of Portuguese patients in outpatient treatment for drug and alcohol abuse, this study aimed to examine if a <b>combined</b> treatment <b>modality</b> (group <b>therapy</b> with individual intervention) had greater overall efficacy when compared to other three types of treatment without group therapy. Methods This is a correlational and cross-sectional study using a convenience sample of patients (N = 254) from an outpatient treatment in the Intervention Service on Addictive Behaviors and Substance Dependence. At the time of data collection, the patients were attending four types of treatment, such as receiving intervention based on individual psychological counseling (n = 66); receiving individual psychiatric counseling (n = 68); receiving both individual psychological and psychiatric counseling (n = 102); and receiving not only individual counseling (i. e., psychology or psychiatry), but also attending group therapy (n = 18).
