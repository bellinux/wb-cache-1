40|$|Faults in wiring {{systems are}} a serious {{concern for the}} {{aerospace}} and aeronautic (commercial, military, and civilian) industries. Circuit failures and vehicle accidents have occurred and {{have been attributed to}} faulty wiring created by open and/or short circuits. Often, such circuit failures occur due to vibration during vehicle launch or operation. Therefore, developing non-intrusive fault-tolerant techniques is necessary to detect circuit faults and automatically route signals through alternate recovery paths while the vehicle or lunar surface systems equipment is in operation. Electrical connector concepts combining dust mitigation strategies and cable diagnostic technologies have significant application for lunar and Martian surface systems, as well as for dusty terrestrial applications. The dust-tolerant intelligent electrical connection system has several novel concepts and unique features. It combines intelligent cable diagnostics (health monitoring) and automatic circuit routing capabilities into a dust-tolerant electrical umbilical. It retrofits a clamshell protective dust cover to an existing connector for reduced gravity operation, and features a universal connector housing with three styles of dust protection: inverted cap, rotating cap, and clamshell. It uses a self-healing membrane as a dust barrier for electrical <b>connectors</b> <b>where</b> required, while also combining lotus leaf technology for applications where a dust-resistant coating providing low surface tension is needed to mitigate Van der Waals forces, thereby disallowing dust particle adhesion to connector surfaces. It also permits using a ruggedized iris mechanism with an embedded electrodynamic dust shield as a dust barrier for electrical <b>connectors</b> <b>where</b> required...|$|R
50|$|There {{are seven}} common patterns, with {{any number of}} pins from three to eight. Three {{different}} five-pin connectors exist, known as 180°, 240°, and domino/360°/270° after {{the angle of the}} arc swept between the first and last pin (see figures above). There are also two variations of the six-pin, seven-pin and eight-pin <b>connectors,</b> one <b>where</b> the outer pins form 360° and one where they form 270°. There is some limited compatibility, for example a three-pin connector will fit any 180° five-pin socket, engaging three of the pins and leaving the other two unconnected, a 180° five-pin plug will fit into a seven- or eight-pin socket. 3-pin and 180° 5-pin connectors will also fit the 270° 7-pin and both 8-pin sockets. In addition to these connectors, there are also connectors with 10, 12 and 14 pins. Some high-range equipment used seven-pin <b>connectors</b> <b>where</b> the outer two carried digital system data: if the connected equipment was incompatible, the outer two pins could be unscrewed from plugs so that they fitted into standard five-pin 180° sockets without data connections.|$|R
50|$|Reflecting {{the same}} {{confusion}} {{of the letters}} DB with just D as mentioned above, high density connectors are also often called DB-15HD (or even DB-15 or HD-15), DB-26HD (HD-26), DB-44HD, DB-62HD, and DB-78HD <b>connectors,</b> respectively, <b>where</b> HD stands for high density.|$|R

He also served as Chairman of the Board of the Massachusetts Health <b>Connector,</b> <b>where</b> he oversaw implementation of Massachusetts’ health care reform, and he co-chaired the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center.|$|E
5000|$|Crimp {{contacts}} are {{assembled by}} inserting a stripped wire end into a cavity {{in the rear}} of the contact, then crushing the cavity using a crimp tool, causing the cavity to grip the wire tightly at many points. The crimped contact is then inserted into the <b>connector</b> <b>where</b> it locks into place. Individual crimped pins can be removed later by inserting a special tool into the rear of the connector.|$|E
50|$|Field-mountable {{optical fiber}} {{connectors}} {{are used to}} join optical fiber jumper cables that contain one singlemode fiber. These assemblies can be separated into two major categories: single-jointed connector assemblies and multiple-jointed connector assemblies. According to Telcordia GR-1081, a single-jointed connector assembly is a <b>connector</b> assembly <b>where</b> {{there is only one}} spot where two different fibers are joined together. This is the situation generally found when connector assemblies are made from factory-assembled optical fiber connector plugs. A multiple-jointed connector assembly is a <b>connector</b> assembly <b>where</b> {{there is more than one}} closely spaced connection joining different fibers together. An example of a multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly that uses the stub-fiber type of connector plug.|$|R
5000|$|DA15S {{connectors}} {{are used}} for PC joystick <b>connectors,</b> <b>where</b> each DA15 <b>connector</b> supports two joysticks each with two analog axes and two buttons. In other words, one DA15S [...] "game adapter" [...] connector has 4 analog potentiometer inputs and 4 digital switch inputs. This interface is strictly input-only, though it does provide +5 V DC power. Some joysticks with more than two axes and/or more than two buttons use the signals designated for both joysticks. Conversely, Y-adapter cables are available that allow two separate joysticks {{to be connected to}} a single DA15 game adapter port; if a joystick connected to one of these Y-adapters has more than two axes or buttons, only the first two of each will work.|$|R

Three-contact versions {{are known as}} TRS <b>connectors,</b> <b>where</b> T stands for [...] "tip", R stands for [...] "ring" [...] and S stands for [...] "sleeve". Ring contacts are typically the same diameter as the sleeve, the long shank. Similarly, two-, four- and five- contact versions are called TS, TRRS and TRRRS connectors respectively. The outside diameter of the [...] "sleeve" [...] conductor is 1⁄4 inch (6.35 millimetres). The [...] "mini" [...] connector has a diameter of 3.5 mm and the [...] "sub-mini" [...] connector has a diameter of 2.5 mm.|$|R
5000|$|The pinout can {{typically}} {{be shown}} as a table or diagram, {{though it is}} necessary to clarify how to view the diagram, stating if it shows the backside of the <b>connector</b> (<b>where</b> wires are attached) or the [...] "mating face" [...] of the connector. Published pinouts, which are particularly important when different manufacturers want to interconnect their products using open standards, are typically provided by the connector or equipment manufacturer. Some pinouts are provided by 3rd parties since some connectors are not well documented by the manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Hard drives {{were not}} {{standard}} equipment, {{and were not}} required for most uses. The OS was loaded from CD-ROM by default. A SCSI Centronics 50/SCSI-1/Full-Pitch port was provided for connecting external SCSI disk drives, and {{was the most common}} way to connect a hard drive to an FM Towns PC. Although internal drives are rare, there is a hidden compartment with a SCSI 50-pin <b>connector</b> <b>where</b> a hard drive may be connected, however the power supply module does not typically provide the required Molex connector to power the drive.|$|E
50|$|K'Nex {{connectors}} {{also come}} {{in a range of}} types, each having a different number of slots. They can link the rods together in different ways. The first way is to insert the end of a rod into a slot on the <b>connector,</b> <b>where</b> it snaps firmly into place. Rods connect at angles which are multiples of 45 degrees. The second method is to snap the rod into one of the connector slots perpendicular to first method. The rods cannot rotate and will not move without deliberate force. The third way is to slip the rod through a round hole in the connector. The rod can slide and rotate freely while in the hole.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of some experimental EMC tests performed on different mobile synchronous generators. These results show that, besides normal EMI generated by rectifying diodes in the field current circuit, additional noise raises from mechanical vibration of electric connection devices and friction between different insulating materials. Further investigations demonstrate that such vibration-derived EMI depends on connectivity of both of inner and outer wire <b>connectors,</b> <b>where</b> load and field currents are flowing. The experiments reveal these additional EMI generating mechanisms by comparing the synchronous generator EMI before and after proper modifications of the power cable connection and layout. Also rubbing different insulating materials can produce static electricity discharge, which results in additional EMI source. Further suggestions for EMI reduction are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|The EPS {{standard}} {{provides a}} more powerful and stable environment for critical server-based systems and applications. EPS power supplies have a 24-pin motherboard power connector and an eight-pin +12 V connector. The standard also specifies two additional four-pin 12 V connectors for more power-hungry boards (one required on 700-800 W PSUs, both required on 850 W+ PSUs). EPS power supplies are in principle compatible with standard ATX or ATX12V motherboards found in homes and offices {{but there may be}} mechanical issues where the 12 V connector {{and in the case of}} older boards the main connector overhang the sockets. Many PSU vendors use <b>connectors</b> <b>where</b> the extra sections can be unclipped to avoid this issue. As with later versions of the ATX PSU standard, there is also no −5 V rail.|$|R
50|$|As {{through-hole}} components {{have been}} largely replaced by surface mount components, wave soldering has been supplanted by reflow soldering methods in many large-scale electronics applications. However, there is still significant wave soldering where surface-mount technology (SMT) is not suitable (e.g., large power devices and high pin count <b>connectors),</b> or <b>where</b> simple through-hole technology prevails (certain major appliances).|$|R
50|$|The MC4 system {{consists}} of a plug and socket design. Oddly, the plugs and sockets are placed inside plastic shells {{that appear to be}} the opposite gender - the plug is inside a cylindrical shell that looks like a female connector but is referred to as male, and the socket is inside a square probe that looks male but is electrically female. The female connector has two plastic fingers that have to be pressed toward the central probe slightly to insert into holes {{in the front of the}} male connector. When the two are pushed together, the fingers slide down the holes until they reach a notch cut into the side of the male <b>connector,</b> <b>where</b> they pop outward to lock the two together.|$|E
50|$|From {{its eastern}} {{terminus}} is Muscatine, Iowa 92 immediately becomes concurrent with Business U.S. Highway 61 and follows Business 61 southbound in a southwesterly direction towards the southern terminus of Business 61 near the Muscatine Industrial <b>Connector</b> <b>where</b> they meet U.S. Highway 61. After that intersection, Iowa 92 is then concurrent with U.S. 61 southbound for about 11 mi and crosses {{the border from}} Muscatine County into Louisa County. Near the Louisa County town of Grandview, Iowa 92 splits off from U.S. 61 heading west and passes by the Louisa County town of Fredonia, crosses the Iowa River and passes through Columbus Junction. A few miles later, Iowa 92 crosses the border from Louisa County into Washington County. Iowa 92 intersects U.S. Highway 218 and Iowa Highway 27 at a freeway interchange before passing through Ainsworth. After 7 more miles, it enters the city of Washington, which is the county seat for Washington County.|$|E
50|$|The road {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} with an entrance {{road to the}} Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge in Lake Buena Vista. For its westernmost 0.4 mi, it has many characteristics of an at-grade boulevard; however, east of the entrance to Disney's Animal Kingdom, it becomes a grade-separated expressway. Heading east, the parkway passes through several sections of the Disney World Complex before intersecting with World Drive and crossing into Osceola County. The parkway exits Walt Disney World, just before an interchange with Interstate 4. Although Osceola Parkway was built across Interstate 4 into Walt Disney World, an interchange with that freeway (Exit 65) did not open until 2001. The ramps with the exit to nearby SR 536 are interspersed such that traffic going on to I-4 from SR 536 cannot directly exit onto Osceola Parkway, and vice versa. The road then has an interchange with the Southern <b>Connector,</b> <b>where</b> the Parkway becomes a limited access toll road (although not a full expressway). The parkway passes through residential areas, passing through an interchange with Poinciana Blvd., featuring ramp tolls of $0.75 for eastbound exiting traffic and westbound entering traffic. East of the interchange, Osceola Parkway crosses the one mainline toll plaza just east of Shingle Creek, with a $1.75 toll as of April 2009.|$|E

5000|$|... 3.5 mm TRRS (stereo-plus-mic) sockets became {{particularly}} {{common on}} smartphones, {{and have been}} used e.g. by Nokia since 2006; they are often compatible with standard 3.5 mm stereo headphones. Two different forms are frequently found, both of which place left audio on the tip and right audio on the first ring (mirroring the configuration found on stereo <b>connectors).</b> <b>Where</b> they differ is in {{the placement of the}} microphone and return contacts. The first, which places the ground return on the second ring and the microphone on the sleeve, is used by Apple's iPhone line (With the iPhone 7, Apple has replaced the standard 3.5mm jack with their proprietary Lightning connector), HTC devices, latest Samsung, Nokia and Sony phones, among others. The second, which reverses these contacts, is used by older Nokia mobiles, older Samsung smartphones and some Sony Ericsson phones. There are adapters that swap the poles over to allow a device made to one standard to be used with a headset made to the other.|$|R
5000|$|Music venues, concert halls, and {{recording}} studios {{also use a}} thicker, hose-like cord called a snake cable (or a [...] "snake"), which consists of a bundle of many individual cables with patch bays at either end so that audio gear can be connected. The patch bay is a flat panel of audio <b>connectors</b> <b>where</b> XLR cables (often both [...] "male" [...] and [...] "female") and 1/4 inch jacks can be plugged in. The [...] "snake" [...] cable makes setup more convenient, because if a sound engineer {{did not have a}} [...] "snake", she or he would have to run 20 or 30 individual microphone and instrument cables from the stage to the mixing booth. The cables could get tangled or mixed up, and {{it would be hard to}} know, when faced with 20 connectors at the end of the cable run, which cable was associated with which microphone or instrument. The patch bay is numbered, so that the engineer can note which microphone or instrument is plugged into each numbered connection.|$|R
40|$|The Active Bridge is an op-amp based {{reflection}} {{bridge that}} produces an output {{proportional to the}} signal reflected by an attached device under test (DUT). It can therefore be used with the MSA in Reflection mode to measure reflection coefficients, also known as S 11. The schematic of the active bridge is shown in Appendix A. A photo of an assembled bridge is shown in Appendix B. The bridge contains two op amps. The input is buffered by the first op amp and sent to an output connector for the DUT. The reflection from the DUT returns to that <b>connector</b> <b>where</b> it is amplified by the second op amp. The DUT port presents a nice 50 -ohm impedance to the DUT, which {{as we will see}} is an important feature The mechanism by which the second op amp ends up amplifying the reflection from the DUT, rather than the signal sent to the DUT, is a little tricky. It is explained here by Charles Wenzel, who devised the original op amp circulator circuit from which the Active Bridge was derived. Suffice it to say that any signal received at the DUT port is amplified by the second op amp, but any signal transmitted out the DUT port is not. The Active Bridge can also be used simply as a buffer amplifier, as described below...|$|E
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Licenciatura en Ingeniería en Electrónica) Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Ingeniería Electrónica, 2017. Cables and {{connectors}} {{represent the}} fundamental base of electronic systems without them {{most of the}} devices used daily as cell phones, tablet computers among many others, would not work. For example, if there are flaws in some inner wires of conventional cell phone use, said movable stop functioning immediately following the affected person {{would be in a}} state of confinement to replace or repair the device. For this reason, in building quality cables and connectors it is essential {{and one of the most}} important features in production. SAMTEC company reaches Costa Rica in 2006, since then produces over 1, 000 different products used in cars as well as airplanes computers at NASA and the US Army. Quality, hand in hand with performance verification systems and extensive testing 100 % of production guarantee products of high demand for efficiency and effectiveness. Being one of the goals SAMTEC the keep pace with technological growth and meet the expectations of the demanding labor market, it proposes the development of a project, which aims to eliminate production errors in connectors have cable color, which they have a color pattern set by the client and that order should not be altered. These connectors are of SFSD of SAMTEC series and assembled manually by an operator inserting each wire individually so that human error is the basis of the problem. To achieve eliminate production problems two stages were developed, the first one assisted assembly system for the operator, where using a visual aid, it shows the position and color of the cable to be inserted once the cable set, it indicates the position and color of the next cable. The second stage is a final check of the finished <b>connector,</b> <b>where</b> by a camera and Vision Builder National Instruments software, verified that all cables are in the position that corresponds as color pattern, otherwise, the system indicates that an error exists in the connector...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho {{consiste}} na identificação de novas configurações sociais a partir dos meios digitais de comunicação, especificamente o Orkut. Buscamos compreender de que forma os deficientes físicos utilizam este instrumento com fins de socialização e pertencimento. Para isso, mapeamos as comunidades de deficientes físicos no Orkut e identificamos seus usos, além de realizarmos entrevistas com membros das comunidades em questão. Notamos que, diferentemente dos contatos mistos travados no mundo virtual, nas comunidades específicas de deficientes, eles expõem sua deficiência como marca que legitima o pertencimento ao grupo. Os contatos travados nessas comunidades não se restringem ao espaço próprio da comunidade, mas se estendem, não só por outros instrumentos do mundo virtual, mas também às relações no espaço físico. Notamos também que o maior interesse dos membros dessas comunidades é conhecer pessoas com quem eles possam se relacionar, utilizando o espaço virtual como conector, pelo qual se explora o perfil do outro e se apresenta, com fins de se expor. Essa utilização busca suprir a lacuna que há no espaço das cidades, que não oportuniza muitos encontros entre deficientes, enquanto o mundo virtual oferece essa possibilidade com fácil acesso. Our aim in {{this research}} is to identify new social configurations {{that emerged from the}} digital media, specifically the Orkut. We try to understand how the physically disabled people use this instrument to get to socialize and belong to a group. For this purpose, we mapped the communities of physically disabled people in the Orkut and identified their uses, beyond interviewing members of these communities. We noticed that, in the communities that are specifically for disabled people, they expose their disabilities as a symbol of belonging, in a different way of the mixed interactions. The people who {{get to know each other}} in those communities dont socialize only in that specific space, but they maintain contact in other virtual and physical spaces. We also noticed that the main interest of the members of those communities is to get to know other people, so they can have relationships, using that virtual space as a <b>connector,</b> <b>where</b> they can explore the others profile and expose themselves. This way of using the community is an alternative to the gap that exists in the cities, that dont offer many opportunities of meeting.
