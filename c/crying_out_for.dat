5|$|Immense {{quantities}} {{of dust and}} coal rose {{high into the air}} in an inverted cone...In the village of Heworth, this cloud caused a darkness like that of early twilight and covered the roads so thickly that the footsteps of passengers were deeply imprinted in it. As soon as the explosion was heard, wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, some <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.|$|E

Suddenly the house grows cold and Clara feels something holding her hand when there's nothing there. The two race back to where the Professor and Emma are waiting to see Palmer's equipment activating of its own accord. A thin black disc materializes in front of them and Emma senses something <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> help as the ghost appears in a dark hallway crying for help. The Doctor quickly takes pictures of them before the disc vanishes and the house returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Cove Neck {{immediately}} called emergency services. Jeff Race, a paramedic {{and member of}} New York City's Emergency Medical Service who lived {{half a mile from}} the crash site was the first rescuer on site. He reported that most passengers were still strapped in their seats and the survivors were <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> help. Survivors later commented that it took about half an hour for rescue teams to arrive. Initial reports to emergency services reported that a much larger Boeing 747 had crashed. Fire Chief Thomas Reardon of Oyster Bay Fire Company No. 1 {{was in charge of the}} initial effort to remove people from the wreckage. In his first call to the Nassau County Fire Commission dispatch, he requested all the help available. Thirty-seven fire and ambulance companies, as well as more than seven hundred Nassau County police officers arrived to help. Other companies that were not called showed up voluntarily to assist. The swell of support created major problems for extricating survivors.|$|E

Adam R. Holz of Plugged In included the song among the [...] "objectionable content" [...] {{on the record}} because of its [...] "sad" [...] themes. In 2015, singer Sam Smith wrote on Twitter, [...] "You never really can fix a heart", to which Lovato replied, [...] "let's do a remake of that song together". After this, the hashtag #DemiLovatoFeatSamSmith became a trending topic on the website. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that releasing a remix of the track alongside Smith would be a [...] "wise" [...] idea. The collaboration, however, never materialized.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Diamonds" [...] is a {{departure}} from Rihanna's recurring themes of unhealthy relationships on her other songs, and contains a prominent concept of love. The first verse introduces the song's concept: [...] "Find light in the beautiful sea / I choose to be happy / You and I, you and I / We're like diamonds in the sky." [...] The hook continues this metaphor: [...] "So shine bright, tonight, you and I / We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye, so alive." [...] According to Glenn Yoder of The Boston Globe, the song shows Rihanna differently than how she is viewed by the public because of lyrics such as [...] "I choose to be happy" [...] and [...] "We're like diamonds in the sky". James Montgomery of MTV News commented that she embraces the positivity and fulfillment of a realized relationship, particularly with the line [...] "When you hold me, I'm alive", and admits [...] "I knew that we'd become one right away". Lindsay DiMattina of Hollywood.com interpreted that Rihanna is <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> her lover when she sings lines such as, [...] "When you hold me, I'm alive," [...] and [...] "At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays / I saw the life inside your eyes." [...] The Herald Sun asserted that the lyrics were most likely inspired by Rihanna's private life.|$|E
500|$|A {{pre-season}} injury {{kept him}} out of the entire 1980–81 season, during which time he coached the reserves. In this time he converted Steve Bould from a striker into a centre-back. Smith returned from injury in 1981–82, and featured regularly early in the season, and by the time another injury forced him out of the team, Stoke were sitting in 18th-place. He joined York City, who were struggling in the Fourth Division, on a one-month loan in March 1982. He debuted in a 3–1 home defeat to Hull City on 16 March 1982, and scored once for York, in a 4–2 loss away to Wigan Athletic on 2 April. Smith made seven appearances while on loan at York, and exerted his influence on the team by organising the defence; he commented that [...] "They had been <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> an older head like me". He was recalled by Stoke manager Richie Barker as the defence struggled in his absence, and Smith re-established himself in the team as they avoided relegation. He was handed a free transfer to York in May 1982. He said that if he had been offered a coaching role at Stoke he would have stayed, but that Barker wanted him gone as he saw him as a threat to his position. In total, Smith made 493 appearances for Stoke, a club record for a centre-back.|$|E

500|$|Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic viewed that track, {{along with}} [...] "All of the Lights" [...] and [...] "Power" [...] have [...] "a certain zest of life" [...] to them, adding {{that all three}} tracks were [...] "beautiful". He also commented that [...] "it is great to see that Kanye is still able to have plenty of fun without losing any of his creativity." [...] Dan Vidal of URB commented [...] "sonically, the joy comes from the triumphant, {{painstaking}} arrangement that undoubtedly went into the production". The Washington Posts Chris Richards mused that [...] "the drums come avalanching on Lost in the World", calling it [...] "the grand finale this album deserves." [...] He continued that [...] "West serves up high drama at a breakneck tempo, with pining melodies <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a redemptive moment. But there's no final act of contrition. West is too 'lost in this plastic life.'" [...] Cole Mathew of Slant Magazine described the track as [...] "Kanye's much-anticipated reworking of Bon Iver's [...] "Woods" [...] from his classic EP", and wrote that [...] "it's astounding how he takes the strangest sample on the album and crafts it into a defiantly giddy dance number, complete with tribal drumming in the verses and group choruses that sound massive. It's a mad stroke of brilliance to take Justin Vernon's solitary ode to alienation {{and use it as}} the centerpiece of a catchy, communal reverie. It's experimental, to be sure, but it's also the closest the album comes to pure pop indulgence." [...] The song peaked on the South Korea Gaon Chart at position 104.|$|E

Of environmental lobbyists he stated, [...] "some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are elitists. They've never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels. If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they'd be <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things".|$|E
2500|$|The {{practice}} was {{drawn into the}} national spotlight at that time when Mark Wisdom, a Baptist pastor, responded to what he claims was a vision from God, and challenged the system in the national media. Wisdom claimed that as he prayed, he saw a vision of women in bonds, <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> help. [...] Wisdom claimed to have later discovered these same women {{on one of his}} evangelistic missions, held in bondage in a shrine just across the Volta River from his home, but previously unknown to him. [...] He began publicly denouncing the practice, so much so that headlines in Ghana screamed that he was not afraid of the shrine priests. [...] Wisdom wrote a book on the subject, founded FESLIM (Fetish Slaves Liberation Movement), and was instrumental in some of the earliest liberations, but it was his bold public statements reported in the news that pricked the national consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{has also}} been remixed, with altered lyrics, for {{political}} purposes. It {{has been used in}} Argentina by Florencio Randazzo, Evert Van Tooren and Agustín Rossi for their respective TV advertisements for the 2017 midterm elections. Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro used it to call for voting in the controversial Constitutional Assembly election. Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Erika Ender showed their displeasure with the unauthorized use of the song for political purposes in Venezuela, criticizing Maduro's government and describing the use of the song as [...] "propaganda." [...] Fonsi said that he was never consulted or have he authorized the use of the song for political ends, [...] "less so {{in the context of the}} deplorable situation affecting a country that I love so much as Venezuela." [...] He also stated that his music is [...] "for all of those that want to listen to it and enjoy it, not to use it as propaganda that tries to manipulate the will of the people that are <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> their freedom and a better future." [...] Despite the criticism by the artists, President Maduro continued to use the remix promoting the election, using it during a cadena. On August 16, 2017, English television host James Corden remixed the song to comment on American President Donald Trump during his talk show The Late Late Show with James Corden.|$|E

2500|$|Democrat George Wallace, {{the newly}} elected {{governor}} of Alabama, in January 1963 electrified the white South by <b>crying</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> [...] "Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!". He later stood in the schoolhouse door in a failed attempt to stop federal officials from desegregating the University of Alabama. Wallace communicated traditional conservatism in a populist, anti-elitist and [...] "earthy" [...] language that resonated with rural and working class voters who long {{had been part of}} the New Deal Coalition. He was able to exploit anticommunism, yearnings for [...] "traditional" [...] American values and dislike of civil rights agitators, anti-war protesters and sexual exhibitionists. The Wallace movement did help break away a major element of the New Deal coalition—less educated, powerless low income whites—which decades later made its way into the GOP in the South. He helped pave the way for the conservative backlash of the 1970s and 1980s. However, Wallace did not receive support from Goldwater, Buckley or any mainstream conservative. He did get support from the John Birch Society and the Christian Anti-Communism Crusade. Wallace's populist base of poor white farmers, echoed earlier racist demagogues such as Tom Watson of Georgia. As governor of Alabama (and, when his wife was elected to the governorship, as her husband) Wallace combined his reactionary position on civil rights with relatively liberal programs, such as support for women. Despite this support for state-level government welfare, Wallace did not believe in government intervention in free enterprise and private property. He accused liberals of using the federal government to interfere in [...] "everybody's private business" [...] and as a conservative believed in [...] "freedom for business and labor".|$|E
