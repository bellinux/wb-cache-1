25|$|The {{origin of}} the use of these <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> is not known. It may extend back to the pre Hispanic period, but there are now 16th century chronicles documenting the practice. It may have been a post Conquest invention, after the Spanish {{destroyed}} all other forms of representing the gods. It was easy to carry, mold, make and hide. Many of the religious concepts related to the <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> do have pre Hispanic roots. However, during the colonial period, the Otomi, especially of San Pablito were accused numerous times of witchcraft involving the use of <b>cut</b> <b>outs.</b> Today, some cut out figures are being reinterpreted and sold as handcraft products or folk art, and the use of industrial paper for ritual is common as well. <b>Cut</b> <b>outs</b> made for sale often relate to gods of agriculture, which are less called upon in ritual. These <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> are also not exactly the same as those made for ritual, with changes made {{in order to keep the}} ritual aspect separate.|$|E

Four similar type interplane struts were used between the upper three wings, {{all of which}} had ailerons. The bottom wing had a shorter span with pairs of struts and <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> for the landing gear wheels. Because the axle was the same height as the lower wing, the tailskid was very tall to prevent that wings trailing edge from contacting the ground. When tested in mid 1916 the aircraft had difficulty taking off due to shallow wing incidence and displayed dangerous tendencies {{because of a lack}} of yaw control and a major redesign was required.|$|E
25|$|Level design {{began with}} what {{designer}} Michael Stuart Licht {{referred to as}} spatial studies. Design began with paper <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> of various rooms. Licht would rearrange these rooms until he found a design that he felt worked. The papers had design ideas written on them so that other developers could understand the overall flow of each level. Bubble diagrams were then created which represented main ideas for each space. This was followed by various stages of overview drawings and other drawing studies. 3D level design began after such studies were completed. In-game cinematics were created by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), and marked the first collaboration between LucasArts and ILM. Composer Jeremy Soule wrote music for the game, including both cut scenes and gameplay. The characters Jango Fett and Komari Vosa have their own leitmotifs. Both Temuera Morrison and Leeanna Walsman reprise their roles from the film as Jango Fett and Zam Wesell, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|While the Nahua {{paintings}} {{remain the}} most important craft form related to amate paper, the Otomi have adopted their elaborate cut out figures to the commercial market as well. This began with shamans creating booklets with miniature <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> of gods with handwritten explanations. Eventually, these began to sell and this success led to their commercialization in markets in Mexico City, were the Otomi connected with the Nahua in the 1960s. The Otomi still sell <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> in traditional designs, but have also experimented with newer designs, paper sizes, colors and types of paper.

2500|$|Ritual paper acquires {{a sacred}} value only when shamans cut it ritually. The cutting {{technique}} is most important, not necessarily artistic although many have aesthetic qualities. In San Pablito, the <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> are of gods or supernatural beings {{related to the}} indigenous worldview, but never of Catholic figures. Most of the time, the cut out ceremonies relate to petitions such as good crops and health, although as agriculture declines in importance economically, petitions for health and protection have become more important. One particularly popular ceremony is related to young men who have returned from working abroad. In Chicontepec, there are <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> related to gods or spirits linked to natural phenomena such as lightning, rain, mountains, mangos seeds and more, with those cut from dark paper called [...] "devils" [...] or represent evil spirits. However, figures can also represent people living or dead. [...] Those made of light paper represent good spirits and people who make promises. Female figures are distinguished by locks of hair. Some figures have four arms and two heads in profile, and other have the head and tail of an animal. Those with shoes represent mestizos or bad people who have died in fights, accidents or by drowning, also women who have died in childbirth or children who disrespect their parents. Those without shoes represent indigenous people or good people who have died in sickness or old age. Bad spirits represented in dark paper are burned ceremoniously in order to end their bad influence. Those in light paper are kept as amulets.|$|E

2500|$|Like the wing, the {{fuselage}} and empennage of the J23 were wooden [...] structures. [...] The elliptical cross section fuselage consisted of pre-shaped, stress bearing plywood panels around a light framework of frames and stringers. The pilot's open cockpit was just aft of the trailing edge, {{from where he}} could see both over the wing and through the narrow gap between wing and fuselage. The six cylinder BMW IIIa engine had a fixed pair of machine gun over it in the forward fuselage and its honeycomb radiator was in the nose, with the propeller shaft set low. This was a high compression engine which could only develop full power at altitude, enabling the J23 to fly high and fast. Its top speed was claimed to be [...] at [...] but [...] at [...] The [...] m/22 [...] were synchronized, firing through the propeller. At the rear the ply covered fin was surprisingly small and low, though the fabric covered rudder extended down to the keel. The rudder carried a trim tab.

2500|$|In {{the latter}} 20th century, {{a number of}} artists tried {{to bring back the}} {{technique}} as an art form. Painter and tapestry weaver Carmen Padin began researching the technique after hearing Fernando Gamboa lament its loss. From 1979 to 1981, she exhibited her work in various cities of Mexico which included robes, capes, shields and collages. However, she had to stop by the 1990s because of the difficultly of obtaining feathers. Josefina Ortega Salcedo became attracted to the technique after reading about it in the Artes de México magazine. She studied drawing and painting at the Academy of San Carlos with the goal of applying them to feather work. Her most valuable work in this medium includes several portraits, copied from photographs with precision. Her images are placed on a base of light-colored feathers with the images arranged using crepe paper <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> and colored feathers. [...] However, she, too, no longer works with this technique. Those who still continue to work with it include Elena Sanchez Garrido, who combines feather work and watercolors, and Tita Bilbaro who makes Aztec and modern style images using feathers, sand, fabric, leather, mirrors an sea shells. In the late 1980s she exhibited her work in Mexico City and several places in northern Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|E
