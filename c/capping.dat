5|$|The {{synthesis}} of oligonucleotide phosphorothioates (OPS, see below) {{does not involve}} the oxidation with I2/water, and, respectively, does not suffer from the side reaction described above. On the other hand, if the <b>capping</b> step is performed prior to sulfurization, the solid support may contain the residual acetic anhydride and N-methylimidazole left after the <b>capping</b> step. The <b>capping</b> mixture interferes with the sulfur transfer reaction, which results in the extensive formation of the phosphate triester internucleosidic linkages {{in place of the}} desired PS triesters. Therefore, for the {{synthesis of}} OPS, it is advisable to conduct the sulfurization step prior to the <b>capping</b> step.|$|E
5|$|A 900,000‑year‑long {{period of}} {{quiescence}} followed after the felsic shield-building stage, {{during which time}} erosion ate away at the shield's gentle slopes. This quiescence {{was followed by a}} mafic <b>capping</b> stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago, but renewed activity might have occurred in the last 340,000years. Alkali olivine basalts of the mafic <b>capping</b> stage were derived from the fractionation of a clinopyroxene, olivine and oxide assemblage. However, the associated hawaiite lavas may have derived from an alkali olivine basalt parent by the fractionation of a clinopyroxene-dominated assemblage at higher pressures. As volcanic activity waned during the mafic <b>capping</b> stage, lava flows became more viscous and decreased in volume. This suggests that parental magmas may have been derived by increasingly smaller degrees of partial melting with time. If volcanic activity of the Itcha Range is related to a hotspot, this temporal and spatial evolution would suggest a waning heat source.|$|E

2500|$|Inside the {{business}} <b>caps</b> are expressed most often by simply the three numbers involved that signify each <b>cap.</b> For example, a 5/1 Hybrid ARM {{may have a}} <b>cap</b> structure of 5/2/5 (5% initial <b>cap,</b> 2% adjustment <b>cap</b> and 5% lifetime <b>cap)</b> and insiders would call this a 5-2-5 <b>cap.</b> [...] Alternatively, a 1-year ARM might have a 1/1/6 <b>cap</b> (1% initial <b>cap,</b> 1% adjustment <b>cap</b> and 6% lifetime <b>cap)</b> known as a 1-1-6, or alternatively expressed as a 1/6 <b>cap</b> (leaving out one digit signifies that the initial and adjustment <b>caps</b> are identical).|$|R
5|$|During the mafic <b>capping</b> stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small {{parasitic}} cones, tuff rings and fissures {{in the eastern}} half of the shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially as shown by a wide range in the degree of vesicularity, freshness and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each parasitic cone produced three or four lava flows from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, but the tops of the lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic <b>capping</b> stage, occurring mostly {{at the southern end of}} the Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that phosphoramidites activated with 1H-tetrazole react, to a small extent, with the O6 position of guanosine. Upon oxidation with I2 /water, this side product, possibly via O6-N7 migration, undergoes depurination. The apurinic sites thus formed are readily cleaved {{in the course of}} the final deprotection of the oligonucleotide under the basic conditions (see below) to give two shorter oligonucleotides thus reducing the yield of the full-length product. The O6 modifications are rapidly removed by treatment with the <b>capping</b> reagent as long as the <b>capping</b> step is performed prior to oxidation with I2/water.|$|E

40|$|Cbl-associated protein (<b>CAP)</b> is an adaptor {{protein that}} plays {{important}} roles in both signal transduction and cytoskeleton rearrangement. Alternative splicing of the gene SORBS 1 results in multiple isoforms of <b>CAP</b> protein. We report here the cloning of 3 new <b>CAP</b> isoforms, <b>CAP</b> 2, <b>CAP</b> 3, and <b>CAP</b> 4, from mouse adipose tissue. RT-PCR analyses reveal that the isoform mRNAs are differentially expressed. <b>CAP</b> 2, <b>CAP</b> 3, and <b>CAP</b> 4 contain a coiled-coil domain. In addition, <b>CAP</b> 4 contains a proline-rich region, part of which exists in <b>CAP</b> 3. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments show that <b>CAP</b> 4 forms a homodimeric complex. While these new isoforms similarly interact with Cbl, they exhibit varied binding specificity toward vinculin. In contrast to <b>CAP</b> 1 and <b>CAP</b> 2, <b>CAP</b> 4 does not interact with vinculin, and <b>CAP</b> 3 binds with low affinity. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrates differential subcellular localization of Myc-tagged <b>CAP</b> isoforms in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. These results suggest that these new isoforms of <b>CAP</b> might play different signaling roles...|$|R

5|$|Parasitic cones of the Itcha Range shield {{were formed}} mainly during the Early Pleistocene mafic <b>capping</b> stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago.

The duration of volcanic activity at these cones can last from hours to years. Parasitic cones of the Itcha Range are small cinder cones situated at the summit and flanks of the shield volcano.|$|E

5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ <b>capping</b> process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E
