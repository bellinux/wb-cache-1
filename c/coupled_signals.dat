Coupling can take different forms as it associates the phase, frequency and/or amplitude of coupled oscillations. These specific forms of coupling are a signature for the underlying network physiology and probably relate to distinct cognitive functions. Here I discuss three caveats in data analysis {{that can lead to}} mistake one specific form of cross-frequency coupling for another: 1, bicoherence assesses the level of phase-amplitude and not of phase-phase coupling as commonly accepted; 2, a test for phase-amplitude coupling can indeed signal phase-frequency coupling when the higher frequency signal is extracted using a too narrow band; 3, An oscillation whose frequency fluctuates may induce spurious amplitude anticorrelations between neighbouring frequency bands.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} controlling positions and forces of multiple redundant manipulators cooperatively handling an ob-ject in a decentralized manner while optimizing a performance in-dex. The authors propose one adaptive and two nonadaptive de-centralized controllers. The adaptive controller is {{able to cope with}} unknown or uncertain physical parameters of the system. The Lya-punov approach proves that this controller not only yields asymp-totic convergence of the position and force errors but also opti-mizes the specified performance index. To improve the transition performance, besides the nonadaptive version of the controller, an implicit decentralized force controller with exponential stability is developed. The controllers realize the force and position controls simultaneously by using coupled force and position signals. The <b>coupled</b> <b>signals</b> distinguish these methods from traditional hybrid controllers in which decoupling of the signals is a must. The de-centralized architectures of all the controllers must be emphasized.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{possibilities}} of proton spectroscopic imaging (1 H-MRSI) {{of the human brain}} at 7 Tesla with adiabatic refocusing pulses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A combination of conventional slice selective excitation and two pairs of slice selective adiabatic refocusing pulses (semi-LASER) results in the formation of an echo from a localized volume. Depending on the used radio frequency (rf) coil efficiency and available rf power, the duration of the adiabatic full passage pulses (AFPs) is adapted to enable echo times down to 50 ms (head coil) or 30 ms (local surface coil). RESULTS: An AFP duration of 5 ms with a corresponding bandwidth of 5. 1 kHz resulted in a chemical shift displacement error of 23 % over 3. 8 ppm at 7 T. Using a local surface coil and an echo time down to 30 ms, we detected not only the three main metabolites (NAA, Cr and Cho), but also <b>coupled</b> <b>signals</b> from myo-inositol and glutamate/glutamine in spectra from 0. 14 cc voxels with linewidths down to 10 Hz in 10 min measurement time.

Based on non-linear auto-regressive models, the proposed method provides a generative and parametric model of the time-varying spectral content of the signals. As this method models the entire spectrum simultaneously, it avoids the pitfalls related to incorrect filtering or the use of the Hilbert transform on wide-band signals. As the model is probabilistic, it also provides a score of the model "goodness of fit" via the likelihood, enabling easy and legitimate model selection and parameter comparison; this data-driven feature is unique to our model-based approach. Using three datasets obtained with invasive neurophysiological recordings in humans and rodents, we demonstrate that these models are able to replicate previous results obtained with other metrics, but also reveal new insights such as the influence of the amplitude of the slow oscillation.

Our definition applies to arbitrary multidimensional vector-valued signals and depends on an aperture function. In this way, the bin-related classic definition of h 2 can be generalized. We show that upon choosing suitable aperture functions the bin-related intuitive definition can be deduced. Special attention is dedicated to the direction of the association index that in general is taken in only one sense. We show that for linearly <b>coupled</b> <b>signals</b> high associations are always bidirectional. As a consequence, high asymmetric nonlinear associations are indicators of nonlinear relations, possibly critical, between the dynamic systems underlying the measured signals.

The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is run in tropical channel mode with the boundaries at 30 N and S constrained to 6 -hourly reanalysis data. Experiments with modified boundary conditions are carried out in which intraseasonal (20 - 100 days) timescales are removed, or in which only the annual and diurnal cycles are retained. Twin runs are used to give an objective measure of the boundary-independant component of the variance in each case. The model captures MJO-like propagating structures and shows greater zonal-wind variance in runs with full boundary conditions. Comparison between experiments indicates that about half the intraseasonal variance can be attributed to boundary influence, and specifically to the presence of an intraseasonal extratropical signal. This signal is associated with stronger correlations between low-level zonal wind precursors in the Pacific sector and Indian Ocean convective events. Temporal coherence between MJO events in the model and the observations is analysed by defining four phases based on convectively <b>coupled</b> <b>signals</b> in the low-level zonal wind.

Besides {{the fact that the}} physical phenomenon is very complex, one of itsmain challenges is the very low signalto- noise ratio of the <b>coupled</b> <b>signals,</b> especially the secondorder interface response fields. From seismics, it is wellknown that anonamously high amplitudes can arise due to amplitude-tuning effects which can occur when a seismic signal travels through a package of thin-layers with appropriate amplifying thickness. Using numerical seismoelectric wave propagation experiments through packages of thin-beds, we show that thin-bed geological settings can improve the signalto-noise ratio of the interface response fields. Whether a certain package of thin-beds results in a net strengthening or weakening of the signal, is determined by the contrast in and the order of the coupling coefficients of the different thin-layer media. Formulated differently, we show that the seismoelectric method is sensitive to the medium parameters of thin-bed geological structures far below the seismic resolution, and that due to natural strengthening of the seismoelectric interface response signal, the method might be already suitable for certain geological settings.

The HT-coset codes, including Reed-Muller (RM) codes and polar codes as typical examples, can share a pair of encoder and decoder with implementation complexity of order O(N N). However, to guarantee that all codes with designated rates perform well, HT-coset coding usually requires a sufficiently large code length, which in turn causes difficulties in the determination of which bits are better for being frozen. In this paper, we propose to transmit short HT-coset codes in the so-called block Markov superposition transmission (BMST) manner.

A laboratory measurement setup is built to characterise the signal coupling paths and their coupling strengths. A new concept, the receiving mutual impedance, is introduced to measure the <b>coupled</b> <b>signals</b> between the phased array elements. Measured values of the receiving mutual impedances for a typical two-element surface-coil array are obtained and used in other experiments to find the uncoupled voltages from the received voltages. Results show that the new decoupling method is both accurate and robust over a wide frequency range. Comparison of the uncoupled voltages with the actual ideal uncoupled voltages confirms that if {{the position of the}} signal source is known, almost error-free uncoupled voltages can be obtained. The errors resulted from a change of the position of the signal source are also measured and it is found that they generally increase with the deviation of the signal source from its position where the receiving mutual impedances are measured. The maximum % error of the uncoupled voltages is found to be below 10 % when the signal source changes its position over a distance of half the length of a surface coil. Over this distance change, the signal isolation between the two surface coils is found to be at least 20 dB, whereas the maximum is more than 300 dB.
