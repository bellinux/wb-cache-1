2500|$|Macrosphenidae: African warblers such as longbills and <b>crombecs,</b> a {{recently}} proposed family whose composition is still uncertain ...|$|R
50|$|The African warblers {{range in}} size from the smaller <b>crombecs,</b> which measure 8 cm in length and weigh as little as 6.5 g, to the Cape grassbird, which {{measures}} 19 - 23 cm in length and the moustached grass warbler which weighs 29 - 40 g. There is considerable difference in appearance between the genera; for example the two grass warblers and Victorin's warbler possess long graduated tails, whereas the <b>crombecs</b> have tails of which barely extend beyond the tail coverts and folded wings.|$|R
50|$|Sylvietta, the <b>crombecs,</b> is a genus of African warblers. Formerly {{placed in}} the massively paraphyletic Sylviidae, it is now {{considered}} {{to belong to a}} newly recognized family found only in Africa, Macrosphenidae.|$|R
50|$|The white-browed <b>crombec</b> (Sylvietta leucophrys) is {{a species}} of African warbler, {{formerly}} placed in the family Sylviidae. The enigmatic Chapin's <b>crombec</b> might be a distinct species, or a subspecies Sylvietta leucophrys chapini of the present species.|$|E
50|$|The Chapin's <b>crombec</b> (Sylvietta leucophrys chapini) is {{an enigmatic}} African warbler, {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} family Sylviidae. It is currently considered a subspecies of the white-browed <b>crombec,</b> but might be a distinct species; too {{little is known about}} it to determine this now with reasonable certainty.|$|E
50|$|The African warblers are insect eaters, {{and take}} a range of insect prey. The longbills and crombecs feed in the canopy and in bushes, either as singles or pairs and {{sometimes}} in small groups, whereas the other species are more terrestrial in their habits. Where two species co-occur, such as the red-faced <b>crombec</b> and the long-billed <b>crombec</b> over parts of their range, niche partitioning occurs, with one species feeding in the canopy and the other species feeding lower down in the bushes and trees. Some species of both <b>crombec</b> and longbill {{have been reported to}} join mixed-species feeding flocks.|$|E
50|$|The long-billed <b>crombec's</b> nest is a large, hanging bag of grasses, spider webs, {{and plant}} fibres, which is {{attached}} to the lower limbs of a tree, often an Acacia. The one to three white eggs are incubated for two weeks to hatching, and the chicks are fed by both parents for another two weeks to fledging. This territorial species is monogamous, pairing for life.|$|R
50|$|Breeding is {{seasonal}} {{and usually}} timed {{to coincide with}} the end of the dry season and beginning of the rainy season; in species with large ranges this can lead to considerable variation as to the exact timing. Information is lacking in many species, but for those that have been studied the African warblers are territorial and monogamous. Nest design varies within the family; the <b>crombecs</b> construct deep pocket shaped nests suspended from a branch; whereas the Victorin's warbler, Cape grassbird and moustached grass warbler construct cup nests weaved from grass.|$|R
50|$|The eremomelas are a genus, Eremomela, of passerines in the cisticola family Cisticolidae. The genus was {{previously}} placed {{with the larger}} Old World warbler family Sylviidae prior to that genus being broken up into several families. The genus contains ten to eleven species, {{all of which are}} found in sub-Saharan Africa. They occupy a range of habitats, from arid scrub to lowland tropical forest. They are intermediate in appearance between <b>crombecs</b> and apalis, and measure between 8.5 to(-) 12 cm in length. The sexes are alike in size and plumage.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} {{of this family}} {{are considered to be}} fairly secure and are listed by the IUCN as least concern. One species, the Pulitzer's longbill, is listed as endangered. The species is endemic to forests found on escarpments in western Angola, a habitat threatened by forest clearance and the spread of slash and burn agriculture, and the population is thought to number less than a thousand and is still declining. Another potential concern is Chapin's <b>crombec,</b> which is either a species or a subspecies of the white-browed <b>crombec.</b> The status of this is uncertain, as conflict has prevented surveys in its range, but it may be extinct.|$|E
50|$|The red-faced <b>crombec</b> (Sylvietta whytii) is {{a species}} of African warbler, {{formerly}} placed in the family Sylviidae.It is found in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, and subtropical or tropical dry shrubland.|$|E

5000|$|Chimfunshi is {{recognized}} as an “Important Bird Area” (IBA #22). An Important Bird Area is an area recognized as being a globally important habitat {{for the conservation of}} bird populations.

50|$|The African warblers inhabit a {{range of}} {{habitats}} in sub-Saharan Africa. These range from primary rainforest to forest edge and open woodland habitats for the longbills, wooded savanna to arid scrubland and bushland in the crombecs, rocky arid scree areas and grassland for the rockrunner, and grassland for the moustached grass warbler and Cape grassbird. The family is overwhelmingly non-migratory, although the moustached grass warbler and the northern <b>crombec</b> both make some localised movements in West Africa related to the rainy season.|$|E

50|$|It {{is found}} {{only on the}} Lendu Plateau, Democratic Republic of the Congo. It {{was removed from the}} IUCN Red List in 2007 as it is {{considered}} a white-browed <b>crombec</b> subspecies, pending further research. It was previously considered a species of least concern, though actually it has not been encountered for some time, and might even be extinct. However, this is not very likely given the fairly low rates of bird extinctions in Africa - compared to, e.g., South America and Southeast Asia. In any case, the Second Congo War, and especially the Ituri conflict, have completely prevented any effort to relocate these birds.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{temporal and}} spatial effects on (1) overall flock composition, and (2) aspects of the foraging behaviour of three bird species commonly participating in mixed-species flocks in mixed and Acacia woodland across the winter season in South Africa. Foraging observations were compared when birds were alone or with conspecifics, against when in mixed-species flocks. The two habitats differed {{with respect to the}} presence of the Southern Black Tit Parus niger, a leader species in mixed woodland but largely absent from Acacia woodland. Flock species richness within mixed woodland, but not Acacia woodland, increased significantly as the season progressed. Enlarged flock size resulted from a general increase in flocking tendency of all species. At the species level, the Long-billed <b>Crombec</b> Sylvietta rufescens and the Chinspot Batis Batis moli-tor showed clear feeding benefits within flocks, whereas tits obtained no feeding benefit. Crombecs and batises also changed foraging location when entering mixed flocks by converging on the foraging height of tits in mixed woodland and on each other in Acacia woodland. Furthermore, batises and tits showed marked temporal changes in feeding techniques, due to the changing vegetation structure, a fact that should be considered in future flocking studies.
