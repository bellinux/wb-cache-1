Three theoretical perspectives are elaborated in relation to relevant empirical research: <b>children</b> <b>as</b> cosmopolitan actors and world citizens, <b>children</b> <b>as</b> ‘subjects of responsibilization’ in relation to the discourse on sustainable development and <b>children</b> <b>as</b> actors influencing family negotiations about consumption.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} how a Colombian EFL textbooks’ series {{deals with the}} educational discourse of <b>children</b> <b>as</b> subjects with rights andthe new conception of childhood from a Rights Perspective, taking into account UNICEF’s conclusions on the current situation of children’srights in Colombia where children are being silenced, discriminated against, and exploited by social practices as such. Using Critical DiscourseAnalysis tools this paper identifies different discourse strategies related to an educational discourse of <b>children</b> <b>as</b> rights-bearing subjects. The results show three main discourse strategies that reveal the way EFL textbooks tend to portray <b>children</b> <b>as</b> members of society: genderand racial visibility, human being’s passivity, and value- system inclusion. Although the EFL textbooks {{address some of the}} principles thatsupport the educational discourse of <b>children</b> <b>as</b> subjects with rights, they still have the tendency to represent <b>children</b> <b>as</b> passive subjectsand non-right holders...|$|R

5|$|In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} a second creative drought, {{brought on by}} bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms. Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led to a medical diagnosis of neurasthenia. Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household {{may have been a}} factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths of his mother and youngest <b>child,</b> <b>as</b> well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently. After making third versions of the musical tableau Sadko and the opera The Maid of Pskov, he closed his musical account with the past; he had left none of his major works before May Night in their original form.|$|E
5|$|In India, a 14th-century Indian text {{mentioning}} {{a lesbian}} couple {{who had a}} <b>child</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of their}} lovemaking is an exception to the general silence about female homosexuality. This invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled Fire in 1996, prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by extremists. Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence, but most discourse on homosexuality centers on men. Women's rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian issues in their platforms, as lesbians and material focusing on female homosexuality are frequently suppressed.|$|E

The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art, along with a similar work, a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin.

Historians dispute King Henry VIII's paternity of {{one or both of}} Mary Boleyn's children born during this marriage. Henry VIII: The King and His Court, by Alison Weir, questions the paternity of Henry Carey; Dr. G.W. Bernard (The King's Reformation) and Joanna Denny (Anne Boleyn: A New Life of England's Tragic Queen) argue that Henry VIII was their father. Henry did not acknowledge either <b>child,</b> <b>as</b> he did his son Henry Fitzroy, his illegitimate son by Elizabeth Blount, Lady Talboys.|$|E
