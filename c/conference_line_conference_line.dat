40|$|The {{overseas}} freight {{bill for}} New Zealand is estimated {{for the year}} ending 30 June 1980 to be $ 1. 2 billion. The burden of this freight charge predominantly falls on New Zealand exporters and importers. Since a high portion of this 	charge is incurred in foreign exchange, the escalating sea freight bill contributes significantly to New Zealand's poor 	balance of payments position. The paper addresses a number of questions: Q 1. 	Have shipping freight rates increased faster than other costs in our economy? The {{answer to this question}} is yes. Q 2. 	What has led to such high freight rate increases? The answer to this question is associated {{with a high level of}} capital invested in cellular containerships over the past decade and the increasing cost of oil based fuels. There would appear to have been few productivity gains to compensate for such increased costs. Q 3. How do these freight rate increases affect farm gate returns? The answer to this question is that any increase in sea freight rates results in a corresponding drop in farm gate returns. Q 4. 	What are the arguments for and against sole use of the <b>Conference</b> <b>Lines?</b> Seven arguments used in support of sole use are detailed. Two arguments used by those opposed to exclusive use of the <b>Conference</b> <b>Lines</b> follow. In my opinion the balance of argument favours those opposed to sole use but more investigation is required before a specific policy change can be recommended. Q 5. 	What course of action should be pursued? Producer Boards and Government Departments must put New Zealand in a position of strength by investigating alternative shipping systems in a serious manner. Over the next year or so every support should be given to those who are probing the present shipping system...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{customer}} {{products like}} vehicles do not only contain mechanical parts {{but also a}} highly complex software and their manufacturers have to offer many variants of technically very similar systems with sometimes only small differences in their behavior. The proper reuse of software artifacts which realize this behavior using a software product line is discussed in recent literature and appropriate methods and techniques for their management are proposed. However, establishing a software product line for integrating already existing legacy software to reuse valuable resources for future similar products is very company-specific. In this paper, a method is outlined for evaluating objectively a legacy software's potential to create a software product line. This method is applied to several development projects at Volkswagen AG Business Unit Braunschweig to evaluate the software product line potential for steering systems.

40|$|Hierarchically {{decomposed}} component-based {{system development}} reduces design complexity by supporting distribution {{of work and}} component reuse. For product line development, the variability of the components to be deployed in different products has to be represented by appropriate means. In this paper, we propose hierarchical variability modeling which allows specifying component variability integrated with the component hierarchy and locally to the components. Components can contain variation points determining where components may vary. Associated variants define how this variability can be realized in different component configurations. We present a meta model for hierarchical variability modeling to formalize the conceptual ideas. In order to obtain an implementation of the proposed approach together with tool support, we extend the existing architectural description language MontiArc with hierarchical variability modeling. We illustrate the presented approach using an example from the automotive systems domain. Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures.
