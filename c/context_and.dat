40|$|Abstract. There is a {{commonly}} accepted need for <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> ontologies {{to describe the}} vast amounts of data {{that are available to}} pervasive computing applications. Existing <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> ontologies are either very generalised, very application specific, or inflexible. An integrated approach is required in which new concepts can be added and related to existing ones transparently. This paper describes a novel approach to the design of a set of <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> ontologies for context-aware pervasive computing systems. It describes a Query Service, that lies between applications and contextual information, which complemented by the <b>contexts</b> <b>and</b> ontologies, offers a more powerful query answering service to application developers than is currently available. ...|$|R

5|$|Surprisingly, {{variations}} {{in the interpretation of}} the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine.

5|$|Throughout {{their school}} years, {{children}} {{continue to build}} their vocabulary. In particular, children begin to learn abstract words. Beginning around age 3–5, word learning takes place both in conversation and through reading.

The phonological loop and serial order short-term memory may both {{play an important role}} in vocabulary development.|$|E
5|$|An {{outgrowth}} of Jackson's trip was {{the realization that}} the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery contextually in its battlefield displays and presentations. Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues, Jackson felt racial <b>context</b> <b>and</b> relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way. As a result, in 2000, he recrafted the United States Department of the Interior's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt use his influence over the superintendents of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations.|$|E

Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by <b>context</b> <b>and</b> rhythm.

5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, the new {{administration}} was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially {{over the issue of}} land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian diplomats, and ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals was made possible by the international <b>context,</b> <b>and</b> former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general {{views of}} {{vocabulary}} development argue that {{children do not}} need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word-world mappings. Instead, word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience, association, and frequency. Children are thought to notice the objects, actions, or events that are most salient in <b>context,</b> <b>and</b> then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence. Additionally, research on word learning suggests that fast mapping, the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information, is not specific to word learning. Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact, remembering both words and facts after a time delay.|$|E
5|$|Historic {{districts are}} {{generally}} {{two types of}} properties, contributing and non-contributing. Broadly defined, a contributing property is any property, structure or object which adds to the historical integrity or architectural qualities that make a historic district, listed locally or federally, significant. Different entities, usually governmental, at {{both the state and}} national level in the United States, have differing definitions of contributing property but they all retain the same basic characteristics. In general, contributing properties are integral parts of the historic <b>context</b> <b>and</b> character of a historic district.|$|E

In that year, Rescue 1122 was launched as a professional pre-hospital emergency service, and it has managed to achieve an average response time of 7 minutes, comparable to that of developed nations. Some of the critical factors in its success included local manufacture of vehicles, training instructors to certify emergency medical technicians, adopting training materials to the local <b>context,</b> <b>and</b> branching out to include fire and rescue service response under a united command structure.|$|E
5|$|Passport to Pimlico {{explores the}} spirit and unity of wartime London in a post-war <b>context</b> <b>and</b> offers an {{examination}} of the English character. Like other of the Ealing comedies, the film pits a small group of British against a series of changes to the status quo from an external agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, the baby was born on Dutch territory, and would not lose her right to the throne.|$|E
5|$|The Greek {{text on the}} Rosetta Stone {{provided}} the starting point.

Thus, the earliest translations of the Greek text of the stone show the translators still struggling with the historical <b>context</b> <b>and</b> with administrative and religious jargon. Stephen Weston verbally presented an English translation of the Greek text at a Society of Antiquaries meeting in April 1802.|$|E
