40|$|Determining {{the factors}} which make a {{difference}} between a custodial sentence and a <b>community</b> <b>penalty</b> {{is one of the}} most challenging decisions for sentencers. Little research to date has explored the nature of public reaction to mitigating factors and the circumstances which may justify imposition of a <b>community</b> <b>penalty</b> even though the custodial threshold has been crossed. This article reports findings from a representative survey of the British public. Respondents were asked a series of questions designed to explore public reaction to sentencing cases at the custodial threshold. Public opinion polls suggest that the public respond punitively at sentencing, and have little sympathy for mitigating factors relating to the offender. In a series of questions, using experimental manipulations, respondents demonstrated considerable flexibility when sentencing cases near the custodial threshold. Significant support emerged for a wide range of mitigating factors at sentencing. The strength of public support for custody as a sanction was also explored by providing respondents who had imposed a term of imprisonment a possible alternative <b>community</b> <b>penalty.</b> Significant proportions of respondents found the alternative acceptable, even for relatively serious offences. © The Author(s) 2011...|$|E

40|$|The idea {{of dealing}} with {{offenders}} in the community rather than sending them to prison has a long history. We have moved {{far away from the}} pre-eighteenth century era where punishment meant punishing the body to the eighteenth and nineteenth century where offenders were segregated from their communities often putting them into prisons, which {{is still one of the}} dominant forms of punishment in the present days. From late nineteenth century until now, we can observe a move towards punishing and controlling offenders in the community. Basically, the <b>community</b> <b>penalties</b> started its journey as providing „alternative to custody ‟ measures aimed at the welfare and therapy of offenders outside the prison walls. This rationale provided base for the sentencing practices for quite a long time. However, during 1970 s, this rational came under attack from some research evidences suggesting that rehabilitation programmes are ineffective in reducing offending.

Its aim was to use the views of lay magistrates, probation staff, offenders and victims (the four research groups) to investigate normative questions raised by penal theorists. The study comprised the following stages: stage 1 : 'Exploring Punishment as Communication': first round interviews - 63 individuals were interviewed in total; 21 magistrates, 19 probation officers, 13 offenders and 10 victims; stage 2 : 'Adding Quantitative Weight': 771 questionnaires were completed by respondents drawn from the same four groups, but across five counties; stage 3 : Follow-up interviews: these were arranged with twelve individuals (three magistrates, three offenders, three victims and two probation officers) whose views reflected the range emerging from questionnaire analysis. In fact, eleven follow-up interviews were eventually conducted, as only two of the three interviews with 'victims' took place. These follow-up interviews provided an opportunity to discuss specific questions raised in earlier analysis, using hypothetical examples to probe an issue in depth. evaluation of Community Service (CS) Pathfinder Projects.

40|$|What are the Obstacles to a Rational Criminal Justice Policy? It {{is often}} {{wondered}} {{why we do}} not have a more rational, evidence-based system of criminal justice. All the evidence points towards a more targeted use of imprisonment, a joined up system of criminal and social justice and improved resourcing for <b>community</b> <b>penalties</b> and <b>community</b> services. Yet a key reason which prevents justice policy from proceeding rationally is the fear of looking ‘soft’ in the eyes of the public. People feel let down and angry about a system which seems uninterested in showing justice to be done, publicly recognising the wrong, encouraging the wrong-doer to to face up to the wrong, and make amends. Is there any way out of this policy quandary? Here we propose that a key public frustration, which drives cynicism and penal populism, lies in the failure of criminal justice to engage, and be seen to engage, in emotionally-intelligent communication. Too often the process appears sterile, lacking emotional meaning and participation. Mention of ‘emotion’ in law sometimes rings alarm bells. Our argument, however, is that emotionally-intelligent communication is not opposed to, but essential to, rational and progressive policy...|$|R
40|$|In post-referendum Scotland it {{is widely}} {{suggested}} {{that this may be}} a moment to move away from Scotland’s relatively heavy use of imprisonment. In its efforts to reduce radically the prison population there seems to be real intent by the Scottish Government to shift the emphasis from prison to <b>community</b> <b>penalties.</b> To try to achieve this, the Government has deemed it necessary first to restrict mandatory community support for and supervision of long term prisoners - a move which could make the overall task more difficult. Currently the major tool in the Government’s reform box seems to be the extension of the presumption against ‘ineffective’ and ‘unnecessary’ short custodial sentences. But will such an extension work? This paper argues that the extension of the presumption is likely to have little impact by itself. Additional options include: relinquishing the policy of ‘custody as a last resort’ and instead making other penalties ‘the ultimate sanction’ (including for breach); creating a public principle which ensures that no one goes to prison for want of anything to address their needs; more creative use of Electronic Monitoring; making certain kinds of cases normally non-imprisonable...|$|R

Yet even if consent is not formally required, there is reason to think that England and Wales is an example of a country where in practice consent is actively sought.

It is concluded that a formal expression of consent in Court has symbolic value, but does not resolve the challenge of trying to secure consent and cooperation that must persist throughout the duration of the community order...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{trends in}} criminal justice and penal policy {{over the past}} 25 years. This period has been characterized as a time of penal populism, which originated in {{the failure of the}} 1991 Criminal Justice Act, and the competition between the main political parties to be ‘tough on crime’. However, this is not the only trend to be found in penal policy. There has continued to be a strong undertow of support for rehabilitation and <b>community</b> <b>penalties,</b> including restorative justice. There has been pressure from the left as much as the right to take domestic violence, sexual offences against women and children and hate crimes more seriously. There have been pressures to meet performance targets – which gradually transformed into calls to build the legitimacy of the justice system. Finally there have been pressures to privatize criminal justice agencies. These various impulses have sometimes amplified and sometimes counteracted the pressures towards tough penal policy. If the period of intense penal populism ran from 1993 to 2007, inertia in the system has ensured that there have been no significant attempts to row back from tough policies, and to reassert the values of penal parsimony. Given that money has been tight since 2007 and crime has continued to fall, this must amount to a lost opportunity of significant proportions...|$|R
40|$|Book synopsis: Questions of {{legitimacy}} {{and issues of}} compliance {{lie at the heart}} of criminal justice systems and policies. Recent years have seen greater recognition and awareness of the essential role {{of legitimacy}}, trust and public confidence in underpinning the effectiveness of criminal justice practices and institutions. As such, experiences and perceptions of legitimacy have direct implications for compliance, whilst securing public compliance remains a pivotal challenge for systems of crime control. Exploring the hitherto neglected links between legitimacy and compliance raises crucial questions about the effectiveness of criminal justice and point to ways in which both elements might be enhanced. This book brings together leading international scholars to consider a number of connected themes relating to compliance, legitimacy and trust in different areas of criminal justice and social regulation. It presents an inter-disciplinary dialogue and debate that combines insights from criminology, psychology and socio-legal studies drawing together conceptual analysis with empirical research findings in relation to policing, anti-social behaviour interventions, <b>community</b> <b>penalties,</b> electronic monitoring, imprisonment and tax avoidance. In so doing, the book presents advances in theory and conceptual understandings of compliance and legitimacy within systems of crime control. The contributors highlight the importance of normative and social dimensions to compliance as well as the constructive role played by experiences of procedural fairness and legitimacy in systems of justice. This cutting-edge collection of essays will be invaluable reading for all those interested in thinking critically about the future of criminal justice policies and practices including academics, researchers and criminal justice practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Community {{justice in}} Scotland – {{the system of}} {{agencies}} that deliver community punishments and related services – is being restructured {{for the second time}} in a decade. The current system of administration by regional Community Justice Authorities (CJAs) will be replaced by a two-tier model, with local planning passing to Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs) and a new national body providing leadership for the sector. This thesis, the only empirical study of the restructuring, draws on interviews with politicians and practitioners to analyse the policy, its historical background and the ways in which – without directly affecting practice – it connects to major questions about Scottish politics and penal policy. Using the theoretical concept of the ‘penal field’, the thesis discusses the effects on community justice of struggle and compromise between Scottish local and national government. The birth of CJAs from this compromise caused them to be structurally flawed, but they were nonetheless not without certain achievements. Community justice is also considered in relation to historical narratives of a distinctive Scottish penal identity, and efforts to reaffirm it by reorienting the justice system towards <b>community</b> <b>penalties</b> rather than prison. Recent scholarship which highlights the role of local democratic structures in penal policy informs an analysis of CPPs (whose limited success has produced concern about their ability to fulfil justice responsibilities) and the relationship between their development (including the recent Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act) and the community justice redesign; the thesis argues that the community justice and community empowerment agendas are being allowed to converge but not meet. The new system, it is argued, is another structurally flawed compromise. The proliferation of agencies will likely hinder partnership working, while the new national body will have little power to fulfil some difficult and complex responsibilities around legitimacy and accountability. The policy will disrupt lines of communication despite efforts to smooth the transition, and the length of its development has already caused disruption. The restructuring, it is further argued, is insufficient to fulfil a deeply felt need for major reorientation of Scotland’s penal field...|$|R
40|$|Although {{most of the}} {{research}} on alternatives to incarceration has been methodologically flawed, the aggregate conclusion is that the promise of alternatives has not been met. Most alternatives programs have not worked with truly prison-bound offenders, and as a result, have 2 ̆ 2 increased the net of social control. 2 ̆ 2 North Carolina 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Community</b> <b>Penalties</b> Act of 1983 created alternative sentence planning programs for certain nonviolent prison-bound offenders. The purposes of this study were to examine this legislation and its assumptions, to study its implementation by one of five authorized programs, and, by evaluating (with a randomized experimental design) the program 2 ̆ 7 s impact on sentencing decisions, to test the law 2 ̆ 7 s assumption that such programs can affect prison commitments. The study found {{that a majority of the}} defendants eligible for service were prison-bound. When the experimentals 2 ̆ 7 and controls 2 ̆ 7 prison sentences were compared as a whole, significantly fewer experimentals received active prison sentences of 12, 24, and 36 months or more. Overall mean sentence lengths did not differ; however, with outliers excluded, experimentals received significantly less active time. The two groups were subdivided as high-risk (statistically predicted to receive an active sentence of 12 months or more) and low-risk (statistically predicted to receive a sentence of less than 12 months). The low-risk defendants in the experimental and control groups did not differ significantly on any measure of sentence outcome. However, the high-risk experimentals, when compared with high-risk controls, received significantly fewer active sentences and more sentences of probation, as well as fewer sentences of 6, 12, 24, and 36 months or more. The results above illustrate the study 2 ̆ 7 s most salient implication. That is, the program apparently had much more effect on sentences of high-risk defendants [...] defendants that the program was designed to serve [...] than it had on the sentences of low-risk defendants. Prison commitments were significantly reduced for this group. These results support the contention that alternative sentence planning programs should concentrate on higher risk defendants and rely on their own selection of clients based on objective criteria, rather than attorney referrals that tend to widen the net of social control. ...|$|R
