Through hydrodynamic analysis, a hydrodynamic model including three equations has been established, whose solution results in the actual gas velocity, particle velocity and bed voidage in the recycle chamber. The model also predicts the solids flow rate, gas flow rate and pressure drop in both standpipe and recycle chamber.

50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>valve</b> {{spring system}} is {{satisfactory}} for traditional mass-produced engines {{that do not}} rev highly and are of a design that requires low maintenance. At the period of initial desmodromic development, valve springs were a major limitation on engine performance because they would break from metal fatigue. Vacuum melt processes developed in the 1950s helped remove impurities in the steel used to make valve springs, although after sustained operation above 8000 RPM often springs would still fail. The desmodromic system was devised to remedy this problem. Furthermore, as maximum RPM increases, higher spring force is required to prevent valve float, leading to increased cam drag and higher wear on the parts at all speeds, problems addressed by the desmodromic mechanism.|$|E

40|$|The {{atrioventricular}} canal defect {{is a rare}} congenital cardiac anomaly that exists in a partial and complete form. The cardiac defects that may occur in the septum primum of the atrium, the ventricular septum, and the atrioventricular valves are secondary to abnormal endocardial cushion development in the heart. This case report describes a 6 week old female thoroughbred foal with a complete {{atrioventricular canal}} defect. 	Electrocardiography, echocardiography, and intracardiac pressure measurements were utilized to characterize the defect and its hemodynamic consequences. An atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and a <b>common</b> atrioventricular <b>valve</b> were identified. The <b>common</b> AV <b>valve</b> consisted of five leaflets with two free-floating bridging leaflets in the center. The foal was euthanized and a necropsy was performed, which confirmed the anatomic anomalies.

40|$|SUMMARY We have {{analysed}} the atrioventricular junction, ventricular mass, and ventriculoarterial junction in 43 hearts with isomeric atrial chambers. Of the hearts, 32 had atrial {{chambers of}} bilateral right morphology while 11 had atrial chambers with bilateral left atrial characteristics. Among the hearts with right atrial isomerism, there were 13 biventricular hearts, all with ambiguous atrioventricular connection. Eight had a <b>common</b> <b>valve</b> and five had two atrioventricular valves. In the other 19 hearts, the atrial chambers {{were connected to}} only one ventricular chamber, 18 having double inlet ventricle through a <b>common</b> <b>valve</b> and the other having absence of the left atrioventricular connection.

40|$|IntroductionFew studies {{investigated}} the long-term outcome {{of patients with}} univentricular heart and <b>common</b> atrioventricular <b>valve.</b> MethodWe retrospectively analysed the medical files of all patients univentricular heart with <b>common</b> atrioventricular <b>valve</b> {{in the setting of}} heterotaxy or with unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect preventing biventricular repair. Results 117 patients were identified during the study period. 89 / 117 had a postnatal diagnosis. 28 / 117 patients never underwent surgery, 25 / 117 underwent one palliation surgery (Blalock-Taussig-shunt (BTS) / pulmonary banding), and finally, 61 / 117 patients entered a sequential cavopulmonary connection program: 37 / 61 had partial cavopulmonary connection at the time of data analysis while 24 / 61 had total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC). The average age at TCPC was 7. 6 years +/- 4 years [1. 7 - 16 years]. Three patients were eventually transplanted. The overall mortality was 59 % (69 / 117) : 65 % and 30 % in heterotaxy and in patients with unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect respectively. Mortality was 85 % (24 / 28) in the subgroup of patients who never underwent surgery, 93 % in the subgroup of patients who had a BTS, and 89 % after pulmonary banding. In the subgroup planed to have TCPC, 49 % died after partial cavopulmonary connection and survival rate was 71. 6 % [50. 7 - 100] in patients who had TCPC. ConclusionThe long-term outcome of univentricular hearts with <b>common</b> atrioventricular <b>valve</b> treated in a tertiary referral center showed a high mortality rate. Patients with this kind of complex congenital heart disease should undergo the sequential univentricular program without delay in order to obtain better long-term survival...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Aortic {{stenosis}} (AS) is a <b>common</b> <b>valve</b> {{disease in}} octogenarians. Previous {{studies have shown}} that aortic valve replacement (AVR) is frequently not performed in these patients. This study investigated the incidence, determinants, and prognostic impact of AVR refusal or denial in these patients. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2007, 163 octogenarians (mean age, 84 ± 3 years) with severe AS and an indication for operation according to guidelines were prospectively included in an echocardiographic registry. Among these, 97 underwent AVR, and 66 were treated conservatively. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis identified older age, a lower transaortic pressure gradient, a larger aortic valve area, and the presence of diabetes as independent predictors of AVR refusal or denial. Patients who underwent AVR had a 30 -day mortality of 9...|$|E
