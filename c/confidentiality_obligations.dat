Confidentiality {{has been}} {{regarded}} as an essential attribute of arbitration over litigation due to its “private and confidential” nature in arbitral proceedings. Such attribute of arbitration has been subject to debates over recent years from different scholars {{in the world of}} arbitration. Two common law jurisdictions have been the result of such debates. The United Kingdom (England) who has for decades assumed the existence of an implied <b>obligation</b> of <b>confidentiality</b> in its arbitration proceedings while Australia has rejected such an implied obligation and have held that confidentiality is not an essential attribute of arbitration. In Tanzania, the current arbitration laws are silent with respect to confidentiality provisions {{and there seems to be}} no literature or any article written on the subject matter. This dissertation therefore aims to introduce the doctrine of confidentiality in Tanzania by examining the two common law approaches case-to-case basis and to show how a developing nation like Tanzania could implement one or combination of the different approaches into its arbitration system. Chapter 1 introduces the doctrine of confidentiality in arbitral proceedings by examining how different scholars have interpreted the concept and by distinguishing the doctrine from privacy.

40|$|The thesis "Limitations of {{professional}} liability {{in relation to}} the professions of auditor, tax adviser and accountant with regard to the duty of confidentiality" focuses on a more detailed elaboration of the selected specific segment {{of professional}} liability of the given professions, on the legal and ethical obligations in the field of confidentiality and the possibility of its breaking. The introductory part of the thesis deals with confidentiality in terms of historical development and its importance in the present. Further, it outlines the area of moral and ethical responsibility, legal liability in general, and confidentiality as a specific duty. The concept of confidentiality of the professions of auditors, tax advisers and accountants represents the core of the presented work. The duty of confidentiality of the profession of auditors is significantly influenced by the public interest in the presented information in the form of opinion on the financial statements of the audited entities, and thus the possibilities of the legally supported breaking of this obligation are the most extensive, as evidenced by the amendment to the Act on Auditors, effective from 1 October 2016. The duty of confidentiality of the tax adviser has until recently been strictly defined on a legal basis. The change was brought by the Supreme Court's case law in November 2015, which by comparing the principally equivalent conditions for the exercise of legal liability in the area of confidentiality of the tax adviser and attorney, also deduces the similarities of competencies of both professions in cases of breaking the confidentiality. The accounting profession is not regulated by law, and therefore the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>obligation</b> is also not legally enforceable. However, professional certified accountants are required to comply with the Code of Conduct issued by the Professional Chamber. The final part of the thesis focuses on comparing the duty of confidentiality of the selected professions of auditors, tax advisers and professional accountants with the attorney-at-law profession...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} auditors’ reporting duty {{to public}} authorities. It studies auditors’ reporting duties in Swedish Companies Act, Finnish government’s proposals HE 212 / 2014 and HE 254 / 2014 and EU Regulation 537 / 2014. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyze whether financial crime prevention activities, such as the auditors’ reporting duty, should be considered as a part of auditors’ duties. In addition, this paper analyzes how the reporting duties are justified in preliminary works of passed legislation and legal literature. This paper also analyzes what kind of impact reporting duties have in auditor’s role. The paper’s methodology is legal dogmatics and also legal comparison is made between above mentioned legal norms. When I assess the Finnish government proposals and the Swedish reporting duty, the perspective is partly legal politics. Auditor’s active reporting duty to authorities is internationally understood as whistle-blowing. Its significance has increased especially after financial scandals. As a result there have been public ambitions to incorporate auditors more closely in the fight against financial crime. However, auditing is not an authoritative position but a position of trust, where auditors primarily work on behalf of company shareholders by monitoring their investment. Besides this, auditing also has a wider societal role in securing the correctness of financial information. Auditors’ whistle-blowing duties may be perceived as a response to the failure of the state to develop adequate public crime prevention mechanisms for corporations. For auditing profession whistle-blowing duties can be seen as problematic, especially due to the profession’s own ethical principles. As stated in the paper, the whistle-blowing duties require auditors to breach their client <b>confidentiality</b> <b>obligation</b> and thus harm auditors’ position as an independent party. Auditor’s independence and client confidentiality are central axioms for plausible auditing. However, these principles are not absolute and they yield when an important public interest is at stake. The paper shows that auditor’s whistle-blowing duties are problematic as they increase the audit risk and thus the audit fees. Such duties also obscure auditor’s main task and do not necessarily reach the most flagrant cases. A general whistle-blowing duty is problematic for both auditors’ and audited companies’ legal security. Although auditors conduct legality surveillance, this paper concludes that auditor’s reporting duties to authorities should be limited to exceptions. General rules should be avoided...|$|R
40|$|Lawyers often leave a {{practice}} setting {{and move to}} a new practice as their career paths advance or change. The incidence of lawyer migration has increased dramatically in the past decade, as law firms recruit more lateral hires and offer fewer partnership opportunities to their associates. As a lawyer prepares to change employment settings, her prospective new law firm asks her about the clients she has represented in the past. The new law firm must insist on this information, for without it the firm could not screen for possible conflicts of interest. Were the firm to hire a lawyer without such conflict screening, the new lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 taint 2 ̆ 2 could disqualify the firm from important and lucrative work, and cause great harm to its clients. At the same time, the migrating lawyer owes her clients a strong <b>confidentiality</b> <b>obligation</b> under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the law of lawyering. When the prospective new firm asks for information about her clients, the lawyer faces a delicate quandary. Her career interests and her respect for the new firm 2 ̆ 7 s conflict policies demand that she provide the requested information; her confidentiality duties seem to require her not to reveal her client 2 ̆ 7 s information without their permission. Seeking such permission is often impossible or impractical. This Article investigates this difficult and widespread ethical issue. It begins by identifying five types of information which a new law firm is likely to want from a prospective hire, including information about the prior firm 2 ̆ 7 s work but also financial data regarding the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s client billings. It then looks carefully at the Model Rules, the Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers, and other authority for insights about which disclosures are lawful and which are not. It concludes that the available authority in fact permits surprisingly little information sharing, but argues that the authority ought to permit carefully defined disclosures which will not present hardships or embarrassment to the migrating lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s clients. The Article offers distinctions in information-sharing which can protect the moving lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s client confidences while allowing law firms to protect their clients 2 ̆ 7 interests, and offers protocols for performing conflict checks when a lawyer cannot reveal her client 2 ̆ 7 s identities without causing them some harm. Finally, the Article offers several discrete changes to the Model Rules, which if adopted would provide clarity to lawyers and law firms engaged in the lateral hiring process...|$|R

40|$|We often {{regulate}} actors as a {{proxy for}} protecting categories of information. Rather than directly protect reading records, for example, we target actors like libraries who are likely to possess them. This approach has proven increasingly untenable in the digital age, where the relevant actors are difficult to identify and constantly shifting. Unanticipated third parties now insert themselves as intermediaries or eavesdroppers in all manner of transactions, even in protected spaces like libraries. Where this happens, actor-defined regimes fail to vindicate their privacy commitments even within the institutions for which they were designed. Libraries provide a clear example of this problem. Private reading historically has been protected through a regime that restricts libraries’ ability to exploit reading records. Yet this regime now fails to protect reading records even in libraries because it does not bind third parties who provide library services digitally. Illustrating the point, Amazon facilitates e-book lending for a number of public and academic libraries. Although Amazon collects detailed reading records from patrons utilizing these services, the library confidentiality regime does not restrict what it can do with the records. These patrons accordingly confront the risks to intellectual privacy the library regime was meant to counter. This Article proposes a content-defined approach whereby <b>confidentiality</b> <b>obligations</b> would attach to particular types of information regardless of which actors possessed it. Such an approach would not only save extant confidentiality regimes from obsolescence, but also provide a vehicle for extending privacy commitments to future data practices that implicated the same types of sensitive records...|$|E
40|$|Whichever party wins government, {{procedures}} {{for dealing with}} disputes need to change, writes ANTHONY FORSYTH LABOR’S pledge to abolish the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) along with several other federal agencies {{and replace them with}} a new body, Fair Work Australia, has generated significant debate and media attention. Much of this discussion has focused upon three aspects. First, the “surprise element” of Labor’s move, which involved turning its back on the AIRC after supporting the institution in the face of {{more than a decade of}} government attacks. Secondly, the rationale for this policy shift, most likely emanating from a desire to start again with new appointees given the perception that the government has “stacked” the tribunal with employer representatives. And thirdly, the constitutional validity of the proposal, with concern in some quarters about the combining of enforcement/prosecution functions and judicial/determination functions within the same body. But there has been very little discussion of the implications of Labor’s announcement for workplace dispute resolution. Before addressing that issue, what has been the experience with dispute resolution in the first year or so of Work Choices? Work Choices effected a fundamental shift from the century-long tradition of compulsory conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes in the AIRC to a framework of voluntary dispute resolution. Parties to workplace disputes now have the option of having them resolved in the AIRC, or using private alternative dispute resolution (ADR) providers such as mediators and arbitrators. The AIRC’s dispute resolution powers are now very limited. It can no longer require parties to attend proceedings, nor can it exercise other powers that are conducive to effective dispute settlement (such as summonsing witnesses or ordering the production of documents). Proceedings are now conducted in private, with strict <b>confidentiality</b> <b>obligations</b> attaching to information disclosed in those proceedings. And given that the commission cannot make enforceable orders, it is unclear how any outcomes it forges can be enforced. If the parties wish to use a private ADR provider then the outcomes are subject to and enforceable under the general law of contract; where they involve arbitration, state commercial arbitration legislation might also apply. While dispute resolution in the AIRC is free of charge, the parties have to meet the costs of private ADR. But the government has established the Alternative Dispute Resolution Assistance Scheme, which enables parties to obtain up to $ 1500 for each eligible dispute, to partially offset the costs of utilising a private ADR provider. These new arrangements have not led employers, employees and unions to “flee” from the AIRC as a dispute resolution forum in favour of the new private ADR option. Federal Budget figures in May revealed that only $ 74, 000 was expended on the assistance scheme in its first year of operation, which equates to around 50 disputes. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that the take-up rate of private ADR has been very low, although the government does not currently make available information regarding the operation of the assistance scheme or private ADR. Employers, employees and unions still seem to prefer using the AIRC in matters where it has jurisdiction. Work Choices cut a huge swathe through the commission’s jurisdiction, however, primarily with its new exemptions on unfair dismissal claims and the removal of the AIRC’s minimum-wage setting and agreement approval functions. On the first anniversary of Work Choices at the end of March, the AIRC president, Justice Giudice, released figures showing that these changes have led to a dramatic reduction in the commission’s workload. Total dispute resolution matters notified to the AIRC fell from 2420 in the year March 2005 -March 2006 to 1344 in the year to March 2007. The commission’s overall workload (measured by total lodgement numbers) was cut by two thirds in the same period, from 29, 246 to 10, 138. These figures paint a starkly illuminating picture of the extent to which the AIRC - the once impregnable institution at the apex of Australia’s industrial relations system - has been marginalised by Work Choices. Coming back, then, to Labor’s proposal to establish Fair Work Australia. Dispute resolution has been designated as one of the many functions that the new organisation would perform, and Labor leader Kevin Rudd has also indicated that Labor would retain the current voluntary dispute settlement framework. But this still leaves many questions unanswered. For example, would the parties still have the option of private ADR, or would all disputes be channelled through Fair Work Australia? In my view, Labor should abolish the private ADR stream and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Assistance Scheme, which are being largely ignored in practice. Instead, all workplace dispute resolution should be brought within the realm of the public agency, Fair Work Australia, and should be fully publicly funded. Within that framework, parties could continue to be given a range of options for having disputes resolved. For example, as well as traditional forms of dispute settlement such as conciliation, mediation and arbitration, newer methods such as conferencing, case appraisal and assisted negotiation could continue to be made available. The parties could choose the form of dispute resolution they want for their particular dispute, and which member of Fair Work Australia they want to assist them. However, parties should be required to have some form of ADR before a matter could be heard and finally determined by Fair Work Australia (as is the case in the Victorian equal opportunity jurisdiction, and is now common practice in many courts). Further, the new oreganisation must have strong powers to ensure effective dispute resolution for a wide range of employment grievances and workplace relations disputes. It must also have the powers necessary to command the authority and respect of the parties. Finally, what are the prospects for dispute resolution if the federal government is re-elected? Clearly, Labor’s new policy position makes it very easy for the government to do what it has probably wanted to do for some time - abolish the AIRC. But what dispute resolution arrangements would the government put in its place? Conceivably, the government might opt for a system based entirely on private ADR. But the experience under Work Choices suggests that this would not meet the needs of the parties. Whatever the outcome of this year’s election, there must be some form of public dispute resolution body in place to ensure that employers, employees and unions are able to access efficient, practical and cost-effective dispute resolution services. • Anthony Forsyth is a senior lecturer in the Department of Business Law at Monash University, and an Advisory Board Member of the Australian Institute of Employment Rights.

In the fields of terminal care and genetics, conflicts arise between the right to veracity and the principles of beneficence and avoiding harm.

Patients should claim their right to <b>confidentiality.</b> The <b>obligation</b> of loyalty or fidelity, that is the obligation that physicians have to give priority to patient’s needs over own needs, has generated divided loyalties in many fields of medical practice due to changes in health organization and social context. The right to territorial, body and psychological or spiritual intimacy are three aspects of the right to intimacy that must be considered. Maybe, patient’s rights are just the other face of medical obligations towards them. If we physicians become defenders of patient’s rights, this could be another subtle facet of paternalism.

40|$|M. Phil. Whistleblowers {{have become}} known as being disloyal {{employees}} and troublemakers. This perception has caused whistle blowing to be despised rather than encouraged. Whistle blowing is effectively raising a concern about an impropriety that assists in ensuring individual responsibility and organisational accountability. Making disclosures causes employees to be victimised by their employers as well as fellow employees. Employees generally did not feel protected enough {{to come forward with}} information on corruption, even though the witness protection system had been reformed and was working well. A well functioning hotline system is of importance and should be linked to the implementation of a protection regime for whistle blowers. Employees making anonymous disclosures are difficult to investigate, in that problems in corroborating the information as well as in not being able to remedy the underlying cause of the disclosure exist. Hotlines through which the public and employees anonymously report suspected corruption does not satisfactory deal with the issues when the purpose of whistle blowing is to promote a culture of transparency and accountability. The aim is to provide provisions for employees to disclose information about suspected criminals or other irregular conduct without fear or reprisals. The Protected Disclosures Act is an important step in providing protection for those who expose corruption in the workplace. Employers and employees should be treated on an equal basis with regards to whistle blowing. It {{is in the best interest}} of both employees and employers to have internal channels that encourage protected disclosures, providing protection to both employers and employees. Different measures exist to protect whistleblowers. One such measure is by means of legislation. Secondly, courts have also developed principles in this regard. However, in certain instances, the labour law will not provide protection were a professional individual acts in breach of the <b>confidentiality</b> <b>obligation</b> vested upon him within the client professional relationship. Legislation relating to general protection such as the right to freedom of association and access to information, also provide protection. The codes of conduct and ethical rules of professional bodies can also be adapted to provide protection to professionals, including employment contracts that provide for protection in certain instances. Despite all of the above, instances will always arise where tensions exist and problems arise, such as the continuous tension between the monopoly of the state in respect of certain information and the question on which information should be protected under legislation. It is therefore clear that many instances arise where protection is not afforded to whistleblowers. To apply the protection afforded by the Protected Disclosure Act horizontally between private bodies, private bodies should be protected from detriment. A tax consultant aware that a client is defrauding the South African Revenue Service will fear that if it challenges the client or threatens to report the fraud, the client will cancel the contract. It is recommended that a more inclusive approach to employment is to be followed as "atypical" employment is on the increase in South Africa as in many other countries. Homework, where a person undertakes to work on contract from home as well as workers supplied by temporary employment services, enable the organisations to vary the number of workers deployed so as to ensure flexibility. Independent contractors are often in a good position to uncover and disclose irregular conduct in the private or public sector. In addition, it is also advised that applicants for employment in the definition of an employee in the Protected Disclosures Act be included. In order to protect whistle blowers further, the definition of occupational detriment in the above act should also be extended to include reprisal by employers such as the use or treat to use defamation suites and suites based on the alleged breach of confidentiality, a loss of a contract or the inexplicable failure to be given a contract in the instance of contract workers. In addition, the list of forms of occupational detriment to be suffered should be left open ended to allow recognition of further types of victimisation. The effectiveness of measures put in place within organisations to encourage employees to speak out against impropriety and misconduct will be difficult to determine as only when there has been non-adherence to the Protected Disclosures Act and the whistle blower has been detrimentally affected, will it come into force to protect bona fide whistleblowers...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on nine sets of {{arbitration}} rules which include the rules of American Arbitration Association/The International Centre for Dispute Resolution (“AAA”) effective as of 1 June 2009, the rules of German Institution of Arbitration (“DIS”) in force from 1 July 1998, the rules of The Arbitration Institute of the Finland Chamber of Commerce (“FCC”) that came into force on 1 June 2013, the rules of Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”) effective as of 1 November 2013, the rules of International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) in force since 1 January 2012, the rules of The London Court of International Arbitration (“LCIA”) effective 1 January 1998, the rules of Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (“SCC”) applicable as of 1 January 2010, the rules of The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) that took effect on 1 April 2013 and the rules of Swiss Chambers' Arbitration Institution that came into force on 1 June 2012 (“the Swiss rules”) of which six include a duty of confidentiality upon parties. The DIS, FCC, HKIAC, LCIA, SIAC and Swiss rules contain a duty of confidentiality upon parties. The basic idea of the thesis is to assess confidentiality {{from the point of}} view of institutional rules so national law is only employed as a back-up set of rules and as an interpretative aid. One research question is “How confidentiality based on institutional rules can be protected efficiently?”. The main idea is to evaluate the duties of <b>confidentiality</b> as <b>obligations</b> and to assess what they include. It is assessed what the duties of confidentiality include in terms of contents, temporal aspects and exceptions. Contents of the duties vary and the greatest difference relates to confidentiality of existence of the arbitration. Not protecting confidentiality of existence of the arbitration creates the first gap in confidentiality. Exceptions in the FCC and SIAC rules are of a developing nature, which makes them vague. In general, exceptions cannot be listed exhaustively in the rules. The exceptions create gaps in the duty of confidentiality because confidentiality cannot be absolute. However, because of the gaps a party may disclose based on inappropriate reasons. On the other hand, the exceptions take the need for publicity into account and thus the rules of FCC and SIAC are the most developed from that point of view. Another research question is “Why is confidentiality necessary?” to which the thesis answers by way of commenting interest in confidentiality and publicity from parties’ standpoint. The thesis also includes an assessment why duties of confidentiality have been enacted and why in a certain way. That evaluation is conducted from institute’s point of view. Further, it is presented how parties can affect efficient protection of confidentiality by way of assessing their own and opponent’s interests concerning confidentiality and publicity already when concluding the arbitration agreement. Although confidentiality is necessary, it may be breached or it can be tried to be breached. The thesis studies interim measures, remedies and sanctions {{from the point of view}} of protection of confidentiality...|$|R
40|$|L'auteur interroge la déontologie de la profession, ses moyens de mise en œuvre et ses difficultés d'application. In Quebec, only {{associations}} {{created in}} conformity with the Professional Code may use the title of professional corporation. The PC admits two types of profession: those exercising exclusive jurisdiction over their designation and their field of activity, and those exercising exclusive jurisdiction over the former but not the latter. The purpose of such corporations {{is to protect the}} public interest through their attention to the competence and professional conduct of their members. This approach to legislative policy has favoured the emergence of legislation regarding the professions the main thrust of which is professional ethics. The Corporation of Industrial Relations Counsellors (IRC) is a corporation in the second sense of the PC noted above. The law in question defines the activities of Industrial Relations Counsellors as: «the art of establishing, maintaining and changing relations between employees, between employers or between employers and employees». The present author addresses himself to the questions of professional ethics, ways of application and difficulties of enforcement. According to the terms of the PC, the professional corporation must adopt a code of ethics. The resulting code must require of the professional in question duties of both a general and a specific nature designed to cover activities, functions and inadmissible acts. The code of the IRC stipulates duties and obligations with regard to the public, the client and the profession. The concerning the public require of theCounsellor to exercise his profession with respect for human dignity. He must moreover, favour measures encouraging the quality of services through education, information and research. As regards the client, the Industrial Relations Counsellor can only accept a mandate falling within areas of his competence. Included also are specific rules dealing the quality of the professional act (integrity, availability and application), conflict of interest, <b>confidentiality</b> and fees. <b>Obligations</b> toward the profession involve the prohibition of discrimination and unbecoming behaviour. The Corporation of Industrial Relations Counsellors must see to it that the code of ethics is respected. In turn, the Corporation is responsible before the Office des professions. The Corporation exercises its role through professional inspection, disciplinary measures and arbitration. A professional inspection committee is established. This committee can take measures to disbar a member, require him to enrol in a programme to improve and update his professional knowledge, or give directives concerning the keeping of records. The disciplinary powers are of a semi-judicial nature. Each complaint is submitted to the Committee on discipline whose decisions are subject to appeal before the Tribunal des professions. In addition, a client convinced of unwarranted or excessive billing by a Counsellor can have recourse to conciliation by syndic followed by intervention of the Council for the arbitration of accounts. As in the case of all other corporation, the Corporation of Industrial Relations Councellors is confronted with people who refuse to become members or decide to withdraw, in order to avoid its controle. At the same time, they continue to exercise their profession with impunity under another professional designation than that reserved for members of the Corporation. It {{is for this reason that}} there are a great number of demands for exclusivity of practice. For the author, this solution does not seem to the most opportune, unless the working group on administrative tribunals reserves for lawyers the right of access to administrative tribunals as members or legal counsel. In this eventuality, it appears clear that the Corporation should demand a professional field shared by its members as well as those of the legal profession regarding labour courts. It should be noted that the most serious threat to the profession originates in contexts where the Counsellor, acting as a salaried employee of a firm or union occasionally ignores professional ethics because of a supposed threat to the career. For this reason, the present author suggests that the law should be modified to provide protection against the use of administrative or disciplinary measures where the professional refuses to perform acts contrary to the code of ethics (for example: prepare a biased test, declare an illegal strike, refuse to hire Corporation members, etc.). It is clear that the Corporation is required by law to subject its members to rules of competence and application. And it is in the best interests of the general public to encourage the initiative taken by the profession to further the development of a code of ethics...|$|R
