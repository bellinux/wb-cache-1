5|$|Jersey {{was part}} of Neustria with the same Gallo-Frankish {{population}} as the continental mainland. Jersey, the whole <b>Channel</b> <b>Islands</b> and the Cotentin peninsula (probably with the Avranchin) came formerly {{under the control of}} the duke of Brittany during the Viking invasions, because the king of the Franks was unable to defend them, however they remained in the archbishopric of Rouen. Jersey was invaded by Vikings in the 9th century. In 933 it was annexed to the future Duchy of Normandy, together with the other <b>Channel</b> <b>Islands,</b> Cotentin and Avranchin, by William Longsword, count of Rouen and it became one of the Norman Islands. When William's descendant, William the Conqueror, conquered England in 1066, the Duchy of Normandy and the kingdom of England were governed under one monarch. The Dukes of Normandy owned considerable estates in the island, and Norman families living on their estates established many of the historical Norman-French Jersey family names. King John lost all his territories in mainland Normandy in 1204 to King Philip II Augustus, but retained possession of Jersey and the other <b>Channel</b> <b>Islands.</b>|$|E
