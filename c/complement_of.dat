5|$|The total <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> {{proteins}} {{present at}} a time in a cell or cell type is known as its proteome, and the study of such large-scale data sets defines the field of proteomics, named by analogy to the related field of genomics. Key experimental techniques in proteomics include 2D electrophoresis, which allows the separation {{of a large number of}} proteins, mass spectrometry, which allows rapid high-throughput identification of proteins and sequencing of peptides (most often after in-gel digestion), protein microarrays, which allow the detection of the relative levels of a large number of proteins present in a cell, and two-hybrid screening, which allows the systematic exploration of protein–protein interactions. The total <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> biologically possible such interactions is known as the interactome. A systematic attempt to determine the structures of proteins representing every possible fold is known as structural genomics.|$|E

Analysis of the free amino acids (that is, those not bound up in protein) revealed glutamine and alanine to be the principal amino acids (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E

5|$|Bouvet capsized {{and sank}} {{in about two}} minutes. The ship was in poor {{condition}} at the time due to her age, which likely contributed to her rapid sinking, though there was some speculation that her ammunition magazine exploded. The destruction of the ship caught the Allies by surprise; her loss came {{during the height of}} the bombardment. Torpedo boats and other smaller vessels rushed to pick up survivors, but they rescued only a handful of men. From her <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> 710 men, some 660 were killed in the sinking.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the team {{departed}} for Australia in late March they had played 74 matches in Britain, winning 49, losing 20, and drawing 5. However, due to injury, Warbrick only appeared in 14 matches; in contrast David Gage featured in 68, and eight other members played more than 50. Warbrick {{was not the only}} player to experience injury; the taxing schedule of matches took a toll, and he frequently struggled to find a full <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> 15 fit players. On top of playing relatively few matches in Britain, Warbrick scored only once there – a conversion against Devon.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months, the wing was not {{assigned}} any aircraft, and thus worked with other units who were in possession of the B-36 Peacemaker. In March and April, the base began preparing for operations of the B-36, which arrived later in April. This gave the newly activated 69th Bombardment Squadron a full <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> aircraft. By the end of August, the number had increased to 27 bombers, 322 officers, 313 airmen, and 350 civilians. Additionally, more buildings were constructed on base, making it more of a home for airmen and their families.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 17th century, the {{maritime}} use of the white flag with the Royal coat of arms of Portugal was increasingly restricted to the war ships. An ordinance of 1692 expressly banned the use of this flag by the Portuguese merchant ships, restricting its use to ships with 20 or more cannons and with a <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> 40 or more men. The Portuguese merchant ships flew instead green and white striped flags, which were the national colours of Portugal at that time. The colours green and white were also used in other Portuguese flags, like the naval commissioning pennants.|$|E
5|$|English syntax {{relies on}} {{auxiliary}} verbs for many functions including {{the expression of}} tense, aspect and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.|$|E

The new organisation was smaller than the old - fewer men were needed for vehicle crews - and so even after the creation of the new Reconnaissance Company on 27 March, the 824th finished the month with a <b>complement</b> <b>of</b> 646 all ranks, down from 750.|$|E

The Persians, seeking to avoid a battle, beached their fleet below the slopes of Mycale, and, {{with the support of}} a Persian army group, built a palisaded camp.
