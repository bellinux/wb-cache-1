5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and <b>centrifugation</b> techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated <b>centrifugation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{possibilities}} exist, as well. For example, immunohistochemistry usually utilizes an antibody {{to one or}} more proteins {{of interest}} that are conjugated to enzymes yielding either luminescent or chromogenic signals that can be compared between samples, allowing for localization information. Another applicable technique is cofractionation in sucrose (or other material) gradients using isopycnic <b>centrifugation.</b> While this technique does not prove colocalization of a compartment of known density and the protein of interest, it does increase the likelihood, and is more amenable to large-scale studies.|$|E

40|$|Three {{methods for}} the {{recovery}} of Chlamydia pneumoniae from spiked nasopharyngeal and blood specimens, including extended culture and additional <b>centrifugations,</b> were compared. Additional <b>centrifugations</b> and a 7 -day culture time resulted in a 500 - to 5, 000 -fold {{increase in the number}} of detectable inclusion-forming units...|$|R
30|$|Blood {{samples were}} {{collected}} from orbital sinus of all animals immediately before animals were killed. Serum was separated by <b>centrifugations</b> at 3000  rpm for 10  min. The serum was used for liver function assessment employing measurements of the enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alanine aspartate aminotransferase (AST) by following the instructions of enzymatic colorimetric assay kits (Diamond Diagnostic).|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{cellular}} fractionation of Chlamydomonas reinhardii, SAG 11 - 32 /b, and isolation of intact chloroplasts from synchronized {{cells of the}} alga is described. The procedure for cell fractionation comprises essentially four steps: (1) protoplast production with autolysine; (2) lysis of the protoplasts with digitonin; (3) aggregation of broken protoplasts; and (4) separation of organelles by differential <b>centrifugations...</b>|$|R
25|$|Algae can be {{harvested}} using microscreens, by <b>centrifugation,</b> by flocculation and by froth flotation.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{acceleration}} including vibration, <b>centrifugation</b> and agitation {{are sometimes}} used. They subject {{the product to}} different forces that pushes the particles / droplets against one another, hence helping in the film drainage. However, some emulsions would never coalesce in normal gravity, while they do under artificial gravity. Moreover, segregation of different populations of particles have been highlighted when using <b>centrifugation</b> and vibration.|$|E
25|$|From fluid tissues such as blood, {{cells are}} {{extracted}} by bulk methods, usually <b>centrifugation</b> or apheresis. From solid tissues, extraction is more difficult. Usually the tissue is minced, and then digested with the enzymes trypsin or collagenase {{to remove the}} extracellular matrix (ECM) that holds the cells. After that, the cells are free floating, and extracted using <b>centrifugation</b> or apheresis.|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{has been}} developed for the isolation of rotavirus from human fecal specimens based on {{the resistance of the}} virus to treatment with cold 1 % lithium dodecyl sulfate at neutral pH.

40|$|AbstractThe binding {{of protein}} HU from Escherichia coli to nucleic acids was {{investigated}} by affinity chromatography under various conditions, by a nitrocellulose retention assay and by isopycnic <b>centrifugations</b> in metrizamide gradients. The {{results indicate that}} HU has a preference for binding to RNA and single-stranded DNA over double-stranded DNA. The affinity of HU for supercoiled DNA was also {{less than that of}} the corresponding relaxed DNA...|$|R
25|$|Caesium {{chloride}} {{is widely}} used in <b>centrifugation</b> in a technique known as isopycnic <b>centrifugation.</b> Centripetal and diffusive forces establish a density gradient that allow separation of mixtures {{on the basis of}} their molecular density. This technique allows separation of DNA of different densities (e.g. DNA fragments with differing A-T or G-C content). This application requires a solution with high density and yet relatively low viscosity, and CsCl suits it because of its high solubility in water, high density owing to the large mass of Cs, as well as low viscosity and high stability of CsCl solutions.|$|E
25|$|Trypanosomes can be {{detected}} from patient samples using two different preparations. A wet preparation {{can be used to}} look for the motile trypanosomes. Alternatively, a fixed (dried) smear can be stained using Giemsa's or Field's technique and examined under a microscope. Often, the parasite is in relatively low abundance in the sample, so techniques to concentrate the parasites can be used prior to microscopic examination. For blood samples, these include <b>centrifugation</b> followed by examination of the buffy coat; mini anion-exchange/centrifugation; and the quantitative buffy coat (QBC) technique. For other samples, such as spinal fluid, concentration techniques include <b>centrifugation</b> followed by examination of the sediment.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{substance}} {{that is being}} removed, different processes are employed in apheresis. If separation by density is required, <b>centrifugation</b> {{is the most common}} method. Other methods involve absorption onto beads coated with an absorbent material and filtration.|$|E

50|$|Gas {{centrifuges}} {{are used}} in uranium enrichment. The heavier isotope of uranium (uranium-238) in the uranium hexafluoride gas tends to concentrate at {{the walls of the}} centrifuge as it spins, while the desired uranium-235 isotope is extracted and concentrated with a scoop selectively placed inside the centrifuge. It takes many thousands of <b>centrifugations</b> to enrich uranium enough for use in a nuclear reactor (around 3.5% enrichment), and many thousands more to enrich it to weapons-grade (above 90% enrichment) for use in nuclear weapons.|$|R

The thylakoid membrane was prepared as described previously (Tang et al. 2005) with minor modifications and carried under 0 – 4  °C. The three <b>centrifugations</b> were modified as 500 g for 5  min, 8000 g for 10  min, 13, 000 g for 20  min.

25|$|In {{expanded}} bed adsorption, a {{fluidized bed}} is used, {{rather than a}} solid phase made by a packed bed. This allows omission of initial clearing steps such as <b>centrifugation</b> and filtration, for culture broths or slurries of broken cells.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial {{chromosomes}} {{tend to be}} {{tethered to}} the plasma membrane of the bacteria. In molecular biology application, this allows for its isolation from plasmid DNA by <b>centrifugation</b> of lysed bacteria and pelleting of the membranes (and the attached DNA).|$|E
25|$|Isopropyl {{alcohol is}} often used in DNA extraction. It is added to a DNA {{solution}} in order to precipitate the DNA which then forms a pellet after <b>centrifugation.</b> This is possible because DNA is insoluble in isopropyl alcohol.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe precise {{localization}} of a membrane-bound, arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (mADP-RT) {{was assessed}} in rabbit skeletal muscle by studying membrane fractions isolated by successive sucrose density gradient <b>centrifugations.</b> mADP-RT activity was 10 -fold enriched in sarcolemmal and T-tubular membranes. The catalytic activity, determined in preparations with mainly right-side-out vesicles, {{was found to}} be on the cytoplasmic face. As revealed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography endogenous mADP-RT activity labeled several proteins in the range between 15 kDa and 250 kDa. T-tubules contained the highest number of [32 P]ADP-ribose-labeled proteins...|$|R
30|$|For {{generating}} of anti-HBsAg antibodies the B cell {{were acquired}} from the patients {{suffering from the}} Acute and Chronic Hepatitis B. The protocol was identical to that published (22). Dane particles, isolated from the patients’ blood by PEG gradients precipitation or from liver biopsies by CsCl gradient <b>centrifugations,</b> were rapidly frozen, lyophilized and stored. Alternatively, HBsAg were produced in human hepatoma cells transfected with plasmid DNA. Prior to selection, during in vitro evolution, they were reconstituted with buffer and served as the molecular baits. They also served as the negative controls for anti-HER- 2 antibodies.|$|R
40|$|A {{membrane}} immunofluorescent-antibody {{test was}} developed to detect diacetyl-producing Pediococcus contaminants in brewery pitching yeast (yeast [Saccharomyces cerevisiae] slurry collected for reinoculation). <b>Centrifugations</b> at 11 and 5, 100 x g separate yeast cells from bacteria and concentrate the bacteria, respectively. Pelleted bacteria resuspended and trapped on a black membrane filter are reacted with monoclonal antibodies specific for cell surface antigens and then with fluorescein-conjugated indicator antibodies. Whether pitching yeast is contaminated with pediococci at 0. 001 % is determined in less than 4 h. The sensitivity of the assay is 2 orders of magnitude below the Pediococcus detection limit of direct microscopy...|$|R
25|$|Ultrafiltration {{concentrates}} {{a protein}} solution using selective permeable membranes. The {{function of the}} membrane is to let the water and small molecules pass through while retaining the protein. The solution is forced against the membrane by mechanical pump, gas pressure, or <b>centrifugation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The unit of {{measurement}} {{used to describe the}} ribosomal subunits and the rRNA fragments is the Svedberg unit, a measure of the rate of sedimentation in <b>centrifugation</b> rather than size. This accounts for why fragment names do not add up: for example, prokaryotic 70S ribosomes are made of 50S and 30S subunits.|$|E
25|$|Protocols for {{isolation}} of plasma from maternal blood include <b>centrifugation,</b> followed by isolation and purification of cell-free DNA. A standardized protocol by Legler et al. {{was created in}} 2007 from evaluation of previous primary literature. The highest yield for extraction of cell-free DNA was obtained with QIAamp DSP Virus Kit.|$|E
40|$|Analyses of {{sequence}} complexities, stage specific gene expression, and mRNA {{sequence divergence}} require polysomal RNA preparations relatively free of nuclear RNA contamination. Conventional {{procedures for the}} isolation of uncontaminated polysomal RNAs which rely on sucrose density <b>centrifugations</b> are laborious and unsuitable for large scale isolations. We describe here a method using sequential Sepharose chromatography for isolating polysomes and polysomal RNAs depleted for nuclear RNA. Polysomes and polysomal RNAs isolated from livers of Xenopus stimulated to produce vitellogenin were capable of directing protein synthesis in vitro and showed little evidence of degradation. The polysomal RNAs contained less than 0. 5 % of nuclear RNA...|$|R
30|$|The osmotic {{substances}} {{measured in}} the experiment included total soluble sugars, free proline, and soluble protein. Total soluble sugars were estimated using anthrone reagent (Yemm and Willis 1954). Samples were extracted with 4 ml of 80 % methanol at 80 °C for 40 min and were then centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 15 min. The methanol supernatants of three successive <b>centrifugations</b> {{were used for the}} sugar analyses. About 4 mL of anthrone reagent was then added. The mixture was heated in a boiling water bath for 8 min, and then cooled. Optical density of green to dark green color was read at 630 nm.|$|R
40|$|Part I. The use of {{doubled haploid}} plants in a wheat {{breeding}} program requires an efficient regeneration system. While the techniques for producing doubled haploids from anther culture are well established, those for isolated microspores are complicated and inefficient. The {{objective of this}} research was to determine a simple, efficient system for regenerating plants from isolated microspore culture. Four methods of isolating microspores from anthers (blending, stirring, macerating, and floating) were compared. The effects of pre-isolation mannitol conditioning, cell density, culture dilution and sucrose <b>centrifugations</b> on microspore viability also were evaluated. Isolation by blending gave the highest initial microspore viability, determined by fluorescein diacetate staining (75...|$|R
25|$|Intermittent flow <b>centrifugation</b> {{works in}} cycles, taking blood, spinning/processing {{it and then}} giving back the unused parts to the donor in a bolus. The main {{advantage}} is a single venipuncture site. To stop the blood from coagulating, anticoagulant is automatically mixed with the blood as it is pumped from the body into the apheresis machine.|$|E
25|$|Thylakoids can be {{purified}} from plant cells using {{a combination}} of differential and gradient <b>centrifugation.</b> Disruption of isolated thylakoids, for example by mechanical shearing, releases the lumenal fraction. Peripheral and integral membrane fractions can be extracted from the remaining membrane fraction. Treatment with sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) detaches peripheral membrane proteins, whereas treatment with detergents and organic solvents solubilizes integral membrane proteins.|$|E
25|$|Unprocessed milk {{consists}} of globules of milk fat suspended in a watery base containing dissolved proteins, sugars, vitamins, and minerals. If the globules are large enough, as with unprocessed milk from cows, the fat globules float upwards until {{they form a}} distinct cream layer at the top. Some animals, such as goats, produce smaller fat globules that remain mixed unless mechanically separated by <b>centrifugation.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paired helical {{filaments}} (PHFs) of Alzheimer's disease were purified by {{a strategy}} {{in which the}} neurons and amyloid plaque cores of protein (APCP) were initially isolated. This was achieved by several steps of isocratic sucrose <b>centrifugations</b> of increasing molarity and a discontinuous isotonic Percoll density gradient. After collagenase elimination of contaminating blood vessels, lysis of neurons was produced by SDS treatment. The released PHF cytoskeletons were separated from contaminating APCP and lipofuscin by sucrose density gradient. A final step consisted in the chemical purification of highly enriched PHFs and APCP components via a formic acid to guanidine hydrochloride transition. PHFs and APCPs were fractionated by size exclusion HPL...|$|R
40|$|Basophils are {{blood cells}} of low {{abundance}} associated with allergy, inflammation and parasite infections. To study the transcriptome of mature circulating basophils cells were purified from buffy coats by density gradient <b>centrifugations</b> and two-step magnetic cell sorting. However, after extensive analysis {{the cells were}} found to be transcriptionally inactive and almost completely lack functional mRNA. In order to obtain transcriptionally active immature basophils for analysis of their transcriptome, umbilical cord blood cells were therefore cultured in the presence of interleukin (IL) - 3 for 9 days and basophils were enriched by removing non-basophils using magnetic cell sorting.

40|$|The Gotschlich {{procedure}} {{for the production}} of carbohydrate antigens from the supernatant fluids of cultures of Neisseria meningitidis groups A and C was modified. Steps involving digestion with nucleases and gel filtration through Sephadex G- 50 were added, the number of extractions was greatly reduced, and high-speed <b>centrifugations</b> were eliminated. The antigens thus obtained appeared to be entirely comparable to those described by Gotschlich et al. in physical, chemical, and antigenic properties. A slight degree of protection of mice was repeatedly demonstrated with extraordinarily large doses of antigen (50 μg/mouse), but not with smaller doses. Toxicity of the antigens for laboratory animals was very slight...|$|R
