These models were functions of soil moisture content, soil plastic limit or liquid limit and two constants which depend on the soil type and depth. Also, a model to estimate the soil moisture content by a simple and accurate method was developed using the data of daily precipitation and evaporation pan reading (class A) in southern Quebec. The soil mechanical properties models were used to study the traction characteristics of lugged tires.

It was {{the percentage of the}} actual yield value or could be achieved value compared with the forecast value of the grain yield potential. The forecast potential value was combined with the estimation value or the actual yield value of the year, which could be used to evaluate the actual degree yield potential achieved.

The results of application showed that per unit yield and total yield potential conversion rate were around 100 % in 2010, which indicated the progress of science and technology to the production still played a supporting role. But the per unit yield and total yield potential conversion rate was less than 100 % from 1999 to 2008, which showed the progress of science and technology to the yield function was reducing. Therefore, the conversion rate of grain yield potential could be used to evaluate the trend of grain yield and the contribution of technological progress, and the method was practical and with low error...|$|E

The data was collected in the control non-irrigated plants of an irrigation experiment installed at the Dão Research Station, Nelas, Portugal. The vineyard is established in a typical granitic soil and trained on a vertical shoot positioning. According to the Géoviticulture Multicriteria Climatic Classification System, the Dão region is classified as temperate/temperate warm for the heliothermal index, with cool nights (night cold index) and moderately dry (dryness index). In 2004 the predawn leaf water potential presented always values higher than - 0. 2 MPa from flowering to harvest but in 2005 moderate to severe water stress was observed during the ripening period (- 0. 4 MPa at veraison to - 0. 6 MPa at harvest). Leaf stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate displayed a decreasing pattern from flowering to harvest in both years but attained much lower values in the 2005 ripening period as compared to that of 2004. The yield was similar in both years but 2005 showed lower sugar content, similar titratable acidity and a higher anthocyanin berry skin content.

40|$|Livestock {{systems are}} and will {{increasingly}} be impacted by climate change primarily because the feed supply produced {{on the farm}} (pastures, forage crops) depends greatly on the climatic conditions experienced. To adapt grassland-based livestock systems to climate change, some transformational redesign of the farming system may be required. Redesign is basically a matter of reconfiguring land-use for feed production and management practices set up to cope with weather variability. We present a participatory method to design systems adapted to new conditions. It {{is based on a}} pre-existing game-like platform (Forage Rummy) in which various year-round forage production and animal feeding requirements have to be assembled by participants with the support of a computerised support system. The weather scenario considered is conveyed by dedicated intermediary objects (e. g. herbage growth chart, rainfall chart) for a <b>climatic</b> <b>year</b> that is fully revealed before the design process starts. The solutions developed are then evaluated according to criteria of biophysical performance, organisational feasibility, and feeding shortage risks. The method consists of a sequence of three workshops (W) for which Forage Rummy was adapted. It keeps the complexity of the design problem manageable by progressively introducing the difficulties faced. W 1 aims to produce a configuration that satisfies an average weather scenario of the future. W 2 refines or possibly revises the previous configuration by considering between-year variability. W 3 explicitly takes uncertainty about the weather into account. Unlike W 1 - 2, in which entire weather scenarios are shown at the beginning, weather is only revealed month by month in W 3.

40|$|Integrated dynamic {{water and}} {{chloride}} balance models with a catchment-scale hydrological model (PRMS) {{are used to}} investigate the response of a terminal tropical lake, Lake Abiyata, to climate variability and water use practices in its catchment. The hydrological model is used to investigate {{the response of the}} catchment to different climate and land-use change scenarios that are incorporated into the lake model. Lake depth-area-volume relationships were established from lake bathymetries. Missing data in the time series were filled using statistical regression techniques. Based on mean monthly data, the lake water balance model produced a good agreement between the simulated and observed levels of Lake Abiyata for the period 1968 - 83. From 1984 onwards the simulated lake level is overestimated with respect to the observed one, while the chloride concentration is largely underestimated. This discrepancy is attributed to human use of water from the influent rivers or directly from the lake. The simulated lake level and chloride concentration are in better agreement with observed values (r 2 = 0 * 96) when human water use for irrigation and salt exploitation are included in the model. A comparison of the simulation with and without human consumption indicates that climate variability controls the interannual fluctuations and that the human water use affects the equilibrium of the system by strongly reducing the lake level. Sensitivity analysis based on a mean <b>climatic</b> <b>year</b> showed that, after prolonged mean climatic conditions, Lake Abiyata reacts more rapidly to an abrupt shift to wetter conditions than to dry conditions. This study shows the significant sensitivity of the level and salinity of the terminal Lake Abiyata to small changes in climate or land use, making it a very good 'recorder' of environmental changes that may occur in the catchment at different time scales...|$|E

40|$|Lonicera caerulea var. kamschatica {{is called}} popular in {{countries}} where it is cultivated,,blue-honeysuckle,, and we call it,,fruiting lonicera,,. This {{is one of the}} few species of Lonicera with edible fruits. The blue –honeysuckle (Lonicera caerulea var. kamschatica) and chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa) are interesting fruit species both for fruit producing plantations and ornamental purposes. Berberis thunbergii var. atropurpurea is the variety of barberry with ornamental purposes and a great fruiting potential, by taking advantage of abundant yield and various phytochemicals in fruit content. Lonicera selections fruit trees obtained at the Institute Pitesti have noted a number of features, such as early ripening fruit, winter frost resistance, adaptability to different climatic conditions, rich in anthocyanins berries and a high antioxidant activity (Oprea et al., 2002). Chockberry is a fruiting shrub, particularly important as natural source for the coloring of the foods. After some early studies, it was discovered that red barberry fruits had the highest content of total acidity in comparison with all other fruits, thus constituting an important natural source of organic acids (Mladin G. et al., 1996). Anthocyanins and tannins are biochemical compounds playing a major role in the formation of fruit color, taste, as well as the quality of fruits derivatives. Also, they have in the same time, beneficial effects for human health due to the antioxidant activities and protecting blood vessels. This study aimed to evaluate a genetic material (consisting of selections from these three species) in terms of biochemical compounds content in fruits, in order to complete the biochemical characterization of the genotypes and identifying those with hig, medium or lower content giving fruit taste as pleasant, with moderate to low astringency. In the period 2004 - 2007 were studied 24 blue-honeysuckle selections, three selections of barberry and one variety of chockberry. Methods for determining these compounds were the usual spectrophotometric for anthocyanins (by the method of Fuleki and Francis, 1968) and HPTLC, for four lonicera selections and by the Lowenthal -Neubeur, 1977, procedure for tannins. Total anthocyanin content in the fruits of Lonicera varied widely, from 206. 0 mg% to 579. 0 mg%. Nero chockeberry variety accumulated in fruits high anthocyanins, 509, 16 mg%. Barberry selections have accumulated much smaller amounts of anthocyanins, between 71. 28 mg % and 79, 43 mg%. The genotypes of Lonicera had tannin content between 0, 218 % and 0, 429 %. Barberry selections were marked by high content of tannins with an average from 0. 610 % to 0. 990 %, the ckockberry variety Nero with an average of 0. 993 %.

40|$|This master thesis investigates sudden HVDC-cable {{exchange}} limitations between thermal-based and hydro dominated {{areas from}} a market perspective. Thermal-based areas {{are based on}} fossil-fired units in combination with large amounts of wind and solar energy. This power production structure resembles Germany. The power market simulator used is EMPS (EFIs Multi-area Power-market Simulator), which is a well-known simulation tool throughout the Nordic area. The simulation uses historical water inflow and weather measurements for 75 climatic years, giving {{a wide range of}} different outcomes. The outage analyses are mainly done in a data set developed by SINTEF resembling the North-European power system configuration in year 2030. The EU has agreed upon extensive objectives regarding reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The energy sector is changing towards more Renewable Energy Sources (RES). The challenge is that RES is not able to accomplish the same flexibility as conventional power plants provide. Flexible hydropower production from Norway intends to support intermittence of RES and contribute to security of supply. Exchange capacity from Norway to continental Europe is provided through HVDC-cables. This report shows the impact of HVDC-cable outages on North-European power prices. Statistical data shows that HVDC-cable disturbance outages occur. Disturbance outages are forced outages limiting the cross-border power exchange. The average cable unavailability due to such outages is 2. 4 weeks per year. The cable investigated is the planned cable connecting Norway to Germany, Nord. Link, with a capacity of 1. 4 GW. Outages are modelled annually {{from the beginning of the}} first week in each simulated <b>climatic</b> <b>year.</b> There is a higher probability of stressed operation in winter time, due to high load combined with lower solar production, and this season is assumed to be a critical period for outages. The results show that a three-week outage of Nord. Link has close to no impact on the average price in Germany for all 75 simulated years. However, during power capacity shortage, the price increases significantly. Power capacity shortage comes with low wind and solar production combined with high consumption, and demand is met by use of expensive flexible load. It is seen that the highest price in Germany reaches 900 EUR/MWh at worst. This is 200 EUR/MWh higher than if Nord. Link had been available. German consumers are most affected during outage on Nord. Link. In this study, a three-week outage reduces the consumer surplus in Germany by 60 MEUR in the worst year due to the significant increase in prices. However, the mean loss in consumer surplus for all climatic years is less, being close to 8 MEUR. The results also discover that there is not the outage length that is critical regarding consequences, but the initial power situation in the affected period. A fifteen-week outage of Nord. Link on average costs German consumers 30 MEUR, while a two-week outage during power capacity shortage exceeds 50 MEUR. The results show that transmission cable outage gives the same consequences in consumer surplus in Germany as power production outage for the same capacity. Additionally, the fault-statistics are in favour of cables. Cross-border capacity should therefore be included in foreign Capacity Remuneration Mechanism (CRM). CRM pays for installed capacity to support intermittence of renewables, making power supply capacity more profitable. Furthermore, Norway becomes a more secure source of supply in the future due to more interconnections, making it possible to import energy in dry years to store water in reservoirs. HVDC-cable exchange between the Nordic area and the European continent improves security of supply, and is in line with EUs target of a clean and strongly interconnected power system. The value of providing back-up capacity to the continent is high because the power exchange will reduce continental prices significantly during power capacity shortage, reducing the electricity bill for consumers...|$|E

Agroecosystems are located close to human settlements and are managed to produce food and fibers, traded in markets. Agroecosystems also produce other {{goods and services}} essential to human beings, such as climate regulation, flood mitigation, and landscape amenity. Economists and ecologists have developed the ecosystem services framework to foster the provision of these non-commercial services. Scientists can therefore help decision makers to develop sustainable ecosystems by studying ecosystem services. Here, we analyze the trade-offs of ecosystem services of farming systems. We discuss case studies of mixed perennial crops. The set of ecosystem services provided by these agroecosystems depends on their composition, structure, and management. Complex rule-based management will be required if winegrowers are to maintain an adequate set of ecosystem services across contrasting <b>climatic</b> <b>years.</b> Innovations including cover crops in banana systems can fulfill most of the objective set but will rely on increased farm labor.

DyNoFlo is an integrated dynamic model that incorporates Markov-chain simulation of cow flows and crop model simulations for historical <b>climatic</b> <b>years</b> (El Niño, La Niña, and Neutral years). It also includes optimization of managerial options. It responds to dairy-specific environment (climate and soils) and management (livestock management, waste management, crop systems management).

Analyzing a typical North Florida dairy farm, it was found that N leaching was highest during winter El Niño years. Sandy soils were substantially more prone to leach N, and perennial grasses were better to prevent N leaching. The typical farm could decrease N leaching up to 23 % in an El Niño year and still maintain profit by adjusting protein in the diet, confinement time for milking cows, and combining perennial grasses and forages in pastures and sprayfields. Application of the DyNoFlo model to small, medium, and large dairy farms showed that they could decrease their N leaching by 9, 20, and 25 %, respectively, without reducing profits by varying management strategies according to ENSO phases...|$|R

Surface waters were tested for pathogenic bacteria indicators fecal coliform, E. coli, and total coliform {{before and after}} cattle were released onto summer grazing allotments. Water samples were collected from meadow stream sites up to 6 weeks before and up to 6 weeks after cattle grazing began. Streams passing through ungrazed meadow served as controls. Eight sample sites were between 1694 m and 2273 m in elevation; one site was lower at 1145 m in elevation. Samples were transported within 6 hours to a water analysis laboratory, where samples were analyzed following standardized laboratory methods. Results showed that individual site and total mean concentrations of E. coli in surface waters were within regulatory standards before cattle arrived during each of the 3 study years. After the beginning of grazing, mean E. coli counts increased as follows: 2009 from 8 to 240 CFU/ 100 mL, 2010 from 7 to 561 CFU/ 10 mL; 2011 from 7 to 657 CFU/ 100 mL (p < 0. 05 all years).

With this objective, a study was carried out on a greenhouse, where the effect of fertilisation, mycorrhizal fungi inoculation, and amino acid supply were tested. Results showed that cork oak seedling capability to growth, expressed as total seedling dry weight, was positively affected by treatments, except when only fertilisation was applied. We verified that cork oak seedlings inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi presented better results in terms of aerial structures growth. Any of the treatments was suitable to contribute positively for tap root and total belowground dry weight accumulation. Only fine roots structures were sensitive to treatments effects; it was verified that both inoculated and non-inoculated seedlings subjected to fertilisation were capable to invest largely on the production of these structures (33 and 30 %, respectively). To reinforce the cork oak seedling growth, the equilibrium between fertilisers and mycorrhizal fungi inoculation would probably be the better option to enhance the cork oak regeneration process. Thus, the balance between shoot and root systems growth would be guaranteed, fertilisation mainly for root system and mycorrhizal fungi inoculation for shoot growth...|$|R
40|$|Background & Aims: Climate {{change will}} likely modify {{patterns}} of precipitation, with an expected increase in frequency {{and magnitude of}} extreme events. The Mediterranean area {{seems to be very}} sensitive to such events, but their effect on ecosystem services, such as plant productivity, is widely unknown. Here we evaluate the short-term effect of an experimental precipitation gradient on the above ground net primary productivity (ANPP) of mesic and xeric sub-Mediterranean grassland systems over two consecutive years. Study sites: Torricchio Nature Reserve, Central Apennines, Italy. Mesic (north-facing) and xeric (south-facing) grasslands are differentiated in geophysical and edaphic properties. Methods: In both systems, a gradient of declining precipitation was obtained using additional rainfall, ambient rainfall and reduced rainfall for two years (2011, 2012). ANPP of the system as well as its functional groups was measured after the period of rainfall manipulation. An increase of ANPP and its variability with rainfall availability in each study year was analysed with monotonic trend tests (Jonckheere-Terpstra Test, Neuhauser-Hothorn Test) Main Results & Interpretations: A significant increase of the ANPP due to increased rainfall appeared only in the mesic system in the year 2012. This response was driven by the increased productivity of perennial forbs while grasses showed little changes. Comparing our findings of two different <b>climatic</b> <b>years</b> we conclude that positive effects of an increased precipitation on ANPP could be weakened by dry springs which might influence plant growth of the entire growing season. In sum, precipitation variation can have noticeable implications for sub-Mediterranean montane grassland productivity depending on local functional group composition and the amount of early season precipitation on ANPP...|$|R

The articulation of these two kinds of <b>climatic</b> <b>years</b> is noncongruent by one-half a quarter; e. g., the quarter delineated by the Spring Equinox and the Summer Solstice divides into a Hot-Dry (but transitioning to Wet) first half and a Hot-Wet second half; the shift occurs at the time immediately after the May Cross-Quarter day, {{which is also the}} water festival of Holy Cross. A similar dissonance occurs in the quarter running from the Autumnal Equinox to the Winter Solstice, the first half being Cold-Wet (but transitioning to Dry), and the second Cold-Dry, shifting near the November Mid-Quarter day when All Saints" is celebrated. Only the half-quarters bracketing the Summer and Winter Solstices are congruent. Weather data from the zone support these interpretations. Further evidence for disarticulated seasons comes from the staggered times of seasonal shift, from the placement of festivals and pilgrimages, and from parallels with human gestation, maize growth, and the human life cycle. These beliefs about when rains should begin or end and when warmth arises or abates to cold organize farming practices. Pilgrimages are made to influence deities to regulate water; most of these are concentrated around Cross-Quarter days. Many fiestas celebrated in home villages call for steady rain at the time of strongest plant growth. Others attend to patron and other local saints, including sacred natural landscape features, and may also be water related. Pilgrimages to distant sites initiate calls for rain (February, La Candelaria or San Caralampio) and requests for drying (September, San Matéo Ixtatán). Such climatic and cultural events structure Mayans" manipulation of water and organize faming practices, and they underscore the vegetative metaphor for the reproduction of all life, human and animal, as well as plant...|$|R
40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{is one of}} {{the three}} most {{important}} greenhouse gases (GHG). Nitrous oxide emissions currently account for approximately one third of GHG emissions from agriculture in Ireland. Emissions of N 2 O arise naturally from soil sources and from the application of nitrogen (N) in the form of N fertilizers and N in dung and urine deposition by grazing animals at pasture. Nitrous oxide emission measurements were conducted at three different scales. Firstly, a large-scale field experiment was undertaken to compare emission rates from a pasture receiving three different rates of N fertilizer application and to identify the effects of controlling variables over a two-year period. Variation in emission rates was large both within and between <b>years.</b> Two contrasting <b>climatic</b> <b>years</b> were identified. The cooler and wetter conditions in year 1 gave rise to considerably lower emission levels than the warmer and drier year 2. However, in both years, peak emissions were associated with fertilizer N applications coincident with rainfall events in the summer months. A small-plot study was conducted to identify the individual and combined effects of fertilizer, dung and urine applications to grassland. Treatment effects were however, difficult to obtain due to the overriding effects of environmental variables. Thirdly, {{through the use of a}} small-scale mini-lysimeter study, the diurnal nature of N 2 O emission rates was identified for two distinct periods during the year. The occurrence of a diurnal pattern has important implications for the identification of a measurement period during the day which is representative of the true daily flux. The research presented aims to identify the nature and magnitude of N 2 O emissions and the factors which affect emission rates from a grassland in Ireland.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{projected}} to increase water resources limitation and to impact significantly agricultural production. A big challenge for agriculture will be {{to reduce the amount}} of water used to fit the environmental constraints, while maintaining a level of production that ensure food security. In this context, we develop a methodology based on high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data combined with a semi-empirical crop model coupling the Simple Algorithm For Yield estimates (SAFY, Duchemin et al., 2008, 2015) with the new formulation (Battude et al., 2016) to a water balance model adapted from the FAO- 56 method (Allen et al., 1998). A module was added to automatically simulate irrigation. The model was used to assess the dynamics of actual Evapotranspiration (ETca) and water supplies of maize crop over large areas and during contrasted <b>climatic</b> <b>years</b> in the south west of France. It was first calibrated and evaluated over an experimental field using four years of ETca measurements. The validation was done over 18 maize fields and larger irrigated zones (135 ha to 450 ha) using total irrigation depths. This work permitted to quantify the ability of different methods to estimate the storage capacity (soil map vs in situ data) and the basal crop coefficient Kcb (standard vs remotely sensed values) and their impact on total irrigation depths. Good estimations were obtained for ETca (R= 0. 88; RRMSE= 20 %). The model also reproduced correctly the total irrigation depth over the 18 maize fields (R= 0. 79; RRMSE= 18. 8 %) and three larger irrigated zones (R= 0. 8; RRMSE= 42 %). The underestimation (Bias = - 93 mm) is due to several reasons such as errors in soil water storage capacity estimates, but also to an overestimation of water needs by water managers or a potential over-irrigation carried out by farmers. Finally, the work demonstrates the high potential of combining a simple agro-meteorological model using only few parameters with satellite imagery for a large-scale monitoring of total irrigation depth...|$|R

40|$|Breeding {{objectives}} were developed for meat sheep in smallholder production circumstances in the tropics. The traits considered were litter size, lambing frequency, pre-weaning, and post-weaning lamb survival to 12 months, ewe survival, lamb live weight at 12 -month, mature ewe live weight, consumable meat, kg of manure DM sold per ewe {{per year and}} residual DM feed intake. Three evaluation situations were considered: (i) base with constant number of ewes, (ii) fixed feed resource and (iii) setting feed costs to zero. Sensitivity analysis of economic values to price levels of inputs and meat production was carried out. The fixed feed resource situation appropriately describes smallholder production circumstances. In the base situation, meat production accounted for about 88 % of revenue and manure the remaining 12 %. Variable costs represented about 95 % of the total cost. For the fixed feed resource situation, economic values (US$ per ewe per year) were 12. 94 for litter size, 10. 18 for lambing frequency, 0. 19 for pre-weaning lamb survival, 0. 24 for post-weaning lamb survival, 0. 36 for ewe survival, 1. 02 for 12 -month lamb live weight, 0. 14 for mature ewe live weight, 0. 51 for consumable meat, 0. 08 for kg of manure DM sold (per ewe per year) and - 0. 04 for residual DM feed intake. Litter size and lambing frequency {{were the most important}} traits in a breeding objective for smallholder production. Relative to the base situation, setting feed costs to zero had similar results as the situation with restricted feed resource but resulted in larger differences. Sensitivity analysis of economic weights to changes in prices and production circumstances indicated that future economic values for traits might change dependent on levels of output and prices. The exceptions, with regard to changes in meat price are kg of manure DM sold per ewe per year and residual DM feed intake, and with regard to feed costs are consumable meat and kg of manure DM sold per ewe per year. Economic values for 12 -month lamb live weight, mature ewe live weight, consumable meat, kg of manure DM sold per ewe per year and residual DM feed intake were not sensitive to changes in management and marketing circumstances. Caution is recommended when the breeding objectives presented here are applied not to disadvantage smallholders in poor <b>climatic</b> <b>years,</b> when farmers are at their most vulnerable situation.

40|$|Forest {{dynamics}} {{will depend}} upon the physiological performance of individual tree species under more stressful conditions caused by climate change. In order to compare the idiosyncratic responses of Mediterranean tree species (Quercus faginea, Pinus nigra, Juniperus thurifera) coexisting in forests of central Spain, we evaluated the temporal changes in secondary growth (basal area increment; BAI) and intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE) during the last four decades, determined how coexisting species are responding to increases in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (C a) and drought stress, and assessed the relationship among iWUE and growth during climatically contrasting years. All species increased their iWUE (ca. + 15 to + 21 %) between the 1970 s and the 2000 s. This increase {{was positively related to}} C a for J. thurifera and to higher C a and drought for Q. faginea and P. nigra. During climatically favourable years the study species either increased or maintained their growth at rising iWUE, suggesting a higher CO 2 uptake. However, during unfavourable <b>climatic</b> <b>years</b> Q. faginea and especially P. nigra showed sharp declines in growth at enhanced iWUE, likely caused by a reduced stomatal conductance to save water under stressful dry conditions. In contrast, J. thurifera showed enhanced growth also during unfavourable years at increased iWUE, denoting a beneficial effect of C a even under climatically harsh conditions. Our results reveal significant inter-specific differences in growth driven by alternative physiological responses to increasing drought stress. Thus, forest composition in the Mediterranean region might be altered due to contrasting capacities of coexisting tree species to withstand increasingly stressful conditions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

40|$|Em regiões semi-áridas como parte do Nordeste do Brasil (NEB) reservatórios hidrícos artificiais são essências para acumular água no período chuvoso e suprir sua demanda por liberação no período seco. Por este fato, é importante o conhecimento da variabilidade pluviométrica na bacia hidrográfica desses reservatórios. Os resultados aqui apresentados mostram comparações entre dados observados e simulação via modelagem dinâmica para a bacia do Açude Castanhão-Ce com ênfase a escala intra-sazonal. A variabilidade interanual da precipitação intrasazonal (1971 - 2000) simulada pelo modelo {{regional}} espectral (MRE) tem um erro sistemático que subestima os totais observados (pentadais e quinzenais), principalmente no período de fevereiro a maio, e superestima esses totais em janeiro e junho. Entretanto, foram verificadas também maiores (menores) diferenças quantitativas nesses totais na subestimativa nas décadas de 1970 - 1980 - 1990 e 1990 - 2000. Para anos de constraste climáticos (La Niña, El Niño e Normais), o MRE nas escalas pentadal, quinzenal e mensal capturou com bom desempenho o sinal da anomalia relacionado à precipitação observada predominando anomalia positiva para os anos de La Niña e em torno da média a negativa para os anos Normais e de El Niño, em particular durante fevereiro a maio. Essa característica foi também verificada nos dados de precipitação observada na bacia. In arid regions as northeast part of Brazil (NEB) {{artificial water}} reservoirs are essences to accumulate {{water in the}} rainy period and to supply its demand for release in the dry period. For this fact, {{the knowledge of the}} pluviometric variability in the hydrographic basin of these reservoirs is important. The results presented here show comparisons between observed data and simulation from dynamic modeling for the basin of the Castanhão-Ce Dam with emphases the intra seasonal scale. The interanual variability of intra-seasonal precipitation (1971 - 2000) simulated by the spectral regional model (MRE) has a systematic bias that underestimation the observed totals (pentads and biweekly), mainly in the period of February the May, and overestimates these totals in January and June. However, were also verified bigger (lesser) quantitative differences in these totals in the sub estimation in the decades of 1970 - 1980 - 1990 e (1990 - 2000). For <b>climatic</b> <b>years</b> of contrast (La Niña, El Niño and Normal), the MRE in the scales pentad, biweekly and monthly captured with good performance the signal of the anomaly in relation to the precipitation observed, predominating positive anomaly for the years of La Niña, and around the average the refusal for the Normal years and of El Niño, in particular during February the May. This characteristic also was verified in the precipitation data observed in the basin...|$|R
40|$|Sound {{propagation}} in {{the lower}} atmosphere strongly depends on the wind direction and the vertical gradients in the speed of sound. The latter depends in turn on the vertical gradients of wind velocity and temperature. Because of the natural space and time fluctuations in microclimatic conditions, the acoustic level at a large distance from the source must {{be considered as a}} random variable. Therefore, knowing the statistical characteristics of the fluctuations in microclimatic conditions is of great importance for estimating the accuracy of a measurement or a calculation of long-range acoustic levels. We describe a method based on a heat and mass transfer simulation model, for estimating hourly variations in local wind and temperature profiles. Two types of inputs are required: - site descriptors (soil and vegetation parameters acting on the surface energy and water balances: albedo, roughness length, soil type [...] .); - standard climatic data provided by the meteorological network (insolation, wind velocity and direction, air temperature and humidity, precipitation [...] .). Using long-term (i. e., several <b>years)</b> <b>climatic</b> data files, it is possible to calculate statistical distributions of the vertical wind and temperature gradients at some height above the surface, as well as the distribution of the vertical sound velocity gradient. For a given source-receiver configuration, the corresponding distribution function of sound levels can then be deduced. The method is illustrated by a case study perfomed with a 30 <b>year</b> <b>climatic</b> file for a typical rural site in France. As an example, we calculated the fraction of time during which the sound level exceeded a prescribed threshold, for one particular source-receiver configuration...|$|R
