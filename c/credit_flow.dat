50|$|There {{was a sharp}} {{increase}} in sub-prime loans in 2006. Now the borrowers could borrow even 99 percent of their investments.

The leverage ratio is the ratio between the funds borrowed by banks and the banks' own assets.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirical and theoretical knowledge of gross credit flows: the simultaneous process of credit expansion and contraction associated with a net change in the aggregate quantity of credit. Empirically, the paper summarizes heterogeneity in the banking industry by estimating gross <b>credit</b> <b>flows</b> for the entire US banking system between 1979 and 1999. The empirical exercise shows that sizeable gross flows coexist at any phase of the cycle, even within narrowly defined regional units and bank size categories. Furthermore, the paper finds that aggregate credit contraction is a concentrated series, which implies that a burst in credit contraction is followed by prolonged periods of low contraction. Theoretically, the paper proposes a matching model in which financiers have to spend time and resources to expand credit to heterogeneous entrepreneurs.

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} {{the presence of a}} creditless economic recovery in Eastern Europe, after de 2008 - 2009 output collapse. To this end, we use three variables: credit stock, <b>credit</b> <b>flow</b> and money supply M 1. We find that the changes in the <b>credit</b> <b>flow,</b> as percentage of GDP, are the most distinctly correlated with the GDP rate. During the growth recovery, the <b>credit</b> <b>flow</b> tends to rise in six of the surveyed countries, although the credit stock declines in some cases. On the other side, the liquid segment of money supply (M 1) registered in some countries strong rebounds that boosted demand recovery, due not so much to credit but to the liquidity preference. Within domestic demand, we notice a steeper decline of the fixed capital formation than the consumption one, but also a stronger subsequent upturn. The investment recovery seems to be supported in most of countries by the <b>credit</b> <b>flow</b> growth; there is a stronger dependence of capital formation on the newly created credit than in the case of consumption, which is rather correlated with the whole money supply M 1. In conclusion, we can say that there was a 9 ̆ 3 creditless recovery 9 ̆ 4 phenomenon in Eastern Europe after the global crisis, but most countries recorded an increase of <b>credit</b> <b>flow</b> along with the GDP. The new flow of money is mostly used for investment and consumption, and thus supports the revival of domestic demand, especially in countries with a less developed financial system, such as the emerging european ones. On the other hand, the trend in the liquid part of the money supply may evolve, especially in times of financial instability, regardless of credit developments.
