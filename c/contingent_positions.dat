Despite these traditional gender roles for women, Japan's government aims to enhance the economy by improving the labor policies for mothers with Abenomix (2013), an economy revitalization strategy. Yoon believes Abenomix represents a desire to remedy the effects of an aging population rather than a desire to promote gender equality. Evidence for the conclusion is the finding that women are entering the workforce in <b>contingent</b> <b>positions</b> for a secondary income and a company need of part-time workers based on mechanizing, outsourcing and subcontracting. Therefore, Yoon states that women's participation rates {{do not seem to}} be influenced by government policies but by companies' necessities. The Global Gender Gap Report 2015 established that Japan's economic participation and opportunity ranking (106th), 145th being the broadest gender gap, dropped from 2014 [...] "due to lower wage equality for similar work and fewer female legislators, senior officials and managers".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a political economy approach to explaining {{the role of}} business in international environmental governance. The framework bridges micro and macro-levels of analysis and combines theories of International Relations with perspectives from management and organization. The uneven and fragmented nature of international governance is viewed as {{the outcome of a}} process of bargaining, compromise, and alliance formation among a range of state and non-state actors. Negotiated regimes are constitutive of the broader structures of global governance, but are also constrained and shaped by these wider configurations of power. We apply Gramscian concepts to understand processes of contestation and accommodation, and to locate corporate political strategy within the wider system of states, civil society, and international institutions. The Gramscian approach suggests the dominant yet <b>contingent</b> <b>position</b> of business, and points to a strategic concept of power that highlights the dynamic and somewhat indeterminate path of regime evolution.

40|$|Housing {{is one of}} {{the pillars}} of the welfare state. It is, however, one of the least {{developed}} and most market-determined domains of social provision. In Portugal, as in other southern European countries, housing occupies a <b>contingent</b> <b>position</b> with complex social, historical, and nationally-specific political factors bearing upon it. By using statistical data and a literature review, this paper will provide an overview of the key factors shaping the housing system in Portugal in recent decades. We demonstrate the critical importance of housing in the Portuguese economy and society in regard to its significant share of GDP, national debt, and the high percentage of families who cannot afford satisfactory housing in the private sector. Among the main conclusions of this study are the inability of the state to regulate the property market and urban dynamics and contribute efficiently to the satisfaction of housing needs. Furthermore, land regulation and urban policies based on the growth-dependent paradigm raise questions not only regarding their adequacy in a crisis period, but also in terms of the sustainability of this paradigm...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} contingent work arrangements of youths {{and young adults}} during the 1980 s and early 1990 s. The research question is why young people held contingent work positions during this time period. The two competing explanations addressed in this dissertation for why people worked in <b>contingent</b> <b>positions</b> are the supply-side theory and the demand-side theory. The supply-side theory posits that workers hold <b>contingent</b> <b>positions</b> because these jobs offer preferred work conditions, while the demand-side theory contends that employers use contingent work positions for the flexibility these jobs offer in terms of reduced labor costs and obligations. The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a nationally representative sample of 12, 686 females and males, is utilized to test these explanations. Event history procedures are used. ^ Both the supply- and demand-side theories were useful in explaining why young people during the 1980 s and early 1990 s worked in <b>contingent</b> <b>positions.</b> Women {{were more likely to}} work in contingent employment and being married and having children increased the likelihood. Black women were surprisingly more likely than non-Hispanic women to hold contingent jobs, but this was at least partly explained by interactions of family income levels with marital status and having young children. The effect of marital status on the odds that men worked in <b>contingent</b> <b>positions</b> varied with age, and the effect of school enrollment varied by age for the full sample. These age interactions revealed that the direction of the marital status effect among men and enrollment status effect for the sample changed direction, contrary to hypotheses. ^ There was also some support for the demand-side explanation for contingent work. Support for the dual labor market demand-side theory was that black males and females were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to make transitions from contingent jobs to unemployment, blacks and females had lower pay in contingent and non-contingent positions, and that all females, regardless of marital status, were more likely to hold contingent employment relative to men. The insignificance of the Hispanic coefficient in most of the analyses and the occasional insignificance of education level in predicting contingent work suggested that non-contingent positions were not necessarily reserved for non-Hispanic whites with higher education levels, providing possible support for the flexibility demand-side theory. ...|$|E

40|$|Nationwide in the United States, 70 % {{of faculty}} members in higher {{education}} are employed off the tenure-track. Nearly all of these non-tenure-track (NTT) appointments share a quality that may produce stress for those who hold them: contingency. Most NTT appointments are contingent on budget, enrollment, or both, {{and the majority of}} contingent faculty members are hired for one quarter or semester at a time. Significant research has investigated the effects of contingency on teaching, students, departments, colleges, and universities; however, little research has focused on the psychological experiences of NTT faculty. The current study examined perceptions of workplace stressors and harm, organizational commitment, common coping mechanisms, and depression, anxiety and stress among NTT faculty using a longitudinal design that spanned two to four months. Results indicate that NTT faculty perceive unique stressors at work that are related to their <b>contingent</b> <b>positions.</b> Specific demographic characteristics and coping strategies, inability to find a permanent faculty position, and commitment to one’s organization predispose NTT faculty to perceive greater harm and more sources of stress in their workplaces. Demographic characteristics, lower income, inability to find a permanent faculty position, disengagement coping mechanisms (e. g., giving up, denial), and organizational commitment were associated with the potential for negative outcomes, particularly depression, anxiety, and stress. Our findings suggest possibilities for institutional intervention. Overall, we argue that universities would be well-served by attending to the needs of NTT faculty on campus in order to mitigate negative outcomes for institutions, students, and faculty...|$|E

40|$|Within the now {{extensive}} recent {{literature on}} cultures of nature, agriculture has received less attention than {{might have been}} expected given its threshold role in transforming human relations with the earth and with plants and animals. The concept and practice of agriculture can be understood as central to the emergence and maintenance of the culture/nature dichotomy within Western thought and practice. In this paper we use the comparative cases of Sweden and Australia to examine the differential and <b>contingent</b> <b>positioning</b> of agriculture with respect to that which is understood as nature. Broadly speaking, some parts of agriculture are understood to belong to nature in Sweden through a long history. This is not the case in Australia, where the short agricultural history is positioned in contrast to nature. This affects the way in which biodiversity and environmental protection takes place - in Sweden as part of farming, - in Australia in spite of it. We argue that these cultural differences have been more important than generally recognised in debates over multifunctional agriculture.

40|$|The {{parties that}} have adopted principled or <b>contingent</b> <b>positions</b> opposed to {{participation}} in European integration span {{most of the}} political spectrum. Yet even a cursory glance at the European scene reveals that the mainstream center-left and right parties rend not to adopt principled Euro-skepticism, although they may oppose aspects of European integration when policy preferences clash. With a few significant exceptions, principled opposition has been constrained to parties at the flanks of the system or parties that represent specific interests or identities. Starting with the premise that a party's decision to adopt or modify a Euro-skeptic stance is a strategic decision, this paper explores the roots of party-based Euro-skepticism and the dynamics of its persistence and change. Party strategy is linked inextricably to the party's position in the party system, and {{is made up of}} the party's efforts to reconcile the four main goals that almost define political parties: organizational survival, and the pursuit of policy, votes and office. Although many, if not most, parties pursue strategies that are associated with the catch-all or cartel model of political parties, a significant number of parties have chosen alternative or mixed strategies. Parties' propensities for and incentives regarding Euro-skepticism are explored in relation to those different strategies. [W]hy do parties adopt Euro-skeptic positions, and why do they change these? The "taming of the shrew," or softening of Euro-skepticism, may be driven by changes in any of the four goals or the context in which they are pursued, or a combination thereof...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on {{eighteen}} months fieldwork in the Ese Ejja community of Portachuelo, on the lower Beni River, in northern Bolivia. The Ese Ejja are an indigenous Amazonian people of the Tacana linguistic family. The thesis analyses Ese Ejja ideas of alterity and demonstrates that such ideas are {{the basis for the}} construction of identity. Alterity must constantly be created and maintained, however, 'others' pose a constant threat and, therefore, difference must also be eliminated through conviviality and procreation. Drawing on socio-cosmological ideas, myth and everyday life experiences, the argument focuses on the Ese Ejja's ambivalent sentiments towards non-indigenous people, who are considered the epitome of otherness. These sentiments are characterised by both fear and avoidance, and, at the same time, by emulation. Vis-a-vis non-indigenous people, the Ese Ejja display a form of self-deprecation, expressed in the statement that they themselves are not 'the true people'. The thesis analyses the relationship between culturally shared and individually held ideas. Among the Ese Ejja, self-deprecation is the dominant discourse, but ideas vary from person to person and they transform over the course of people's lives. And it is through individual and collective transformations that dominant cultural constructs are refashioned and reproduced. Thus, the thesis stresses the importance of giving voice to the contrasting and contradicting ideas that exist in any social group. It concludes that Ese Ejja identity - constructed through alterity - is better understood as a <b>contingent</b> <b>position</b> rather than an absolute essence. Finally, it is suggested that the notion of not being 'the true people' is rooted in indigenous perceptions of history, viewed as a progressive rapprochement with the non-indigenous peoples...|$|R

Controls and nontactile-extinction groups performed better when the hands were in anatomical than in crossed position. By contrast, patients with tactile extinction detected contralesional stimuli with higher accuracy in crossed than in anatomical position. This result suggests that, in these patients, impairments in detecting contralesional stimuli can be due not only to sensory but also to spatial factors <b>contingent</b> upon the <b>position</b> of the hands. There was no interaction between the effect of crossing the hands and the hemispace where the crossing took place.

Here we show that a direct intracortical input {{can be added to}} a BMI to instruct rhesus monkeys in choosing the direction of reaching movements generated by the BMI. Somatosensory instructions were provided to two monkeys operating the BMI using either: (a) vibrotactile stimulation of the monkey's hands or (b) multi-channel intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) delivered to the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) in one monkey and posterior parietal cortex (PP) in the other.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between firm resources, positioning strategies and performance in the smaller firm. Porter’s generic strategies have been useful in describing how firms compete in the marketplace, and the resource based view has shown that resources {{can lead to a}} sustained competitive advantage. The strategic management field has begun to combine the two theories and examine the link between them. Small firms must make the best use of their relatively scarce resources. It is proposed that {{the relationship between}} resources and performance is <b>contingent</b> upon the <b>positioning</b> strategy the firm competes on, although there has only been limited supporting research to date. This research builds on work by Edelman et al. (2005) by examining the relationship between human, organisational and physical resources, and the strategies of quality/ customer service, innovation, and cost leadership in 447 retail, engineering, and professional service firms in New Zealand. Using Structural Equations Modelling this research finds that positioning strategies are the mechanism by which firms can leverage their resources into higher performance. This relationship can be modelled as mediated or moderated, with statistical analysis sensitive to model complexity. The firm’s environment influences this relationship with different resources required to support each position depending on the industry. Specifically human, organisational, and physical resources appear to be viable sources of competitive advantage when they are leveraged by a strategy of quality/ customer service, innovation or cost leadership when the industry environment is conducive to the resource – strategy combination...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The question this proposal addresses {{is whether the}} limits of the perceptual span is due to purely visual constraints of parafoveal acuity or to attentional constraints of reading. By implementing a new reading paradigm, it is possible to separate the contributions of acuity and attention. Specifically, displayed text was modified <b>contingent</b> on the <b>position</b> of the reader’s fixation location such that parafoveal information is magnified. We call this the “parafoveal magnification” (PM) paradigm because parafoveal information appears larger, functionally equalising its perceptual impact with concurrent foveal information. 			After implementing PM software, we ran and analysed two experiments. In Experiment 1, participants’ eye movements were monitored while reading normal and PM text. We additionally manipulated window size (7 -, 14 -, or 21 -character window, or no-window). Releasing the constraints of visual acuity via PM allowed us to assess whether the attentional span in reading is equivalent to the “perceptual span” as assessed by prior experiments. Finally, we repeated a set of sentences under normal and PM presentation conditions (normal-then-PM vs. PM-then- normal). Experiment 2 investigated the parafoveal-on-foveal effect – in which the ease or difficulty in processing word n+ 1 is reflected in the fixation duration on word n. In this experiment, we manipulated both the word frequency and plausibility of target words in sentences that were presented with PM. 			Although PM induced physically longer saccades (in pixels) versus normal text, the saccade length in terms of number of characters was the same in both situations. Thus, the attentional span seems to be delineated in terms of amount of information rather than a physical metric (visual angle). These results confirm that the perceptual span seems to be limited by attentional rather than visual constraints. The physical size of the attentional span adapts to the amount of information to process. Finally, our results indicate that readers are able to immediately adapt their saccadic programs depending on the display type. 			 		 Project description: In reading, during each eye fixation, only part of a text is available for processing as visual acuity drops off rapidly from the centre of fixation. About 6 - 8 characters of text typically fall within the fovea, or central high-acuity area of vision. Outside this area, the parafovea, visual acuity decreases the further the distance from fixation. Nevertheless, useful information is extracted parafoveally, as demonstrated in reading tasks where such information is denied and the reading rate is significantly slowed. The perceptual span is that region of text from which useful information can be extracted, extending from approximately 3 characters to the left to 14 characters to the right of fixation. The asymmetry of this span is taken to reflect attentional demands of reading – in left-to-right languages, like English, new information is located to the right of fixation. This proposal devises a 'parafoveal magnification' paradigm. Text will be modified <b>contingent</b> on the <b>position</b> of the reader’s fixation location with parafoveal information enlarged, functionally equalising its perceptual impact with concurrent foveal information. Results will address whether {{the limits of the}} perceptual span are due to purely visual constraints of acuity or to attentional constraints of reading...|$|R

40|$|Bilateral CVA as {{currently}} implement has the counterintuitive ef-fect of profiting from one’s own widening CDS spreads, i. e. {{increased risk of}} default, in practice 1. The unified picture of CVA and liquidity introduced by Morini & Prampolini 2010 has contributed to under-standing this. However, there are two significant omissions for prac-tical implementation that {{come from the same}} source, i. e. positions not booked in usual position-keeping systems. The first omission is firm-level positions that change value upon firm default. An example is Goodwill which is a line item on balance sheets and typically written down to zero on default. Another example would be firm Equity. The second omission relates to collateralized positions. When these posi-tions are out of the money in future, which has a positive probability, they will require funding that cannot be secured using the <b>position</b> it-self. These <b>contingent</b> future funding <b>positions</b> are usually not booked in any position-keeping system. We show here how to include these two types of positions and thus help to complete the unified picture of CVA and liquidity.

This paper investigates the individual welfare consequences of di¤erent plans. We used the recent transition from de 8 ̆ 5 ned bene 8 ̆ 5 t to de 8 ̆ 5 ned contribution for white-collar workers in Sweden as the benchmark for our analysis. The framework for our analysis is a life cycle model of a borrowing-constrained individuals consumption- and portfolio choices {{in the presence of}} uncertain labour income. The main result is that individuals with the characteristic of a low expected pre-retirement income relative to average income and high variance in earnings are winners (men with university degree in the private sector), and that those with the opposite characteristic (women with university degree in the public sector) would be losers.

40|$|L’emploi traditionnel éclate de plus en plus pour donner naissance à une grande diversité d’emplois {{atypique}}s. Ce nouveau phénomène, qui est encore mal connu, pose de nombreux défis tant aux gestionnaires qu’aux travailleurs et à la société. Un des problèmes majeurs pour gérer ces enjeux est la difficulté de cerner adéquatement l’ampleur et {{la nature}} des transformations actuelles parce que les différentes formes de travail atypique n’ont pas encore été clairement définies. La contribution de cet article est de clarifier les différentes formes de travail à l’aide de deux typologies, une typologie des formes de travail et une typologie des travailleurs. L’étude révèle que plusieurs défis importants posés par cette nouvelle réalité dépendent à la fois de la forme de travail atypique concernée et des caractéristiques des travailleurs. During the past decades, {{the environment for}} organizations has become increasingly unpredictable. They are compelled to become more flexible, especially {{through the use of}} contingent employment (Cappelli et al. 1997). Statistics indicate a relative decrease of traditional employment over the past twenty years, whereas contingent employment has increased dramatically. This raises new issues for managers, workers, and society in general (Hipple 1998; Matte 1998; Simard 1998). Although numerous authors acknowledge the rapid growth of contingent employment (e. g., Betcherman 1995; Kochan et al. 1994; Lévesque 1999), little progress has been made toward the understanding of the complexity of the issues raised. One of the reasons for this is the absence of a common definition of contingent employment (Simard 1988), which renders comparisons among studies virtually impossible. Another problem is the heterogeneity of contingent workers (Eberhardt and Moser 1995; Simard 1998; Walsh and Deery 1999). This article posits that researchers and managers can only address the challenges posed by nonstandard employment if they comprehend the diversity of contingent employment. We therefore propose a typology of jobs and a typology of workers in order to better understand the reality of contingent employment. The first typology constitutes an attempt to classify jobs according to their features. Traditional employment is defined as a permanent position (i. e., an open-term contract), with a full-time, regular schedule, and where the work is being performed at the employer’s location. Contingent employment differs from this definition on four characteristics: the type of employment contract, the place of work, the number of hours worked, and the regularity of work schedules. These four characteristics constitute the four dimensions of our typology of jobs. Three types of employment contracts may be offered by an organization. The traditional employment contract, often referred to as permanent employment, does not stipulate any specific date for the termination of the employment relationship. The second type of contract indicates a specific date for the termination of employment and {{is often referred to as}} temporary employment. It provides more flexibility to the organization and less certainty for most workers. Finally, independent contracting is a situation in which the relationship ends upon the completion of specified tasks. The place where the work is performed is the second dimension of this typology. Whereas independent contractors have never performed their duties exclusively at their place of employment, permanent and temporary workers customarily did so. However, in recent years, the growth of telecommuting indicates that jobs are moving away from the employer’s premises. An employment contract may be based either on an averaged full-week of work (i. e., more than 35 hours of work) or on an averaged reduced-week of work, irrespective of the type of contract. The number of hours worked is only one dimension of the work schedule. The regularity of schedule is the other dimension, and this plays a crucial role in defining the certainty of earnings. These four dimensions allow us to profile 18 different forms of employment, of which only two can be described as traditional (permanent full-time and part-time). This typology emphasizes the fact that nonstandard employment may take a large variety of very different forms, which vary in terms of precariousness, task variety, and ability to reconcile work and private life. However, a typology of jobs does not suffice to capture the fact that individuals may hold more than one type of job. In order to understand the reality of contingent workers, a second typology is necessary. Multiple job holding is one dimension along which workers may differ. While most people with a permanent, full-time employment contract do not hold another job, many workers in a <b>contingent</b> <b>position</b> do hold more than one such position (Krahn 1995). Those workers may hold multiple positions simultaneously or successively, sometimes with a gap between each position. The duration of employment over a one-year period is therefore an important dimension to consider when categorizing contingent workers. The third dimension is the desirability of employment form. While some contingent workers may have chosen their employment status (e. g., permanent part-timers), workers in other forms of employment may be less likely to have chosen their particular status (e. g., full-time temporary workers). Studies indicate that the choice of status influences work-related attitudes and behaviours (Armstrong-Stassen, Horsburgh and Cameron 1994; Bishop, Okori-Dankwa and McKether 1993). A better understanding of the variety of contingent workers calls for more diverse and individualized human resource management practices in order to better serve the various needs of employees. For example, mobilization strategies aimed at involuntary temporary workers ought to be different than those targeting voluntary independent contractors. Companies using contingent employees must take account of these differences, while maintaining the equity in treatment that is necessary to foster harmonious work relationships. At the individual level, this paper highlights the fact that contingent workers experience a large variety of work situations, which differ in terms of certainty, desirability, skills development, and so on. When engaging on the path of contingent employment, workers must be aware of the opportunities and the risks that lie ahead. Last but not least, this article stresses the need for society as a whole to consider the consequences of the development of some second-class jobs with poor working conditions.

40|$|By {{broadening}} and redefining “pop,” {{this thesis}} intends to demonstrate pop’s {{potential to be}} considered {{in a manner that is}} productive for and applicable to contemporary art theory and practice. The research will be presented as a final survey or diachronic exhibition that will demonstrate the development of the series of Gossip Pop performances and exhibitions, together with a written exegesis. The practical component of this research will consist of writing, producing, performing and exhibiting a series of interdisciplinary visual artworks in a range of gallery contexts under the pseudonym or label Gossip Pop. These works, utilising visual and linguistic appropriation, repetition and performative methodologies, are constructed within the confines of their own self-contained Gossip Pop genre, which mimics the tropes of capitalist production and consumption, taking “pop” as an antecedent. “Pop” is broadly defined for the purposes of this project and will be considered in the exegesis in three ways. Firstly, pop will be considered through aspects of the contemporary understanding of popular culture, as this pertains to ideas of mass media communication, specifically celebrity culture and gossip, drawing on the context of late capitalism and the intensification of the form of the commodity. Secondly, pop will be contemplated in relation to the theory and practice of the art historical movement “pop art,” with a particular reference to the work, life and philosophy of Andy Warhol. Finally, the notion of “pop music” as the subject (and methodology) of visual art will be examined, with a focus on two major international exhibitions, Sympathy for the Devil: Art and Rock and Roll since 1967, curated by Dominic Molon for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, September 29, 2007 to January 6, 2008, and Rock-Paper-Scissors, curated by Diederich Diederichson for iii the Kunsthaus Graz, Vienna, 30 June to 30 August, 2009. These notions of pop provide the framework for speculation regarding the role of pop in respect to the epistemological, communicative and socio-political potential for contemporary art practice, including: the productive implications or effects of the “performative” visual artwork, the connotations for (and) ideologies of spectatorship, and conjecture regarding the highly <b>contingent</b> role or <b>position</b> of the artist. This speculation is supported by examples of contemporary art practice that explicate or illuminate aspects of my own work...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on four ethnographic case studies, this dissertation, Humanitarian Psychology in War and Postwar Lebanon, {{examines}} {{the processes of}} psychologizing suffering in Lebanon from Israel’s invasion in 1982 to the Syrian Refugee crisis in 2012. It is {{a study of the}} psychological interventions introduced by humanitarian organizations as a response to war and violence in Lebanon. By tracing the aid ecologies that make specific kinds of subjects possible, this dissertation offers a rethinking of suffering as a subject <b>position</b> <b>contingent</b> on aid and violence in Lebanon. Based on 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork, this study follows the ways in which humanitarian psychology was contested, appropriated and debated by communities in Lebanon. Humanitarian psychology is a form of humanitarian expertise that employs psychiatric diagnoses and therapies to psychologize violence in conflict and post-conflict sites. The first case study addresses the humanitarian trouble in diagnosing trauma following Israel’s invasion in 1982 and the July War 2006. The second case study follows the psychologization process in South Lebanon after the July War, where personality disorders replaced trauma in the making of a therapeutic postwar self. The third case study addresses how new humanitarian therapies sought to prevent domestic violence by treating angry masculinities. The fourth case study focuses on the Syrian refugee crisis that shifted the conditions and relations of aid, enabling new narratives of suffering for Iraqi, Syrian, Sudanese and Palestinian refugees, as well as war-affected Lebanese. My study of the humanitarian psychologization of violence revealed the debates and tensions around violence, psychologization and suffering in Lebanon. Each case study shows a particular formation of aid, resources and care economies that produced specific relations and understandings of violence in Lebanon. The reconfiguration of suffering into psychic injuries depended on different assemblages of techno-moral discourses embedded in humanitarian therapies, NGO-ization and diagnostics. This dissertation also offers contributions to social work practice by providing a critique of the humanitarian trauma model, highlighting the importance of community-based mental health during war. Second, it traces how local social workers in Lebanon negotiate and challenge the work of global humanitarian organizations, as “gatekeepers” of mental health...|$|R
40|$|Partnering {{has been}} the most {{commonly}} used term to describe collaboration between a buyer and its direct supplier. The automotive industry {{has been the}} basis for the development of most studies on the subject. Despite the many studies on partnering, some people share the view that largely missing from the literature is a clear definition of this concept and of how it operates within dyadic (i. e. between a buyer and its direct suppliers), network and firm contexts. This is found to be particularly important if automotive companies geographically spread in the globe are to be properly managed. The purpose of the research presented in this thesis was to explore inter-firm collaboration and partnering between a subsidiary of a motor vehicle manufacturer and its direct suppliers, taking into account the ownership ties of firms, such as those of multinational corporations (MNCs). The objective was to generate new knowledge on how inter-firm collaboration and partnering operate and on the factors that influence the business relationships that are established between the referred companies. The researcher followed a single case study research strategy in order to develop a new and empirically grounded understanding, while favouring contextualisation and complexity. The researcher adopted a triangulated research design in which quantitative and qualitative data were gathered in two stages, through a self-administered mailed questionnaire and in-depth interviews, respectively. The findings suggest that: (a) relationships can be characterised by several dimensions, (i. e. commitment, trust, win-win, long-term orientation, co-ordination, joint problem solving, flexibility, mutual dependence) each of which is a mix of collaborative and non-collaborative elements; (b) a diversified scenario of relationships {{can be explained by the}} different combinations of several contextual factors (i. e. organisational, relational, spatial and network); the importance of each needs to be weighted and hierarchised; (c) the network affects both to enable and constrain the freedom of action at the level of the customer supplier dyad; and (d) partnering is <b>contingent</b> on the <b>position,</b> role and influence at different points in the network. The research argues that relationship management can be enhanced through the application of analytical tools to the assessment of business relationships. New frameworks for analysis are presented as significant contributions to knowledge, among a series of theoretical, methodological and empirical contributions. The researcher suggests directions for research which will further enhance the understanding of inter-firm collaboration and partnering and business relationships within a multinational network context.

40|$|Employer {{demands for}} {{flexible}} work practices {{have seen an}} increase in the diversity of employment relationships illustrated by a global growth of people working in <b>contingent</b> or precarious <b>positions.</b> Increasing evidence suggests that precarious employment is associated with poorer occupational health and safety (OHS) outcomes in terms of injury rates, disease risk and psychological wellbeing. This study used a cross sectional survey of 255 employees to compare the OHS experiences of temporary (N = 156, 61. 2 %) and permanent (N = 99, 38. 8 %) workers employed in three companies involved in the seasonal processing of primary agriculture products (dairy, meat and produce) in two regions of New Zealand. This research identified a clearly definable group of temporary workers (seasonals), who exhibit different characteristics to those commonly associated with precarious employment as they have an expectation of reasonable lengths of fairly secure employment (seasons exceed eight months). Many respondents only undertook one period of employment per year and were re-engaged in subsequent seasons. There are limited opportunities for alternative employment adjacent to these plants. This creates a dependant employment market, potentially putting labour in a weak bargaining position. This is countered by a high overall level of union membership (N = 181, 71 %) and the operation of collective employment contracts. This may be atypical in seasonal industries. Injury numbers were similar (permanent N = 49, 49. 5 %, temporary N = 73, 46. 8 %) and serious injuries (permanent N = 23, 23. 2 %, temporary N = 31, 19. 9 %). Once a factor was introduced to compensate for exposure time, thereby creating a frequency rate, results showed a statistically significant difference with temporary workers suffering injuries and serious injuries with less exposure than their permanent counterparts (t (193. 821) = - 5. 566, p < 0. 05 and (t (236. 928) = - 2. 160, p < 0. 05 respectively). There was a significant difference in chronic injuries with permanent employees being {{more likely to have a}} chronic injury (F 91, 253) = 20. 456, p< 0. 05). Most importantly, using the General Linear Model (logistic regression), when all other influences were controlled for, this research found employment status remained influential in determining whether a respondent was injured at work or not...|$|R
