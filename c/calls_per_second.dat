5|$|Little brown bats produce {{calls that}} are high {{intensity}} frequency modulated (FM) and that last {{from less than}} one millisecond (ms) to about 5 ms and have a sweep rate of 80–40kHz, with most of their energy at 45kHz. Bats usually emit 20 <b>calls</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> when in flight.

25|$|As {{opposed to}} screech owls, scops owls {{have only a}} single type of call. This {{consists}} {{of a series of}} whistles or high-pitched hoots, given with a frequency of 4 <b>calls</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> or less, or of a single, drawn-out whistle. Calls differ widely between species in type and pitch, and in the field are often the first indication of these birds' presence, as well as the most reliable means to distinguish between species. Some, like the recently described Serendib scops owl (Otus thilohoffmanni), were discovered because their vocalizations were unfamiliar to experts in bird-calls.|$|E

The group redirected telephone numbers to different customer support lines, including {{the line for}} World of Warcraft, magnets.com, and the FBI Detroit office. The group claimed this sent five to 20 <b>calls</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> to these sources, overwhelming their support officers. On 24 June 2011, The Guardian released leaked logs {{of one of the}} group's IRC chats, revealing that the core group was a small group of hackers with a leader Sabu who exercised large control over the group's activities. It also revealed that the group had connections with Anonymous, though was not formally affiliated with it. Some LulzSec members had once been prominent Anonymous members, including member Topiary.|$|E

500|$|The adult red-throated loon has {{a number}} of vocalisations, which are used in {{different}} circumstances. In flight, when passing conspecifics or circling its own pond, it gives a series of rapid yet rhythmic goose-like cackles—kaa-kaa-kaa or kak-kak-kak, at roughly five <b>calls</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b> Its warning call, if disturbed by humans or onshore predators, is a short croaking bark. A low-pitched moaning call, used primarily as a contact call between mates and between parents and young, but also during copulation, is made with the bill closed. The species also has a short wailing call—aarOOao...aarOOao...—which descends slightly in pitch and lasts about a second; due to strong harmonics surrounding the primary pitch, this meowing call is more musical than its other calls. Another call—a harsh, pulsed cooing that rises and falls in pitch, and is typically repeated up to 10times in a row—is used in territorial encounters and pair-bonding, and by parent birds encouraging their young to move on land between bodies of water. Known as the [...] "long call", it is often given in duet, which is unusual among the loons; the female's contribution is longer and softer than her mate's.|$|E
2500|$|The {{northern}} screech-owls {{are found}} in eastern states, such as New Jersey and New York. The screech owls are named for their piercing calls. The normal territorial call is not a hoot as with some owls, but a trill consisting of more than 4 individual <b>calls</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> given in rapid succession (although the sound does not resemble screeching or screaming). They also {{have a kind of}} [...] "song" [...] which is used in courtship and, as a duet, between members of a pair. Calls differ widely between species in type and pitch, and in the field are often the first indication of these birds' presence, as well as the most reliable means to distinguish between species. The distinctness of many species of screech owls was first realized when vastly differing calls of externally similar birds from adjacent regions were noted.|$|E

50|$|Ghost frogs {{get their}} name {{as one of}} the six species found in Skeleton Gorge (on Table Mountain), South Africa. The {{underside}} of the body, including the jaw, has small hooks, which help the frogs climb over wet rocks near their habitats. The frogs measure 35 - 45 mm in length. It is in the same size range as Hewitt's ghost frog, but is smaller than Purcell's ghost frog. The top side of its body is brown with yellow spots, and the underside is white. The limbs are plain-colored, and flesh-colored underneath. Their tadpoles take up to two years to develop fully. The call of the royal ghost frog is a harsh, creaking sound, given at around one <b>call</b> <b>per</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{increase}} the number of services and applications in the telecommunication networks a new service architecture has been proposed and specified. The consortia that initiated the new service architecture is called Parlay. Since then, there has been a continued development and 3 GPP the standardization group for 3 G networks, is now cooperating with Parlay. 3 GPP and Parlay are together specifying the Parlay/OSA standard. However, the aim with the new service architecture is to make the art of service development so easy that any software developer should be a potential application developer for telecommunication networks. It is foreseen to be a dramatic increase of new services, but {{it has been shown that}} it is still complex to create new applications. Parlay X is a standard which is an extension of Parlay/OSA, initiated to allow access to the telecommunication network capabilities via web services. The Parlay X architectures include an Application Server (AS), which translates the web service calls to Parlay/OSA commands. A typical AS is a distributed environment sensitive to overload. In this paper we propose and investigate an overload control mechanisms for an AS. The methods have been implemented in a real AS to evaluate the performance. Parlay X is a contract driven architecture, where different service providers have different constraints about minimum number of service <b>calls</b> served <b>per</b> <b>second</b> and maximal delays of different services.
