5|$|In 1960, Kentucky {{had one of}} {{the highest}} dropout rates in the nation, and ranked second only to Arkansas in the number of one-room schools.

40|$|America’s <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> have {{recently}} been thrust into the national spotlight as people look to retrain or find economic alternatives to higher education. This substantial increase in accountability is met with the constraints of financial resources and other limiting factors structured into <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper I examine <b>community</b> <b>college</b> return on investment by states, which govern the responsibility of educating America’s workforce through their diverse <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>systems.</b> To improve America’s postsecondary education competency is to optimize collective action of U. S. state <b>community</b> <b>college</b> <b>systems.</b> While <b>colleges</b> and universities contribute to national education goals, research shows that <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> have and will do much of that work. Return on investment is one key metric that policymakers, by state, can use to deal with and advance community colleges’ heightened call to action...|$|R
