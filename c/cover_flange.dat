40|$|The {{combination}} of reaction calorimetry and supercritical fluids as reactants and/or solvent holds {{great potential for}} the optimization of chemical processes using high pressure near-critical and/or supercritical mixtures. The very specific properties of supercritical fluids and fluid mixtures have been under investigation already from {{the nineteenth century and}} some are quite well understood. But there is still a lack of knowledge in macroscopic properties and raw data for pure fluids and fluid mixtures. This cumulates with the difficulty to apply simple equations of state for the prediction of phase behavior and the calculation of the thermodynamic and the derived transport properties. As a whole, the relatively poor engineering information about supercritical fluids {{is one of the major}} reasons that explains the slow industrial development of supercritical processing. The work presented here concerns the complete development of the new "supercritical reaction calorimetry field", which is in fact the application of reaction calorimetry to supercritical fluids media. As far as we know we are pioneers in this domain as only relatively small scale calorimeters have been successfully used with SCFs and only scarcely. The fact is that the use of reaction calorimetry provides essential information for scale-up purposes. Moreover it allows additional in-line equipment to be used, in order to get complementary information. This renders the reaction calorimeter much lesser specialized and potentially attractive as a tool for industrial application developments. In order to correctly position this project in the scale of laboratory and industrial researches, the first chapter is dedicated to the review of SCFs and SCF mixtures properties, their potential as volatile organic solvent relievers and their actual industrial applications. As a result there is still a great need in engineering data for pure SCFs and their mixtures, although their unique properties make them suitable for several processes, mostly driven by environmental considerations. Classical reaction calorimetry is also shortly discussed with the determination of the technical challenge that arose from the use of a supercritical fluid, as it basically occupies all the available space. Thus we point out that both <b>cover</b> and <b>flange</b> should be separately controlled and adjusted to the inner temperature in order to avoid side heat transfer from the reaction media to those elements. Moreover, the regulation parameters for the jacket and the additional <b>cover</b> and <b>flange</b> should be optimized. This has proved to be difficult as these parameters have been shown to depend strongly on the supercritical carbon dioxide pairs, density and temperature. Nevertheless satisfactory pairs of P, I parameters for all three parts of the reactor have been found using the Ziegler-Nichols approach for the jacket and a pure trial-and-error approach for the two others. The heat transfer with SCFs should be carefully taken into account in order to proceed with correct chemical reactions' evaluation. Heat transfer in scCO 2 and CO 2 -methanol mixtures can be described in stirred tank reactors using the well known Wilson plot methods. The behavior of the internal film heat transfer coefficient with the temperature is drastically different from the one observed for classical liquid systems. In contrast to classic liquids, in supercritical CO 2, the lower the temperature (above the critical point) the higher the internal film heat transfer coefficient. It shows a clear divergence when approaching the critical point. This tendency could be explained by the evolution of the thermodynamical and transport properties of scCO 2 around the critical point. This confirms some observations in the literature with some continuous flow heat transfer apparatuses working with SCFs. The heat transfer coefficients for the <b>cover</b> and the <b>flange</b> have been evaluated and show the same general tendency as the one of the jacket in regard to the temperature. The hydrodynamics of scCO 2 in a stirred tank reactor have been investigated using Laser Doppler Anemometry measurements and indicating that the stirred scCO 2 has a similar behavior with liquid water. However, the turbulent kinetic energy and the mean velocities are 20 % lower for scCO 2, which can be explained by its lower density. Information about the phase behavior during a reaction is essential in order to proceed homogeneously. Under this condition, the system allows for higher reaction rates and for easier process control. This has motivated the complementary development of a video imaging surveillance system for the inside of the reactor, as well as the development of a high pressure variable-volume view cell for the screening of mixtures' phase behavior. As the "top-view" observation is not ideal for phase change observation (no meniscus visualisation), the further development of an in-situ high pressure ultrasonic probe is also provided in this work. Sound speed measurements have been proven to be not only useful as a "phase-change" detector, but also allowed determining the critical point of pure fluids and mixtures. This work also pointed out the real difficulty to combine a homogeneous supercritical reaction media to a sufficiently high heat produced signal. To access the limit of detection of the calorimetric system and to find out the characteristic time constant of the reactor and its variation with temperature and density, we created an amplifier system based on a Labview® interface program. Using some defined functions for the calibration heater released heat, it has been possible to simulate some typical reaction curves and thus validate the heat flow measurements with the supercritical reaction calorimeter...|$|R

40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} has become more challenging the past years and marine operations must be performed in smarter and more cost-effective ways. Waiting on weather should be minimised and design and planning will be of high importance. A marine operation shall be designed to bring an object from one safe condition to another safe condition. A subsea lift consists of different phases that should be evaluated during the planning process, where the through splash zone phase is usually most critical. In order to account for uncertainty in weather forecast, the operation's design criterion is reduced by an alpha-factor. Installations of protection covers are common offshore operations, but only a few hydrodynamic investigations have been performed on such objects. This Master Thesis describes a study aimed at finding as high operational criterion as possible for an installation of a GRP pipeline protection cover. Further investigations were performed on the differences in use of numerical simulations and DNV GL's Simplified Method. The operation's operability was investigated for the two different operational criteria. For a light lift operation, the occurrence of slack in slings are critical and does usually determine the maximum operational sea state. Slack arises when the total hydrodynamic force acting on the object exceeds 90 % of its submerged weight. The lift was simulated for the splash zone phase in the non-linear time domain simulation program, SIMA. The minimum tension that arose in the slings for each wave condition with random seed number, were used to develop a Gumbel distribution. The sea state was categorised as operational if the 10 % quantile, found by an inversed Gumbel CDF, was above the slack requirement. The lifting system consisted of the vessel s crane tip, a crane wire, a hook, a hook winch, four slings, a spreader bar and the cover. The cover was implemented as slender elements in SIMA, were each slender element was given depth dependent added mass and drag. The implemented hydrodynamic parameters were estimated by CFD-analyses. The cover was lifted with an angle of 68 degrees, and the short-term environmental conditions were characterised by short-crested JONSWAP wave spectra. The installation was defined as a weather restricted level B marine operation. The total hydrodynamic force was manually estimated by the Simplified Method. The respective added mass and drag were calculated by use of tabulated coefficients for rectangular flat plates, in two directions; longitudinal and perpendicular to the <b>cover</b> <b>flanges.</b> The total added mass for a rotated cover was found by summing the vertical components of the longitudinal and perpendicular added mass. The largest tension variations occurred right after the cover was fully submerged, hence slamming and varying buoyancy forces could be omitted. The inertia and drag forces were dependent on the most probable largest crane tip motion, found by the crane tip and vessel COG locations. The maximum sea state was assessed by use of linear scaling. The average manually estimated design criterion was 1. 64 m and constant for all peak periods. Hence with an alpha-factor of 0. 76 the operational criterion was 1. 25 m. For each wave condition, 20 - 30 lowering simulations were performed with random seed numbers. The average winch speed was 0. 2 m/s and the cover was lowered to a depth of approximately 33 m. Both the spreader bar and the cover experienced large motions in air. The motions diminished when the cover entered the water. The tension variation in the lifting system increased when the cover entered the splash zone and calmed down when the cover was lowered to 20 meter depth. The simulated design criteria were found by investigating the tension in the lifting slings. No large snap forces were observed after a slack condition. The simulated design criteria were dependent on both significant wave heights and peak periods. The average design criterion was independent of peak periods and determined to be 2. 5 m. Hence with an alpha-factor of 0. 81 the operational criterion was 2 m. The operation can take place if the wave conditions are below the operational criteria over a longer duration than the operation's reference period. The operability was investigated for two fields; Heidrun and Tanzania Block 2. The reference periods were dependent on the water depth, and thus determined to be 2. 5 hours and 9. 3 hours for the two fields respectively. The operability and actual duration of operation with a random start were heavily season dependent, and were studied for both the manually estimated and simulated operational criteria. When the operational criterion increased from 1. 25 m to 2 m the operability increased with 30 - 50 % at both fields. At the same time the actual duration of operation with a random start decreased with up to 80 % at Heidrun. That is, for a given reference period, the waiting on weather decreased with the corresponding. Generally, at both fields the reason of waiting on weather was due to storm periods, where the wave conditions were above the operational criterion. The operational limit was determined by several factors; the installation method, the environmental conditions, the crane tip motion, the alpha-factor and the tension airing in the slings. According to this one can say that an operation should be short {{in order to be able}} to take place often. For increased operational criteria the operability increased and waiting on weather decreased. If the operation should take place at a random time, the risk of waiting on weather will increase. Usually, a marine operation is planned ahead of execution and is based on weather forecasts. Such planning will with a high probability reduce waiting on weather and increase the operation efficiency. In order to determine the highest operational sea state as possible in such a way that waiting on weather can be reduced, simulations should be performed prior to installations of pipeline protection covers.

Since the highest tuned frequency of the prototype cavity with a tuner under the high RF power test condition is measured to be lower than the system specified frequency, a slight dimensional change in the cavity design is required for manufacturing future cavities. In addition to this, an extra dimensional correction is required to compensate the volume changes due to the tuner position and increased port sizes. In the following, the measured frequencies and the estimated frequency shift due to the volume changes are discussed. The correction to the internal dimension of the new cavity design based on the estimated frequency shift is also discussed. I. Frequency Measurement Data Measured frequencies of the prototype single cell cavity with various port terminations are as follows: (a) All four big ports are plugged. The plugs are flush to the cavity inner surface. Frequency is 352. 60 MHz. (b) Four ports are terminated with a loop coupler, one tuner and two plates. The loop coupler is adjusted for matched input and then terminated with a matched load. The tuner is adjusted for the frequency of 351. 93 MHz. (c) Frequency is measured under the high power test condition with vacuum (� 1 x 10 – 8 torr), higher cavity temperature (� 100 °F), and other accessories such as a tuner, two turbo pumps, and an E – probe damper, which {{is close to the}} actual operating condition. With maximum insertion of the tuning plunger, the resonant frequency is measured as ƒm = 351. 60 MHz. In this measurement the small ports in the cavity covers are <b>covered</b> with blank <b>flanges.</b> The measurement in case (c) is considered to be the most practical and useful in determining the right cavity dimensions for the right frequency. This information is used in estimation of the resonant frequency changes and the corresponding dimensional correction of the cavity. II...|$|R
