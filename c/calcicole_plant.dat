40|$|No Brasil são incipientes os estudos sobre os aspectos nutricionais do cultivo do nim. Propôs-se, neste trabalho, determinar os teores foliares de macronutrientes em plantios de nim estabelecidos em oito Estados do Brasil e correlacioná-los com os nutrientes disponíveis na camada de 0 - 20 cm de profundidade dos solos sob os plantios amostrados. De cada plantio foram coletadas folhas de nove árvores das partes média/superior e média/inferior da copa, as quais foram misturadas, formando duas amostras compostas denominadas folhas da copa média/superior (FCMS) e folhas da copa média/inferior (FCMI). Para análise de variância dos teores foliares de nutrientes utilizou-se o delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com decomposição total dos graus de liberdade visando ao efeito local de plantio, idade de plantio e posição na copa, sendo a comparação de médias realizada pelo Teste de Duncan (p In Brazil, {{there are}} very few studies about {{nutritional}} status of neem. This study aimed to determine the contents of macronutrients in leaf in neem plantations established in different locations in eight states of Brazil, and perform correlations with the available nutrients in the respective soils under the sampled plantation. From each plantation the leaves were collected from nine trees, from the middle superior and middle inferior part of the crown. Each part of the crown of the nine trees were mixed, forming two composite samples and were nominated as leaves from the middle superior crown (FCMS), and middle inferior crown (FCMI). At the time of leaf sampling, the soil was collected in 0 - 20 cm depth. For variance analysis of the nutrient contents of leaf, a completely randomized design was used, applying total decomposition of the degrees of freedom for stand localization, stand age and crown position effect, being the mean comparisons performed by the Duncan test (p < 0, 05). Additional correlation and cluster analysis were applied integrating soil data. The leaf sampling of neem trees, when realized {{in the middle of the}} crown subdivided in FCMS and FCMI depends, among other factors, on the nutrient mobility and on the light conditions of the stand. The leaf contents of Ca show indications that the neem plant could be a <b>calcicole</b> <b>plant,</b> and efficient in N and P absorption. The soil K content is positively correlated with the K content of the FCMI position...|$|E

30|$|Endogenous {{organic acids}} are both {{a source of}} carbon skeletons for other {{biochemical}} pathways {{as well as an}} energy source for cells in the respiratory cycle [22]. In plants, malic acid (MA) is metabolized in mitochondria, acts as a common reserve anion in the plant vacuole, and is a counter ion for K and Ca cations, especially in nitrate-dependent plants [23 – 25]. Citrate and malate extruded by roots of <b>calcicole</b> <b>plants</b> (plants growing in alkaline soils) facilitate the extraction of phosphorus and iron from such soils [26]. Citric acid (CA) alone or in combination with iron sources has been sprayed on the foliage of plants for successful recovery from iron chlorosis [27 – 30]. Use of CA alone or in combinations with salicylic acid (SA) and MA increased the essential oil production of Ocimum basilicum L. and Anethum graveolens L. [31, 32]. Foliar application of CA extended the vase life of lily (Lilium spp.) and tuberose (Polianthes tuberosa L.) while improving drought tolerance in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) [30, 33, 34]. Combination of 1  mM SA with 7  mM CA was superior to others for improving flowering and essential oil production in Ocimum basilicum L. [35]. The level of CA inside plant tissue is increased by exogenous application of CA and beneficial effects were observed, which were attributed to observed protective effects on peroxidation-linked membrane deterioration, free radical scavenging, maintenance of membrane stability, an increase in root activity, and activation of an antioxidant response [36]. The increase in peroxidase activity from CA application, which is responsible for H 2 O 2 metabolism, has been documented [37]. IBA is responsible for an H 2 O 2 increase, which promotes the formation of adventitious roots, possibly via a change in antioxidant enzymes activity; the same rooting response is reported with the addition of either ascorbic acid or H 2 O 2 [38].|$|R
40|$|Exudation {{of organic}} acids has been {{hypothesized}} to greatly improve {{the ability of}} plants to establish on nutrient poor soils such as those found in calcareous environments. An understanding of the behaviour of organic acids in these soils {{is crucial to the}} critical assessment of their potential capacity for nutrient mobilization. The aim of this study was therefore to study the sorption reactions and mineralization potentials of three organic acids commonly found in root exudates of <b>calcicole</b> <b>plants</b> (citrate, malate and oxalate). Using maize as a model plant, we studied the root exudation of organic acids into a calcareous soil and assessed the organic acid biodegradation rate in rhizosphere and bulk soil. Our results indicate that malate and citrate are rapidly biodegraded in this calcareous soil, in agreement with previous studies presented for non-calcareous soils. In contrast, oxalate appears to be resistant to microbial degradation possibly due to substrate protection by the formation and precipitation of Ca-oxalate. The rate of malate biodegradation was significantly enhanced in rhizosphere soil relative to that in bulk soil possibly reflecting the high degree of efflux of this organic acid from maize roots. The levels of free organic acids in the soil solution of calcareous soil surrounding maize roots, whilst higher than in the bulk soil, were extremely low...|$|R

40|$|One {{third of}} the earth´s soils is calcareous. Calcifuge plants are {{excluded}} from these soils, {{and one of the}} main causes is Fe deficiency, as Fe solubility in calcareous soil is very low. A lack of Fe lowers chlorophyll content, visible as yellowing of leaves, called chlorosis. It is demonstrated that the main cause of chlorosis in calcifuges is that {{a large part of the}} Fe in their leaf tissues is immobilized in a form that is not metabolically 'active', which is not the case in <b>calcicole</b> <b>plants</b> adapted to growth on such soils. The Fe fraction in leaves responsible for chlorophyll synthesis may be Fe 2 + and can be extracted by synthetical chelators. 1, 10 -phenanthroline extractable Fe correlates well with degree of chlorosis. An additional cause of chlorosis in some calcifuges is a decreased Fe uptake by the root. Phosphorus concentration in the leaf tissue does not seem to have an influence on metabolically 'active' Fe, though phosphate addition to the soil may aggravate chlorosis. Studied were also other conditions of possible importance to calcicole-calcifuge behaviour, such as differences among plants in compartmentation of Fe between shoots, roots and the soil/root interface, as well as allocation of Fe and other plants nutrients to plant seeds. Iron immobilization in the tissue is ecologically important to the calcicole-calcifuge behaviour of plants, as it might decrease vitality in calcifuges and exclude them from calcareous soil...|$|R

40|$|Calcareous {{soils are}} {{frequently}} typified by a low availability of plant nutrients due to poor solubility {{of these elements}} at high pH. <b>Calcicole</b> <b>plants</b> have recently been shown to release organic acids {{in response to the}} nutrient deficient conditions prevailing in these soils. It has been speculated, however, that the efficiency of this nutrient mobilization mechanism may be significantly reduced by microbial degradation of the organic acids. In conventional methods, root exudate degradation is typically determined by the addition of 14 C-radiolabeled substrates to soil and subsequent tracking of their fate with time by trapping evolved 14 CO 2 in a strong alkali trap. However, in calcareous soils, 14 CO 2 and H 214 CO 3 produced by microbial decomposition may become trapped as Ca(H 14 CO 3) 2. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate an experimental procedure for the accurate quantification of 14 C-labeled substrate degradation rates in calcareous soils. Conventional methods for determining 14 C-labeled substrate decomposition rates in calcareous soils are inaccurate due to incomplete recovery of 14 CO 2. Up to 49 % of the 14 CO 2 produced during microbial degradation of 14 C-labeled organic acids (malate, oxalate, citrate) was trapped as carbonate in this calcareous soil (pH 7. 58). For an acid soil (pH 4. 32) no detectable amount of 14 CO 2 was trapped. We describe a simple, accurate, and reliable method, which includes a postincubation HCl addition, for the accurate determination of 14 CO 2 -evolution and substrate degradation in calcareous soils...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the response mechanisms of grapevine to Fe-deficiency and to potential Fe chlorosis prevention strategies. The {{results show that the}} presence of bicarbonate in the nutrient solution shifted the activity of PEPC and TCA cycle enzymes and the accumulation/translocation of organic acids in roots of Fe-deprived plants. The rootstock 140 Ruggeri displayed a typical behavior of <b>calcicole</b> <b>plants</b> under bicarbonate stress. The Fe chlorosis susceptible rootstock 101 - 14 reacted to a prolonged Fe-deficiency reducing the root activity of PEPC and MDH. Noteworthy, it accumulates high levels of citric acid in roots, indicating a low capacity to utilizing, transporting and/or exudating organic acids into the rhizosfere. In contrast, 110 Richter rootstock is capable to maintain an active metabolism of organic acids in roots, accumulating them to a lesser extent than 101 - 14. Similarly to 101 - 14, SO 4 genotype displays a strong decrease of mechanisms associated to Fe chlorosis tolerance (PEPC and MDH enzymes). Nevertheless it is able to avoid excessive accumulation of citric acid in roots, similar as 110 Richter rootstock. Intercropping with Festuca rubra increased leaf chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis. In addition, intercropping reduces the activity of PEPC in roots, similary to Fe-chelate supply. Applications of NH 4 + with nitrification inhibitor prevents efficiently Fe-deficiency, increases chlorophyll content, and induces similar root biochemical responses as Fe-EDDHA. Without the addition of nitrification inhibitors, the effectiveness of NH 4 + supply on Fe chlorosis prevention resulted significantly lower. The aspects intertwined in this investigation highlight the complexity of Fe physiology and the fine metabolic tuning of grapevine genotypes to Fe availability and soil-related environmental factors. The experimental evidences reveal the need to carry out future researches on Fe nutrition maintaining a continous flow of knowledge between theoretical and agronomical perspectives for fully supporting the efforts devoted to convert science into practice...|$|R
40|$|Background {{and aims}} Natural and semi-natural, non-fertilized {{calcareous}} soils are consistently low in soluble and easily exchangeable phosphate. An over-utilization, or possibly an immobilization, of inorganic P in the tissues of calcifuge plants may take place, if such plants {{are forced to}} grow on a calcareous soil, though {{this has not been}} experimentally demonstrated. The objectives of this study are, therefore, to elucidate if calcifuge plants, when forced to develop on a calcareous soil, not only have lower total P (Ptot) concentrations in their leaves than <b>calcicole</b> <b>plants</b> grown on such soil, but also a lower proportion of Not as water-soluble, inorganic phosphate. Such differences may be of importance in understanding the calcicole-calcifuge behaviour of plants. Materials and methods <b>Plants</b> of five <b>calcicole</b> and five calcifuge herbs and three calcicole and three calcifuge grasses were cultivated in a glasshouse on a moderately acid Cambisol and a calcareous Rendzic Leptosol using seeds of wild populations from southern Sweden. The calcifuges were: Corynephorus canescens, Deschampsia flexuosa, Holcus mollis, Digitalis purpurea, Lychnis viscaria, Rumex acetosella, Scleranthus annus and Silene rupestris. The calcicoles were: Melica ciliata, Phleum phleoides, Sesleria caerulea, Arabis hirsuta, Sanguisorba minor, Scabiosa columbaria, Silene uniflora ssp. petraea and Veronica spicata. Key results At harvest, calcifuges had much lower leaf tissue concentrations of Ptot and Pi than calcicoles when grown on the calcareous soil, and biomass production of the calcifuges was poor on this soil. Moreover, the calcifuge herbs had, on average, a lower proportion of their Ptot as Pi than had the calcicole herbs. The calcifuge herbs were also unable to avoid excessive uptake of Ca from the calcareous soil. The calcifuge grasses maintained a similar proportion of Ptot as Pi as the calcicole grasses, but their growth was still poor on the calcareous soil. Conclusions On calcareous soil, very little Pi in the tissues of calcifuge herbs is, at any time, available for use in various physiological functions. This is of importance to their photosynthesis, growth, competition and final survival on such soils...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} of sampling the leafhopper assemblages on a field experiment designed to examine the differential effects of rabbits and livestock (mainly sheep) on the vegetation of chalk heath in southern England. Experimental plots that excluded livestock either allowed entry by rabbits or excluded them. Results were compared with those from plots grazed by both livestock and rabbits. After 7 years, exclusion of grazing herbivores had resulted in predictable increases in vegetation height, but no major changes were detected in the species composition of the vegetation. As expected, ungrazed plots had higher species richness and greater abundances of several individual leafhopper species. However, plots grazed only by rabbits had a leafhopper assemblage that was distinct from either ungrazed or mixed grazing plots. It is suggested that rabbit grazing may have subtle effects on grassland invertebrate assemblages that are not necessarily predictable from {{an examination of the}} species composition of the vegetation. Chalk heath vegetation contains an unusual mixture of <b>calcicole</b> and calcifuge <b>plant</b> species, but the leafhopper assemblage included a restricted number of calcareous grassland specialist species and only one species strongly associated with acidic grasslands; most leafhoppers recorded were generalist grassland species...|$|R
