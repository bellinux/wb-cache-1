60|$|At {{the end of}} March {{the opium}} jars arrive at the stores by water and by land, and {{continue}} accumulating for some weeks. Every jar is labelled and stowed in a proper place, separately tested with extreme accuracy, and valued. When the whole quantity has been received, the contents of all the jars are thrown into great vats, occupying a very large building, whence the mass is distributed, to be made up into balls for the markets. This operation is carried on in a long paved room, where every man is ticketed, and many overseers are stationed {{to see that the}} work is properly conducted. Each workman sits on a stool, with a double stage and a tray before him. On the top stage is a tin basin, containing opium sufficient for three balls; in the lower another basin, holding water: in the tray stands a brass hemispherical cup, in which the ball is worked. To the man's right hand is another tray, with two compartments, one containing thin pancakes of poppy petals pressed together, the other a cupful of sticky opium-water, made from refuse opium. The man takes the brass cup, and places a pancake at the bottom, smears it with opium-water, and with many plies of the pancakes makes a coat for the opium. Of this he takes about one-third of the mass before him, puts it inside the petals, and agglutinates many other coats over it: the balls are then again weighed, and reduced or increased to a certain weight if necessary. At the day's end, each man takes his work to a rack with numbered compartments, and deposits it in that which answers to his own number, thence the balls (each being put in a <b>clay</b> <b>cup)</b> are carried to an enormous drying-room, where they are exposed in tiers, and constantly examined and turned, to prevent their being attacked by weevils, which are very prevalent during moist winds, little boys creeping along the racks all day long for this purpose. When dry, the balls are packed in two layers of six each in chests, with the stalks, dried leaves, and capsules of the plant, and sent down to Calcutta. A little opium is prepared of very fine quality for the Government Hospitals, and some for general sale in India; but the proportion is trifling, and such is made up into square cakes. A good workman will prepare from thirty to fifty balls a day, the total produce being 10,000 to 12,000 a day; during one working season 1,353,000 balls are manufactured for the Chinese market alone.|$|E

In essence, the recipe of the original sangrita is thought to be that and the same recipe of the fruit salad from which it was strained.

5000|$|In 1890, James Scotford of Edmore, Michigan, {{claimed that}} he had found a number of artifacts, {{including}} a <b>clay</b> <b>cup</b> with strange symbols and carved tablets, with symbols that looked vaguely hieroglyphic. He put them forward as evidence that people from the Near East or Europe had lived in America. The find attracted interest and also eager looters who arrived to look for more artifacts. It was reported in the Detroit News that Scotford was involved in the forgeries sold at the railroad tracks, ranging from the first to third series of forgeries. Scotford was a sign-painter by trade who used to live in Montcalm County. (Young, 1) He and his company [...] "would dig until they located an artifact, and then the dignitaries who sponsored the work were invited to remove that artifact". (Stamps, 213) Originally, Scotford found his way to Detroit with intentions of selling copper. Detroit was the place to be, with its booming economy and availability of raw materials necessary to produce more artifacts. Ironically, it was Scotford's name that appeared on the certificate of discovery for the second batch of frauds in the museum at the University of Michigan. The relics, however, may have been marked as [...] "discovered by William H.Scotford," [...] an alias.|$|E
50|$|One {{hamlet of}} Trowulan is still called Kemasan, {{from the word}} mas, meaning 'gold'. Gold {{ornaments}} have been discovered near this area, {{as well as the}} tools that were used for working the gold. Small <b>clay</b> <b>cups</b> might have been used for melting gold for use in lost wax casting. Bronze anvils and flat circular stones with three legs may have been used as work surfaces for chiselling and hammering metals. A large number of clay crucibles for melting bronze have been excavated at Pakis village, {{in the southern part of}} the site. Some of the bronze was used to cast uang gobog, large coins or amulets, in stone moulds. Other metal objects include ornate bronze lamps, water containers, bells and other items probably used in religious ceremonies, and instruments usually called 'slit drums'. Similar objects made of wood or bamboo are still found in Javanese and Balinese villages. Many iron tools were used, but most were probably imported, as Java has little iron ore.|$|R
40|$|When I create art it is {{as though}} I am {{building}} a metaphorical cathedral. Although there is serenity and faith within the process, there simultaneously exists an equal measure of frustration and mystery in the final outcome. At times I am like an ancient Chinese monk who, scrambling to please a merciless emperor, stumbles at last upon his pet cricket’s cage and using this accidental inspiration designs the perfect plan for the Forbidden City. My art then, at its best, possesses the rigidity of ritual, the flexibility of enlightenment and the joy of invention. I believe in the power of symbolism and in its ability to deliver a clear and consistent message throughout the ages. This concept has driven me to create a pastoral robe fashioned from men’s ties, a Lenten calendar derived from ancient Christian symbols, as well as a collection of <b>clay</b> <b>cups</b> paired with linoleum block prints in memory of a Finnish love affair.

40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} and electron diffraction {{studies have}} been carried out on cupric ferrocyanide gels, chosen as a prototype of an inorganic semi-permeable membrane. It was believed that a study of the structure and morphology of such membranes, which are seemingly less complicated than the important organic semi-permeable membranes surrounding all living cells, will throw light on the little understood phenomenon of semi-permeability. It has been found that cupric ferrocyanide gels consist of loosely and randomly packed primary particles in the size range of 10 to 30 A. The pore space is the interstices between the particles. The primary particles are crystalline, the electron and x-ray diffraction patterns corresponding to the standard pattern of Cu 2 Fe(CN) 6. However, samples prepared and washed very rapidly exhibit more disorder, and consist of extremely small and imperfect crystals, or may be essentially amorphous, in the sense that liquid type diffraction patterns are observed. Aging under moderate conditions results in an increase in crystal size to the range of 30 to 200 A. This observation may explain why many earlier investigators aged and washed for a long time the practical cupric ferrocyanide membranes deposited in the pore space of a parchment thimble or porous <b>clay</b> <b>cup,</b> inasmuch as the film or membrane composed of large crystals may be stronger, and thus serves as a better semi-permeable membrane. In view of the small primary particle size and the small size of the interstices, it is concluded that among the classical theories of semi-permeability, the adsorption theory is predominant, but that solution and size effects play an important role...|$|E
40|$|Accidental {{discoveries of}} {{artifacts}} – a clay pegged cup decorated with cord impressions and a stone hatchet of the Corded Ware culture at site 23 in Czelin (Mieszkowice commune, west-Pomeranian voivodeship), previously published, a damaged multi-burial grave of the TRB culture (g. 1), became {{the groundwork for}} the recapitulation of problems connected with the grave goods from the late Neolithic and the start of the Bronze Age on the lower Oder. In connection with the lack of evidence of these unknown sources, the authors attempt to ascertain a link with the damaged grave – the only recognized feature of the Corded Ware culture from the site at Czelin. Examples from late Neolithic and early Bronze age sepulchral discoveries {{in the area of the}} lower Oder, show that problems similar to those from Czelin also occurred, concerning the lack of evidence for funerary rituals. In Czelin a small part of a grave pit survived, from which the incomplete remains of three burials were excavated: of a maturus female (40 – 45 years old), for whom an incomplete genetic prole has been made, an infans II child and an adult. The grave in situ contained only a clay vessel – an S-shaped pegged cup, decorated with cord impressions (g. 2). A radiocarbon date was obtained from the female skeleton – 3785 ± 35 BP (calibration: 1 ä 2290 BC (47. 1 %) 2190 BC; 2 ä 2340 BC (91. 5 %) 2120 BC), which conrmed a great convergence of the chronology of the grave from Czelin with a multi-burial grave from Dêbogóra (Widuchowa commune, West Pomeranian voivodeship), noted on the grounds of the similarity of cups discovered in both sepulchral features. These discoveries may be placed in stage 3 a of the Corded Ware culture of the lower Oder group of this culture’s period, which is identied with a horizon of regional differentiation of cultural inventories and input of local corded societies into a sphere of contacts with proto- and early Bronze Age societies. A similar chronological position may be accorded to a cup discovered at site 23 in Czelin in unknown circumstances (g. 3). It shows a strong typological similarity with the cup discovered in the grave but differs in its size (g. 5). There is less data concerning the stone hatchet, which disappeared and is known only from a photo (g. 4). Only generally it may be connected with younger or degenerated types of series K, possibly hatchets of the Wkra type that begin to appear in graves in stage 2 of the Corded Ware culture. In all known burials connected with the Corded Ware culture in the Oder estuary the presence of grave gifts was stated. Most frequently pottery occurred (table 1) in the form of 1 – 2 vessels although other specimens were deposited (6 – 7 items). The second frequent group of artifacts includes stone hatchets (from 1 to 4 types in a grave), most often of the Wkra type or hatchets of type K. The last numerously represented category comprises int axes. Slightly rarer are int arrowheads, flint daggers, as well as other stone products (axes, grinders, fragments of a stone quern) and int ones (blades, chisels, a sickle). In just four graves amber constituted part of the gifts. Moreover, in one case a bone blade and a clay whorl were recorded. The present state of knowledge considerably limits our understanding about correlation between the dead sex and types of burial gifts, which is often undertaken in different regions. In collective burials no clear growth in the number of grave goods was observed. The most interesting case, in comparison with Czelin, was a grave from Dêbogórza, where each of the individuals was buried with one vessel. Within the whole Corded Ware culture circle there is no uniform practice concerning the number and character of burial gifts deposited in graves. Most often such artifacts as stone hatchets, axes, chisels or stone knives are associated with male graves, whereas among females, ornaments (mostly made of amber) and pottery vessels are mentioned. Children may have had no accompanying goods or could be equipped with pottery, hatchets, and sometimes miniaturized artifacts, including vessels. Looking at the collected information it seems that a connection of incidental nds of the <b>clay</b> <b>cup</b> and stone hatchet, which was discovered at the Czelin multi-burial grave cannot be excluded...|$|E

The text reads as : (Side 1) 2 ̆ 2 The naval stores {{industry}} was important to maritime power worldwide. Pine tar and pitch were used to seal wooden ships and protect sails and rigging. When settlers came to America - in Florida (1565), in Virginia (1607) and in Massachusetts (1620) - they found vast pine forests with resinous tar and pitch, a scarce commodity for European competitors with wooden fleets. Settlers at first produced pine pitch and tar by distilling resin-soaked fat pine wood from dead tree logs, limbs and knots, covering them with soil and burning them to yield tar and charcoal. After fat pine wood became scarce, pitch was made by chopping deep cavities or boxes near the base of living trees to collect gum. Only crude gum was exported until simple distillation techniques separated volatile turpentine from the residual rosin poured hot into barrels for domestic use or export. During the next three hundred years, with little change, this forest product industry prospered, first in the Carolinas, then Georgia and Florida to become a major U. S. industry.

5000|$|At the beginning, many {{scholars}} propose the restitution [...] "I am...". The {{second and third}} lines form a hexameter verse each, with a perfect regular scansion. Modern scholars agree that the text is meant as a humorous contrast between {{the richness of the}} legendary Cup of Nestor and the simplicity of the <b>clay</b> drinking <b>cup.</b> There are several interpretations, some of which make use of textual emendations, to explain the humorous effect of the perceived incoherence between the first line and the others. One emendation is that the beginning should read: [...] "" [...] ('Nestor's cup may be good, but...'), or [...] "" [...] ('Nestor's cup, begone!'). A third hypothesis is that the text {{was the result of a}} [...] "drinking-party game": One player wrote the first line, then a second player was challenged to complement the poem with a second line, and so on. This is reinforced by the phrasing of the last verse, which says, albeit very elegantly, that the drinker will become sexually aroused.

50|$|By contrast, the Yixing <b>clay</b> teapots and <b>cups</b> {{made from}} Yixing clay from Jiangsu {{province}} are usually left unglazed, and not washed after use, as the clay {{is believed to}} improve {{the taste of the}} tea, especially after it acquires a patina from long use. There are in fact a number of different clays, giving a range of colours. The pots are unusual in that they are often signed by their potters, which is very rare in China, perhaps because they were associated with the literati culture, of which Jiangsu was a stronghold. The earliest datable example is from a burial of 1533 in Nanjing. Elaborately decorated examples, often with a rectangular body, were exported to Europe from the 18th century, and these and pots for local use often had poems inscribed on them. As well as teaware and desk objects such as brush-rests, fruit and other natural shapes were modelled as ornaments. Production continues today, generally using simpler shapes.|$|R
