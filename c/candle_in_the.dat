5|$|It {{has been}} {{said to be the}} largest non-wax Christmas <b>candle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. Although {{conceived}} with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations, city officials also believed a candle would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some have criticized the Peace Candle, calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a <b>candle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for the night shift on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} non-working air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, but it always ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case. Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) brings in Hill, who {{turns out to be a}} 12-year-old boy (Kenny Blank), much to the amusement of the other detectives.|$|E
25|$|The single <b>candle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left-front {{holder of}} the ornate six-branched {{chandelier}} is possibly the candle used in traditional Flemish marriage customs. Lit in full daylight, like the sanctuary lamp in a church, the candle may allude {{to the presence}} of the Holy Ghost or the ever-present eye of God. Alternatively, Margaret Koster posits that the painting is a memorial portrait, as the single lit candle on Giovanni's side contrasts with the burnt-out candle whose wax stub can just be seen on his wife's side, evoking a common literary metaphor: he lives on, she is dead.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday, November 24, 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy {{requested}} {{an eternal}} flame for her husband's grave. According to several published accounts, she {{drew inspiration from}} a number of sources. One was the eternal flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, which {{she and her husband had}} seen during a visit to France in 1961. She also took inspiration from the novel The <b>Candle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wind (the fourth book from the collection The Once and Future King by T. H. White), which was part of the inspiration for the 1960 stage musical Camelot (the cast recording was a favorite of the Kennedys). Her brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, counseled against an eternal flame, worried that it might appear ostentatious or that it would compete with other such memorials at Arlington National Cemetery. But Mrs. Kennedy was adamant.|$|E

500|$|The Peace Candle is {{believed}} to be the largest non-wax Christmas <b>candle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Since it was first erected in 1951, Easton city officials have at various times declared it the largest <b>candle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. In 1972, city council president Henry Schultz declared, [...] "We claim, and no one has ever argued with us, that this is the largest <b>candle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world." [...] However, the Schlitz Christmas Candle, a non-wax candle-like structure in Schlitz, a small town in Hesse, Germany, is larger at [...] tall. The current Peace Candle is taller than the Guinness World Record-holder for tallest candle, which belongs to an [...] tall, [...] wide candle exhibited at the General Art and Industrial Exhibition of Stockholm in 1897. However, only wax candles are eligible for the record, and there is no Guinness World Record for largest non-wax candle. When the third incarnation of the Peace Candle was built in 1990, Easton officials tried unsuccessful to seek a Guinness record for it.|$|E

500|$|The verse {{may be one}} of few English nursery rhymes to have ancient origins.

A worker named Mallory was lowered into the shaft by rope the next day; he was overcome by fumes and reported no survivors, and no further rescue attempts were made. Several months later, workers reached the shaft's bottom and found that several victims had survived long enough to fashion a raft before suffocating.|$|E

By 2003 allegations of ritual abuse were met with great skepticism and belief in SRA was no longer considered mainstream in professional circles; although the sexual abuse of children is a real and serious problem, allegations of SRA were essentially false. Reasons for the collapse of the phenomenon include the collapse of criminal prosecution against alleged abusers, a growing number of scholars, officials and reporters questioning the reality of the accusations, and a variety of successful lawsuits against mental health professionals.
