These antennas are aimed to work in conjunction with quantum dot semiconductor lasers to effectively generate pulsed and CW terahertz radiation. For the efficient operation, laser wavelengths providing the highest photocurrent should be determined. To study the interband photoconductivity of quantum dot photoconductive antennas, at room and cryogenic temperatures, we employed a broadly-tunable InAs/GaAs quantum dot based laser providing a coherent pump with power exceeding 20 mW over a 100 nm tunability range. The quantum dot antenna structure revealed sharp temperature-dependent photoconductivity peaks in the vicinity of wavelengths, corresponding to the ground and excited states of InAs/GaAs quantum dots.

40|$|Hot charge <b>carrier</b> <b>extraction</b> from {{metallic}} nanostructures is a {{very promising}} approach for applications in photo-catalysis, photovoltaics and photodetection. One limitation is that many metallic nanostructures support a single plasmon resonance thus restricting the light-to-charge-carrier activity to a spectral band. Here we demonstrate that a monolayer of plasmonic nanoparticles can be assembled on a multi-stack layered configuration to achieve broad-band, near-unit light absorption, which is spatially localised on the nanoparticle layer. We show that this enhanced light absorbance leads to ∼ 40 -fold increases in the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency by the plasmonic nanostructures. We developed a model that successfully captures the essential physics of the plasmonic hot-electron charge generation and separation in these structures.

40|$|Carrier {{selective}} (CS) silicon {{solar cells}} are increasingly explored {{using a variety}} of different materials. However, the optimum properties of such CS materials are not well understood. In this context, through detailed analytical and numerical modeling, here we provide several interesting insights on the efficiency tradeoff with CS material properties. First, we show that perfect band alignment is a desirable feature only if the interface is devoid of any trap states. Otherwise, a band offset of around 0. 2 eV- 0. 4 eV provides sufficient band bending to reduce the effect of interface recombination, thus improving the performance. Surprisingly, the interface passivation quality for the minority <b>carrier</b> <b>extraction</b> layer is found to be far less demanding than that for the majority <b>carrier</b> <b>extraction</b> layer. Additionally, doping density and dielectric constant of CS layers have a similar effect as band offset on solar cell performance.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the performance of 10 -layer stacked GaSb/GaAs quantum dot (QD) and quantum ring (QR) solar cells (SCs) having a type-II band alignment. For both SCs, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) increased in the longer wavelength region beyond GaAs bandedge wavelength of λ > 870 nm due to an additive contribution from GaSb/GaAs QD or QR layers inserted in the intrinsic region of p-i-n SC structure. The EQE of GaSb/GaAs QRSC was {{higher than that of}} QDSC at room temperature and the photoluminescence intensity from GaSb/GaAs QRs was stronger compared with GaSb/GaAs QDs.

Currently, the certified power conversion efficiency of CQDPV has reached 9. 2 %. Compared to the 31 % theoretical efficiency limit of single junction solar cells, device performances have still have a large potential to be improved. For photovoltaic devices, a classical way to enhance absorption is to increase the thickness of the active layers. Although this approach can improve absorption, it reduces the charge <b>carriers</b> <b>extraction</b> efficiency. Photo-generated <b>carriers,</b> in fact, are prone to recombine within the defects inside CQD active layers. In an effort to solve this problem, we proposed to increase light absorption from a given thickness of colloidal quantum dot layers with the assistance of disorder. Our approach is to develop new types of electrodes with multi-scale disordered features, which localize energy into the active layer through plasmonic effects. We fabricated nanostructured gold substrates by electrochemical methods, which allow to control surface disorder as a function of deposition conditions. We demonstrated that the light absorption from 600 nm to 800 nm is impressively enhanced, when the disorder of the nanostructured surface increases. Compared to the planar case, the most disorder case increased 65 % light absorption at the wavelength of λ = 700 nm in the 100 nm PbS film.
