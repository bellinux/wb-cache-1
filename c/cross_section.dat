5|$|The {{nuclear fission}} {{properties}} of berkelium {{are different from}} those of the neighboring actinides curium and californium, and they suggest berkelium to perform poorly as a fuel in a nuclear reactor. Specifically, berkelium-249 has a moderately large neutron capture <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> of 710 barns for thermal neutrons, 1200 barns resonance integral, but very low fission <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> for thermal neutrons. In a thermal reactor, much of it will therefore be converted to berkelium-250 which quickly decays to californium-250. In principle, berkelium-249 can sustain a nuclear chain reaction in a fast breeder reactor.

25|$|Another line of {{research}} at Liverpool was measuring the fission <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> of uranium-235, on which Frisch and Peierls' calculations depended.

Data published by the Americans in the 15 March and 15 April 1940 issues of Physical Review indicated that the fission <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> was much smaller.
