50|$|Awnings became common {{during the}} first half of the 19th century. At that time they {{consisted}} of timber or cast iron posts set along the sidewalk edge and linked by a front <b>cross</b> <b>bar.</b> To lend <b>support</b> to larger installations, angled rafters linked the front <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> to the building facade. The upper end of the canvas was connected to the facade with nails, with grommets and hooks, or by lacing the canvas to a head rod bolted to the facade. The other (projecting) end of the canvas was draped over or laced to a front bar with the edge often hanging down to form a valance. On ornate examples, metal posts were adorned with filigree and the tops decorated with spear ends, balls or other embellishments. On overcast days or when rain did not threaten, the covering was often rolled up against the building facade; during the winter months proper maintenance called for the removal and storage of awnings. Photographs from the mid-19th century often show the bare framework, suggesting that the covering was extended only when necessary. Canvas duck was the predominant awning fabric, a strong, closely woven cotton cloth used for centuries to make tents and sails.|$|R
40|$|Pressure locked {{gratings}} {{have many}} uses, both {{on land and}} at sea. This is mainly due to {{the high degree of}} flexibility in dimensions and load bearing capacity. Despite the many uses in our surroundings, the term pressure locked grating is unknown to many. This term refers {{to the way in which}} the most important connection in pressure locked gratings is manufactured. Pressure locked gratings are galvanized and/or coated to prevent corrosion, galvanization is almost always used. This thesis is primarily focused on the behavior of galvanized pressure locked gratings. A pressure locked grating is made up of three type of bars: load bearing <b>bars,</b> <b>cross</b> <b>bars</b> and <b>support</b> <b>bars.</b> The connections between the load bearing <b>bars</b> and the <b>cross</b> <b>bars</b> are realized by pressing the <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> into premade notch in the load bearing bar. The bars will deform plastically, which results in a connection based only on friction. This connection is called a pressure locked connection. The load bearing bars serve primarily for load transfer in one direction. The pressure locked connection weakens the load bearing <b>bars.</b> The <b>cross</b> <b>bars</b> redistribute a local load over the load bearing bars outside of the loading area and reduce the buckling length of the individual load bearing <b>bar.</b> The <b>support</b> <b>bars</b> are spot-welded to both the load bearing and <b>cross</b> <b>bars.</b> Pressure locked gratings are calculated according to RAL-GZ- 638, a standard published by the Deutsches Institut für Gütesicherung und Kennzeichnung e. V. In this standard, pressure locked gratings are calculated on the basis of linear elasticity theory. A calculation according to the EN 1993 - 1 - 1 is not possible because it is not suited for pressure locked gratings. The main objective of this thesis is to determine if a calculation based on the plasticity theory is possible for pressure locked gratings. Through the application of this theory the design strength can be greatly increased, which has a large economic potential. This research is divided up into four parts that are stated below. 9 ̆ 5 Analytical study 9 ̆ 5 Experimental study 9 ̆ 5 FEM validation 9 ̆ 5 Parametric study The vast diversity in size and properties and the complex functioning of the pressure locked connection make pressure locked gratings a difficult product to research. The pressure locked connection also has a big influence on the strength and stiffness. In this galvanizing has a big influence. The analytical study shows that pressure locked gratings fail through: local lateral torsional buckling of one of the load bearing bars, global lateral torsional buckling for the entire pressure locked grating or by a mechanism due to a plastic hinge in de load bearing bars. To research the behavior, numerical models were developed in the FEM-package ABAQUS. To determine the accuracy of these models, experiments were carried out on a number of pressure locked grating geometries. The results of the tests were compared with FEM simulations which made it possible to validate the FEM-models. The validation has taken place on the basis of four test series. Three test series focused on failure mechanisms, namely: collapse due to a mechanism as a result of plastic hinges in the load bearing bars, test series 1 A, collapse due to local lateral torsional buckling, test series 2 A and collapse due to global lateral torsional buckling of the entire pressure locked grating, test series 2 B. The last test series, test series 1 B, is aimed at examining the structural behavior of a common used pressure locked grating. After this validation it is possible to make FEM-models for a large number of different geometries. The behavior of these geometries can then be analyzed. The validation shows that failure mode and failure load are correctly determined by the FEM models. There is however a notable difference between the stiffness of the FEM-model and the stiffness of the test specimens. This difference is likely the result of the influence of the pressure locked connection between the load bearing and <b>cross</b> <b>bars.</b> The research shows that all aforementioned failure modes play a role depending on the dimensions of load bearing <b>bars</b> and <b>cross</b> <b>bars.</b> For relatively thick-set load bearing bars pressure locked gratings fail due to a mechanism as the result of plastic hinges in the load bearing bars. For slender load bearing bars pressure locked gratings fail as a result of instabilities. With the aid of FEM models, it is possible to estimate the extent in which the plastic capacity is present in actually produced pressure locked gratings. This analysis shows that in 72...|$|R

The {{study was conducted with}} a sample made 9 pieces, which are made with 30 MPa compressive strength with specimen made of 3 pieces with <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> spacing 60 mm, 80 mm and 100 mm column with dimensions of 12. 5 x 12. 5 x 100 cm. From the analysis in this study were obtained Percentage increase in axial load compressive strength of 30 MPa to obtain a percentage increase of 23. 13 % for the <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> spacing of 60 mm, 18. 21 % for a distance of 80 mm stirrups and stirrup 13. 28 % for a distance of 100 mm. Test results show the column has a compressive strength of 30 MPa axial strain 0. 0026 - 0. 003. So the closer the <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> spacing, the greater the value of the stretch. Model of failure that often occurs in columns with 30 MPa compressive strength plan is material failure, is due to the strong influence of the <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> restraints that reduce the possibility of buckling.

50|$|A {{traction}} current pylon is a railroad pylon carrying {{at least one}} circuit for {{traction current}}. In Germany, traction current lines with two systems (4 conductor cables) typically have a single level arrangement of the conductor cables. For traction current lines with four systems (8 conductor cables), the two-level arrangement (4 conductor cables on each crossbar) is frequently used, except for traction current lines supplying high-speed railway lines are used. For these lines a three-level arrangement is used, in which the lowest <b>cross</b> <b>bar</b> has four conductor cables {{and each of the}} two highest <b>cross</b> <b>bars</b> have two conductor cables. The three-level arrangement is also used for traction current pylons with 6 electric circuits (12 conductor cables).
