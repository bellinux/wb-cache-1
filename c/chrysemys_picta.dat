2500|$|In {{some areas}} {{tortoises}} {{are more important}} in the diet than snakes, and they displace mammals and birds as the most important prey group in most of Southeastern Europe as well as the Caucasus. Hermann's tortoises (Testudo hermanni) and Greek tortoises (Testudo graeca) made up 55.4% of the prey in two nests in Bulgaria and 52.9% of the prey in 19 nests in the Republic of Macedonia. The same species are also prevalent in the diet of eagles from Greece, but no quantitative analysis is known from that country. Russian tortoises (Agrionemys horsfieldii) made up 31.9% of the prey in 5 nests in Turkmenistan and 25.4% of the prey in 36 nests in Kazakhstan. When hunting tortoise, golden eagles use a unique technique: they pick up the tortoise and fly up to at least [...] above the rocky ground, then drop the tortoise onto the terrain below in the hope of smashing open its hard shell. The only other bird species confirmed to hunt vertebrates in this way is the lammergeier (Gypaetus barbatus), although gulls may use a similar technique on hard-shelled prey such as mussels. The larger desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) of North America has occasionally turned up as prey there. Other turtles have been reported as being hunted, such as painted turtles (<b>Chrysemys</b> <b>picta)</b> in Washington state and baby loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in Corsica, but essentially are a negligible part of the diet.|$|E

50|$|When {{injured or}} damaged, the shell has the {{capacity}} to regenerate and reform. Granular tissue slowly forms and keratin slowly grows underneath the damaged area to replace damaged and missing scutes. Over time, the damaged area falls off, revealing the new keratin formed beneath it. Unlike water turtles such as the native eastern painted turtle (<b>Chrysemys</b> <b>picta),</b> box turtle scutes continue to grow throughout the turtle's life and develop growth rings. Water turtles typically shed their scutes as they grow.|$|E

50|$|The {{painted turtle}} (<b>Chrysemys</b> <b>picta)</b> uses the {{mechanism}} of metabolic depression to combat oxygen depletion. Within {{a few minutes of}} anoxia onset in the turtle's brain there is decreased cerebral blood flow that eventually ceases. Meanwhile, glycolysis is stimulated to maintain a near optimum ATP production. This compensatory stimulation of glycolysis occurs because, in the turtle's brain, cytochrome a and a3 have a low affinity for oxygen. Anaerobic glycolysis leads to lactate overload, which the turtle buffers to some extent by increased shell and bone CaCO3 production.|$|E
50|$|Inventories carried at Mont Yamaska {{allowed to}} observe over fifteen species of {{amphibians}} and even reptiles (such as the painted turtle (<b>Chrysemys</b> <b>picta)</b> and Common Garter Snake (Thamnophis sirtalis)). Common amphibians inventoried {{in the river}} are the dusky salamander (Desmognathus fucus), wood frog (Rana sylvatica), and the green frog (Rana clamitans). The Baie Lavalilière (Sainte-Anne-de-Sorel, Québec), located {{near the mouth of}} the river, is considered a very rich habitat for amphibians, although poaching of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and green frog limit their population.|$|E
50|$|Freeze tolerance, {{in which}} organisms survive the winter by {{freezing}} solid and ceasing life functions, {{is known in}} a few vertebrates: five species of frogs (Rana sylvatica, Pseudacris triseriata, Hyla crucifer, Hyla versicolor, Hyla chrysoscelis), one of salamanders (Hynobius keyserlingi), one of snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) and three of turtles (<b>Chrysemys</b> <b>picta,</b> Terrapene carolina, Terrapene ornata). Snapping turtles Chelydra serpentina and wall lizards Podarcis muralis also survive nominal freezing {{but it has not}} been established to be adaptive for overwintering. In the case of Rana sylvatica one cryopreservant is ordinary glucose, which increases in concentration by approximately 19 mmol/l when the frogs are cooled slowly.|$|E
50|$|Knowledge of {{reproductive}} behavior ranges {{from some of}} the most detailed, long-term study of any taxon (<b>Chrysemys</b> <b>picta</b> in Michigan) to a total lack of information. In many species, dimorphisms include elongated foreclaws or a concave plastron in the male. The longer claws are used in a courtship routine in which the male faces the female and fans her face. The concave plastron allows the male to mount females in species with more domed carapaces (e.g., Terrapene). Reproduction is on an annual cycle, and multiple clutches may be produced in a single season. Clutch size is quite variable, ranging from as few as two to more than 30 eggs.|$|E
50|$|The chicken turtle {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the eastern painted turtle (<b>Chrysemys</b> <b>picta</b> picta), but has an unusually long, striped neck that {{is close to the}} length of its shell, with a yellow stripe on both the forelegs and rear legs. It has webbed feet to help it swim. It has a distinguishable net-like pattern on its carapace. The carapace is pear-shaped, and is an olive to dark brown. Females are usually larger than the males, and males have a longer, thicker tail. Males also have longer front claws. At birth, chicken turtles are one inch in diameter, and adults reach from 10.2-25.4 cm. The chicken turtle is medium in size compared to other turtles.|$|E
50|$|Spencer and Janzen (2014) found {{further support}} for the Charnov-Bull model by {{incubating}} painted turtles (<b>Chrysemys</b> <b>picta)</b> at different temperatures and measuring various characteristics indicative of fitness. The turtles were incubated at temperatures that produce solely males, both sexes, and solely females. Spencer and Janzen (2014) found that hatchlings from mixed-sex nests were less energy efficient and grew less than their same-sex counterparts incubated in single-sex producing temperatures. Hatchlings from single-sex producing temperatures also had higher first-year survivorship than the hatchlings from the temperature that produces both sexes. TSD may be advantageous and selected for in turtles, as embryo energy efficiency and hatchling size are optimized for each sex at single-sex incubation temperatures and are indicative of first-year survivorship. This suggests that natural selection would favor TSD, as TSD may enhance the fitness of offspring.|$|E

Common shrubs in the forest understory include beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), saskatoon berry (Amelanchier alnifolia), nannyberry (Viburnum lentago), dogwood (Cornus sericea), highbush cranberry (Viburnum trilobum) and pincherry (Prunus pensylvanica). The area near Mary Lake includes the spotted coralroot orchid (Corallorhiza maculata) and calypso orchid (Calypso bulbosa). Turtle Mountain is home to moose (Alces alces), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), beaver (Castor canadensis), raccoon (Procyon lotor) and mink (Neovison vison), as well as birds like loons (Gavia species), great blue heron (Ardea herodias herodias), black-crowned night heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), the double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) and red-necked grebes (Podiceps grisegena).

5000|$|Storey {{is one of}} {{the most}} cited {{researchers}} in the world. Storey's research includes studies of enzyme properties, gene expression, protein phosphorylation, and cellular signal transduction mechanisms to seek out the basic principles of how organisms endure and flourish under extreme conditions. He is particularly known within the field of cryobiology for his studies of animals that can survive freezing, especially the frozen [...] "frog-sicles" [...] (Rana sylvatica) that have made his work popular with multiple TV shows and magazines. Storey's studies of the adaptations that allow frogs, insects, and other animals to survive freezing have made major advances in the understanding of how cells, tissues and organs can endure freezing. Storey was also responsible for the discovery that some turtle species are freeze tolerant: newly hatched painted turtles that spend their first winter on land (<b>Chrysemys</b> <b>picta</b> marginata & C. p. bellii). These turtles are unique as they are the only reptiles, and highest vertebrate life form, known to tolerate prolonged natural freezing of extracellular body fluids during winter hibernation. These advances may aid the development of organ cryopreservation technology. [...] A second area of his research is metabolic rate depression - understanding the mechanisms by which some animals can sharply reduce their metabolism and enter a state of hypometabolism or torpor that allows them to survive over the long term under difficult environmental stresses. His studies have identified molecular mechanisms that underlie metabolic arrest across phylogeny and that support phenomena including mammalian hibernation, estivation, and anoxia and ischemia tolerance. Control mechanisms include transcription factor changes that alter gene expression, and reversible phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. These studies across multiple species also hold key applications for medical science, particularly for preservation technologies that aim to extend the survival time of excised organs in cold or frozen storage. Additional applications include insights into hyperglycemia in metabolic syndrome and diabetes, and anoxic and ischemic damage caused by heart attack and stroke.|$|E
