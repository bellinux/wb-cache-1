For example, in conjunction with the minimization of the Dirichlet energy, it was shown to produce a compactly supported quasi-harmonic orthonormal basis, dubbed as <b>compressed</b> manifold <b>modes.</b> The continuous L 1 norm on the manifold is often replaced by the vector l 1 norm applied to sampled functions.

Third, based on the consistency maintenance function, if the amount of data returned from the server side is too massive or the data to be accessed is not in the cache, the calculation time increases, which will result in an error in the lease time. Therefore, the cluster configuration will adjust the parameter time (HBase.rpc.timeout). Finally, the server-side read each time the number of remote calls (scan.caching) settings will be adjusted. Too little adjustment will reduce the access efficiency, and too much will cause the memory to be occupied to reduce the access rate.|$|E

We have designed and implemented the algorithm based on a simulation model of a 37 -cell UMTS/GSM system consisting of an island of 7 UMTS cells surrounded by 30 GSM cells. The simulation model includes mobility of all users in the system and spatial correlation of the log-normal shadow losses in the 2. 1 GHz (for UMTS) and 900 MHz (for GSM) frequency bands. The test mobile is allowed to move along the boundary of the UMTS and GSM cells and evaluated {{the performance of}} the algorithm with the handover rate {{as a function of the}} various handover thresholds in both the networks.

In {{this thesis}} the WCDMA radio network {{performance}} and the radio network performance simulations are discussed. As research results, simulation tools are developed {{that can be used}} when investigating the WCDMA radio network performance, the effects of the various parameters on the {{performance and the}} effects of the various algorithms on the performance. Another research result is performance analysis for a set of WCDMA system parameters and algorithms based on simulations. In addition, two new methods to improve WCDMA and cdma 2000 system performance have been developed. By using the developed radio network simulator, parameters and algorithms of the WCDMA system can be studied for standardization purposes. The developed tools can be used for the development of radio resource management algorithms, radio network planning tool development and as a tool for radio network optimisation. Here two kinds of simulators are considered – static and dynamic tools. Static simulators are simple computer software, which can be used to generate sufficient results in a short time. Dynamic simulators are more complex tools, which model time span, user mobility, traffic, multiple access and realistic radio resource management. In this work, the WCDMA radio network capacity has been investigated by using the developed tools. The WCDMA base station receiver can be implemented by using a so-called multi-user detection. In this work the capacity gain due to the multi-user detection has been studied. Basestation transmission can be based on orthogonal codes or the mobile station receiver can employ interference cancellation. Here the gains from the orthogonal codes and the interference cancellation were investigated. In addition, gains from soft handover were studied. Due to the linearity of the mobile stations power amplifier and selectivity of the mobile station receiver filter, the base stations or the mobile stations operating in the adjacent frequency can cause interference in the desired channel. Here the requirements for the linearity and selectivity have been studied based on static simulations. By using simulations capacity losses due to interference from having the source in the adjacent frequency has been studied. In this thesis the effect due to power control and its parameters, random access, handover algorithms and their parameters, and <b>compressed</b> <b>mode</b> have been studied by using a dynamic radio network simulator.

Both methods are in use in both the WCDMA and cdma 2000 systems. Several WCDMA system parameters have been modified or agreed in the 3 GPP project based on the research shown here. Such parameters are e. g. the linearity requirement of the mobile station power amplifier, the selectivity requirement of the mobile stations receiver filter and the minimum power requirement of the mobile station...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A CMOS {{image sensor}} {{architecture}} with built-in single-shot compressed sensing is described. The image sensor employs a conventional 4 -T pixel and per-column ΣΔ ADCs. The compressed sensing measurements are obtained via a column multiplexer that sequentially applies randomly selected pixel values to {{the input of}} each ΣΔ modulator. At the end of readout, each ADC outputs a quantized value of {{the average of the}} pixel values applied to its input. The image is recovered from the random linear measurements off-chip using numerical optimiza-tion algorithms. To demonstrate this architecture, a 256 x 256 pixel CMOS image sensor is fabricated in 0. 15 µm CIS process. The sensor can operate in <b>compressed</b> sensing <b>mode</b> with compression ratio 1 / 4, 1 / 8, or 1 / 16 at 480, 960, or 1920 fps, respectively, or in normal capture <b>mode</b> with no <b>compressed</b> sensing at a maximum frame rate of 120 fps. Measurement results demonstrate capture in <b>compressed</b> sensing <b>mode</b> at roughly the same readout noise of 351 µV and power consumption of 96. 2 mW of normal capture at 120 fps.
