With one carucate there are six slaves. There is a wood for enclosure. It is, and was worth four pounds.—This manor, with the other lands of the king's, went to Baldwin de Redvers, when he obtained the Lordship of the Island; and remained in that family until Amicia, Countess of Devon, bestowed it (temp.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{additives}} in copper plating baths for deep via filling are chloride, polyethylene glycol (PEG), a suppressor, and bis-(3 -sulfopropyl) -disulfide (SPS), an accelerant. The copper in acid plating baths is commonly provided by Cu (II) sulfate. <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> is generally present {{as well and}} it appears to influence the effectiveness of SPS. 1 - 3 In this investigation, the interactions among SPS, <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> and oxygen were studied by rotating ring-disk voltammetry. The ring electrode acted as a plating substrate, while <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> was generated at the disk by anodic dissolution of copper. Because <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> is consumed by reaction with oxygen, the experiments were carried out under air, oxygen, or argon atmospheres. When SPS {{is present in the}} solution, a sudden kinetic acceleration is observed at the ring during <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> generation at the disk. By comparing the ring deposition rate without and with <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> generation at the disk, it is found that deposition is accelerated by higher levels of <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> and SPS. The result is considered in light of the hypothesis that the true accelerant is formed by homogeneous reaction of SPS and <b>Cu</b> (<b>I).</b> It is also found that the presence of SPS strongly affects the relative production rates of Cu(II) and Cu(I) during anodic dissolution. Whereas Cu(I) makes up no more than one percent of the copper dissolved in additive-free solution, it may account for up to twenty percent of the copper dissolved in the presence of SPS. In these experiments, the independent variables in RRDE operation are the rotation speed of the electrode and the concentration of oxygen in the solution. The extent of Cu(I) -oxygen reaction is then controlled by the concentration of one reactant, oxygen, and the residence time of the Cu(I) in solution as it transits from the disk to the ring...|$|E

All the electrode processes are moderately fast with mercury the fastest but slower on platinum and carbon paste in that order. A slow chemical step precedes oxidation of <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> to Cu (II) on allectrodes in solutions of high AN content. The slow step may be partial removal of AN from the solvated <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> ion prior to electron transfer. Electrode processes are faster in chloride ions than in sulfate ion solutions. Reduction of <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> in AN−H 2 O is quite slow on glassy carbon. Adsorption of AN on platinum and carbon influences the processes. Diffusion coefficients in sulfate solutions are in the order, <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> (AN−H 2 O) >Cu (II) (AN−H 2 O) >Fe (III) (H 2 O) and 2 -hydroxy-cyanoethane (2 -HCE) strongly decreases the mobility of <b>Cu</b> (<b>I)</b> when added to H 2 O. The relevance of the measurements to hydrometallurgical processes is considered. CuSO 4 in 30 % v/v AN−H 2 O is a ‘faster’ oxidant than the common oxidant Fe 2 (SO 4) 3 in H 2 O because of the greater mobility and faster electron acceptance from a corroding surface of Cu (II).

A second generation of (PNP) <b>Cu</b> <b>I</b> 2 dimer supported by a [PNP] - ligand also has been investigated ([PNP] - = bis(2 -(diisobutylphosphino) phenyl) amide). The highly emissive (PNP) <b>Cu</b> <b>I</b> 2 is characterized by a long-lived excited state (τ &# 62; 10 μs) with an unusually high quantum yield (φ &# 62; 0. 65) at ambient temperature.

With a highly reducing excited state reduction potential (- 3. 2 V vs. Fc + /Fc) as well as the availability of two reversible redox processes, these bimetallic copper systems may be interesting candidates for photochemically driven two-electron redox transformations. Studies of Cu 2 N 2 diamond core complexes supported by the [t Bu 2 -PNP] - ligand revealed that the dicopper complex (t Bu 2 -PNP) Cu 2 can not only be oxidized by one electron to (t Bu 2 -PNP) Cu 1. 5 2][B(C 6 H 3 (CF 3) 2) 4], but also by two-electrons to (t Bu 2 -PNP) Cu 2][SbF 6] 2 ([t Bu 2 -PNP] - = bis(2 -diisobutylphoshino- 4 - t butylphenyl) amide). These Cu 2 N 2 complexes show remarkably low structural reorganization for all oxidation states as evidenced by the solid-state molecular-structures.

40|$|Structure-Function Relationships in Fast Copper Ion Conductors 　　Crystalline superionic {{conductors}} {{of copper}} iodide (CuI) and Rb 4 <b>Cu</b> 16 <b>I</b> 7 Cl 13 with cubic symmetry {{have been investigated}} using time-of-flight (TOF) neutron powder diffraction techniques at KEK Neutron Science Laboratory, Japan. The aim has been to clarify the ionic conduction mechanism in the fast copper ions conductors. Conventional Rietveld method and the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) have been used extensively to analyze the crystal structure and to visualize the nuclear density distribution of the both systems. Local structure analysis of CuI {{was carried out by}} means of the Pair Distribution Function (PDF) and the Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) to modeling the mobile copper ions disorder. For CuI system, the results suggest that the most possible conduction pathways inside the one unit cell are along directions, with local Cu-Cu correlation observed between the neighboring tetrahedral 8 c- 32 f sites and neighboring tetrahedral 32 f- 32 f sites, as represented by the split atom model in the space group Fm- 3 m. For Rb 4 <b>Cu</b> 16 <b>I</b> 7 Cl 13 system, the results reconfirm that copper ions at Cu(1) and Cu(2) sites that moving at temperature above 100 K along the pathways of －Cu(1) -Cu(2) -Cu(1) - play the important role for increasing the total conductivity in the Rb 4 <b>Cu</b> 16 <b>I</b> 7 Cl 13 system...|$|R
