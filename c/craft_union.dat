25|$|A <b>craft</b> <b>union</b> with {{critical}} skills {{may be able}} to {{shut down}} an entire industry. The disadvantage is the harsh feelings of those who may be forced out of work by such an action, yet receive none of the bargained-for benefits.|$|E
25|$|Employers find {{it easier}} to enforce one bad contract, then use that as a precedent. Employers could also show favoritism to a {{strategic}} group of workers. Employers also {{find it easier}} to outsource the struck work of a <b>craft</b> <b>union.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{leadership}} of the Knights saw the economic strength of <b>craft</b> <b>unions</b> {{as a way to}} promote economic gains for all workers. Yet the <b>craft</b> <b>unions</b> recognized that, {{at least in the short}} term, a policy of exclusion was more favorable to skilled workers.|$|R

Through their <b>craft</b> <b>unions,</b> churches, fraternal organizations, and other institutions, they created their own cultural worlds, ones that often left little room for newcomers." ...|$|R

25|$|More importantly, {{the strike}} {{launched}} {{the career of}} Dobbs, who {{played a significant role}} in the organization of over-the-road drivers throughout the Midwest. Those efforts led in turn to the transformation of the Teamsters from a <b>craft</b> <b>union,</b> made up of locals with a parochial focus on their own craft and locality, into a truly national union.|$|E
25|$|Like the General Managers Association of Chicago, the Southern Pacific Railroad (SPR) {{acknowledged}} the danger in allowing railway workers {{to form an}} industrial union. The SPR hired the Pinkerton Agency to infiltrate and destroy the UBRE. One of the Pinkerton labor spy tactics was persuading workers to quit the industrial union and instead join a <b>craft</b> <b>union.</b> The defeat of the UBRE ended the last major attempt to organize North American railway workers into an industrial union.|$|E
25|$|The defeat forced miners to re-assess their {{tactics and}} their union philosophy. Although the {{federation}} was birthed {{as the result}} of a violent struggle and had engaged in a militant action in the Cripple Creek District in which miners used gunfire and dynamite, the organization's disposition and its Preamble envisioned a future of arbitration and conciliation with employers. After the Leadville strike, WFM leaders and their followers adopted radical politics and were open to more militant policies, breaking with the conservative, <b>craft</b> <b>union</b> based American Federation of Labor in the East.|$|E
50|$|Those {{workers who}} could {{hold on to}} their skill and their control over work processes, such as carpenters, butchers and printers, {{resisted}} by forming <b>craft</b> <b>unions.</b> They not only extolled the dignity of work and the dignity of the master worker, but frequently defined themselves by what they were not: to that end, <b>craft</b> <b>unions</b> often developed rigid entrance requirements that excluded women, immigrants, African-Americans and other minority workers.|$|R
50|$|Historically the {{practice}} of union strikebreaking has been a contentious issue in the union movement, and a point of contention between adherents of different union philosophies. For example, supporters of industrial unions, which have sought to organize entire workplaces without regard to individual skills, have criticized <b>craft</b> <b>unions</b> for organizing workplaces into separate unions according to skill, a circumstance that makes union strikebreaking more common. Union strikebreaking is not, however, unique to <b>craft</b> <b>unions.</b>|$|R

25|$|Insistence on {{retaining}} its <b>craft</b> <b>union</b> identity kept it from {{establishing a}} stronger {{presence in the}} metals industries. The union was in crisis, however. The steel industry was growing quickly, and the skilled jobs in which AA members worked were disappearing. The union had to act {{in order to save}} itself. At the November 1909 AFL convention, AA president P.J. McArdle introduced a resolution, which quickly passed, calling for an organizing drive at U.S. Steel. By December, organizers were flooding plants throughout the Northeast and Midwest. But workers remained skittish after the failed 1901 strike, and the drive never got off the ground.|$|E
25|$|Other {{iron and}} steel unions had also formed in the post-Civil War period, and in 1873 merger of the largest unions was proposed. The Associated Brotherhood of Iron and Steel Heaters, Rollers, and Roughers had formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1861. This <b>craft</b> <b>union</b> {{recruited}} the skilled workers who rolled steel in railroad track mills, but soon expanded its membership to rollers throughout the {{iron and steel}} industry. Another union, the Iron and Steel Roll Hands of the United States, formed in Chicago in 1870. This union attracted anyone whom the Associated Brotherhood would not permit as a member. The Roll Hands never achieved much membership growth, which led the union to propose merger {{as a way of}} combating employer resistance to unions.|$|E
25|$|At {{its annual}} {{convention}} in San Francisco in October 1934, the AFL {{called for an}} organizing campaign in the steel industry. As early as 1926, AFL president William Green had convinced the federation's executive council to re-establish federal labor unions (FLUs) as a compromise between workers' desires to belong to an industrial union and the jurisdictional rights of existing AFL affiliates. The FLU {{had been one of}} Samuel Gompers' favorite recruiting devices. All workers in a plant were recruited into a single union. Theoretically, after organizing in an industry was complete, the FLUs would be broken up and the workers parceled out to the appropriate <b>craft</b> <b>union.</b> Although a number of AFL affiliates protested the use of FLUs, Green put them off — declaring that the FLUs were but temporary organizing devices.|$|E

OPZZ was established in 1984 and consists of 90 <b>craft</b> <b>unions</b> grouped in 9 sector committees and of 16 regional boards in voivodeships. Since May 2004 its leader is Jan Guz.

2500|$|A {{number of}} {{employers}} tried {{to destroy the}} <b>craft</b> <b>unions</b> {{that made up the}} AFL {{in the first decade of}} the twentieth century by insisting on maintaining an [...] "open shop", i.e. hiring without reference to <b>union</b> membership. For <b>craft</b> <b>unions,</b> such as the Iron Workers, who maintained union wages and working conditions by controlling the supply of labor, the open shop meant that the employer was free to set any wage standards it chose and to discriminate against union members in hiring.|$|R
2500|$|Negotiations {{between the}} two {{organizations}} continued for four months. [...] Powderly pledged not to interfere in FOTLU affairs. [...] But <b>craft</b> <b>union</b> members of the Knights were incensed at the treatment their fellow Knights had given them in Cleveland, and they continued to undermine the organization's leadership from within.|$|E
2500|$|The regular General Assembly of the Knights of Labor met in Richmond, Virginia in October 1886. Once more, Powderly {{was unable}} to bring the Philadelphia {{agreement}} up for debate or a vote. [...] Anti-craft union delegates passed a resolution ordering {{all members of the}} Cigar-Makers' International Union to leave that organization and join the Progressive Cigar-makers or forfeit their membership in the Knights. Another resolution set up new national assemblies of <b>craft</b> <b>union</b> members, a direct challenge to FOTLU's international unions.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{companies}} prefer no union whatsoever. However, {{when given}} the choice of an industrial union or a <b>craft</b> <b>union,</b> companies appear to prefer organization by craft unions. As an example, after the American Railway Union was destroyed, Eugene Debs, who had read Marx while serving his sentence, turned to politics, seeking {{solutions to the problems}} of working people through socialism. Some railroad workers in Indiana, Kansas, and Illinois who had been a part of Debs' ARU in 1894 resented the fact that Debs turned to socialism for, ...|$|E
2500|$|Gompers {{had promised}} that each trade and craft would {{have its own}} union. The Scranton Declaration {{acknowledged}} that one affiliate, the United Mine Workers was formed as an industrial union, but that other skilled trades—carpenters, machinists, etc.—were organized as powerful <b>craft</b> <b>unions.</b> These <b>craft</b> <b>unions</b> refused to allow any encroachment upon their [...] "turf" [...] by the heretical industrial unionists. This concept {{came to be known}} as voluntarism. The federation turned the UBRE down in accord with the voluntarism principle. The Scranton Declaration acknowledging voluntarism was adhered to, even though the craft-based railroad brotherhoods had not yet joined the AFL. The AFL was holding the door open for <b>craft</b> <b>unions</b> that might join, and slamming it in the face of the industrial unions who wanted to join. The following year the two thousand member UBRE joined the organizing convention of the IWW.|$|R

2500|$|In 1922, Marion Dutton Savage cataloged the {{disadvantages}} of craft unionism, as observed by industrial union advocates. These included [...] "distressingly frequent disputes between different craft unions" [...] over jurisdiction; modern industry {{results in a}} constant process of phasing out old skills; one trade doing the struck work of another entity is a frequent dilemma; expiration of contracts can be staggered, hindering coordination of strikes. Industrial unionists observe that <b>craft</b> <b>union</b> members are more often required by their contracts to cross the picket lines established by workers in other unions. Likewise, in a strike of (for example) coal miners, unionized railroad workers may be required by their contracts to haul [...] "scab" [...] coal.|$|E
2500|$|The AFL {{continued}} {{to fight the}} CIO, forcing the NLRB to allow skilled trades employees in large industrial facilities the option to choose, in {{what came to be}} called [...] "Globe elections," [...] between representation by the CIO or separate representation by AFL craft unions. The CIO now also faced competition, moreover, from a number of AFL affiliates who now sought to organize industrial workers. The competition was particularly sharp in the aircraft industry, where the UAW went head-to-head against the International Association of Machinists, originally a <b>craft</b> <b>union</b> of railroad workers and skilled trade employees. [...] The AFL organizing drives proved even more successful, and they gained new members as fast or faster than the CIO.|$|E
2500|$|The Farmer board also {{reversed}} {{policy on}} [...] "craft" [...] units. The American Federation of Labor had long adhered to {{a policy of}} craft unionism, where workers with similar skills (a [...] "craft") belonged to the same union. In contrast, the Congress of Industrial Organizations believed in industrial unionism, in which all workers in the same industry are organized into the same union regardless of differences in skill. Early in the NLRB's history, the board held {{that if there was}} a history of industrial bargaining, craft workers should not be permitted to create a distinct craft bargaining unit. The rationale was that established labor relations should not be upset, and that <b>craft</b> <b>union</b> raids on industrial units should be avoided in the name of labor peace. In American Potash & Chemical Corp., the Board overturned 15 years of precedent and permitted craft bargaining units to be carved out of industrial bargaining units if the workers voted for this outcome.|$|E

[...] McGuire, Strasser, Dyer, Fitzpatrick and Foster issued a {{national}} to all <b>craft</b> trade <b>unions</b> to hold a national conference in Columbus, Ohio on December 8, 1886. Forty-two delegates from 25 labor organizations, 13 national unions and 12 local unions and city labor councils assembled in Columbus.|$|R

50|$|In part {{this was}} caused by two new ideas of {{unionism}}: trade unionism and industrial unionism. Trade unionists sought to organise all people engaged in the same trade on job sites. Rather than simply organising the ditch diggers into one <b>craft</b> <b>union</b> and the dirt movers into another <b>craft</b> <b>union,</b> trade unionists sought to organise all people who moved earth into one union.|$|E

5000|$|While <b>craft</b> <b>unions</b> {{provided}} a good defense for {{the privileges of}} membership, conventions such as time-limited contracts and pledges not to strike in solidarity with other workers severely limited the ability of <b>craft</b> <b>unions</b> to effect change in society at large, leaving only the ineffectual means granted by a business-dominated elite society, i.e., electoral politics, lobbying congress, and a newly enfeebled economic weapon, the injunction-circumscribed strike. But the AFL embraced this [...] "businesslike" [...] and [...] "pragmatic" [...] worldview, adopting the motto, [...] "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work." ...|$|R
