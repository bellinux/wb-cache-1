40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the diets of cattle at risk to DABPE on stress and inciting pastures and to determine if segregated feeding groups of cattle displayed differential susceptibility to DABPE. Stress pastures were classified and mapped by plant communities and segregated feeding group areas. Cattle diets were determined for each segregated feeding group area. Cattle were marked to identify each individual {{as a member of a}} particular group. Major dietary species on the stress pastures were Kentucky bluegrass, Idaho fescue, bluebunch wheatgrass, elk sedge, yellow sweetclover, and American vetch. Major dietary species on the inciting pastures were alfalfa, <b>common</b> <b>timothy,</b> smooth brome, Kentucky bluegrass, and reed canarygrass. Twenty cows whose activities could be traced back to a specific area on the stress pasture contracted DABPE during the study. Two similarities were common to 19 of the 20 cows stricken with the disease. Nineteen of these cows had grazed on areas of the stress pasture where the diet was lower in percent dry matter than the diets on the driest areas of the same stress pasture. The same cows all had grazed areas on the stress pasture where Kentucky bluegrass was the dominant dietary species. However, there was not sufficient evidence to conclude that Kentucky bluegrass was a causative agent of DABPE. Forty-three cows between the age of five and twelve years showed signs of DABPE during the two year study. Thirty-two cows were stricken on the Izee inciting pasture in 1974 (20 percent overall morbidity) and seven died (22 percent mortality of those animals stricken). Only nine of the 32 stricken cows could be traced back to specific areas on the stress pasture. Thirty-three cows had grazed on the two stress pasture areas that appeared to be associated with DABPE. The nine stricken cows accounted for a morbidity of 27 percent and a mortality of 33 percent. Nine cows showed signs of DABPEon the Rockpile inciting pasture in 1974 (17 percent overall morbidity) and none died. All nine were from two specific stress pasture areas. Twenty-five cows had grazed on the two stress pasture areas that appeared to be associated with DABPE. The nine stricken cows accounted for a morbidity of 36 percent. Cattle were drylotted and introduced over a period of six days to the Izee inciting pasture in 1975. No cases of DABPE were noted. Two cows showed signs of DABPE on the Rockpile inciting pasture in 1975 (2. 8 percent overall morbidity) and one died. Both cows had grazed the same area on the stress pasture in a group of 20 cows. When cattle were drylotted for three to six days while being gradually introduced to the inciting pastures no mortality from DABPE was noted. Prior to drylotting neither ranch had experienced zero mortality from DABPE for at least ten years...|$|E
5000|$|Phalaris angusta is {{a species}} of grass known by the <b>common</b> names <b>timothy</b> canarygrass and narrow canarygrass. It is native to the Americas, where it is most common in Chile and Argentina {{and can be found}} in {{northern}} South America and sections of the southwestern and southeastern United States. It is also known as an introduced species in Australia. It grows in grassland, prairie, marshland, and other habitat.|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} children suffering from allergic diseases could {{be caused by}} sensitization of immature immune system during the intrauterine development. Several important scientific papers have demonstrated the ability of cord blood cells to respond by elevated proliferation activity after stimulation by common allergens. Following these findings, present study follows the production of cytokines which {{play a role in}} the pro- and anti-allergenic tuning of the immune system. Umbilical cord blood cells were stimulated with polyclonal activators (phytohaemagglutinin) and <b>common</b> allergens (ovalbumin, <b>timothy</b> grass, birch, mite). Subsequently, cytokine production was monitored using selected methods that reflect different stages of cell activation - at the level of mRNA by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), by flow cytometry detection of the presence of intracellular cytokines in different cell subpopulations and by ELISA measurement of cytokines in CBMC culture supernatants. The results obtained point to a very weak ability of these <b>common</b> allergens (<b>timothy</b> grass, birch, mite, ovalbumin) to stimulate CBMC to produce cytokines observed by all of these methodological procedures. Although we did not observe significant differences in CBMC cytokine production (IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 12, [...] ...|$|R
25|$|The most {{striking}} sign of Timothy syndrome is the co-occurrence of both syndactyly (~0.03% of births) and long QT syndrome (1% per year) {{in a single}} patient. Other <b>common</b> symptoms of <b>Timothy</b> syndrome are cardiac arrhythmia (94%), heart malformations (59%), autism or an autism spectrum disorder (80% who survive long enough for evaluation). Facial dysmorphologies such as flattened noses also occur in approximately half of patients. Children with this disorder have small teeth which, due to poor enamel coating, are prone to dental cavities and often require removal. The average age of death due to complications of these symptoms is 2.5 years.|$|R
5000|$|Long-distance cattle driving was {{traditional}} in Mexico, California and Texas, {{and horse}} herds were sometimes similarly driven. The Spaniards had established the ranching {{industry in the}} New World, and began driving herds northward from Mexico beginning in the 1540s. Small Spanish settlements in Texas derived much of their revenue from horses and cattle driven into Louisiana, though such trade was usually illegal. Cattle driving over long distances also {{took place in the}} United States, although infrequently. Relatively long-distance herding of hogs was also <b>common.</b> In 1815 <b>Timothy</b> Flint [...] "encountered a drove of more than 1,000 cattle and swine" [...] being driven from the interior of Ohio to Philadelphia. The stock in settled areas was gentle, often managed on foot.|$|R
