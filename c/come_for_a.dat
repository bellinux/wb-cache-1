He covered for his ruse by claiming that he was travelling with United States military adviser Colonel Jasper Wilson and stating that he had <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dental appointment. This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps {{earlier in the day}} with a message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had actually done was to send Wilson to Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} vehicles, {{also known}} as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), {{and are expected to}} be commercially available around 2020. According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasure—could reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades. This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public self-driving taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need—a bus could <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> group of people, a limousine could <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> special night out, and a Segway could <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> short trip down the street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.|$|E

Agnes is shocked by the change in Rosalie from a merry girl to an unhappy young woman. Rosalie confides that she despises Sir Thomas Ashby (and her mother-in-law), and claims he only left London because he was jealous of all the gentlemen she was attracting. Agnes also hears that Mr. Weston has left the area, and she grieves, believing {{she will not be}} able to see him again.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1980s a {{generation}} of New York City musicians had come of age playing both salsa dance music and jazz. The time had <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new level of integration of jazz and Cuban rhythms. This era of creativity and vitality is best represented by the Gonzalez brothers of Conjunto Libre (as the band was originally called). Jerry Gonzalez founded the jazz group the Fort Apache Band, which included his brother Andy and established a new standard for Latin jazz. During this same period, Tito Puente changed to performing and recording primarily Latin jazz {{for the remainder of}} his career. By 1989 Eddie Palmieri had also switched to playing mostly Latin jazz.|$|E

His next match at a major level did not <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> further ten years, when he was selected to appear for the Saint Kitts national team in the inaugural 2006 edition of the Stanford 20/20, which featured 21 teams from around the Caribbean region. In the match, played against Nevis, he scored only a single run in Saint Kitts' first innings, with the team losing by seven wickets to be knocked out of the tournament in the first round.|$|E
25|$|During his 14 {{years as}} Prime Minister, Davíð became acquainted with, {{or a friend}} of, many Western leaders, {{including}} Bill Clinton and George W. Bush of the United States, Václav Klaus of Czechoslovakia and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy. He has occasionally attended the meetings of the Bilderberg Group, and has read a paper to the Mont Pelerin Society. But he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs for only one year. In autumn 2005, Davíð {{announced that he would}} leave politics, saying that he felt the time had <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new generation to take over. His close ally over many years, Geir H. Haarde, replaced him, as both leader of the Independence Party and Minister of Foreign Affairs. A probable contribution to this decision was a short, but dramatic, bout of cancer, soon after the crisis over the failure of the media bill. He is in remission.|$|E
25|$|The second mission, {{scheduled}} for launch in July 2020, {{will have an}} 1800kg Russian-built landing platform system derived from the 2016 Schiaparelli EDM lander, to place the ExoMars rover {{on the surface of}} Mars. This lander platform will be built 80% by the Russian company Lavochkin, and 20% by ESA. Lavochkin will produce most of the landing system's hardware, while ESA will handle elements such as the guidance, radar and navigation systems. Lavochkin's current landing strategy is to use two parachutes; one will open while the module is still moving at supersonic speed, and another will deploy once the probe has been slowed down to subsonic velocity. The heat shield will eventually fall away from the entry capsule to allow the ExoMars rover, riding its retro-rocket-equipped lander, to <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> soft landing on legs or struts. The surface platform lander will then deploy ramps for the rover to drive down.|$|E

500|$|In Camelot on New Year's Day, King Arthur's {{court is}} exchanging gifts {{and waiting for}} the feasting to start when the king asks first to see or hear of an {{exciting}} adventure. A gigantic figure, entirely green in appearance and riding a green horse, rides unexpectedly into the hall. He wears no armour but bears an axe {{in one hand and a}} holly bough in the other. Refusing to fight anyone there on the grounds that they are all too weak to take him on, he insists he has <b>come</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> friendly [...] "Christmas game": someone is to strike him once with his axe on condition that the Green Knight may return the blow in a year and a day. The splendid axe will belong to whoever takes him on. Arthur himself is prepared to accept the challenge when it appears no other knight will dare, but Sir Gawain, youngest of Arthur's knights and his nephew, begs for the honour instead. The giant bends and bares his neck before him and Gawain neatly beheads him in one stroke. However, the Green Knight neither falls nor falters, but instead reaches out, picks up his severed head and remounts, holding up his bleeding head to Queen Guinevere while its writhing lips remind Gawain that the two must meet again at the Green Chapel. He then rides away. Gawain and Arthur admire the axe, hang it up as a trophy and encourage Guinevere to treat the whole matter lightly.|$|E
