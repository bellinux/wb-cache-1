40|$|International audienceRead {{and write}} assist {{techniques}} are widely adopted to allow voltage scaling in low-power SRAMs. In particular, this paper analyzes two assist techniques: word line level reduction and negative bit line boost. The analyzed assist techniques improve read stability and write margin of core-cells when the SRAM operates at a lowered supply voltage. In this work, we investigate {{the impact of}} such assist techniques on the faulty behavior of low-power SRAMs. This analysis is based on extensive injection of resistive-open and resistive-bridging defects in core-cells of a commercial low-power SRAM. Our study determines the most stressful <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> assist <b>circuits</b> to detect each faulty behavior induced by injected defects. We show that applying most stressful <b>configurations</b> <b>of</b> assist <b>circuits</b> during test phase can increase defect coverage up to 89 % w. r. t. test solutions that do not exploit assist circuits. Based on this analysis, we present an efficient test solution that exploits the <b>configuration</b> <b>of</b> assist <b>circuits</b> as a parameter to maximize the detection of studied defects, while reducing time complexity up to 33 % w. r. t state-of-the-art test algorithms...|$|R
