25|$|On March 17, 1994, Stanfa and 23 of his {{men were}} arrested on {{racketeering}} related chargers. This was the second major indictment on the crime family in seven years. The Federal case was the largest prosecution of an organized crime group in Philadelphia history. The second major indictment against the crime family was another strong <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> A key piece of evidence was two years of recorded conversations Stanfa would have with mobsters in his attorney's office and doctor's office. Believing attorney–client privilege and doctor-patient confidentiality would protect him, Stanfa openly talked about important Mafia business with his men. However, the FBI {{was able to get}} a warrant to place covert listening devices in both offices once they figured out they were being used to aid criminal conspiracies. The secretly recorded conversations implicated Stanfa and his men of many criminal acts. The star witness at the trial was John Veasey, who was recruited by Stanfa to fight in the war against Merlino and eventually was inducted into the family. Before this, Veasey had no connection to the Mafia or organized crime.|$|E
25|$|Counsel for the Public Prosecutor {{opens his}} or her case by stating shortly {{the nature of the}} offence charged and the {{evidence}} by which the accused's guilt is proposed to be proved. The prosecution witnesses are then examined, cross-examined for the defence and, if necessary, re-examined by the prosecution. When the <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> is concluded, the defence may invite the Court to dismiss the case on the basis that there is no case to answer. The Court must decide whether there is evidence against the accused which is not inherently incredible and which satisfies every element of the charge against him or her. If there is no such evidence, the accused must be acquitted. If the Court finds that a case against the accused has been made out, it must call on the accused to give {{his or her}} defence. It is up to the accused {{to decide whether or not}} to offer a defence. If the accused elects to do so, he or she, or his or her advocate, may open the case for the defence, stating the facts or law on which the accused intends to rely and commenting on the evidence for the prosecution. The accused may then examine his or her witnesses, and after their cross-examination by the prosecution and re-examination by the defence, may sum up his or her case. The prosecution may then call persons as witnesses or recall persons already examined for re-examination for rebuttal purposes, and such rebuttal witnesses may be cross-examined by the defence and re-examined by the prosecution. Whether or not the accused has adduced evidence, the prosecution has the right to reply on the whole case.|$|E
500|$|Dietrich {{suggested}} {{three different}} sources in {{law for the}} right to counsel that he asserted. The first was section 397 of the Victorian Crimes Act 1958, (now repealed), which provided that [...] "every accused person shall be admitted after the close of the <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> to make full answer and defence thereto by legal practitioner". However, the court found that this provision only means that an accused is entitled to counsel paid for by themselves or someone else, and not counsel provided by the state.|$|E

500|$|Sir Archibald Bodkin, the Director of Public Prosecutions, {{set out the}} <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> The {{evidence}} was overwhelming; the prosecution case highlighted the contents of Lody's notebook and the luggage that he had left at the Roxburgh Hotel, and called a series of witnesses, including the elderly Scottish woman who ran the boarding-house {{in which he had}} stayed in Edinburgh and the fashionably dressed Ida McClyment, who caused a stir when she described her meeting with Lody aboard the London to Edinburgh train. Bodkin did not read the incriminating letters aloud, due to the sensitivity of their content, but described them in general terms. The witnesses testified about their interactions with Lody and identified him as the man who had posed as [...] "Charles A. Inglis", though the proprietress of the Edinburgh boarding-house experienced some difficulty. When she [...] "was asked if she could see 'Charles A. Inglis' in court, [...] looked everywhere except at the dock. Lody, who was sitting, stood up and gently waved his hands to attract her attention, while he smiled broadly and almost broke into laughter at the absurdity of the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{was again}} arrested on 13 January 2004. Police {{said at the}} time that the murder file had never been closed, and that the arrest {{followed}} new leads. These new leads were later reported to be a confession by Michael Wainwright, who claimed to have been a cellmate of Gordon's during his short prison stay in 1997. The police then revisited the site where the body was discovered, and found a piece of Westmorland green slate, a stone that matched the rocks that made up the wall of the family's bungalow. The case was brought to trial at Manchester Crown Court, and lasted ten weeks. There was no single piece of evidence that pointed to Gordon indisputably, but the prosecution argued that when the evidence was placed together, it could only point at Park, and not a [...] "mysterious stranger or secret lover". Primarily, the <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> rested on circumstantial evidence, with the jury being asked to consider knots, rocks used to weight down the body and the ice axe, all linking Gordon Park to the crime. However, the statements of Michael Wainwright, and another of Gordon's cellmates, who had learning difficulties, were also used as evidence by the prosecution. He was sentenced to be jailed for life, and told that he must serve at least 15 years. The judge said that he had taken into account the [...] "terrible concealment" [...] of the body.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} based on the customs official's testimony that Corby said the bag was hers, and that it was found to contain 4.2kg of cannabis.

5000|$|The {{film was}} {{directed}} by Errol Morris and scored by Philip Glass. Morris was originally going to film a documentary about prosecution psychiatrist Dr. James Grigson, known as Doctor Death, who testified in more than 100 trials that resulted in death sentences. As an expert psychiatrist, Dr. Grigson {{made a name for}} himself by giving testimony in capital <b>cases</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution.</b> Under <b>the</b> law in Texas, the death penalty can only be issued if the jury is convinced that the defendant is not just guilty, but will commit violent crimes in the future if not put to death. In almost every instance, Dr. Grigson would, after examining a defendant, testify that he had found the individual in question to be an incurable sociopath, who he was [...] "one hundred percent certain" [...] would kill again. Grigson told the jury that Adams would be an ongoing menace if kept alive but Morris, after meeting Adams, became skeptical that he committed the crime.|$|R
5000|$|The case {{represented}} a successful cooperation between multiple agencies {{from both the}} United States and the United Kingdom, leading to a complex court <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Crown <b>Prosecution</b> Service (CPS). <b>The</b> case against Hardison was made more unusual by his decision to represent himself in court and argue, on human rights grounds, that [...] "taking psychoactive drugs was an innocent act and the only crime he had committed was against the state". These issues combined led to the case being {{one of only three}} highlighted in the annual report of Sussex CPS.|$|R

A hysterical crowd gathers outside the courtroom, as Tom Watson spews invective ("Hammer of Justice") and Hugh Dorsey begins the <b>case</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{prosecution}}</b> ("Twenty Miles from Marietta"). The prosecution produces a series of witnesses, most of whom give trumped evidence which was clearly fed to them by Dorsey. Frankie Epps testifies, falsely, that Mary mentioned that Frank [...] "looks at her funny" [...] when they last spoke, a sentiment echoed verbatim by three of Mary’s teenage co-workers, Iola, Essie, and Monteen ("The Factory Girls"). In a fantasy sequence, Frank becomes the lecherous seducer of their testimony ("Come Up to My Office"). Testimony is heard from Mary's mother ("My Child Will Forgive Me") and Minnie McKnight before the prosecution's star witness, Jim Conley, takes the stand, claiming that he witnessed the murder and helped Frank cover up the crime ("That's What He Said").|$|E

500|$|By early 1918, British {{women who}} had {{attained}} the age of 30 were given {{the right to vote}} and hold office. Following the passing of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919, which enabled women to become members of the legal profession, Macmillan applied to Middle Temple as a pupil barrister. She was called to the bar on 28 January 1924 and in 1926 joined the Western Circuit, becoming only the second women to be elected to its Bar Mess. Between then and 1929 she acted as counsel <b>for</b> defence in <b>the</b> six cases in which she appeared on the Circuit, and she took 65 cases in the North London Session courts between 1927 and 1936. From 1929, she appeared at the Central Criminal Court in five <b>cases</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> and one <b>for</b> defence [...] There are no records available <b>for</b> her civil <b>cases.</b> As she was studying <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bar, she co-founded the Open Door Council <b>for</b> <b>the</b> repeal of legal restraints on women. Macmillan worked to lift restrictions and so give women of all stations an equal opportunity in the workplace. NUWSS was re-organised in 1918 as the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship, but Macmillan disagreed with the group's stance on protective legislation for women workers. In 1929, she co-founded a global group, the Open Door International <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Economic Emancipation of the Woman Worker—she served as president of this group until her death.|$|R

5000|$|Both in the [...] "solemn" [...] and the [...] "summary" [...] acquittals, {{not proven}} is {{interpreted}} as {{indicating that the}} jury or judge, respectively, is not convinced of the innocence of the accused; in fact, they may be morally convinced that the accused is guilty, but do not find <b>the</b> proofs sufficient <b>for</b> a conviction.

Thus, {{there might be a}} single plaintiff or witness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> which <b>the</b> jury or judge believes is both truthful and trustworthy, but no other witness or circumstances against the accused.

5000|$|Initially, {{the two men}} {{involved}} {{were charged}} as adults with first-degree rape.

Baby appealed {{on the grounds that the}} trial judge had refused to answer questions from the jury on whether rape includes consensual intercourse that becomes non-consensual. In 2006 the Maryland Court of Special Appeals held that the judge should have answered in the negative, reversed Baby's convictions, and remanded <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> re-trial. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> cross-appealed to <b>the</b> state Court of Appeals.
