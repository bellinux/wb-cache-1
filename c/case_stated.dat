5|$|By the 1960s, {{even before}} the {{increase}} of abuse of the <b>Case</b> <b>Stated</b> procedure, the United Kingdom {{was estimated to be}} losing £500 million a year through the movement of arbitration business to other countries. In response, the Lord Chancellor convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the conclusion was that the status quo should remain. With the increased use of the <b>Case</b> <b>Stated</b> procedure, more calls for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage current law was causing. In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the system so that appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or both parties to the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use of the <b>Case</b> <b>Stated</b> procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.|$|E

In the UK courts, on 21 March 2011, Paul Allen, a trustee of the Jacobs estate, was ordered to pay as security to the court 65% of the costs faced by Bloomsbury and Rowling, amounting to over £1.5million, to avoid the claim being struck out. It was reported in The Bookseller that Paul Allen has appealed against paying this sum. As a condition of the appeal, he paid £50,000 to the court in May 2011. The claim was formally struck out in July 2011 after the deadline for Allen's initial payment was missed.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{followers}} (called Rajneeshees) of charismatic leader Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (now {{known as}} Osho), {{were convicted of}} a 1985 conspiracy to assassinate Charles Turner, and an additional unindicted eighth member of the Rajneesh commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. The perpetrators were high-ranking followers within the Rajneeshee organization. Prosecutors in the <b>case</b> <b>stated</b> that the perpetrators had planned to murder Turner after he was appointed to head {{an investigation into the}} group's activities in Rajneeshpuram, Oregon. Turner's investigation focused on sham marriages organized by the group, as well as other illegal activities including immigration fraud, and he later headed the federal prosecution relating to the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The Dalles, Oregon. Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer was also involved in investigations of the group, working alongside Turner.|$|E
500|$|Before the 1979 Act, English law did {{not provide}} many ways to avoid the <b>Case</b> <b>Stated</b> procedure, even prohibiting parties from agreeing in advance not to use it; {{this was due to}} Scrutton LJ's statement, in Czarnikow v Roth, Schmidt & Co, that [...] "There must be no Alsatia in England where the King's writ does not run". In The Lysland, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales gave a {{decision}} interpreted as saying that the courts must consider a <b>Case</b> <b>Stated</b> [...] "even if there is no great some in dispute, no point of general importance is involved or the answer is reasonably clear". Lord Denning's statement in that case has been described as [...] "he death knell of arbitrator autonomy", and led to arbitrators almost automatically asking for judicial supervision for fear that they would otherwise be found to have committed misconduct. For obvious reasons, companies and parties to a case who submit their issues to arbitration expect something private, quick, and cheap, with fixed results. The traditional English emphasis on judicial oversight, therefore, meant that with the <b>Case</b> <b>Stated</b> procedure, London was a highly unpopular venue for arbitration.|$|E

500|$|According to Case, Sharon {{loses her}} {{identity}} after her divorce from Nick, {{which leads to}} her beginning a romance with Phyllis's ex-husband Jack Abbott, played by Peter Bergman. They marry in April 2007, but divorce two years later {{as a result of}} Jack's dishonesty which severely weakened the marriage. Case praised the pairing for its accurate representation of a [...] "modern marriage" [...] and noted that Sharon could not deal with Jack's [...] "broken promises again and again". Years before marrying Jack, Sharon had a brief affair with Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). Case believed that the romance could have been further explored. During a blizzard, Brad visits Sharon at the Abbott cabin and declares his love for her, although she rejects him. Moments later, Brad is killed while saving her son, Noah, from drowning in an icy lake; he falls through the ice himself. <b>Case</b> <b>stated</b> that Sharon was guilty over Brad's tragic death.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{reforms are}} found in Section 1 of the Act. Section 1(1) repeals Section 21 of the 1950 Act, abolishing the <b>Case</b> <b>Stated</b> {{procedure}} in arbitration matters, and states that the courts cannot set aside a decision based on an error in law or fact that is blatantly obvious, effectively repealing Section 22(1). Instead, Sections 1(2) and 1(3) provide that an appeal may be made [...] "on any question of law arising out of an award made on an arbitration agreement", if either the High Court agrees the appeal is valid, or if both parties to the arbitration request it. In Petraco (Bermuda) Ltd v Petromed International, the Court of Appeal was asked to explain what guidelines should be applied by a High Court judge when deciding {{whether or not to}} grant an appeal. The High Court had refused leave to appeal, because a point was raised which had not been mentioned during arbitration.

500|$|Despite the clemency, Vane {{remained}} in the Tower, and the income from his estates was seized. [...] He suffered the privations of the prison, {{and was unable to}} discharge debts that ran to £10,000. [...] He was transferred to the Isles of Scilly in October 1661 in order to limit access to him by potential conspirators who might be scheming to free him. [...] He continued to write, principally on religious themes, seeking {{to come to terms with}} the political state of affairs and his condition. [...] According to The People's <b>Case</b> <b>Stated,</b> written by Vane in this time, power originated with God, but resided primarily with the people: [...] "The power which is directive, and states and ascertains the morality of the rule of obedience, is in the hand of God; but the original, from whence all just power arises, which is magistratical and co-ercitive, is from the will or free gift of the people, who may either keep the power in themselves or give up their subjection and will in the hand of another." [...] King and people were bound by [...] "the fundamental constitution or compact", which if the king violated, the people might return to their original right and freedom.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, {{following}} {{independence from}} Great Britain, the phrase was not commonly used. However, {{when the first}} death sentence was passed in Taos County, New Mexico, the judge used the phrase but immediately followed it with a statement that the court would not be responsible for asking [...] "an all wise providence" [...] to do something the jury could not do due to the American principle of {{separation of church and}} state. In the 19th century, due to American law moving away from moral judgments based on Christian principles towards the principle of a judgment that was [...] "beyond reasonable doubt", the phrases [...] "not having the fear of God before your eyes" [...] and [...] "may God have mercy upon your soul" [...] were the very few remainders within the American court system of the British colonial morality-based trials. Despite this, [...] "may God have mercy on your soul" [...] {{has been used as a}} closing statement in modern times by American judges when passing a sentence of death. Sometimes as it is mandated by state law, other times as a result of legal tradition. For example, in 2011, it was used when a judge sentenced a murderer to death in South Dakota. A version of the phrase was used by [...] a Florida judge when Aileen Wuornos was sentenced to death, the judge in this <b>case</b> <b>stated</b> [...] "and may God have mercy on your corpse".|$|E

[...] In August 2012, Victor and Sharon married a second time, and when he disappeared shortly after, {{she thought he was}} abandoning her. Sharon later burned their prenuptial agreement, and took over this company. Talking about the situation, <b>Case</b> <b>stated</b> that the writers could have done this storyline [...] "a million other ways" [...] without [...] "marrying him [...] ". In another interview, she spoke thoroughly of the relationship, labeling it incestuous. She stated: [...] "Sometimes controversial storylines can work because you're bringing attention to a controversial issue that the nation is trying to decide on. But this was not one of those things. Everybody is universally against incest! It was just so upsetting to the audience. Whenever the actors went to do , the fans would bring it up. Literally, every actor in the building was coming up to me, giving me feedback that they were getting about it!" [...] When asked if the marriage was about [...] "daddy issues", Case said: [...] "That's usually the case in a story like that, but I don't think it's one most people want to watch!" [...] Victor later returned home and annulled their second marriage. During an interview with The Province, Michael Muhney, who portrays Victor's son Adam, said that Victor and Sharon's marriage was [...] "almost like an inside joke".|$|E

500|$|Victor {{was noted}} for his {{controversial}} relationship {{with both of}} his sons' ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), with whom he initially had a [...] father-daughter relationship. In 2003, Victor and Sharon shared a kiss, causing issues in her marriage to Nicholas; she left town to [...] "find herself". Victor supported Sharon throughout her legal problems, and paid her bail at first when she was wrongly convicted of murder in 2011. <b>Case</b> <b>stated</b> that she thinks Sharon thinks of Victor [...] "in a way like a father figure, but not quite. When she was younger she saw him as that, and then when she grew up she saw him less as a father {{and more like a}} hero", also stating that Victor is Sharon's [...] "security blanket". The dynamic of their relationship changed when Victor proposed a platonic marriage to Sharon in December 2011, and while they end up marrying, but it is annulled shortly after. However, months after the annulment, they begin a genuine romance. Joshua Morrow, who portrays Nicholas, told Soaps In Depth that he was [...] "always kind of surprised that Nick just accepted this from his dad", and that [...] "there were never any scenes showing legitimate anger". Braeden didn't agree with the pairing either, stating that, [...] "We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't really like to play so much, but you do it." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1995, Los Angeles Times writer Nancy Reichardt {{characterized}} Sharon as [...] "the {{girl from}} {{the wrong side of}} the tracks" [...] with Nekeeta Borden of the entertainment news website Daytime Confidential describing her as being kindhearted and a [...] "" [...] during her early years on the show, noting that she wanted to start her own trends rather than follow other members of the Newman family. Case likened Sharon to a younger Jill Foster Abbott (Jess Walton), telling Soap Opera Weekly that Jill [...] "was kind of like Sharon. She was nice...no one thought she was a gold digger—at first." [...] According to the actress, Sharon does [...] "weird things" [...] and panics when stressed, and her mistakes [...] "eat away at her", as [...] "She doesn't do well with secrets". Case also described the character as feeling insecure and unworthy of being in a happy relationship, telling the Star-Banner that [...] "Sharon goes through many emotions in a week". MSN characterized Sharon as a [...] "bitch" [...] after a storyline in which she took over Newman Enterprises in 2012. Of the writing for her character, Case said it is indispensable: [...] "They both have to be there. I couldn't have gotten away with this without those lines". However, the actress has expressed displeasure with Sharon being paired with [...] "too many men" [...] because it [...] "waters her down", wanting to incorporate different aspects of Sharon into her performance. <b>Case</b> <b>stated</b> that Sharon, who sees visions of her deceased daughter Cassie (Camryn Grimes), believes that [...] "she is connected to the spiritual world".|$|E
500|$|Although Sharon {{also moved}} on, marrying Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Nick and Sharon remain in love. They kiss while Nick, {{suffering}} from amnesia, believes {{they are still}} married; Phyllis is jealous of Sharon, insulting her {{in an article in}} her magazine Restless Style. In January 2009, Nick and Sharon reunite in a sexual affair at the Abbott cabin, an event much anticipated by viewers. According to Case, Sharon wanted Nick more than anyone at the time but only if he left Phyllis; Morrow told TV Guide that although the reunion was [...] "messy", viewers wanted this for a long time. After another one-night stand Sharon becomes pregnant, briefly lying that Jack is the baby's father when Summer becomes ill and Phyllis needs Nick. Nick soon finds out, but their daughter Faith is kidnapped at birth by Nick's brother (Adam) and given to Ashley (Jack's sister). Sharon, believing Faith has died, seduces a guilty Adam. Faith is eventually reunited with her parents, and Adam's crimes are revealed. Nick and Sharon are briefly engaged that November, but they break up when she sleeps with Adam and their relationship becomes bitter. Although Case and Morrow believe the couple belong together, they are apart for several years; during which they both believed a reunion wouldn't happen anytime soon. In late 2013, the characters begin to grow closer again despite the fact that Sharon secretly switched the paternity test results of Nick's daughter Summer; <b>Case</b> <b>stated</b> in an interview that Sharon is in [...] "constant turmoil" [...] regarding her secret, and Morrow stated that he believed a reunion was a possibility given Nick's vulnerability, saying: [...] "They've worked things out before—and they could work things out again. There is always a possibility for Nick and Sharon to get back together!" [...] However, Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "Yet, with Sharon's secret haunting her like the glowering ghost of Christmas past, the supercouple's fans may need a holiday miracle to keep Sharon and Nick's relationship from exploding!" ...|$|E
