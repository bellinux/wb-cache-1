50|$|During first {{decades of}} post-war Spain the trend which clearly prevailed {{when it comes to}} the Carlist theme was {{continuation}} of the wartime-style novels; it was visible in the 1940s but started to dry out and disappeared almost completely in the 1950s. None of the key features changed: nagging moralising objectives, sketchy and Manichean characters, Civil War setting, lively yet predictable plot. As Falange was clearly gaining the upper hand in internal power struggle, also the Falangist historical perspective started to prevail, with Carlist characters relegated to secondary roles in the narrative; this is the case of Rafael García Serrano and his La fiel infanteria (1943), Cuando los dioses nacían en Extremadura (1947), Plaza del Castillo (1951) or Los ojos perdidos (1958). Casariego kept writing, but the most successful of his wartime novels, Con la vida hicieron fuego (1953), did not contain Carlist threads. Re-published a number of times and translated into French, English, German and Italian, it featured a fisherman's son turned navy commander; the novel soon served as screenplay for a movie.

Simultaneously recovering the camera pose and correspondences between {{a set of}} 2 D-image and 3 D-model points is a difficult problem, especially when the 2 D- 3 D matches cannot be established based on appearance only. The problem becomes even more challenging when input images are acquired with an uncalibrated camera with varying zoom, which yields strong ambiguities between translation and focal length. We present {{a solution to this}} problem using only geometrical information. Our approach owes its robustness to an initial stage in which the joint pose and focal length solution space is split into several Gaussian regions. At runtime, each of these regions is explored using an hypothesize-and-test approach, in which the potential number of 2 D- 3 D matches is progressively reduced using informed search through Kalman updates, iteratively refining the pose and focal length parameters.

40|$|Capítulo 1. Dense {{descriptors}} {{are becoming}} increasingly popular {{in a host of}} tasks, such as dense image correspondence, bag-of-words image classification, and label transfer. However, the extraction of descriptors on generic image points, rather than selecting geometric features, requires rethinking how to achieve invariance to nuisance parameters. In this work we pursue invariance to occlusions and background changes by introducing segmentation information within dense feature construction. The core idea is to use the segmentation cues to downplay the features coming from image areas that are unlikely to belong to the same region as the feature point. We show how to integrate this idea with dense SIFT, {{as well as with the}} dense scale- and rotation-invariant descriptor (SID). We thereby deliver dense descriptors that are invariant to background changes, rotation, and/or scaling. We explore the merit of our technique in conjunction with large displacement motion estimation and wide-baseline stereo, and demonstrate that exploiting segmentation information yields clear improvements.

40|$|Trabajo presentado a la CVPR celebrada en Portland del 23 al 28 de junio de 2013. We {{introduce}} {{a novel approach}} to automatically recover 3 D human pose from a single image. Most previous work follows a pipelined approach: initially, a set of 2 D features such as edges, joints or silhouettes are detected in the image, and then these observations are used to infer the 3 D pose. Solving these two problems separately may lead to erroneous 3 D poses when the feature detector has performed poorly. In this paper, we address this issue by jointly solving both the 2 D detection and the 3 D inference problems. For this purpose, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates a generative model based on latent variables and discriminative 2 D part detectors based on HOGs, and perform inference using evolutionary algorithms. Real experimentation demonstrates competitive results, {{and the ability of}} our methodology to provide accurate 2 D and 3 D pose estimations even when the 2 D detectors are inaccurate.

While recent {{approaches}} {{have shown that}} it is possible to do template matching by exhaustively scanning the parameter space, the resulting algorithms are still quite demanding. In this paper we alleviate the computational load of these algorithms by proposing an efficient approach for predicting the match ability of a template, before it is actually performed. This avoids large amounts of unnecessary computations. We learn the match ability of templates by using dense convolutional neural network descriptors that do not require ad-hoc criteria to characterize a template. By using deep learning descriptions of patches we are able to predict match ability over the whole image quite reliably. We will also show how no specific training data is required to solve problems like panorama stitching in which you usually require data from the scene in question.

In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{simultaneously}} recovering the 3 D shape and pose of a deformable and potentially elastic object from 2 D motion. This is a highly ambiguous problem typically tackled by using low-rank shape and trajectory constraints. We show that formulating the problem in terms of a low-rank force space that induces the deformation, allows for a better physical interpretation of the resulting priors and a more accurate representation of the actual object's behavior. However, this comes at the price of, besides force and pose, having to estimate the elastic model of the object. For this, we use an Expectation Maximization strategy, where each of these parameters are successively learned within partial M-steps, while robustly dealing with missing observations. We thoroughly validate the approach on both mocap and real sequences, showing more accurate 3 D reconstructions than state-of-the-art, and additionally providing an estimate of the full elastic model with no a priori information.

We propose a new learning approach that (a) requires only a set of state transitions to learn the model; (b) can cope with uncertainty in the effects; (c) uses a relational representation to generalize over different objects; and (d) in addition to action effects, it can also learn exogenous effects that are not related to any action, e. g., moving objects, endogenous growth and natural development. The proposed learning approach combines a multi-valued variant of inductive logic programming for the generation of candidate models, with an optimization method to select the best set of planning operators to model a problem.

We propose an {{efficient}} Human Robot Interaction approach to efficiently model {{the appearance of}} all relevant objects in robot's environment. Given an input video stream recorded while the robot is navigating, the user just needs to annotate {{a very small number}} of frames to build specific classifiers for each of the objects of interest. At the core of the method, there are several random ferns classifiers that share the same features and are updated online. The resulting methodology is fast (runs at 8 fps), versatile (it can be applied to unconstrained scenarios), scalable (real experiments show we can model up to 30 different object classes), and minimizes the amount of human intervention by leveraging the uncertainty measures associated to each classifier. We thoroughly validate the approach on synthetic data and on real sequences acquired with a mobile platform in outdoor and challenging scenarios containing a multitude of different objects.

Most current depth sensors provide 2. 5 D range {{images in}} which depth values are {{assigned}} to a rectangular 2 D array. In this paper we {{take advantage of this}} structured information to build an efficient shape descriptor which is about two orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches, while showing similar performance in several tasks involving deformable object recognition. Given a 2 D patch surrounding a point and its associated depth values, we build the descriptor for that point, based on the cumulative distances between their normals and a discrete set of normal directions. This processing is made very efficient using integral images, even allowing to compute descriptors for every range image pixel in a few seconds. The discriminative power of our descriptor, dubbed FINDDD, is evaluated in three different scenarios: recognition of specific cloth wrinkles, instance recognition from geometry alone, and detection of reliable and informed grasping points.

We present a novel approach for feature correspondence and multiple structure discovery in computer vision. In contrast to existing methods, we exploit the fact that point-sets on the same structure usually lie close to each other, thus forming clusters in the image. Given a pair of input images, we initially extract points of interest and extract hierarchical representations by agglomerative clustering. We use the maximum weighted clique problem to find the set of corresponding clusters with maximum number of inliers representing the multiple structures at the correct scales. Our method is parameter-free and only needs two sets of points along with their tentative correspondences, thus being extremely easy to use. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in multiple-structure fitting experiments in both publicly available and in-house datasets.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for matching sets of branching curvilinear structures that form graphs embedded in ℝ 2 or ℝ 3 and {{may be subject to}} deformations. Unlike earlier methods, ours does not rely on local appearance similarity nor does require a good initial alignment. Furthermore, it can cope with non-linear deformations, topological differences, and partial graphs. To handle arbitrary non-linear deformations, we use Gaussian process regressions to represent the geometrical mapping relating the two graphs. In the absence of appearance information, we iteratively establish correspondences between points, update the mapping accordingly, and use it to estimate where to find the most likely correspondences that will be used in the next step. To make the computation tractable for large graphs, the set of new potential matches considered at each iteration is not selected at random as with many RANSAC-based algorithms. Instead, we introduce a so-called Active Testing Search strategy that performs a priority search to favor the most likely matches and speed-up the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach first on synthetic cases and then on angiography data, retinal fundus images, and microscopy image stacks acquired at very different resolutions.
