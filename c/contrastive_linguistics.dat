The type of corpora used in <b>contrastive</b> corpus <b>linguistics</b> is first discussed, which is followed by a summary of the findings from a published contrastive study of passive constructions in English and Chinese based on comparable corpora of the two languages. These findings are in turn used to predict and diagnose the performance of Chinese learners of English in their use of English passives as mirrored in a sizeable Chinese learner English corpus in comparison with a comparable native English corpus...|$|R

It aims to analyse and compare the distribution of different parts of speech in Old English and Old High German, thus providing a quantitative basis for further conclusions concerning different patterns of the development of those two West-Germanic languages. A particular attention has been devoted to the frequencies of prepositions and pronouns, as there are considerable differences between the languages in this respect.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{establishment}} of modern scientific language {{in the late nineteenth century}} was instrumental in the making of China's and Japan's early modern scientific identity. The current study aims to offer an original empirical investigation of early modern Chinese scientific terminology from a cognitive and functional perspective, which has been rarely explored before. Through a detailed corpus-based linguistic investigation, the present study probes the complex historical process of cross-cultural and cross-linguistic scientific exchange between the West and China and Japan in the late nineteenth century. The new insights brought about by the novel use of statistical methods point to potentially prolific directions for future research in <b>contrastive</b> historical <b>linguistics</b> and science history...|$|R

Notably, rather than once again considering the already much studied syntactic and lexical Hellenisms (Grecisms) of Old Church Slavonic, attention is focused on the semitisms (which entered via Greek, hence also referred to as "pseudo-Hellenisms") and the vernacular (non-literary) Byzantinisms of the earliest liturgical and written language of the Slavs. Yet, the latter do at most qualify as nascent (incipient) Balkanisms only...|$|R

40|$|Cross-linguistic {{research}} on phraseology covers {{a wide range}} of challenging topics, from the simple comparison of idioms or metaphors in two languages, to the systematic contrastive study of all categories of set phrases across different languages. Current research demonstrates that phraseology in the broad sense {{is one of the key}} components of language, and is probably universal. However, the theoretical debate on the definition of set phrases and the interaction between culture, meaning, syntax, figurative language and phraseology is not yet completely settled. Two major theoretical approaches have so far yielded promising results: the first is more semantic and is often associated with cognitive linguistics, while the second can be described as cross-linguistic corpus linguistics. The cognitive approach to phraseology across languages lays stress on metaphors and images as the constituent principles of set phrases, and provides interesting information about the intriguing interplay between universal cognitive principles, culture and phraseology. Cross-linguistic studies based on corpora, on the other hand, offer a statistical analysis of the various categories of set phrases as well as a very reliable methodology. Cross-linguistic phraseology is closely linked to translation studies. A close collaboration between multilingual corpus <b>linguistics,</b> <b>contrastive</b> phraseology and natural language processing may offer insightful perspectives on translation practice...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary Contrastive Studies of Polish, Bulgarian and Russian Neologisms versus Language Corpora In {{the field}} of Slavonic <b>linguistics</b> <b>contrastive</b> studies of neologisms occupy little place, the newest words are insufficiently {{described}} and classified. The aim {{of this article is}} to draw attention to the need for contrastive description of the newest lexis and checking exclusively one of many possibilities of obtaining Polish, Bulgarian and Russian neologisms. Language corpora, as this possibility is in question, are not the only source from which the author obtains her research material, yet a growing interest in corpora has inspired her to also use this method. The author wants to show the reader to what degree language corpora can help in building the thesaurus of Polish, Bulgarian and Russian neologisms. Making an attempt to confront a collection of neologisms of contemporary Polish, Bulgarian and Russian language, the author points out the need to standardize the description (identical for each of the analysed languages), which she intends to propose in another publications on neologisms in Polish, Bulgarian and Russian language. The application of contrastive method to three different but related languages from the Slavonic group will help, in her opinion, to discover more mechanisms of new words coming into existence and examine the newest derivative processes and their productivity...|$|R

40|$|Automatic text {{categorisation}} is a {{major challenge}} for information retrieval, information extraction, and semantic web projects. The categorisation of texts depends on the 'meaning' of the individual texts - texts sharing the same meaning should be categorised together and those with different meaning will be categorised separately. This is an intelligent task and requires the knowledge of a given domain and expertise in text categorisation. Meaning is expressed by using keywords in a specialist domain; these keywords can change over time and new keywords are added and old ones removed. I present a method where keywords are extracted automatically from large collection of texts and the keywords are then used to train neural computing systems - in a limited way the systems 'learn' to categorise. A number of different techniques of extracting keywords are presented. The keywords were extracted using the traditional tfidf metric, a technique used in <b>contrastive</b> corpus <b>linguistics</b> - weirdness; multi-word compounds {{have been used as}} well as vectors for text collections. For 'learning' algorithms, we used the unsupervised self-organising maps and the supervised support vector machines - both have been used for the purposes of dimension reduction that is mapping from a highdimensional feature space to a lower dimensional without much loss of accuracy. The performance of such systems is evaluated through classification accuracy and average quantisation error. Three large text collections were used for training and testing - the TREC-AP news wire, the Reuters RCV 1 and streaming news from Reuters Financial - the focus of the experimentation was on financial news. An archetype was developed that incorporates text analysis, terminology management, neural computing and feature vector generation systems. A novel evaluation scheme is reported where a vector of randomly selected words from a text collection is used as a baseline. The other comparisons are between systems trained by different techniques and with different learning algorithms. The key results include the classification accuracy is highest when the compound terms are chosen for creating vectors - the compounds were extracted automatically - however, when a terminology-based method was used to create vectors the single words from this method appear to be a better vector for training. The results of the experiments are encouraging. With further research, improvements in quantitative performance can be expected in the future...|$|R
40|$|This study {{involved}} {{the analysis of}} a corpus of health brochures in Spanish, contrasting the way this particular genre is formed and understood in the United States and Mexico. The corpus {{is made up of}} two subcorpora: a collection of health brochures published in the United States (translated from English into Spanish), and a collection of brochures from Mexico (written originally in Spanish). These subcorpora were analyzed and compared from many different angles, providing a comprehensive view of how the texts are structured and organized. Analysis at the microlinguistic level, grounded in Speech Act Theory, shows differences in the linguistic realization of the persuasive interactional goals in the two text types. At the macrolinguistic level, a factor analysis reveals differences between the two text types in terms of the patterning and co-occurrence of linguistic features serving the overall informational and persuasive functions characteristic of the health brochure. These differences are attributed to the interpersonal relations and cultural and social contexts in which the two text types are embedded. A subset of texts from both subcorpora was field tested with the aim of assessing the impact of the two text types on readers, in addition to readers' perceptions of the texts. Fifty-four Spanish-speaking adults from Mexico participated {{in this part of the}} study. Field testing involved a three pronged approach: a pretest-posttest protocol, recall protocol, and interviews. Responses provide a look at the brochures from the perspective of the reader, and shed light on the role of the two text types in the Mexican community.

40|$|This {{project is}} built on a {{definition}} of interculturality rooted in discourse, in line with recent research on interaction in specific fields. The spread of English, which frequently furthers exchange and contact between nations, also raises the crucial issue of the non-neutrality of language. From single phrases to generic patterns, linguistic constructs encode a culture-bound world view. Language is approached here as inseparable from a given sociocultural configuration - not merely consistent with it but deeply involved in its construction of reality and its representations. Text and discourse are where culture is built but also distorted, rejected or ignored. The {{focus will be on}} intercultural communication as it unfolds in the language of law, business communication, politics, diplomacy, research institutions and EU institutions. Intercultural communication affects the strategies whereby discourse is negotiated in texts for specific purposes, where social practices are shaped by the cultural diversity of actors and by a strong need for intercultural communication, and such practices are relevant to the field concerned and to English as a language subject to different (and at times contrasting) pressures. The first phase of the programme will be devoted to the construction of representative corpora in each of the fields targeted by the local research units. Such corpora will be drawn from paper and/or digital sources and will include recordings and videorecordings. In the second phase, each unit will analyse both electronically and manually the corpora in hand, for a multi-level analysis from micro- to macro-text, implementing corpus linguistic procedures and analytical tools provided by <b>contrastive</b> rhetoric, text <b>linguistics,</b> pragmatics, discourse analysis and sociolinguistics. Throughout the investigation process the units involved will operate in close connection with each other, so as to ensure uniformity in their methodological approach. Early results and final findings will be discussed nationally in meetings of the research units involved in the project, with the participation of Italian and foreign scholars. Finally, a CD-ROM database will be made available to the scientific community for further research as well as pedagogic purposes...|$|R
