This work investigates {{the impact of these}} channels on private investment, considering also the particular effect of the formal commitment to reform, which necessarily comes along with conditionality. Taking into account the selection problem posed by participation in World Bank programs, the results indicate that backed commitments are associated with lower investment ratios in the short-run, and none of the other potential channels of influence seem to counterbalance this negative impact.

40|$|We analyze how the {{altruism}} of {{an international}} financial institution (IFI) towards its lowincome member countries (LICs) alters the effectiveness of its loans. We study IFI loans to a credit-constrained LIC. The IFI''s repayment policy {{is determined by the}} interplay of its concerns for the welfare of the loan recipient and its fiduciary responsibilities to creditor countries. If the IFI is unable to commit to repayment terms in advance, <b>conditional</b> <b>loans</b> are superior to unconditional loans. Thus, IFI altruism and the inability to commit are sufficient reasons to equip <b>loans</b> with conditions. <b>Conditional</b> <b>loans</b> produce an efficient allocation of resources, so altruism is not a fundamental reason that loans fail to increase welfare.

40|$|An 'incentive subsidy' {{policy for}} subsidizing private R & D is {{proposed}} {{that can be}} more efficient, from a social point of view, than subsidy policies in common use such as a 'normal' subsidy policy (fixed amount granted at project start), and <b>conditional</b> <b>loans</b> (loan is repaid only if project is profitable). The incentive subsidy compensates firms for any private loss and taxes away any gain in addition the firm receives {{a small fraction of}} the resulting invention' s social value. This mechanism comes close to being perfectly incentive compatible. The firm chooses itself whether it wants to be covered under the incentive subsidy. Generally, the firm's choice coincides with three social aims: First, a project that the firm would conduct in any case should not be subsidized. Second, a project should not be subsidized if its social value is negative. Third, the subsidy should provide an incentive to maximize a project's social value. Using a simulation over a range of hypothetical research projects it is shown that the efficiency of <b>conditional</b> <b>loans</b> and normal grants declines drastically as the government's information about project parameters becomes poorer, while the incentive subsidy performs consistently well...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{fiscal policy}} without commitment {{and the effects}} of <b>conditional</b> bailout <b>loans.</b> The government relies on distortionary taxation and decides between full debt repayment and costly default. It tends to overborrow due to myopia, which induces default to be a relevant policy option and provides a rationale to constrain sovereign borrowing. We consider a lump-sum financed fund that offers loans at a favorable price and conditional upon minimum primary surpluses. While the government prefers defaulting in the most adverse states, we find that it is willing to accept <b>conditional</b> <b>loans</b> in close-to-default states. These bailouts can lead to an increase in the mean debt price and a lower default probability that are associated with enhanced household welfare. Yet, these outcomes can be reversed when bailouts are too generous, while public debt never decreases in the long-run when bailout loans are available...|$|R

The IMF will often provide various <b>conditional</b> <b>loans</b> to post-conflict countries {{in order to}} mitigate {{the effects of the}} economic crises that are so common in that context. Additionally, in 1995 the IMF established the Emergency Assistance program, which is specifically targeted to post-conflict countries.

In post-conflict countries, most IMF programs, and a quarter to a third of the World Bank’s programs, come in the form of structural adjustment plans (SAPs). Structural adjustment <b>loans</b> are <b>conditional</b> <b>loans</b> geared to the reform of economic policies, collectively called SAPs, in the recipient country, generally through widespread economic liberalization.

40|$|Extending {{financial}} services to unbanked population in India {{has remained a}} central part of the policy thrust of the Indian government for decades. To that effect, a widespread formal credit delivery mechanism has been established to meet the credit requirements of rural communities. However, the Indian government-backed formal financial sector has had limited success in providing resources to poor rural households, which has led to strong criticism of the policy and its implementation. In this study, we use data from 600 rural households spread across six Indian states to examine the changing distribution of credit off-take among borrowers of formal financial institutions. By using quantile regression, we find that even among rural households that could access loans from the formal banking sector, the distribution of credit off-take is skewed towards resource-rich households. We also find that even among borrowers in the upper quantiles of the <b>conditional</b> <b>loan</b> distribution, marginal farmers received substantially less loan amounts than those belonging to the category of medium and large farmers...|$|E

40|$|Government {{measures}} for promoting innovation in industry Technology and innovation {{play a major}} role in wealth creation and economic growth. Governments in all OECD countries have put in place various mechanisms aimed at providing public support for firms, including the provision of public funds, incentives, investment support, technical services and scientific and technological infrastructure. Identifying and measuring the impact of public support to industry is a difficult task. Recent OECD studies analyse transfers to industrial firms which are categorised in two groups: the first consisting of money transfers (for R&D and innovation contracts, and for procurement of innovated products and processes); the second of financial incentives (regular grants, reimbursable grants, interest rate subsidies, regular <b>loans,</b> <b>conditional</b> <b>loans,</b> guarantees, equity capital, tax concessions, mixed financial incentives) (OECD, 1997).

Direct support measures involve the direct transfer of financial means such as grants, subsidies or <b>conditional</b> <b>loans,</b> but also non-financial support, e. g., access to information and advice, brokerage schemes, or funding for networks. The distinctive feature of direct support is that specific measures are targeted at specifically defined projects. Support depends on a commission's discretionary case-by-case decision governed by pre-specified funding criteria and selection rules.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{publicly}} funded support of technology-based ventures. These ventures {{are regarded as}} solutions to create growth and societal development. They are commonly originated from universities, institutes or other firms and their products or techniques are commonly new or at least different from the ordinary. They are therefore considered as being of higher risk than generic new firms, but if successful they may also give higher returns. Hence, a range of efforts has been undertaken to support them. However, concerning the issue of public support, gaps of research have been exposed. This thesis aims to give some answers {{on the question of}} what characterizes the public support given to technology-based ventures in Sweden. It elucidates two types of public support, the “configuration-type” and the “process-type” The first is studied by using statistical databases built upon the <b>conditional</b> <b>loans</b> and the innovation subsidies that were offered by Sweden Innovation Centre during the years 1994 - 2003. The second type concerns incubator support, and investigates how best practise incubators can be evaluated. Among the results, it can be mentioned that different support actors use different selection criteria depending on their goals, however the credibility of the applying venture is crucial for approval. Furthermore, a framework for best practice evaluation is developed. Report code: LiU-Tek-Lic 2005 : 72.

40|$|This study aims {{to assess}} the {{importance}} of conditionality in the adoption of adjustment policies {{in a group of}} South-East Asian economies. For this purpose,conditionality is taken as referring to the changes in the economic policy that international financial institutions (IFIs) require of national governments in the course of adjustment. The study will concentrate mainly on the policy-related lending provided by the World Bank; wherever pertinent, IMF conditionality will also be investigated. The countries covered are South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. These countries are seldom thought of as 'adjusting', but in fact most of them have been extremely successful adjusters. The Philippines, as the exception in the group, illustrates the case of a country which, having been the recipient of highly <b>conditional</b> <b>loans</b> from outside agencies, failed to achieve complete success in its economic adjustment. There are therefore some relevant questions to be asked. Did outside agencies affect the policies adopted? Did they do so through conditionality or by means of influence, persuasion, financial support, etc. ? What degree of responsibility should be attached to external institutions? Was the conditionality too harsh or too weak? The study is divided into two periods.

40|$|State {{subsidies}} to R & D or innovative investments in firms are organized {{in many different}} ways. Examples from the plethora of extant subsidy instruments are tax incentives, grants to researchers, project grants, <b>loans,</b> <b>conditional</b> <b>loans,</b> and grants with royalty rights. Very little is currently known {{about the effectiveness of}} these subsidy forms. In this paper we compare the effectiveness of eight forms of subsidy for R & D projects. The comparison is based on a survey of Swedish R & D managers, including detailed information about 214 research projects or project proposals. In a first set of results we report managers' general judgments about the effectiveness of different subsidy forms. Second, R & D managers were asked to judge how each subsidy instrument would affect the firm's decision about the size of each project and whether to conduct it. This allows an estimate of how much additional R & D each policy might induce. There are two main conclusions. First, general subsidies do not seem to induce much additional R & D for a given amount of subsidy. Second, among specific subsidies so called 'stock option grants' seem to induce most R, D per subsidy krona. These are grants that give the state a right to recoup some of its funding by exercising a stock option if the firm's value rises rapidly. The main reason that the stock option grant performs well is not that the state can recoup some of its costs hut rather that firms do not accept this subsidy for much of the research that they would have conducted even without subsidy...|$|R

This article examines that question in detail and finds that the postdefault foreclosure experience of minorities is very similar to that of nonminorities, and that lenders tend to give minorities more (rather than less) time to work out their situation before commencing foreclosure. These findings are robust across a number of dimensions, nullifying the above-mentioned critiques of BCGH.

40|$|Approximately sixty {{countries}} have been designated `Fragile States 2 ̆ 7 by international development agencies. Home to two billion of the world 2 ̆ 7 s poorest people, these fragile states are characterized by violence, weak institutions and shattered economies. Not only do they pose a challenge to regional security, they often become the breeding grounds for terrorism. Donor agencies pour billions of dollars annually into these countries - through policy advice and <b>conditional</b> <b>loans</b> - to alleviate fragility and promote development. Development, however it is defined, involves economic, social and political transformation. Such a transformation is shaped by ideas, engages multiple interests, and proceeds within rules and norms set by political institutions. Since the structure of political institutions is influenced by human agency, leadership becomes important to study. Leadership is crucial particularly in fragile states, where institutions are weak or have been destroyed by conflict; however, a systematic effort to examine the role of leaders and coalitions in fragile states is lacking. This dissertation seeks to create a methodology to improve {{understanding of the role}} of different leadership strategies in bringing about transitions in and out of fragility. To make the scope manageable, the study focuses on: (i) leadership at the national level; and (ii) fragile states in Africa. It does so by examining: (i) evidence from country level panel data on leadership (regime) change and fragility; and (ii) in-depth analytical case studies of transitions in and out of fragility in four countries: Zimbabwe, Uganda, Rwanda, and South Africa. The analysis looks at the relationship between the change agent 2 ̆ 7 s leadership strategy (the independent variable: political participation and inclusion, economic growth and inclusion, and security and justice) and fragility outcomes (dependent variable: conflict and security indicators, economic indicators, and the approach to political inclusion). The results of the regression analysis exhibit a robust association between leadership change and fragility. Furthermore, the country cases show how different types of leadership strategies lead to varying trajectories of fragile states 2 ̆ 7 post-transition. The case studies reveal different approaches to sequencing of political inclusion and the role of leadership exit in transitions from fragility...|$|R
