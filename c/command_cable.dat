Task Group Rake, a Royal New Zealand Engineers group, joined Multi-National Division South East for one year under British Army <b>command.</b> <b>Cables</b> leaked by Wikileaks in 2010 suggested New Zealand had only done {{so in order to}} keep valuable Oil for Food contracts.|$|R
50|$|Goliaths {{were used}} {{on all fronts}} where the Wehrmacht fought, {{beginning}} in early 1942. They were used principally by specialized Panzer and combat engineer units. Goliaths were used at Anzio in Italy in April 1944, and against the Polish resistance during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. A few Goliaths were also seen on the beaches of Normandy during D-Day, though most were rendered inoperative due to artillery blasts severing their <b>command</b> <b>cables.</b> Allied troops also encountered {{a small number of}} Goliaths in the Maritime Alps following the landings in southern France in August 1944, with at least one being used successfully against a vehicle of the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shan't {{marry her}} just yet," [...] whispered Paul, seeing {{his plans for}} the time frustrated. Gazing in audacious tranquillity upon the decks of the enemy, and {{amicably}} answering her hail, with complete self-possession, he <b>commanded</b> the <b>cable</b> to be slipped, and then, as if he had accidentally parted his anchor, turned his prow on the seaward tack, meaning to return again immediately with the same prospect of advantage possessed at first--his plan being to crash suddenly athwart the Drake's bow, so as to have all her decks exposed point-blank to his musketry. But once more the winds interposed. It came on with a storm of snow; he was obliged to give up his project.|$|R
50|$|On 12 October, Outsrip contested Britain's {{most prestigious}} two-year-old race, the Group One Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket. He started the 15/8 second {{favourite}} behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained War Command. Barzalona settled the colt behind the leaders {{but was unable}} to make significant progress in the closing stages and finished third behind War <b>Command</b> and <b>Cable</b> Bay. On his final appearance of the season, Outstrip was sent to California to contest the Grade I Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf over one mile at Santa Anita Park. Ridden by the American veteran Mike Smith (Barzalona was committed to ride for Godolphin in Japan) he came from well off the pace to win from Giovanni Boldini and Bobby's Kitten.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the morning}} of 19 February the ship arrived at Tanjong Priok where her {{commanding}} officer, Lieutenant Commander T. Christy, RANR(S), reported to Commodore Collins and received orders to take temporary command of [...] and, with a party of Royal Air Force personnel return in Ballarat to Oosthaven for salvage of air force material. With that mission accomplished Christy returned in Ballarat on 21 February, the date when the American-British-Dutch-Australian <b>Command</b> had <b>cabled</b> Winston Churchill that further efforts to hold Java {{and the purpose of}} the command itself were useless. Withdrawal from Java began and on 22 February Ballarat, Bendigo, Burnie and Maryborough replaced coal burning ships in the Sunda Strait Auxiliary Patrol established by Collins to prevent Japanese landings on Java from Sumatra with night crossings in small craft.|$|R
30|$|The PWE-E has two {{independent}} CPU boards (CPU# 8 and CPU# 9). The data from EWO-EFD, EWO-WFC/OFA(E), and HFA {{are sent to}} CPU# 8 and {{the data from the}} EWO-OFA/WFC(B) are sent to CPU# 9 using spacewire <b>cables.</b> <b>Commands</b> to the receivers and sensors are sent from these CPU boards, and housekeeping and mission data of the PWE are sent to the CPU boards. The onboard software running on these CPU boards provides the FFT calculation function for the OFA and the data compression for the WFC (Matsuda et al. 2018).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{maintenance}} works (e. g. inspection, repair) of aero-engines while still attached on the airframes requires a desirable approach since this can significantly shorten both {{the time and}} cost of such interventions as the aerospace industry commonly operates based on the generic concept “power by the hour”. However, navigating and performing a multi-axis movement of an end-effector in a very constrained environment such as gas turbine engines is a challenging task. This paper reports {{on the development of}} a highly flexible slender (i. e. low diameter-to-length ratios) continuum robot of 25 degrees of freedom capable to uncoil from a drum to provide the feeding motion needed to navigate into crammed environments and then perform, with its last 6 DoF, complex trajectories with a camera equipped machining end-effector for allowing in-situ interventions at a low-pressure compressor of a gas turbine engine. This continuum robot is a compact system and presents a set of innovative mechatronics solutions such as: (i) twin <b>commanding</b> <b>cables</b> to minimise the number of actuators; (ii) twin compliant joints to enable large bending angles (± 90 °) arranged on a tapered structure (start from 40 mm to 13 mm at its end); (iii) feeding motion provided by a rotating drum for coiling/uncoiling the continuum robot; (iv) machining end-effector equipped with vision system. To be able to achieve the in-situ maintenance tasks, a set of innovative control algorithms to enable the navigation and end-effector path generation have been developed and implemented. Finally, the continuum robot has been tested both for navigation and movement of the end-effector against a specified target within a gas turbine engine mock-up proving that: (i) max. deviations in navigation from the desired path (1000 mm length with bends between 45 ° and 90 °) are ± 10 mm; (ii) max. errors in positioning the end-effector against a target situated at the end of navigation path is 1 mm. Thus, this paper presents a compact continuum robot that could be considered as a step forward in providing aero-engine manufacturers with a solution to perform complex tasks in an invasive manner...|$|R
50|$|In 2005, Sealevel Systems {{released}} the industry’s first RoHS-compliant serial I/O board. In 2008, Sealevel won a defense contract for a USB/serial port cable with a heavily encased circuit board. The cable allows {{soldiers in the}} field to link laptops to AN/PRC-117F Multiband Manpack Radio (MBMMR) tactical radios, manufactured by any company, and transmit data, including GPS maps, images, coordinates and IM-type communications via radio signal instead of by satellite. It took seven years for the company to perfect the technology. In 2013 the company was awarded a sole-source contract for Naval Air Systems <b>Command</b> for this <b>cable.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Spanish {{were using}} undersea cables {{as a means}} to {{communicate}} with not only the rest of Cuba, but also the Spanish <b>command.</b> These <b>cables</b> had many key junctions, namely, a shore near Cienfuegos. The cables connected to Havana, the port of Santiago, and then branched off to other Caribbean islands such as Jamaica. The cables were run out from an easily located house which contained a critical hub for the undersea cable system. While the house could easily be destroyed, this would only inflict largely superficial damage, and could easily be repaired and functioning {{in a short period of}} time. Therefore, command decided to grapple the three cables out of the sea and cut them in several places, disrupting much of the communications between the Spanish and their operations in Cuba. This damage would be much more difficult to repair, as the cables were nearing two inches in diameter which made cutting, and by extension repairing them, a difficult task. For the mission, the cruiser USS Marblehead, the gunboat USS Nashville, and the revenue cutter USS Windom were dispatched under the command of Captain Bowman H. McCalla to sever them.|$|R
40|$|Almost all the Industrial Data Acquisition {{and control}} systems today use {{connection}} oriented concepts for interfaces. However, various shapes and functional <b>commands</b> that each <b>cable</b> or wire based system has also raises numerous problems: {{the difficulties in}} locating the particular area affected by the industrial parameter, the complexity in operation of the system, the maintenance issue and so on. The control of sensitive industrial parameters by using SCADAbased wireless technology has gained significant industry and academic attention lately for the usability benefits and convenience that it offers users. The control of the temperature of a room containing chemicals and toxic gases the existing research has failed to provide a flexible solution for controlling such conditions by connection- oriented systems. They have used cables and bulky equipment which require large amount of space, high degree of the maintenance and are easily detoriated by moisture and excessive heat. Additionally, the Data acquisition and control techniques used so far have imposed considerable computational burden and have not provided a consistent and accurate results expected by the employees and their industries...|$|R
2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the battle, Sampson’s flagship the New York approached the Brooklyn. [...] Schley sent the message by signal flag: “The enemy has surrendered” and “We have gained a great victory.” Against common practice {{at the end of a}} victorious battle, Sampson did not respond with the expected congratulatory remark, but rather, according to historian Joseph G. Dawson, [...] "the answering signal was terse and seemed needlessly brusque." [...] After these messages were exchanged, more tension grew between the two officers when Schley requested that he and his crew should [...] "have the honor of the surrender of the Cristobal Colon." [...] With disregard to Schley and the other <b>commanding</b> officers, Sampson <b>cabled</b> Secretary Long, [...] "The fleet under my command offers the nation as a Fourth of July present the whole of Cevera’s fleet," [...] invoking General William T. Sherman's message to Abraham Lincoln after taking Atlanta in 1864, but making no reference to Schley. A day after the news reached the United States, the New York Times published an article with the headline, [...] "Sampson's Fourth of July Victory," [...] expressing gratitude towards Sampson for his leadership during the Battle of Santiago. In Sampson's hometown of Palmyra, New York, a respectful one hundred shots were fired for his victory. Following the newspaper headlines were interviews and telegraphs from Sampson's wife, sister, and two sons. Each message displayed praise and congratulations for his accomplishments in the battle.|$|R
