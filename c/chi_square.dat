If a <b>chi</b> <b>squared</b> test is conducted on a sample {{with a smaller}} size, then the <b>chi</b> <b>squared</b> test will yield an inaccurate inference.

25|$|A random {{variable}} {{that is a}} function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter, but whose probability distribution does not depend on the unknown parameter is called a pivotal quantity or pivot.

25|$|Benford's law was empirically tested {{against the}} numbers (up to the 10th digit) {{generated}} {{by a number of}} important distributions, including the uniform distribution, the exponential distribution, the half-normal distribution, the right-truncated normal, the normal distribution, the <b>chi</b> <b>square</b> distribution and the log normal distribution. In addition to these the ratio distribution of two uniform distributions, the ratio distribution of two exponential distributions, the ratio distribution of two half-normal distributions, the ratio distribution of two right-truncated normal distributions, the ratio distribution of two chi-square distributions (the F distribution) and the log normal distribution were tested.|$|E
25|$|The uniform {{distribution}} {{as might be}} expected does not obey Benford's law. In contrast, the ratio distribution of two {{uniform distribution}}s is well described by Benford's law. Benford's law also describes the exponential distribution and the ratio distribution of two exponential distributions well. Although the half-normal distribution does not obey Benford's law, the ratio distribution of two half-normal distributions does. Neither the right-truncated normal distribution nor the ratio distribution of two right-truncated normal distributions are well described by Benford's law. This is not surprising as this distribution is weighted towards larger numbers. Neither the normal distribution nor the ratio distribution of two normal distributions (the Cauchy distribution) obey Benford's law. The fit of <b>chi</b> <b>square</b> distribution depends on the degrees of freedom (df) with good agreement with df = 1 and decreasing agreement as the df increases. The F distribution is fitted well for low degrees of freedom. With increasing dfs the fit decreases but much more slowly than the <b>chi</b> <b>square</b> distribution. The fit of the log-normal distribution depends on the mean and the variance of the distribution. The variance has a much greater effect on the fit than does the mean. Larger values of both parameters result in better agreement with the law. The ratio of two log normal distributions is a log normal so this distribution was not examined.|$|E
