These services, known as Community Dotcoms, are available nationwide and include furniture donation, scrap car <b>collection,</b> <b>skip</b> hire, and bulky waste collection.Bookings are made on centralised online systems {{and sent to the}} most appropriate collection partner in the local area. The strategy for Community Dotcoms is to prioritise collection partners that are registered charities, offering them long-term support in becoming self-sufficient.|$|E
40|$|Human {{activities}} create wastes. Whether wastes {{would pose}} {{risks to the}} environment and to public health depend on how they are handled, stored, collected and disposed off. The research sought to identify the approaches adopted by households to dispose off wastes; the perception of households on public health in relation to nearness to dumpsites; health related activities organized and challenges of managing wastes. Duase, Ohwim and Oti-Dompoase, all in Kumasi metropolis were studied to understand these issues. A total of 256 households were systematically sampled from 3, 364 households at a 95 % confidence level. It was found that 44. 9 % of the household respondents disposed off their wastes at the dumpsites within their respective residential areas; 26. 9 % at the central <b>collection</b> <b>skip</b> containers provided by KMA; 17. 2 %, in pits at their backyards; and 10. 9 % by burning. ZoomLion Ghana Ltd, ABC Waste Group, Meskworld Co. Ltd and Kumasi Waste Management Limited were responsible for managing waste within the study areas. Their operations however seem not satisfactory by the respondents. About 41. 4 % of the household respondents complained of the stench of the dumpsites which some of them even attributed it to the cause of numerous diseases in the communities such as catarrh, cough and chest pains. Diarrhea, intestinal worms, typhoid fever and cancer were perceived as diseases resulting from the wastes at the dumpsites. About 41. 4 % cited stench of the dumpsites to justify this claim while others link the poor management of waste to the causes of numerous diseases (catarrh, cough and chest pains, diarrhea, intestinal worms, typhoid fever and cancer) prevalent in the communities. The operations of the waste management companies were however found to be challenged by inadequate trucks and equipment, high operating cost, limited land availability for sanitary landfill and inadequate funding. Community participation in sanitation improvement programmes, separation of solid wastes at collection points, recycling of solid wastes and sensitization on how to dispose off waste and how to prevent waste related diseases have been recommended...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A meta-search engine propagates user queries to its {{participant}} {{search engines}} following a server selection strategy. To facilitate server selection, the meta-search engine must keep concise descriptors about the document collections indexed by the participant search engines. Most existing approaches {{record in the}} descriptors information about what terms appear in a document <b>collection,</b> but they <b>skip</b> information about which documents a keyword appears in. This results in ineffective server ranking for multi-term queries, because a document collection may contain all of the query terms {{but not all of}} the terms appear in the same document. In this paper, we propose a server ranking approach in which each search engine’s document collection is divided into clusters by indexed terms. Furthermore, we keep the term correlation information in a cluster descriptor as a concise method to estimate the degree of term co-occurrence in a document set. We empirically show that combining clustering and term correlation analysis significantly improves search precision and that our approach effectively identifies the most relevant servers even with a naïve clustering method and a small number of clusters. ...|$|R
40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} refers to waste in a solid form, {{produced}} in the daily day life of a society such as packaging, food scrapes, grass clippings, clothing, furniture, paper, electronics and so on. It is called municipal solid waste because {{it is in the}} responsibility of the local government and comes from our homes, schools, hospitals and businesses. It is produced 108 tons municipal solid waste in Iringa each day. Iringa district is located approximately 500 km from Dar Es Salaam and 263 km from Tanzania’s capital Dodoma. Iringa Municipality (IMP) is headquarter of Iringa district, which has an assumed population of 166 237 people. Iringa Municipality have 169 waste collection points, 56 of them are served with skip buckets. Most household waste is disposed of in people’s own back yard and unofficial dumpsites are mostly seen in poor areas with huge lack of served <b>collection</b> points. The <b>skip</b> buckets are transported to the land filling where the waste is compressed and occasionally burned. The 15 acres land filling is located 7 km outside of the city center, close to households in a highly populated area. It is one watchman in charge of the land filling, and he has no particular knowledge about waste management. 22 - 25 tons of solid waste is disposed of at the land filling each day, this is 20 % of the waste produced. As much as 75 - 80 percent is organic waste, but the most revealing problem is all the disposable plastic bags that can be seen everywhere in the nature. Few options for recycling exist, and open dumping with open burning is the norm. The research has addressed some problems and challenges connected to the current situation that has been chosen as focus areas in this project. The most noticeable ones are: - harmful disposal of waste through burning and burying - lack of knowledge about waste management - poorly managed collection points and land filling - lack of existing systems for recycling - cost inefficient management To approach these areas, four concepts have been chosen for further development: - a new concept for the waste collection points with stations for separation of garbage. - the design of bags from recycled waste to substitute disposable plastic bags. - a ICT system with the intention to educate and inform about waste management and to ease the communication between the users, the workers and the management in the new service. - strategies on how the establishment of CBO’ s can benefit the privatizing of the SWM and how they can contribute to solve the problems addressed in the current situation. The research question for the thesis is focused on the design process of the four concepts: “How can a design approach have effect in a project for solid waste management in Tanzania?” The process has been multi-disciplinary and the approach has been human centered with the aim of making a strategy for the privatizing of the solid waste business that does not exclude anyone in the society. The research tools have been supplemented with the use of some specific design tools. To answer the research question, the effect of those tools has been discussed in the conclusion. The motivation for this project have been to “improve the life of the 166 000 citizens of Iringa, and design a new system that can be adapted to other places in East-Afric...|$|R
