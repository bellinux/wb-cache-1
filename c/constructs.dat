5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These <b>constructs</b> only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such <b>constructs</b> permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E

5|$|Instead {{of solving}} {{for the two}} hyperbolas, Newton <b>constructs</b> their {{directrix}} lines instead. For any hyperbola, the ratio of distances from a point Z to a focus A and to the directrix is a fixed constant called the eccentricity. The two directrices intersect at a point T, and from their two known distance ratios, Newton <b>constructs</b> a line passing through T on which Z must lie. However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a circle {{can be defined as}} the set of points that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this definition is the basis of bipolar coordinates.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.|$|E

50|$|Delayed Clause Construction is a {{stalling}} {{strategy that}} enhances a theorem prover's performance {{by reducing the}} work to <b>construct</b> clauses to a minimum. Instead of <b>constructing</b> every conclusion (clause) of an applied inference rule, the information to <b>construct</b> such clause is temporarily stored until the theorem prover decides to either discard the clause or <b>construct</b> it. If the theorem prover decides to keep the clause, it will be <b>constructed</b> and stored in memory, otherwise the information to <b>construct</b> the clause is erased. Storing the information from which an inferred clause can be <b>constructed</b> require almost no additional CPU operations. However, <b>constructing</b> a clause may consume a lot of time.

5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} <b>constructs</b> similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology.

With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient attention has been paid to the highly speculative nature of his theological <b>constructs</b> and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus.
