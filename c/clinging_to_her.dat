5|$|The repentant Carl goes outside, {{only to see}} Russell sailing {{off with}} some {{balloons}} and the propulsive leaf blower to try to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to lighten the house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddles Alpha with his cone of shame and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping Dug, Kevin and Russell inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with Dug and Russell <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> back. Muntz leaps after them, but snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.|$|E
25|$|Ajax the Lesser raped Cassandra on Athena's altar {{while she}} was <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> statue. Because of Ajax's impiety, the Acheaens, urged by Odysseus, wanted to stone him to death, but he fled to Athena's altar, and was spared.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the women}} of the royal family, Locrian Ajax {{violated}} Cassandra on Athena's altar while she was <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> statue, which since looks upward. She was awarded to Agamemnon. Neoptolemus got Andromache, wife of Hector and Odysseus took Priam's widow Hecuba (known in Greek as Hecabe). The ghost of Achilles appeared before the survivors of the war, demanding that the Trojan princess Polyxena be sacrificed before anybody could leave, as either part of his spoil or because she had betrayed him. Neoptolemus did so.|$|E

25|$|Others mate in December with a {{gestation}} period {{of four to}} five months, and give birth in April or May. Mothers {{give birth to a}} single pup in a litter. Mothers take care of the young after birth; the males take no part in raising it. The pup clings to its mother's abdomen during flight and when perched. The young will remain with the mother, <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> chest wherever she goes, until it is able to fly. The mother nurses the young during this time. The young drink their mother's milk until they are weaned onto their adult diet of insects. The time spent with the mother allows the young to observe hunting behavior as well as learn other skills necessary for survival as an adult. Once the young bat is able to fly, it can forage for itself. It may stay with the mother's colony or find another when it is grown.|$|E
500|$|Putana (also {{called as}} poothani), the [...] "killer of infants", {{was sent by}} Krishna's evil uncle Kamsa to kill Krishna. Putana assumed the {{disguise}} of a young, beautiful woman and came to Gokul (Vraj) - Krishna's home-town. Her beauty resulted in her being mistaken by gopas (cowherds) {{as a manifestation of}} goddess Lakshmi. Stunned by her beauty, Krishna's foster-mother Yashoda allowed Putana to take the infant Krishna into her lap and breast-feed him. Putana had smeared her breast with a mandana, an intoxicant, to kill Krishna. [...] However, Krishna squeezed her breasts and took her life away(prana), as well as her milk. (Putana had got blessing [...] in her previous life from Lord Vishnu that she will meet lord Vishnu's avtaar in human form in her next life but she forgot about it). In pain, Putana screamed, pleading for her release, but in vain. She ran out of the town with Krishna still <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and finally fell dead. [...] She then assumed her real demonic form, turning trees to a distance of three gavyuti (a unit of distance equivalent totally to 12 miles) to dust. The people of Vraj cut Putana's body, burying her bones and feet and burning the flesh and skin. The fragrant smoke rose out of the flames, as Putana was cleansed of all sin by breast-feeding Krishna and she attained the same heaven that Yashoda acquired. Thus, Putana, like Yashodha, is also considered as a foster-mother of Krishna as she breast-fed him.|$|E
2500|$|... is a young, {{beautiful}} swordswoman who wields a black katana. She {{has a large}} X-shaped scar on her chest, {{a remnant}} of events years ago in which she and her parents were slashed down by an unknown assailant. <b>Clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> life, the trauma of watching her parents brutally murdered {{in front of her}} eyes has left her amnesic. That same night, she is taken in, raised and trained by the swordsman Fuyumine, whom she believed murdered her parents. Because of her amnesia, she was given the name [...] "Naoto" [...] and would train with Fuyumine for years. After Naoto finds that Magato, another pupil [...] "senior" [...] to Naoto, has killed Fuyumine, she learns that Fuyumine is not the one who killed her parents, and that the real murderer is a [...] "Naoto from below". Realizing her mistake, she would come to acknowledge her mentor as a father figure from then on, and in his honor would take his name into her own, as Naoto Fuyumine, along with inheriting his coat and black katana. She then begins a search for the [...] "original Naoto" [...] to exact revenge for her parents and teacher, which leads to her meeting with Heine, Badou, and Mihai.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Tohru's {{feelings}} for Kyo develop and she eventually admits {{he is the}} Sohma she wants the most to free, because she loves him. This, however, only distresses her further, as she feels she is being unfaithful to her mother's memory. However, when Tohru finally confesses to Kyo, he tells her he knew her mother {{when he was a}} child, and that he could have saved Kyoko from the car that killed her except it would have revealed his curse and Kyoko's final word [...] "I won't forgive you!" [...] (Later it is understood that she meant to say [...] "I won't forgive you if you don't take care of Tohru!") But Tohru doesn't believe her mother would say that but if she did she would have to go against it because she loves him. Unable in his guilt to accept Tohru's feelings, he says her love is an illusion and runs away. As she follows him, she meets Akito, who believes that Tohru's kindness to and acceptance of the cursed zodiac members has made them unfaithful to her, weakening their [...] "bond" [...] to the point that Momiji and Hiro have been freed from the curse. As she angrily confronts her, however, Tohru realizes that she is trapped by the past as much as she herself has been, by <b>clinging</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother's memory, and she extends her hand in friendship to Akito and introduces herself as a new start. However, before Akito can accept, Tohru falls down a nearby cliff when the ground collapses in the rain. The accident makes Kyo realize how much he values Tohru, and also allows Akito to finally break away from the roles she has held for most of her life.|$|E
