40|$|Government regulations, {{whether they}} appear in {{statutes}} or administrative rules, often contain exemptions: certain persons or transactions are fully or partially excused from complying with the regulatory scheme. Even regulations without explicit exemptions may be worded {{in such a way}} as to implicitly exempt certain persons. A rule that applies to 2 ̆ 2 all green objects 2 ̆ 2 implicitly exempts objects of every other color? Economists and legal scholars have written dozens of analyses of the efficiency of various government regulations but, with a few exceptions, they have not paid much attention to exemptions from those regulatory requirements. The limited economic and legal literature on exemptions focuses on one particular type of exemption - the small business exemptions which appear in many U. S. statutes and regulations. The traditional assumption that an exemption is justified if the cost of regulating the exempted group exceeds the benefit is incorrect. The case <b>for</b> regulatory <b>exemptions</b> is more complicated. The traditional view provides only a necessary, not a sufficient, <b>condition</b> <b>for</b> <b>exemptions.</b> The transaction costs of exemptions, such as specification costs, strategic behavior, enforcement costs, and any third-part information costs, must also be considered.

40|$|Harmonization of tax {{systems of}} the European Union member states {{has been going on}} since 1950 s. This trend is {{followed}} to this day in order to achieve one of the primary objectives of the European Union, single domestic market. The harmonization of tax systems allows free movement of capital, goods, and services. Value added tax is harmonized through the EU Directives that have unified tax object, tax base and partly tax rates. The Court of Justice of the European Union also plays a vital role in the harmonization, because the European case law complements the interpretation of the directives and creates a comprehensive impact throughout the harmonization. This thesis analyses the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which have been implemented in the VAT Act, and examines at the same time impact of the implementation. The first implementation took place in the amendment of the VAT Act in 2006. The biggest changes occurred in the amendment of the VAT Act in 2012 and it was mainly {{in the realm of the}} <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> <b>exemption</b> from VAT without deduction and the possibility of claiming a deduction.

40|$|Under Belgian {{constitutional}} law, {{succession tax}} and registration tax are regional taxes. For the Flemish government, the legislative competence {{in this field}} seems an important instrument for policy making. In an attempt to sustain familial entrepreneurship as a valuable element in our society's economic texture, the inheritance of a family-owned company is exempted from the Succession Tax (art. 60 bis Succession Tax Code for the Flemish Region). It is useful to analyse this measure. More precisely, {{it is interesting to}} figure out the material <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the aforementioned <b>exemption</b> and policy-goals that inspired to them. Questions to be dealt with are the characteristics of a family-owned company - how must the company be organised; minimum control/participation of the deceased's family - and the minimum standards the company must fulfil in terms of - ongoing - employment. For transfer by death, an <b>exemption</b> exists; while <b>for</b> the gift of a company inters vivo, a reduced tax rate is applied (art. 140 bis-octies Registration Tax Code for the Flemish Region). The <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> this reduction need to be analysed, as well as the differences with the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> the <b>exemption</b> of art. 60 bis Succession Tax Code for the Flemish Region shall be commented. It has to be clear why the reduction of the percentage of the Registration Tax is not reserved to family-owned companies and why {{it does not seem to}} be subject to an employment condition, but only to keep the company ongoing during a period of five years. Lastly, the Flemish measures to promote entrepreneurship form the viewpoint of Succession tax and Registration tax need to be situated in an international and inter-regional context...|$|R
40|$|Employees' {{benefits}} from the income taxes point of view Employee benefit {{can be defined as}} a certain advantage given to the employee by his employer on top of his salary. It is a voluntary fulfillment of the employer to which he is not obliged according to any law. Benefits represent significant motivator for current employees as well as attraction for new applicants. Benefits can be provided either in monetary or non-monetary form. The form of the benefit is usually crucial for the determination of its tax treatment on both employer's and employee's side. On the employee's side it has to be determined whether the benefit is taxable or tax exempt. On the employer's side it has to be determined whether the relating costs are tax deductible or not. The Income Taxes Act states explicitly that certain non-monetary benefits are tax non- deductible (e. g. gifts, expenses in the form of possibility to use cultural, leisure, medical, educational or sports facilities). In other cases the tax deductibility may be limited (e. g. contributions to alimentation provided by third parties including meal vouchers). On the other hand, non-monetary form is often one of the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> tax <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> the employee (e. g. education, alimentation, soft drinks or possibility to use sports or medical facilities).

5000|$|Another {{group of}} retailers, called the Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes (RAVAS) {{have filed a}} {{complaint}} with the EU Directorate of Taxation, alleging that the UK Government has breached the Directive covering LVCR by failing to take action to stop abuse.

The retailers argue that by failing to stop abuse of LVCR the UK Government is in breach of the Principal VAT Directive (previously the Sixth VAT Directive) which states that the <b>conditions</b> <b>for</b> EU tax <b>exemptions</b> such as LVCR should be laid down [...] "for the purposes of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of those exemptions" [...] and to prevent any [...] "possible evasions, avoidance or abuse".|$|R

He was always the most unassuming person in any company, and at some large public dinners where I saw him I found him patient of the greater attention that more public men paid themselves and one another.
