25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to facilitate the}} use of biodiesel in cold conditions is by employing a second fuel tank for biodiesel {{in addition to the}} standard diesel fuel tank. The second fuel tank can be insulated and a heating <b>coil</b> using <b>engine</b> coolant is run through the tank. The fuel tanks can be switched over when the fuel is sufficiently warm. A similar method can be used to operate diesel vehicles using straight vegetable oil.|$|R
50|$|A {{low tension}} <b>coil</b> for <b>engine</b> {{ignition}} {{is used in}} conjunction with a battery and an ignitor. The ignitor {{is no more than a}} set of contacts that reside inside the combustion chamber of the engine. A series circuit is made between the three components: battery connects to coil, second terminal on the coil connects to the ignitor, second terminal on the ignitor (usually connected electrically and mechanically to the engine itself) connects to the second terminal of the battery.|$|R
40|$|Electromechanical valve {{actuators}} {{have been investigated}} in recent literature to implement variable valve timing (VVT) in spark ignition vehicle engines. Various types of electromechanical actuators are being investigated to control engine valves independently from crankshaft and ultimately get full benefits from variable valve timing. This thesis investigates {{a new type of}} electromechanical actuator - voice coil actuator (VCA). The thesis addresses the modeling of the voice <b>coil</b> actuated <b>engine</b> valve system and proposes a novel control strategy using pulse width modulation (PWM) that achieves fast transitions and low seating velocities. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis of a discrete-time model of the closed-loop PWM system as well as an experimental validation of the static force characteristics of the VCA are also presented in the thesi...|$|R
50|$|George Snell {{was born}} in Bradford, Massachusetts, the {{youngest}} of three children. His father (who {{was born in}} Minnesota), worked as a secretary for the local YMCA; he invented a device for winding induction <b>coils</b> for motorboat <b>engines.</b> Snell was educated in the Brookline, Massachusetts schools and then enrolled at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire where he continued his passion for mathematics and science, focusing on genetics. He received his Bachelor's degree from Dartmouth in 1926.|$|R
50|$|For {{segmented}} stator coils, {{a distinction}} is made between T-segments and plugged <b>engine</b> <b>coils.</b> The latter may be bodiless or winded onto a coil body and subsequently {{be transferred to}} a T-segment or directly to the stator laminations, depending on the application. Contingent on the expected contact points, there are three different options {{for the production of}} T-segments.For one, there is the classic single T-segment with the disadvantage of having a high number of contact points. In addition, there is the phase winded T-segment with a reduced number of contact points. Finally, there is also the winding of so-called pole chains with a drastically reduced number of contact points.|$|R
5000|$|In 1915, an American named Charles J. McHugh filed {{a patent}} {{application}} for the diaphragm type of engine, {{which was an}} improvement to Piot's design. In 1920, William Purcell filed a patent for the coiled tube type of engine. This type of engine has been very common {{over the years in}} homemade pop pop boats, due to its simplicity of construction. The Cub Scout book (published by the Boy Scouts of America) contained a project called a [...] "Jet Boat" [...] for many years. This project used a <b>coil</b> type of <b>engine</b> based on Purcell's design which was placed in a wooden hull. Many commercial pop pop boats have also used this type of engine, due to its low cost.|$|R
50|$|In time, the {{trembler}} coil {{system was}} seen as obsolete and was replaced, first by the ignition magneto and later by Kettering's battery ignition system, using battery, coil and contact breaker. These systems used a single ignition <b>coil</b> for the <b>engine,</b> supplying the spark to each cylinder in turn. A device called the distributor (previously used with magnetos) was used to switch the high-voltage current to each plug in turn. The high voltage distributor evolved from the timer and it too was a rotary switch driven at camshaft speed. The first high voltage distributors likewise used a wiping-contact, but as the current was at such a high voltage, these gave trouble with arcing and erosion of the contacts leading to a poor connection. It was realised that a jump-spark distributor would work equally well at high voltages and would be less susceptible to problems from erosion.|$|R
50|$|Turn-of-the-century, two-story {{homes are}} prevalent. Close to downtown, many homes have barns which once housed the family horse and carriage; the barns now shelter the family car. About {{one-quarter of the}} homes in Milan were built before World War II, and 21 percent built between 1940 and 1959. A symbol of the {{architecture}} is Community House, a two-story grist mill Henry Ford purchased in 1935. Ford had an <b>engine</b> <b>coil</b> manufacturing plant in an area which is now a parking lot between the police station and city hall. He had a soybean processing plant next to the former flour mill (now used for public works). Ford probably had the idea to make paint from soybeans, but the Milan plant did not make paint, just soybean oil. Area residents can utilize the Community House for small gatherings and it now houses the City Recreation Department dance studio.|$|R
50|$|Production {{started in}} 1960 using a Riley, twin-carburettor version, of the 1.5 litre BMC B Series engine, {{independent}} front suspension by torsion bar modified {{from that of the}} Morris Minor and live rear axle suspended by <b>coil</b> springs. Other <b>engines</b> could be fitted including the Morris Minor, MG MGA, and Ford 109E. The engine and front suspension was mounted on a tubular steel subframe bonded to the body shell and roll over protection was provided by a steel tube over the windscreen. The car appeared at the Copenhagen Racing Car Show and the Geneva Motor Show. A very complete kit, including an engine and all other mechanical parts, cost £670. About 250 were made when the fire caused production to be suspended. The car was available in both left and right hand drive and cars were exported to several countries including Australia and the United States. On test by The Motor magazine in 1961 a 1.5 litre Riley engined model achieved a top speed of 102 mph and a 0-60 mph time of 11.9 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|An {{ignition}} coil (also called a spark coil) is an induction coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's low voltage {{to the thousands}} of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the {{ignition coil}} to the distributor and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads. Originally, every ignition coil system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the ignition coil. A modern passenger automobile may use one ignition <b>coil</b> for each <b>engine</b> cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses.|$|R
50|$|All trucks of {{the series}} share a modular design. They have a torsionally rigid {{box-section}} frame with highly mobile axles linked to the frame via <b>coil</b> springs. The <b>engine</b> is mounted inside the forward-control cab, which is separated into a driver and engine compartment by a firewall. As a distinctive feature, the engine is located {{to the rear of}} the driver compartment instead of beneath it. This way, the total height could be kept below 2.9 m, which means the trucks can be transported on standard railway flatcars. The characteristic, cut-away corners of the otherwise box-shaped cab ensure compliance with the railway loading gauge. The cab of the first batch does not tilt forward for maintenance because the vehicles were still based on the amphibious prototypes. The tilting cab was only introduced with the second batch in the mid-80s. The engine powers the front and rear axles via a torque converter, semi-automatic transmission and a transfer case. In the first batch KAT I, these components form a single, special unit. The later KAT I A1 series uses cheaper mass-produced, standard truck components. At the same time, this allowed to raise the number of gears from six to 16, and the theoretical top speed from 90 to about 130 km/h. This in turn led to much lower engine speeds at the usual top speed of 80 km/h, lowering fuel consumption. Vehicle voltage is standard 24 Volts. The tow hitch is a standard NATO coupling suitable for towing trailers even in difficult terrain, although they must be equipped with the matching lunette ring.|$|R
50|$|The SY413 Baleno (also {{known as}} the Cultus Esteem and Esteem in other countries) was {{assembled}} in Pakistan starting 1998 as a replacement of Suzuki Margalla, till 2006 when it {{was replaced by the}} Liana. When introduced, it featured a number of improvements over Margalla, such standard power steering, wider tyres (175/70R13 vs 155/80R13), tachometer as standard, 4-spoke steering wheel vs. 2-spoke steering wheel of Margalla, black interior vs grey interior, EFi vs carburettor and 16-valve vs 8-valve. It featured the G13BB engine, though on the chassis plate throughout the entire run it was stamped as G13B. Initial trim levels included GL, GXi, Gli and GliP (also known as Gli Plus). Baleno featured highly advanced technology at its time, as it {{was the first one to}} offer distributorless EFi. Despite this, the car has difficult sales period till 2002 when a facelift was launched featuring crystal headlamps and revised grille. CNG version was also offered soon. Trim levels in the facelift model included JXR and JXL. Baleno Sport also saw a limited run. In the very initial days before local assembly, a few specimen were imported from Japan by Pak Suzuki Motors to test the market. These featured a SOHC G16B engine with electronic fuel injection but fuel ignition by camshaft driven electronic distributor. This car remains a rare item in the used car market normally known as Baleno 1.6 or Baleno Gti. Although the car ran without problem using petrol, the CNG versions faced various problems such as backfire and burning of <b>coils.</b> Replacing the <b>engine</b> with an EFi 1.5L G15A is a popular swap (G15A does not use distributorless ignition, coil-on-plug or waste-spark-discharge). Reasons being simpler to maintain, higher power output and greater fuel economy.|$|R

In 1962 the GTO Ferrari coupés had a remarkable season of successes in G.T. racing and have become the standard by which any competition coupé is measured, and by steady development Ferrari 250GT {{has become one of}} the world's greatest cars." [...] MOTOR SPORT, March 1963.1953 saw the first serious attempt to series produce the Ferrari motor car, two models of the Type 250 Europa being produced. The cars were an evolution of the previous models, available with either the Colombo or Lampredi versions of the 250 V12 <b>engine,</b> <b>coil</b> spring front suspension, an improved sports gearbox (four speeds) with Porsche synchromesh, large drum brakes and luxurious outfitting.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Maldives is a small country without any conventional energy resources and desperately needs alternative means to power their industry. The work assesses the suitability of coconut oil as an alternative diesel fuel for the use on the individual islands of the Maldives. A study was carried out to identify the availability of resources relative to the energy requirements {{of the country and}} coconuts became the most suitable candidate to produce an alternative fuel for the existing diesel engines. For the study on the long term effects of coconut oil and its derivatives (Methyl and Ethyl Esters) a single cylinder direct injection Lister-Petter engine model AD I was used. The engine was equipped for continous condition monitoring using a data acquisition system. The system measures the in-cylinder and fuel injection pressures relative to the crank angle. Also the cylinder and exhaust temperatures were measured for all the fuels. Since the viscosity of the crude coconut oil is relatively high compared to diesel a transesterification process was developed to reduce the viscosity and this gave very good results. The physical and chemical properties of the fuels were measured. The engine was initially tested using a 20 h test cycle with each fuel and this was followed by a 200 h test cycle on <b>COIL.</b> The <b>engine</b> performance was mapped in terms of speed, load, volumetric fuel and air flow. In addition, exhaust gas analysis was carried out to measure the regulated emissions. Tenax glass fibre, coconut charcoal filters and dinitropheny 1 hydrazone tubes were used to sample the unregulated emissions. The pressures and temperatures were continuously observed and recorded at intervals. The ignition delay measurements showed that COIL and COME had shorter ignition delay periods compared to diesel fuel. During the tests engine lubricating oil was checked for possible fuel dilution. After every 100 engine running hours, the engine was opened and physically inspected for wear and damage, as well as for carbon and lacquer deposits. Pictures were taken of the cylinder liner, piston top and cylinder head. The fuel injector was removed and tested on the fuel injector test rig. The results were favourable and also the scanning electron microscope measurements of the injector nozzle show that the deposits were low when compared to diesel. A novel non-intrusive combustion chamber deposit thickness measuring system was developed to measure the deposit thickness. A separate rig was built using a similar type of fuel injection system as that on the engine for fuel spray studies. Initially fuel spray photography was done using a high speed camera to determine the pattern of the spray, spray penetration rate and the cone angle for the three fuels. Once this was established a Malvern particle sizing system was used to measure the droplet sizes for all fuels. The results of the spray experiments helped to explain differences observed in the engine performance for the different fuels. All the work carried out to date supports the use of coconut oil as an alternative fuel for diesel engines in the Maldives...|$|R
