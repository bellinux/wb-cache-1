In organics the interactions are small, while in <b>cuprates</b> the repulsion U_d on the Cu site is the largest energy. The Mott AF state is stable in undoped materials in both cases. In the metallic phase of <b>cuprates</b> the U_d→∞ limit produces a moderate effective repulsion. The theories of the coherent SDW and charge-transfer correlations in the metallic phases of organics and <b>cuprates</b> are thus similar. In (undoped) organics those correlations are associated with commensurate 2 k_F SDW and 4 k_F bond or site modes. The corresponding modes in metallic <b>cuprates</b> are the incommensurate SDW and in particular O_x/O_y quadrupolar charge transfer with wave vector 2 q_SDW=q_ 0 +G.
