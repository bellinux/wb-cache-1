25|$|Meanwhile, on March 10, 1826, his father, King João VI, {{died and}} his brother Peter, the heir-apparent to the throne, became king as Peter IV. Peter, however, was {{committed}} to continuing as Emperor of Brazil and therefore abdicated the crown of Portugal in favor of his daughter, Maria II. Since the young sovereign was not yet of age, he instituted a regency, under his sister, Isabel Maria. Peter had already attempted to coerce Miguel to Brazil (1822) away from their mother without any success. Following {{the death of their}} father, Peter once again attempted to mend fences within the family and ensure Maria II's right to the throne by offering Miguel the regency of Portugal (when he became 25) under a new liberal <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Charter</b> that would re-establish a constitutional monarchy. Under this arrangement, Queen Maria II and Miguel would be married when she came of age; until then Miguel would be her regent in Portugal. The new <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Charter</b> gave the crown moderating authority between the legislative, executive and judiciary, and introduced a 100-member Chamber of Peers (which included aristocrats and bishops and archbishops), a royal veto and indirect elections. Miguel accepted the proposal from his brother, swore to uphold the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Charter</b> and, since the young Queen was only nine years old, waited until she would reach the age of marriage.|$|E

25|$|Carlos I was a {{constitutional}} monarch. He did not claim autocratic power, but instead ruled {{according to the}} <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Charter</b> of 1826 which stated that the succession to the throne passed only to legitimate descendants. The Constitution, including all matters of succession, could only be amended by the Cortes. Even if Carlos had signed a document granting succession rights to Maria Pia, {{it would have had}} no legal value at all.|$|E
25|$|On March 13, 1828 Miguel {{dissolved}} the Cortes without calling new elections, as stipulated in the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Charter.</b> Some municipal councils, many nobles and clergy, {{and several}} important citizens {{requested that the}} regent revoke the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Charter</b> and reign as king. Blood was first spilled by the liberals, when delegates from the University of Coimbra (who ostensibly traveled to Lisbon to present their compliments to Miguel) were murdered on March 18 by hot-headed Coimbran students. On April 25, the senate (of the university), issued a proclamation in which they requested that Miguel assume the throne. This only fueled the divisions between liberals and absolutists. Because of the independence of Brazil, Miguel's supporters considered Miguel to be the legitimate heir to the crown of Portugal. If, to liberals, the name of Miguel was despised, to the legitimists (the absolutists) it was venerated. But Miguel's reign was immediately marked by cruel, almost tyrannical, governance which some attribute to him personally; however some blame the injustices on his subordinates, while others attribute them to the malevolence of Queen Charlotte.|$|E
25|$|But Miguel's {{role was}} clearly {{delineated}} {{by his first}} night in Lisbon: he would govern as regent {{in the name of}} the rightful sovereign of Portugal, Queen Maria II.

Between 1839 and 1880, six constitutions were approved by the legislative power. Except for the constitution of 1839, which limited presidential power, the constitutions promulgated under José Ballivián y Segurola (1843), Manuel Isidoro Belzú Humérez (1851), José María Achá Valiente (1861), Mariano Melgarejo Valencia (1868), and Agustín Morales Hernández (1871) further concentrated {{power in the hands of}} the executive.

25|$|Ferdinand's {{policy of}} {{centralization}} was continued {{during the reign}} of his son Alfonso X; during a period of unrest in Compostela, with the city council confronted with the archbishop, he introduced an alcalde or representative of the Crown into the local government, later delivering the see of Compostela to a Castilian, after forcing archbishop Gonsalvo Gomes to flee to France; thus starting a process that eventually led to the replacement of Galician bishops, abbots and noblemen, by Castilians during 15th, 16th, and successive centuries. Anyway, and in contrast with his father, he again usually favoured the bourgeois through the concession of numerous <b>constitutional</b> <b>charters</b> to new towns, angering the nobility.|$|R

40|$|Many modern <b>constitutional</b> <b>charters</b> of {{fundamental}} rights authorize {{the limitation of}} the rights they entrench. The very abstract terms in which constitutional rights are usually formulated make collisions among them, and between different individuals' entitlements under a single right, inevitable. Naturally, this requires determination {{of the limits of}} rival rights and of the entitlements they grant to individuals. It also seems to render legislative and administrative determination of these rights unobjectionable, provided that this is, as these constitutions require, policed by independent courts - there are typically many different ways in which clashing rights and interests might be reconciled in particular circumstances, and it seems appropriate that in democracies the choice of means should be left to an elected legislature and the government over which it exercises ultimate control, while the courts ensure that the choices so made remain within the broad framework of the charter of rights...|$|R

25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{parliamentary}} institution occurred in 1824, with the award of the first Brazilian <b>constitutional</b> <b>charter,</b> allowing the General Assembly (Parliament) to take a leading role in policy guidance of the nation. The second step was in 1826 when a minority deputy Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos successfully demanded that the ministers of state had to present the government's financial accounts before the Chamber of Deputies. The third step, the most important, was taken in 1847 when Francisco de Paula Souza demanded the creation of the office of the President of the Council of Ministers (equivalent to the Prime Minister, and holding executive power). These steps resulted in the consolidation of Brazilian parliamentarism, {{in the same manner as}} the consolidation of British parliamentarism, as it would facilitate the distinction between Executive Power and Moderating Power.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} two years, the <b>Constitutional</b> <b>Charter</b> was {{the law of the}} land, but the {{government}} and the opposition could not agree: Queen Maria II replaced the government four times, then finally dissolved Parliament and called new elections to bridge the impasse. The opposition saw the charter as the source of governmental inertia and political deterioration, and wanted to return to the 1822 Liberal Constitution. These liberals were motivated by the movements in Spain, where in August 1836, a revolt by military officers (the Motín de La Granja de San Ildefonso) forced the reinstatement of the 1812 Cadiz Constitution. Ultimately, on 9 September 1836 a revolution in Lisbon by the politicized population and the National Guard to drive the Cartistas (Chartists) from power forced Queen Maria II to reinstate the 1822 Constitution. Members of the government installed following the revolution were known as Setembristas, after their short-lived movement, the Setembrismo, which was launched in September. Although this manifestation of popular sentiment was a reactionary movement against political instability and later supported by the military and burgher politicians, it was hampered by constant popular demands which paralyzed government activity.|$|E

These new reguengo villages (royal villages under direct royal political and economical control, and administered by their autonomous city councils), each one usually known as a burgo due to its walled circuits, constituted important attraction points for peasants, who could find better life conditions under the direct protection of the king than abroad {{under the authority of}} a bishop, a monastery or a nobleman; but they also attracted foreigners, most notably artisans and merchants, who brought new trends and knowledges. These burgs supposed a revolution in the social structure of the time, leading to economic diversification, removing the dominant autarky of the previous centuries, and facilitating the development of fishing and pre-industrial activities oriented toward the mass production of some resources, especially salted and dried fish, fish oil, and wine, marketed through the seaports north to England, and south to the Mediterranean.|$|R

Caught between Charles and Grenville, Essex took up positions at Lostwithiel and Fowey, hoping for support or evacuation by the Parliamentarian fleet. The Royalists cut off his escape routes by land and on 13 August Charles began his attack. On 21 August, the Royalists took Restormel Castle and Beacon Hill, Lostwithiel. After further sporadic fighting they pushed the Parliamentarians back to Castle Dore above the Fowey river on 31 August. That night the Parliamentarian cavalry broke through the encircling Royalists and escaped to Plymouth. On 1 September the Royalists took Castle Dore and Essex escaped by sea, leaving his 6000 infantry, artillery and baggage train {{under the command of}} Sir Philip Skippon, who surrendered the following day. The Royalists confiscated the Parliamentarians' weapons and then allowed them to return to Portsmouth. Afflicted by bad weather, hunger, disease and attacks from local people, 1000 of the disarmed soldiers died along the way. Their time in Lostwithiel saw the vandalism of Lostwithiel Stannary Palace, Jonathan Rashleigh's Menabilly House, the destruction of all the <b>constitutional</b> <b>Charters</b> and Stannary records placed in Luxulyan church for safety. The ensuing debate in London about the unsatisfactory manner of the war led to the passage of the Self-Denying Ordinance.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the relevance of}} national identity to EU and domestic judicial practice. It argues {{that there are two}} parallel universes of protection in the EU Treaty and national constitutions which often pose conflicting obligations to those bound by them and which do not communicate nearly enough. Judicial interpretation of the relevant EU and national provisions is a welcome development but not always key to reconciling differences. To this purpose, the article reflects on the CJEU’s interpretation of the EU’s renewed commitment in the Lisbon Treaty to protect national identities. It also provides a comparative overview of how Member States have construed their own national identity. The latter involves making connections with current issues emerging from post-Lisbon domestic case law that this article contributes to and advances. As it is illustrated, the respect for national identity afforded by the Treaty is amorphous and often fails to capture the level of protection mandated by national constitutions. At the same time, national constitutions provide a fuzzy picture with different levels of commitment to identity. The way these two <b>constitutional</b> <b>charters</b> have been interpreted by European and certain national judges will help us identify the different approaches and illustrate the conflict between them vis-à-vis the concept of an EU federalised structure. Ultimately, the article aims to create a typology of situations where identity retention should be reserved to Member States with a view to resolving the current tension between the two legal orders. It will point to the possibility for a plurality of ‘limited powers’ approach acting as a check on the EU, while avoiding the risk of jeopardising the course of European integration...|$|R
