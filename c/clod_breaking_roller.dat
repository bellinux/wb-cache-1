In the present work, we concentrate on quantifying the contribution of the wave <b>breaking</b> <b>roller</b> to the total microwave backscatter and optical intensity signals. Analysis of the power outputs of both breaking and non-breaking events demonstrates that the backscatter from the wave roller is distinguishable from relict foam and appears to be independent of environmental conditions. Finally, we test a volumetric scattering model against the wave breaking observations. This is a new application for this type of scattering model. The model treats the wave roller as a multi-phase body where most of the scattering arises from a layer of water droplets representing the wave roller. The model shows an improved agreement with the data as compared to the traditional surface scattering model...|$|R

The best kind of soil structure for plant growth is granular structure, which resembles cookie crumbs and is usually less than 0. 5 centimeter in diameter. One important soil property that can be easily overlooked is soil structure or tilth. Soil structure refers to the spatial arrangement of soil particles. These aggregates form through physical, chemical and biological processes, which will greatly influence soil quality (Brady and Weil, 2008). Good soil structure is a hallmark of healthy soil. If soils are healthy, then healthy turf can follow. An easy way to determine soil structure quality is to collect surface soil between 5 centimeters (cm) and 10 cm deep. Gently toss the soil in {{the palm of your hand}} to break up the soil. Take a representative soil clod and gently try to break it apart.

40|$|Wheat {{flour milling}} {{involves}} repeated breakage (by roller milling) and separation (by sifting) of flour particles to give efficient recovery of fine flour relatively free from bran contamination. A {{starting point for}} modelling the behaviour of mixtures of wheat kernels {{is to be able}} to measure the variation in kernel properties within the mixture. The Perten Single Kernel Characterisation System (SKCS) gives the distributions of kernel mass, moisture content, diameter and hardness within a mixture, from 300 kernels within 5 minutes. A challenge remains to relate these measured distributions to predictions of milling performance. To this end, a breakage function in terms of these measured parameters for individual kernels has been constructed, and integrated over the distribution of kernel properties using the breakage equation. These models allow prediction of the output particle size distribution delivered by First <b>Break</b> <b>roller</b> milling of kernels varying in size, hardness and variety, based entirely on SKCS characteristics. Predictions have been developed for both sharp-to-sharp and dull-to-dull roll dispositions, and show encouraging agreement with independent data...|$|R

40|$|A {{tidal bore}} is {{a surge of}} waters {{propagating}} upstream in an estuary as the tidal flow turns to rising and the flood tide propagates into a funnel-shaped system. Large tidal bores have a marked <b>breaking</b> <b>roller.</b> The sounds generated by breaking tidal bores were herein investigated in the field (Qiantang River) and in laboratory. The sound pressure record showed two dominant periods, with some similarity with an earlier study [Chanson (2009). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 125 (6), 3561 – 3568]. The two distinct phases were the incoming tidal bore when the sound amplitude increased with the approaching bore, and {{the passage of the}} tidal bore in front of the microphone when loud and powerful noises were heard. The dominant frequency ranged from 57 to 131 [*]Hz in the Qiantang River bore. A comparison between laboratory and prototype tidal bores illustrated both common features and differences. The low pitch sound of the breaking bore had a dominant frequency close to the collective oscillations of bubble clouds, which could be modeled with a bubble cloud model using a transverse dimension of the bore roller. The findings suggest that this model might be over simplistic {{in the case of a}} powerful breaking bore, like that of the Qiantang River...|$|R
40|$|A {{simplified}} model describing wheat breakage during roller milling is presented. Previous work {{introduced the}} breakage equation describing First <b>Break</b> <b>roller</b> milling of wheat {{in terms of}} a breakage function that incorporated relevant input and processing parameters such as roll gap, kernel diameter and kernel hardness. The resulting empirical function, based on polynomial fits, was sufficiently flexible to describe the range of particle size distributions encountered in typical milling operations, but contained a high number of coefficients, making the interpretation of the physical significance of the coefficients difficult and requiring an excessive amount of experimental data. The current work simplifies the breakage function by normalising the output particle size distribution against the milling ratio raised to a power. The Kumaraswamy probability distribution function is then used to describe the normalised data obtained following First Break milling {{of a wide range of}} wheat at different roll gaps under both Sharp-to-Sharp and Dull-to-Dull roll dispositions. Using this approach, the effects of roll gap and kernel diameter on wheat breakage can be described using just four parameters. This simplified equation is more practical and versatile for implementation in process integration strategies for the purpose of design and optimisation of cereal processes for food and non-food uses...|$|R
40|$|Models {{based on}} the {{breakage}} equation for roller milling {{have been developed to}} predict the output particle size distribution delivered by First <b>Break</b> <b>roller</b> milling of wheat from distributions of single kernel characteristics. These models allow prediction of the breakage of mixtures of kernels of unknown origin or varieties and varying in size and hardness, based solely on Perten Single Kernel Characterisation System (SKCS) characteristics. Predictions have been developed for both Sharp-to-Sharp and Dull-to-Dull roll dispositions, and show good agreement with independent data. Milling under a Dull-to-Dull disposition is more sensitive to kernel bardness and gives a more pronounced U-shaped distribution of output particle sizes (i. e. large proportions of both small and large particles, with few in the mid-size range) than Sharp-to-Sharp milling. Similarly, softer wheats break to give a more U-shaped distribution than harder wheats. These findings also demonstrate that kernel hardness as reported by the SKCS is meaningful in relation to wheat breakage during roller milling. Previous work has shown that single kernel moisture measurements can be included in predictive equations; further work reported here demonstrates the potential to add the fourth SKCS parameter, kernel mass, to predictions in order to allow for the effect of kernel shape on breakage. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{particle}} size distribution (psd) produced by breakage of wheat in the Perten Single Kernel Characterisation System (SKCS) was measured using sonic sifting, {{for a range of}} wheat varieties, kernel sizes and moisture contents. At moisture contents of 16 % wb, the psd produced by the SKCS was very evenly spread over the range 106 - 3350 µm, with the average {{particle size}} much greater than would result from roller milling. Hard wheats gave slightly smaller average particle sizes in the broken material (this was unexpected and contrasts with First <b>Break</b> <b>roller</b> milling, for which hard wheats give larger output particles than soft wheats), but the variation in psd among different wheat varieties was surprisingly small. This indicates that the SKCS exerts a very positive breakage action on wheat grains, giving similar degrees of breakage to kernels of different hardness. The reported hardness index therefore depends primarily on the crushing force profile or energy to grind, and is not confounded by differences in the extent of breakage achieved. Kernel size similarly gave little difference in the output psd. The effect of increasing the moisture content from 9 to 17 % wb was to increase the average output particle size greatly; moist kernels do not break so readily in the SKCS...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} wheat {{properties}} on breakage during First <b>Break</b> <b>roller</b> milling, {{as described by}} the Double Normalised Kumaraswamy Breakage Function (DNKBF), were investigated. A set of 45 wheats from nine varieties representing the range of commercial varieties grown in the UK, and grown over three harvest years at several nitrogen fertiliser levels, were milled at five roll gaps under Sharp-to-Sharp and Dull-to-Dull dispositions. The resulting particle size distributions were fitted with a DNKBF {{in order to understand}} the physical significance of the DNKBF parameters and to relate them to shape and hardness. The DNKBF parameters related strongly to hardness as measured using either the Single Kernel Characterisation System or Particle Size Index, allowing the particle size distribution over the range 0 – 4000 μm to be predicted solely from wheat hardness. A residual analysis showed that the remaining variation was correlated with kernel mass, and that more elongated kernels break to give slightly larger particles than more spherical kernels of equivalent hardness. Two types of breakage are identified, one of which principally produces many small endosperm particles along with large bran particles, while the other tends to produce mid-sized particles. The former dominates under Dull-to-Dull milling and for soft wheats, while the latter becomes more prominent under Sharp-to-Sharp milling and for harder wheat...|$|R

The SPs were successfully implemented on US 30 and US 20 projects and the information from the RICM rollers conveniently met the requirements of the SPs for roller coverage. The IA 9 project encountered problems with roller data storage/export during construction leading to not meeting the coverage requirements of the project SP. Testing was conducted on each project by the Iowa State University research team beyond the requirements of the project specifications to analyze asphalt density, RICM values, and asphalt surface temperature changes with pass count and time. Comparisons between RICM values and asphalt density/percent compaction yielded poor correlations, but relationship with falling weight deflectometer modulus values revealed good correlations. Influence of the foundation support conditions under the asphalt surface layer is a major contributor to characterizing correlations between RICM measurements and asphalt density measurements. Geostatistical analysis of pass coverage information revealed differences in pass coverage uniformity between projects.
