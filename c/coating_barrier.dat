40|$|In this work, the {{filiform}} corrosion behaviour of powder painted aluminium profiles was studied, and the <b>coating</b> <b>barrier</b> properties together with adhesion to the substrate were analysed. Samples {{coated with a}} traditional painting procedure (one powder layer application followed by curing), and other samples coated using a special cycle to obtain wood grain effect were compared using accelerated {{filiform corrosion}} tests. Moreover, {{in order to better}} understand the degradation mechanisms of painted metal substrates, thermal stresses were applied to accelerate the natural weathering. The effects of the thermal aging were analysed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Wood grain effect coatings showed to better resist, with respect to a traditional coating, to filiform corrosion when testing was performed following the DIN 65472 standard. On the contrary, electrochemical impedance measurements showed better barrier properties against water uptake for the traditional coating after thermal ageing. Different barrier properties were found to depend on the microstructure of the two coatings after curing. The traditional one has a homogeneous microstructure, with completely fused powder grains and very fine size pigments. On the contrary, wood grain effect coating possesses a "defective" microstructure with a widespread distribution of partially fused powders grains determining a dense network of grain boundaries, moreover coarser size pigments are present. This microstructure decreases the <b>coating</b> <b>barrier</b> properties, but also can determine a loss of plasticity and the coating under mechanical stress can crack modifying the filiform corrosion behaviour...|$|E

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study using}} a two-flux approximation of the radiative transfer equation {{was performed to}} examine the effects of an opaque reflective layer on the thermal behavior of a typical semitransparent thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> on an opaque substrate. Some ceramic materials are semitransparent in the wavelength ranges where thermal radiation is important. Even with an opaque layer on each side of the semitransparent thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating,</b> scattering and absorption can have an effect on the heat transfer. In this work, a thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> that is semitransparent up to a wavelength of 5 micrometers is considered. Above 5 micrometers wavelength, the thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> is opaque. The absorption and scattering coefficient of the thermal barrier was varied. The thermal behavior of the thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> with an opaque reflective layer is compared to a thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> without the reflective layer. For a thicker thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> with lower convective loading, which would be typical of a combustor liner, a reflective layer can significantly decrease the temperature in the thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> and substrate if the scattering is weak or moderate and for strong scattering if the absorption is large. The layer without the reflective coating can be about as effective as the layer with the reflective coating if the absorption is small and the scattering strong. For low absorption, some temperatures in the thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> system can be slightly higher with the reflective layer. For a thin thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating</b> with high convective loading, which would be typical of a blade or vane that sees the hot sections of the combustor, the reflective layer is not as effective.

To address this problem, we present a method to prepare graphene-based superhydrophobic composite coatings with robust mechanical strength, self-cleaning, and barrier properties. A suspension has been formulated that contains a mixture of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and diatomaceous earth (DE) modified with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) {{that can be applied}} on any surface using common coating methods such as spraying, brush painting, and dip coating. Inclusion of TiO 2 nanoparticles to the formulation shows further increase in water contact angle (WCA) from 159 ± 2 ° to 170 ± 2 ° due to the structural improvement with hierarchical surface roughness. Mechanical stability and durability of the coatings has been achieved by using a commercial adhesive to bond the superhydrophobic "paint" to various substrates. Excellent retention of superhydrophobicity was observed even after sandpaper abrasion and crosscut scratching. A potentiodynamic polarization study revealed excellent corrosion resistance (96. 78 %) properties, and an acid was used to provide further insight into <b>coating</b> <b>barrier</b> properties.

We proposed a plasma assisted route to engineer polymer films and non-woven fabrics with antimicrobial nano-composite coatings. The project aims to optimize atmospheric pressure plasma deposition {{in order to}} engineer the coatings with high antibacterial activity and low cytotoxicity. Different methods of deposition are tested including radio-frequency plasma, direct current discharge in nitrogen as well barrier discharge in air with two methods of nano-particles incorporation: aerosol and impregnation. Nano-particles Ag, Cu and ZnO are tested as antimicrobial agents with average nano-particle size of about 50 nm. Nanoparticles are incorporated in between two layers of an organosilicon film with an impregnation process or alternatively through an aerosol injection step with averaged concentration of the nano-particles in the solution ranging in between 10 to 1000 mg/l. Incorporation is made in a “sandwich-like structure” where a top layer <b>coating</b> (<b>barrier)</b> of 5 - 50 nm thickness is used for precise control of metal ions release and a reservation layer of about 200 nm is used for NPs load. The effect of the barrier coating on the surface concentration of nano-particles is determined by XPS. It is shown that an increase of {{the thickness of the}} barrier layer from 5 to 25 nm leads to a decrease of Ag content from 0. 24 to 0. 08 at. %. Similar effect is found for nano-particles of Cu and ZnO. Antibacterial efficiency of the samples against P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and S. aureus M u 50 bacteria shows that all treated samples exhibit higher antibacterial efficiency against S. aureus.

40|$|Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (AP PECVD) of {{thin films}} is a {{recently}} emerged technology, showing important advantages {{in comparison with}} the traditional and well established low pressure plasma enhanced deposition methods. The main benefit of AP-PECVD is the potential of cost efficient in-line production without expensive and bulky vacuum equipment. In this work, an innovative AP plasma jet system is investigated which serves as a pilot system for industrial scale equipment, the VITO PlasmaLine®. Applications include moisture/oxygen diffusion barriers as well as grease barriers, UV curing of coatings or chemical activation of a surface. For industrial application a high throughput (~ 100 - 1000 m/min) is critical in order to compete with conventional techniques, such as wet chemical <b>coating.</b> <b>Barrier</b> coating deposition by AP-PECVD on polymer substrates has been demonstrated to be superior to wet chemical coating, with less consumption of precursor material [1], though many technical challenges remain to obtain the desired (dynamic) growth rates. The pilot equipment utilizes a 0. 5 mm double slit configuration with 1000 - 2000 W power input at a frequency of 40 - 50 kHz with N 2 as the primary carrier gas. By utilizing the plasma afterglow remote from the source, uniform surface treatment can be achieved despite the filamentary discharge in the slits. Deposition on the electrodes is prevented by injection of precursor into the jet and because of the remote nature of the plasma source the thermal load on the substrate is minimized, making it ideally suited for treatment of polymers and paper. A key area for improvement and upscaling of the pilot system for industrial application is optimization of gaseous and liquid (aerosol) precursor injection. To this end, extensive characterization of the plasma jet is undertaken, including current-voltage, fast imaging and optical emission and absorption measurements, with focus on the dynamics of gaseous and aerosol precursor particles in the jet.

SO 2 and NOx reacts with marble composed primarily of calcite (CaCO 3) is a dry deposition process, gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) and nitrocalcite (Ca(NO 3) 2. 4 H 2 O) are formed after reaction. The polylactic acid (PLA), 2, 5 and 7 wt. % montmorillonite (MMT) clay added PLA (PLA/MMT 2, PLA/MMT 5 and PLA/MMT 7) bio-nano composites coated and uncoated surfaces were tested for capillary water absorption, water vapor permeability, color alteration, and surface hydrophobicity regarding the nanofiller concentrations before reaction. Results indicated that the bio-nano composite coatings didn’t alter {{the color of the}} marble, improved the hydrophobicity and barrier properties of the marbles. The level of layered silicate delamination in the PLA matrix and structural characterizations of PLA nanocomposite coatings were affected the barrier properties of the composites coatings.

40|$|Marine {{pipelines}} {{at the sea}} bottom {{are protected}} by a coating to prevent corrosion. Lifetime of coating are limited by coatings delamination. Delamination is caused by ingression of seawater through the coating and later attack of the metal. A zirconium conversion pre-treatment applied on the metal is used to improve the adhesion between the coating and metal substrate. During in-service lifetime, pipelines encounter cyclic loadings due to vortex induced vibrations or movements of fluid within the pipe which might affect the mechanical properties of the coating. The goal of this work is to investigate {{the effect of these}} cyclic loadings combined with immersion period on the epoxy coatings on the steel with and without a zirconium conversion layer. Samples are stressed in the elastic, and plastic region (of the steel) in uniaxial tensile direction, and also they strained up to 5 % to investigate the effect of mechanical damage. After these tests, samples are immersed in NaCl solution for 30 days to evaluate the barrier properties of the coatings and compared their performance with the unstressed immersed samples. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to monitor the protective properties of the coatings. Finally, adhesion tests are performed {{to see whether or not}} the adhesion strength of epoxy decreases by the combination of mechanical loading and immersion. Immersion of 30 days does not affect the <b>coating</b> <b>barrier</b> properties and Epoxy coated systems with and without Zr-pretreatment showed high barrier properties after 30 days of immersion in corrosive environment. Coated samples with and without Zr-pretreatment were not affected by cyclic loading in the elastic region. No cracks in the coatings were detected. Only a slightly increased of the roughness was noticed. EIS results showed that barrier properties of the coatings after elastic cyclic-loading are not affected and remained constant after the 30 days of immersion. Different behaviour after cyclic loading in the plastic region between treated and un-treated samples is observed. Samples without pre-treatment showed a decreasing of the barrier properties during the immersion test while treated-samples showed still high performance. An explanation is that cyclic loading in the plastic region affect significantly the polymer structure, creating a more open network. Then the penetration of solution is facilitated, affecting the protection properties of the coating. Additionally the roughness of the coatings increased significantly for (un) -treated samples. This is caused by a rougher steel substrate and the formation of shear bands in the epoxy coating. However the pre-treated samples showed no changes in the barrier properties. This may be associated to the better adhesion between the polymer and coating by the presence of zirconium layer. The adhesion strength is significantly affected by elastic/ plastic cyclic loading and 30 days of immersion for untreated and treated samples. More investigation is needed to discover if cyclic loading affects the adhesion strength or the combination of cyclic loading and immersion period. However it is believed that cyclic loading has an influence on the adhesion strength; the decrease of adhesion strength by only immersion is limited while the adhesion strength after cyclic loading and immersion has a much higher detrimental influence.

40|$|Paper based {{materials}} have limited vapour barrier properties. Several techniques {{have been developed}} to overcome this limitation. One of such technique is the use of barrier dispersion coatings. These barriers are continuous and solid layers normally applied on the surface of paper materials. Dispersion coatings are normally composed of two materials; a latex binder and filler particles. The interaction between these materials creates tortuous pathways that reduce the diffusion of the permeant. The main objective {{of this study was to}} develop an understanding of how the dispersion coatings can be designed to optimise the barrier properties of paper materials. In particular, the aim was to comprehend the effect of fillers added into dispersion coatings on the permeability with the purpose of developing of a model for predicting permeability. A number of models {{have been developed to}} predict the permeability of barrier films such as thermoplastic composites but none have been applied or developed for use on barrier dispersion coatings. These models are normally based on idealised geometries, where the fillers are arranged in either oriented or random ways. The heterogeneous characteristics of the barrier dispersion coatings, such as uneven coating thickness, particle size and the lower elongation of the fillers used in dispersion coatings limit the use of the existing models for the prediction of dispersion <b>coating</b> <b>barrier</b> performance. To develop a predictive model, the characterisation of aspects such as shape, size distribution and volume fraction of fillers in barrier coatings and their effect on the barrier performance were studied. The analysis of the geometry of fillers was carried out by image analysis from microscopy (scanning electron and light microscopes). This was carried out on three types of kaolin clays. The shapes, Feret diameters, and thicknesses of the clays were characterised. The filler shapes were elongated with an average ratio between the major and minor diameter being no larger than two. The Fourier series descriptor approximates the filler shape at the second harmonic. The Feret diameter and thickness were fitted to distribution curves. These distributions were used to define the fillers for generation of particle populations required for modelling. The particle populations can be based on either assuming representative filler shapes such as rectangular or elliptical plates or by the Fourier series descriptor. Characterisation of dispersion coatings were also carried out. The dispersion coatings were formulated by styrene-butadiene latex and mixed with the selected clays at several filler volume fractions and applied on 160 ∙− 2 linerboards. The characterisation was based on the measurement of water vapour transmission rate (WVTR) and oxygen transmission rate (O 2 TR). The coating thickness was also measured by scanning electron microscopy image analysis. The WVTR and O 2 TR were shown to be sensitive to the type of filler, volume fraction of filler, and thickness of the coatings. Both the WVTR and O 2 TR tended to be lower as the filler size, filler volume fraction, and coating thickness increased. The thickness of the coating was found to be dependent on the coating process (coated rod), coating formulation, and its variability on the linerboard topography. The proposed model predicted the relative permeability based on the estimation of permeant flux by the Fick’s first law through three dimensional coating geometries. The coatings were filled with rectangular plates randomly located. These plates were defined by distribution curves of maximum Feret diameter, elongation, and thickness of the selected clays. The amount of fillers in the coating was determined by part of filler volume fractions used for measurements of WVTR and O 2 TR. The sizes of the geometries were defined by the representative elemental volume estimated from the filler volume fraction and the variation of the predictions. The geometries were generated by programming in Matlab under particular conditions of coating formulation and exposure. The mathematical solution of the model was carried out by finite element method and solved by Comsol Multiphysics. As expected from the experimental characterisation of the coatings, the predictions indicated that the relative permeability reduced as the volume fraction of filler and the size of the clay increased; however, overestimation of the barrier properties were predicted. To understand the reasons for the discrepancy, several factors, that were not included in the conceptual model, were analysed. It was observed that the filler agglomeration and uncoated areas was the most significant factor that may affect the prediction of the relative permeability. Other factors such the uniformity of coating profile, and filler shape were found to have an effect on the prediction. Despite the discrepancy, the model was suitable for prediction of how to improve barrier performance trend. Thus, it was possible to evaluate different factors related to the barrier performance to find their best combination. In order to optimise the formulation of barrier dispersion coatings, sensitivity analyses were carried out based on factors that affect the permeability. Filler settling in the coating or coatings with two layers were found to provide a reduction of relative permeability. This technique also may reduce the material used for coating preparation and the occurrence of uncoated areas. However, these effects were smaller than the effect of filler agglomeration on the barrier performance. For this reason, future studies should be focused on the improvement of dispersion of fillers in the coating binder. The application of the model in other coating formulations must consider the definitions of the concepts used in the study in order to apply the correct information for running simulations. Because this model was the first approach developed for dispersion coatings, several aspects were fully not explored in this study. In future research may be focused on the improvement of filler geometry characterisation, dispersion of fillers in the coating binder, incorporation of coating irregularities in the conceptual model, and incorporation of commercial coatings additives in the model. These points may increase the complexity of the model; however, it is expected that such complexity will be practical to be included in the model in the near future due to advances in computing capability for FEM simulations...|$|E
