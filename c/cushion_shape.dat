30|$|Based on this evidence, {{we report}} that the {{fusiform}} leaf cushions (represented by Lepidodendron wenquanensis or L. ninghsiaense) were the earliest during the Mississippian, then the rhomboidal (L. quadratum) and the inverted water-drop shape (L. volkmannianum) during the Late Mississippian. The trapeziform (Lepidodendron liulinense), horizontal rhombus (L. acutangulum) and hexagonal (L. hexagonum) leaf cushions appeared during the Pennsylvanian. The Permian species had the more diverse leaf cushions than the Carboniferous species, as a new, square shape (Lepidodendron hejinense) occurred beside older types (Fig. 6 b).

Pulvinus is euryhaline, growing and reproducing in salinities of 2 to 30 practical salinity units (psu). Monosporangia are formed successively by terminal branch cells or when a sector of a thallus gelatinises, releasing masses of spores. Monospores are round (6 – 10 �m diameter) and glide at speeds up to 4. 5 �m s� 1. Some monospores have an extracellular polysaccharide tail and move more slowly, 0. 25 to 1. 0 �m s� 1. Spores avoid contact with other objects and do not require substrate contact during movement. The ultrastructure of Pulvinus is very similar to that of Compsopogon and Boldia in that the cis-region of Golgi bodies is not associated with a mitochondrion and plastids have a peripheral thylakoid.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{influence}} of chair characteristics on comfort, discomfort, adjustment time and seat interface pressure is investigated during VDU and non-VDU tasks: The two investigated office chairs, both designed according to European and Dutch standards are different regarding: 1) seat <b>cushioning</b> and <b>shape,</b> 2) backrest angle and 3) controls. Thirty subjects in total, both male and female, participated in two experiments: twenty {{in the first and}} ten in the second. Significant differences are found for ease of adjustment and adjustment time of controls, independent of the tasks. Related to tasks, a significant difference was found for the backrest range of motion. For non-VDU tasks a larger range of backrest motion was preferred by 70 % of the subjects. The chair design differences were most clear for comfort and adjustment time of controls, followed by comfort of backrest angle.

40|$|In the Travelogue Sofa project, Neil {{explored}} {{the relationships between}} traditional and contemporary textile print methodologies. Digital print {{is often associated with}} mass production; however in this project the limitations of digital design software are pushed to new boundaries with multiple layer applications creating engineered pattern shapes for a one piece of furniture. Neil worked with the Upholstery Workshop in Broadstairs, which specialises in hand produced bespoke upholstered furniture. The Upholstery Workshop team has not previously worked with a textile designer who utilises digital engineered print technology. This proved to be an exciting creative dialogue as the textile design was developed alongside the construction of the framework and upholstery. This process allowed adaptions and changes to be made to both the sofa framework and to the textiles design. A central focus of the piece is a four-way pattern match, which presented the added complication of a pattern match to both visible and hidden areas of the textile design running around the 3 D <b>cushion</b> <b>shapes.</b> Accurate pattern cutting and multidirectional pattern matching, normally a skill acquired after years of upholstery apprentice, needed to be digitally mastered for this project. The need for accuracy required to allow for a seamless pattern match was extremely complex. Fabric shrinkage, movement and alignment tolerances had to be factored into the design process. For the Upholstery team this highlighted the differences of working with repeat off the roll fabrics and the digital engineered fabric. Working with placement or engineered printed fabric is more widely used in the fashion industry. Neil's research into computer aided design programmes has yielded surprising similarities to the hand crafted screen-printing techniques that he has developed for over twenty five years. In this respect, he explores the application of computer-aided design from a craft perspective but with the added flexibility that digital printing offers, such as the ability to alter scale, colour, layer order, intensity and layout more efficiently. The result is a unique object, which has been designed around the 3 D furniture form, encompassing both traditional crafted upholstery technique whilst developing a new level of expertise in the digital textiles design process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Previous {{research}} {{indicated that}} matching a <b>cushion</b> to the <b>shape</b> of the buttocks results in less tissue distortion and lower interface pressures. A system {{was developed to}} measure body contours and fabricate a cushion to match the measured contour. This project fabricated contoured foam cushions for 11 persons with spinal cord lesions (C 5 -L 3). Mean pressures were compared on two flat and two contoured foams with different degrees of stiffness. Deflection characteristics on flat foam were compared to deflection on contoured foam in order to analyze loading differences. Material studies were determined by examin-ing the load-deflection curves for flat foams of 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -inch thicknesses. It was found that sitting on contoured foam resulted in a lower pressure distribution than sitting on flat foam (p< 0. 05), and sitting on a soft foam (ILD= 45) resulted in a lower pressure distribution than sitting on a stiffer foam (ILD= 55) (p< 0. 05). Results of the deflection measurements and compres-sion tests were used to explain the loading differences at the seat interface of flat and contoured cushions. Loaded contoured foam demonstrated increased enveloping of the buttocks, decreased foam compression, and a more uniform pressure distribution. These attributes are typical of a safer sitting surface and may indicate less tissue distortion. Key words: custom contoured cushions, pressure ulcers, spinal cord injury, tissue interface pressure, wheelchair seating...|$|R
30|$|Many {{pedagogical}} {{accounts of}} breathing in brass players discuss {{the effect of}} different standing and sitting postures and though numerous opinions have been expressed about this (Frederiksen 1996; Gordon 1987; Snell 1988; Steenstrup 2004), none {{has so far been}} based on experimental evidence. It is often suggested that when standing, vital capacity is greater and breathing movements more free than when sitting i.e. that during inspiration particularly, they require less effort (Steenstrup 2004). If the player does use a chair, they are often instructed to sit “as if you are standing” (Frederiksen 1996) though they may be warned not to sit too erect (Farkas 1956). The type of chair used also has an effect on posture which can in turn have an impact on breathing. It is now quite common for orchestral musicians (including wind players), to play on seats that slope down towards the front in order to improve comfort, particularly when playing for long periods (Horvath 2010; Paull and Harrison 1997). While some modern orchestral chairs have been ergonomically designed to incorporate a degree of slope, the chairs that players are most often presented with do not, and they may therefore adapt them by using wedge <b>shaped</b> <b>cushions</b> or by putting blocks under the back legs. Sitting on a flat seat, reduces or even reverses lumbar lordosis and the rationale for using a sloping seat is the belief that this will restore lumbar curvature to a conformation that more closely resembles standing thus reducing intervertebral disk pressure (see Watson 2009). Whether this can be achieved with the degree of slope that can be readily attained on the platform is rarely discussed; furthermore there has been little consideration of what effect sloping seats might have on breathing. This is the object of the present investigation.|$|R
40|$|As {{automation}} technology {{continues to}} be integrated into industrial and mobile machinery, more precise control of hydraulic cylinders will assist in the achievement of desired response characteristics. Thus, in designing the cushioning mechanism for a hydraulic cylinder, there is value in predicting the deceleration response due to pressure generated when fluid passes through the cushion orifice. The cushion orifice can be designed to change {{as a function of}} piston position to meet a desired velocity response. In practice, determination of the orifice area requires a lengthy iterative process of trial and error. Therefore, to overcome these design process challenges, dynamic models of cylinder cushioning systems were developed that, when solved numerically, predicted the pressure and velocity responses of the cylinder with time. Utilizing these dynamic models, a cushion design optimization procedure was also developed to obtain the dimensions of the cushioning spear that most closely obtains the desired velocity response profile. Simulations of the dynamic cushion model were performed using a cushion spear with a shape designed through a static analysis to produce constant deceleration during the <b>cushioning</b> phase. Spear <b>shapes</b> were fit to the analytically developed common spear profile and their performance was assessed with simulation. The developed optimization procedure was run to compare the performance the spear shapes common to industry. Lastly, to identify the range of results produced by the optimizer, the procedure was run ten times for each spear type with the variation between runs. The performance of each run was quantified by measuring the root-mean square error (RMSE) between the desired velocity profile and the simulated velocity profile. When surrounding system conditions were held constant, the analytical analysis produced a profile leading to nearly constant deceleration with an RMSE of 1. 4 x 10 - 3 m/s (0. 29 feet per minute; fpm) when simulated by the dynamic model. However, attempts to replicate the results of the analytical model with common spear shapes resulted in deviation from the constant deceleration goal with the parabolic and linear regression curves producing RMSE values of 14. 9 x 10 - 3 and 21. 7 x 10 - 3 m/s (2. 94 and 4. 28 fpm) respectively. The optimizer produced a consistent family of results for each spear with an average standard deviation of 2. 6 x 10 - 3 m/s (0. 51 fpm). This dynamic modeling approach has potential to assist designers in the development of cushioning spears that meet customer cushion response specifications...|$|R
30|$|Publications {{dealing with}} the {{ergonomics}} of musical performance frequently discuss the use of chairs with sloping seats (Paull and Harrison 1997; Horvath 2010; Rosset i Llobet and Odam 2007). Diverse opinions on optimal sitting posture have been expressed in various orthopaedics texts (see Claus et al. 2009) though generally without reference to objective evidence, however {{it has been reported}} (Harrison et al. 1999; Keegan 1953) that an angle of 135 ° between the trunk and the thighs reduces the pull of the thigh muscles on the pelvis and allows the lumbar lordosis to assume what was defined as the neutral position (similar to that of standing). This angle would be impractical for musicians on a smooth seat as the buttocks would tend to slide downwards. Several types of ergonomic chair with downward sloping seats are commercially available (e.g. kneeling or saddle chairs). The seats of kneeling chairs may slope by as much as 20 ° (Bettany-Saltikov et al. 2008) creating an angle between the trunk and thighs of 110 °, while in saddle chairs in which a raised pommel-like central ridge prevents forward slippage of the body, the angle between trunk and thigh may exceed 125 ° (Gandavadi and Ramsay 2005). Kneeling chairs do restore a moderate degree of lordosis in comparison to the kyphosis that is a typical consequence of sitting on flat seats, but this remains well below that of erect standing (Bettany-Saltikov et al. 2008). Musicians sometimes adapt the chairs provided with by placing blocks under the back legs or using a wedge <b>shaped</b> <b>cushion</b> (Paull and Harrison 1997). The cushions typically have a slope of 11 – 22 degrees (representing a trunk to thigh angle of 101 – 112 degrees) but this likely to be reduced by compression when the player sits on them. Alternatively, the player may sit on the front edge of a flat seat, holding the trunk erect and allowing the thighs to slope downward, though the degree to which this is possible will depend on the relationship between seat height and leg length. A number of chairs designed specifically for musicians are also available. In most, the slope of the seat is quite modest though one has a maximum downward slope of about 15 ° (allowing a trunk to thigh angle of 105 °). In chairs with a gentler slope, rounding the front edge of the seat allows the thighs to slope more steeply when the player sits forward. When sitting erect on sloping seats, greater activity is required in the postural muscles of the back and so it make take time to acclimatise and strengthen them, particularly if there is no lumbar support (Claus et al. 2009; Gandavadi and Ramsay 2005). The degree of lordosis will depend on how erect the trunk is held by voluntary muscle activity. In orchestras, bands or other ensembles, performers often play sitting for several hours a day but unless they are physically active, core stability (dependent on distal limb and trunk musculature) may be relatively weak (Ackermann et al. 2002; Kava et al. 2010).|$|R
