The mode of reactivity of the electrolyte and the reversibility of the platinum charging of platinised layers (whatever the type of conducting substrate - gold and glassy carbon {{can also be used}} successfully) are discussed in terms {{of the nature of the}} salt. After cathodic charge and oxidation by air of samples removed from the cell, a huge change of morphology of the original platinised layer was observed. During repeated reduction/oxidation stages, the original amorphous platinised layer was progressively transformed, with a noticeable swelling of the original layer. This transformation, based essentially on <b>cathodic</b> <b>swelling</b> due to the peculiar reactivity of platinum in the presence of bulky tetraalkylammonium salts, is the precondition for a new kind of platinum interface...|$|E
