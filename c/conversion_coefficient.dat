Accordingly, {{various parts of the}} eye lens have different radio-sensitivities. Recently, some studies have been performed to develop a realistic eye model with the aim of providing accurate estimation of fluence-to-dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> for different parts of the eye. However, the effect of accommodation, which changes the lens shape and pupil size, on dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> has not been considered yet. In this study, we purport to develop an accommodation-dependent eye model and to study the effects of accommodation on the electron and proton fluence-to-dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Materials and Methods Herein, a modified eye model was developed by considering the effects of accommodation on the lens shape and pupil size. In addition, MCNPX 2. 6 Monte Carlo transport code was used to calculate the effects of  eye lens accommodation on electron and proton fluence-to-dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Results Calculation of dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> demonstrated that the accommodation causes up to 40 % discrepancy for fluence-to-dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> of electrons in the range of 600 to 800 keV, which is due to the change of eye lens shape during the accommodation of the eye. Conclusion Since the accommodation of the eye change the lens shape and pupil size, it has considerable effect on fluence-to-dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> of electrons at some ranges of incident particle energies that should be considered in simulation.

Dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> for photons, electrons and neutrons based on new ICRP recommendations were cited in the ICRP Publication 74, but the energy ranges of theses data were limited and there are no data for high energy radiations produced in accelerator facilities. For the purpose of designing the high intensity proton accelerator facilities at JAERI, the dose evaluation code system of high energy radiations based on the HERMES code was developed and the dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> of effective dose were evaluated for photons, neutrons and protons up to 10 GeV, and electrons up to 100 GeV. The dose <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> of effective dose equivalent were also evaluated using quality factors to consider the consistency between radiation weighting factors and Q-L relationship.

40|$|The {{personal}} dose equivalent, H{sub p}(d), is {{the quantity}} {{recommended by the}} International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) {{to be used as}} an approximation of the protection quantity Effective Dose when performing personal dosemeter calibrations. The personal dose equivalent can be defined for any location and depth within the body. Typically, the location of interest is the trunk where personal dosemeters are usually worn and in this instance a suitable approximation is a 30 cm X 30 cm X 15 cm slab-type phantom. For this condition the personal dose equivalent is denoted as H{sub p,slab}(d) and the depths, d, are taken to be 0. 007 cm for non-penetrating and 1 cm for penetrating radiation. In operational radiation protection a third depth, 0. 3 cm, is used to approximate the dose to the lens of the eye. A number of <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> for photons are available for incident energies up to several MeV, however, data to higher energies are limited. In this work <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficients</b> up to 1 GeV have been calculated for H{sub p,slab}(10) and H{sub p,slab}(3) using both the kerma approximation and by tracking secondary charged particles.

50|$|At {{this stage}} of the {{analysis}} {{it is important to know}} the internal conversion coefficients for the transitions connecting the known levels. The internal <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficient</b> is defined as the number of de-excitations via e− emission over those via γ emission. If internal conversion takes place, the EM multipole fields of the nucleus do not result in the emission of a photon, instead, the fields interact with the atomic electrons and cause one of the electrons to be emitted from the atom. The gamma that would be emitted after the beta decay is missed, and the γ intensity decreases accordingly: IT = Iγ + Ie− = Iγ(1 + αe), so this phenomenon has to be taken into account in the calculation. Also, the x rays will be contaminated with those coming from the electron conversion process. This is important in electron capture decay, as it can affect the results of any x-ray gated spectra if the internal conversion is strong. Its probability is higher for lower energies and high multipolarities.|$|E
40|$|We {{calculate}} the amplitude-to-phase (AM-to-PM) noise conversion in a modified unitraveling carrier (MUTC) photodetector. We obtained two nulls as {{measured in the}} experiments, and we explain their origin. The nulls appear due to the transit time variation when the average photocurrent varies, and the transit time variation {{is due to the}} change of electron velocity when the average photocurrent varies. We also show that the AM-to-PM <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficient</b> depends only on the pulse energy and is independent of the pulse duration when the duration is less than 500 fs. When the pulse duration is larger than 500 fs, the nulls of the AM-to-PM <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficient</b> shift to larger average photocurrents. This shift occurs because the increase in that pulse duration leads to a decrease in the peak photocurrent. The AM-to-PM noise <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficient</b> changes as the repetition rate varies. However, the repetition rate does not change the AM-to-PM <b>conversion</b> <b>coefficient</b> as a function of input optical pulse energy. The repetition rate changes the average photocurrent.
