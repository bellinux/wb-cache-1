Methods The survey was conducted in the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in China. A 20 -item questionnaire was developed and piloted over a period of eight weeks. Results 176 adult surgical inpatients completed the survey with a response rate of 98. 9 %. Only about one quarter of the participants had past experience of acupuncture treatment (n = 46, 26. 1 %) and one third thought acupuncture was effective (n = 61, 34. 7 %). Less than half of them were willing to use acupuncture for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (n = 70, 39. 8 %), postoperative pain (n = 79, 44. 9 %), preoperative anxiety and insomnia (n = 65, 36. 9 %), postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction (n = 76, 43. 2 %), postoperative urinary retention (n = 81, 46. 0 %).

40|$|This thesis proposes {{changes to}} the Golden Lane Estate in central London to {{integrate}} the public spaces within the estate with the surrounding city[M 1] .   The Golden[M 2]  Lane Estate is a modernist housing complex consisting of nine residential buildings with 564 flats. It was built as a council house project in 1952 - 1962 to satisfy the housing need after the Second World War.   Current observations show that the public spaces at the Golden Lane Estate are mostly empty and spread over different levels increasing the spatial separation. Residents use the large open spaces for transit to or from their flats and visitors are rarely attracted. The modernist layout, where few people share space {{in front of the}} entrances to their flats, have affected the perceived ownership of public space at Golden Lane. It is neither perceived as private nor fully public.   I have assumed that the residential buildings should stay intact. They are architecturally and historically valuable and serve their purpose well. The flats are popular and the estate was listed in 1992.   The Golden Lane Leisure Centre is situated {{in the middle of the}} estate. In the listing record it is described as a chief example of the architects’ belief that a housing development should not just be a collection of flats but a real part of the city; it provides welcome facilities for those who live outside the estate as well as for residents.   By reviving the Leisure Centre and turning unused garages into offices the two western public spaces are activated and restructured to be attractive to residents and visitors again. The revenue from the commercial spaces can finance an upgrade of the eastern public spaces to be a calm oasis where residents can realise their gardening dreams <b>or</b> <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> have their lunch. Today’s Golden Lane Estate can become a real part of the city with four attractive places adding value for residents, workers and visitors. ...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} examined attitudes towards older workers, the ageing workforce and computer training. The sample comprised 29 Canterbury employers and 140 trainees from the Training Opportunities Programmes (TOPS) aged 19 to 69. The Questionnaire survey of Canterbury Employers {{was designed to}} obtain information about the impact an ageing workforce may have on businesses, the value of older workers {{and the influence of}} computer training in the workplace, as this has been seen as a significant issue in the employability of older workers. The Questionnaire survey of TOPS Trainees was compiled to obtain information about trainees' views on work and computer training. Both questionnaires were sent to the participants by post. Results indicated that Canterbury employers (N= 29) did not envisage {{that there would be a}} significant impact on their organisations in the short term as a result of the ageing workforce, however, they expected positive influences of the ageing workforce on their organisations. Responses also showed that Canterbury employers valued the skills and attributes of their older workers and they were willing to provide computer training courses that were job-related. Older workers are regarded as having useful experiences, being loyal to the organisation, having low absenteeism and having a strong work ethic. Responses from TOPS trainees (N= 140) were divided into two groups: the older trainees (40 years of age and older) and the younger trainees (less than 40 years old). 84 % had previously been in full-time work. Older trainees had more work experiences, primarily as either labourers <b>or</b> <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> Findings indicated there was no significant difference between older and younger trainees on the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) in terms of psychological health. On the Work Aspect Preference Scale (WAPS), older and younger trainees differed significantly in the Life Style, which measures the effect that employment might have on where and how one lives, and Altruism, which measures a concern for assisting others. Although older trainees were found to have less computer experience than younger trainees did, they appeared to attend more computer training classes and generally had better attitudes towards computers...|$|R

Business teachers, entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers,</b> and employers were asked the following questions: 1. What occupational skills are performed by entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers?</b> 2. What level off education is needed for entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers?</b> 3. What are the reasons for selecting entry-level <b>office</b> <b>worker</b> applicants? 4. What are the reasons for not selecting entry-level <b>office</b> <b>worker</b> applicants? [...] - 5. What are the areas in which improvement should be made in the preparation of entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers?</b> 6. What are the causes for termination of entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> ? 7. What are the personal characteristics desired by employers for entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers?</b> 8.

What is the relationship between participation in on-the-job training programs and the job success of entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers?</b> 10. What types of methods are used in the selection of entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers?</b> 11. What further training is conducted by employers after hiring an entry-level <b>office</b> <b>worker?</b> Procedure The data for this study consisted of information obtained by questionnaires from vocational business teachers, entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers,</b> and employers of entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> Eighty percent of the 95 teachers surveyed responded, while 72 percent of the 232 businesses surveyed responded to the questionnaire. The data were then analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, Scheffe analysis, descriptive analysis and Chi-square programs. Principal Findings There is a difference between the perceptions of vocational business teachers, entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers,</b> and employers regarding employable qualifications for entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> in Utah. Teachers indicate a greater frequency and a greater importance for the skills than did employers or employees. However, they do agree on the most important skills and the least important skills. There was a discrepancy among the three groups regarding the skills which were ranked between most important and least important. Teachers gave more importance to skills such as shorthand, filing, and running duplicating machines, while employers and employees gave more emphasis to the skills which require some sort of decision making or human relations skill. The three groups agreed that entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> need to complete high school before securing a job and that some college training was advisable. Personality was given as the primary reason for selecting entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers,</b> while inability to communicate with employers was given as the primary reason for not hiring entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> Once hired, making costly mistakes continuously was the reason given by the three groups for termination of entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> Teachers viewed the ability to follow suggestions and instructions, employers the concern for productivity, and employees the ability to write and speak effectively as the areas most in need of improvement for entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> Interviewing was the most common method used by employers in selecting entry-level <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> Conclusion A continual evaluation of business education programs should occur to keep business education programs current with the changing demands of today 2 ̆ 7 s business world...|$|R

It did so through the adoption of the Charter of Rights and Freedom,in 1976, a passive legislation since it is based on complaints. It seems {{to be a matter of}} time before the Québec Government passes a pro-active legislation on pay equity and, in doing so, it will likely draw its inspiration from the Pay Equity Act(PEA) passed by the Ontario Government in 1987. One of PEA important feature is the emphasis on institutional structures and practices in determining the appropriate unit for the purpose of achieving pay equity. In practice, such units will often match up with the usual job families (e. g. <b>clerical</b> <b>or</b> <b>office</b> vs production jobs). However, the historical development of jobs families is intertwined with the evolution of occupational segregation between men and women in the labour markets. This paper looks at the results of two methods of making pay comparisons between predominantly female and predominantly male jobs: the "job to job" approach, designed in a way similar to the provisions of the PEA in Ontario and the "job to line" approach, a more comprehensive one. The results are drawn from the analysis of data from 24 public and private organizations (excluding provincial and federal public sectors) in the province of Québec, with 100 or more employees and having both office and non <b>office</b> (production <b>or</b> maintenance) job families. All these organizations already used job evaluation as part of their wage determination process. The value of each job was established by using a point factor, gender-neutral job evaluation plan. Various regression analysis were conducted to check for and measure wage discrimination. Among the 24 organizations, 17 (or 70 %) were found to have wage differentials related to sex between office female jobs and all male jobs. Wage differentials are said gender biased if associated with differences in the sex composition of jobs or jobs families. The average hourly wage differential amounted to 14 %. Results from the two methods of wage comparisons, that is job to job versus job to line comparisons, show that the latter raises the number of predominantly female office jobs to be adjusted under a pay equity operation especially in the larger organizations. There does not appear to be any significant difference however between mean wage adjustments produced by one method or the othe...|$|R

40|$|Aim The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review is to evaluate the physical activity time (PAT) of white collar <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> {{in order to assess}} the levels of sedentary activity in an office environment. Analysing the <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> PAT will not only allow an insight into how an office based job could impact a person’s overall health and wellness status, but will also allow for the development of future office based inter ventions aimed at increasing the overall physical activity among white collar <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> Methodology Using the PRISMA 2009 guidelines a literature review was conducted to assess the PAT of <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> and the typical sedentary nature of their work could affect their health. The review consisted of 8 peer reviewed studies, collected through the entry of 9 initial search terms relating to the physical activity, sedentariness and overall health of white collar workers into Discovery, PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. Results Results suggesting low physical activity time spent among white collar <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> with the average minutes spent sedentary on a working day mean(±SD), (529 ± 75. 3), minutes in light activity, (164. 9 ± 51. 1) and vigorous activity time, (28. 2 ± 15. 9). Low levels of physical activity were also found during non working days with the average sedentary time being mean (±SD), (460. 1 ± 63. 2), minutes in light physical activity, (251. 2 ± 102. 1), and moderate to vigorous physical activity time (MVPA) time, (17. 9 ± 29. 3).

According to the Texas Workforce Commission, <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> represent up to 40 % of the workforce in Texas and the general nature {{of the type of}} work is sedentary. Additional study is needed on how the built environment near the worksite area impacts walking behaviors and to determine interventions effective in increasing walking as part of daily routines among <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> The two aims of this dissertation were: 1) investigate the differences that urban and suburban settings may have on walking behavior (walk trips, walk duration, total step count) of <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> in Texas and 2) to examine the impact of a simple intervention in increasing walking within the respective land use settings. This study utilized on-line survey and travel diary, pedometer, and Geographic Information System to capture the study variables, which included personal, social and cultural, organizational, and built environmental factors. Results showed that urban <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> walk, on average, 600 steps more per day than the suburban <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> <b>Office</b> <b>workers</b> in both land use settings on average have not met the recommended level of walking steps per day of 10, 000 steps per day (Urban Mean= 4, 932 steps per day, Suburban Mean= 4, 347 steps per day). Post-intervention step count averaged 5, 734 steps per day for urban <b>office</b> <b>workers</b> in contrast to 4, 257 steps per day for suburban <b>office</b> <b>workers.</b> This translated to a 16 % increase and 2 % decrease in walking steps for urban and suburban <b>office</b> <b>workers,</b> respectively.
