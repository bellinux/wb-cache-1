These needs set the function of such a system apart from scientific/research monitoring of GHGs and carbon-cycle systems, and include (not exclusively) : {{the need for a}} GHGIS that is operational, as required for decision-support; the need for a system that meets specifications derived from imposed requirements; the need for rigorous <b>calibration,</b> <b>verification,</b> and validation (CV&V) standards, processes, and records for all measurement and modeling/data-inversion data; the need to develop and adopt an uncertainty-quantification (UQ) regimen for all measurement and modeling data; and the requirement that GHGIS products can be subjected to third-party questioning and scientific scrutiny. This report examines and assesses presently available capabilities that could contribute to a future GHGIS. These capabilities include sensors and measurement technologies; data analysis and data uncertainty quantification (UQ) practices and methods; and model-based data-inversion practices, methods, and their associated UQ.

40|$|The {{three main}} methodologies {{applied to the}} problem of signal {{validation}} and <b>calibration</b> <b>verification</b> are Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Neural Network Partial Least Squares (NNPLS), and the Multivariate State Estimation Technique (MSET). The abilities of each of these techniques to sufficiently estimate an instrument channel's measurements has been shown in publications and presentations by numerous researchers. The estimation accuracies of these methods for different applications are consistently similar; in some cases one method is superior in this respect, while in another case a different model is superior, such that no single method has been proven to be the best for all applications. Another important consideration in applying these methodologies is the quantification of uncertainty bounds on their resultant estimations. Moreover, a direct comparison of these uncertainty bounds for a real data set has not been performed. It is this consideration that is becoming the most important issue recently while the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Electric Power Research Institute are moving towards implementing signal validation and <b>calibration</b> <b>verification</b> systems into existing nuclear power plants {{to reduce the number of}} required calibrations. The obvious benefits of reduced costs, personnel radiation exposure, equipment damage risks, among others, are the motivating factors behind this movement. The focus of this work is to provide a direct comparison of point-wise confidence intervals for each of the three methodologies.

40|$|ABSTRACT. USEPA’s water program {{staff and}} their {{counterparts}} in state pollution control agencies increasingly emphasize watershed and water quality−based assessment and integrated analysis of point and nonpoint sources of pollution. BASINS 3. 0 (Better Assessment Science Integrating point and Nonpoint Sources) is a system developed {{to meet the needs}} of such agencies. This study was conducted to evaluate the major watershed−scale models, SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program − Fortran), included within the BASINS 3. 0 system. SWAT and HSPF were calibrated and verified with data from the Upper North Bosque River watershed (UNBRW), an intense dairy producing region located in central Texas. The model output was calibrated for daily flow, sediment, and nutrients measured at five stream sites within the UNBRW for the period of January 1994 through June 1995 and verified (daily and monthly time−step) for the period of July 1995 to July 1999. Nash−Sutcliffe model efficiency (E) and mean error (ME) were used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. The average daily flow, sediment, and nutrient loading simulated by SWAT were closer to measured values than HSPF during both <b>calibration</b> and <b>verification</b> periods at the outlet of UNBRW. As indicated by E values, the temporal variations of daily flow (E = 0. 72 and 0. 70 for HSPF, while E = 0. 17 and 0. 62 for SWAT during the <b>calibration</b> and <b>verification,</b> respectively) and sediment (E = 0. 11 and 0. 23 for HSPF, while E = − 2. 50 and − 3. 51 for SWAT during the <b>calibration</b> and <b>verification,</b> respectively) were better described by HSPF during the <b>calibration</b> and <b>verification</b> periods.
