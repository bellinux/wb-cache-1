50|$|Traditionally, large shippers build {{factories}} and warehouses near rail lines {{and have a}} section of track on their property called a siding where goods are loaded onto or unloaded from rail cars. Other shippers have their goods hauled (drayed) by wagon or truck to or from a goods station (freight station in US). Smaller locomotives transfer the rail cars from the sidings and goods stations to a <b>classification</b> <b>yard,</b> where each car is coupled to one of several long distance trains being assembled there, depending on that car's destination. When long enough, or based on a schedule, each long distance train is then dispatched to another <b>classification</b> <b>yard.</b> At the next <b>classification</b> <b>yard,</b> cars are resorted. Those that are destined for stations served by that yard are assigned to local trains for delivery. Others are reassembled into trains heading to <b>classification</b> <b>yards</b> closer to their final destination. A single car might be reclassified or switched in several yards before reaching its final destination, a process that made rail freight slow and increased costs. Many freight rail operators are trying to reduce these costs by reducing or eliminating switching in <b>classification</b> <b>yards</b> through techniques such as unit trains and containerization. In many countries, railroads have been built to haul one commodity, such as coal or ore, from an inland point to a port.|$|R
