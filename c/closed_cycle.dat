The conventional methods have several drawbacks: a new function must be defined for each task, the extended Jacobian can be singular, <b>closed</b> <b>cycles</b> in Cartesian space may not yield <b>closed</b> <b>cycles</b> in joint space, and the objective is point-wise redundancy resolution (to determine a single point in joint space for each point in Cartesian space). The author divides the redundancy resolution problem into two parts: (1) calculate self-motion coordinates for all possible positions of a manipulator at each point along a Cartesian path and (2) determination of optimal self-motion coordinates that maximize an objective function along the path. This paper will discuss {{the first part of}} the problem.

25|$|A Stirling {{engine is}} a heat engine that {{operates}} by cyclic compression {{and expansion of}} air or other gas (the working fluid) at different temperatures, such {{that there is a}} net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. More specifically, the Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanently gaseous working fluid. Closed-cycle, in this context, means a thermodynamic system in which the working fluid is permanently contained within the system, and regenerative describes the use of a specific type of internal heat exchanger and thermal store, known as the regenerator. The inclusion of a regenerator differentiates the Stirling engine from other <b>closed</b> <b>cycle</b> hot air engines.|$|E
25|$|Robert Stirling was a Scottish {{minister}} {{who invented the}} first practical example of a <b>closed</b> <b>cycle</b> air engine in 1816, and it was suggested by Fleeming Jenkin as early as 1884 that all such engines should therefore generically be called Stirling engines. This naming proposal found little favour, and the various types on the market continued to be known {{by the name of}} their individual designers or manufacturers, e.g., Rider's, Robinson's, or Heinrici's (hot) air engine. In the 1940s, the Philips company was seeking a suitable name for its own version of the 'air engine', which by that time had been tested with working fluids other than air, and decided upon 'Stirling engine' in April 1945. However, nearly thirty years later, Graham Walker still had cause to bemoan the fact such terms as 'hot air engine' remained interchangeable with 'Stirling engine', which itself was applied widely and indiscriminately; a situation that continues.|$|E

The <b>closed</b> fuel <b>cycle</b> hardly affects short-term spent fuel management but can save nearly 60 % space of interim storage compared with the open fuel cycle. Compared with the open fuel cycle, the accumulated volume of HLW can be significantly reduced in the <b>closed</b> fuel <b>cycle</b> up to over 95 % in 2100. For this volume reduction, high heat generating fission products should be separated from transuranic waste in pyroprocessing and stored in decay storages for a few hundred years.

2500|$|Since the Stirling {{engine is}} a <b>closed</b> <b>cycle,</b> it {{contains}} a fixed mass of gas called the [...] "working fluid", most commonly air, hydrogen or helium. In normal operation the engine is sealed and no gas enters or leaves the engine. No valves are required, unlike other types of piston engines. The Stirling engine, like most heat engines, cycles through four main processes: cooling, compression, heating and expansion. This is accomplished by moving the gas {{back and forth between}} hot and cold heat exchangers, often with a regenerator between the heater and cooler. The hot heat exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat source, such as a fuel burner, and the cold heat exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat sink, such as air fins. A change in gas temperature causes a corresponding change in gas pressure, while the motion of the piston causes the gas to be alternately expanded and compressed.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the turbine}} exit, the working fluid enters the {{condenser}} where it rejects heat, -Q, {{to the cold}} sea water. The condensate is then compressed to the highest pressure in the cycle, requiring condensate pump work, W. Thus, the Anderson <b>closed</b> <b>cycle</b> is a Rankine-type cycle similar to the conventional power plant steam cycle except that in the Anderson cycle the working fluid is never superheated {{more than a few}} degrees Fahrenheit. Owing to viscous effects, working fluid pressure drops in both the evaporator and the condenser. This pressure drop, which depends on the types of heat exchangers used, must be considered in final design calculations but is ignored here to simplify the analysis. Thus, the parasitic condensate pump work, W, computed here will be lower than if the heat exchanger pressure drop was included. The major additional parasitic energy requirements in the OTEC plant are the cold water pump work, W, and the warm water pump work, W. Denoting all other parasitic energy requirements by W, the net work from the OTEC plant, W is ...|$|E
