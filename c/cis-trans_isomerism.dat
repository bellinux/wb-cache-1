5|$|Structural {{effects can}} also be important. The {{difference}} between fumaric acid and maleic acid is a classic example. Fumaric acid is (E)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid, a trans isomer, whereas maleic acid is the corresponding cis isomer, i.e. (Z)-1,4-but-2-enedioic acid (see <b>cis-trans</b> <b>isomerism).</b> Fumaric acid has pKa values of approximately 3.0 and 4.5. By contrast, maleic acid has pKa values of approximately 1.5 and 6.5. The reason for this large difference is that when one proton {{is removed from the}} cis isomer (maleic acid) a strong intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed with the nearby remaining carboxyl group. This favors the formation of the maleate H+, and it opposes the removal of the second proton from that species. In the trans isomer, the two carboxyl groups are always far apart, so hydrogen bonding is not observed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{organometallic}} {{chemistry of}} platinum covers a huge field, {{as shown by}} a recent survey covering the crys-tallographic and structural data of almost one thousand organometallic derivatives. About nine percent of those deriva-tives exist as isomers and are summarized in this review and include distortion (90 %), cis- trans (6 %) and ligand isomer-ism (4 %). These are {{discussed in terms of}} the coordination about the platinum atom, and correlations are drawn between donor atom, bond length and interbond angles, with attention to any trans- effect. Distortion isomers, differing only by degree of distortion in Pt-L bond lengths and L- Pt-L bond angles, are the most nu-merous. They are also spread over a wider range of oxidation states of platinum, (zero, + 1, + 2, + 4, mixed valence + 1 plus + 2 and + 2 plus + 4), compared to <b>cis-trans</b> and ligand <b>isomerism</b> in which only + 2 is found...|$|R
25|$|Arachidonic acid (AA) has double {{bonds between}} carbons 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, and 14-15; these double bonds {{are in the}} cis (see <b>Cis–trans</b> <b>isomerism</b> or Z {{as opposed to the}} trans or E configuration. ALOX15 adds a hydroperoxy residue to AA at carbons 15 {{and to a lesser extent}} 12 to from 15(S)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HpETE) and 12(S)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E, 15S-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HpETE); the {{purified}} enzyme makes 15(S)-HpETE and 12(S)-HpETE in a product ratio of ~4-9 to 1. Both products may be rapidly reduced by ubiquitous cellular Glutathione peroxidase enzymes to their corresponding hydroxy analogs, 15(S)-HETE (see 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) and 12(S)-HETE (see 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE bind to and activate the Leukotriene B4 receptor 2, activate the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and at high concentrations cause cells to generate toxic reactive oxygen species; one or more of these effects may be at least in part responsible for their ability to promote inflammatory responses, alter the growth of various times of human cancer cell lines, contract various types of blood vessels, and stimulate pathological fibrosis in pulmonary arteries and liver (see 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid#15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE). 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE are esterified into membrane phospholipids where they may be stored and subsequently released during cell stimulation. As one aspect of this processing, the two products are progressively esterified in mitochondria membrane phospholipids during the maturation of red blood cells (see erythropoiesis) and thereby may serve to signal for the degradation of the mitochondria and the maturation of these precursors to red blood cells in mice. This pathway operates along with two other mitochondria-removing pathways and therefore does not appear essential for mouse red blood cell maturation.|$|E

Its IUPAC name, (5S,6E,8Z,11Z,14Z)-5-hydroxyicosa-6,8,11,14-tetraenoic acid, defines 5(S)-HETE's structure unambiguously by notating not only its S-hydroxyl chirality but also the <b>cis-trans</b> <b>isomerism</b> geometry for each of its 4 double bonds; E signifies trans and Z signifies cis double bond geometry.

50|$|The type of bonding can be {{explained}} in terms of orbital hybridization. In ethylene each carbon atom has three sp2 orbitals and one p-orbital. The three sp2 orbitals lie in a plane with ~120° angles. The p-orbital is perpendicular to this plane. When the carbon atoms approach each other, two of the sp2 orbitals overlap to form a sigma bond. At the same time, the two p-orbitals approach (again in the same plane) and together they form a pi-bond. For maximum overlap, the p-orbitals have to remain parallel, and, therefore, rotation around the central bond is not possible. This property gives rise to <b>cis-trans</b> <b>isomerism.</b> Double bonds are shorter than single bonds because p-orbital overlap is maximized.|$|E

50|$|EETS are epoxide eicosatrienoic acid {{metabolites}} of {{arachidonic acid}} (a straight chain Eicosatetraenoic acid, omega-6 fatty acid).

These double bonds are located between carbons 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, and 14-15; arachidonic acid is therefore 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases attack these double bonds {{to form their}} respective eicosatrienoic acid epoxide regioisomers (see Structural isomer, section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)) viz., 5,6-EET (i.e. 5,6-epoxy-8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid), 8,9-EET (i.e. 5,6-epoxy-8Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid), 11,12-EET (i.e. 11,12-epoxy-5Z,8Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid), or, as drawn in the attached figure, 14,15-EET (i.e. 14,15-epoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z-eicosatrienoic acid).

Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases attack any one of these double bounds to form a respective docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) epoxide regioisomer (see Structural isomer, section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)). A given epoxygenase may therefore convert DHA to 4,5-EDP (i.e. 4,5-epoxy-7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-DPA), 7,8-EDP (i.e. 7,8-epoxy-4Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-DPA), 10,11-EDP (i.e. 10,11-epoxy-4Z,7Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-DPA), 13,14-EDP (i.e. 13,14-epoxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,16Z,19Z-DPA), 16,17-EDP (i.e. 16,17-epoxy-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,19Z-DPA, or 19,20-EDP (i.e. 19,20-epoxy-4Z, 7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z-DPA.
