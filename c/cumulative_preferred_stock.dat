That same year, the railroad also acquired several steamboat companies; namely the Maryland, Choptank and Eastern Shore Steamboat Companies, all of Baltimore, Md. for $1.7 million in waterline property, wharves and equipment. In 1902, the Pennsylvania railroad became the majority stockholder but the BC&A still operated under its organization. [...] As of 1915, the railroad {{consisted of a}} single-track, standard-gage railroad, with distance of about 87 miles, with a branch line about 0.5 mile long extending from Salisbury to Fulton, Md., making a total of 87.252 miles. It also owned 15.582 miles of yard and side tracks. The new, combined operations of the BC&A in railroad and waterlines had been profitable with $0.5 million in profit on a total investment of $4.325 million with a total revenue of $17.8 million {{for the period of}} 1894 - 1915 and controlled by the Pennsylvania railroad as majority stockholder. Dividends were paid on $1.5 million par value of 5 per cent <b>cumulative</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> but none were paid on the common stock of $1.0 million [...] and none paid on the preferred stock after 1912. By 1921, the railroad had turned unprofitable due in part to private autos and trucks to the point where in March, 1922, it stopped making payments on its first mortgage. In 1921, the Pennsylvania railroad had to provide financial assistance in order for BC&A to make payments due under its first mortgage. This continued intermittently until 1926 when the Pennsylvania announced it was unwilling to continue this assistance. The following year, the trustee for the first mortgage, Chatham National Bank & Trust Co. of NY filed for foreclosure. The railroad was sold on March 29, 1928 to Charles Carter, representing Pennsylvania railroad interests and reorganized as the Baltimore and Eastern railroad, entirely owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad.|$|E

50|$|The main {{benefit to}} owning <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> {{is that the}} {{investor}} has a greater claim on the company’s assets than common stockholders.

5000|$|<b>Preferred</b> <b>stock</b> can be <b>cumulative</b> or noncumulative. A <b>cumulative</b> <b>preferred</b> {{requires}} {{that if a}} company fails to pay a dividend (or pays less than the stated rate), it must {{make up for it}} at a later time. Dividends accumulate with each passed dividend period (which may be quarterly, semi-annually or annually).

I find evidence that the association of <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> with credit analysts' assessments of credit risk depends on two factors. First, the association of <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> with credit ratings varies by the type of <b>preferred</b> <b>stock.</b> <b>Preferred</b> <b>stock</b> that is redeemable is negatively associated with credit ratings, while nonredeemable <b>preferred</b> <b>stock</b> bears no consistent association with credit ratings.
