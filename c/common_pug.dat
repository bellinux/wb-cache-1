50|$|Campanula {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species {{including}} <b>Common</b> <b>Pug</b> (recorded on Harebell), Dot Moth, Ingrailed Clay (recorded on Harebell), Lime-speck Pug and Mouse Moth.|$|E
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>pug</b> (Eupithecia vulgata) is a moth of {{the family}} Geometridae. It is a common species across the Palearctic region, the Near East and North Africa. It ranges from the Atlantic coast of Ireland and Portugal across Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia to the Russian Far East (Priamurje) and Korea.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 11-16 mm. The moth flies from April to October {{depending on}} the location. There is one generation per year. It {{is very similar to}} the more <b>common</b> foxglove <b>pug</b> but flies earlier in the year, has a much darker (often almost black) abdomen band, a sharper angled outer edge to the dark forewing band, and is cleaner and often brighter looking in colouration.|$|R
500|$|Eye {{prolapse}} is a <b>common</b> problem among <b>Pugs</b> {{and other}} brachycephalic breeds (see Brachycephalic syndrome) {{and can be}} caused by a trauma to the head or neck, or even by the owner using a tight leash instead of a harness. [...] While the eye can usually be pushed back into its socket by the owner or by a vet, veterinary attention is usually advisable. If the prolapse happens on a regular basis, the Pug might require surgery.|$|R
