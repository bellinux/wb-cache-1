It prescribes monetary penalties against any person who imports, attempts to import, or aids or procures the importation of merchandise by means of false or fraudulent documents, statements, omissions or practices, concerning any material fact. Penalties may be applied even in situations {{where there is no}} loss of revenue.|$|E
40|$|The {{world of}} {{international}} trade has evolved over the centuries and, with this process of evolution, unique challenges have emerged over time. International trade, in essence, involves the movement {{of goods and services}} across borders; it is conducted mainly by private firms rather than governments. The suggested role of government is to create an environment that allows for efficient international trade. Such an environment is manifested in the provision of an adequate physical infrastructure and a transparent regulatory environment. Today, an organisation such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), whose members direct the vast bulk {{of international trade}}, plays an active role in advancing the agenda of a rules-based international trade regime. This same organization also provides, on an ongoing basis, initiatives directed to improving the facilitation of trade internationally. Examples of trade facilitation initiatives are the recent Bali-Agreement (The Trade Facilitation Agreement, 2013), signed by WTO members in 2013 in Bali, and the Revised Kyoto Convention of the World Customs Organization (WCO) which has, as its objective, the elimination of barriers to efficient international trade. This dissertation focuses on <b>customs</b> <b>penalty</b> regime as utilised by South Africa. The South African regime is compared with certain foreign and international <b>customs</b> <b>penalty</b> regimes (in this case, Canada, the United States of America and the European Union). The study further explores the appeal system available to transgressors of these regimes. The penalty - and appeal regimes is further analysed against recommendations and prescripts in international agreements to which these countries are parties, specifically the WTO Bali Agreement and the WCO Revised Kyoto Convention. A practical and transparent <b>customs</b> <b>penalty</b> regime will obviously support the agenda to improve trade facilitation, a situation that is desired by traders throughout the globe...|$|E
50|$|In {{the interim}} Funke {{refused to pay}} the pecuniary penalty for {{non-compliance}} and in January 1985 a garnishment notice was served to retrieve 10,750 FRF from Funke's bank account, covering fines for May-December 1984. He contested this decision at the Strasbourg District Court in March 1985. That court upheld the notice but Funke appealed. In February 1989 the Colmar Court of Appeal reversed {{the decision of the}} district court and removed the notice. The custom authorities appealed this decision on points of law to the Court of Cassation, which upheld the decision that a garnishment notice could not be used for <b>customs</b> <b>penalties.</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel approach to modeling the transmembrane spanning helical bundles of integral membrane proteins using only a sparse set of distance constraints, such as those derived from MS 3 -D, dipolar-EPR and FRET experiments. Algorithms have been written for searching the conformational space of membrane protein folds matching the set of distance constraints, which provides initial structures for local conformational searches. Local conformation search is achieved by optimizing these candidates against a <b>custom</b> <b>penalty</b> function that incorporates both measures derived from statistical analysis of solved membrane protein structures and distance constraints obtained from experiments. This results in refined helical bundles to which the interhelical loops and amino acid side-chains are added. Using a set of only 27 distance constraints extracted from the literature, our methods successfully recover the structure of dark-adapted rhodopsin to within 3. 2 {angstrom} of the crystal structure...|$|R
50|$|Goods {{produced}} in Israeli settlements {{are able to}} stay competitive on the global market, {{in part because of}} massive state subsidies they receive from the Israeli government. Farmers and producers are given state assistance, while companies that set up in the territories receive tax breaks and direct government subsidies. An Israeli government fund has also been established to help companies pay <b>customs</b> <b>penalties.</b> Palestinian officials estimate that settlers sell goods worth some $500 million to the Palestinian market. Israel has built 16 industrial zones, containing roughly 1000 industrial plants, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem on acreage that consumes large parts of the territory planned for a future Palestinian state. According to Jodi Rudoren these installations both entrench the occupation and provide work for Palestinians, even those opposed to it. The 16 parks are located at Shaked, Beka'ot, Baran, Karnei Shomron, Emmanuel, Barkan, Ariel, Shilo, Halamish, Ma'ale Efraim, Sha'ar Binyamin, Atarot, Mishor Adumim, Gush Etzion, Kiryat Arba and Metarim (2001).|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} two-step {{approach}} to modeling the transmembrane spanning helical bundles of integral membrane proteins using only sparse distance constraints, {{such as those}} derived from chemical cross-linking, dipolar EPR and FRET experiments. In Step 1, using an algorithm, we developed, the conformational space of membrane protein folds matching a set of distance constraints is explored to provide initial structures for local conformational searches. In Step 2, these structures refined against a <b>custom</b> <b>penalty</b> function that incorporates both measures derived from statistical analysis of solved membrane protein structures and distance constraints obtained from experiments. We begin by describing the statistical analysis of the solved membrane protein structures from which the theoretical portion of the penalty function was derived. We then describe the penalty function, and, using a set of six test cases, demonstrate that {{it is capable of}} distinguishing helical bundles that are close to the native bundle from those that are far from the native bundle. Finally, using a set of only 27 distance constraints extracted from the literature, we show that our method successfully recovers the structure of dark-adapted rhodopsin to within 3. 2 Å of the crystal structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{dissertation}} was the elaboration, confirmation and acceptance, de lege lata and lege ferenda, that the subjective condition for the imposition of the tax and <b>custom</b> administrative <b>penalties</b> in Greek law is demanded. The subjective prerequisite is referred as the principle ‘’nulla poena sine culpa’’. At the same time, the {{object of the}} dissertation was to produce the arguments for the acceptance of the ‘’nulla poena sine culpa’’ principle as a democratic demand according to the ‘’rule of law’’ principle. The writing method of the dissertation is based on the reasoning model thesis - antithesis. Also, {{it is based on the}} approach of the principle ‘’nulla poena sine culpa’’ in the framework of every law provision in force in the Greek state, irrelevantly of the legislative body of the provision as national, international or supra - national. The ‘’nulla poena sine culpa’’ principle in the Greek tax and custom law bases mainly on articles 2 par. 1, 20 par. 1 and 2, 25 par. 1 subpar. d of the Greek Constitution and on the ‘’rule of law’’ principle, on the European Union’s Law, on the European Convention of Human Rights, mainly article 6, also in connection with the theory of ‘’criminal law lato sensu’’. The ‘’nulla poena sine culpa’’ principle is opposed to the ‘’rule of formality’’, which the Greek theory and courts reiterate for the rejection of the subjective condition. In the dissertation there is an extensive analysis of Greek case - law, that accepts and implements the ‘’nulla poena sine culpa’’ principle in that special administrative penalty field. After having established the theoretical base of the principle, in the last part of the dissertation it is confirmed that the principle ‘’nulla poena sine culpa’’ is in force in the Greek tax and <b>custom</b> administrative <b>penalty</b> law, as it has been introduced by the Greek legislator, considering also the respective implementation of it by the courts and the administration authorities. The conclusions of the dissertation are that : a) the ’’nulla poena sine culpa’’ principle is accepted and is in force in the Greek law of tax and <b>custom</b> administrative <b>penalties</b> and, b), however, more ‘’flexible’’, compared to the criminal sanctions, subjective conditions may be accepted for the imposition of this category of penalties. Finally, there is a proposal for the acceptance of the ‘’nulla poena sine culpa’’ principle as an acquired right in the Greek law, also for the ex-officio court verification, whether the infringement of the ‘’nulla poena sine culpa’’ principle in the field of tax and <b>custom</b> administrative <b>penalty</b> law constitutes a contradiction to the Constitution. ...|$|R
5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: an in rem suit against the ship, and an in personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the <b>custom,</b> any <b>penalties</b> assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{spectral}} correlation-based technique for tracking the wavelength shift of a fiber Bragg grating. We compared this approach, {{by means of}} a Monte Carlo numerical simulation, to the typical peak tracking techniques applied in classic interrogation systems. As result, we obtained a considerable gain in terms of noise tolerance (about 20 dB), which can be further incremented by selecting large-bandwidth gratings. This permits to increase the power budget of a fiber Bragg grating interrogator without changing the optical layout, overcoming classical limitations of commercial and <b>custom</b> systems. <b>Penalties</b> due to the non-idealities have been evaluated through the same Monte Carlo approach. Finally, we discuss a practical application of the peak tracking techniques to a fiber Bragg grating-based weight sensor, in which we applied the spectral correlation to track both the Bragg wavelength position, spectral deformations due to high strain, and spectral non-linearit...|$|R
