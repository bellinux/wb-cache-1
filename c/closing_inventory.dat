40|$|We {{examine how}} the {{intrinsic}} differences between U. S. and non-U. S. stocks affect market participants and the market quality of non-U. S. stocks relative to U. S. stocks. Using proprietary data on NYSE specialist trading, we find that, all else equal, specialist <b>closing</b> <b>inventory</b> positions for non-U. S. stocks are closer to zero than U. S. stocks. The evidence on specialist participation and stabilization rates is mixed. Non-U. S. stocks from developed markets have higher specialist participation and stabilization rates than U. S. stocks, while emerging market stocks have lower participation and stabilization rates than U. S. stocks. With respect to market quality, we find that, all else equal, non-U. S. stocks have wider spreads, less depth, and greater transitory volatility than U. S. stocks. We investigate the reasons behind the difference in liquidity and find that the larger non-U. S. spreads are primarily due to higher information asymmetry and increased adverse selection risk. We conclude that liquidity providers demand greater compensation for trading non-U. S. stocks, but this additional compensation is necessary to offset the higher adverse selection risk. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the multi-period single-item inventory lot-sizing problem with stochastic demands under the ‘‘static–dynamic uncertainty’ ’ strategy of Bookbinder and Tan (Manage. Sci. 34 (1988) 1096). In the static-dynamic uncertainty strategy, the replenishment periods are fixed {{at the beginning}} of the planning horizon, but the actual orders are determined only at those replenishment periods and will depend upon the demand that is realised. Their solution heuristic was a two-stage process of firstly fixing the replenishment periods and then secondly determining what adjustments should be made to the planned orders as demand was realised. We present a mixed integer programming formulation that determines both in a single step giving the optimal solution for the ‘‘static–dynamic uncertainty’’ strategy. The total expected inventory holding, ordering and direct item costs during the planning horizon are minimised under the constraint that the probability that the <b>closing</b> <b>inventory</b> in each time period will not be negative is set to at least a certain value. This formulation includes the effect of a unit variable purchase/production cost, which was excluded by the two-stage Bookbinder–Tan heuristic. An evaluation of the accuracy of the heuristic against the optimal solution for the case of a zero unit purchase/production cost is made for a wide variety of demand patterns, coefficients of demand variability and relative holding cost to ordering cost ratios. The practical constraint of nonnegative orders and the existence of the unit variable cost mean that the replenishment cycles cannot be treated independently and so the problem cannot be solved as a stochastic form of the Wagner–Whitin problem, applying th...|$|E

Self-enhancement was negatively related to secure attachment and positively related to dismissing attachment. The opposite pattern emerged for self-insight. A subgroup of 12 vulnerable individuals who described themselves as securely attached on self-report was judged as dismissing according to interview assessment. These individuals scored low on self-insight and high on self-enhancement and psychological vulnerability.

40|$|DTS is an {{oil and gas}} {{services}} company that delivers drilling tools to six major customer districts in the continental U. S. After the tools are used at a rig, they are transported to the closest repair and maintenance (MTC) facility in either Colorado (CO) or Oklahoma (OK) where they are disassembled and reconditioned for use on a future job. The tools are modular and require custom assembly and programming, depending on {{the requirements of the}} well. On occasion, DTS receives urgent orders for drilling tools to replace failed tools or to cater to unexpected demand. These urgent orders are expected to be delivered to customer sites in less than 24 hours from when an order is received. DTS wants to analyze the supply chain impact of consolidating MTC activities to a single facility for operational efficiencies. The rationalization of MTC activities to the CO facility affects DTS's ability to deliver tools within 24 hours due to the longer transportation times to customer districts. How can this longer transportation time be mitigated? Our research shows that using the OK facility as a postponement and distribution hub allows DTS to continue servicing expedited orders within 24 hours and results in a 28 % logistics cost savings over a direct shipment method. The postponement strategy entails staging reconditioned inventory at both the OK and CO facility where they can be configured for use within 4 hours of receiving an order. By simulating the movement of <b>inventory</b> around the <b>closed</b> <b>inventory</b> loop, we determined that the total number of tools in the network and the MTC capacity are two important levers of control that affect the availability of reconditioned inventory to service demand. We found {{that we were able to}} fulfill a target item fill rate by calculating capital inventory required using an "order up to" inventory policy and setting facility capacity at one standard deviation above average demand. by Ryan Rahim.

Specifically, adult attachment {{is concerned with the}} bond that develops between romantic partners, as categorized by four different adult attachment styles: Secure, Preoccupied, Dismissing, and Fearful. This study seeks to examine the role that adult attachment style might play in the perception of emotion in others, and whether there are individual differences in emotion perception accuracy among the different attachment styles in a sample of undergraduate college students. Based on previous research, the hypothesis was that Preoccupied individuals would show increased accuracy at perceiving emotions in others, while Dismissing individuals would show decreased accuracy at perceiving emotions in others. Attachment styles were determined through the use of the Experiences in <b>Close</b> Relationships-Revised <b>inventory</b> (ECR-R), and emotion perception accuracy was assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (RMET). Results indicated that while Preoccupied individuals did have increased accuracy and Dismissing individuals had decreased accuracy at perceiving emotions, this finding was confined to negative emotions. One proposed explanation for this finding is that a bias exists for Preoccupied and Dismissing individuals, and future research is suggested...|$|R
