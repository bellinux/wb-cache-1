40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} method for extracting selectional {{preferences}} of verbs from unannotated text. These selectional preferences are linked to an ontology (e. g. the hypernym relations found in WordNet), which allows for extending the coverage for unseen valency fillers. For example, if drink vodka {{is found in the}} training corpus, a whole WordNet hierarchy is assigned to the verb to drink (drink liquor, drink alcohol, drink beverage, drink substance, etc.), so that when drink gin is seen in a later stage, it is possible to relate the selectional preference drink vodka with drink gin (as gin is a <b>co-hyponym</b> of vodka). This information can be used for word sense disambiguation, prepositional phrase attachment disambiguation, syntactic disambiguation, and other applications within the approach of pattern-based statistical methods combined with knowledge. As an example, we present an application to word sense disambiguation based on the Senseval- 2 training text for Spanish. The results of this experiment are similar to those obtained by Resnik for English. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{acquisition}} of explicit semantics {{is still a}} research challenge. Approaches for the extraction of semantics focus mostly on learning hierarchical hypernym-hyponym relations. The extraction of <b>co-hyponym</b> and co-meronym sibling semantics is performed to a much lesser extent, though they are not less important in ontology engineering. In this paper we will describe and evaluate the XTREEM-SG (Xhtml TREE Mining- for Sibling Groups) approach on finding sibling semantics from semistructured Web documents. XTREEM {{takes advantage of the}} added value of mark-up, available in web content, for grouping text siblings. We will show that this grouping is semantically meaningful. The XTREEM-SG approach has the advantage that it is domain and language independent; it does not rely on background knowledge, NLP software or training. In this paper we apply the XTREEM-SG approach and evaluate against the reference semantics from two golden standard ontologies. We investigate how variations on input, parameters and reference influence the obtained results on structuring a closed vocabulary on sibling relations. Earlier methods that evaluate sibling relations against a golden standard report a 14. 18 % F-measure value. Our method improves this number into 21. 47 %. ...|$|R

This {{research}} aims to (1) {{identify the}} types of lexical cohesions taxonomic markers found in the novel The Sign of Four and its translation “Empat Pemburu Harta”, (2) identify {{the types of}} shifts found in translating the lexical cohesion taxonomic markers in the novel The Sign of Four, (3) elaborate the factors causing the translation shifts, (4) elaborate the effects of translation shifts {{on the quality of}} translation in the novel The Sign of Four. This descriptive qualitative research is an embedded case study and oriented to translation product. The sources of data for this research consist of documents and informants (rater) selected with purposive sampling technique. The documents refer to the The Sign of Four novel and its translation. The informants constitute three translation experts. The research data comprises of (1) lexical cohesions taxonomic markers found in the novel The Sign of Four and its translation version (Indonesian) in the form of word and phrase, (2) the translation expert’s statements about the accuracy and acceptability level. The techniques of collecting data used in this research were document analysis, questionnaires, and focus group discussion. The research data were analyzed using ethnography analysis which consisting of domain, taxonomy, and componential analysis until found a cultural theme. The findings show that: (1) there are nine types of lexical cohesion taxonomic markers which are categorized into hyponym, <b>co-hyponym,</b> conversion antonym, repetition, close synonym, attitudinal synonym, consistency, constitution meronymy, and constitution co-meronymy; (2) there are 553 shifts in translating the lexical cohesion taxonomic markers and they are categorized into seven types, i. e. deletion, addition, lexical substitution, level shifts, structure shifts, unit shifts, and intra system shifts; (3) there are two causing factors of the translation shifts, such as (a) intra-linguistic factors which consist of different grammatical rules and different lexical items, (b) extra-linguistic factors which consisting of cultural diversities and translator’s choices; (4) the shift’s effects on transition of lexical cohesion taxonomic markers to the quality of it’s translation shows the high level in acceptability and readability aspects.

From the terms and the related hypothesis we can harvest lexical patterns, which are linked to annotated domain concepts. The aim of the process is to learn inference patterns and apply the system to short as well as unstructured documents where fewer or no discourse-level cues are available, in order to acquire new <b>co-hyponyms</b> linked to their coordinating term via a specified relation. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{semi-automatic}} {{extraction of}} semantics for ontology enhancement or semantic-based information retrieval encompasses several open challenges. There are many {{findings on the}} identification of vertical relations among concepts, but much less on indirect, horizontal relations among concepts that share a common, a priori unknown parent, such as <b>Co-Hyponyms</b> and Co-Meronyms. We propose the method XTREEM-SP (Xhtml TREE Mining for Sibling Pairs) for the discovery of such binary &quot;sibling&quot;-relations between concepts of a given vocabulary. While conventional methods process an appropriately prepared corpus, XTREEM-SP operates upon an arbitrarily heterogeneous Web Document Collection on a given topic and returns sibling relations between concepts associated to it. XTREEM-SP is independent of domain and language and does not rely on linguistic preprocessing nor on background knowledge beyond the ontology it is asked to enhance. We present our evaluation results with two gold standard ontologies and show that XTREEM-SP performs well, while being computationally inexpensive. ...|$|E
40|$|Using small sets of {{adjectival}} seed antonym pairs, we automatically find patterns {{where these}} pairs co-occur {{in a large}} corpus of Dutch, and then use these patterns to extract new antonym pairs. Evaluation of extracted pairs by five human judges showed that automatic scores correlate with human evaluation and that pattern based methods {{can be used to}} extract new antonym pairs. The majority of extracted pairs were noun-noun pairs, contrary to expectations based on previous research. Additionally, the method identifies a subgroup of <b>co-hyponyms</b> that frequently function antonymously, and together with more traditional antonyms makes up a wider class of incompatibles, suggesting that antonymy is a diverse relation that includes pairs of different types and categories that are not captured by any single linguistic theory. Comparison with Dutch WordNet and an online Dutch dictionary shows that only a handful of extracted pairs are currently listed in these existing resources, emphasizing the usefulness of the project. ...|$|E
40|$|Semantic relations, such as synonyms, hypernyms and <b>co-hyponyms</b> {{proved to}} be useful for text {{processing}} applications, including text similarity, query expansion, question answering and word sense disambiguation. Such relations are practical because of the gap between lexical surface {{of the text and}} its meaning. Indeed, the same concept is often represented by different terms. However, existing resources often do not cover a vocabulary required by a given system. Manual resource construction is prohibitively expensive for many projects. On the other hand, precision of the existing extractors still do not meet quality of the hand-crafted resources. All these factors motivate the development of novel extraction methods. This thesis deals with similarity measures for semantic relation extraction. The main research question we address, is how to improve precision and coverage of such measures. First, we perform a large-scale study the baseline techniques. Second, we propose four novel measures. One of them significantly outperforms the baselines, the others perform comparably to the state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we successfully apply one of the novel measures in two text processing systems. (LING 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{is assumed}} by {{cognitive}} science {{to consist of}} concepts that are organised and maintained by complex processes taking place in human minds. These processes are not yet accessible directly. Language is still the primary medium for communicating knowledge and presumably linguistic objects and structures are expressions of knowledge and its organisation in mind. Collecting terms (i. e., creating a specialised vocabulary) and capturing their relationships are thus important mechanisms for distilling knowledge from specialised texts and for formalising it for machines. The approach taken in this thesis is to analyse the co-hyponymy relationships between terms as an organisational mechanism. <b>Co-hyponyms</b> are sets of lexical units sharing a common hypernym; bank and building society, for example, are <b>co-hyponyms</b> of the hypernym financial organisation. Analysing the co-hyponymy relationships between terms {{is important because it}} bridges the semantic gap between a) specialised lexical knowledge, b) the quantitative interpretation of meanings in specialised discourse, and c) machine-accessible conceptualisation of knowledge. This thesis proposes the use of a vector-based distributional representation of terms in order to construct a quantitative conceptual model of kinds-sorts in a given field of knowledge. Among empirical methods for analysing linguistic structures, distributional approaches to semantics encode language data to models that should correspond to the meanings of linguistic entities. The meaning of an entity, such as a word or a phrase, is assumed to be a function of its statistical distribution in contexts. In order to use these methods we thus need to define (a) the contexts, that is, which statistical information must be collected; and (b) the functions, that is, how this information must be used to correlate with a meaning. This thesis is a study of corpus-based distributional methods for characterising co-hyponymy between terms. Terms are represented as vectors to form a so-called term-space model. To obviate the curse of dimensionality and to facilitate the construction of models, novel methods employing sparse random projections are proposed. Random Manhattan indexing is used to construct L 1 -normed spaces and random indexing for L 2 -normed spaces. Following these steps a memory-based classifier exploits the distance between vectors to identify the presence of targeted co-hyponymy relationships. An evaluation is also performed to assess any reciprocal influences of the method 2 ̆ 7 s parameters on its performance. Userfriendliness, flexibility in updating and maintenance, and an innate capacity to resemble conceptual structures in a domain knowledge are the advantages of this method...|$|E

We evaluate it with a 10 -fold cross validation on 9, 600 pairs, equally distributed among the three classes and involving several Parts-Of-Speech (i. e. adjectives, nouns and verbs). When all the classes are present, ROOT 9 achieves an F 1 score of 90. 7 %, against a baseline of 57. 2 % (vector cosine). When the classification is binary, ROOT 9 achieves the following results against the baseline. hypernyms-co-hyponyms 95. 7 % vs. 69. 8 %, hypernyms-random 91. 8 % vs. 64. 1 % and co-hyponyms-random 97. 8 % vs. 79. 4 %. In order to compare the performance with the state-of-the-art, we have also evaluated ROOT 9 in subsets of the Weeds et al. (2014) datasets, proving that it is in fact competitive. Finally, we investigated whether the system learns the semantic relation or it simply learns the prototypical hypernyms, as claimed by Levy et al. (2015). The second possibility seems to be the most likely, even though ROOT 9 can be trained on negative examples (i. e., switched hypernyms) to drastically reduce this bias.

40|$|International audienceNouns such as belief, dogma, fact, order, philosophy, sign, etc. {{governing}} finite complement clauses are discursive {{devices for}} the speaker to characterize a proposition, an event or {{a state of}} affairs (cf. Biber et al. 1999 or Schmid 2000). Such nouns {{are part of a}} closed semantic class that undergoes a strong selectional constraint. As illustrated in example (1), the challenge for linguists remains to explain why philosophy, doctrine or dogma can govern a that complement clause whereas religion or linguistics cannot. (1) This rejects the philosophy [doctrine/dogma/*linguistics/*religion] that the market can deliver health or community care efficiently, effectively or fairly. (BYU-BNC) In the literature, linguists have often related head noun selectional constraints to abstractness (Quirk et al. 1985, Francis et al. 1998), derivation (Nomura 1993, Huddleston and Pullum 2002) or modality (Perkins 1983, Ballier 2007, and anonymous reference). Taking into account these studies, this paper aims at arguing that head noun selectional constraints cannot be explained through a single particular feature. For instance, one can notice that neither all the head nouns are abstract (message, sign, picture), nor all abstract nouns are head nouns (inflation, literature, peace) : the result of the vote is at least a hopeful sign [*peace] that sexist dinosaurs are on their last legs in the 20 th century, (BYU-BNC). Similarly, two abstract nouns can have a co-hyponymic relation but differ in that-clause governing: though philosophy and linguistics can be <b>co-hyponyms</b> of FIELD OF STUDY/DISCIPLINE (example 2), they do not have such a relation in that-clause governing as in example (1). (2) My Lords, Mr. Page was appointed as a lecturer in philosophy [linguistics] in the University of Hull with effect from 1 October 1966. (BYU-BNC) As for derivation, it can neither be a sufficient property to explain head noun selection in all cases (to write that P vs. *the/a writer/writing that P, to learn that P vs. the/a learner that P). As a result, instead of describing head noun selectional constraints on the basis of isolated features, we propose to deal with the phenomenon as depending on a set of common semantic features that enable nouns to take that complement clauses. In this vein, we work out five properties that nouns must have in order to govern that-clauses. These criteria consist of three lexico-semantic features: abstractness [+ABSTRACT], inanimate [−ANIMATE], nonhuman [−HUMAN] and two semantic-pragmatic features: modality [+MODALITY] and reference to discourse [+REF. TO DISCOURSE]. Such an approach pinpoints why nouns like believer, messenger or philosopher – contrary to belief, message and philosophy – cannot govern that-clauses. In comparing examples (3 and 4), one can see that the former are not head nouns since they do not meet any of the five features listed above. (3) We had a very strong belief [message/philosophy] that independence could be achieved through interdependence and interaction. (BYU-COCA) (4) *We had a very strong believer/messenger/philosopher that independence could be achieved through interdependence and interaction. It also enables us to explain why attitudinal/modal nouns like coward, liar, scum, swine, etc. do not govern that-clauses. At least two of the criteria above (abstractness and reference to discourse) are not satisfied: these nouns refer to specific extra-linguistic entities (“first order entities” in Lyons’ 1977 terms). Furthermore, the paper aims at showing that among the five criteria, [+MODALITY] and [+REF. TO DISCOURSE] seem to be the most predominant features, since, in addition to being part of the lexico-semantic defining set, they also determine the discursive function of the whole that-clause construction. Finally, the analysis reveals that modality and reference to discourse are two interdependent features. Intrinsically, any lexical or grammatical modal marker expresses the speaker’s attitudes or opinions in relation to a discursive or propositional content, {{which is to say that}} modalization and referring to discourse are interrelated semantic operations.
