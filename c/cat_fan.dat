50|$|On August 26-28, 2005, l'Atelier {{collaborated with}} Winnipeg artist Daniel Barrow {{to present the}} {{screening}} series, Garbage Hill: A Showcase of Discarded Winnipeg Film and TV, held at the Winnipeg Film Group's Cinematheque. The series was a compendium of former cable access television shows from VPW and Cablevision, locally produced television commercials and under appreciated films from thirty years of Manitoba filmmaking. Barrow presented clips from cable TV shows, such as dance free-for-all The Pollock and Pollock Gossip Show, repertory musical performance show The Cosmopolitans, and the white Persian <b>cat</b> <b>fan</b> club TV-newsletter What's New Pussycat, among others, with his signature overhead projector providing scrolling historical background on each show. L'Atelier national du Manitoba presented the history of locally produced, low-budget TV commercials in the feature-length video Kubasa in a Glass: the Fetishised Winnipeg TV Commercial 1976-1992. Barrow went on to continue collecting the work of 1980s cable access stars, and in 2009 Video Pool Media Arts Centre released, Winnipeg Babysitter, a DVD compendium of cable access clips featuring early performances of Guy Maddin, Marcel Dzama, Neil Farber, The Cosmopolitans, the Pollocks, and many more.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} his best efforts on the pitch, he soon became a target for the Black <b>Cats</b> <b>fans</b> to vent their frustrations, as the team's drop in form under Peter Reid {{continued}} and the team were relegated from the Premiership. In the summer of 2002, he gave the travelling Sunderland fans a two-fingered salute on a pre-season tour of France. His days at the Stadium of Light seemed numbered.|$|R
50|$|Let's All Hate Toronto then {{presents}} {{a list of}} the top ten reasons why Canada hates Toronto, including envy, violence, pollution and The Toronto Maple Leafs. In the end, Mr. Toronto is so discouraged that, like the Hamilton Tiger <b>Cats</b> <b>fans,</b> he puts a bag on his head and wanders into the fog at Toronto's Nuit Blanche art event, where, after admitting that Toronto does suck, he receives over 1,000 hugs from the Torontonians at the event, including the mayor of Toronto. This makes Mr. Toronto believe that his native city does not suck as the rest of Canada seems to think.|$|R

5000|$|The {{album was}} never {{released}} for retail sale but was sold at performances during their American tour and, as such, {{there are very}} few authentic copies of the album.

2500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "Puss made his debut in [...] "Shrek 2," [...] then did {{time in the}} two decreasingly funny sequels. Now he's got a movie of his own, and not a moment too soon." [...] Lisa Kennedy of The Denver Post gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "It would overstate matters to say Puss in Boots leaves its cat holding the bag (we had to get that in). But it also leaves its hero awaiting a richer fable, one befitting his charms and his portrayer's talents." [...] Anna Smith of Time Out gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots is uneven, but when it's on course, <b>cat</b> <b>fans</b> will be in heaven." [...] Amy Biancolli of the Houston Chronicle gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Puss in Boots prances along on three basic truths. One, cats are funny. Two, vain Spanish cats in high-heeled musketeer boots are even funnier. Lastly, booted, vain Spanish cats voiced by a breathy Antonio Banderas are flat-out hilarious." [...] Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, saying [...] "Puss In Boots makes a great theme-park ride, a thrill-a-minute feast for the eyes and the semicircular canals. But while the settings are impressively multidimensional, the characters are flatter than old-school cel drawings." ...|$|R
