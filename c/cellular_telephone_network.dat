50|$|After bankruptcy, in November 2001, Aerie Networks, a Denver-based {{broadband}} firm, {{purchased the}} assets of the company at a liquidation sale. Service was restored to Denver in August 2002, and to San Diego in November 2002. Aerie sold Ricochet to EDL Holdings in 2003, who then sold it to YDI Wireless in 2004. YDI Wireless changed its name to Terabeam Inc., and Ricochet then operated as a subsidiary of Terabeam. Terabeam pursued a less ambitious strategy for Ricochet and announced no plans for expansion. During the bankruptcy, ownership of the Ricochet radio transmitters had reverted to the municipalities where the radios were installed, so any expansion would have required Ricochet to renegotiate agreements with the cities or counties in question. In the meantime, wireless data services carried over the <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> had become increasingly popular (and available in most population centers worldwide), making the value of Ricochet technology unclear.In March 2006, there were about 8,000 subscribers between the two markets.In August 2007 the Ricochet service was acquired by Civitas Wireless Solutions LLC.Ricochet notified its Denver customers on March 28, 2008, that service would cease the next day.Civitas liquidated itself in February 2009 after bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|In {{wireless}} networks, {{the link}} spectral efficiency can be somewhat misleading, as larger values {{are not necessarily}} more efficient in their overall use of radio spectrum. In a wireless network, high link spectral efficiency may result in high sensitivity to co-channel interference (crosstalk), which affects the capacity. For example, in a <b>cellular</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>network</b> with frequency reuse, spectrum spreading and forward error correction reduce the spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz but substantially lower the required signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to non-spread spectrum techniques. This can allow for much denser geographical frequency reuse that compensates for the lower link spectral efficiency, resulting in approximately the same capacity ({{the same number of}} simultaneous phone calls) over the same bandwidth, using the same number of base station transmitters. As discussed below, a more relevant measure for wireless networks would be system spectral efficiency in bit/s/Hz per unit area. However, in closed communication links such as telephone lines and cable TV networks, and in noise-limited wireless communication system where co-channel interference is not a factor, the largest link spectral efficiency that can be supported by the available SNR is generally used.|$|E
