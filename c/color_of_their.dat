5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.|$|E

25|$|Melatonin {{was first}} {{discovered}} in {{connection to the}} mechanism by which some amphibians and reptiles change the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> skin. As early as 1917, Carey Pratt McCord and Floyd P. Allen discovered that feeding extract of the pineal glands of cows lightened tadpole skin by contracting the dark epidermal melanophores.|$|E
25|$|Ilala {{is among}} the middle income suburbs very near to the city center, and is marked by the Askari Monument. It {{contains}} some rival gang groups, whose activities include drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion and racketeering. Most famous gang groups are recognized by the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> scarf (bandanna). These are the black gang, red gang and blue gang, fighting for control and to maintain their territories and interests.|$|E

25|$|While {{there are}} some {{instances}} that a hearing aid uses a rechargeable battery or a long-life disposable battery, the majority of modern hearing aids use one of five standard button cell zinc–air batteries. (Older hearing aids often used mercury battery cells, but these cells have become banned in most countries today.) Modern hearing aid button cell types are typically referred to by their common number name or the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> packaging.|$|E
25|$|In his Baseball Hall of Fame {{induction}} {{speech in}} 1966, Ted Williams {{made a strong}} plea for inclusion of Negro league stars in the Hall. After the publication of Robert Peterson's landmark book Only the Ball was White in 1970, the Hall of Fame found itself under renewed pressure {{to find a way}} to honor Negro league players who would have been in the Hall had they not been barred from the major leagues due to the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> skin.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{take about}} 14 days to hatch into larvae, which eat continuously. They have a {{preference}} for white mulberry, having an attraction to the mulberry odorant cis-jasmone. They are not monophagous since they can eat other species of Morus, {{as well as some}} other Moraceae, mostly Osage orange. They are covered with tiny black hairs. When the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> heads turns darker, it indicates they are about to molt. After molting, the instar phase of the silkworms emerge white, naked, and with little horns on their backs.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} belief in the United States that red cars are stopped for {{speeding}} more often than other color cars. However, there is no statistical evidence that this is true. Many police departments have denied it, saying their officers stop drivers for their behavior, not the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> cars. The one survey that was made on this subject in 1990 by a St. Petersburg, Florida newspaper showed {{that the number of}} speeding tickets given to drivers of red cars was about the same as the proportion of red cars on the road in the community.|$|E
25|$|On August 30, 1813, a {{group of}} Muscogee (also known as Creek Indians) called the Red Sticks, so named for the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> war paint, perpetrated the Fort Mims massacre. The Red Sticks, led by chiefs Red Eagle and Peter McQueen, had broken away {{from the rest of}} the Creek Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. They were allied with Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief who had {{launched}} Tecumseh's War against the United States, and who was fighting alongside the British. During the massacre, hundreds of white American settlers and non-Red Stick Creeks were slaughtered. The resulting conflict became known as the Creek War.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{was written}} to {{entertain}} the Japanese court of the eleventh century, the work presents many difficulties to modern readers. First and foremost, Murasaki's language, Heian period court Japanese, was highly inflected and had very complex grammar. Another problem is that naming people was considered rude in Heian court society, so none of the characters are named within the work; instead, the narrator refers to men often by their rank or their station in life, and to women often by the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> clothing, or by the words used at a meeting, or by the rank of a prominent male relative. This results in different appellations for the same character depending on the chapter.|$|E

25|$|In this assessment, {{a person}} is asked to select a card from a deck with {{different}} mandalas (designs enclosed in a geometric shape) and then must choose a color from a set of colored cards. The person is then asked to draw the mandala from the card they choose with an oil pastel of the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> choice. The artist is then asked to explain {{if there were any}} meanings, experiences, or related information related to the mandala they drew. This test is based on the beliefs of Joan Kellogg, who sees a recurring correlation between the images, pattern and shapes in the mandalas that people draw and the personalities of the artists. This test assesses and gives clues to a person's psychological progressions and their current psychological condition (Malchiodi 1998).|$|E
25|$|The TSPC {{had also}} planned to realign {{the road at}} Lake Mohansic and replace the grade {{intersection}} with an interchange. In 1962, while the commission was finishing the northern section of the Taconic, the EHPA began that project. The original parkway became the northbound roadway and a new southbound one was built. The EHPA's improvements made the road safer and more efficient for the commuters who now used it, but changed {{the character of the}} road, widening it and replacing its concrete pavement with asphalt and its wooden guardrails with steel ones that were allowed to rust in order to approximate the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> predecessors. In 1964, I-84 was built through Dutchess and Putnam counties, giving the middle of the Taconic a limited-access intersecting route that made it possible to access the Danbury and Newburgh areas via the parkway.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} , which are called moose. The shape of these, and the varied <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> skins, {{is much like}} roes, but in size they surpass them a little and are {{destitute}} of horns, and have legs without joints and ligatures; nor do they lie down {{for the purpose of}} rest, nor, if they have been thrown down by any accident, can they raise or lift themselves up. Trees serve as beds to them; they lean themselves against them, and thus reclining only slightly, they take their rest; when the huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps of these animals whither they are accustomed to betake themselves, they either undermine all the trees at the roots, or cut into them so far that {{the upper part of the}} trees may appear to be left standing. When they have leant upon them, according to their habit, they knock down by their weight the unsupported trees, and fall down themselves along with them.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} Louis XIII Comes of Age {{represents the}} historical {{scene of the}} transferring of power from mother to son in abstract, or allegorical means. Marie has reigned as regent during her son's youth, and now she has handed the rudder of the ship to Louis, the new king of France. The ship represents the state, now in operation as Louis steers the vessel. Each of the rowers can be identified by the emblematic shields that hang {{on the side of}} the ship. The second rower's shield depicts a flaming altar with four sphinxes, a coiling serpent and an open eye that looks downwards. These characteristics are known to be that of Piety or Religion, both of which Maria would want her son to embody. What is also known as a parade boat, Rubens referencing Horace's boat, is adorned with a dragon on front and dolphins on the stern. Louis looks upwards to his mother for guidance on how to steer the ship of state. In the violent clouds are two Fames, one with a Roman buccina and the second with what seems to be a trumpet. Louis guides, while the ship's actual movement is due to the four rowing figures, personifying Force, Religion, Justice, and Concord. The figure adjusting the sail is thought to be Prudence or Temperance. At the center in front of the mast stands France, with a flame in her right hand illustrating steadfastness and the globe of the realm, or the orb of government, in her left. Force, extending her oar and heaving to, is identified by the shield just beneath her showing a lion and column. She is paired with Marie by the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> hair, and similarly Louis is paired with Religion, or the Order of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
500|$|Cope's {{views on}} human races would today be {{considered}} racist, and his beliefs {{were used by}} scientists of the time to justify imperialism. He believed that if, [...] "a race was not white then it was inherently more ape-like". He was not opposed to blacks because of the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> skin but their [...] "degrading vices", believing that the [...] "inferior Negro {{should go back to}} Africa." [...] He did not blame blacks for their perceived [...] "poor virtue", but wrote, [...] "A vulture will always eat carrion when surrounded on all hands by every kind of cleaner food. It {{is the nature of the}} bird." [...] Cope was against the modern view of women's rights, believing in the husband's role as protector; he was opposed to women's suffrage, as he felt they would be unduly influenced by their husbands.|$|E
500|$|Adopting the <b>color</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{favorite}} charioteers {{was a way}} fans {{showed their}} loyalty to that particular racer or faction. Many {{of the young men}} in the fan clubs, or factions, adopted extravagant clothing and hairstyles, such as billowing sleeves, [...] "Hunnic" [...] hair-styles, and [...] "Persian" [...] facial hair. There is evidence that these young men were the faction members most prone to violence and extreme factional rivalry. Some scholars have tried to argue that the factional rivalry and violence was a result of opposing religious or political views, but more likely the young men simply identified strongly with their faction for group solidarity. The factional violence was probably engaged in similarly to the violence of modern football or soccer fans. The games themselves were the usual focus of the factional violence, even when it was taken to the streets. Although fans who went to the hippodrome cheered on their favorite charioteers, their loyalty appears to be to the color for which the charioteer drove more than for the individual driver. Charioteers could change faction allegiance and race for different colors during their careers, but the fans didn't change their allegiance to their color.|$|E
