5|$|Sanders {{was unhappy}} with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan, {{but he refused to}} deep fry the chicken, which he {{believed}} lowered the quality of the product. If he pre-cooked the chicken in advance of orders, there was sometimes wastage at day's end. In 1939, the first commercial pressure <b>cookers</b> were released onto the market, mostly designed for steaming vegetables. Sanders bought one, and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used to fry chicken. The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying, while, in the opinion of Sanders, retaining the quality of pan-fried chicken.|$|E

In the past one to two decades, {{induction heating}} has been extended to the catering industry as induction <b>cooker.</b> Currently, the induction <b>cooker</b> draws more and more attentions {{as one of the}} popular kitchen appliances. This paper mainly investigates the magnetic field of induction <b>cooker</b> for improving its heating performance. Firstly, the magnetic field and heating performance of conventional induction <b>cooker</b> are analyzed. Furthermore, the problems associated with conventional induction <b>cooker</b> are identified. In order to overcome those disadvantages of traditional induction <b>cooker,</b> a novel coil format is proposed. Meanwhile, Finite Element Method is used to simulate and further analyze the behavior of the induction <b>cooker.</b> Finally, a prototype of the proposed induction <b>cooker</b> is built. The experimental results of conventional and the novel induction <b>cooker</b> are presented and compared.

40|$|A {{large size}} novel non-tracking solar <b>cooker</b> {{has been designed}}, {{developed}} and tested. The <b>cooker</b> has been designed {{in such a way}} that the width to length ratio for reflector and glass window is about 4 so that maximum radiation falls on the glass window. This has helped in eliminating azimuthal tracking that is required in simple hot box solar <b>cooker</b> towards the Sun every hour because the width to length ratio of reflector is 1. It has been found that stagnation temperatures were 118. 5 oC and 108 oC in large size non-tracking solar <b>cooker</b> and hot box solar <b>cooker</b> respectively. It takes about 2 h for soft food and 3 h for hard food. The <b>cooker</b> is capable of cooking 4. 0 kg of food at a time. The efficiency of the large size non-tracking solar <b>cooker</b> has been found to be 27. 5 %. The <b>cooker</b> saves 5175 MJ of energy per year. The cost of the <b>cooker</b> is Rs. 10000. 00 (1. 0 US$ = Rs. 50. 50). The payback period has been calculated by considering 10 % annual interest, 5 % maintenance cost and 5 % inflation in fuel prices and maintenance cost. The payback period is least, i. e. 1. 58 yr., with respect to electricity and maximum, i. e. 4. 89 yr., with respect to kerosene. The payback periods are in increasing order with respect to fuel: electricity, coal, firewood, liquid petroleum gas, and kerosene.
