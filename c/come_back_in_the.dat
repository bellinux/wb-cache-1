5|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Chicago Rockets 41–21 at Chicago's Soldier Field {{to extend the}} team's winning streak to four games. The Browns scored a {{touchdown}} {{in the first quarter}} and two more in the second. The team led 27–0 at the half. Chicago, however, started to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third quarter after Cleveland coach Paul Brown took out most of his first-string players. Graham, Colella, Lew Mayne and Ed Ulinski sat out most of the game. Chicago quarterback Sam Vacanti threw three touchdown passes in the second half to give the Rockets 21 points, but a score by Cleveland's Boedeker and a fumble return for a touchdown by Spiro Dellerba kept the game out of reach. The Rockets' Bill Kellagher intercepted one of Graham's passes in the first quarter, ending Graham's streak of 91 straight pass attempts without an interception, a professional football record at the time. Chicago had the best passing performance against the Browns of any team the Browns had faced in 1947 as Vacanti threw for 195 yards on 11 completions. Groza kicked through two field goals and five extra points in the game, putting him in third place in scoring in the AAFC behind Motley and New York's Spec Sanders. Motley suffered a head injury during a pileup in the second quarter and was taken to the locker room.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{captaincy}} {{crisis of}} the national team, {{in the absence of}} the injured captain, Moin Khan, The Pakistan Cricket Board surprisingly started giving indications of making Ijaz as the interim captain of the team for then the incoming Singapore Challenge series against New Zealand and South Africa. Nevertheless, he was not selected as captain but his <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team was confirmed after 14 months. So Ijaz Ahmad joined the team in Singapore in the absence of injured regular skipper, Moin Khan. Waqar Younis was leading the team on emergency basis. Ijaz Ahmad made a brilliant batting <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Singapore Challenge Series against New Zealand and South Africa. He scored a quick innings of 49 not out of just 21 balls in a rain affected match, which was reduced to 25 overs per side before toss. Ijaz's Innings helped Pakistan giving a tough target of 192 runs to New Zealand in 25 overs, a match which Pakistan eventually won by 29 runs.|$|E

In Game 5 in Anaheim, Johnson made an effective relief appearance after Mike Mussina gave up 5 runs and 6 hits to give the Angels a 5–2 lead, but the Yankees were unable to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|E

25|$|Bohr's {{argument}} about the impossibility of using the apparatus proposed by Einstein to violate the principle of indeterminacy depends crucially {{on the fact that}} a macroscopic system (the screen S1) obeys quantum laws. On the other hand, Bohr consistently held that, in order to illustrate the microscopic aspects of reality, it is necessary to set off a process of amplification, which involves macroscopic apparatuses, whose fundamental characteristic is that of obeying classical laws and which can be described in classical terms. This ambiguity would later <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of what is still called today the measurement problem.|$|E

Even {{if the number of}} infected persons were not significantly greater, the resurgence of the disease in globally linked countries probably would generate a significant impact again. The return of SARS to Asia is likely to cause somewhat less disruption the second time as citizens learn to live with the disease, but more multinational companies probably would reduce their exposure in the region if they concluded that SARS posed a long-term health challenge. Bigger outbreaks in Europe or the United States would hit {{a whole new set of}} business and government players, potentially doing serious damage to trade and growth.|$|E

25|$|By {{the start}} of September, the Royalist {{garrison}} of Southsea Castle consisted of only a dozen men. On the night of 4 September, a Parliamentarian force of 400 infantry equipped with ladders and backed by cavalry set out to attack the castle. Although the force was spotted and fired on by the guns of Portsmouth, {{they were able to}} make to the seaward side of the castle. Simultaneously, a small party approached the main gate and called on the castle to surrender. Captain Challoner was at the time somewhat inebriated and asked them to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. At around this time, the guns of Portsmouth once more opened fire on the assaulting force, and the Parliamentarians responded by scaling the walls and capturing the castle without further opposition. A significant Parliamentarian garrison was then installed in the castle to keep it from being recaptured.|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} quarter Michigan closed to within four off of Vincent Smith's 18-yard TD catch. Ohio State re-extended their lead to eleven {{a few minutes later}} with a 12-yard TD catch by Daniel Herron. Michigan {{attempted}} to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth quarter, but all of their drives except the last were ended by interceptions. [...] The Wolverines came closest with eight minutes left, when Forcier was intercepted in the end zone by Buckeye CB Devon Torrence. [...] On their last play of the game, the Wolverines were penalized for being in an illegal formation with five players in the backfield; this penalty was declined, giving the ball back to Ohio State on downs and ending the game after the Buckeyes ran out the clock.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, Plantard was {{inspired}} by a 1960 magazine Les Cahiers de l'Histoire to center his personal genealogical claims, as found in the [...] "Priory of Sion documents", on the Merovingian king Dagobert II, who had been assassinated in the 7th century. He also adopted [...] "Et in Arcadia ego...", a slightly altered version of a Latin phrase that most famously appears as the title of two paintings by Nicolas Poussin, as the motto of both his family and the Priory of Sion, because the tomb which appears in these paintings resembled one in the Les Pontils area near Rennes-le-Château. This tomb would become a symbol for his dynastic claims as the last legacy of the Merovingians on the territory of Razès, left to remind the select few who have been initiated into these mysteries that the [...] "lost king", Dagobert II, would figuratively <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a hereditary pretender.|$|E
500|$|The 2004 Motor City Bowl {{was played}} on December27,2004 at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. The game was {{anticipated}} to be a high-scoring affair, with both teams' quarterbacks {{among the top}} seven nationally in passing that year. [...] However, Toledo quarterback Bruce Gradkowski had broken his throwing hand during the MAC Championship Game and was largely ineffective; he was only able to complete six of twelve passes for 43yards and did not play in the second half. [...] Connecticut scored {{what was then a}} Motor City Bowl-record 17points in the first quarter, from a field goal, a 32-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Dan Orlovsky to wide receiver Jason Williams on a 4th-down-and-6 play, and a 68-yard punt return for a touchdown by Larry Taylor. [...] In the second quarter, after Toledo finally scored on a one-yard rushing touchdown by Gradkowski, UConn added 13 more points to the scoreboard. [...] The Rockets would not <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half; the Huskies won the game 3910. [...] Orlovsky was named the game's most valuable player (MVP); he completed 20 of 41 passes for 239yards and twotouchdowns.|$|E

500|$|The Redlegs {{went on to}} {{win their}} next four games, {{including}} a match against Collingwood where Wilson played as a forward and kicked two of the team's four goals in the absence of their main goalkicker William Smith. A week later against Fitzroy, Wilson again played forward and kicked two goals, including one from over [...] out, in a two-goal win. Wilson was one of Melbourne's best in the round 13 game against Williamstown, according to the North Melbourne Advertiser. The next week Melbourne met Essendon for the second time that season. Each side had won all their matches for the year so far, except for the drawn game between the two teams earlier in the year. The Age wrote that the match had been eagerly awaited and that nearly 30,000 spectators attended, including hundreds of people from places as far away as Bendigo and Ballarat. In a contrast to the two sides' first meeting, it was the Same Olds who started strongest and they led by four goals to one at half time. Wilson had one of the opening shots on goal of the game, but was only able to register a behind. Melbourne began to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half and Wilson set up Mickey Roche to kick the Redlegs' second goal of the match. At three-quarter time, Melbourne were still three goals in arrears and they came out playing some of their best football of the year—O'Loughlin kicked a goal midway through the quarter and then several players, including Wilson, had unsuccessful shots on goal. Ernest Howes scored the Reds' fourth goal, {{but it was too late}} for Melbourne as the siren to end the game sounded only seconds later.|$|E
500|$|Led by league MVP Tittle, {{who passed}} for over 3,000yards and 36 touchdowns, the Giants had an 11–3 record in 1963. They set what remains the NFL's {{record for most}} points in a 14-game season by scoring 448. They {{advanced}} to face the Chicago Bears in the NFL championship game. On an icy field, New York's defense played well, but Chicago's newly invented zone defense intercepted Tittle five times (including one returned for a score) and injured Tittle {{in the first half}} (though he finished the game). Several Giants players including linebacker Huff pleaded with Sherman to replace the hobbled Tittle, who the players felt was pressing and committing too many turnovers, from playing the second half. Sherman however, had little alternative. [...] "The old man kept saying 'I can do it. I feel a little better'" [...] Sherman recalled. [...] "We had a young quarterback (Glynn Griffing), he had gone to get married a couple of weeks earlier but failed to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days he said he would. We couldn't use him." [...] The Giants defense, led by Hall of Famer Huff, held the Bears in check, but they lost 14–10, their third straight NFL Championship Game defeat. New York had a chance to take a 14–0 lead in the first quarter but wide receiver Del Shofner dropped a potential touchdown in the end zone, a drop he said in 2010, that he feels would have won the Giants the game. [...] "I was alone in the end zone—ball right into my hands, nobody around me—and I dropped the ball...as good a defense as we had that year, I don't think the Berar would have ever come back from being down 14–0." [...] On the next play, Tittle threw an interception to Chicago linebacker Larry Morris, which he returned to the New York five-yard line. Two plays later, the Bears tied the game.|$|E
