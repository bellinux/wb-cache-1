40|$|In this paper, {{two models}} (M 9 B 1 and M 9 B 2 <b>connection</b> <b>types)</b> of acacia glulam wood {{exterior}} beam-to-column connections with angles and steel rod system have been developed. Both {{models have been}} tested experimentally under monotonic static and cyclic loadings. The behaviour of each model under static and cyclic loadings, maximum displacement, maximum moment, equivalent viscous damping ratio, stiffness degradation, rotational stiffness and ductility have been observed. From the test results {{it can be concluded}} that the behaviour of the connections were influenced by the number of bearing steel rods at the beam, wood quality, and thickness of the angles. The M 9 B 1 <b>connection</b> <b>type</b> has more flexibility than the M 9 B 2 <b>connection</b> <b>type.</b> Three dimensional finite element analyses considering anisotropic plasticity have been conducted for both models. It can be concluded that in M 9 B 1 <b>connection</b> <b>type,</b> the tensile forces due to the moment are received by the combination of tensile steel rods and bearing force in the steel rod and wood around it. Overall performance of M 9 B 2 <b>connection</b> <b>type</b> is better than that of M 9 B 1 <b>connection</b> <b>type</b> because the former has higher initial stiffness and higher rotational ductility than the later...|$|R

By selecting two <b>connection</b> <b>types</b> between the inner shell and the outer shell for calculation, which were direct <b>connection</b> <b>type</b> and indirect <b>connection</b> <b>type,</b> and comparing these with the connectionless heat transfer, the heat transfer process in the refuge chamber subjected to thermal loadings of constant temperature was respectively discussed with numerical analysis method. Effect of heat bridges to heat transfer of the refuge chamber’s shell was analyzed. The analysis {{results showed that the}} average heat flux through direct connection heat bridge and indirect connection heat bridge had respectively increased by 668 % and 30 % than that of the connectionless heat transfer. The influencing scope of the former was larger than the latter’s. And more heat entered the refuge chamber through the direct connection heat bridge. Therefore, the indirect <b>connection</b> <b>type</b> should be used {{in the design of the}} refuge chamber’s shell...|$|R

40|$|Bridge {{substructures}} {{are generally}} constructed using cast-in-place concrete {{and designed to}} undergo inelastic deformation in earthquake events. Although this construction approach {{has proven to be}} economical and provides adequate seismic performance through the formation of ductile plastic hinges, there are downsides relating to construction speed and quality, and post-earthquake repairability. This thesis explores two categories of Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC) <b>connection</b> <b>types,</b> which use precast concrete instead of cast-in-place concrete to offer advantages including increased construction speed and quality. High Damage (HD) ABC <b>connection</b> <b>types</b> emulate the seismic behaviour of cast-in-place construction through the formation of ductile plastic hinges. Controlled Damage (CD) ABC <b>connection</b> <b>types</b> use unbonded post-tensioned precast connections to offer additional advantages including reduced residual drifts, limited and controlled damage and simple repair options. Novel buckling-restrained, fused mild steel energy dissipators suitable for use in CD connections are also developed and tested. These designs utilise 'dry' fabrication to simplify the fabrication process and minimise cost. Half-scale experimental testing is carried out to demonstrate both the assembly processes and behaviour under reversed cyclic uniaxial and biaxial loading representing an earthquake event. Following benchmark testing, repair strategies are applied to the CD <b>connection</b> <b>types</b> and the columns are tested again, representing a subsequent earthquake event. Good results are obtained from all cases with relatively straightforward construction and repair processes. With further developments and testing, the <b>connection</b> <b>types</b> proposed can provide competitive alternatives to conventional bridge pier design with regard to seismic performance and life cycle costs, with the additional benefits associated with precast construction...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the biomechanical environment of immediately placed implants, before and after osseointegration, by comparing three different implant-abutment <b>connection</b> <b>types.</b> Materials and Methods: A computer tomography-based finite element model of an upper central incisor extraction socket was constructed containing implants with either external hex, internal hex, or Morse-taper connection. Frictional contact elements were used in the bone, implant, abutment, and abutment screw interfaces in the immediately placed simulations. In osseointegrated simulations, the repair of bone alveolar defect and a glued bone-to-implant interface were assumed. By analysis of variance, the influence was assessed of <b>connection</b> <b>type,</b> clinical situation, and loading magnitude on the peak equivalent strain in the bone, peak von Mises stress in the abutment screw, bone-to-implant relative displacement, and abutment gap. Results: The loading magnitudes had a significant contribution, regardless of the assessed variable. However, the critical clinical situation of an immediately placed implant itself was the main factor affecting the peak equivalent strain in the bone and bone-to-implant displacement. The largest influence of the <b>connection</b> <b>type</b> in this protocol was seen on the peak equivalent stress in the abutment screw. On the other hand, a higher influence of the various <b>connection</b> <b>types</b> on bone stress/strain could be noted in osseointegrated simulations. Conclusions: The implant-abutment connection design did not significantly influence the biomechanical environment of immediately placed implants. Avoiding implant overloading and ensuring a sufficient initial intraosseous stability are the most relevant parameters for the promotion of a safe biomechanical environment in this protocol. status: publishe...|$|R

Data is received from multiple applications, for example {{in the form of}} data units, and is associated with a traffic type. The traffic type associated with a data unit indicates whether the data unit is inelastic traffic or elastic traffic. Data associated with inelastic traffic is mapped to at least one connection of a first <b>connection</b> <b>type</b> which provides for some amount of committed bandwidth, and limits on delay variation. Data associated with elastic traffic is mapped to at least one connection of a second <b>connection</b> <b>type,</b> which does not provide any committed bandwidth. Connections of the second <b>connection</b> <b>type</b> may ensure that elastic traffic data units that are accepted for transfer by the underlying network are delivered without loss due to network congestion, for example, by use of a flow control technique. A hierarchical scheduler may be employed to schedule transmissions of data units across connections organized into virtual trunks.
