40|$|My thesis {{attempts}} to search {{evidence on the}} performance of the currency board regime and its impact on Hong Kong’s economy. Three sets of related questions have been set up and carefully investigated in my empirical models. Chapter 2 investigates output growth and inflation rate in order to compare the historical performance of free-floating and currency board regimes for Hong Kong. I apply some advanced econometrics tools to identify my structural VAR models and offer appropriate analysis. My first empirical model suggests that output returns to a steady state much faster in a flexible exchange rate regime than in a fixed exchange rate regime after an aggregate demand shock. My evidence offers an essential answer to the question on why the recovering process of Hong Kong from the Asian financial crisis lasted longer compared with the other Asian countries with a flexible exchange rate regime. Furthermore, my counter-factual analysis suggests that a free-floating regime may generate much smaller output variance in Hong Kong and deliver higher output and price levels to Hong Kong. Chapter 3 investigates the currency board regime from 1984 to 2007, by considering some important variables which have significant impacts on Hong Kong’s economy. For instance my empirical models attempt to examine the economic relationships with the US economy under the currency board regime and the close economic relationships with China under a Closer Economic Partnership Agreement with Mainland China. My models emphasises the importance of entrepot trade for Hong Kong’s economy. Evidence shows that those exogenous variables have significant impacts on Hong Kong’s economy, and they are one of the important factors when considering the choice of exchange rate regimes. My empirical evidence indicates some new findings which contradict existing studies which conclude that the Chinese economy is much less significant than the US economy in explaining Hong Kong’s output variance. Chapter 4 examines the real effective exchange rate misalignment of the two economies, Hong Kong and Singapore, and offers new policy implications on the choice of exchange rate regimes. Entrepot trades are essential to both economies. While the literature has paid little attention to such an important character and shown evidence of larger scale REER misalignment in Hong Kong compared with Singapore, my model reveals that including such an important variable has remarkably improved the model and offered strikingly different conclusions. I have applied Vector Error Correction Modelling and the Johansson Method in identifying the empirical models. Evidence suggests that Hong Kong performs well in terms of small real exchange rate misalignment even under its currency broad regime. My thesis indicates that although there are limitations in the currency broad regime in terms of relatively slow recovery from external demand shocks and relatively larger output variance, the regime is still a preferable choice for Hong Kong, especially when we consider the <b>close</b> <b>economic</b> <b>link</b> with Mainland China and the United States. Moreover, there is no evidence in my models to suggest that the real exchange rate misalignment was significantly larger in the case of Hong Kong’s currency board regime. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Specifically the study wanted to study wanted to find out the readiness of the private sector and how favorable were the structural trade mechanism and legal framework in promoting the trade and investment between Tanzanian and Oman and United Arab Emirate. A total of 69 respondents were engaged by the study (i. e. 40. 4 % female and 59. 6 % males). These included officials from the government ministries, chambers of commerce, investment promotion agencies, parliamentary committee, business community members among others. The main finding reveals that, there was low level of preparedness of the private sector to promote investment in Tanzania as compared with the strong and buoyant private sector in Oman and United Arab Emirates. It was further revealed that the existing trade structural mechanisms in Tanzania were different with the structural trade mechanism in GCC countries. The GCC countries had relatively better terms and conditions when comparing with that of Tanzania likewise the legal frame work existing in Tanzania and GCC played a different role to promote trade and investment. This was facilitated by different level of development as well as different of interests among different countries.

Moldavia is {{for the first time}} in its history an independent state, having been formed as a result of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the same is true of Chisinau in its role as state capital. Moldavia's economic basis can be found in agriculture (wine, fruit, tobacco, sugar beet, vegetables, cereal, sunflowers), thanks to favourable natural conditions, as well as the food trade, linked to this. When the state was founded, Moldavia was faced with the question, whether it should attempt to forge close links or even merge with the neighbouring state of Rumania to the West, or to further pursue the <b>close</b> <b>economic</b> <b>links</b> to Eastern Europe, dominated by Russia. A first wave of Moldavian-Rumanian feelings of belonging together was followed by the political aspiration to retain Moldavia’s territorial independence and integrity, which has remained until the present day. The second point was greatly affected by the Russian speaking minority group and the Russian troops, stationed in Moldavia, around Tiraspol. "After the elections, Moldavia starts drifting eastwards", were the words used by international observers to describe this Moldavian turnaround. It appears to be settled that, for the foreseeable future, Moldavia will remain an independent state and will retain close economical and political links to Eastern Europe, within the framework of the CIS (Confederation of Independent States) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the significance of}} the Commonwealth in Canadian foreign policy, the motivations behind Canadian policy and the reasons for changes in this policy in the period 1956 - 1965 in particular. It does so by evaluating Canadian policy towards the development and use of Commonwealth institutions for cooperation. The thesis begins by sketching the development of Canadian policy towards the Commonwealth between 1944 and 1955. It argues that Canadian behaviour during this period set a pattern, which as it evolved in the face of changing conditions, was generally pursued through the period 1956 to 1965. The Commonwealth's role in Canadian policy was as a 'bridge' between the West and the new members from the developing world in support of Western interests in the Cold War. The thesis then looks at the year 1956. When the Suez Crisis occurred, the Commonwealth seemed poised for another transformation as members prepared to admit the first African member and considered British plans for <b>closer</b> <b>economic</b> <b>links</b> with Europe. The Canadian government's actions highlight its efforts to counteract division within the Commonwealth and preserve the 'bridge' to the developing world. The next three chapters review the record of John Diefenbaker's premiership. When he came to office in 1957, he proposed upgrading Canadian foreign policy towards the Commonwealth. Diefenbaker launched initiatives on trade and aid, and had to react to changing patterns of membership, a Commonwealth crisis over South Africa and the British application for EEC membership. Where the Diefenbaker government diverged from the established pattern of Canadian behaviour, its policies failed. For the most part, however, it maintained this pattern as the only practical way to effectively use the modern Commonwealth in ways conducive to the maintenance and advancement of Canadian interests. The last chapter {{examines the}} Canadian government's support for the Commonwealth secretariat. The thesis argues {{that this was not a}} substantial shift in Canadian policy, but rather a reflection of changes which had taken place within the Commonwealth and was largely consistent with previous policy...|$|R

40|$|The author {{applies the}} theme of the last two papers in the Global Economic Prospects series, written by the International Economics Department, to the case of one {{developing}} region: East Asia. He documents the rapid integration of the East Asian economies into the world economy through trade and foreign direct investment, and suggests that this has helped create a relatively well-diversified structure of production and of external markets. As a result, East Asia was relatively unaffected by the great terms-of-trade shocks experienced by other developing countries in the 1980 s. East Asia's creditworthiness in international financial markets meant that (except for the Philippines) it could maintain access to external capital flows during the world years of the debt crisis. East Asia's <b>close</b> <b>economic</b> <b>links</b> {{with the rest of the}} world makes the region particularly vulnerable to shocks originating externally. Simulations suggest that its growth rate is closely related to the growth rate of the OECD economies, even if its export markets are more diversified than those of other developing regions. Similarly, given the strength of its export drive to the industrial economies in the last two decades, especially in the labor-intensive products, East Asia would stand to gain the most from a successful Uruguay Round. By the same token, it would hurt more if the Uruguay Round failed and industrial protection increased as a result. So, East Asia must closely watch developments involving the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Although preliminary analysis suggests that the immediate trade consequences of NAFTA would be negligible for East Asia, the longer-run consequences for foreign direct investment and trade flows are more difficult to predict. Finally, the region's strong physical and institutional infrastructure, its outwardly oriented trade policies, and its well-developed human resource base, have attracted a large share of incremental private capital flows to developing countries. But such flows are volatile and sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and the regulatory environment in host countries. Were these conditions to change in East Asia and inhibit foreign direct investment and private portfolio flows, the region's rapid transformation into a competitive producer of manufactures would be affected adversely.

It was sponsored by the Secretariat to the Cree Nation/Abitibi-Témiscamingue Economic Alliance (SAENCAT) whose mandate is to foster <b>closer</b> <b>economic</b> <b>links</b> between the stakeholders of the region and the Cree nation. This study examined the contribution made by Aboriginal people to the businesses of the region in the areas of operations (contribution in terms of capital or employees) and market (share of the Aboriginal clientele in relation to the global market of the business). The study also endeavoured to describe how regional business people perceive their Aboriginal clientele. The data was collected during the summer of 2006 through a telephone survey conducted among one hundred or so businesses that have business links with Aboriginal people. It was completed by the use of statistical data in order that the survey results could be placed in a regional context. Based on the results of the study, it appears that the contribution of the Aboriginal people is significantly weak in areas related to the labour and capital of regional businesses. On the other hand, Aboriginals contribute at a much higher level as clients of regional business establishments: The market share of regional businesses that do business with Aboriginals varies between five and fifteen percent depending on the MRC. The MRC of the Valléede- l’Or has the largest concentration of businesses that deal with Aboriginals with market shares superior to the other MRCs. The regional businesses feel that the Aboriginal clientele consolidates the current activity and that it also represents a potential for the future. The relations between the businesses and their Aboriginal clients or partners are considered as harmonious; nevertheless, there are certain difficulties and according to the regional business people, these difficulties are mainly due to a lack of mutual knowledge (between non-Aboriginals and Aboriginals).

40|$|What {{implication}} does {{membership of}} the European Union (EU) have for the national diplomatic systems of its member states? How valid {{is the notion of}} a collective EU diplomacy? These two linked but distinct questions form the focus of this chapter. In examining the impact that the EU has had on its member states, a common approach has been to use the concept of Europeanization as a means of denoting the way in which national policy-making has adapted to the European context (Blair, 2002). A central feature of this viewpoint is the growth in the number and range of areas of government that are affected by and are involved in European policy. This is a trend that has been particularly apparent in recent years, with the introduction of the Single European Market (SEM) acting not just as a catalyst for <b>closer</b> <b>economic</b> and trading <b>links,</b> but also as the driving force behind further integration in such areas as social policy.

40|$|Demand Side Management (DSM) is the {{planning}} and implementation of strategies intended to encourage electricity consumers to reduce energy demand, improve energy efficiency, shift time of usage and promote the use of renewable energy based distributed generation system. It is a <b>close</b> socio- <b>economic</b> <b>link</b> between the utility and consumer for mutually benefiting to both. The research undertaken rivets on the potential use of DSM strategies to regulate electrical energy demand and mitigate carbon emissions in Oman. The main objective {{of this research is}} to examine the DSM based activities and policy options which could achieve significant reduction in electricity demand at the distribution network connected to the residential sector. It is revealed that temperature is the major environmental factor while use of air- conditioner units and practice of subsidised tariffs are epic centres of lavish electricity consumption at residential sector in Oman. This study applies a scenario based approach to identify viable energy efficiency and load reduction methods. The technical analysis comprises of bottom-up approach considering operational, behavioural and environmental factors to simulate the hourly load profile. Household load patterns are developed to identify and implement a range of DSM technological activities. An analytical model is set up to control the household load with minimal compromise of end-user satisfaction. Obtained results show that application of DSM strategies could contribute the substantial reduction in peak load and total energy demand. Studies carried out on renewable energy based hybrid power system manifest the viability and cost effectiveness of distributed generation to mitigate carbon emissions and peak load demand. The results of technical analysis are used to explicate the essential policy priorities underpinning the sustainable development of energy sector and mitigate the environmental issues. This comprehensive study provides the base to recommend the incentive based DSM programmes, smart metering, legal frame work for energy efficiency standards and labelling, investment subsidies to encourage renewable energy and legislation for distributed generation. The research has explored the benefits of DSM programmes along with barriers and challenges to implement the appropriate policies. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
