40|$|The {{line pipe}} forming {{operation}} {{can be divided}} into two parts, first is to achieve the required shape in terms of curvature and ovality after formation of the line pipe. The curvature and ovality ultimately affects the final dimensional controls at the later stage i. e. after mechanical expansion of the line pipe. The second part is to make right welding joint geometry to make the final long seam weld of line pipe. The welding joint geome-try ultimately controls soundness of final seam weld at later stage i. e. during submerged arc welding of the line pipe. As far as curvature or shape of line pipe is concerned, important operation is making the required curvature along the edges of TMCP and ACC (Thermo mechanical controlled processing and accelerated cooling process) plate for line pipe (Plate Edge <b>Crimping</b> <b>press)</b> up to the 150 mm in width minimum and forming of the line pipe at J-C-O press. The selection of dies with proper hardness and curvature in both the operation plays a vital role in the formation of line pipes. The main parameters of selection dies (Tools) are size of line pipe for which dies/tools are to be made i. e. the diameter of line pipe, thickness of line pipe and most important is grade of line pipe (Strength level). The grade or strength level decides amount of spring back behavior of the steel Plate. The spring back behavior again varies from steel mill to steel mill in the same grade of HR plate. This is because the each steel mill has its own manufacturing procedures to produc...|$|E
40|$|Valeo Engine Cooling in Mjällby mainly {{produces}} truck coolers. At {{the production}} site, there is on-going work {{to phase out}} the automobile cooler manufacturing and concentrate the production to one facility. At {{the same time the}} main production flow needs to be improved. The purpose of this Master’s Thesis is to analyze the flow of coolers from the brazing furnaces through the different crimping and welding assembly stations, to find problem areas and implement changes to improve the situation. The analysis has pointed out three different areas: • The need to increase throughput of the brazing furnaces and lower the work in progress levels by reducing change-over times • The necessity to organize the crimping stock in FIFO and improve the layout • The importance of having a separate stock area assigned for manual welding assembly Currently, the brazing furnaces are operated 24 hours a day and this is still not sufficient to meet customer demands. Therefore, every extra hour of production that can be gained is valuable. The work with the change-overs in the brazing furnaces has resulted in a step-by-step guide to shorten the change-over time. It is based on the SMED methodology (Single Digit Minute Exchange of Die) and an analysis of shift reports from the furnaces. The yearly extra profit that would be made by implementing each step has been calculated to be between 2 and approximately 15 million SEK. The work is supposed to point out the importance of working on reducing the change-over times and show which actions are the most profitable. The actions include: reducing the number of belt speeds in the furnaces, having an end of line stock for all products, optimizing change-overs on the same belt speed and shorten the time used for changing belt speeds. Today, the crimping storage is very unorganized and difficult to overview. The plan is to store the cores in rows of wagons, instead of pallets, and to use the FIFO (First In First Out) principle. The stock levels fluctuate heavily over the week. To be able to dimension the new storage area the variations have been carefully analyzed. Two layout suggestions were created and compared. Both alternatives have advantages, but one of them was found to be superior due to higher safety and better stock organisation. The layout of a nearby water leak test station had to be changed in order to have the cell working as efficiently as today. The final layout alternative made this possible using a smaller area than today. The analysis of the main process flow showed that today there is no separate storage area for manual welding. Instead, these products are mixed within the robot welding assembly stock, and thereby complicating the work for the operators. A new storage area was needed with an area able to store 15 pallets. From the decision factors two layout alternatives were created. The chosen alternative is located closer to the manual welding cells and requires less extensive layout changes. To have everything working on the least possible area, the supply of tanks to a nearby crimping station had to be done with supply trains. These wagons were designed and built. They were also tested in a supply loop and at the <b>crimping</b> <b>press</b> with good results. Unfortunately, the wagons could not be added to the train loop since {{there was no room for}} the tanks in the service area. Still, it served as a good example of how much space is made available in a work cell by using small boxes and supply trains. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

The advantages of this method are that it should {{last as long as}} the tubing, it takes less time to complete than other methods, it is cleaner in both appearance and the materials used to make the connection, and no open flame is used during the connection process. The disadvantages are that the fittings used are harder to find and cost significantly more than sweat-type fittings.|$|R
