5|$|Following the battalion's establishment, Marlan {{set about}} {{choosing}} a <b>cadre</b> <b>of</b> senior commissioned and non-commissioned personnel around {{which to build}} the battalion. These personnel included the battalion second-in-command, the quartermaster and adjutant, as well as senior enlisted soldiers to undertake administrative and instructional work. These were recruited from several of the existing Queensland-based Militia battalions including the 25th, 42nd and 47th Battalions. One member recruited at the time had served with the 15th Battalion that had been raised {{as part of the}} First Australian Imperial Force, during World War I.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} seven years {{following}} 1988, when the CF-18 was being delivered, the squadron ran six-month full-squadron courses from which the graduating pilots formed new CF-18 squadrons. Following this initial <b>cadre</b> <b>of</b> courses, No.410 Squadron trained CF-18 pilots {{at a rate of}} approximately 50 per year. In 1992, with the closure of three squadrons in Germany, this was reduced to 25. With the recent reduction in size of the remaining operational squadrons, No.410 Squadron now trains approximately 20 fighter pilots annually.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} {{war broke out}} in Europe, the Australian armed forces were less {{prepared}} than at the outbreak of World WarI in August 1914. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the best-prepared of the three services, was small and equipped with only two heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, two sloops, five obsolete destroyers {{and a number of}} small and auxiliary warships. The Australian Army comprised a small permanent <b>cadre</b> <b>of</b> 3,000men and 80,000part-time militiamen who had volunteered for training with the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). The Royal Australian Air Force(RAAF), the weakest of the services, had 246aircraft, few of them modern. While the Commonwealth Government began a large military expansion and transferred some RAAF aircrew and units to British control upon the outbreak of war, it was unwilling to immediately dispatch an expeditionary force overseas due to the threat posed by Japanese intervention.|$|E

Russian army staffs were still following the same disastrously ill-disciplined signals-security procedures as had Tsarist army staffs during World War I, to the decisive advantage of their German enemy. As a result, during the Polish-Soviet War the Polish military were regularly kept informed by Russian signals stations about the movements of Russian armies and their intentions and operational orders.|$|E
5|$|FALINTIL officially became F-FDTL on 1 February 2001. The first 650 {{members of}} the F-FDTL were {{selected}} from 1,736 former FALINTIL applicants and began training on 29 March. The FDTL's 1st Battalion was established on 29 June 2001 and reached full strength on 1 December. Most {{members of the}} battalion were from East Timor's eastern provinces. The 2nd Battalion was established in 2002 from a <b>cadre</b> <b>of</b> the 1st Battalion and was manned mainly by new personnel {{under the age of}} 21 who had not participated in the independence struggle. Due to the force's prestige and relatively high pay, there were 7,000 applications for the first 267 positions in the battalion. The F-FDTL's small naval component was established in December 2001. The Australian UNTAET contingent provided most of the F-FDTL's training, and the United States equipped the force.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XII, a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} released by Square Enix in 2006, {{revolves around the}} attempt to liberate the kingdom of Dalmasca from the Archadian Empire. The story is told {{through the eyes of}} Vaan, an orphan who wishes to be a sky pirate, and the <b>cadre</b> <b>of</b> other characters he encounters throughout the adventure. The visuals of the characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida, while their stories were created by Yasumi Matsuno. The characters were designed to look and behave unlike any that had existed in the Final Fantasy series. Their stories were written to create a script where neither side was truly right or wrong, but instead just had different opinions and interpretations of the events occurring in the game.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the Australian government decided to raise an all-volunteer force for service overseas due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903), which precluded compelling the Militia to serve outside of Australian territory. This force was known as the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). Although the 2nd AIF would be raised upon a <b>cadre</b> <b>of</b> trained officers and non-commissioned officers drawn from the Militia, the Militia's main role at this time was to provide training to the men called up as part of the compulsory training scheme that was readopted in early 1940. Throughout 1940–41 the battalion undertook a number of short periods of continuous training, however, following the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor and invasion of Malaya in December 1941, it was mobilised for war service.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the chiefs}} {{respected}} Atangana as their spokesman and leader, and the Beti at large deferred to him prestige and power. A {{new system of}} status had evolved under his rule: a <b>cadre</b> <b>of</b> minor bureaucrats, envoys, interpreters, and office staff worked for Atangana and the other chiefs independent of the French government and were completely dependent on the chiefs. Atangana set up a private police force, for example, known as the fulus in Ewondo. The entire class recognised its reliance on the chiefs and gave them loyalty in exchange for protection and pay, and the chiefs relied on these functionaries to swiftly fulfill their duties to the French regime.|$|E
5|$|The 2/18th Battalion {{was raised}} around Sydney, New South Wales, in June 1940, with its first {{subunits}} being formed on 13 July at Wallgrove Camp. Formed {{as part of}} the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) from volunteers for overseas service, the battalion's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Varley, a grazier from Inverell, New South Wales, and a World War I veteran who had previously commanded the 35th Battalion while serving in the Militia during the interwar years. The battalion concentrated at Wallgrove on 15 July, and a <b>cadre</b> <b>of</b> commissioned and senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) who were selected from the Militia—in many cases personally by Varley—was established, while the remainder of the battalion's NCOs were appointed from recruits following their arrival.|$|E

5|$|The 4th Parachute Brigade {{was formed}} at RAF Kibrit in the Middle East on 1December1942.

The battalions assigned were the 156th Parachute Battalion (156 Para), raised from British servicemen in India, the 10th Parachute Battalion (10 Para), formed around a cadre from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment, and the 11th Parachute Battalion (11 Para), created from a <b>cadre</b> <b>of</b> 156 Para. The brigade's battalions all had the same composition: three rifle companies, each comprising a company headquarters, and three platoons. Each had a Support Company of mortar, machine gun and carrier platoons, along with a Headquarters Company. The brigade's first commander, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Smyth, was replaced by Brigadier John Hackett on 4January 1943.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{either to}} stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to Brussels in Belgium in February 1845. However, {{to stay in}} Belgium he had to pledge not to publish {{anything}} {{on the subject of}} contemporary politics. In Brussels, Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including Moses Hess, Karl Heinzen and Joseph Weydemeyer. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to Brussels to join Marx and the growing <b>cadre</b> <b>of</b> members of the League of the Just now seeking home in Brussels. Later, Mary Burns, Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in Brussels.|$|E
5|$|While {{the troops}} who had boarded the Orcades went into captivity on Java, the five {{officers}} and 257 other ranks {{that had been}} transported on the eight smaller ships returned to Australia {{in the last week}} of March 1942. Arriving at Port Adelaide, the battalion's vehicles, weapons and heavy equipment was moved to Morphettville Racecourse and the remaining personnel concentrated at Sandy Creek. On 15 April 1942, the order was passed to re-form the battalion, under Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Reed, the battalion's original second-in-command. Reinforcements arrived from various locations, including the Machine Gun Training Battalion based at Camden, New South Wales, while others came from the 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion to provide a <b>cadre</b> <b>of</b> experienced personnel.|$|E
