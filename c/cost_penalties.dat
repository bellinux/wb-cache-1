From this observation, it {{is clear}} that to make the value Θ, the {{difference}} in the average MSE between the unconstrained and constrained systems, become as positive as possible, the constrained selection method should result in the <b>cost</b> <b>penalty</b> Δ as small as possible. We note that the formulated optimization in (27) could achieve the minimum possible value of the total cost. Hence, with the definition of Δ as shown in (36), it is expected that the proposed constrained selection scheme based on linear optimization will guarantee the minimum achievable value of Δ. In addition, an upper bound of the expected value of the <b>cost</b> <b>penalty</b> is derived in Appendix 2. Based on the obtained bound, it is observed that for fixed values of nT and nD, the <b>cost</b> <b>penalty</b> becomes smaller when the number of receive antennas nR increases.|$|R

5000|$|Diesel engines {{have long}} been popular in bigger cars and {{have been used in}} smaller cars such as {{superminis}} in Europe since the 1980s. They were popular in larger cars earlier, as the weight and <b>cost</b> <b>penalties</b> were less noticeable. Diesel engines tend to be more economical at regular driving speeds and are much better at city speeds. Their reliability and life-span tend to be better (as detailed). Some 40 percent or more of all cars sold in Europe are diesel-powered where they are considered a low CO2 option. Mercedes-Benz in conjunction with Robert Bosch GmbH produced diesel-powered passenger cars starting in 1936 and very large numbers are used all over the world (often as [...] "Grande Taxis" [...] in the Third World). Diesel-powered passenger cars are very popular in India too, since the price of diesel fuel there is lower as compared to petrol. As a result, predominantly petrol-powered car manufacturers including the Japanese car manufacturers produce and market diesel-powered cars in India. Diesel-powered cars also dominate the Indian taxi industry.|$|E

Key challenges include engaging with stakeholder values and preferences, and exploring trade-offs between competing objectives {{in the face}} of underlying uncertainty. As a case study we represent the South African ESI using a partial equilibrium E 3 modelling approach, and extend the approach to include multiple objectives under selected future uncertainties. This extension is achieved by assigning <b>cost</b> <b>penalties</b> to non-cost attributes to force the model's least-cost objective function to better satisfy non-cost criteria. This paper incorporates aspects of flexibility to demand growth uncertainty into each future expansion alternative by introducing stochastic programming with recourse into the model. Technology lead times are taken into account by the inclusion of a decision node along the time horizon where aspects of real options theory are considered within the planning process. Hedging in the recourse programming is automatically translated from being purely financial, to include the other attributes that the <b>cost</b> <b>penalties</b> represent. From a retrospective analysis of the <b>cost</b> <b>penalties,</b> the correct market signals, can be derived to meet policy goal, with due regard to demand uncertainty...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} a linear {{quadratic}} differential gamesbased receding horizon control (RHC) algorithm is presented using linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, for which nominal closed-loop stability is guaranteed. The two-person control inputs are obtained by minimizing a quadratic performance index (cost function) over a finite horizon plus a time-varying terminal <b>cost</b> <b>penalty,</b> subject to input, state and output constraints. Under certain conditions, the weighting matrix {{in the terminal}} <b>cost</b> <b>penalty</b> enables one to specify an invariant ellipsoid in which the input, state and output constraints are satisfied. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to apply LMI method to two-person differential games and to incorporate the calculation of that into the on-line optimization problem of the controller. The main advantage of this approach is that a natural and automatic trade-off between feasibility and optimality is obtained. The simulation results demonstrate that the approach can be useful for practical applications...|$|R
