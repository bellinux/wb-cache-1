2500|$|The chital is {{the sole}} member of the genus Axis and is {{classified}} under the family Cervidae (deer). The species was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. Earlier, Hyelaphus – comprising the Bawean deer (H. kuhli), the <b>Calamian</b> <b>deer</b> (H. calamianensis [...] ) and the hog deer (H. porcinus) – was considered a subgenus of Axis. However Hyelaphus has now been elevated to generic status a 2004 phylogenetic study showed that Hyelaphus {{is closer to the}} genus Rusa than Axis. The study showed that Axis is paraphyletic, and distant from Hyelaphus in the phylogenetic tree. The chital forms a clade with Rucervus duvaucelii (barasinga) and R. schomburgki (Schomburgk's deer). The chital diverged from the Rucervus lineage in the early Pliocene (five million years ago). A 2002 study shows that Axis shansius, followed by A. lyra, is the earliest ancestor in the A. axis lineage. Axis is no longer considered a subgenus of Cervus.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Calamian</b> <b>deer</b> (Hyelaphus calamianensis), {{also known}} as Calamian hog deer, is an {{endangered}} species of deer found only in the Calamian Islands of Palawan province of the Philippines. It {{is one of three}} species of deer native to the Philippines, the other being the Philippine sambar and Visayan spotted deer.|$|E
50|$|Endangered local {{species are}} also {{protected}} in the sanctuary. As of 2005, these included 1,200 <b>Calamian</b> <b>deer,</b> 22 mousedeer, 4 Palawan bearcats, 5 crocodiles, and 2 wild pigs. The sanctuary {{has also been}} home to Palawan peacock pheasants, porcupines, sea eagles, wildcats, scaly anteaters, and pythons. There have also been programs to rejuvenate and protect the island’s marine resources, forests, and mangroves. In the island’s waters live dugongs, sea turtles, and giant clams. Calauit’s coral reefs, once badly damaged by invasive fishing practices, have recovered and are now rich breeding grounds for fish and crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{separate}} but similar island hog deer species: The Bawean deer (H. kuhlii) of Bawean Island in Indonesia, and the <b>Calamian</b> <b>deer</b> (H. calamianensis) of the Calamian Islands in the Philippines that inhabit moist or dry {{tropical deciduous forest}} environments. Unlike the best known western populations of the hog deer (A. porcinus), their fawns are not spotted at birth. However, the eastern populations (perhaps equalling the subspecies A. p. annamiticus) of the hog deer also have unspotted fawn. The two island hog deer may be remnants of a widespread population of hog deer {{that at one time}} were connected to the hog deer populations of mainland Southeast Asia and inhabited vast areas of the Sunda Shelf during times of lower ocean levels.|$|E
50|$|The zebras in {{the park}} are Grevy’s zebras are {{considered}} the most endangered of the world’s three surviving zebra species. Some of the giraffes seen on the same tour bore the purple marks of iodine that park staff use to treat cuts from the sharp spikes of some local plants. The park also is a haven for indigenous wildlife like the <b>Calamian</b> <b>deer,</b> named for the Calamian islands, the northernmost island cluster in Palawan province, a group that includes Busuanga. There were only 25 left on the island when the park started a conservation effort in 1981, capturing deer for breeding and protecting them once they were released back into the wild. Now there is a thriving herd of 1200. Some of the Filipino species are kept in pens, like the Palawan porcupines. Visitors are allowed to feed them, and apparently they {{have a passion for}} bananas.|$|E
