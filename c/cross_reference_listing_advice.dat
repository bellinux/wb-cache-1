40|$|Code Review is {{a useful}} {{technique}} for detecting defects in the code. It can considerably enhance quality and reduce effort during testing. An {{important part of the}} code review process is the use of a checklist to examine the program for common defects. A checklist is a <b>cross</b> <b>reference</b> <b>list</b> stated in the form of questions, concentrates on providing hints to enable reviewers detecting the defects. In this paper a technique for code review is proposed that makes use of a weighted checklist, a checklist in which weights are assigned to different checklist items. Using this technique, a flavor of quantification can be given to code review by computing a code review metric termed Code Review Score (CRS) on the basis of compliance of code under review for a checklist item and the weight assigned to the respective checklist item. It is proven that information expressed in quantitative terms is always more effective to be put into use for analysis, comparison and verification purposes so is the objective of proposing this technique to obtain the code review results in quantities {{that can be used to}} manage and track the detection of defects more effectively...|$|R

40|$|Diet is an {{important}} modifiable risk factor in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer prevention. Epidemiological evidence suggest a protective effect of food such as vegetables and fruits, and an increased risk with certain foods of animal origin. However, with {{a vast array of}} different nutrients within broad categories of food groups, the precise mechanisms underlying an association have yet to be determined. This warrants a more detailed investigation of individual food types to isolate and identify contributing factors. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the effects of three commonly consumed food types, (1) cruciferous vegetables, (2) soy, and (3) eggs on GI cancer risk. As the evidence on these foods have been limited and controversial, clarification through meta-analyses and systematic reviews would enable further understanding of potential relationships. Database search was completed with MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and Current Contents Connect with additional <b>cross</b> checking of <b>reference</b> <b>lists.</b> Inclusion criteria depended on the risk factor investigated but general requirements included the use of original data and reporting of an odds ratio or relative risk ratio, and 95...|$|R
40|$|After World War II, American {{forces in}} Europe {{set up the}} Field Intelligence Agency, Technical, (FIAT) to host and provide {{administrative}} support for visiting American experts who were studying German industry. FIAT prepared reports of those experts and assigned FIAT report numbers to them. Those reports were distributed in two ways: 1) FIAT reports {{were sent to the}} Office of the Publication Board (OPB), in the Department of Commerce, which had been set up to distribute the fruits of American research and development during World War II and of American studies of Axis science, technology, and industry. The OPB evolved into the National Technical Information Service. The OPB and its successor, the Office of Technical Services, distributed the FIAT reports through the Federal technical reports system. They were listed in the Bibliography of Scientific and Industrial Reports (BSIR) and its successor documents and were available for purchase from the Office of the Publication Board. 2) Many FIAT reports were also distributed through the Federal Depository Documents Program. In regional depository libraries, FIAT reports are probably filed under SuDocs Number W 1. 72 / 6 : which stands for American Military Government of Germany, FIAT Reports. This bibliography, FIAT REPORTS, A Bibliography and Index of Reports on German Industry, lists the FIAT reports received by the Office of Technical Services as of January 1948. Part I contains a list giving a brief citation of each report and its FIAT report and PB document numbers as well as the volume and page number in BSIR where a more detailed description of the report can be found. Part I is arranged by FIAT report number. Part II contains a <b>cross</b> <b>reference</b> <b>list</b> giving the PB document and the FIAT report numbers. It is arranged in PB document number order. Part III, Index, lists subject headings and company names with the FIAT report numbers of indexed reports. More detailed descriptions of FIAT reports are included by the Bibliography of Scientific and Industrial Reports (BSIR). BSIR has been digitized by the Hahti. It is available online at: [URL] You can use the author name and the volume and page numbers given in Part I to find the right citation in BSIR. Since the Hahti Trust cataloging record lists the various issues of BSIR by volume and issue numbers. You may have to do some hunting among the various issues in each volume to find the right page. Most FIAT reports should be readily available through interlibrary loan since they are held by Federal regional depository libraries. Those that cannot be obtained through interlibrary loan can be ordered from the Library of Congress. In orders given to the Library of Congress the reports requested are identified by their PB document numbers. The FIAT Reports are only {{one of a number of}} reports series on German science, technology, and industry. The various other report series are also listed in the Bibliography of Scientific and Industrial Reports...|$|R

Searches were performed of Pubmed and Embase using the MESH terms “Fibroids and Sarcoma and uterine neoplasms”, “Myomectomy and Complications”. Further papers were obtained from the <b>reference</b> <b>lists</b> of papers reviewed. Two further papers were submitted for inclusions which were unpublished manuscripts [16, 17] (Ind et al. 2014, personal communication). Only papers with over 500 subjects were included to address the issues of publication bias in smaller series. Further analysis using the terms above and <b>cross</b> <b>referencing</b> with published reviews <b>reference</b> <b>lists</b> on this subject, but with the exclusion of review articles, letters and case reports from the analysis, 12 papers are left where the data seemed reliable and acceptable to help answer the question [8, 16 – 26].

40|$|When {{identifying}} and elaborating compliance requirements, analysts {{need to follow}} the <b>cross</b> <b>references</b> in legal texts and consider the additional information in the cited provisions.

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} study was to {{systematically}} examine scientific studies of audiologic group rehabilitation. The definition of audiological rehabilitation was explored, different variables that influence the result and how the outcome measures should be done and its relationship with the goals of audiologic rehabilitation. The method used was a literature study. Pubmed and Cinahl were used for the search of literature. Some articles were searched from scientific studies <b>reference</b> <b>lists</b> and also <b>advice</b> from the supervisor. The result from the different studies shows that the effect of rehabilitation varies as there are many aspects that have an affect on the outcome measure. Rehabilitation should be seen as a patient centered problem solving process in order to reach the goals of all the individuals. When the patient is more active in the outcome measure procedure the goals also comply with the group rehabilitation. Consideration must be taken to social background of each and every individual in order to create an audiological rehabilitation program that meets their hearing and communication requirements. The lifestyle, communication habits and singularity of the individual interact with physical conceptions as well as the grade and shape of the hearing impairment. Audiological group rehabilitation is a mean to improve or relieve problems due to hearing impairment and the different studies show that the result varies. The goals of group rehabilitation should meet the need of the patient. In doing so there is a need of outcome measures that are person centered and problem solving. Using open questionnaires is a method to reach that criterion...|$|R
