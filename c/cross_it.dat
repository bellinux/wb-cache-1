5|$|Euston Road is a road in Central London {{that runs}} from Marylebone Road to King's <b>Cross.</b> <b>It</b> {{is part of the}} London Inner Ring Road and forms part of the London {{congestion}} charge zone boundary.|$|E
50|$|The {{river is}} crossed by two major roads. State Highway 1 <b>crosses</b> <b>it</b> near the coast between Willowbridge and Morven, while State Highway 82 <b>crosses</b> <b>it</b> inland at Waihao Forks. Near the State Highway 1 <b>crossing,</b> <b>it</b> is also <b>crossed</b> by the Main South Line railway, and inland, <b>it</b> was {{formerly}} <b>crossed</b> by the Waimate Gorge Branch. This branch line closed in 1953 and the bridges have been removed.|$|R
50|$|In Blair County, Tussey Mountain is {{sometimes}} called Huntingdon Mountain, as one reaches Huntingdon by <b>crossing</b> <b>it</b> going east. Conversely, {{in some parts of}} Huntingdon County it is called Williamsburg Mountain as one reaches Williamsburg by <b>crossing</b> <b>it</b> going west.|$|R
50|$|Each {{player is}} {{presented}} with a map of which they control the lower half. Across the center is a line, below which they can set up their units. Each unit which crosses this line gains a point. If the ComCen <b>crosses</b> <b>it,</b> many additional points are scored. A second line is {{three quarters of the}} way up the screen; <b>crossing</b> <b>it</b> with units gives additional points. <b>Crossing</b> <b>it</b> with the ComCen is one way to win the game.|$|R
5|$|In practice, {{the huge}} Valdez glacier that stood between the port and the Alaskan {{interior}} proved almost insurmountable and only 200 managed to climb it; by 1899, {{the cold and}} scurvy was causing many deaths amongst the rest. Other prospectors attempted an alternative route across the Malaspina Glacier just to the east, suffering even greater hardships. Those who did manage to <b>cross</b> <b>it</b> found themselves having to negotiate miles of wilderness before they could reach Dawson. Their expedition was forced {{to turn back the}} same way they had come with only four men surviving.|$|E
5|$|Rich with sediments {{deposited}} by {{flooding and}} fed by prolific rainfall {{on the western}} side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley {{is one of the most}} fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19thcentury, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21stcentury, major highways follow the river, and roads <b>cross</b> <b>it</b> on more than 50 bridges.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{structures}} within the policies are listed. These include the Category B listed Gothic style mausoleum constructed in 1865 {{at a cost}} of £2,500, equivalent to around £266,000 as at 2012. Built {{in the shape of a}} <b>cross,</b> <b>it</b> has a round stained glass window in the front gable and features many gargoyles and other stone decorations. Bodies are interred in the burial ground outside but commemorative stones made of Carrara marble are inside the mausoleum. The corbels on the internal oak roof are embellished with angel figurines.|$|E

5|$|The Hurdt-Amangkurat army {{arrived at}} Singkal, {{on the west}} bank of the Brantas River north of Kediri, on 13 October. Finding a way to cross the river proved a major {{challenge}} for the loyalists. The Brantas was swollen by monsoon rains, and the army did not have the boats necessary to <b>cross</b> <b>it.</b> Rain, desertion and lack of supplies continued to plague them. Amangkurat's forces dropped to about 1,000, while the VOC had 1,750 soldiers left, 659 of them Europeans.|$|E
5|$|The Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds {{is based}} on the {{enactment}} Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613 of 28 September 1941 to reward those servicemen who had already been awarded the Oak Leaves with Swords to the Knight's Cross of the Iron <b>Cross.</b> <b>It</b> was awarded to twenty-seven German soldiers, sailors and airmen, ranging from young fighter pilots to field marshals. Two recipients were members of the Kriegsmarine. The list is initially sorted by the chronological number assigned to the recipient.|$|E
5|$|The {{area has}} several pubs, {{including}} the Dog & Bell {{which has a}} reputation for serving a range of cask ales; and The Bird's Nest which has live music, film and art performances from local bands and artists. The Town Hall of the former Metropolitan Borough of Deptford, built in 1905 with decorative sculpture by Henry Poole RA, lies just outside Deptford, on the New Cross Road in New <b>Cross.</b> <b>It</b> was purchased by Goldsmiths College in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The bloody Wheatfield {{remained}} {{quiet for}} the rest of the battle. But it took a heavy toll on the men who traded possession back-and-forth. The Confederates had fought six brigades against 13 (somewhat smaller) Federal brigades, and of the 20,444 men engaged, about 30% were casualties. Some of the wounded managed to crawl to Plum Run but could not <b>cross</b> <b>it.</b> The river ran red with their blood. As with the Cornfield at Antietam, this small expanse of agricultural ground would be remembered by veterans as a name of unique significance in the history of warfare.|$|E
5|$|The border was a {{physical}} manifestation of Winston Churchill's metaphorical Iron Curtain {{that separated the}} Soviet and Western blocs during the Cold War. It marked the boundary between two ideological systems– capitalism and communism. Built by East Germany in phases from 1952 to the late 1980s, the fortifications were constructed to stop the large-scale emigration of East German citizens to the West, about 1,000 of whom {{are said to have}} died trying to <b>cross</b> <b>it</b> during its 45-year existence. It caused widespread economic and social disruption on both sides; East Germans living in the region suffered especially draconian restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} one of only three {{existing}} public highway covered bridges remaining in Connecticut and one of two currently in service for motor vehicles. Automobile traffic is restricted to one lane, which has prevented a problem for pedestrians attempting to <b>cross</b> <b>it.</b> Despite its rarity, it has survived due to its ability to handle heavy loads and its sound construction. The presence of a cover helps solve the problem of the wooden bridge floor gradually deteriorating due to the weather, while its high crossing point above the river means it is less susceptible to erosion by spring freshets.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge over}} Swinefleet Warping Drain {{was the subject}} of an unusual request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, who asked {{permission}} for 16 of his female potato pickers to <b>cross</b> <b>it</b> to reach their place of work. To access it, they would need to walk through the goods yard and along the main line, but it would save them having to walk much further each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.|$|E
5|$|The game {{belongs to}} the Chrono series and is a gaiden, or side story, to the 1995 game Chrono Trigger. It was {{released}} to complement its predecessor's plot, and later served as inspiration for Chrono <b>Cross.</b> <b>It</b> features text-based gameplay with minimal graphics and sound effects, and was scored by composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Unlike many Satellaview titles, Radical Dreamers was not designed to lock after {{a certain number of}} playthroughs, so players owning an 8M Memory Pack onto which the game was downloaded can still play today.|$|E
5|$|A Company was not {{significantly}} delayed by the German patrols it encountered later, although the presence of cheering Dutch crowds delayed the whole battalion as it passed through Oosterbeek. As they approached the railway bridge, C Company detached to capture it, but German engineers blew the bridge just as the British were starting to <b>cross</b> <b>it.</b> A Company now encountered enemy armoured cars, but successfully skirted them by manoeuvering through the back gardens of the houses {{on either side of}} the road At 8pm, as darkness fell, Grayburn's platoon led A Company into Arnhem centre and under the main ramp of Arnhem road bridge. Tatham-Warter deployed his platoons around the ramp; 2 Platoon covered both sides of the northernmost extreme of the ramp where it fed into the town centre.|$|E

30|$|The charts {{generated}} {{were examined}} {{to see which}} boundary was crossed. If the upper boundary was <b>crossed,</b> <b>it</b> implied that knees with anterolateral incision were preferred by the patients. If the lower boundary was <b>crossed,</b> <b>it</b> implied that knees with midline incision were preferred. If none of the two boundaries were <b>crossed,</b> <b>it</b> implied that patients did not prefer any one knee over the other. This method allowed us to conclude the trial {{as soon as the}} boundary was crossed. The upper boundary was crossed after charting the preferences of 19 patients; however, at that point the last patient was already recruited and so was allowed to complete the trial.|$|R

5|$|After {{two weeks}} {{out of the}} line, the {{division}} attacked the Hindenburg Line itself on 29 September, easily achieving its objectives and capturing 1,000 prisoners. With the New Zealanders on the St. Quentin Canal and the adjacent Scheldt River, a platoon had managed to <b>cross</b> <b>it</b> and reach the village of Crèvecœur. However, it became pinned down until the 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions of the 1st Brigade managed to cross {{the next day and}} capture the village. Private James Crichton, a member of the trapped platoon, earned the VC, the last of the war for the New Zealand Division, for his efforts in relaying messages between his companions and his company commander. He also defused demolition charges on the bridge spanning the Scheldt River.|$|E
5|$|As days pass by, Diganth {{develops}} feeling towards Radha, who reciprocates, and Pavani towards Kitty, {{who falls}} in love with her as well. Kodandaram and Padma approve of their relationship and decide to fix their wedding. Ganesh, in love with Sowmya, first tries confessing his feelings for her in writing, on a kite which on flying accidentally unstrings and flies away. Dejected, and eager to marry her, he speaks to her, and despite having developed a liking for him, she refuses. She decides to take up an offer for a job with an NGO in Switzerland and leaves for the nearest airport, when Ganesh accompanies her. Wishing to fly kites with the village kids across the river one last time, they use a coracle to <b>cross</b> <b>it.</b> Just as Sowmya confesses her feelings for him, the coracle capsizes as they encounter a rapid. Ganesh saves her from drowning, when she professes her love for him.|$|E
5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was bobbled by kick {{returner}} Andre Kendrick at the Tech one-yard line, but Kendrick {{broke free}} of the Clemson defense for a 34-yard return to the 35-yard line. Tech's first play after the return was an 11-yard run by Lee Suggs up {{the right side of}} the field. After the first down, Suggs ran straight ahead for a short gain, then Vick scrambled to the Clemson 37-yard line and another first down. Suggs then gained 18 yards on a run to the left side of the field. At the Clemson 19-yard line, Suggs was stopped for a loss of one yard, then Vick was sacked for a loss of five yards. The third-down play was an incomplete pass, and Carter Warley entered the game to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick bounced off the field goal crossbar but did not <b>cross</b> <b>it,</b> thus denying the Hokies three points. With 10:33 remaining in the half, Tech still had a 147 lead.|$|E
