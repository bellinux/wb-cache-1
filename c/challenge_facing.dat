5|$|Malta's tourism {{industry}} faces {{a number of}} issues impacting on it now and threatening to impact on it in the future. One of the clearest issues facing Malta's {{tourism industry}} is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta is a nation of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when tourism numbers are at their peak. This is a <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> Maltese tourism operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' marketing measures taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, Maltese tourism operators must balance increased tourism numbers with the needs of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are negative impacts on Maltese residents also.|$|E

25|$|Markell entered {{office with}} an {{unprecedented}} budget <b>challenge,</b> <b>facing</b> {{a deficit of}} almost $800,000,000. One of his first actions was to cut his own salary by 20%. Markell announced his plan {{to balance the budget}} in March 2009. Avoiding lay-offs, Markell's plan included an 8% pay cut for state employees, legalization and taxation of sports betting, over $200 million worth of cuts, and revenue enhancements on such things as liquor and tobacco.|$|E
25|$|Rabbinic Judaism {{was based}} on {{vigorous}} and often contentious debate {{over the meaning of}} the Torah and other sacred texts. One <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> the rabbis was to establish the degree of heterodoxy that was acceptable in debate. In this context, Elisha the heretic and Eleazar, who is said to have forgotten the Torah, represent two extremes in attitudes towards the Torah; actual rabbis and their arguments had to fit somewhere between these two limits.|$|E
25|$|Farmers {{on their}} own land may draw water without charge from the aquifer. Pumping costs are low because the fuel used, natural gas, is inexpensive. The North Plains {{district}} first established limits on pumping in 2005 and tightened the regulations four years later. Certain wells are now required to have meters. Yet another <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> the district is that higher prices for crops have prompted some to plant additional fields and further increase the use {{of water from the}} aquifer.|$|E
40|$|The study {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the <b>challenges</b> <b>faced</b> by SMEs Entrepreneurs. A sample of 92 of 120 SMEs Entrepreneurs at Melaka Tengah had been selected for this study. The findings showed that the independent variables or factors that support our hypothesis are financial, technology, managerial competencies and human resources. It means that all these four factors determine {{their relationship with the}} <b>challenges</b> <b>faced</b> by SMEs Entrepreneurs. Simple random sampling will be used to distribute the questionnaire to selected respondents. Based on this finding,managerial competency is the most contributors to the <b>challenges</b> <b>faced</b> by SMEs Entrepreneurs. While, all those four independent variables have a significant relationship with the <b>challenges</b> <b>faced</b> by SMEs Entrepreneurs. This is due to the result of correlation coefficient that has been used. In conclusion, financial, technology, managerial competencies and human resources contribute to the <b>challenges</b> <b>faced</b> by SMEs Entrepreneurs...|$|R

25|$|The {{greatest}} <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> Bowell {{as prime}} minister was the Manitoba Schools Question. The Conservative Party was bitterly divided {{on how to handle}} the Manitoba Schools Question, and as a result, on January 4, 1896, seven cabinet ministers resigned, demanding the return of Tupper. As a result, Bowell and Aberdeen were forced to invite Tupper to join the 6th Canadian Ministry and on January 15 Tupper became Secretary of State for Canada, with the understanding that he would become prime minister following the dissolution of the 7th Canadian Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{critical}} <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> West in her career was censorship of her dialogue. As on Broadway a decade before, by the mid 1930s, her risqué and ribald dialogue {{could no longer be}} allowed to pass. The Heat's On opened to poor reviews and weak performance at the box office. West was so distraught after the experience, and by her years of struggling with the strict Hays censorship office, that she would not attempt another film role for the next quarter-century. Instead, West pursued a successful and record-breaking career in top nightclubs, Las Vegas, nationally in theater, and on Broadway, where she was allowed, even welcomed, to be herself.|$|E
25|$|President Bush {{advocated}} the partial privatization of Social Security in 2005-2006, but was unsuccessful in achieving any reforms {{to the program}} against strong congressional resistance. His proposal would have diverted some of the payroll tax revenues that fund the program into private accounts. Critics argued that privatizing Social Security does nothing to address the long-term funding <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> the program. Diverting funds to private accounts would reduce available funds to pay current retirees, requiring significant borrowing. An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that President Bush's 2005 privatization proposal would have added $1 trillion in new federal debt in its first decade of implementation and $3.5 trillion in the decade thereafter.|$|E

25|$|Motivated by his {{personal}} experience with the disease, Ommaya focused {{on the problem of}} transplantation of islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. A major <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> survival of islet cells is immune rejection. Ommaya thought that the CSF would provide an ideal setting for transplanted islets due to the immune protection provided by the blood-brain barrier. He developed an artificial organ which would house transplanted islets, and the cells could be nourished by the CSF. Ayub, Illani Atwater, and colleagues identified that ventricular-peritoneal CSF shunts provided an immune protected site for the transplantation of mouse and rat islets in dogs and llamas. Ayub and colleagues also identified that CSF glucose mirrors blood glucose. Islets cells were able to survive in this system and function in the llama model, but further work on the model is needed.|$|E
25|$|The biggest <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> Taylor {{had been}} the issue of slavery in the territories, and this issue {{immediately}} confronted the Fillmore administration as well. Taylor had opposed a plan, formulated by Henry Clay, {{which was designed to}} appeal to both anti-slavery northerners and pro-slavery southerners, but which received the most support from Southerners. Fillmore immediately faced a stark choice; while Southern Whigs and a minority of Northern Whigs urged him to dismiss Taylor's Cabinet and support Clay's plan, most Northern Whigs pleaded for Fillmore to reject the compromise and retain Taylor's Cabinet. During his vice presidency, Fillmore had indicated that he might vote to support the compromise, but he had not publicly committed himself on the issue when he assumed the presidency. Fillmore had been marginalized during Taylor's short tenure in favor of Senator William Seward, a Fillmore rival for control of the New York Whig Party, and he had few allies in the Taylor administration. Taylor's Cabinet appointees submitted their resignation on July 10, and Fillmore accepted the resignations the following day. Fillmore is the only president who succeeded by death or resignation not to retain, at least initially, his predecessor's cabinet.|$|E

Thunderbirds has been praised for the quality of its effects. Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, writers of Collins Telly Guide, consider the model work [...] "uniformly impressive".

500|$|No {{full-length}} {{biography of}} Hancock appeared until the 20th century. A <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> Hancock biographers is that, compared to prominent Founding Fathers like Jefferson and John Adams, Hancock left relatively few personal writings for historians {{to use in}} interpreting his life. As a result, most depictions of Hancock have relied on the voluminous writings of his political opponents, who were often scathingly critical of him. According to historian Charles Akers, [...] "The chief victim of Massachusetts historiography has been John Hancock, the most gifted and popular politician in the Bay State's long history. He suffered the misfortune of being known to later generations almost entirely through the judgments of his detractors, Tory and Whig." ...|$|E
500|$|Beach {{maintained}} that the greatest <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> the crew was a seeming mundane activity, garbage disposal and cleaning: [...] "It was 84 days of strenuous work just keeping the ship clean. It was amazing how much dirt we created, so I {{had a field day}} every weekend. The crew started objecting until they saw how much trash we kept getting rid of. Then they couldn't object." [...] To remove trash without surfacing, Triton had a garbage disposal unit (GDU), a small inverted torpedo tube that ejected a weighted bag of refuse through the bottom of the ship. [...] However, if the GDU was temporarily out of commission due to repairs, as it was on 22 February, the after torpedo tubes were used, a less than optimum solution.|$|E

That problem was not adequately solved until November 2012, and the script would later require even more significant revisions after that point. As a result, the single [...] "most daunting" [...] <b>challenge</b> <b>facing</b> the animation team was a short schedule of less than 12 months to turn Lee's still-evolving shooting script into an actual film. Other films like Pixar's Toy Story 2 had been successfully completed on even shorter schedules, but a short schedule necessarily meant [...] "late nights, overtime, and stress." [...] Lee estimated the total size of the entire team on Frozen to be around 600 to 650 people, [...] "including around 70 lighting people 70-plus animators," [...] and 15 to 20 storyboard artists.|$|E

500|$|Competition for the Grey Cup {{was limited}} to member unions of the CRU, the champions of which petitioned the league body {{for the right to}} {{challenge}} for the national championship. The Western Canada Rugby Football Union joined in 1921, allowing the Edmonton Eskimos to <b>challenge.</b> <b>Facing</b> the Argonauts in the 9th Grey Cup, the Eskimos became the first western team – and the first from outside Toronto or Hamilton – to compete for the trophy.

[...] They dominated Edmonton, recording the first shutout in Grey Cup history with a 23–0 victory.
