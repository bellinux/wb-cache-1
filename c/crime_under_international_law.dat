During the Bosnian War she was an inmate at the Bosnian Serb-run Omarska camp in Prijedor, Bosnia and Herzegovina where she and other women at the camp were raped, beaten, and tortured. After the camp's closure in August 1992 due to press coverage, she became an activist {{for victims of}} rape and is {{credited}} with helping in the recognition of wartime rape as a war <b>crime</b> <b>under</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> She {{is a member of}} the Women's Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E

40|$|Doctor Legum - LLDChildren {{have been}} {{committing}} crimes {{during times of}} war and other armed conflicts since time immemorial. Yet, it is only {{over the last few}} decades that cognisance is being taken of child soldiers as a type of juvenile. The unfortunate sight of a child holding a gun has become a familiar picture throughout armed conflicts, especially in Africa. Both boys and girls are used as child soldiers and they can be as young as 5 years old. They are mainly regarded as victims of <b>crimes</b> <b>under</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> and are therefore usually rehabilitated once they have been disarmed and demobilised. Notwithstanding their need for rehabilitation, {{it is a fact that}} child soldiers commit some of the most egregious <b>crimes</b> <b>under</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> They receive military-style training and are presumably not afraid of killing and carrying out orders. Yet it is recognised that generally they do not have the same level of maturity as adults. The reality of child soldiers who join armed forces therefore presents complex legal questions in the face of contemporary <b>international</b> criminal <b>law</b> principles which, on the one hand, afford protection to all children, and on the other, unequivocally call for the prosecution and punishment of those who are individually responsible for committing <b>crimes</b> <b>under</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> Consequently, various safeguards need to be upheld to ensure that the best interests of the child are maintained once a child soldier is held criminally responsible. This thesis analyses the extent to which child soldiers can be prosecuted <b>under</b> domestic and <b>international</b> <b>law,</b> as well as the implementation of alternative measures to prosecution. The thesis proposes that a case-by-case approach should be considered when child soldiers are prosecuted for <b>crimes</b> <b>under</b> <b>international</b> <b>law,</b> thereby investigating and analysing the often distinctive circumstances related to their crimes.

2500|$|Ever {{since the}} atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, {{there has been}} legal debate over the action. On August 10, 1945, the Japanese {{government}} addressed a communication to the International Committee of the Red Cross, asking it to denounce the US government as performing a <b>crime</b> <b>under</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> Following surrender and the landing of US occupation troops in Japan, the Prime Minister Naruhiko Higashikuni offered not to make any complaints in the media or in legal institutions {{about the use of}} the nuclear weapons if the United States Government agreed to drop its demand to try Japanese war criminals. During the Tokyo War Crimes Trial, some of the defence lawyers tried to convince the International Military Tribunal of the Far East to launch a legal investigation into the matter of the legality of the first use of nuclear weapons, but their motions were ignored. One of these defence lawyers, Shoichi Okamoto, continued {{to deal with the issue}} after the trial was concluded. In February 1953, he published a booklet titled [...] "Genbaku Minso Wakumon (Questions and Answers on the Civil Lawsuit over the Atomic Bombings)", in which he called upon individuals in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to take legal action against the US government within the US legal system.|$|E
2500|$|Iran's actions, nuclear program, {{and threats}} {{have been viewed}} by Dr. Gregory Stanton, the founder and {{director}} of Genocide Watch, as having taken 6 out of 8 steps on the [...] "path to genocide." [...] Stanton urged the international community to take action against Iran and to isolate it, in order to [...] "curb its genocidal intent." [...] He said that [...] "one of the best predictors of genocide is incitement to genocide ... and I believe that is exactly what Iran is doing today." [...] Incitement to genocide is a <b>crime</b> <b>under</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> He stressed that {{it is important not to}} dismiss [...] "the early signs" [...] as [...] "diabolical rhetoric or as a tactic meant to advance a different goal," [...] and doing so would [...] "enable the perpetrators." [...] Stanton also said that Iran has classified and symbolized Israel via hate speech and an ideology of exclusion, and has dehumanized Israel by portraying potential victim as [...] "cancer" [...] that should be wiped out. In addition, Stanton said that Iran has organized [...] "fanatical militas," [...] such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, while stifling dissent in Iranian society. [...] He added that by denying a previous genocide, the Holocaust, by working on weapons of mass destruction, and through global terrorism, Iran has prepared for genocide.|$|E

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMSitting head {{of state}} {{immunity}} for <b>crimes</b> <b>under</b> <b>international</b> <b>law</b> {{has been a very}} controversial issue in recent times. On the one hand, the debate bears that personal immunity has been renounced for <b>crimes</b> <b>under</b> <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> On the other hand, the advocates of personal immunity claim that the principle of immunity is still persisting <b>under</b> customary <b>International</b> <b>law.</b> Although the <b>International</b> Criminal Court (ICC) is a treaty based court, it is able to extend its jurisdiction to non-state parties to the Rome Statute through a referral by the United Nations Security Council. Lacking its own enforcement body the ICC relies on the cooperation of other states for arrest and surrender of those it indicts. The extension of the court's jurisdiction to non-state parties, such as the case of Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir, has led to the reluctance of state parties to the Rome Statue to effect arrest and surrender citing a 'dilemma between two conflicting obligations'. This paper analyses the legal status of personal immunity before different fora such as International tribunals, foreign domestic courts and <b>under</b> customary <b>international</b> <b>law.</b> It also critically examines the legal basis for the alleged conflicting obligations of state parties. The paper at the end concludes that there is no conflicting obligation for states parties to fully co-operate with the ICC and the lack of co-operation in the arrest and surrender of a sitting {{head of state}} is inconsistent with <b>international</b> <b>law</b> particularly with United Nation Charter and the Rome Statute.
