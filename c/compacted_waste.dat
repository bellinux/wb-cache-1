40|$|The {{modelling}} of infiltration {{and moisture}} movement within a porous medium requires {{information on the}} moisture retention and hydraulic conductivity properties. In this study, the unsaturated hydraulic behaviour of a <b>compacted</b> <b>waste</b> sample based on the composition of Lyndhurst Landfill site in Melbourne, Australia was investigated in laboratory. Two fundamental aim {{of the study were}} to establish the moisture retention characteristics of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) sample and measure its unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. In landfilled waste, the particle and pore size distribution, heterogeneity of waste composition and leachate chemistry complicate the determination of moisture retention and hydraulic conductivity. In this study the modification and use of a standard pressure plate apparatus was described which can be used establish moisture retention properties of samples of 230 mm in diameter. The experiments showed that the moisture retention characteristics of <b>compacted</b> <b>waste</b> sample were comparable to soils. It has been shown that water retention in waste is a function of its position relative to the phreatic surface, in other words, its hydraulic boundary conditions which will vary with elevation. Some difficulties and limitations of using this method were discussed. As with conventional inert soils, laboratory determination of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is difficult and recourse is often made to analytical methods as those presented by van Genuchten (1980). One aim {{of this study was to}} compare the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of MSW obtained using Passioura' s (1976) onestep outflow test method with predictions using van Genuchten's model. Good agreement is observed between the predictive model and experimental method for unsaturated hydraulic conductivities at low moisture contents but there is poor agreement at high degrees of saturation. This latter discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty of measuring retention properties of large pores at low suctions and the applicability of the van Genuchten model to such a material.

40|$|Landfilling is {{the most}} common method of {{domestic}} solid waste disposal in most of the developing countries. To reduce the negative environmental impacts from solid waste landfills, it is essential to develop a sound pretreatment technique for domestic waste prior to its disposal. This paper presents an effective method for pretreatment of domestic solid waste in a closed system by leaching the pollutant constituents within a short period. Several laboratory-scale experiments have been conducted to optimize the kinetic conditions for enhanced leaching, which were later applied to pilot scale reactors to ensure effectual settlement of waste and subsequent flushing of total and volatile solids from the waste matrix. The optimum kinetic conditions obtained from the laboratory experiments were intermittent downward leachate recirculation through a <b>compacted</b> <b>waste</b> of density 500 kg/m 3 with a periodic leachate displacement by fresh water. The pilot scale reactor showed a waste settlement of 66 % within a period of one week. Further, around 400 g of total solids (TS) and 220 g of total volatile solids (TVS) per kg of dry biowaste could be leached.

The study area, Babylon Governorate, is situated in the middle of Iraq, and is distinguished by a hot climate and shallow groundwater. The governorate did not have landfill sites that meet international criteria; in addition, the groundwater depth in Babylon Governorate is commonly shallow. Previously, the most important criteria for the study area and GIS software were used to select the best sites for locating landfills in the major cities of the governorate. In this study, the Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance (HELP 3. 95 D) model was applied in order to ensure that there was no leakage of the leachate that results from the waste in the selected landfill sites. It is the most commonly utilized model for landfill design, and it is used to estimate water inflow through the soil layers.

Previously, other authors have shown that embankment geometry and variation in permeability can be responsible for a concave upwards steady state seepage line. These factors are investigated in greater detail using a finite element program to model flow in the saturated portion of the embankment. It is shown that the angle of the upstream slope only has an appreciable effect on the form of the seepage line if the pond is close to the downstream face of the dam. An increasing permeability in the direction of flow and seepage path length are responsible for reducing the height of the seepage line. This effect is demonstrated for both a continuous variation of permeability and a step jump in permeability between the tailings deposit and the dam. Anisotropy of tailings and dam permeability is also investigated. Transient analyses of saturated flow are performed for tailings dams constructed of dry <b>compacted</b> <b>waste.</b> For this case, the seepage line is straight for a constant pond level, and concave upwards for a rising pond and a low dam permeability. The simple computer model also predicts that for a constantly rising pond level, the seepage line advances at a constant rate dependent on the rate of pond rise, and the material properties of the dam. A fully automatic finite element program has been written, combining an adaptive mesh regeneration algorithm and a variable mesh technique. The program is shown to provide both an accurate and precise solution of the free surface problem. A method of automatically generating "square" flow nets by post-processing the finite element data is presented for the first time. Flow nets provide a visual proof of the correctness of the computer model and are a useful aid to other workers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractKolkata {{is one of}} {{oldest and}} largest {{metropolitan}} city in eastern part of India with population of 4, 486, 679 and population density of 24252 per km 2. The city of Kolkata generates almost 5500 ton of municipal solid waste (MSW) per day. The waste {{of the city is}} maintained by Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and around 80 % of this waste is collected by corporation waste management system KMC has introduced the Modern Scientific Waste Compacting Stations (MSWCS) under the Clean City initiative. The MSW thus collected were taken to the nearest compactor station which houses around two to five compactors depending upon the area, in total there are 90 compactors and 30 mobile compactors functioning till date. The number is expected to go up by the end of 2015 to 163 compactors at a cost of INR 152 crore. The previous method of dumping in open Vat was unhygienic and produced odor and vector born diseases in the vicinity and the people living near were largely affected. Though the addition of compactor has enhanced the cleanliness of the city but the sustainability of these waste compactors is a major issue and which is needed to be addressed. The disposal of the <b>compacted</b> <b>waste</b> is still being carried out in traditional landfill site and the landfill site and city distance being smaller raise a question on transportation savings which may have been incurred due to the compactor thus the payback period and long-term sustainability of the compactor is in question. The sustainability issues and challenges were identified based on a preliminary field study in 15 of the compactor station in Kolkata. The waste quantity, waste characteristics, number of trip of the compactors, labors requirements and number of other sustainability factors were evaluated. The data collected were benchmarked based on the literature, with the practices of other countries. The study reveals that there is number of issues which are lacking and needed to be implemented within the waste compactor management system to make the project sustainable in long run. The analysis revealed the need for a sanitized landfill site for methane extraction and segregation of waste before compacting for increasing the sustainability of the system. The studies finding if implemented can led to a more sustainable, economical and environmentally sound waste management system for the city of Kolkata.

40|$|Since March 1999, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), {{located in}} southeastern New Mexico, has been {{operated}} by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO), as a repository for the permanent disposal of defense-related transuranic (TRU) waste. More than 1, 450 shipments of TRU waste for WIPP disposal have been completed, and the WIPP is currently receiving 12 to 16 shipments per week from five DOE sites around the nation. One of the largest fleets of Type B packagings supports the transportation of TRU waste to WIPP. This paper discusses {{the development of this}} fleet since the original Certificate of Compliance (C of C) for the Transuranic Package Transporter-II (TRUPACT-II) was issued by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 1989. Evolving site programs, closure schedules of major sites, and the TRU waste inventory at the various DOE sites have directed the sizing and packaging mix of this fleet. This paper discusses the key issues that guided this fleet development, including the following: While the average weight of a 55 -gallon drum packaging debris could be less than 300 pounds (lbs.), drums containing sludge waste or <b>compacted</b> <b>waste</b> could approach the maximum allowable weight of 1, 000 lbs. A TRUPACT-II shipment may consist of three TRUPACT-II packages, each of which is limited to a total weight of 19, 250 lbs. Payload assembly weights dictated by ''as-built'' TRUPACT-II weights limit each drum to an average weight of 312 lbs when three TRUPACT-IIs are shipped. To optimize the shipment of heavier drums, the HalfPACT packaging was designed as a shorter and lighter version of the TRUPACT-II to accommodate a heavier load. Additional packaging concepts are currently under development, including the ''TRUPACT-III'' packaging being designed to address ''oversized'' boxes that are currently not shippable in the TRUPACT-II or HalfPACT due to size constraints. Shipment optimization is applicable not only to the addition of new packagings, but also to the addition of new payload containers (used inside the NRC-approved Type B packaging) with revised design limits. For example, to address the shipment of specific TRU waste forms, a series of pipe overpack payload containers have been designed and approved by the NRC. The ''standard'' pipe overpack configuration is designed to allow the shipment of higher fissile gram containers, each with a maximum fissile gram equivalent (FGE) loading of 200 grams (g). For shipments of waste packaged in the standard pipe overpack, the FGE limit is 2, 800 g per TRUPACT-II and 1, 400 g per HalfPACT. The ''S 100 '' and ''S 200 '' pipe overpack configurations allow the use of shielded configurations of the pipe overpack for shipment of specific gamma- and neutron-emitting waste forms. The 72 -B Cask and the 10 - 160 B Cask have been approved by the NRC for the transportation of remote-handled (RH) TRU waste, which comprises {{a small fraction of the}} overall inventory that will be shipped to WIPP...|$|E

40|$|A {{bioreactor}} landfill {{cell with}} 1. 2 -acre footprint was constructed, filled, operated, and monitored at Northern Oaks Recycling and Disposal Facility (NORDF) at Harrison, MI. With a filled volume of 74, 239 cubic yards, the cell contained approximately 35, 317 tons of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) and 20, 777 tons of cover soil. It was laid on the slope of an existing cell but separated by a geosynthetic membrane liner. After the cell reached a design height of 60 feet, it {{was covered with a}} geosynthetic membrane cap. A three-dimensional monitoring system to collect data at 48 different locations was designed and installed during the construction phase of the bioreactor cell. Each location had a cluster of monitoring devices consisting of a probe to monitor moisture and temperature, a leachate collection basin, and a gas sampling port. An increase in moisture content of the MSW in the bioreactor cell was achieved by pumping leachate collected on-site from various other cells, as well as recirculation of leachate from the bioreactor landfill cell itself. Three types of leachate injection systems were evaluated in this bioreactor cell for their efficacy to distribute pumped leachate uniformly: a leachate injection pipe buried in a 6 -ft wide horizontal stone mound, a 15 -ft wide geocomposite drainage layer, and a 60 -ft wide geocomposite drainage layer. All leachate injection systems were installed on top of the <b>compacted</b> <b>waste</b> surface. The distribution of water and resulting MSW moisture content throughout the bioreactor cell was found to be similar for the three designs. Water coming into and leaving the cell (leachate pumped in, precipitation, snow, evaporation, and collected leachate) was monitored in order to carry out a water balance. Using a leachate injection rate of 26 – 30 gal/yard 3, the average moisture content increased from 25 % to 35 % (wet based) over the period of this study. One of the key aspects of this bioreactor landfill study was to evaluate bioreactor start up and performance in locations with colder climate. For lifts filled during the summer months, methane generation started within three months after completion of the lift. For lifts filled in winter months, very little methane production occurred even eight months after filling. The temperature data indicated that subzero or slightly above zero (oC) temperatures persisted for unusually long periods (more than six months) in the lifts filled during winter months. This was likely due to the high thermal insulation capability of the MSW and the low level of biological activity during start up. This observation indicates that bioreactor landfills located in cold climate and filled during winter months may require mechanisms to increase temperature and initiate biodegradation. Thus, besides moisture, temperature may be the next important factor controlling the biological decomposition in anaerobic bioreactor landfills. Spatial and temporal characterization of leachate samples indicated the presence of low levels of commonly used volatile organic compounds (including acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and toluene) and metals (including arsenic, chromium, and zinc). Changes and leachate and gaseous sample characteristics correlated with enhanced biological activity and increase in temperature. Continued monitoring of this bioreactor landfill cell is expected to yield critical data needed for start up, design, and operation of this emerging process...|$|E

These wastes are mostly composed of activated oxidized metal pieces which also contain traces of fission, activation products and actinides. In the repository, they are exposed to radioactivity in presence of resaturation water. The water radiolysis may accelerate the oxidised metal corrosion processes.
