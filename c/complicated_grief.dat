40|$|Following {{the death}} of a loved one, many grievers endorse spirituality as a source of both solace and strain.

However, researchers have lacked a simple, multidimensional, well-validated, grief-specific measure of CSG. In this brief report, we reviewed the psychometric validation process and clinical utility of a measure called the Inventory of <b>Complicated</b> Spiritual <b>Grief</b> (ICSG), which was tested with 304 Christian grievers.

40|$|Although spirituality {{often has}} been {{associated}} with better outcomes following bereavement, it can be significantly challenged by loss as well.

However, to date, {{in the absence of a}} simple, multidimensional, and well-validated measure of spiritual crisis following loss, investigators have measured CSG with nongrief-specific instruments. In this study, the authors tested the reliability and validity of a newly developed measure of CSG, called the Inventory of <b>Complicated</b> Spiritual <b>Grief</b> (ICSG). With 2 diverse samples of bereaved adult Christians (total n = 304), the authors found that the ICSG had strong internal consistency, and high test-retest reliability for both subscales in a subsample of participants. Analyses of both samples supported a 2 -factor model, with one factor measuring Insecurity with God and the other assessing Disruption in Religious Practice. Analyses further supported the convergent and incremental validity of the 18 -item ICSG relative to other theoretically similar instruments and measures of poor bereavement outcome, suggesting its usefulness in clinical research and practice...|$|R

40|$|Bereavement {{practices}} {{with the material}} legacies of the dead {{are known to be}} deeply complex, multifaceted and tap into a rich cultural imaginary around the desire to honour, remember and aid the dead to persist on. Since the mid 1990 's, scholarships have begun to acknowledge the changing nature of people's material legacies after death. Through increasing engagement with different technologies, the deceased are now leaving extensive digital legacies within the internet. Empirical research has revealed how memorials and social networking profiles offer the bereaved a positive focus for loss and community building. Furthermore, empirical work has investigated how memorial sites and Facebook can invoke the social presence of the dead. However, there are a range of remains and social presences online that have surfaced during my doctoral inquiry that are missing from this developing discourse, such as the dead seeming to like things on Facebook, advertise products, become trending topics, remind us of our birthday commitments, appear in search listings and congratulate us on our new jobs. Within this review I provide an overview of the current literature around the themes of digital legacy and the digital afterlife that has emerged out of the developing intersection of death and technology studies. By outlining the current debates, I begin to challenge the current thinking by introducing an interdisciplinary approach from New Media studies, in order to reconsider online remains and how evoked social presences in online environments may actually <b>complicate</b> <b>grief</b> instead of aiding, as many research results suggest.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} possible {{differences in}} emotional impact on parents following either a deliberate intrauterine death or a neonatal death in extremely preterm growth retarded infants. DESIGN: Retrospectively matched study by audiotaped semi-structured interview, 3 - 9 {{years after the}} perinatal loss. RESULTS: Nineteen couples (ten in the intrauterine death group and nine in the neonatal death group) consented to participate. More than 50 % of the intrauterine death group couples could not share or discuss their emotions. Most partners in this group did not feel {{the loss of their}} own child. Discongruent grieving between partners was more pronounced in the intrauterine death group and could be identified as a risk factor for prolonged and abnormal grief reactions. Four couples (three in the intrauterine death group and one in the neonatal death group) developed long-term emotional disturbance and psychosocial problems.

40|$|Each year {{approximately}} 495, 000 Australians {{are diagnosed}} with cancer. If {{each of those}} individuals has two or three family members, the number of Australians facing the challenges of cancer care is notable. Given the fact that cancer is, {{for the most part}} a disease of the older person, it is anticipated that the number of people with cancer will continue to increase as the proportion of the population in the older aged groups expands. The needs of families who support these people are therefore expected to burgeon. When an individual is diagnosed with cancer, the impact reverberates through the family, touching all members. Family members confront uncertainties about the meaning of the diagnosis, the prognosis of the patient and the patient's needs for care and support. Family members are often required to manage physical care changes and arrangements and practical difficulties with daily living, while they handle their own emotional distress about the patient's care and concerns about the future. Families bring with them diverse histories and different approaches to coping. Some may experience the cancer illness as a prompt for greater closeness in relationships, a time for reflection about goals and values and enhanced family interactions. Others may bend under the burden of the illness and communication difficulties and dysfunctional family patterns may emerge. Memories about the cancer illness linger during the bereavement period, sometimes <b>complicating</b> their <b>grief</b> reactions and leaving them with feelings of regret.

50|$|The Loss Oriented Process {{focuses on}} coping with bereavement, the loss itself, {{recognizing}} it and accepting it. In this process a person will express feelings of grief {{with all the}} losses that occur from losing their loved one. There will be many changes from work to family and friendships. There might also be demographic changes and even economic ones. During this time, people either acknowledge these changes head or ruminate on feelings of lose which might lead to distorted, <b>complicated</b> or prolonged <b>grief.</b> The loss oriented process will bring {{on a lot of}} yearning, irritability, despair, anxiety and depression. During this process they are only concentrated on their pain that this loss has caused. Lack or denial of early adaptive acknowledgement that they will no longer speak to deceased or see them again might instigate compulsive and self destructive behaviors. People attached with the deceased have to reconfigure their identity as an autonomous being. These process in a non-resilient griever can appear overwhelming, and associated guilt can be exported over friends and family in an assumptive effort which might affect interpersonal relationships.|$|R
40|$|Many {{couples have}} {{experienced}} {{the death of a}} baby. It could happen during pregnancy, during delivery, shortly after birth, or during infancy. Some are unexpected: in spite of medical advances, more than one-fifth of all expectant parents will at some time experience miscarriage, stillbirth or infant death. For some other couples, early termination, whether of unwanted pregnancies due to personal choice or of wanted pregnancies due to medical reasons, is carried out at their own decision. A couple’s experience of loss in miscarriage and stillbirth is not easily shared by others – “but it wasn’t even a baby yet. ” The lack of clarity of the loss (in the absence of a touchable, separate infant’s body) is the reason for many who find it difficult to appreciate the full extent of grief in pregnancy loss. Couples who have miscarriage and stillbirth are also confused about their bereavement experience and sometimes not sure about how to react. As a result, many of them choose not to seek help and support from their family and friends; the couple does not know how to name the grief, neither do those who are close to them know how to respond. In Chinese societies, expectant mothers do not disclose their pregnancy during the first trimester for the traditional fear that it would jinx or ‘upset’ the baby, who would then ‘refuse to be born’. Pregnancy loss during this early stage, while not uncommon, will be a secret within a secret, further <b>complicating</b> the <b>grief</b> process. In essence, pregnancy loss due to miscarriage or stillbirth is always considered as disenfranchised grief over an ambiguous loss.

Greater posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activity was associated with lower parasympathetic activity (eg more arousal). Connectivity has been demonstrated between the ventral PCC (vPCC) and the subgenual ACC (sACC), which then projects to the autonomic nuclei. In the present study, functional connectivity analysis revealed a positive correlation between vPCC and sACC/orbitofrontal cortical activity.

40|$|The best test of any relationship’s {{significance}} in a person’s life is. Perhaps, {{what happens when}} it comes to an end. Although losing a pet has been likened to losing a valued possession or occupation (e. g., Parkes, 1971), current evidence suggests that an owner’s response to pet death usually has more in common with bereavement following the death of a beloved human than with the loss of a possession (Archer & Winchester, 1994). Grief is a normal response to the death of a beloved other and has been characterised as progressing through a series of stages or phases from initial shock, numbness, and denial, occurring even when the death is expected, to a range of intense emotional reactions that may include anger and guilt, to depression and helplessness, where a person may become withdrawn, to a stage of dialogue and bargaining, where the bereaved person may begin to reach out to others, want to tell their story, and struggle to find meaning in what happened. The final stage involves acceptance of the loss and moving on (Kühler-Ross, 1969). The nature of response to pet death seems to follow this pattern, though being on average less extremely distressing and less prolonged (Archer & Winchester, 1994; Gerwolls & Lahott, 1994). People vary considerably in how they manifest their grief. Nevertheless, some bereaved persons may find their response severely debilitating and protracted and may even become suicidal (Archer & Winchester, 1994).

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Because of disease, industrialization, and {{regional}} conflicts, young widowhood is an expanding phenomenon {{in many parts}} of the world. Young widows face many challenges that can lead to mental health problems. The young widows have to make adjustments to fit their new roles as bread winners of the families, having to play both parental roles and also other roles required by extended family members and the community. In this dissertation, young widows are defined as women under the age of 46 whose husbands died suddenly, or after a protracted illness. These survivors are at a greater risk of psychiatric and mental health issues. Such mental health conditions experienced by surviving spouses include, but are not limited to, PTSD, depression, and anxiety. These issues can in turn cause a prolonged period of <b>grief</b> or even <b>complicate</b> existing <b>grief</b> level. The grieving process is usually characterized by stages of denial, resistance, sorrow, and acceptance. The country of Cameroon has not been immune from this deleterious expansion of young widowhood. Although the experiences of widowhood have been documented, to date relatively little research about widows in Cameroon has been accomplished. As such, little information is available regarding the experiences of widows in Cameroon. This knowledge gap leaves young widows in this country vulnerable to structural forces that can exacerbate mental health issues. As such, a study was undertaken to look at two psychological sequela of young widowhood. This study examined these sequelae through the lense of the experiences of young widowhood in one tribe. Specifically, the Banso (i. e., the Nso of the Bamenda Grassfields in the Northwest Region of Cameroon). The two psychological sequela were: (1) post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and (2) grieving style. In order to document the participants’ PTSD and grieving patterns, a cross-sectional, observational study was conducted. The PTSD Diagnostic Scale (PDS) was used to provide a brief but reliable self-report measure of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among study participants. Although the PDS has four parts, only Part 3 was used for this study. This part is a 17 -question survey listing problem areas related to experiences of very stressful and traumatic experiences. The validated Grief Pattern Inventory (GPI) was used to determine the grieving styles of the study participants. Participants included 51 widows from ages 18 to 46 years, residing in a small commune in the Northwest Region of Cameroon. These widows were part of a widows’ self-help group that meets once a month.

40|$|It {{has often}} been {{suggested}} {{in the literature on}} pregnancy loss, that parents run a high risk of <b>complicated</b> or pathological <b>grief</b> {{as a result of the}} specific characteristics of such loss. What confuses the issue is that pathological grief has been defined in various ways. In the interest of improving professional care, it is important to ascertain how pathological grief manifests itself and which parents are most likely to have problems coping with pregnancy loss and therefore develop pathological grief reactions. Given the lack of clarity regarding the concept of pathological grief following pregnancy loss, this article reviews empirical studies on pathological grief following pregnancy loss according to four subtypes derived from general bereavement literature: chronic grief, delayed grief, masked grief, and exaggerated grief. It can be concluded that in the first six months following pregnancy loss, psychological complaints, behavioral changes, and somatic complaints are fairly common responses. Approximately 10 -to- 15 percent of the women develop a psychiatric disorder during the first two years following such loss, and less than 10 percent seek specific psychiatric care. Parents often mourn the loss of their baby for more than a year; one in five women is unable to accept pregnancy loss after approximately two years. A delayed grief reaction occurs in about 4 percent of parents and seems to occur most often in men. It is suggested that developing pathological grief following pregnancy loss may be more uncommon than had previously been thought, and the long-held idea that parents run a higher risk of pathological grief following pregnancy loss seems partly to result from flaws in the empirical studies in this field. A large majority of women seem to be able to recover from pregnancy loss in due time, drawing on their own strength...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explored the maternal perceptions {{of life with}} a child affected by catastrophic epilepsy, which is a severe form of childhood epilepsy that includes difficult-to- control seizure activity, intellectual disability, other developmental disabilities, and a poor prognosis. Limited qualitative research exists regarding the lived experience and meaning of maternal caregiving for children with this stigmatized, severely debilitating condition. This hermeneutic phenomenological study informed by van Manen (1990) involved two audio-recorded, in-depth interviews with each of five participants who were the biological mothers of children with a catastrophic form of epilepsy.   The essence of the study's findings was one of maternal commitment to a beloved child in a seizure-centered life. The themes {{that emerged from the}} data shared by study participants were: "A Child with Catastrophic Epilepsy: `Waiting for the Other Shoe to Drop,'" as a response to their child's daily, unpredictable, and potentially life threatening seizure activity; "Mobilizing resources: A Constant Preoccupation and Effort," to meet their child's complex needs; "Providing Care: An Often Overwhelming Responsibility," due to the intensive organization and provision of intensive, on-going physical and psychosocial care; "Effects of Care on Caregiving Parents: `Confined to a Helpless Situation,'" from which neither they nor their children could escape and over which they had little control; and "Caregiver Coping: Celebrating the Child While Mourning the Losses. " Mothers who participated in this study deeply loved and admired their children and found joy, meaning, and purpose in their experience as their child's primary caregiver despite the many challenges that such caregiving presented,  The theory of ambiguous loss (Boss, 2006, 2010) provides insight into a unique kind of loss that reflects a response to someone who is physically present but psychologically absent as exemplified by children with catastrophic epilepsy who were described by their parents in this study. The parental experience that may have reflected ambiguous loss in this study <b>complicates</b> both <b>grief</b> and relationships and prevents closure in response to the loss. Participants in this study, however, engaged in behaviors that were consistent to varying degrees with guidelines proposed by Boss that contributed to their ability to cope with the ambiguous loss they may experience.   Children with catastrophic epilepsy present with complex health issues that are challenging and sometimes life-threatening. Caregivers are challenged by an overloaded healthcare system where busy health care providers care for typically developing children as well as those with special needs. Parents of children with catastrophic epilepsy face particular challenges in addressing their children's health-related needs due, in part, to the frequency with which they require provider assistance, including informed responses to their questions and concerns about their child. Research is warranted to investigate health care provision alternatives such as palliative care that would involve parents as respected partners in health care planning and decision-making.   M.

40|$|This paper delves {{into the}} realms of tragedy, memory and representation. Drawing upon the {{phenomenon}} of the Phantom Limb and extending it towards a theory of Phantom Bodies, various artworks - literary, theatrical and visual - are examined. After the conflagration of the terrorist attack, how are these absences grieved over and remembered through artistic representation? The essay examines this question by positioning itself amongst the scarred landscapes of post-September 11 New York and suicide bombings in Israel (2000 - 2006). Furthermore, it investigates whether humanity can be restored in the aftermath of an event in which certain individuals have sought to eradicate it. The fragmentation of the affected body in these scenarios is understood as further <b>complicating</b> processes of <b>grief</b> and remembrance. Artists who reject political polemic and engage with the dimensions of human loss are seen to have discovered means of referring to the absence caused by the act of terrorism. Three such recurring representations present themselves: ash and remnants, presence/absence and memory building. Phantom Bodies are perceived as simultaneously functioning as a reminder of the event itself, insisting upon the response of bearing witness, and {{as a symbol of the}} overwhelming power of humanity. Challenges arise when individuals or sections of the affected society deem these artworks to be inappropriate or explicit. Works considered include: Neil LaBute&# 039;s play The Mercy Seat, Sigalit Landau&# 039;s art installation The Country, Jonathan Safran Foer&# 039;s Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close, Spike Lee&# 039;s 25 th Hour, Daniel Libeskind&# 039;s architectural plans for the World Trade Center site, Eric Fischl&# 039;s sculpture &# 039;Tumbling Woman&# 039;, Honor Molloy&# 039;s autodelete://beginning dump of physical memory and A. B. Yehoshua&# 039;s A Woman in Jerusalem. The accompanying play, Tales of Ash: A diptych for the theatre, is set in Melbourne, New York and Tel Aviv and deals with life in the face of and after terror. It veers between naturalism, poetic monologue and the epic. Tales of Ash contains two plays. The first centres on Mia, a young sculptor living in New York, who loses both her lover and her creativity on September 11. Upon returning to her home in Melbourne, she finds familial bonds still entwined with guilt and family trauma. The second play revolves around Ilana and Benny, two people living in Tel Aviv, who find themselves suddenly thrust together after a devastating bombing. As they attempt to resume rhythms of life, in the face of all the inherent ferocity of a modern existence in Israel, the struggle between The Ash Woman and The Ash Takers escalates...|$|R
