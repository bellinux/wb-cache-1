5|$|The {{windows of}} Kirkpatrick chapel {{underwent}} an eleven-year restoration beginning in 2004 with the chapel's <b>clerestory</b> windows {{under the direction}} of Michael Padovan and his studio Jersey Art Stained Glass in Frenchtown, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} <b>clerestory</b> {{was added to}} the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these {{reconstruction}} works necessitated the repositioning of the door on the south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, with a great window and door also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the <b>clerestory,</b> but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a human figure, and a shield with fragments of coloured glass, possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in the porch led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. The porch also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings unaltered.|$|E
5|$|St Peter's {{is made up}} {{of three}} parts, {{including}} a mid-19th-century west tower, which replaced the original in 1859–60 after it fell down. The perpendicular <b>clerestory</b> is decorated with shields in quatrefoils and is lit with closely set three-light windows. The tall decorated chancel has very large windows. The side windows have reticulated tracery. The large east window was partly rebuilt in 1875–76, and is composed of six lights with two large mouchettes nodding to each other, as well as a very large reticulation unit.|$|E
50|$|Consider {{the use of}} <b>clerestories</b> or vented skylights.|$|R

50|$|In the Minoan palaces of Crete such as Knossos, by contrast, lightwells were {{employed}} in addition to <b>clerestories.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{cruciform}} abbey {{is built}} of Bath stone, {{which gives the}} exterior its yellow colour. It is an atypical example of the Perpendicular form of Gothic architecture, with low aisles and nave arcades and a tall <b>clerestory.</b> The walls and roofs are supported by buttresses and surmounted by battlements, pinnacles and pierced parapets, {{many of which were}} added by George Manners during his 1830's restorations.|$|E
5|$|Arcades of {{semi-circular}} arches {{divide the}} nave from the aisles. On {{the south side}} of the cathedral, a large chapel, built in 1911, extends three bays parallel to the aisle. This chapel provides a more intimate place of worship than the main church or its aisles. The nave has a cross vaulted ceiling with <b>clerestory</b> windows above the arcades. The cathedral's main neoclassical altar of translucent alabaster is a modern replacement for the original wooden gothic altar, now located in the southern side chapel. The main altar, built in Burgos, Spain, was donated by the local Ferre family. Except for the side chapel where terrazzo is used, the cathedral's floor is of gray and white marble design.|$|E
5|$|From about 1493 until 1525 the {{architect}} {{appears to have}} been Seth Derwall, succeeded by George Derwall until 1537. Seth Derwall completed the south transept to a Perpendicular Gothic design, as seen in the transomed windows of the <b>clerestory.</b> He also built the central tower, southwest porch and cloisters. Work commenced on the south west tower in 1508, but it had not risen above the roofline {{at the time of the}} dissolution of the monasteries, and has never been completed. The central tower, rising to , is a “lantern tower” with large windows letting light into the crossing. Its external appearance has been altered by the addition of four battlemented turrets by George Gilbert Scott in the 19thcentury.|$|E
5000|$|The church {{dates from}} the early 13th century, with 14th century transepts and 15th century <b>clerestories</b> and {{crossing}} tower.|$|R
50|$|<b>Clerestories</b> {{were also}} used in early {{double-decker}} buses, giving better ventilation and headroom in the centre corridor, as well as better illumination.|$|R
50|$|Inside, Khomeini's {{sarcophagus}} is centrally {{placed under}} the gilded dome. The dome sits above a transition zone with two layers of <b>clerestories,</b> decorated with stained glass depicting tulips (an Iranian symbol of martyrdom). The dome is supported by eight large marble columns that circle the sarcophagus, that together with other smaller columns support the space frame ceiling. The ceiling is also punctuated by <b>clerestories.</b> The floor and wall surfaces are made of polished white marble. The floor is covered with fine carpets.|$|R
5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both <b>clerestory</b> and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in the choir of York.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that a church was present on the site in the Saxon era, although the earliest fabric in the church is Norman. The present ground plan {{was established in the}} 13th and 14thcenturies, from which time the church's external appearance dates, apart from a major rebuilding in the later part of the 15thcentury, when the range of high windows or <b>clerestory</b> was added. All styles of English Gothic architecture, are represented in the church: Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular. During the civil war, a group of Roundheads stabled their horses in the church. In the 19thcentury the interior of the church was restored by George Gilbert Scott; some wall paintings were revealed, and stained glass was added.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of Chester Cathedral gives {{a warm and}} mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone. The proportions appear spacious because {{the view from the}} west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave, although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England's cathedrals. The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced, those of the nave carrying only the <b>clerestory</b> of large windows with no triforium gallery. The proportions are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.|$|E
50|$|The church {{dates from}} the early 13th century, with 14th century transepts and 15th century <b>clerestories</b> and {{crossing}} tower. The church was heavily restored by Benjamin Ferrey between 1874 and 1875.|$|R
5000|$|The {{church has}} a chancel, chancel arch, nave with aisles {{on the north}} and south sides, vestry at the {{northeast}} corner, baptistery, buttressed narthex (entered from the nave through arches in the buttresses, beneath an overall arch and tympanum) and <b>clerestories</b> above the aisles. Both the aisles and the <b>clerestories</b> have five pairs of lancet windows. [...] Interior features include a sedilia, organ chamber, choir stalls, chancel screen, ornate multi-sided pulpit with green marble work, stone reredos designed as a triptych and depicting the Ascension of Jesus, and a marble font depicting an angel kneeling with a shell.|$|R
50|$|Christ Church, Gore Road, South Hackney (1871). A brick {{building}} with stone dressings in the Decorated Gothic style, seating 850; apsidal chancel, aisled nave with <b>clerestories.</b> Demolished following bomb damage during the Second World War.|$|R
5|$|The {{stained glass}} windows of the nave's north and south aisles {{represent}} one aspect of this synthesis. The north windows depict Biblical figures and scenes, while the south windows contain images associated with human knowledge. The lower of these, at the triforium level, depict the teachings of Christ, while the six upper windows at the <b>clerestory</b> level depict influential figures in Philosophy, Theology, Chivalry, Poetry, Law, and Science, as read from east to west. The Science window faces a window due to Willet on the north wall with scenes from Genesis, symbolizing harmony between the Christian story of the Creation and the modern means of understanding it.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} {{in three stages}} and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west side, is a doorway in Romanesque style, {{on the north side}} is an ogee-headed lancet window. On the left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light window on the west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are lancet windows. The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle. The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a lancet window. To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the <b>clerestory.</b> The <b>clerestory</b> has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular window. At the east end are three windows. The central window, {{at the end of the}} chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E
5|$|With two exceptions, the naves {{and eastern}} {{arms of the}} cathedrals have single lower aisles on either side with a <b>clerestory</b> that {{illuminates}} the central space. At Bristol the aisles are {{at the same height}} as the medieval choir like some German cathedrals, and at Chichester there are two aisles {{on either side of the}} nave like some French cathedrals. At a number of the cathedrals where the transepts are large they also have aisles, either on the eastern side as at Peterborough, Durham, Lincoln and Salisbury or both, as at Winchester, Wells, Ely and York.|$|E
50|$|The column capitals and label stops {{throughout}} the church {{were designed by}} a S. Tinkler of Derby and show naturalistic foliage, fruit, and animals {{with those in the}} nave representing the twelve months of the year. All the windows have early decorated style tracery, with ballflower ornamentation in the chancel. The nave and transept <b>clerestories</b> have triple lancets, while the <b>clerestories</b> in the chancel have carved spherical triangles. The nave roof has traceried spandrels and principals supported on clustered wall shafts. There are six windows (one in the south aisle and five in the narthex) designed in an Arts and Crafts style by Archibald John Davies of the Bromsgrove Guild. They date from 1919-34.|$|R
50|$|Christ Church, Rendlesham Road, Clapton (1871). A brick {{building}} with stone dressings in the Decorated Gothic style, seating around 700; chancel, {{north and south}} chapels, aisled nave with <b>clerestories,</b> bellcote; interior of variegated brickwork. Demolished following bomb damage during the Second World War.|$|R
50|$|It was {{designed}} by architect William C. E. Becker and built in 1936 by the Robert Paulus Construction Company. It consists of five stepped, composition-covered wood roofs with <b>clerestories,</b> rather than a regular glass roof, {{in order to prevent}} damage from frequent hailstorms.|$|R
5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebuilding}} and remodelling {{occurred in the}} late Middle Ages. A chantry chapel, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was founded in 1271 by the merchants Thomas Blount and John de Bucham, who endowed it with lands around Old and New Sleaford, and several surrounding villages. The chapel {{is located on the}} north aisle, and the chaplain was instructed to pray there for the founders at his daily mass. The chantry priest's house is recorded in the 1440s as one of the oldest buildings in Sleaford; located in the churchyard, it became the Vicarage. The tower was probably accompanied by a nave of a similar date, which was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style in the mid to late 14th century; the transept followed twenty or thirty years later, according to Trollope. A <b>clerestory</b> was added in around 1430 and the chancel was remodelled at this time.|$|E
5|$|After his cathedral {{church was}} burned down in 1114, Luffa managed to secure King Henry I's {{financial}} help in rebuilding the church. Besides the rebuilding, Luffa built a Lady chapel, which still remains. Other work still extant {{in the cathedral}} are the arcades, the exteriors of the <b>clerestory</b> and those galleries that are unvaulted. The art historian George Zarnecki {{has argued that the}} rood screen in the cathedral also dates from Luffa's episcopate. Two panels from this work still survive, and depict the meeting of Jesus with Mary and Martha at Bethany as well as the miracle where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. The scenes show some resemblance to works in Hildesheim and Cologne, and this resemblance may mean that Luffa was from Germany, or hired sculptors from there.|$|E
5|$|As other {{stations}} Holden designed, Acton Town station {{features a}} tall block-like ticket hall rising above a low horizontal structure housing the station offices and shops. The ticket hall has a projecting London Underground roundel sign over a canopy, the brick {{walls of the}} ticket hall are punctuated with panels of <b>clerestory</b> windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof. From the ticket hall enclosed stairs descend to the platforms under integral concrete canopies on paired piers in alternating broad and narrow bay formation. A part of the narrow bays is infilled by kiosks, integral poster boards, roundel signs and fixed seating. The platforms are linked by a secondary bridge at the southern end. Reinforced concrete platform canopies replaced the original timber canopies. Since 17 May 1994, the station has been a Grade II Listed building.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Nave, east towards chancel; aisles {{either side}} {{enclosed}} by arcades of four bays supporting the <b>clerestory's</b> and the wooden rafters of the roof. The north (left) octagonal columns are 14th century; the south round columns were added during the 1876 restoration ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Clerestories</b> - in {{passive solar}} {{strategies}} - should be properly located (typically in the sunny {{side of the}} building) and protected from the summer’s sun by rooflines, overhangs, recessed thick walls or other architectural elements, {{in order to prevent}} overheating during the cooling season.|$|R
50|$|To ensure {{daylight}} {{reaches the}} levels below ground, the podium is punctuated with triple-laminated glass. In addition, the 20-meter-tall light tower, which is directly above the Law Library's main reading room, reflects natural daylight through skylights and <b>clerestories,</b> and also draws out stale air.|$|R
5|$|Centralized {{buildings}} of circular or octagonal plan also became used for baptistries and reliquaries {{due to the}} suitability of those shapes for assembly around a single object. Baptisteries began {{to be built in}} the manner of domed mausolea during the 4th century in Italy. The octagonal Lateran Baptistery or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been the first, and the style spread during the 5th century. The Church of the Holy Apostles, or Apostoleion, probably planned by Constantine but built by his successor Constantius in the new capital city of Constantinople, combined the congregational basilica with the centralized shrine. With a similar plan to that of the Church of Saint Simeon Stylites, four naves projected from a central rotunda containing Constantine's tomb and spaces for the tombs of the twelve Apostles. Above the center may have been a <b>clerestory</b> with a wooden dome roofed with bronze sheeting and gold accents.|$|E
5|$|Chester Cathedral has an east-west axis, {{common to}} many cathedrals, with the chancel {{at the eastern}} end, and the façade to the west. The plan is cruciform, with a central tower (as is usual in English monastic churches), but is asymmetrical, having a small {{transept}} {{on the north side}} remaining from an earlier building, and an unusually large south transept. As the plan shows, the asymmetry extends to the west front, where the north tower remains from the Norman building, and the south tower is of the early 16thcentury. At the eastern end, the symmetrical arrangement of the aisles was lost when the end of the south aisle was demolished and rebuilt in an apsidal shape. The nave, choir and south transept have wide aisles on either side, and are lit by <b>clerestory</b> windows and large multi-light windows {{in each of the three}} cliff-like ends. To the north of the cathedral are monastic buildings, including the cloister, refectory and a rectangular chapter house. The façade of the building is abutted on the north by later buildings.|$|E
5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles in the choir screen behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above her is an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – hangs on a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the <b>clerestory</b> overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases {{can be seen in the}} arched gallery, while the choral balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E
50|$|The Ranck Round Barn is 70 feet in {{diameter}} at its base and stands 70 feet tall. The barn features two rows of <b>clerestories</b> set between round lantern conical roofs which decrease in size with height. The building's west entrance has a pavilion with a gambrel roof.|$|R
50|$|The current {{building}} {{was designed by}} Scott Ellinwood and incorporates an energy efficient lighting system that makes use of natural light {{as much as possible}} (<b>clerestories</b> and windows glazed with high-transmittance, heat absorbing glass allow daylight to be used for interior illumination during the day; sensors switch on electric light as daylight fades).|$|R
50|$|To that end, <b>clerestories</b> {{are used}} in {{conjunction}} with stone, brick, concrete and other high mass walls and floors, properly positioned to store solar heat gains during the hotter parts of the day - allowing the walls and the floor to act as a heat bank during the cooler parts of the day.|$|R
