40|$|Background and aim Pain {{is common}} and {{adds to the}} global burden of disease. However, {{individuals}} suffering from pain are a heterogeneous group in terms of pain spreading, intensity and duration. While pain influences overall health care consultation not everyone with pain <b>consult</b> <b>health</b> care. To {{be able to provide}} health care matching the patients’ needs increased knowledge about what factors determines the decision to <b>consult</b> <b>health</b> care is essential. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the combined importance of pain spreading, intensity, duration and pain catastrophizing for <b>consulting</b> <b>health</b> care. Methods In this cross-sectional study we used population based survey data from southeast Sweden (SWEPAIN) including 7792 individuals’ aged 16 – 85 reporting pain. We used Modified Poisson regressions to analyse factors of importance related to the decision to <b>consult</b> <b>health</b> care. Results High and moderate pain intensity, as compared to low, increases the probability of <b>consulting</b> <b>health</b> care (High PR = 1. 7 [95 % CI 1. 51 – 1. 88], moderate PR = 1. 2 [1. 15 – 1. 41]). Having widespread pain, as compared to localised pain, increased the probability of <b>consulting</b> <b>health</b> (PR = 1. 2 [1. 03 – 1. 36). Pain duration was not associated with increased probability of <b>consulting</b> <b>health</b> care (PR = 1. 0 CI 0. 88 – 1. 07). However an interaction (p = 0. 05) between pain duration and pain catastrophizing beliefs was seen indicating a combined importance of the two when <b>consulting</b> <b>health</b> care. Conclusion Our result suggests that pain intensity, pain spreading and pain catastrophizing independently influence the decision to <b>consult</b> <b>health</b> care while there is an interaction effect between pain duration and pain catastrophizing beliefs where the importance of pain catastrophizing believes differ with pain duration; the importance of pain catastrophizing believes differ with pain duration. Implications Treatment and rehabilitation strategies should incorporate this finding in order to meet the individual's needs focusing on the biopsychosocial model within health care focusing not only on actual pain reliefs but also on for example acceptance and behavioural changes...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: In Brazil dental {{treatment}} occurs mainly through the Unified Health System (SUS), which can direct to various services in its basic <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> Whenever needed, other specialties including Endodontics are recommended to patient at the dental visit. Nevertheless, oral health national inquiries {{indicate that a}} part of Brazilian population has never been attended by a dental surgeon. Objectives: To evaluate the access of patients enrolled in the waiting line to Endodontics specialty in two <b>health</b> <b>units</b> in Curitiba-PR and a Basic <b>health</b> <b>Unit</b> (UBS) and the other strategy’s Family Health (ESF) Material and methods: A qualitative, quantitative, descriptive and explorative study was performed, with data collection from reports. Furthermore, the variation of people enrolled in Endodontics in a particular <b>health</b> <b>unit</b> was observed, while an intervention in the waiting line was performed in a different <b>health</b> <b>unit.</b> Results: From april to July 2008, there was a 95 % reduction in {{the total number of}} enrolled patients in the waiting line for Endodontic treatment in the Basic <b>Health</b> <b>Unit</b> of Pilarzinho, while an 88 % reduction of the same aspect occurred in the Basic <b>Health</b> <b>Unit</b> of São Domingos (Family Health Program), which had suffered intervention in the waiting line.

40|$|Masters of Public Health - see Magister Public HealthBackground: Malaria is {{the leading}} cause of death of Uganda's {{children}} under 5 years of age and the number-one cause of illness in adults in Uganda. The success of malaria treatment strategies is closely linked to the behavior of patients and caretakers of young children. In the case of malaria this includes accessing appropriate treatment for suspected malaria in time. In Bungokho Sub County, in spite of the efforts by district health workers and the Ministry of Health to implement the malaria control, prevention and treatment strategies, pregnant women and caretakers of children under 5 years of age continue to present late for treatment in the <b>health</b> <b>units</b> resulting in possible avoidable death or disability. Aim and objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the factors that lead to late presentation of children and pregnant women with malaria for treatment at <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> This was done by exploring the perceptions of caregivers of children under five years and pregnant women on the community knowledge and understanding of the symptoms and treatment of malaria; and describing perceptions of caregivers and pregnant women on health care provision at the <b>health</b> <b>units</b> and alternative treatment for malaria. Methods :The study was conducted in Bungokho Health sub-district, in Mbale district, Eastern Uganda over a two month period in 2009. It was a descriptive exploratory study using qualitative research methods. Four focus groups were carried out, two with caregivers of children under 5 years and two with pregnant women, with each focus group consisting of eight participants. Two caregivers and two pregnant women were identified from the focus groups for further indepth interviews. Four in-depth interviews were conducted with <b>health</b> <b>unit</b> staff from Bungokho HCVI. Notes were taken and observations made during the focus groups and interviews. The proceedings were audio-taped and recordings used to expand and clarify notes. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze the data and identify recurrent themes from the focus group discussions and  interviews of the reasons for late presentation for malaria treatment. Results: All caregivers were women, a significant majority of whom were peasants who had not gone beyond the primary education. Caregivers were aware of the general symptoms of malaria but associated more serious or dangerous symptoms with other causes including witchcraft. Pregnant women, on the other hand, seemed to have sound knowledge of both the general and dangerous symptoms of malaria and were likely to attend the <b>health</b> <b>units</b> timeously for reatment. Religious beliefs and practices, particularly belief in the healing ability of prayers prevented early reporting of malaria cases to <b>health</b> <b>units</b> leading to late presentation. Alternative treatment of malaria from traditional herbalists was also sought by the communities particularly when the intensity of malaria was at its peak during the rainy season. Poverty in the community seemed to play a big role in shaping community preference for treatment sources, as well as early presentation to the <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> It was found that the anticipated cost of laboratory tests and sundries at the <b>health</b> <b>units</b> deterred caregivers from taking children under five to <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> There was therefore a strong reliance (and preference for) community medicine distributor's (CMDs) because of free services and easy access. Lack of support from spouses (in particular husbands) coupled with the rude behavior of health workers towards caregivers and pregnant women discouraged visits to <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> The long waiting time and intermittent drug stock-outs also created a negative perception of service at the <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> Conclusions and recommendations: There is need for further sensitization of communities on the need to seek prompt treatment for children under five years of age at the <b>health</b> <b>units</b> (that is, within 24 hours of the onset of fever). Training and supervision of CMDs should be strengthened to ensure consistent supply of drugs, correct dosage of anti-malarial medication and improvements in the referrals to the <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> In order to improve service delivery at the <b>health</b> <b>units,</b> there is need to review and strengthen human resource management of the <b>health</b> <b>units,</b> including staffing requirements and management practices, such as support and supervision, patient care standards and client feedback mechanisms. It is also important that there are adequate stocks of anti-malarial drugs  and laboratory supplies at <b>health</b> <b>units.</b> South Afric...|$|R
