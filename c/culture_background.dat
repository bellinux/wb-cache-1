[...] True to his roots of social constructionism and post-modernism Bakhtin “was critical of efforts to reduce the unfinalizable, open, and multivocal process of meaning-making in determinate, closed, totalizing ways." [...] According to Bakhtin, the meaning found in any dialogue is unique to the sender and recipient based upon their personal understanding of the world as influenced by the socio-cultural background. “Bakhtin’s dialogism opens up space for communication scholars to conceive of difference in new ways” meaning they must take the background of a subject into consideration when conducting research into their understanding of any text as “a dialogic perspective argues that difference (of all kinds) is basic to the human experience." [...] Kim argues that “his ideas of art as a vehicle oriented towards interaction with its audience in order to express or communicate any sort of intention is reminiscent of Clifford Geertz’s theories on culture." [...] Culture and communication become inextricably linked to one another as one’s understanding, according to Bakhtin, of a given utterance, text, or message, is contingent upon their <b>culture</b> <b>background</b> and experience.|$|E

50|$|Themes of {{feminism}} in {{women of color}} {{and the use of}} magic, “Obeah,” or seer women are prevalent throughout this novel. Nalo Hopkinson presents strong female characters who take control of their fate to make change in the world. Her novel is a work of feminist science fiction and shows a realistic perception of the struggles women face as single mothers as well as the struggles women with different cultural beliefs face in society. However, it shows their ability to use their <b>culture,</b> <b>background,</b> and experiences as women to overcome obstacles and show the true strength women possess.

5000|$|To put it simply: the {{intellectual}}, in this view, {{can fully}} enjoy junk culture {{because of his}} or her high <b>culture</b> <b>background,</b> but the average reader can never raise to the learned intellectual discourse of which he or she is the object. An example of this form of appropriation is Thomas Roberts's An Aesthetics of Junk Fiction (1990). Though Roberts claims to take a distance from studies of canonical fiction, he justifies his (implicit) decision to impose canonical models on popular fiction as follows: [...] "If people who read Goethe and Alessandro Manzoni and Pushkin with pleasure are also reading detective fiction with pleasure, there is more in the detective story than its critics have recognized, perhaps more than even its writers and readers have recognized", This illustrates a frequent strategy: the legitimation of popular fiction {{on the basis of its}} use of canonized literary fiction, and of the legitimized public's response to it.|$|E

In tourism industry, tourism service providers 2 ̆ 7 act as hosts and tourists act as guests.

40|$|Abstract. Before we do any user {{experience}} design for pervasive computing, {{we need to}} know how {{user experience}}, or a particular experience for example presence, is influenced by certain aspects of pervasive computing, such as different interaction methods, content distribution and the embodiment of digital entities. In a pervasive context, different user groups may also experience differently. We conducted an experiment to test influence of these aspects and the user’s <b>culture</b> <b>background</b> on the presence experience in a distributed interactive movie. The results shows that interaction methods had on influence, while embodiment had mixed effects on presence. The influence of the <b>culture</b> <b>background</b> is clear – Chinese perceived more presence than Dutch in all conditions. The influence of distribution on presence needs to be further investigated, but from the current results we tend to believe that distributed presentations decrease presence. ...|$|E

Results of this research show that, at a certain extent, massage senders’ different <b>culture</b> <b>background</b> could influence on their emotional expressivity level...|$|E
