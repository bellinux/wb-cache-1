Considering the tilting motion of cylinder occurs in experiments, the impedance matrix of cylinder system is obtained first. An equivalent seal force identification model is set up for multiple seals based on double plane balance theory of rotor dynamics. The resultant seal forces are calculated on two end planes of the cylinder, and resolved to multiple sections that seals located. A frequency domain identification method delivers the test seals stiffness and damping coefficients. <b>Compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> tests were run from 1000 rpm- 2200 rpm, 0. 1 - 0. 6 Mpa supply pressures were used. For each ∆P test condition, the static eccentricity ratio ε=e/Cr is range from zero to approximately 0. 6. Results show that 8 rotordynamic coefficients increase almost linearly with inlet/outlet pressure ratio. Increasing eccentricity ratio weakens the stability of seal-rotor system obviously...|$|E

The {{maintenance}} {{management in the}} companies should be involved on the reduction of losses, wastes and breakdowns so that together with other areas, they progress towards a lean manufacturing company as Zollner Electronics Costa Rica Ltd. intends to be. To achieve that, one of the bases is the total productive maintenance (TPM), with which it is sought to increase indices of efficiency, availability and quality. To do this, the project starts with the application of 5 S (an important key for TPM implementation) both in the maintenance department and in the production lines of the SMT area. Subsequently, autonomous maintenance and focused improvements are introduced as initial pillars. For the former, manuals are made and implemented for the most critical machines in the production process. For the focused improvements, signaling {{is placed on the}} <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> gauges to the machines and the cleaning activities have been strengthening for sensors and nozzles which have presented considerable errors in the past. To complement and improve the {{maintenance management}}, it has been made a codification for the equipment, the criticality has been defined and the maintenance work orders have been introduced, while the department's digital information system has been improved. It is sought to measure the improvements and analysis {{of the impact of the}} maintenance on the company, so it is implemented maintenance indexes such as TMEF, TMDR, reliability and availability. For the latter, improvements of 2 % are evident at the end of the project. There is also measured the overall efficiency index for which there is a 21 % increase between January and May 2017. In addition, a strategy of cultural change is designed to give continuity and sustainability to the project within the company. Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica.

50|$|A {{turbojet}} engine is a {{gas turbine engine}} that works by <b>compressing</b> <b>air</b> with an <b>inlet</b> and a compressor (axial, centrifugal, or both), mixing fuel with the <b>compressed</b> <b>air,</b> burning the mixture in the combustor, and then passing the hot, high pressure air through a turbine and a nozzle. The compressor is powered by the turbine, which extracts energy from the expanding gas passing through it.

All the air ingested by the inlet is passed through the compressor, combustor, and turbine, unlike the turbofan engine described below.|$|R

50|$|On larger diesel {{generators}} {{found in}} large shore installations and especially on ships, a pneumatic starting gear is used. The air motor is normally powered by <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> at pressures of 10-30 bar. The air motor {{is made up}} of a center drum {{about the size of a}} soup can with four or more slots cut into it to allow for the vanes to be placed radially on the drum to form chambers around the drum. The drum is offset inside a round casing so that the <b>inlet</b> <b>air</b> for starting is admitted at the area where the drum and vanes form a small chamber compared to the others. The <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> can only expand by rotating the drum, which allows the small chamber to become larger and puts another one of the cambers in the <b>air</b> <b>inlet.</b> The <b>air</b> motor spins much too fast to be used directly on the flywheel of the engine; instead a large gearing reduction, such as a planetary gear, is used to lower the output speed. A Bendix gear is used to engage the flywheel.|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} {{is also used}} for {{combustion}} gas turbine <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> cooling. Instead of shifting electrical demand to the night, this technique shifts generation capacity to the day. To generate ice at night, the turbine is often mechanically connected to a large chiller's compressor. During peak daytime loads, water is circulated between the ice pile and a heat exchanger {{in front of the}} turbine air intake, cooling the intake air to near freezing temperatures. Since the air is colder, the turbine can <b>compress</b> more <b>air</b> with a given amount of compressor power. Typically, both the generated electrical power and turbine efficiency rise when the inlet cooling system is activated. This system is similar to the <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> energy storage system.|$|R
40|$|The LTC coating removal system {{consists}} of several hand {{tools such as}} a Roto Peen scaler and a needlegun. They are designed to remove coatings from steel, concrete, brick, and wood. These are used with the LTC PTC- 6 vacuum system to capture dust and debris as removal of the coating takes place. The PTC- 6 is a vacuum system designed {{to be used with}} surface decontamination equipment. Dust and debris are captured by a high efficiency particulate filter (HEPA) vacuum system that deposits the waste directly into an on-board 23 -gallon waste drum.

50|$|A {{continuous}} flow of <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> is {{provided to the}} helmet and vented to the surrounding water at a pressure {{very close to the}} ambient pressure at the exhaust port, which lets the diver breathe normally. The helmet must have a non-return valve at the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> port of the helmet, to prevent massive and fatal squeeze, should the air line be cut at the surface. Diving helmets, while very heavy, displace a great deal of water and combined with the air in the suit, would make the diver float with his head out of the water. To overcome this, some helmets are weighted on the corselet, while other divers wear weighted belts which have straps that go over the corselet. Some divers have an <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> control valve, while others may have only one control, the exhaust back-pressure. Helmet divers are subject to the same pressure limitations as other divers, such as decompression sickness and nitrogen narcosis.|$|R
50|$|The {{turbojet}} is an airbreathing jet engine, usually used in aircraft. It {{consists of}} a gas turbine with a propelling nozzle.

The <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> from the compressor is heated by the fuel in the combustion chamber and then allowed to expand through the turbine.

5000|$|Variation of {{performance}} {{parameters of the}} motor is achieved by varying the time during which the air is allowed to enter the chamber: A longer <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> period allows more air to flow into the chamber and therefore results in more torque. A shorter inlet period will limit the air supply and allows {{the air in the}} chamber to perform expansion work at a much higher efficiency. In this way <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> (energy) consumption can be exchanged for higher torque and power output depending on the requirements of the application (this is identical to function of the [...] "cutoff" [...] control in a steam engine).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{proposed}} {{experimental work}} intends to analyse the thermal {{performance of a}} TES unit incorporated into a ventilation system under different working conditions. The influences of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature and velocity on the air outlet temperature and heat transfer rate were investigated The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature used for the solidification of RT 25 were 10 °C, 12 °C and 14 °C and for the melting 34 °C, 36 °C and 38 °C. The selected <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocities were {{the same for the}} melting and solidification process: 0. 5 m/s, 1. 4 m/s and 2. 5 m/s. The results suggest that an increase of the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity reduces linearly the temperature difference between the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet for the solidification process of the RT 25. Contrary, for the melting of the RT 25, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity does not reduce the temperature difference linearly, increasing the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature furthermore from 36 °C to 38 °C did not affect the melting time. The <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature plays a significant role on the melting process, reducing linearly the <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet temperature difference and the heat transfer rate, however does not influence the solidification process, similar <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet temperature difference and the heat transfer rate were obtained for all condition. Thus, <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> velocity and <b>air</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature have to be carefully balanced to optimize the whole running cycle of both melting and solidification processes...|$|R

40|$|A new cooling {{approach}} with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> {{has been developed}} in order to cool the cutting tool edge during turning of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy. The cutting forces, chip morphology and chip temperature were measured and compared with those measured during machining with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry cutting conditions. The chip temperature is lower with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling than those with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and dry machining. The combined effects of reduced friction and chip bending away from the cutting zone {{as a result of}} the high-speed air produce a thinner chip with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling and a thicker chip with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> cooling compared to dry machining alone. The marginally higher cutting force associated with the application of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> compared with dry machining is the result of lower chip temperatures and a higher shear plane angle. The tendency to form a segmented chip is higher when machining with cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> than that with <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and dry machining only within the ranges of cutting speed and feed when chip transitions from continuous to the segmented. The effect of cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> on the cutting force and chip formation diminishes with increase in cutting speed and feed rate. The application of both <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> and cryogenic <b>compressed</b> <b>air</b> reduced flank wear and the tendency to form the chip built-up edge.
