Six hypovirus-infected isolates of C. parasitica were sampled from the population, and each hypovirus was transferred into six hypovirus-free recipient isolates. The resulting 36 hypovirus-fungus com-binations were used to estimate genetic variation in tolerance to hypoviruses, in hypovirus virulence, and in virus-fungus interactions.

40|$|Póster presentado en el XVIII Congreso de la Sociedad Española de Fitopatología (SEF), celebrado en Palencia del 20 al 23 de septiembre de 2016. The soilborne {{pathogen}} Verticillium dahliae causes vascular wilts in a {{wide variety}} of crops. Isolates infecting olive can be classified into defoliating (D) or non-defoliating (ND). The spread of the D pathotype have greatly increased the impact of this disease on olive production. Fungal viruses (mycoviruses) from pathogenic species have potential as biocontrol agents as some reduce the virulence of their fungal host. The successful application of micoviruses to the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungi</b> is dependent on their efficient transmission among isolates in natural fungal populations. Mycoviruses are thought to be transmitted horizontally mainly between somatically compatible isolates during hyphal anastomosis. In V. dahliae all D isolates belong to the same VCG while ND isolates conform different VCGs. In our aim to explore the potential of mycovirus to control Verticillium wilt, we have tested 200 isolates of V. dahliae from different areas of the Guadalquivir Valley and sampled in different years, revealing that only three exhibited viral infection. All three isolates harbored the same unclassified mycovirus with similarity to plant viruses of the family Tombusviridae which we designated VdUV 1. Intriguingly, the VdUV 1 -infected isolates did not belong to the same VCG; two were ND and one D. An analysis of VdUV 1 transmission by hyphal anastomosis using hygR-tagged D and ND recipient isolates showed that, as expected, it was readily transmitted among isolates of the same VCG while somatic incompatibility generally acted as a barrier for this transmission. However, we also found that the presence of “bridge” isolates can add complexity to this simple scenario. Thus, the two ND isolates transmitted VdUV 1 only to other compatible ND isolates. By contrast the VdUV 1 -infected D isolate transmitted it to both D and ND isolates, although with clearly different efficiencies, 100...|$|E

Cryptococcus neoformans produces melanin in the presence of certain exogenous substrates such as l- 3, 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine and melanization may protect the fungus against biotic and abiotic environmental factors. In the present study, we investigated the effect of exposure to an UVB irradiance of 1000 mW m(- 2) (biologically effective weighted irradiance) on the survival of melanized and nonmelanized cells of four strains of C. neoformans and four strains of C. laurentii. The relative survival (survival of cells exposed to radiation in relation to cells not exposed) of cells grown 2, 4, 6 or 8 days on medium with or without L-dopa was determined after exposure to UVB doses of 1. 8 and 3. 6 kJ m(- 2). Both the irradiance spectrum and the intensities of those doses are environmentally realistic, and, in fact, occur routinely during summer months in temperate regions. Differences in tolerance to UVB radiation were observed between the C. neoformans and C. laurentii strains. The C. neoformans strains were more susceptible to UVB radiation than the C. laurentii strains. In C. neoformans, differences in tolerance to radiation were observed during development of both melanized and nonmelanized cells. For most treatments (strain, time of growth and UVB dose), there were virtually no differences in tolerances between melanized and nonmelanized cells, but when differences occurred they were smaller than those previously observed with UVC. In tests with two strains of C. laurentii, there was no difference in tolerance to UVB radiation between melanized and nonmelanized cells during 8 days of culture; and in tests with four strains for less culture time (4 days) there were no significant differences in tolerance between melanized and nonmelanized cells of any strain of this species.

There was a higher incidence of A. niger in the lot from the town of Catolé Rocha, Paraíba State, with very low incidence of the fungus in the town Petrolina, Pernambuco State. The treatments with the best results were fungicide and thermotherapy for 20 minutes...|$|E
40|$|Amostras de sementes de plantas nativas de matas, cerrado e de campo empregadas para a confecção de artesanato de várias regiões do Brasil foram avaliadas quanto aos aspectos fitossanitários. Realizou–se o levantamento e identificação de fungos associados às sementes, bem como os sintomas nas mesmas. Técnicas de desinfestações superficiais e de tratamento natural com uma solução de óleos vegetais extraídos de essências florestais foi empregada para o controle dos fungos. As sementes de Euterpe oleraceae, E. precatoria var. precatoria, Dipterix alata, Orbignya phalerata, Phytelephas macrocarpa, Socratea exorrhiza, Hymenaea {{courbaril}} L. var. stilbocarpa, Leucaena leucocephala, Schefflera morototoni, Astrocaryum faranae, Sapindus saponaria, Ipomoea pes-caprae, Caesalpinia peltophoroides, Heliconia metallica, Cyperus rotundus e Astrocaryum aculeatum, apresentaram – se naturalmente infectadas com uma gama significante de fungos. Os fungos mais freqüentes associados às sementes foram Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium sp., Chaetomium sp., Botryodiplodia sp., Epicoccum sp., Eurotium sp., Fusarium sp., Monilia sp., Nigrospora sphaerica, Penicillium sp., Pestalotiopsis sp., Phialophora sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Rhizopus sp., Syncephalastrum sp. e Verticillium sp. Os danos causados por estes fungos foram deformações, manchas necróticas, podridões moles e deterioração parcial ou total das sementes. O tratamento com a solução de óleos foi bastante eficiente para todos os fungos, com a erradicação da maioria deles. _______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTSome seed {{samples of}} native plants from forestry, cerrado and savannas which are currently employed for the confection of handcrafts from several brazilian regions were valued {{as far as}} the phytosanitary aspects are concerned. The fungi overview and identification associated to the seeds as well as their symptoms were accomplished. Techniques of superficial de-infections and natural treatment with appropriate vegetable oil solutions extracted from tree essences were used to the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungi</b> studied in the current work. Seeds of Euterpe oleraceae, E. precatoria var. precatoria, Dipterix alata, Orbignya phalerata, Phytelephas macrocarpa, Socratea exorrhiza, Hymenaea courbaril L. var. stilbocarpa, Leucaena leucocephala, Schefflera morototoni, Astrocaryum faranae, Sapindus saponaria, Ipomoea pes-caprae, Caesalpinia peltophoroides, Heliconia metallica, Cyperus rotundus and Astrocaryum aculeatum, have shown themselves naturally infected with a significant range of fungi. The most frequent fungi associated to the seeds were Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium sp., Chaetomium sp., Botryodiplodia sp., Epicoccum sp., Eurotium sp., Fusarium sp., Monilia sp., Nigrospora sphaerica, Penicillium sp., Pestalotiopsis sp., Phialophora sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Rhizopus sp., Syncephalastrum sp. e Verticillium sp. The damages caused by these fungi have been associated to deformations, necrotic spots and soft rotten as well as partial or total decay of seeds. The treatment we propose here was accomplished with the natural oils solution and {{it has been shown that}} the proposed technique is very efficient in the control of all the fungi for the complete eradication of them...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} limitations of cocoa production worldwide is primarily diseases caused by the pathogenic <b>fungi</b> <b>of</b> the genus Moniliophthora sp., especially, Moniliophthora roreri and Moniliophthora perniciosa, causing moniliasis and the witches' broom disease, respectively; both diseases are highly invasive and endemic in cocoa. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe the control strategies that can be used to handle the moniliasis and witches' broom diseases. This study was conducted in accor-dance with the Prisma (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement, for which a systematic literature search in the ScienceDirect, Springer Link and Scopus databases was used. Original investigation articles over the last 12 years were included, inclusion and exclusion criteria were also applied. In countries like Brazil and Costa Rica, the year with most reports of related articles was 2008. The most used strategies for the disease control are the phytosanitation, the copper-based fungicides and biologic agents <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungus</b> and bacteria, specially, Trichoderma sp. and Bacillus sp.
