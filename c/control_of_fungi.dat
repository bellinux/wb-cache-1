We studied variation in tolerance to hypoviruses in fungal hosts and variation in virulence among virus isolates from a local population in Italy. Tolerance is defined as the relative fitness of a fungal individual when infected with hypoviruses (compared to being uninfected); virulence is defined for each hypovirus as the reduction in fitness of fungal hosts relative to virus-free hosts. Six hypovirus-infected isolates of C. parasitica were sampled from the population, and each hypovirus was transferred into six hypovirus-free recipient isolates. The resulting 36 hypovirus-fungus com-binations were used to estimate genetic variation in tolerance to hypoviruses, in hypovirus virulence, and in virus-fungus interactions. Four phenotypes were evaluated for each virus-fungus combination to estimate relative fitness: (i) sporulation, i. e., the number of asexual spores (conidia) produced; (ii) canker area on field-inoculated chestnut trees, (iii) vertical transmission of hypoviruses into conidia, and (iv) conidial ger-mination.

Thus, B. capitata seeds were immersed in four doses of the bactericide kasugamycin (0, 1. 5, 3. 0 and 4. 5 mL/L) and/or in four concentrations of the fungicide carbendazim+ thiram (0, 2. 92, 5. 84 e 8. 75 mL/Kg), totaling 16 treatments. After the treatments, the operculum was removed from the seeds, which were placed on trays containing autoclaved sand, covered with transparent plastic film and kept in the nursery. In the germination test, treatments were distributed in randomized block design, factorial arrangement of 4 x 4 (bactericidal doses x fungicide doses), with four replicates of 50 seeds per plot. For the test of seed health quality, the Blotter test was employed in completely randomized design, using 20 replicates and 10 seeds. Health quality and germination were evaluated at 15 and 40 days after the treatment of seeds, respectively.

The soilborne {{pathogen}} Verticillium dahliae causes vascular wilts in a {{wide variety}} of crops. Isolates infecting olive can be classified into defoliating (D) or non-defoliating (ND). The spread of the D pathotype have greatly increased the impact of this disease on olive production. Fungal viruses (mycoviruses) from pathogenic species have potential as biocontrol agents as some reduce the virulence of their fungal host. The successful application of micoviruses to the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungi</b> is dependent on their efficient transmission among isolates in natural fungal populations. Mycoviruses are thought to be transmitted horizontally mainly between somatically compatible isolates during hyphal anastomosis. In V. dahliae all D isolates belong to the same VCG while ND isolates conform different VCGs. In our aim to explore the potential of mycovirus to control Verticillium wilt, we have tested 200 isolates of V. dahliae from different areas of the Guadalquivir Valley and sampled in different years, revealing that only three exhibited viral infection. All three isolates harbored the same unclassified mycovirus with similarity to plant viruses of the family Tombusviridae which we designated VdUV 1. Intriguingly, the VdUV 1 -infected isolates did not belong to the same VCG; two were ND and one D. An analysis of VdUV 1 transmission by hyphal anastomosis using hygR-tagged D and ND recipient isolates showed that, as expected, it was readily transmitted among isolates of the same VCG while somatic incompatibility generally acted as a barrier for this transmission. However, we also found that the presence of âbridgeâ isolates can add complexity to this simple scenario. Thus, the two ND isolates transmitted VdUV 1 only to other compatible ND isolates. By contrast the VdUV 1 -infected D isolate transmitted it to both D and ND isolates, although with clearly different efficiencies, 100...|$|E

Cryptococcus neoformans produces melanin in the presence of certain exogenous substrates such as l- 3, 4 dihydroxyphenylalanine and melanization may protect the fungus against biotic and abiotic environmental factors. In the present study, we investigated the effect of exposure to an UVB irradiance of 1000 mW m(- 2) (biologically effective weighted irradiance) on the survival of melanized and nonmelanized cells of four strains of C. neoformans and four strains of C. laurentii. The relative survival (survival of cells exposed to radiation in relation to cells not exposed) of cells grown 2, 4, 6 or 8 days on medium with or without L-dopa was determined after exposure to UVB doses of 1. 8 and 3. 6 kJ m(- 2). Both the irradiance spectrum and the intensities of those doses are environmentally realistic, and, in fact, occur routinely during summer months in temperate regions. Differences in tolerance to UVB radiation were observed between the C. neoformans and C. laurentii strains. The C. neoformans strains were more susceptible to UVB radiation than the C. laurentii strains. In C. neoformans, differences in tolerance to radiation were observed during development of both melanized and nonmelanized cells. For most treatments (strain, time of growth and UVB dose), there were virtually no differences in tolerances between melanized and nonmelanized cells, but when differences occurred they were smaller than those previously observed with UVC. In tests with two strains of C. laurentii, there was no difference in tolerance to UVB radiation between melanized and nonmelanized cells during 8 days of culture; and in tests with four strains for less culture time (4 days) there were no significant differences in tolerance between melanized and nonmelanized cells of any strain of this species.

The thermal treatment was used by immersion in water heated to 60 degrees for 5, 10 and 20 minutes. The chemical treatment was done with Captan fungicide. The study used 100 seeds per treatment (10 seeds per petri dish), which were incubated for seven days, at a temperature of 22 Â± 2 Â°C and 12 -hour photoperiod. The qualitative and quantitative assessment (expressed in percentage) of the fungi associated with the seeds was done with the help of a stereoscope. In the examined samples, only the Aspergillus niger fungus was found. There was a higher incidence of A. niger in the lot from the town of CatolÃ© Rocha, ParaÃ­ba State, with very low incidence of the fungus in the town Petrolina, Pernambuco State. The treatments with the best results were fungicide and thermotherapy for 20 minutes...|$|E

Realizouâse o levantamento e identificaÃ§Ã£o de fungos associados Ã s sementes, bem como os sintomas nas mesmas. TÃ©cnicas de desinfestaÃ§Ãµes superficiais e de tratamento natural com uma soluÃ§Ã£o de Ã³leos vegetais extraÃ­dos de essÃªncias florestais foi empregada para o controle dos fungos. As sementes de Euterpe oleraceae, E. precatoria var. precatoria, Dipterix alata, Orbignya phalerata, Phytelephas macrocarpa, Socratea exorrhiza, Hymenaea {{courbaril}} L. var. stilbocarpa, Leucaena leucocephala, Schefflera morototoni, Astrocaryum faranae, Sapindus saponaria, Ipomoea pes-caprae, Caesalpinia peltophoroides, Heliconia metallica, Cyperus rotundus e Astrocaryum aculeatum, apresentaram â se naturalmente infectadas com uma gama significante de fungos. Os fungos mais freqÃ¼entes associados Ã s sementes foram Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium sp., Chaetomium sp., Botryodiplodia sp., Epicoccum sp., Eurotium sp., Fusarium sp., Monilia sp., Nigrospora sphaerica, Penicillium sp., Pestalotiopsis sp., Phialophora sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Rhizopus sp., Syncephalastrum sp. e Verticillium sp. Os danos causados por estes fungos foram deformaÃ§Ãµes, manchas necrÃ³ticas, podridÃµes moles e deterioraÃ§Ã£o parcial ou total das sementes. O tratamento com a soluÃ§Ã£o de Ã³leos foi bastante eficiente para todos os fungos, com a erradicaÃ§Ã£o da maioria deles. _______________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTSome seed {{samples of}} native plants from forestry, cerrado and savannas which are currently employed for the confection of handcrafts from several brazilian regions were valued {{as far as}} the phytosanitary aspects are concerned. The fungi overview and identification associated to the seeds as well as their symptoms were accomplished. Techniques of superficial de-infections and natural treatment with appropriate vegetable oil solutions extracted from tree essences were used to the <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>fungi</b> studied in the current work. Seeds of Euterpe oleraceae, E. precatoria var. precatoria, Dipterix alata, Orbignya phalerata, Phytelephas macrocarpa, Socratea exorrhiza, Hymenaea courbaril L. var. stilbocarpa, Leucaena leucocephala, Schefflera morototoni, Astrocaryum faranae, Sapindus saponaria, Ipomoea pes-caprae, Caesalpinia peltophoroides, Heliconia metallica, Cyperus rotundus and Astrocaryum aculeatum, have shown themselves naturally infected with a significant range of fungi. The most frequent fungi associated to the seeds were Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium sp., Chaetomium sp., Botryodiplodia sp., Epicoccum sp., Eurotium sp., Fusarium sp., Monilia sp., Nigrospora sphaerica, Penicillium sp., Pestalotiopsis sp., Phialophora sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Rhizopus sp., Syncephalastrum sp. e Verticillium sp. The damages caused by these fungi have been associated to deformations, necrotic spots and soft rotten as well as partial or total decay of seeds. The treatment we propose here was accomplished with the natural oils solution and {{it has been shown that}} the proposed technique is very efficient in the control of all the fungi for the complete eradication of them...|$|E
