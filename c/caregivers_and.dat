5|$|Implementing {{the diet}} can present {{difficulties}} for <b>caregivers</b> <b>and</b> the patient {{due to the}} time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet (MAD) or the low-glycaemic index treatment (LGIT) diet, because they find the difficulties too great.|$|E

5|$|According to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), {{children}} who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD {{may also be}} found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary <b>caregivers</b> <b>and</b> history (as available) of the child’s patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child’s behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child’s early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} and {{moderate}} stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase patient safety and reduce caretaker burden. Examples of such modifications are the adherence to simplified routines, the placing of safety locks, the labelling of household items to cue {{the person with the}} disease or the use of modified daily life objects. If eating becomes problematic, food will need to be prepared in smaller pieces or even pureed. When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the <b>caregivers</b> <b>and</b> family members. The use of physical restraints is rarely indicated in any stage of the disease, although there are situations when they are necessary to prevent harm to the person with AD or their caregivers.|$|E
5|$|Family members {{contribute}} to pragmatic development in different ways. Fathers often act as secondary <b>caregivers,</b> <b>and</b> may know the child less intimately. Older siblings may lack {{the capacity to}} acknowledge the child's needs. As a result, both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly. They often challenge children to improve their communication skills, therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics. Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants, and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants. Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants, which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings. There are limitations to studies {{that focus on the}} influences of fathers and siblings, as most research is descriptive and correlational. In reality, there are many variations of family configurations, and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does. The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother/child pairs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{relationship}} between health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) in people with Parkinson’s disease <b>and</b> their <b>caregivers</b> is little understood and any effects on caregiver strain remain unclear. This paper examines these relationships in an Australian sample. Methods Using the generic EuroQol (EQ- 5 D) and disease-specific Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire- 39 Item (PDQ- 39), HRQoL was evaluated {{in a sample of}} 97 people with PD <b>and</b> their <b>caregivers.</b> Caregiver strain was assessed using the Modified Caregiver Strain Index. Associations were evaluated between: (i) <b>caregiver</b> <b>and</b> care-recipient HRQoL; (ii) <b>caregiver</b> HRQoL <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> strain, and; (iii) between <b>caregiver</b> strain <b>and</b> care-recipient HRQoL. Results No statistically significant relationships were found between <b>caregiver</b> <b>and</b> care-recipient HRQoL, or between <b>caregiver</b> HRQoL <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> strain. Although this Australian sample of caregivers experienced relatively good HRQoL and moderately low strain, a significant correlation was found between HRQoL of people with PD <b>and</b> <b>caregiver</b> strain (rho 0. 43, p [*] Conclusion Poor HRQoL in people with PD is associated with higher strain in caregivers. Therapy interventions may target problems reported as most troublesome by people with PD, with potential to reduce strain on the caregiver. </p...|$|R

5|$|The emergentist {{coalition}} model {{suggests that}} children {{make use of}} multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object. The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues {{are available from the}} start of word learning, it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process. While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze of <b>caregivers</b> <b>and</b> use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping. Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use {{of a wide range of}} cues develops over time.|$|E

40|$|Objective To use receiver-operating {{characteristics}} {{analysis to}} identify multilevel diagnostic likelihood ratios {{and provide a}} framework for the diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children (5 – 10 years old) and adolescents (11 – 18 years old) in an outpatient setting. Method <b>Caregiver,</b> teacher, <b>and</b> youth reports from the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA) were obtained for 299 children and 321 adolescents with multiple imputation of missing data. The reference standard was diagnosis of ADHD based on case history and a semistructured diagnostic interview masked to the ASEBA measurements. Results In children, caregiver-reported Attention Problems (area under the curve [AUC] = 0. 74) outperformed all other subscales of the <b>caregiver</b> <b>and</b> teacher measures (AUCs ≤ 0. 72). In the older sample, caregiver- and teacher-reported Attention Problems (caregiver AUC = 0. 73; teacher AUC = 0. 61) were best at identifying ADHD. Inclusion of <b>caregiver</b> <b>and</b> teacher reports significantly (p <. 001 for all comparisons) increased prediction of ADHD diagnosis, whereas youth self-report did not. Conclusion Caregiver-reported Attention Problems were more useful than teacher-reports and self-report in identifying ADHD.
