40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{images of}} the everyday reality in T. C. Boyle's collection After the Plague as symbols of postmodern era. I argue that references and allusions to numerous everyday objects provided in Boyle's stories become symbols of the reality. Although the author doesn’t directly depict the settings of his stories, he recounts objects that are distinctly denotative of a certain place (for example, in Friendly Skies Boyle describes the airplane through the images of paperback books, bagels and espresso <b>cups,</b> <b>boarding</b> passes etc.) or action (like the imagery of grocery shopping in the story After the Plague). These objects are often autonomous {{from each other and}} deprived of the direct references to their use. Through the plurality of these images Boyle defines the boundaries of his characters’ existence and creates a postmodern setting, where illusion of reality is often more real than reality itself. The author not only suggests fragmentation of cultural and social spaces, but also gives an example of postmodern reality as a construct of images...|$|R

Plasma {{flow in the}} vicinity of Jupiter was monitored by the four modulated-grid Faraday <b>cups</b> on <b>board</b> each of the Voyager spacecraft at times of closest Jupiter approach. Sensor measurements reveal the flow of magnetospheric plasma to be directed away from the equatorial current sheet near local noon and to be directed towards the sheet in the dusk to midnight sector. The observed flow patterns are interpreted in terms of short-time-scale perturbations of magnetic flux tubes due to the compression of the dayside magnetosphere by the solar wind. It is noted that such a dynamic motion is quite different from what would be expected of slower, quasi-static equilibrium plasma sheet expansion and contraction...|$|R
