50|$|In 1982 Hellyar had an {{exhibition}} called Shelter at the Auckland City Art Gallery. For this she {{filled the room}} entirely with structures created from muslin, flax and twigs, which were plaited, woven and stitched together. The structures resembled traps, lairs or shelters, and were 'inhabited' by 'small creatures made from substances like fur and <b>claws,</b> <b>shells</b> and bark'.|$|R

50|$|Itako {{also carry}} a black cylinder, often bamboo, {{containing}} another protective charm and their certificate of itako training. The cylinders {{are said to}} be used to trap the spirits of animals that attempt to possess a human being. Finally, the women carry beaded necklaces (irataka nenju), which are used in ceremonies and made up of beads and animal bones. The bones are typically jaw bones of deer or foxes, but have also included bear teeth, eagle <b>claws,</b> or <b>shells.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Shell {{rings in}} the United States may form a {{complete}} ring, or be open, C-shaped, or U- or horseshoe-shaped. They may form a nearly perfect circle, or an oval. In almost all cases, the central area or [...] "plaza" [...] contains {{little or no}} shell or occupational debris. Most shell rings in the United States consist primarily of oyster shells, but may include periwinkles, razor clams, whelks, ribbed mussels, hard-shelled clams (quahogs), and blue and stone crab <b>claws</b> and <b>shell</b> bits. The Common orient clam {{is the most common}} component in shell mounds in Japan. Other shells found in Japanese mounds include those of sea snails, surf clams (Mactra veneriformes), and Japanese littleneck clams (Tapes japonica).|$|R

[...] "He {{is about}} the size of Unc' Billy Possum, and if you can imagine a pig of about that size with very short legs, a long {{tapering}} tail, feet with toes and long <b>claws</b> and a <b>shell</b> covering his whole body, the front of his face and even his tail, you will have something of an idea what he looks like.|$|R
50|$|Feathers {{are among}} the most complex {{integumentary}} appendages found in vertebrates and are formed in tiny follicles in the epidermis, or outer skin layer, that produce keratin proteins. The β-keratins in feathers, beaks and claws — and the <b>claws,</b> scales and <b>shells</b> of reptiles — are composed of protein strands hydrogen-bonded into β-pleated sheets, which are then further twisted and crosslinked by disulfide bridges into structures even tougher than the α-keratins of mammalian hair, horns and hoof. The exact signals that induce the growth of feathers on the skin are not known, but it has been found that the transcription factor cDermo-1 induces the growth of feathers on skin and scales on the leg.|$|R
50|$|Although our {{recorded}} {{history of the}} tribes in this region does not begin until the explorers and missionaries arrived, {{there is evidence of}} many tribal settlements in the area later known as Cambria. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 people inhabited the area in the time (some 1000 years) before the Spanish arrived. Experts believe these tribes to have been migratory and used Cambria as a seasonal settlement; other scientists are convinced that they lived there permanently. Most agree that they fed themselves with shellfish and seafood, as well as obtaining food from travels inland to hunt and gather seeds. A variety of artistically-crafted implements have been discovered, including spears points and arrowheads made from obsidian; basalt, sandstone, and granite were used to make mortars and pestles; soapstone kettles and stone hammers were also found. These early inhabitants were skilled basket and net makers and fashioned jewelry from crab <b>claws,</b> abalone <b>shells,</b> and the teeth of sharks and whales. The presence of soapstone (steatite) provides evidence that they traded with the Catalina Island tribes, whereas the lack of metals and glass indicates that they did not trade with Europeans or Asians.|$|R
500|$|Despite their organic appearance, Oliver's {{own view}} was that her work was not {{grounded}} in nature's structures. [...] Nevertheless, critics have identified the lifelike qualities of early pieces that resembled <b>shells,</b> <b>claws</b> or tails, or noted the apparent similarities to biological forms. McDonald commented that [...] "For Oliver to deny nature is akin to Balthus saying there is nothing erotic about his paintings or Rothko claiming his works aren't abstract." [...] Both major reviews of Oliver's work (Fenner's 1995 essay and Fink's 2002 journal article) draw attention to dualism and contradiction in the sculptures: Fenner describes them as [...] "delicate and ephemeral, [...] structurally robust and durable"; Fink sees them as [...] "ethereal but solid, fluid yet rigid, open but closed".|$|R
50|$|Milking {{machines}} {{are used to}} harvest milk from cows when manual milking becomes inefficient or labour-intensive. One early model was patented in 1907. The milking unit is the portion of a milking machine for removing milk from an udder. It {{is made up of}} a <b>claw,</b> four teatcups, (<b>Shells</b> and rubber liners) long milk tube, long pulsation tube, and a pulsator. The claw is an assembly that connects the short pulse tubes and short milk tubes from the teatcups to the long pulse tube and long milk tube. (Cluster assembly) Claws are commonly made of stainless steel or plastic or both. Teatcups are composed of a rigid outer shell (stainless steel or plastic) that holds a soft inner liner or inflation. Transparent sections in the shell may allow viewing of liner collapse and milk flow. The annular space between the shell and liner is called the pulse chamber.|$|R
40|$|The “Macrobiotus hufelandi group” is {{characterized}} by species which share some distinguishing animal and egg shell characters. In general, they have two rod-shaped macroplacoids and an evident microplacoid, eye spots, pores on the cuticle, medium sized <b>claws,</b> egg <b>shell</b> with inverted goblet-like processes, and spermatozoa with corkscrew-shaped head. We {{had the opportunity to}} analyse one species, Macrobiotus glebkai Biserov, 1990, found in Eastern Ukraine, which shows characters of the group in the animals, but a peculiar egg shell morphology. We have carried out a phylogenetic analysis on the 18 S nuclear gene in order to verify the systematic position of this species. This analysis has been followed by an integrated study on morphology by LM and SEM, sex ratio, karyology and DNA barcoding (mtDNA cox 1). The phylogenetic tree based on 18 S sequences grouped M. glebkai with M. hufelandi and other related species with inverted goblet-like processes on the egg shell. This evidences that the egg shell morphology can sometimes be more variable than that of the animals. In depth morphological analysis allowed us to define details of both animals and eggs of M. glebkai, which showed the same characters as the Russian type material (that we also investigated). We verified that the population from Eastern Ukraine was composed by females and males and that the spermatozoon morphology is in line with that found in the various species of the “Macrobiotus hufelandi group”. The oocytes contain bivalents, but their number has to be specified, as oocytes of some specimens appeared to contain more than 6 bivalents (6 bivalents is the usual pattern for amphimictic species of the “M. hufelandi group”). The DNA barcoding has evidenced the presence of three haplotypes (Kimura 2 -parameter distances: 0. 2 - 0. 3...|$|R
5000|$|Mangetsu (マンゲツ) : One of the Generals under Tsukikage, {{vying for}} his position. He {{is a huge}} rabbit with a {{sinister}} look to him, dressed in a different style of uniform from the other generals. This indicates that he's either a general of a different branch of the [...] "Moon Army" [...] that came down, or all the other generals are of a higher rank than him. He concocts a plan to deliver Yaiba to Kaguya, which fails. Mongetzu then decides to take action by assaulting Yaiba directly. The fight ends up in a seafood restaurant where Mongetzu demonstrates the 'true power of the moon people' by brandishing a lobster, then yelling [...] "Gatai!". Once the smoke cleared, Mongetzu was now part lobster, with <b>claws,</b> gleaming red <b>shell</b> armor, and (as all Gatai forms have) big rabbit ears. The next Gatai Mongetzu attempted was with a propane tank, which gave him the power to breathe fire. Yaiba defeated him {{using a combination of}} the [...] "Big" [...] orb and the [...] "Fire" [...] orb he had earned at this point, and blasted Mongetzu clear back to the Moon Bunny base. For his failure, Kaguya disintegrated him.|$|R
6000|$|Lancelot had stuttered horribly {{during the}} latter part of this most heterodox outburst, for he had begun to think about himself, and try to say a fine thing, suspecting all the while that it might not be true. But Argemone did not remark the stammering: the new {{thoughts}} startled and pained her; but there was a daring grace about them. [...] She tried, as women will, to answer him with arguments, and failed, as women will fail. She was accustomed to lay down the law a la Madame de Stael, to savants and non-savants and be heard with reverence, as a woman should be. But poor truth-seeking Lancelot did not see what sex had to do with logic; he flew at her {{as if she had been}} a very barrister, and hunted her mercilessly up and down through all sorts of charming sophisms, as she begged the question, and shifted her ground, as thoroughly right in her conclusion as she was wrong in her reasoning, till she grew quite confused and pettish.--And then Lancelot suddenly shrank into his <b>shell,</b> <b>claws</b> and all, like an affrighted soldier-crab, hung down his head, and stammered out some incoherencies,--'N-n-not accustomed to talk to women--ladies, I mean. F-forgot myself.--Pray forgive me!' And he looked up, and her eyes, half-amused, met his, and she saw that they were filled with tears.|$|R
50|$|The website “Native American Myths of Creation” {{offers the}} story for the Lakota tribes’ myth: The Earth that was before this one, the people of that world did not behave themselves. The Creating Power was {{dissatisfied}} {{so he decided to}} bring a very heavy rain that flooded the whole Earth. All the people and almost all the animals died except for Kangi, which was a crow. The crow asked the Creating Power to create him a new resting spot so the Creating Power decided to create the new world. Creating Power had a huge pipe bag that had all types of animals and birds in it. He selected four animals that could survive underwater for long periods of time. He told each animal to grab a clump of mud from underwater. First the dove tried and failed. Then the otter tried but also failed to reach the bottom. Next the beaver tried but he too also failed. The Creating Power was about to give up hope but decided to try the turtle. The turtle had stayed underwater for so long everyone was sure he had drowned. But then he broke the water’s surface with mud clenched in his mouth, feet, <b>claws</b> and turtle <b>shell.</b> The mud became the resting place for the turtle and crow while the Creating Power shook two long eagle feathers which caused the mud to expand across the water to form a dry surface. The Creating Power was saddened for how dry the land was which caused him to cry which now are the oceans, stream, and lakes. He named this new Earth Turtle Continent. He released more animals from his pipe bag to roam the new Earth and created human from red, white, black, and yellow Earth. He gave the new people his sacred pipe and told them do good and warned them about what happened to the people before then when they started living bad.|$|R
