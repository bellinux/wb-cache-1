5|$|Initially {{released}} {{under the}} name Automonopoli, Waddingtons threatened legal action against Automata, and within weeks of its release the game was rebranded as Go to Jail. Waddingtons, concerned about the potential impact on a forthcoming official Monopoly video game, began formal <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> against Automata in late 1983, and the game was withdrawn from sale in early 1984.|$|E
5|$|The DeKalb County Courthouse serves DeKalb County, Illinois as {{its main}} {{judiciary}} building. As such, {{it is the}} location of any trials and <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the county. The DeKalb County Circuit Court falls under the Illinois 16th Judicial Circuit, along with the circuit courts in Kendall and Kane Counties. Through its 100-year history prominent criminal trials and other events have occurred at the courthouse.|$|E

Magistrates' courts (including youth <b>courts,</b> family <b>proceedings</b> <b>courts</b> and {{domestic}} <b>proceedings</b> <b>courts)</b> hear less-serious criminal cases and conduct preliminary hearings in more serious criminal cases. They {{are divided into}} 21 petty sessions districts. The Crown Court hears all serious criminal cases which are committed to trial. When sitting as family <b>proceedings</b> <b>courts</b> the magistrates' <b>courts</b> hear <b>proceedings</b> brought under the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995.|$|R

A Polish {{interpreter}} explained the <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> to the musicians over a speakerphone {{after which they}} entered their pleas in English. Spokane County Superior Court Judge Annette Plese set their trial date for December 18, though she said that date is very likely to be postponed.|$|E
5|$|Around 1760, Jones hired Samuel Dew of Richmond County {{to serve}} as his deputy clerk. Dew apprenticed under Jones for 21 years, {{occasionally}} performing duties as acting clerk. Due to his close relationship with Lord Fairfax, {{it is likely that}} Jones was Clerk of Court of neighboring counties also under the ownership of Lord Fairfax's Northern Neck Proprietary. According to Maxwell and Swisher, Jones relied upon his deputy clerks, such as Dew, to transcribe and document <b>court</b> <b>proceedings,</b> which Jones traveled among the various counties to sign.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning. Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of nine officers. The {{experiences}} Robinson was subjected to during the <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> would be remembered when he later joined MLB and was subjected to racist attacks. Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas; thus, he never saw combat action.|$|E

5|$|Compounding matters was {{the fact}} that the {{supposedly}} deceased actors had signed contracts with the production which ensured that they would not appear in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. This was done in order to promote the idea that Cannibal Holocaust was truly the recovered footage of missing documentarians. During the subsequent <b>court</b> <b>proceedings,</b> questions arose as to why the actors were in no other media if they were alive as Deodato claimed.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{the protests}} became an armed {{rebellion}}. The first {{shots were fired}} at the Oliver Miller Homestead in present-day South Park Township, Pennsylvania, about ten miles south of Pittsburgh. As word of the rebellion spread across the frontier, {{a whole series of}} loosely organized resistance measures were taken, including robbing the mail, stopping <b>court</b> <b>proceedings,</b> and the threat of an assault on Pittsburgh. One group disguised as women assaulted a tax collector, cropped his hair, coated him with tar and feathers, and stole his horse. Another group bombarded the estate of the tax collector John Neville, a friend of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 an {{organization}} he co-founded, People for Legal and Nonsectarian Schools (PLANS, Inc.), filed a federal lawsuit against Sacramento City Unified School District and Twin Ridges Elementary School District in California arguing that their Waldorf-methods-inspired schools violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article IX of the California Constitution.

5|$|Jennings's salary as governor, {{which was}} the highest for an elected {{official}} in the state, was $1,000. Under the constitution, the governor served a three-year term and was prohibited from serving more that six years in a nine-year period. Jennings's agenda called for establishing <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> to secure justice, organizing a state-funded educational systems, creating a state banking system, preventing unlawful seizure and enslavement of free blacks, organizing a state library, and planning internal improvements. His efforts had limited success, due, in part, to the state's limited financial resources and Jennings's limited powers as governor.|$|E

5|$|Allegedly, Vattier {{had tried}} to take title {{to a piece of}} {{property}} in Cincinnati already owned by the Hinde family. Hinde challenged Vattier in court. Henry Clay represented Hinde in the Ohio State <b>Court</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Hinde claimed that Vattier tried to use the lot to pay Findlay by claiming to have a bill of sale and title that was superior to the Hinde family. After more than fifteen years, the case reached the United States Supreme Court in 1833. The Court ruled that Vattier took title to the property illegally and that the property belonged to Hinde and his children. Originally owned by Hinde's father-in-law, James Bradford, after his death the property passed to Hinde's wife, Belinda (Bradford) Hinde.|$|E

5|$|Epstein accused Seltaeb of not {{accounting}} properly, and cancelled {{its power}} to grant licences, which started a counter-lawsuit by Byrne against Epstein's New York accountant, Walter Hofer, asking for $5,168,000 in damages. Epstein then instructed NEMS employees to deal directly with American companies, so Byrne instigated <b>court</b> <b>proceedings,</b> which took three years to settle, as it entailed 39 individual claims against NEMS. Byrne won the case, and Epstein paid the court costs and legal bills himself, although the judgement was later vacated; meaning to cancel it, or render it null and void. Due to the legal battle, Woolworth's, J. C. Penney, and other companies refused to finalise any merchandising agreements, cancelling orders worth $78 million. The court case and its effect was estimated to have lost NEMS and The Beatles approximately $100,000,000.|$|E

Official communication between states and between states and the Union would be in the official language of the union (Article 345). English would be used for all legal purposes â in <b>court</b> <b>proceedings,</b> bills, laws, rules and other regulations (Article 348). The Union was duty bound to promote the spread and usage of Hindi (Article 351).|$|E
5|$|In {{ex parte}} Hosenball, Lord Denning {{referred}} to Lord Reid's comments in R. v. Lewes Justices, ex parte Secretary of State for Home Department (1972), {{that there was}} a public interest for certain documents in the police's possession not to be produced during <b>court</b> <b>proceedings,</b> otherwise members of the public might withhold information from the police if they realized the potential existed for the information to be disclosed to the Gaming Board. Such withholding of information would prevent the police from properly discharging their statutory duty of ensuring that unsuitable persons were not granted licences to run gaming establishments. Lord Reid stated that the requirement for natural justice in that case was clearly outweighed by the public interest.|$|E

5|$|Jackson's {{earliest}} public controversy {{came when}} he was linked to alleged Nigerian drug trafficker Pius Ailemen. Ailemen {{was supposed to be}} Jackson's best man at his 1991 wedding, but canceled at the last minute due to supposed passport-related issues. Jackson and Aileman were investigated by the FBI; the investigation and <b>court</b> <b>proceedings</b> extended for several years. A wiretap recorded many conversations between the two, and financial records indicate that Ailemen had purchased an Alfa Romeo using a $13,000 charge on Jackson's credit card. Ailemen was sentenced to 24 years and four months in jail. In 2003, Ailemen was denied petition for a writ of certiorari. Ailemen's current motion questions Jackson's activities as a government informant {{at the time of his}} testimony in Ailemen's trial.|$|E
5|$|News {{coverage}} of legal actions also provided considerable free publicity. Variety reported that lines for the Broadway production stretched {{around the corner}} after it was condemned in the magistrates' court. Before the <b>court</b> <b>proceedings,</b> the play was earning about $12,000 per week. After proceedings began, the box office increased to $14,000â15,000 per week, which Variety described as near the theater's capacity. Woods added matinees and increased the top ticket prices; the weekly box office reached over $17,000 {{at the end of}} November. By the time the production closed, {{it was one of the}} most successful of that season, having sold over 200,000 tickets across 268 performances.|$|E
5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor {{guilty of}} the first-degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King.
