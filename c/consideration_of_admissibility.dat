However this on its own was not sufficient for the initiation of an investigation by the ICC because the Statute requires <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> before the Court, in light of the gravity of the crimes.

5000|$|Moreno-Ocampo went on {{to explain}} that this on its own is not {{sufficient}} for the initiation of an investigation by the International Criminal Court since the Statute requires <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> before the Court, in light of the gravity of the crimes. In examining this criterion, he explained:For war crimes, a specific gravity threshold is set down in Article 8(1), which states that [...] "the Court shall have jurisdiction in respect of war crimes in particular when committed as part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes". This threshold is not an element of the crime, and the words [...] "in particular" [...] suggest {{that this is not a}} strict requirement. It does, however, provide Statute guidance that the Court is intended to focus on situations meeting these requirements. According to the available information, it did not appear that any of the criteria of Article 8(1) were satisfied. Even if one were to assume that Article 8(1) had been satisfied, it would then be necessary to consider the general gravity requirement under Article 53(1)(b). The Office considers various factors in assessing gravity. A key consideration is the number of victims of particularly serious crimes, such as wilful killing or rape. The number of potential victims of crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court in this situation - 4 to 12 victims of willful killing and a limited number of victims of inhuman treatment - was of a different order than the number of victims found in other situations under investigation or analysis by the Office. It is worth bearing in mind that the OTP is currently investigating three situations involving long-running conflicts in Northern Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Darfur. Each of the three situations under investigation involves thousands of wilful killings as well as intentional and large-scale sexual violence and abductions. Collectively, they have resulted in the displacement of more than 5 million people. Other situations under analysis also feature hundreds or thousands of such crimes. Taking into account all the considerations, the situation did not appear to meet the required threshold of the Statute. In light of the conclusion reached on gravity, it was unnecessary to reach a conclusion on complementarity. It may be observed, however, that the Office also collected information on national proceedings, including commentaries from various sources, and that national proceedings had been initiated with respect to each of the relevant incidents.Moreno-Ocampo qualified this statement by noting that [...] "this conclusion can be reconsidered in the light of new facts or evidence." ...|$|E

This paper mainly focuses on the special location issues in the digital and flexible trimming process for aircraft skins fastened by reconfigurable fixture. Firstly, {{in view of the}} dynamic change of effective locators, the “X- 2 - 1 ” location principle was proposed with reference to the “ 3 - 2 - 1 ” and “N- 2 - 1 ” location schemes. Secondly, the standard procedure for solving location parameters was summarized in <b>consideration</b> <b>of</b> location <b>admissibility,</b> holding posture, locator layout and so on. Thirdly, a locating experiment was conducted to investigate the positional accuracy of the reconfigurable fixture and the calculation accuracy of location parameters solution. Fourthly, a quantitative evaluation method to evaluate the dynamic stiffness of the fixturing system was put forward. Moreover, the effects of location layout on the dynamic stiffness were analyzed using the finite element simulation system for the trimming process. A  noticeable appearance had been observed that the cliff effect of the dynamic stiffness of the flexible fixturing system may be induced due to the dynamic change of effective locators. Finally, some conclusions and discussion on future works were given...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine the {{challenges}} posed by Information and Communication Technology (ICT) developments {{on the law}} and practice <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> documentary evidence by Tanzanian courts. Particular focus is put on the issues <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> computer printouts in courts. The main argument advanced in this thesis is that the Tanzania Evidence Act, 1967 (the TEA), being developed without reference to digital technologies, is inadequate to govern the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> computer printouts with sensible results. The methodology of data collection deployed in this thesis is predominantly documentary review. Throughout, I have made substantial reference to the landmark case in Trust Bank Tanzania Ltd versus Le-Marsh Enterprises Ltd and Others to analyze the legal issues emerging from dealing with computer printouts in the courtroom when their admissibility is at issue. This case is the only available decision in Tanzania to deal with <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> computer printouts. In fulfilling the above mission, this thesis is organized in five Chapters. Chapter One sets out {{the aims of the}} thesis, background information to the problem <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> computer printouts in courts, and literature review of previous works on the subject. The notion of electronic document is treated in Chapter Two. Chapter Three specifically focuses on bankers’ books {{as a result of the}} landmark case cited above. Chapter Four briefly reviews the evidentiary rules <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> documentary evidence: the best evidence rule, the rule against hearsay and authentication at common law and under the TEA, 1967. It also deals with an interpretative approach of Tanzanian courts in admitting computer printouts in the form of bankers’ books. Chapter Five comprises concluding remarks and recommendations...|$|R

40|$|Thesis by publication. Bibliography: pages 215 - 229. 1. Introduction [...] 2. The {{localization}} <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> and the admissibility backings [...] 3. The role of one {{argument in}} <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> another and the propagation <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> backings [...] 4. Context sensitive defeasible rules [...] 5. Conclusion. Abstract argumentation frameworks {{are used to}} study various aspects of interaction between arguments. One most fundamental such interaction is that some arguments may attack some other arguments. In a sense, only those arguments finally matter that are successfully defended against the attackers. Such arguments are called admissible. This thesis incorporates three papers {{in this area of}} research, two of which are devoted to the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> arguments. The first paper introduces the notion <b>of</b> the <b>admissibility</b> backing <b>of</b> an argument – a minimal set of admissible arguments that can successfully defend (respectively attack) a given argument against its attackers (defenders). This paper shows how admissible backings can help us localize the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> an argument. It does so by separating those arguments that are relevant to the <b>admissibility</b> <b>of</b> a given argument from those that are not. Independent corroboration for this approach is provided by showing how major results in Dung’s approach to argumentation can be obtained using admissibility backings. The second paper explores the propagation <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> backings in the following sense: under what condition, and in what way, an <b>admissibility</b> backing <b>of</b> a given argument will contribute to the backing of a different argument? It is shown that under certain conditions, the propagation is transitive. It is further shown how the propagation <b>of</b> <b>admissibility</b> backings can be used to partition an argumentation framework to independent sub-frameworks. This is indicative of an interesting approach to the splitting and merging of different argumentation frameworks, a theoretical investigation of which is left for future research. The last paper explores a novel approach to marrying the argumentation frameworks to defeasible reasoning. The desired goal behind this approach is that an argument that is deemed justied in an argumentation framework should indeed satisfy our expectations as per defeasible reasoning. The efficacy of this approach is shown by providing a mapping from it to Dung’s argumentation framework. Mode of access: World wide web 1 online resource (xx, 235 pages...|$|R
