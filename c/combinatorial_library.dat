40|$|SummarySeveral {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} for screening <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> or collections of synthetic molecules for agonists or antagonists of protein function, each with its own advantages and limitations. In this report, we describe an experimental platform that seamlessly couples massively parallel bead-based screening of one-bead one-compound <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> with microarray-based quantitative comparisons of the binding affinities of the many hits isolated from the bead library. Combined with other technical improvements, this technique allows the rapid identification of the best protein ligands in <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> containing millions of compounds without the need for labor-intensive resynthesis of the hits...|$|R
40|$|This paper commences {{with a brief}} {{introduction}} to modern techniques for the computational analysis of molecular diversity and the design of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries.</b> It then reviews dissimilarity-based algorithms for the selection of structurally diverse sets of compounds in chemical databases. Procedures are described for selecting a diverse subset of an entire database, and for selecting diverse <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> using both reagent-based and product-based selection...|$|R
50|$|The {{components}} of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> {{can also be}} tested one by one after cleaving them from the individual beads.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional {{methods of}} analysis, like {{high-performance}} liquid chromatography (HPLC), {{can be used to}} identify the purity of a <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library,</b> but assays need to be rapid with good resolution for all components to provide useful information for the chemist. [...] The introduction of surfactant to traditional capillary electrophoresis instrumentation has dramatically expanded the scope of analytes that can be separated by capillary electrophoresis.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional combinatorial synthesis where {{a library of}} catalysts were first generated and later screened (as in the two above approaches), dynamic <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> approach utilizes a mixture of multicomponent building blocks that reversibly form library of catalysts. With out a template, the library consists of a roughly equal mixture of different combination of building blocks. In {{the presence of a}} template which is either a starting material or a TSA, the combination that provides the best binding to the template is thermodynamically favorable and thus that combination is more prevalent than other library members. The biased ratio of the desired catalyst to other combinatorial products could then be frozen by terminating the reversibility of the equilibrium by means such as change in temperature, pH, or radiation to yield the optimal catalyst. For example, Lehn et al. used this method to create a dynamic <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> of imine inhibitor from a set of amines and a set of aldehydes. After some time, the equilibrium was terminated by an addition of NaBH3CN to afford the desired catalyst.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} of the Kröhnke synthesis is its high atom economy. For example, the Tschitschibanan synthesis requires 2 equivalents of unsaturated starting material. Additionally, the byproducts of the Kröhnke synthesis is water and pyridine, which allow for easy workup and purification protocols. Unlike comparable methods for pyridine synthesis, the Kröhkne synthesis benefits from being a high-yielding one pot synthesis, which ultimately allows for abbreviation of synthetic pathways and further simplifies <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> cataloging.|$|E
40|$|Automation in {{combination}} with high throughput screening methods has revolutionised molecular biology {{in the last two}} decades. Today, many <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> as well as several systems for automation are available. Depending on scope, budget and time, a different combination of library and experimental handling might be most effective. In this review we will discuss several concepts of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> and provide information as what to expect from these depending on the given context...|$|R
40|$|Combinatorial Chemistry is a {{powerful}} new technology in drug design and molecular recognition. It is a wet-laboratory methodology aimed at "massively parallel" screening of chemical compounds for the discovery of compounds that have a certain biological activity. The power of the method comes from the interaction between experimental design and computational modeling. Principles of "rational" drug design {{are used in the}} design of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> to speed up the discovery of lead compounds with the desired biological activity. This paper presents algorithms, software development and computational complexity analysis for problems arising in the design of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> for drug discovery. We provide exact polynomial time algorithms and intractability results for several Inverse Problems [...] formulated as (chemical) graph reconstruction problems [...] related to the design of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries.</b> These are the first such results in the literature. We also provide results [...] ...|$|R
40|$|High-throughput {{screening}} (HTS) using high-density microplates is {{the primary}} method for the discovery of novel lead candidate molecules. However, new strategies that eschew 2 D microplate technology, including technologies that enable mass screening of targets against large <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries,</b> {{have the potential to}} greatly increase throughput and decrease unit cost. This review presents an overview of state-of-the-art microplate-based HTS technology and includes a discussion of emerging miniaturized systems for HTS. We focus on new methods of encoding <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> that promise throughputs of as many as 100 000 compounds per second...|$|R
50|$|The {{synthesized}} {{molecules of}} a <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> are 'cleaved' from the solid support and mixed into solution. In such solution, millions of different compounds may be found. When this synthetic method was developed, it first seemed impossible {{to identify the}} molecules, and to find molecules with useful properties. Strategies of purification, identification, and screening were developed, however, to solve the problem. All these strategies are based on synthesis and testing of partial libraries.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, D.R. Halpin and P.B. Harbury {{presented}} a novel intriguing method {{for the construction}} of DNA-encoded libraries. For the first time the DNA-conjugated templates served for both encoding and programming the infrastructure of the “split-&-pool” synthesis of the library components. The design of Halpin and Harbury enabled alternating rounds of selection, PCR amplification and diversification with small organic molecules, in complete analogy to phage display technology. The DNA-routing machinery consists of a series of connected columns bearing resin-bound anticodons, which could sequence-specifically separate a population of DNA-templates into spatially distinct locations by hybridization. According to this split-and-pool protocol a peptide <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> DNA-encoded of 106 members was generated.|$|E
50|$|Dynamic {{combinatorial}} chemistry (DCC; {{also known as}} dynamic covalent chemistry) is a method to the generation of new molecules formed by reversible reaction of simple building blocks under thermodynamic control. The library of these reversibly interconverting building blocks is called a dynamic <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> (DCL). All constituents in a DCL are in equilibrium, and their distribution is determined by their thermodynamic stability within the DCL. The interconversion of these building blocks may involve covalent or non-covalent interactions. When a DCL is exposed to an external influence (such as proteins or nucleic acids), the equilibrium shifts and those components that interact with the external influence are stabilised and amplified, allowing more of the active compound to be formed.|$|E

New opioid compounds have also been identified from peptidomimetic libraries, such as peptoids and alkylated dipeptides, and those identified from acyclic (eg, polyamine, urea) and heterocyclic (eg, bicyclic guanidine) libraries are reviewed...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{versatile}} computer model of diverse dynamic <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries,</b> and examine how molecular recognition between library members and a template {{can be used}} to amplify the best binders. The correlation between host-guest binding and amplification was examined for a set of 50 libraries with > 300 components each over a wide range of template and building block concentrations. Depending on these concentrations correlations vary from poor (when using a large excess of template) to good (for very dilute libraries and/or substoichiometric template concentrations), highlighting the need to choose the experimental conditions for dynamic <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> thoughtfully. ...|$|R
50|$|Gene {{promoters}} {{are responsible}} for recruiting RNAP and facilitating transcription of DNA. Type I promoters consists of a consensus -35 and -10 region (Pribnow Box) upstream of the gene start site. Heidorn et al. 2011 {{compiled a list of}} native Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 promoters that have been used in synthetic constructs, although this leads to cross talk and non-orthogonal or non-specific gene expression. A handful of Anderson promoters (a group of constitutive promoters collected from a <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> based on the consensus -35 (5’-TTGACA-3’) and -10 (5’-TATAAT-3’) regions), represented best by BBa_J23101, have been demonstrated to function in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. The iGem Registry hosts these promoter sequences as part of the BioBrick initiative to create interchangeable genetic parts. For synthetic biology, it is critical to have inducible promoters, or genes that can be turned on/off on demand. Several popular inducible promoters in E. coli are the pBad, pTet, and pLac promoters, all of which repress gene expression by a repressor molecule that binds the gene operator and blocks RNAP progression.|$|E
5000|$|Recently (January 2014), {{the first}} {{therapeutic}} compound targeted at the HIV-1 ribosomal frameshift signal {{was reported by}} Ofori et al. [...] The lead compound was developed from a [...] "hit" [...] compound discovered through a resin-bound dynamic <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> screen, and the structure is shown at right. [...] The EC50 values were reported to be 3.9uM for the Z conformation and 25.6uM for the E conformation. Interestingly, the lead compound is symmetrical whereas the target downstream secondary RNA structure is non-symmetrical, suggesting that both supposed intercalators are necessary for high-affinity binding. [...] Using a dual-luciferase assay, they concluded that the compound functions by enhancing the frameshifting efficiency of the HIV-1 ribosomal frameshift signal, resulting in {{a decrease in the}} Gag/Gag-Pol protein ratio and thereby preventing the proper maturation of the viral particle and ultimately inhibiting infection. [...] Moving forward, structural studies of the interactions between the lead compound and the downstream secondary RNA structure of the HIV-1 ribosomal frameshift signal will be vital to understanding the reason for high affinity and the method of action.|$|E
50|$|As above mentioned, {{combinatorial}} chemistry {{was a key}} technology enabling the efficient generation of large screening libraries {{for the needs of}} high-throughput screening. However, now, after two decades of {{combinatorial chemistry}}, it has been pointed out that despite the increased efficiency in chemical synthesis, no increase in lead or drug candidates has been reached. This has led to analysis of chemical characteristics of combinatorial chemistry products, compared to existing drugs or natural products. The chemoinformatics concept chemical diversity, depicted as distribution of compounds in the chemical space based on their physicochemical characteristics, is often used to describe the difference between the combinatorial chemistry libraries and natural products. The synthetic, <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> compounds seem to cover only a limited and quite uniform chemical space, whereas existing drugs and particularly natural products, exhibit much greater chemical diversity, distributing more evenly to the chemical space. The most prominent differences between natural products and compounds in combinatorial chemistry libraries is the number of chiral centers (much higher in natural compounds), structure rigidity (higher in natural compounds) and number of aromatic moieties (higher in combinatorial chemistry libraries). Other chemical differences between these two groups include the nature of heteroatoms (O and N enriched in natural products, and S and halogen atoms more often present in synthetic compounds), as well as level of non-aromatic unsaturation (higher in natural products). As both structure rigidity and chirality are both well-established factors in medicinal chemistry known to enhance compounds specificity and efficacy as a drug, {{it has been suggested that}} natural products compare favourable to today's combinatorial chemistry libraries as potential lead molecules.|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of pharmacologically promising compounds (lead compounds) from <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> is frequently {{limited by the}} throughput of the analytical technique employed.

40|$|<b>Combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> {{continue}} to {{play a key role in}} drug discovery. To increase structural diversity, several experimental methods have been developed. However, limited efforts have been performed so far to quantify the diversity of the broadly used diversity-oriented synthetic (DOS) libraries. Herein we report a comprehensive characterization of 15 bis-diazacyclic <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> obtained through libraries from libraries, which is a DOS approach. Using MACCS keys, radial and different pharmacophoric fingerprints as well as six molecular properties, it was demonstrated the increased structural and property diversity of the libraries from libraries over the individual libraries. Comparison of the libraries to existing drugs, NCI Diversity and the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository revealed the structural uniqueness of the <b>combinatorial</b> <b>libraries</b> (mean similarity < 0. 5 for any fingerprint representation). In particular, bis-cyclic thiourea libraries were the most structurally dissimilar to drugs retaining drug-like character in property space. This study represents the first comprehensive quantification of the diversity of libraries from libraries providing a solid quantitative approach to compare and contrast the diversity of DOS libraries with existing drugs or any other compound collection...|$|R
40|$|AbstractÐThe {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} the complex between an HIV- 1 cell-entry inhibitor selected from screening a <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> of non-natural building blocks and the central, trimeric, coiled-coil core of HIV- 1 gp 41 has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The biased <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> was designed to identify ligands binding in nonpolar pockets {{on the surface of}} the coiled-coil core of gp 41. The crystal structure shows that the non-peptide moiety of the inhibitor binds to the targeted cavity in two di€erent binding modes.

40|$|A {{new method}} of drug discovery, the pseudo-dynamic <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library,</b> is described. The {{technique}} involves expanding on the dynamic <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> method, where a reversible synthetic reaction {{is carried out}} {{in the presence of a}} target. In the pseudo-dynamic <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library,</b> this reversible reaction is separated into two irreversible steps. The independent control of the two steps leads to superior selectivity in the screening process. A model system based on peptidic inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase was developed and studied. The synthesis of a series of new carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is described. Amino acids with sulfonamide and sulfamide functional groups, which are known to bind to carbonic anhydrase, were prepared. The synthesis of a series of active esters attached to solid support are described. The tetrafluorophenyl esters are shown to be ideal for amide bond formation in aqueous media. The properties of this class of active esters were investigated. Initial studies on a static library screening method are reported.

40|$|Protein-directed dynamic {{combinatorial}} chemistry is an emerging technique for efficient discovery of novel chemical structures for binding to a target protein. Typically, this method {{relies on a}} library of small molecules that react reversibly {{with each other to}} generate a <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library.</b> The components in the <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library</b> are at equilibrium with each other under thermodynamic control. When a protein is added to the equilibrium mixture, and if the protein interacts with any components of the <b>combinatorial</b> <b>library,</b> the position of the equilibrium will shift and those components that interact with the protein will be amplified, which can then be identified by a suitable biophysical technique. Such information is useful as a starting point to guide further organic synthesis of novel protein ligands and enzyme inhibitors.
