500|$|Holby City has {{attracted}} comparisons to other medical dramas, often unfavourable. In November 2002, John Whiston, {{then head of}} drama at Granada Television, accused the BBC of producing [...] "ersatz parodies" [...] of ITV drama, commenting that: [...] "With Holby City cloned out of Casualty, the BBC has even ended up copying itself." [...] Paul Hoggart of The Times has written that {{the differences between the}} two shows are [...] "mild", calling Holby City: [...] "Casualty <b>cute</b> <b>little</b> sister". Kevin Lygo, director of television at Channel 4, referred to Holby City as [...] "sudsy drama", deeming it, Casualty and HolbyBlue [...] "all decent programmes, but strikingly similar in many aspects of their tone and construction." [...] Holby City has also been unfavourably compared with the American medical drama ER. Television producer Paul Abbott has commented that although he watches ER, he does not watch Holby City as: [...] "it looks like you've crammed one hour's drama into 26 episodes." [...] In October 2009, former Holby City writer Peter Jukes wrote a critical piece for Prospect magazine, contrasting the show negatively with the standard of American television dramas. Jukes wrote that Holby City has become a soap opera, rather than a drama, and deemed the episodes he worked on [...] "the most dispiriting experiences in [...] 25 years as a dramatist." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} several negative reviews. Andrew Billen, writing for The Times, lamented that Davies had [...] "forgotten that Doctor Who's main {{task is to}} send children scuttling behind sofas while entertaining their fathers with the odd philosophical idea, the occasional classical reference, a joke or two they would probably not wish to explain and a wee bit of space totty". Billen also criticised the writing and acting, but commended Tate for a [...] "toned down performance". Alan Stanley Blair of SyFy Portal summarised it as [...] "a runaway Saturday morning cartoon in desperate need to a solid story". Blair found flaws with the comedy and the music in the episode, but was impressed with Tate's acting and Piper's cameo. Kevin O'Sullivan of the Sunday Mirror criticised Tate and Tennant for overacting, and had concerns about the writing: [...] "It didn't exactly ooze tension. All {{we got in the}} way of terrifying space enemies was Sarah Lancashire hamming it up as an intergalactic super nanny, a couple of security guards with guns and lots of <b>cute</b> <b>little</b> fat babies." [...] Ian Hyland of News of the World criticised the child-friendly storyline, comparing it to [...] "the back of a fag packet". He also criticised Tennant for appearing [...] "jaded" [...] and Tate for [...] "still shouting".|$|E
500|$|Early scenes {{animated}} by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston show that Pinocchio's design was exactly {{like that of}} a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose, a peaked cap and bare wooden hands. Walt Disney, however, was not pleased with the work that was being done on the film. He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production. Fred Moore redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing but the design still retained a wooden feel. Young and upcoming animator Milt Kahl felt that Thomas, Johnston and Moore were [...] "rather obsessed with the idea of this boy being a wooden puppet" [...] and felt that they should [...] "forget that he was a puppet and get a <b>cute</b> <b>little</b> boy; you can always draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards". Hamilton Luske suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence. Kahl showed Disney a test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father. From this scene Kahl re-envisioned the character by making him look more like a real boy, with a child's Tyrolean hat and standard cartoon character four-fingered (or three and a thumb) hands with Mickey Mouse-type gloves on them. The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms, legs and his little button wooden nose. Disney embraced Kahl's scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent, naïve, somewhat coy personality that reflected Kahl's design.|$|E
500|$|Belle has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, {{several of}} whom voiced their {{preference for the}} character over her predecessor, Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post described Belle as a [...] "compelling" [...] character who is [...] "more mature, more womanly and less blandly asexual" [...] than Ariel, as well as [...] "a more worldly girl", describing her as [...] "a bookworm, with gumption and a mind of her own." [...] Similarly comparing Belle to Ariel, John Hartl of The Seattle Times wrote that, in Beauty and the Beast, [...] "there's rarely a sense of deja vu, perhaps because the heroine is so different from 'Mermaid's' dependent Ariel, and her dilemma is more poignant," [...] while Boxoffice scribed, [...] "Undoubtedly in response to criticism that the <b>cute</b> <b>little</b> 'Mermaid' Ariel {{was nothing more than}} a precocious sexpot, the idea-people behind this beauty—aptly named Belle ... chose to make her an icon of self-reliance and a voracious reader with a curiosity and love for everything around her." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail extolled Belle as a [...] "smart, courageous ... 'take-charge kind of gal'," [...] while crowning her the [...] "main attraction of Beauty and the Beast." [...] Emma Cochrane of Empire hailed Belle as [...] "a feminist heroine who [...] more rounded than previous Disney characters", while Paste's Annlee Ellingson similarly enjoyed the character's [...] "feminist kick." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun wrote that [...] "Belle ... is no passive fairy tale princess, but a real live girl, with a spunky personality and her own private agenda." [...] TV Guide wrote that [...] "The familiar narrative is strengthened by the independent, self-assured character of Belle," [...] concluding, [...] "Unlike Disney heroines from Snow White through Ariel, Belle is smart, knows what she wants, and doesn't spend her time pining away for the love of a handsome prince." [...] Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly praised Belle's heroism, dubbing her [...] "the hero" [...] of Beauty and the Beast, while Entertainment Weekly's Christian Blauvelt opined, [...] "Unlike previous Disney heroines who needed to be rescued by a prince themselves, Belle not only saves the Beast's life, she saves his soul." [...] TLC's Vicki Arkoff received Belle as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "sharp-tongued" [...] heroine, crediting the character for [...] "break Disney's passive-princess mold." [...] About.com's David Nusair described Belle as an [...] "admirable" [...] heroine. AllMovie's Don Kaye and Perry Seibert echoed each other's reviews of the character, with Kaye describing both Belle and the Beast as [...] "three-dimensional ... complex individuals who defy stereotyping and change over the course of the story," [...] and Seibert calling Belle a [...] "strong female character" [...] who [...] "sidesteps most of the clichés surrounding Disney heroines." [...] Common Sense Media hailed Belle as [...] "one of Disney's smartest, most independent heroines." ...|$|E
