A proper depth control leads to optimize energy consumption. A four-bar mechanism was used {{in order to move}} the blade of the machine and to control the operation depth while a DC electrical motor provided the movement of the blade. The four-bar mechanism consisted of a power screw, linkage bars, moveable pin and a blade. A control system was used to follow the uneven ground surface and control the displacement of the blade by sending commands to the DC electrical motor. The tests were carried out in laboratory on artificial uneven ground in sinuous curves as well as square and triangle shapes. The displacement of the blade was recorded by a digital camera and converted to image and analyzed using Matlab software. All the tests were replicated three times. The photo sensor responded better than the capacitive sensor for all obstacle shapes...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith {{increased}} use of precision agriculture techniques, information concerning within-field crop yield variability is becoming increasingly important for effective crop management. Despite the commercial availability of yield monitors, many <b>crop</b> <b>harvesters</b> are not equipped with them. Moreover, yield monitor data can only be collected at harvest and used for after-season management. On the other hand, remote sensing imagery obtained {{during the growing season}} can be used to generate yield maps for both within-season and after-season management. This paper gives an overview on the use of airborne multispectral and hyperspectral imagery and high-resolution satellite imagery for assessing crop growth and yield variability. The methodologies for image acquisition and processing and for the integration and analysis of image and yield data are discussed. Five application examples are provided to illustrate how airborne multispectral and hyperspectral imagery and high-resolution satellite imagery have been used for mapping crop yield variability. Image processing techniques including vegetation indices, unsupervised classification, correlation and regression analysis, principal component analysis, and supervised and unsupervised linear spectral unmixing are used in these examples. Some of the advantages and limitations on the use of different types of remote sensing imagery and analysis techniques for yield mapping are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Deflection {{characteristics}} of crop (rice, wheat) stalks {{were examined in}} order to make clear the mechanical interaction between <b>crops</b> and combine <b>harvester.</b> At the beginning, flexural rigidity values (EI) of crop stalks were calculated from the results of de flection test using image processing apparatus. Further, deflection values and posture of crop stalks were predicted by analysis of Finite Element Method (FEM) using parameters of EI. Therefore, propriety of FEM analysis was examined through the comparison with measured values. Finally, in this study, the following results were obtained: 1) The deflection of crop stalks could be returned to initial condition in a moment against a light load. But, against a heavy load, it took a little time to return to initial condition. Namely, the crop stalks were indicated to have {{characteristics of}} viscous elasticity. 2) Deflection values and posture of crop stalks calculated by FEM analysis almost coincided with measured values. From this result, deflection characteristics of crop stalks will be examined theoretically by FEM analysis if EI are obtained accurately. 3) The EI of crop stalks both rice and wheat became larger gradually {{in the direction of the}} root according as cross section area of stalk became larger. 収穫作業時における作物稈に作用する機械的作用を究明するため,画像処理装置を用いて作物(稲･小麦) 稈の撓み計測,曲げ剛さ(EI) の計算並びに有限要素法による作物稈の撓み姿勢や撓み量の計算値を実測値と比較し,撓み特性について考察を行った. 得られた主な結果は次のとおりである. 1) 稲･小麦稈に軽い荷重をかけた場合は,初期状態にすぐに回復したが,荷重が大きくなるに従い回復するのに若干の時間を要する. つまり,稲･小麦稈は粘弾性,応力緩和の特性があることを示した. 2) 有限要素法による作物稈の撓み姿勢や撓み量の計算値を実測値と比較した結果,両者ともほぼ一致する傾向が認められた. このことから,曲げ剛さ(EI) の計算精度が非常に高ければ,稲･小麦稈の撓み特性は理論的に考察できることが示唆された. 3) 稲･小麦稈両者ともに根元に行くに従って,稈の断面形状は少しずつ大きくなり,曲げ剛さ(EI) もわずかなばらつきはあるものの大きくなる傾向が見られた...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{bachelor}} thesis was to perform literary research {{on the topic of}} the productivity of individual wood logging methods for forest cover and verify this productivity by comparison of the time dimensions either by using the harvester or working with the woodcutters. The main contribution of the thesis research results are own measurement. Measuring of the productivity of individual wood logging methods was carried out in the conditions given by the method cut to length by salvage cutting, that launched because of hit by bark beetle or strong wind. The measurement was carried out on five stands with harvester and on two stands with woodcutters. It was a measure of one harvester operator and four woodcutters. The measurement was done with the help of cameras that caught the working times of woodcutters and the harvester. The resulting times, due to the productivity and stem volume of the trees, recorded times by harvester were better and for that reason that method had proven to be more effective. In one of the monitored stands the effectiveness has not been demonstrated, because the operator has not logged in this forest cover enough m 3 of the wood and the work was, therefore, loss making and time consuming. By the work of the woodcutters has the efficiency and shorter working times showed in two stands, where the measurement was carried out. Their productivity has been effective there, for example, with regard to the low number of trees and the larger <b>crop</b> density, the <b>harvester</b> technology would not be efficient...|$|R
40|$|Thamnochortus insignis (Albertinia thatching reed) is a restio specie {{which is}} endemic {{in the narrow}} (20 km wide) coastal dune veld, from the Gouritz River in the east to the Breede River in the west (120 km). The area within this belt, where this reed is the {{dominant}} restio, covers 65 500 hectares. The culms of the reed is harvested as a natural product from the veld and used as thatch on roofs of houses. The traditional use has been as roofing material in Cape Dutch architecture. At this time, thatch roofs are regarded as a luxury commodity and are used in prestigious residential areas and also eco-friendly housing developments. The first section of the research project {{was based on a}} Delphi technique questionnaire completed first by 37 and secondly by 10 stakeholders in the industry. This group of growers, contract <b>harvesters,</b> <b>crop</b> agents and thatchers represented 80 percent percent of the estimated 2005 harvest and 87 percent of the estimated farm gate crop value. The thatching reed industry is the main agricultural enterprise situated in the coastal dune veld of the Southern Cape, i. e. 55 percent of total Gross Product Value generated by the survey respondents. The second section is based on an analysis of experimental harvest plots (50 m 2), selected at random (4 replications per site) in the 2 x 3 different production systems, i. e. traditional harvest from natural veld, harvest from veld which had been subjected to mechanical injury ("sleep") and harvest from established orchard-type lands. Harvest data was collected at each site in terms of the following components, i. e. number of harvestable tussocks, circumference of tussocks and number of reed bundles (minimum circumference 210 mm, minimum length 1, 2 m). The gross income per site was calculated on the basis of R 1, 80 per bundle (2006 -price level). Economic analysis (Gross Margin above selected costs) indicates that plant density (reed tussocks/ha) is a critical factor, in order to offset the establishment cost of R 2 100 /ha in established lands, which is not incurred in the other two production systems. Economic returns from the first planted lands (2 100 and 2 900 plants/ha) averaged R 7 666 /ha against R 8 781 /ha for the mechanical-injury plants. However, at a density of 5 000 plants/ha, the projected Gross Margin increases to R 15 765 /ha. The use of mechanicalinjury and natural vegetation production systems both interfere with biodiversity and raise major concerns with regard to sustainability of the sensitive coastal dune fynbos. ANOVA-analysis of the data indicates a highly significant difference (p = 0, 01) for all sites and production systems. Statistical analysis of averages indicates that mechanical injury treatment results in {{a significant increase in the}} number of tussocks, when compared to established and natural veld, respectively. The variance in the circumference of tussocks was greatest in natural veld (55 to 71 percent) and mechanical injury (54 to 61 percent). Tussocks harvested from established plantings reflected the least level of variance (28 to 38 percent). The larger reed tussocks in the established lands produced more bundles of marketable reed (8 200 /ha) than the mechanical-injury (7 625 /ha) and natural veld (3 450 /ha) respectively. Establishment of T. insignis plantlets in an "orchard" system at spacings of 2 m x 1 m on previous winter cereal lands or old pastures, is shown to meet all the requirements within a sustainable production system, i. e. viability, productivity, environmental-friendly, risk management and social acceptance. Furthermore, the quality of the yield was in line with the proposed grading standard for thatching reed, i. e. minimum circumference 210 mm, minimum length 1, 2 m and less than 6, 5 percent grey culm content...|$|R
40|$|The {{harvesting}} {{of sugar}} cane {{is the first}} stage in the commercial milling of sugar cane to produce sugar and {{plays a major role}} in determining the overall efficiency of the sugar production process. In Australia, where virtually all sugar cane is harvested using mechanical harvesters, efficient operation of the harvester is essential to reduce operating costs. One area of harvesting that has, on numerous occasions, been identified as an impediment to improved harvester efficiency is the adjustment of the base cutter height. Improper setting during harvesting has a number of serious consequences for sugar production including reduced production, <b>crop</b> damage, additional <b>harvester</b> running costs and inefficient transportation and milling of the sugar cane due to the introduction of dirt. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop a ground detection sensor based on microwave radar technology that could sense ground level in front of a working sugar cane harvester. The eventual purpose of such a device would be to automatically control the cutting height to the optimum level and thus improving the efficiency of the harvesting, farming and milling processes. The measurement technique investigated is based upon the use of a radio transmitter and receiver positioned on either side of the row of sugar cane. The principle of this design is that a receiver close to ground level would experience more attenuation from the soil than a receiver positioned well above ground level. Thus, it was suggested that changes in the received signal strength with respect to the height above ground level could be used to detect changes in the height of the ground. The project evolved in two main stages. Initially, work concentrated on verifying the sensing principle in the laboratory and later in the field. Testing verified the proposed measurement procedure with the following major conclusions. Firstly, for best results a radio signal of 2 - 3 GHz polarised horizontal to the ground was most suitable. This signal provided the best compromise between being insensitive to the presence of the sugar cane while still allowing practical sized antennas to be employed. Secondly, field-testing showed that the sugar cane stalks do affect the ideal sensor response with the orientation and condition (density, leaf matter, etc) of the sugar cane having a noticeable influence on the measurements. These results suggested that a practical sensor would need to incorporate automatic compensation for the variations in the sugar cane and that some averaging or signal processing would have to be applied to remove the underlying trends. The second stage of the project involved building a prototype sensor and testing it on a working sugar cane harvester. The prototype worked by measuring the received amplitude of a 2. 4 GHz, horizontally polarised microwave radio signal that was transmitted from one side of the sugar cane row to the other. For this application, multiple receivers are stacked vertically to measure the full height profile instantaneously. The idea of using multiple receivers with some positioned well above the ground level, was to compensate for the changing density of the sugar cane. The transmitter and receiver antennas were based on rectangular microstrip patch antenna arrays. The low profile of these patch antennas meant that they were ideal for flush mounting on the harvesters’ crop divider walls. Dedicated transmitter and receiver electronics was also needed to generate and detect the microwave radio signals used by this system. A full control system and data logger was developed for this application. The prototype sensor that was developed was trialled on an Austoft harvester over a one week period in the Burnett region. These tests were used to confirm that the sensor would work and that it could survive the harsh conditions experienced during harvesting. Overall, the aim of this thesis was to test the potential of the microwave ground height detection sensor for automated control of the base cutter height on sugar cane harvester and to develop a plan to use this technology in a commercial base cutter height control system...|$|R
