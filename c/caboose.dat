5|$|In February 2000, {{a tree in}} the Adventureland section {{fell onto}} the DRR's Holiday Red freight train while it was in motion, {{damaging}} the awnings and their supports on the gondolas as well as knocking off the cupola {{on top of the}} <b>caboose</b> before the train came to a stop.

5|$|Within {{a week of}} Disneyland's {{opening on}} July 17, 1955, a {{brakeman}} pulled the switch connecting the Disneyland Railroad's main line with a siding at Main Street, U.S.A. Station too soon as the Retlaw 2 freight train on the siding was passing the Retlaw 1 passenger train stopped at the station on the main line. The <b>caboose</b> {{on the end of}} the freight train had not made it fully across the switch when it was pulled, and as a result the caboose's front set of wheels correctly traveled along the siding while the rear set of wheels incorrectly traveled along the main line towards the passenger train, causing the <b>caboose</b> to swing to the side before colliding with a concrete slab and derailing upon impact. During the ensuing commotion, the erring brakeman, presumably to avoid disciplinary action, quietly left the scene of the accident, exited the park, and was not seen again. No injuries were reported, and by the following year the use of sidings at stations on the DRR's main line came to an end.|$|E

5|$|During the 1990s, a {{broadband}} utility {{seeking to}} lay {{fiber optic cable}} paid the town {{to pass through the}} former corridor. The town used part of its payment to pave the route and open it as a public rail trail in 1997. The creation of the trail was supported by a local Rotary club, which built a pavilion along the trail. The pavilion includes a donated antique <b>caboose.</b> While the trail originally ended at Route44–55, it was extended eastward between 2009 and 2010, intersecting Route9W and continuing to the Poughkeepsie Bridge. The extension was paid for by stimulus funding.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Michigan Central Depot, {{from which}} the area took its name, no longer stands, but it was between the northeast {{side of the tracks}} and the west side of River Street, directly across from the freighthouse, since replaced by a parking lot. The freighthouse, built in 1878, does still stand, and the area immediately around the freighthouse is home to the Depot Town Farmers' Market, one of two farmers' markets in Ypsilanti. Also in the freighthouse courtyard, a <b>caboose</b> sits parallel to Rice Street.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} before the debut of the No. 5 locomotive, the railroad, {{for the first time in}} its history, hosted a privately owned train on its track. On the morning of May 10, before Disneyland opened for the day, a private {{ceremony}} was held at New Orleans Square Station to honor Disney animator and rail enthusiast Ollie Johnston, supposedly to thank him for helping to inspire Walt Disney's passion for trains, which led to the creation of Disneyland. The true motive for having Johnston there was soon revealed when a simple steam train not part of the DRR's rolling stock, consisting of a locomotive named Marie E. and a <b>caboose,</b> rolled towards the station and stopped at its platform. Johnston, a previous owner of the steam train, used to run it on his vacation property, which he sold, along with the train, in 1993. The man who now owned the train was Pixar film director John Lasseter, who had brought the train to Disneyland in order to give Johnston, his mentor, an opportunity to reunite with and drive his former locomotive. Johnston, then in his nineties, was helped into the Marie E., and with Lasseter at his side, he grasped the locomotive's throttle and drove his former possession three times around the DRR's main line. Although Johnston died in 2008, Lasseter continues to run the Marie E., the <b>caboose,</b> and an assortment of train cars on his private Justi Creek Railway, which is complemented by the depot building and water tower from Ward Kimball's former Grizzly Flats Railroad.|$|E
5000|$|The classic {{idea of the}} [...] "little red caboose" [...] at the end {{of every}} train came about when <b>cabooses</b> were painted a reddish brown; however, some railroads (UP, and NKP, for example) painted their <b>cabooses</b> yellow or red and white. The most notable was the Santa Fe which in the 1960s started a rebuild program for their <b>cabooses</b> in which the cars were painted bright red with an eight-foot-diameter Santa Fe cross herald emblazoned on each side in yellow. Some railroads, chiefly the Wabash Railway, Norfolk and Western and Illinois Central Gulf, also built or {{upgraded}} <b>cabooses</b> with streamlined cupolas for better aerodynamics and to project a more modern image.|$|R

5|$|On 19 November 1940, a {{train with}} workers from Trondheim {{to the airport}} {{collided}} with the local train from Kopperå just east of Hommelvik Station. The Hommelvik train disaster killed 22 people. The trains {{were supposed to have}} passed at Homnmelvik Station, but the engineer thought he had seen the other train, and had left the station. The accident occurred at 08:03, and was caused by there being virtually no light to see with, since all outdoor sources of light were covered. On 23 January 1941, a coke and coal train from Sweden lost its braking between the border and Kopperå. The six back cars plus the <b>caboose</b> derailed just west of Kopperå Station, while the locomotive and 17 other trains continued their wild flight. The train derailed at Meråker Station, and the Meråker train disaster killed both the engineer and the stoker.|$|E
5|$|The station {{house was}} built in 1869 (and opened on September 9, 1869) by the Hackensack and New York Railroad on a track {{extension}} from Passaic Street in Hackensack. The station {{was turned over to}} the Erie Railroad in 1896 and New Jersey Transit in 1983. The next year, the station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The station building, which was 139 years old, was destroyed in a three-alarm fire and explosion at 5:55a.m. on January 10, 2009. At the time the station house was the second-oldest (active service) in New Jersey (second to Ramsey's Main Street station). The station building was also the site for the Green <b>Caboose</b> Thrift Shop, a charity gift shop maintained by a branch of the Hackensack University Medical Center from 1962 until the station depot burned in 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{culmination}} of Thor missile training was {{to participate in}} a missile launch. Originally it was intended that all Thor missile crews would carry out at least one launch, but it soon became apparent that the cost would be prohibitive. Nonetheless, 21 RAF crews visited the United States for training, culminating in operational training launches from Vandenberg. This was known as Integrated Weapons System Training (IWST). The first of these launches was a launch codenamed Lions Roar. Despite the fact that a Thor missile had exploded on the launch pad just a few days before, the launch was viewed by dignitaries including Brigadier Godfrey Hobbs, the Director of Public Relations at the Ministry of Defence; Air Vice-Marshal Walter Sheen, the RAF commander at the British Joint Staff Mission; and Air Vice-Marshal Augustus Walker, the commander of No. 1 Group. After delays due to weather and technical problems, the missile was successfully launched on 16 April 1959. In all, there were nine IWST launches, the last of which, codenamed Red <b>Caboose,</b> was on 21 January 1960.|$|E
50|$|The {{name was}} also {{used to refer to}} some <b>cabooses.</b> Described in IC 9650-9956, these were steel {{underframe}} drover's <b>cabooses</b> built between 1897 and 1913, and reclassified as banana messengers sometime between 1955 and 1963.

5|$|Through WED Enterprises, {{a legally}} {{separate}} entity from Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney retained personal {{ownership of the}} DRR and financed the creation of two trains to run on it in time for Disneyland's opening day. The names of both trains contained the word Retlaw, which is Walter spelled backwards. The first train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 1, would be pulled by the No. 2 locomotive, which was given a turn-of-the-20th century appearance with a straight smokestack (typical of coal-burning locomotives), a circular headlamp, and a small cowcatcher. The No. 2 locomotive would pull six 1890s-style passenger cars designed by Bob Gurr, consisting of a combine car, four coaches, and an observation coach. The second train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 2, would be pulled by the No. 1 locomotive, which was given a late-19th century appearance with a spark-arresting diamond smokestack (typical of wood-burning locomotives), a rectangular headlamp, and a large cowcatcher. The No. 1 locomotive would pull six freight cars consisting of three cattle cars, two gondolas, and a <b>caboose.</b> Walt Disney Studios built the train cars {{and most of the}} parts for the locomotives; Dixon Boiler Works built the locomotive boilers, and Wilmington Iron Works built the locomotive frames. Both locomotives were designed to run on diesel oil to generate steam. Final assembly of the locomotives and their tenders took place at the Disneyland site in the DRR's new roundhouse, which was built in one week by a construction crew directed by Park Construction Administrator Joe Fowler, a former US Navy rear admiral. The two original DRR trains cost over $240,000 to build, with the two locomotives costing over $40,000 each.|$|E
25|$|A {{transfer}} <b>caboose</b> {{looks more}} like a flat car with a shed bolted to the middle of it than it does a standard <b>caboose.</b> It is used in transfer service between rail yards or short switching runs, and as such, lacks sleeping, cooking or restroom facilities.

25|$|The {{rest of the}} CPRR's {{rolling stock}} {{consisted}} of six cast-metal, wood-grain-patterned gondolas made by the studio's machine shop; and two boxcars, two stock cars, a flatcar, and a <b>caboose</b> made of wood from the studio's prop shop. Disney's fascination with miniature models was apparent {{with the level of}} detail he applied to the miniature interior of the <b>caboose,</b> which included a calendar hung on the wall, a broom, and a working potbelly stove. Except for its frame and trucks, Disney built the entire <b>caboose</b> himself. All of the train cars except for the <b>caboose,</b> when not in use, were stored in the CPRR's tunnel.|$|E

25|$|In a {{bay window}} <b>caboose,</b> the crew {{monitoring}} the train {{sits in the}} middle of the car in a section of wall that projects from the side of the <b>caboose.</b> The windows set into these extended walls resemble architectural bay windows, so the <b>caboose</b> type is called a bay window <b>caboose.</b> This type afforded a better view of the side of the train and eliminated the falling hazard of the cupola. It is thought to have first been used on the Akron, Canton and Youngstown Railroad in 1923, but is particularly associated with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which built all of its cabooses in this design starting from an experimental model in 1930. The bay window gained favor with many railroads because it eliminated the need for additional clearances in tunnels and overpasses.|$|E

They also inspected the train for problems such as shifting loads, broken or dragging equipment, and hot boxes (overheated axle bearings, a serious fire and derailment threat). The conductor kept records and handled business from a table or desk in the <b>caboose.</b> For longer trips, the <b>caboose</b> provided minimal living quarters, and was frequently personalized and decorated with pictures and posters.|$|E
