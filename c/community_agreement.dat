5|$|The {{aim of the}} {{operation}} was to facilitate the withdrawal of PLAN combatants. South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha confined all South African troops to their base for 60 hours, allowing SWAPO guerillas {{to leave the country}} unhindered. Nine assembly points were established by the UN, with up to twelve soldiers and five military observers at each. Six of the assembly points (APs) were led by Australians: Captain Richard Bradshaw (contingent signals officer) at AP Charlie (Ruacana), Sergeant Kerry Ponting (Squadron workshop) at AP Foxtrot (Oshikango), Captain Mark Hender (Squadron Operations Officer) at AP Juliet (Okankolo), Lieutenant Stephen Alexander (Field troop commander) at AP Delta (Beacon 7, west of Oshikango), Lieutenant Mark Broome (Plant Troop Officer) AP Bravo (Ruacana) and Lieutenant Pat Sowry (Liaison Officer) AP Kilo (Oshikuku). Most of the assembly points had intense media scrutiny. The intention of {{the operation}} was for PLAN combatants to assemble at these points. They would then be escorted across the border north to the 16th parallel to their bases of confinement, but the operation was unsuccessful. Very few PLAN combatants passed through these points; for the most part, they withdrew across the border by walking independently. It was estimated that 200 to 400 PLAN members remained in Namibia, absorbed into the local <b>community.</b> <b>Agreement</b> was subsequently reached in late April that the SADF personnel be restricted to their bases from 26 April; in effect, hostilities ended after that date.|$|E

40|$|Defense date: 18 / 06 / 2009 Examining board: Gráinne de Búrca (former EUI, now Fordham University - supervisor), Marise Cremona (EUI), Pieter-Jan Kuijper (University of Amsterdam), Marc Maresceau (University of Ghent) This thesis {{assesses the}} legal effect of <b>Community</b> <b>Agreements,</b> {{explored}} through the case-law of the Community courts. It places this issue within the broader {{setting of the}} legal effect of treaties in domestic legal orders and how {{we think about the}} role of domestic courts in treaty enforcement. It proposes a basic dichotomy between automatic and non-automatic treaty incorporation in preference to the commonly employed, but analytically unhelpful, language of monism and dualism. And it emphasises the need for greater empirical work as to how courts in automatic treaty incorporation states actually deal with treaties when they are invoked; rather than relying on the untested assumption that the particular phrasing of a constitutional provision providing the port of entry for treaties into the domestic legal arena and/or seminal judicial assertions on their legal effect is matched by existing judicial practice. To this end, a data-set of the existing <b>Community</b> <b>Agreements</b> jurisprudence of the Community Courts was created. It is an assessment of this data-set that provides the core empirical work of this study. This study illustrates how the foundational <b>Community</b> <b>Agreements</b> jurisprudence signalled an attachment to an automatic treaty incorporation model and thus erected a central plank of the Community's external relations constitution with profound constitutional ramifications for the Member States. This constitutes a neglected dimension of the constitutionalisation debate, namely, the constitutionalising effect of Community law upon <b>Community</b> <b>Agreements.</b> The data however indicates that there is evidence of a twin-track judicial approach to <b>Community</b> <b>Agreements</b> emerging. The first, where domestic action of the Member States is being challenged, appears to manifest the unleashing of a full treaty enforcement model. In contrast, there are indications of a judicial willingness to shield Community action from review vis-àvis <b>Community</b> <b>Agreements</b> which has significant implications for the EU's commitment to international law...|$|R

2500|$|While free {{movement}} of workers was central to the first European Economic <b>Community</b> <b>agreement,</b> the development of European labour law has been a gradual process. Originally, the Ohlin Report of 1956 recommended that labour standards {{did not need to}} be harmonised, although a general principle of anti-discrimination between men and women was included in the early Treaties. Increasingly, the absence of labour rights was seen as inadequate given the capacity for a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] in international trade if corporations can shift jobs and production to countries with low wages. Today, the EU is required under TFEU article 147 to contribute to a [...] "high level of employment by encouraging cooperation between Member States". This has not resulted in legislation, which usually requires taxation and fiscal stimulus for significant change, while the European Central Bank's monetary policy has been acutely controversial during the Eurozone crisis. Under article 153(1), the EU is able to use the ordinary legislation procedure on a list of labour law fields. This notably excludes wage regulation and collective bargaining. Generally, four main fields of EU regulation of labour rights touch (1) individual labour rights, (2) anti-discrimination regulations, (3) rights to information, consultation, and participation at work, and (4) rights to job security. In virtually all cases, the EU follows the principle that member states can always create rights more beneficial to workers. This is because the fundamental principle of labour law is that employees' unequal bargaining power justifies substitution of rules in property and contract with positive social rights so that people may earn a living to fully participate in a democratic society. The EU's competences generally follow principles codified in the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers 1989, introduced in the [...] "social chapter" [...] of the Treaty of Maastricht. Initially the UK had opted-out, because of opposition by the Conservative Party, but was acceded to when the Labour Party won the 1997 general election in the Treaty of Amsterdam.|$|E

Second, this Article will then review the facts and the holding of In re Estate of Lyman, an appeals court case illustrating the typical fact situation and setting forth the approach of the Washington Supreme Court in this area. It remains the best and most instructive example to date of this issue. Third, the Article will discuss the general contract law concept of implying an omitted contract term when it appears that policy and efficiency dictate that such a term be implied. Fourth, the Article will suggest implying a term of termination in <b>community</b> property <b>agreements</b> upon permanent separation, analogizing to the law of acquisitions while living separate and apart. Finally, the Article explores the policy benefits of implying such a term in <b>community</b> property <b>agreements.</b> The treatment the law gives to property acquisitions by spouses while living separate and apart provides the basic policy support for the implication of an omitted term in <b>community</b> property <b>agreements.</b> Since that policy likely reflects what most permanently separated spouses would want, it is also likely to reflect the intent of most spouses with respect to the validity of <b>community</b> property <b>agreements</b> during permanent separation. Therefore, this Article concludes that a term should be implied in each <b>community</b> property <b>agreement</b> terminating such agreements upon a permanent separation...|$|R
