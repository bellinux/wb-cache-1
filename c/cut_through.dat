5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar ice cap several times. As the ice moved it eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the rivers have <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> the gravel and flow swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the rivers and formed rapids.|$|E
5|$|From Lincoln, {{the river}} again turns first east, then south, making a <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> an belt of upland {{known as the}} Lincoln Gap. This section is again {{believed}} to have been a lower course of the Trent during and before periods of glaciation.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of Loughor Castle {{and the surrounding}} town declined in the late-medieval period, and by the 19th century the castle had been ruined {{for many years and}} was covered in ivy. The castle was painted by the artist William Butler in the 1850s, who depicted the ruins alongside the local industries and the new railway line that had been <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> the remains of the former Roman fort.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of the Sirex {{woodwasp}} {{are almost}} colourless and only have three stub-shaped pairs of sterna. They <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> host wood with their powerful mandibles. They have a pointed, dark tip at their rear end, which presses the drilling {{dust on the}} walls of the borehole. They closely resemble other larvae in the genus Sirex.|$|E
5|$|The plateau is {{dominated}} by hard chert bands of Upper Greensand with some remnants of chalk, and is <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> by river valleys. The hills support an extensive range of wildlife leading to the designation of 16Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs).|$|E

5|$|The ruins {{consist of}} 15 groups {{containing}} {{the remains of}} over 120 major structures, including temples, palaces, and courts for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame. When the site was excavated, the surface {{was found to be}} littered with abundant obsidian blades and arrowheads. Originally the city had its main entrance on the western side, a modern road has now been <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> to the ruins from the west along a similar route.|$|E

5|$|After {{the episode}} was submitted, several re-writes were requested. Originally, {{the story was}} {{supposed}} to take place in Oklahoma, noted for being the center of Tornado Alley. For budgetary reasons, the episode was relocated to Mississippi. Another scene, originally scripted to take place at a motel, featured Pinker taking a short <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> a wall. This scene was cut not only because of budgetary reasons, but also because the writers and producers wanted to shift the episode from a supernatural focus to an emotional one.|$|E

5|$|Bristol {{is part of}} a {{limestone}} area {{running from}} the Mendip Hills in the south to the Cotswolds in the northeast. The rivers Avon and Frome <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> the limestone to the underlying clay, creating Bristol's characteristically hilly landscape. The Avon flows from Bath in the east, through flood plains and areas which were marshes before the city's growth. To the west the Avon cuts through the limestone to form the Avon Gorge, aided by glacial meltwater after the last ice age.|$|E
5|$|Dr Sadiq Alekry, a 44-year-old plastic surgeon, voluntarily {{offered his}} {{services}} at the roundabout {{on the evening of}} 16February, shortly after he had returned from Houston. According to Human rights watch, Alekry along with other staff were wearing special medical jackets showing the Red Crescent. During the raid, riot police attacked his tent and <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> it; despite telling them he was a physician, police handcuffed him from his back and a number of security officers repeatedly punched, kicked and hit him with sticks on his head {{and other parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|During the Song Dynasty, Beiyue Temple {{was used}} as an {{alternate}} site to make sacrifices to the Northern Peak, Mount Heng, one of the sacred mountains of Daoism. During this time, Mount Heng was controlled by the Liao Dynasty (916-1125). In order to maintain political legitimacy and receive Daoist support, Beiyue Temple was chosen by the Song Emperor as the location to make sacrifices to Hengshan. Even though the mountain was not controlled by the Song, they believed that a 'geomantic vein' that would direct their sacrifices could be <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> enemy-controlled territory and reach it.|$|E

5|$|In 1838, a {{man named}} Mr. Butler {{requested}} permission of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to construct a tunnel or through <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> Nescopeck Mountain for the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Glen Summit Springs Hotel operated on top of Nescopeck Mountain. It was constructed by the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. During its most active use, it attracted visitors from the Wyoming Valley and from the East Coast of the United States. The Lehigh Valley Railroad historically passed over the ridge. In the late 1800s, the ridge was prospected for coal.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, a {{study on}} {{improving}} the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel by either building another tube or by constructing a bypass was carried out. Based on the study, the turnpike commission planned to replace the deteriorating tunnel with a <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> the mountain. The plans were put on hold in 2001 because it would cost $93.7 million. It resurrected the project in 2009. The nearby Mountain Field and Stream Club prefers that the tunnels are improved or a new tube is built rather than building the bypass. These improvements are needed because the Allegheny Mountain Tunnel is narrow and deteriorating, with disintegrating ceiling slabs and outdated lighting and ventilation.|$|E

Fire on the aircraft's left was spotted. The #1 engine {{was shut down}} and its fire extinguisher was activated. The accident investigation determined that the engine had suffered catastrophic failure, engine blades had <b>cut</b> <b>through</b> the engine mounts and the engine became detached from the aircraft.|$|E
