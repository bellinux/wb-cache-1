50|$|In {{ophthalmology}} and optometry, {{the instrument}} {{is called a}} “slit lamp,” although it is more correctly called a “slit lamp instrument”. Today’s instrument {{is a combination of}} two separate developments, the <b>corneal</b> <b>microscope</b> and the slit lamp itself. The first concept of a slit lamp dates back to 1911 credited to Alvar Gullstrand and his “large reflection-free ophthalmoscope.” The instrument was manufactured by Zeiss and consisted of a special illuminator connected to a small stand base through a vertical adjustable column. The base was able to move freely on a glass plate. The illuminator employed a Nernst glower which was later converted into a slit through a simple optical system. However, the instrument never received much attention and the term “slit lamp” did not appear in any literature again until 1914.|$|E
40|$|Acanthamoeba {{keratitis}} is {{a serious}} pathogenic corneal disease, with challenging diagnosis. Standard diagnostic methods include corneal biopsy (involving cell culture) and in vivo reflection corneal microscopy (in which the visualization of the pathogen is challenged {{by the presence of}} multiple reflectance corneal structures). We present a new imaging method based on fluorescence sectioned microscopy for visualization of Acanthamoeba. A fluorescent marker (MT- 11 -BDP), composed by a fluorescent group (BODIPY) inserted in miltefosine (a therapeutic agent against Acanthamoeba), was developed. A custom-developed fluorescent structured illumination sectioned <b>corneal</b> <b>microscope</b> (excitation wavelength: 488 nm; axial/lateral resolution: 2. 6 μm/ 0. 4 - 0. 6 μm) was used to image intact enucleated rabbit eyes, injected with a solution of stained Acanthamoeba in the stroma. Fluorescent sectioned microscopic images of intact enucleated rabbit eyes revealed stained Acanthamoeba trophozoites within the stroma, easily identified by the contrasted fluorescent emission, size and shape. Control experiments show that the fluorescent maker is not internalized by corneal cells, making the developed marker specific to the pathogen. Fluorescent sectioned microscopy shows potential for specific diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis. Corneal confocal microscopy, provided with a fluorescent channel, could be largely improved in specificity and sensitivity in combination with specific fluorescent marking. © 2012 Optical Society of America.

40|$|YesDiabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common types of {{diabetes}} that can affect the cornea. An accurate analysis of the nerve structures can assist the early diagnosis of this disease. This paper proposes a robust, fast and fully automatic nerve segmentation and morphometric parameter quantification system for <b>corneal</b> confocal <b>microscope</b> images. The segmentation part consists of three main steps. First, a preprocessing step is applied to enhance the visibility of the nerves and remove noise using anisotropic diffusion filtering, specifically a Coherence filter followed by Gaussian filtering. Second, morphological operations are applied to remove unwanted objects in the input image such as epithelial cells and small nerve segments. Finally, an edge detection step is applied to detect all the nerves in the input image. In this step, an efficient algorithm for connecting discontinuous nerves is proposed. In the morphometric parameters quantification part, a number of features are extracted, including thickness, tortuosity and length of nerve, which may be used for the early diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy and when planning Laser-Assisted in situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) or Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). The performance of the proposed segmentation system is evaluated against manually traced ground-truth images based on a database consisting of 498 corneal sub-basal nerve images (238 are normal and 260 are abnormal). In addition, the robustness and efficiency of the proposed system in extracting morphometric features with clinical utility was evaluated in 919 images taken from healthy subjects and diabetic patients with and without neuropathy. We demonstrate rapid (13 seconds/image), robust and effective automated corneal nerve quantification. The proposed system will be deployed as a useful clinical tool to support the expertise of ophthalmologists and save the clinician time in a busy clinical setting.

40|$|OBJECTIVE Corneal {{confocal}} microscopy {{is a novel}} {{diagnostic technique}} {{for the detection of}} nerve damage and repair in a range of peripheral neuropathies, in particular diabetic neuropathy. Normative reference values are required to enable clinical translation and wider use of this technique. We have therefore undertaken a multicenter collaboration to provide worldwide age-adjusted normative values of corneal nerve fiber parameters. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 1, 965 corneal nerve images from 343 healthy volunteers were pooled from six clinical academic centers. All subjects underwent examination with the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph <b>corneal</b> confocal <b>microscope.</b> Images of the central corneal subbasal nerve plexus were acquired by each center using a standard protocol and analyzed by three trained examiners using manual tracing and semiautomated software (CCMetrics). Age trends were established using simple linear regression, and normative corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve fiber branch density (CNBD), corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL), and corneal nerve fiber tortuosity (CNFT) reference values were calculated using quantile regression analysis. RESULTS There was a significant linear age-dependent decrease in CNFD (- 0. 164 no. /mm(2) per year for men, P < 0. 01, and - 0. 161 no. /mm(2) per year for women, P < 0. 01). There was no change with age in CNBD (0. 192 no. /mm(2) per year for men, P = 0. 26, and - 0. 050 no. /mm(2) per year for women, P = 0. 78). CNFL decreased in men (- 0. 045 mm/mm(2) per year, P = 0. 07) and women (- 0. 060 mm/mm(2) per year, P = 0. 02). CNFT increased with age in men (0. 044 per year, P < 0. 01) and women (0. 046 per year, P < 0. 01). Height, weight, and BMI did not influence the 5 th percentile normative values for any corneal nerve parameter.

40|$|Angiogenesis is the {{emergence}} of new blood and lymph vessels from existing ones. In the pathologic form it contributes to the onset and progression of numerous different human disorders such as cancer, inflammation, atherosclerosis and blinding eye diseases. There exist a number of models to study angiogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo, but there is no single perfect model so far. Consequently {{there is a need to}} develop new angiogenesis assays for evaluating blood and lymph vessel behaviour in different physiologic settings. The aim of this thesis was to gain insight into in vivo angiogenesis introducing a new technique in an inflammatory corneal model. The method involved in vivo examination of the cornea and subsequent comparison of in vivo findings with ex vivo immunohistochemical analysis of the same tissue samples. An existing suture model for inflammatory angiogenesis in the cornea was modified for in vivo observations with a clinically-approved <b>corneal</b> confocal <b>microscope.</b> In this thesis, corneal lymph vessels were characterized for the first time in vivo and findings from the experimental bench could be applied in a clinical setting, where presumed lymphatics were observed in a corneal transplant patient with rejection. Furthermore, the technique was extended to investigate time-lapse processes in sprouting and regressing capillaries, and led to a number of new observations. CD 11 b+ myeloid cells constitute the first bulk of infiltrating inflammatory cells and contribute to inflammatory sprouting and regression in numerous ways including pre-patterning of the corneal stroma and guiding of capillary sprouts. Newly formed hemangiogenic sprouts are perfused with a slow-moving fluid and have a lumen. In blood vessel regression, capillary remodeling occurred by abandonment of sprout tips in close association with macrophages and vascular loops formed by presumed intussusceptive angiogenesis. In addition, a network of pericyte- and endothelium-free basement membrane tubes was formed after desertion or degradation of vascular endothelium in former corneal capillaries. In conclusion, we introduce a new in vivo technique for investigating angiogenesis in a corneal model were in vivo findings can be interpreted with ex vivo definitions of specific cell types by immunohistochemistry. Findings from pre-clinical experiments have been possible to apply in a clinical setting when examining patients with corneal pathology...|$|R

MethodsConfocal images of 48 eyes of 35 patients with LSCD {{collected by the}} Heidelberg Retina Tomograph III Rostock <b>Corneal</b> Module Confocal <b>Microscope</b> from 2010 to 2014 were analyzed. Volume Z-scans of the central cornea and the superior, nasal, inferior, and temporal limbus {{were included in the}} analysis. Eleven normal eyes served as control. Epithelial thickness in all locations was measured by 2 independent observers. ResultsThe mean epithelial layer thickness was 48. 6 ± 2. 3  μm in the central cornea and 63. 7 ± 11. 3  μm in the limbus in the control. Compared with the epithelial thickness in normal control, the epithelial thickness in LSCD patients was reduced by an average of 20. 2 % in the central cornea and 38. 5 % in the limbus (all P <. 05). The mean corneal epithelial thickness in patients with LSCD reduced 7. 6 %, 20. 8 %, and 61. 3 % in the early, intermediate, and late stage, respectively, compared to the control. In the limbus, the overall epithelial thickness decreased 30. 0 %, 39. 7 %, and 62. 8 % in the early, intermediate, and late stage of LSCD, respectively (all P <. 05). Epithelial thinning correlated with the severity of LSCD in both cornea and limbus.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} age related variations in anterior ocular characteristics and their effect on the response to short-term (one-hour) open eye orthokeratology (OK) lens wear and overnight hydrogel lens wear. Sixty-three volunteer subjects were divided into three groups comprising children (Group I), young adults (Group II) and older adults (Group III). Anterior ocular characteristics that were measured included corneal topography with the Medmont corneal topographer, total, stromal and epithelial thickness with the Holden-Payor optical pachometer, microscopic cell characteristics with the confocal <b>microscope,</b> <b>corneal</b> aesthesiometry, corneal modulus of elasticity, and tear film, palpebral and eyelid characteristics. The older cornea {{was found to be}} more spherical in shape (asphericity Q = - 0. 24 ± 0. 07 in group III compared to - 0. 34 ± 0. 09 and - 0. 32 ± 0. 17 in groups I and II respectively) and showed a tendency from with-the-rule to against-the-rule astigmatism. Older subjects also had a decreased endothelial cell density (2596 ± 111 cells/mm 2 in group III compared to 2793 ± 138 cells/mm 2 in group II) and reduced eyelid tension compared to the younger groups. Children were found to have lower blink rates than adults. It was concluded that these changes might {{have a significant impact on}} contact lens wear. The responses to two contact lens based techniques, orthokeratology (OK) and hydrogel overnight wear (ON), were studied. Sixty subjects (20 per group) wore reverse-geometry lenses (BE, Ultravison Aust Pty Ltd) of Boston XO material in one eye under open eye conditions for one hour in one eye only. Changes in unaided visual acuity, corneal curvature, corneal thickness and confocal microscopic variables were measured after OK lens wear. All subject groups showed statistically significant improvements (p < 0. 05) in unaided visual acuity, a trend for more positive (less prolate) corneal asphericity, increase in apical corneal radius and decrease in central total corneal thickness, after OK lens wear. When the groups were stratified, statistical significance was obtained between the older group and the other two younger groups for change in apical corneal radius (0. 23 ± 0. 01 mm in group I, 0. 15 ± 0. 01 mm for group II, 0. 06 ± 0. 33 for group III). The change in asphericity also showed significant differences between the older age group (0. 10 ± 0. 08 mm) and the young adult group (0. 21 ± 0. 13). Central corneal thinning obtained after one hour of OK lens wear revealed significant differences between the older adult group (- 1. 9 ± 3. 2 &# 956;m) and the other two groups (- 5. 0 ± 5. 9 &# 956;m in group I, - 5. 0 ± 2. 0 &# 956;m for group II). Sixty subjects wore hydrogel lenses (One-Day Acuvue, Johnson and Johnson Visioncare Pty Ltd) made of etafilcon A in one eye only overnight during sleep at their home. Changes in unaided visual acuity, corneal curvature, corneal thickness, confocal microscopic variables and slitlamp variables were measured after ON lens wear. All subjects showed significant thickening (p < 0. 05) of the cornea with ON wear, more in the lens-wearing eye. This study reported that the edema response induced by Acuvue contact lenses is stromal in origin. The edema response of the older group (33. 9 ± 11. 5 &# 956;m) was lower than the other two groups as demonstrated by the difference in the change in central stromal thickness (49. 3 ± 20. 3 &# 956;m for group I and 51. 0 ± 20. 0 &# 956;m for group II). However, a statistically significant difference in the change in thickness was not reached either for the central total corneal thickness or for other topographic locations. Corneal and visual changes found in this study confirm previous reports of the effects of short term OK and hydrogel ON lens wear. Older lens wearers showed a reduced or delayed response to short-term lens wear. Studies investigating the effects of age with long lens-wearing durations are warranted to quantify these effects further...|$|R
