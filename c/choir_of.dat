5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the <b>choir</b> <b>of</b> the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in the <b>choir</b> <b>of</b> York.|$|E

50|$|Cristofori's oval spinets {{have two}} <b>choirs</b> <b>of</b> strings, each at 8-foot (normal) pitch. In the pairs of strings {{seen in the}} diagram above, each pair {{consists}} of one string from each <b>choir.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> having two <b>choirs</b> was evidently twofold. First, when both strings are played at once, a louder sound is obtained. Second, the two <b>choirs</b> <b>of</b> strings have different timbres, so contrasting tone qualities {{can be obtained by}} selecting just one choir.|$|R
5|$|As these laudes {{were to be}} {{performed}} with a very limited accompaniment of instruments, they were supposedly performed from the small loft in the high <b>choir</b> <b>of</b> the Thomaskirche, opposite to the large organ loft where the other movements of the Magnificat were performed. The autograph of the E-flat major version of the Magnificat (BWV 243a) suggests that Bach intended to perform {{the first version of}} his Magnificat also without the laudes, depending on circumstances, for example on other feasts than Christmas.|$|E

5|$|Most of the convents of {{the town}} have disappeared; the Dominican convent {{is the only one}} to have {{retained}} much of its original appearance.
