40|$|Methods for {{optimizing}} <b>coded</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> {{in clinical}} systems are a frequent topic of system design. We {{have developed a}} new mechanism {{for this type of}} data entry that we call "Pick From Thousands" (PFT). It combines several known methods, including menu selection, keyword entry, and initial character matching, but adds a new string matching algorithm. The PFT method is more selective than initial character matching for a given number of keystrokes if entries in the coded list have more than one word. Collaborative processing between a PC workstation and the central HELP system computer is used to optimize ease of maintenance and increase the flexibility and performance of the system...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is a lack}} {{of tools}} to {{evaluate}} and compare Electronic patient record (EPR) systems to inform a rational choice or development agenda. OBJECTIVE: To develop a tool kit to measure the impact of different EPR system features on the consultation. METHODS: We first developed a specification to overcome the limitations of existing methods. We divided this into work packages: (1) developing a method to display multichannel video of the consultation; (2) code and measure activities, including computer use and verbal interactions; (3) automate the capture of nonverbal interactions; (4) aggregate multiple observations into a single navigable output; and (5) produce an output interpretable by software developers. We piloted this method by filming live consultations (n = 22) by 4 general practitioners (GPs) using different EPR systems. We compared the time taken and variations during <b>coded</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry,</b> prescribing, and blood pressure (BP) recording. We used nonparametric tests to make statistical comparisons. We contrasted methods of BP recording using Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagrams. RESULTS: We found that 4 channels of video were optimal. We identified an existing application for manual coding of video output. We developed in-house tools for capturing use of keyboard and mouse and to time stamp speech. The transcript is then typed within this time stamp. Although we managed to capture body language using pattern recognition software, we were unable to use this data quantitatively. We loaded these observational outputs into our aggregation tool, which allows simultaneous navigation and viewing of multiple files. This also creates a single exportable file in XML format, which we used to develop UML sequence diagrams. In our pilot, the GP using the EMIS LV (Egton Medical Information Systems Limited, Leeds, UK) system took the longest time to code data (mean 11. 5 s, 95...|$|E
40|$|Background UK general {{practitioners}} largely conduct computer-mediated consultations. Although historically {{there were}} many small general practice (GP) computer suppliers there are now around five widely used electronic patient record (EPR) systems. A new method has been developed for assessing {{the impact of the}} computer on doctor_patient interaction through detailed observation of the consultation and computer use. Objective To pilot the latest version of a method to measure the difference in coding and prescribing times on two different brands of general practice EPR system. Method We compared two GP EPR systems by observing use in real life consultations. Three video cameras recorded the consultation and screen capture software recorded computer activity. We piloted semi-automated user action recording (UAR) software to record mouse and keyboard use, to overcome limitations in manual measurement. Six trained raters analysed the videos using data capture software to measure the doctor_patient_computer interactions; we used interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure reliability. Results Raters demonstrated high inter-rater reliability for verbal interactions and prescribing (ICC 0. 74 to 0. 99), but for measures of computer use they were not reliable. We used UAR to capture computer use and found it more reliable. <b>Coded</b> <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> time varied between the systems: 6. 8 compared with 11. 5 seconds (P = 0. 006). However, the EPR with the shortest coding time had a longer prescribing time: 27. 5 compared with 23. 7 seconds (P = 0. 64). Conclusion This methodological development improves the reliability of our method for measuring the impact of different computer systems on the GP consultation. UAR added more objectivity to the observationof doctor_computer interactions. If larger studies were to reproduce the differences between computer systems demonstrated in this pilot {{it might be possible to}} make objective comparisons between systems...|$|E

The current research proposes a formal semantic representation of CDA entries and investigates how expressive domain ontologies in OWL and SPARQL SELECT queries can contribute to NLG.

Like troublesome âguests â at a family gathering, missing data are a nuisance; they impose themselves on research designs and undermine the methodological assumptions of an analysis plan. The primary problems associated with missing data are the threats that they pose to a studyâs internal validity (primarily issues of statistical power) and external validity (being able to generalize results to a target population). Even when investigators employ appropriate strategies for coping with missing data, different approaches may lead to substantially different conclusions (Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken, 2003). In this chapter we focus on one type of missing data â item non-response.

As part of that programme we considered how primary care might contribute relevant data. METHODS: Using a questionnaire distributed to personal contacts and health authorities, we investigated the activities of sentinel practice networks and sought opinions on the place of primary care as a provider of information on health indicators. Studies on the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and on the incidence of chickenpox were undertaken within selected networks. RESULTS: 33 networks were found who provided relevant information on a timely and continuing basis.

40|$|Introduction: Use of {{electronic}} health record (EHR) systems can place a considerable <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> burden upon {{the emergency department}} (ED) physician. Voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> has been proposed as one mechanism to mitigate some of this burden; however, no reports are available specifically comparing emergency physician (EP) time use or number of interruptions between typed and voice recognition data entry-based EHRs. We designed this study to compare physician time use and interruptions between an EHR system using typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> versus an EHR with voice recognition. Methods: We collected prospective observational data at 2 academic teaching hospital EDs, one using an EHR with typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> {{and the other with}} voice recognition capabilities. Independent raters observed EP activities during regular shifts. Tasks each physician performed were noted and logged in 30 second intervals. We compared time allocated to charting, direct patient care, and change in tasks leading to interruptions between sites. Results: We logged 4, 140 minutes of observation for this study. We detected no statistically significant differences in the time spent by EPs charting (29. 4 % typed; 27. 5 % voice) or the time allocated to direct patient care (30. 7 %; 30. 8 %). Significantly more interruptions per hour were seen with typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> versus voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (5. 33 vs. 3. 47; p= 0. 0165). Conclusion: The use of a voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> system versus typed <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> did not appear to alter the amount of time physicians spend charting or performing direct patient care in an ED setting. However, we did observe a lower number of workflow interruptions with the voice recognition <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> EHR.
