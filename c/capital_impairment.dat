A lawsuit filed by SBA revealed Avalon had little or no outside capital left due to divestiture by investors, losses in revenue or asset values or a combination of the three. Avalon Equity Fund is in receivership with SBA, which will allow SBA to sell off its assets to satisfy the loans.|$|E
40|$|The 1970 Amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act have {{empowered}} the Federal Reserve Board {{to determine}} whether the bank holding company expansions into nonbank activities meet the "proper incident" test. This paper presents an analytical device whereby regulators applying this test can evaluate the effects that each proposed nonbank expansion has upon the holding company's probability of <b>capital</b> <b>impairment</b> and debt capacity. Several regulatory implications are derived. The procedure is simulated and the separate effects of diversification and debt financing are measured. While the holding companies studied diversified effectively, the benefits were largely thwarted by considerable debt financing. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{many young}} people, social {{networks}} are {{an essential part}} of their student experience. Using a Foucauldian perspective, this qualitative study explores the networked experiences of disabled students to examine how dis/ability difference is ascribed and negotiated within social networks. Data comprises 34 internet-enabled interviews with 18 participants from three English universities. Accessible field methods recognise participant preferences and circumstances. Data is analysed using discourse analysis, with an attention to context framed by activity theory. Disabled students’ networked experiences are found to be complex and diverse. For a proportion, the network shifts the boundaries of disability, creating non-disabled subjectivities. For these students, the network represents the opportunity to mobilise new ways of being, building social <b>capital</b> and mitigating <b>impairment.</b> Other participants experience the network as punitive and disabling. Disability is socio-technically ascribed by the social networking site and the networked public. Each inducts norms that constitute disability as a visible, deviant and deficit identity. In the highly normative conditions of the network, where every action is open to scrutiny, impairment is subjected to an unequal gaze that produces disabled subjectivities. For some students with unseen impairments, a social experience of disability is inducted for the first time. As a result, students deploy diverse strategies to retain control and resist deviant status. Self-surveillance, self-discipline and self-advocacy are evoked, each involving numerous social, cognitive and technological tactics for self-determination, including disconnection. I conclude that networks function both as Technologies of the Self and as Technologies of Power. For some disabled students, the network supports ‘normal’ status. For others, it must be resisted as a form of social domination. Importantly, in each instance, the network propels students towards disciplinary techniques that mask diversity, rendering disability and the possibility of disability invisible. Consequently, disability is both produced and suppressed by the network. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Background: The demographic, {{health and}} contextual factors {{associated}} with quality of life impairment are investigated in older persons from New South Wales, Australia. We {{examine the impact of}} cardiovascular and affective conditions on impairment and the potential moderating influence of comorbidity and remoteness. Methods: Data from persons aged 55 and over were drawn from two community cohorts sampling from across urban to very remote areas. Hierarchical linear regressions were used to assess: 1) the impact of cardiovascular and affective conditions on physical and psychological quality of life impairment; and 2) any influence of remoteness on these effects (N = 4364). Remoteness was geocoded to participants at the postal code level. Secondary data sources were used to examine the social capital and health service accessibility correlates of remoteness. Results: Physical impairment was consistently associated with increased age, male gender, lower education, being unmarried, retirement, stroke, heart attack/angina, depression/anxiety, diabetes, hypertension, current obesity and low social support. Psychological impairment was consistently associated with lower age, being unmarried, stroke, heart attack/angina, depression/anxiety and low social support. Remoteness tended to be associated with lower psychological impairment, largely reflecting overall urban versus rural differences. The impacts of cardiovascular and affective conditions on quality of life were not influenced by remoteness. Social capital increased and health service accessibility decreased with remoteness, though no differences between outer-regional and remote/very remote areas were observed. Trends suggested that social capital was associated with lower psychological impairment and that the influence of cardiovascular conditions and social <b>capital</b> on psychological <b>impairment</b> was greater for persons with a history of affective conditions. The beneficial impact of social capital in reducing psychological impairment was more marked for those experiencing financial difficulty. Conclusions: Cardiovascular and affective conditions are key determinants of physical and psychological impairment. Persons affected by physical-psychological comorbidity experience greater psychological <b>impairment.</b> Social <b>capital</b> is associated with community remoteness and may ameliorate the psychological impairment associated with affective disorders and financial difficulties. The use of classifications of remoteness that are sensitive to social and health service accessibility determinants of health may better inform future investigations into the impact of context on quality of life outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the credit risk {{mitigation}} in Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs). Currently, shariah compliant financing in Malaysia are still dominated by the concept of Bai’ Bithaman Ajil (BBA), Ijarah Thumma Al Bai and Murabahah. These sale-based approaches allow conventional credit risk mitigation to be utilized by IFIs. However, with the emergence of equity-based approach products like Musharakah/Mudharabah business financing and Musharakah Mutanaqisah Home Financing means IFIs need to enhance their perspective of credit risk which means the conventional method is not enough. Thus, this paper illustrates the concept of credit risk and differentiates them with <b>capital</b> <b>impairment</b> risk in line with the risk sharing responsibility of IFIs. This paper suggests some credit risk mitigation techniques to help IFIs create a niche for themselves in the financial market. ...|$|E
