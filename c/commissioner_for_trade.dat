2500|$|In {{a letter}} to the European <b>Commissioner</b> <b>for</b> <b>Trade,</b> Karel De Gucht, Gabriel stated in March 2014 that “special investment-protection {{provisions}} are not required in an agreement between the E.U. and the U.S” on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Instead, he later called for a public trade and investment court to replace the current system of private arbitration, and to enable appeals against arbitration rulings. Meanwhile, he has continuously warned against overblowing expectations for an economic boost from TTIP but maintained that the pact was needed to set high common standards for consumers. By August 2016, Gabriel said talks on TTIP had [...] "de facto" [...] failed.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{countries}} blamed {{each other}} for the breakdown of the negotiations. The United States and some European Union members blamed India for the failure of the talks. India claimed that its position (i.e. that the US was sacrificing the world's poor for US/European commercial interests) was supported by over 100 countries. Brazil, one of the founding members of the G-20, broke away from the position held by India. Then-European <b>Commissioner</b> <b>for</b> <b>Trade</b> Peter Mandelson said that India and China should not be blamed for the failure of the Doha round. In his view, the agriculture talks had been harmed by the five-year program of agricultural subsidies recently passed by the U.S. Congress, which he said was [...] "one of the most reactionary farm bills {{in the history of the}} U.S.".|$|E

50|$|There was no {{legislative}} assembly in British-ruled Nova Scotia {{from the time}} of the conquest in 1710 until during the Seven Years' War in 1758. The Lords <b>Commissioners</b> <b>for</b> <b>Trade</b> and Plantations (or simply the Board of Trade) in London through much of the 1750s pressured the various governors in Nova Scotia to establish the 1st General Assembly of Nova Scotia. The lack of civil government with an elected assembly was a drawback to attracting settlers from the older, established colonies of New England where the population was expanding and seeking new lands. New Englanders wanted guarantees that they would have governmental institutions the same as or similar to what they had become accustomed in New England. In 1758 the Board of Trade, anxious to attract settlers to found new townships, ordered Col. Charles Lawrence to hold an election and convene an assembly.|$|R

The <b>Commissioners</b> <b>for</b> <b>Trade</b> and Plantations rejected the validity of Fish and Gordon's [...] "pretended purchase", telling their agents it was inconsistent with the spirit of the Treaty of 1763.
