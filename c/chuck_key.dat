5000|$|The room is {{dedicated}} to famous 18th-century anatomist Bernhard Siegfried Albinus and his brother and successor Frederik Bernhard Albinus, showing {{a few of the}} over 750 wet and dry anatomical samples that Bernhard Siegfried collected, and a wide variety of medical instruments (most 1670-1700) collected by his brother: several amputation saws and knives, cauterizing irons, a wide variety of forceps and clamps, spatula's, an elevator, a bullet extractor and brace, several (drill) crowns, two drills, a lenticular, several elevatoriums, a <b>chuck</b> <b>key,</b> a coach screw, a retractor, lithotomy scoops, a Phimosis knife, gorgerets, a catheter, a bistoury cache, a combined syringotome and seton needle, a wound retractor, lithotomy directors, probes, a tobacco enema ...|$|E
50|$|Many chucks have jaws, (sometimes called dogs) {{that are}} {{arranged}} in a radially symmetrical pattern like the points of a star. The jaws are tightened up to hold the tool or workpiece. Often the jaws will be tightened or loosened {{with the help of}} a <b>chuck</b> <b>key,</b> which is a wrench-like tool made for the purpose. Many jawed chucks, however, are of the keyless variety, and their tightening and loosening is by hand force alone. Keyless designs offer the convenience of quicker and easier chucking and unchucking, but have lower gripping force to hold the tool or workpiece, which is potentially more of a problem with cylindrical than hexagonal shanks. Some lathe chucks have independently moving jaws which can also hold irregularly shaped objects (ones that lack radial symmetry). Collet chucks, rather than having jaws, have collets, which are flexible collars or sleeves that fit closely around the tool or workpiece and grip it when squeezed. A few chuck designs are more complex yet, and they involve specially shaped jaws, higher numbers of jaws, quick-release mechanisms, or other special features.|$|E
40|$|Fastener {{assembly}} {{for use in}} erecting {{truss structure}} assembled by robot equipped with one arm and one gripper. Easier for robot or human technician to build structure in outer space or on Earth. Assembly features extremely large capture envelope; accommodates initial lateral misalignments of truss members {{of as much as}} 0. 4 in. and rotational misalignments large as 28 degrees and still produces sound structural connection. <b>Chuck</b> <b>key</b> is only tool required...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Self-centering three-jaw <b>chuck</b> and <b>key</b> {{with one}} jaw removed and {{inverted}} {{showing the teeth}} that engage in the scroll plate. The scroll plate is rotated within the chuck body by the key, the scroll engages the teeth {{on the underside of}} the jaws which moves the three jaws in unison, to tighten or release the workpiece.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{returning}} to civilization, Chuck learns {{that he has}} long been given up for dead; his family and acquaintances have held a funeral, and Kelly has since married Chuck's one-time dentist and has a daughter. After reuniting with Kelly, the pair profess their {{love for each other}} but, realizing they cannot be together because of her commitment to her new family, they sadly part. Kelly gives <b>Chuck</b> the <b>keys</b> to the car they once shared.|$|R
50|$|When Casey orders him to {{head back}} inside {{to get a look}} at Juliette, Chuck hides under a table and watches as she shoots Hayes' bodyguard. Hayes panics and drops his <b>keys.</b> <b>Chuck</b> flashes and realizes the {{microchip}} is not in his vault, as he told Juliette, but on his key chain. Juliette hears Chuck talking to Casey and holds him at gunpoint. Hayes attempts to escape, but Bryce and Sarah see him. Sarah decides to save Chuck instead, leaving Bryce to go after Hayes, who escapes in his Lamborghini. Sarah gets into a shootout with Juliette, who is driven away by a henchman. Before they escape, Juliette drops a grenade on the road. Sarah sees it and pushes Chuck away, injuring herself in the process.|$|R
30|$|The first {{expandable}} prosthesis, the Lewis expandable, adjustable prosthesis, {{consisted of}} a screw extension mechanism that was turned by making a small incision and using a <b>chuck</b> <b>key</b> to turn the screw [46, 47]. This design showed favorable results, but the need for recurrent surgeries to expand the unit posed a variety of complications for the patient, including the possibilities of nerve damage and infection. To find solutions to these problems, biomechanical engineers began exploring possibilities for internally expandable prostheses [48].|$|E
30|$|Limb-salvage in {{pediatric}} patients poses {{an additional}} challenge compared to adults {{due to the}} presence of an open physis. In order to obtain a wide surgical margin, the growing physis must often be removed, creating a limb-length discrepancy. Lewis published one of the first reports on the use of expandable endoprostheses to help minimize limb length discrepancy (Lewis 1986; Kenan and Lewis 1991). These designs incorporated the use of a screw extension mechanism, where a <b>chuck</b> <b>key</b> would be inserted through an incision to expand the length of the prosthesis and thus the extremity, while later methods utilized modular body segments to achieve lengthening, requiring open surgical procedures (Lewis 1986; Kenan and Lewis 1991; Eckardt et al. 2000; Neel and Letson 2001). Jeys reported on periprosthetic infections in orthopaedic oncology conditions and found the use of expandable prostheses in children as a significant risk factor with a rate of 18  %, (p =  0.007), and that infection was increased as much as 5  % per lengthening procedure (Jeys et al. 2005). In order to accurately address limb surgery in children with sarcomas the authors feel they should mention two other techniques, amputation and arthroplasty. The former has few surgical side effects with decreased functional scores (Eckardt et al. 1985; Simon et al. 1986). Rotationplasty in the growing child has excellent function with few surgical complications (Hardes et al. 2003). Acceptance of the physical appearance of this option has limited its use (Veenstra et al. 2000).|$|E
50|$|Chuck and Sarah {{are locked}} up, and Javier confronts Chuck. Chuck {{is unable to}} flash and is beaten senseless. When he comes around again he hears Sarah {{in the next room}} over, and he laments at his {{failures}} as a spy. Sarah instead encourages him, and with her life also now in danger, Chuck is able to regain control of the Intersect. When Javier returns, he flashes and knocks him out. <b>Chuck</b> takes his <b>keys</b> and a strange device, then flees the compound with Sarah. They are pinned down on a rooftop, but he flashes and they use a power line as a zip cord. Unfortunately they are once again surrounded. Just in time, Casey arrives in a helicopter gunship. Javier is killed during their attack and Chuck and Sarah are rescued.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Top: an {{assembled}} keyless chuck. This type of chuck is tightened by {{twisting the}} body using firm hand pressure only. While convenient, this feature {{can cause the}} chuck to loosen if too much torque is applied. Bottom: the widely used keyed type of drill <b>chuck</b> with its <b>key.</b> The arbor is shown separately to the right. These chucks require a toothed key to provide the necessary torque to tighten and loosen the jaws. When the key is turned its teeth mate with teeth on the chuck, turning an internal screw which in turn moves the threaded jaws in or out along a tapered surface. The taper allows the jaws to clamp drill shanks {{of a range of}} diameters. The end view shows the three small jaws that slide within the body.|$|R
50|$|Chuck returns home, dejected and depressed. He's greeted {{at home by}} Ellie and Devon, and {{mentions}} that he's lost Sarah. Chuck spends his days on the couch eating cheese balls and grows unkempt. Even a visit from Morgan is unable to bring Chuck out of his depressed state. Prompted by Devon, he tries to call Sarah, but she ignores his call and throws her phone away into a pool where she's relaxing with another man. Later, he heads to the Buy More when he runs out of cheese balls, but is confronted by Emmett, who begins to berate him. Chuck begins to flash and struggles to restrain an automatic attempt to throttle Emmett. Jeff and Lester mention having seen Sarah at the Orange Orange, and <b>Chuck</b> uses his <b>key</b> to sneak in. Instead he's caught by Casey, {{who is in the}} process of cleaning out Castle. Chuck learns that he and Sarah have a mission, and when Casey refuses to let him join, he takes it on himself to clean up and go anyway.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{introduces a}} novel method of teleoperation of complex anthropomorphic robotic hands: converting the myoelectric signal generated by an operator's muscles during movement into robot commands replicating the motion. This teleoperation scenario is, in a sense, the limiting case of myoelectric prosthetic hand control. This project contributes to {{implementation of a}} practical myoelectric teleoperation system and improved prosthetic hand control by analyzing the myoelectric spectrum's variation during thumb motions. The investigation applies a new spectral estimation approach, Thomson's multiple window method (MWM), to the myoelectric signal. The MWM estimate has much lower bias and variance than traditional periodogram estimates, making it a better candidate to compute motion classification features. The MWM is also less sensitive to motion artifact than autoregressive methods. Extending Thomson's MWM into a time-frequency analysis tool analogous to the short-time Fourier transform, here called the short-time Thomson transform, shows that the myoelectric signal may be more stationary than previously thought. This project includes development of a unique myoelectric data collection system (MDCS) and a myoelectric teleoperation demonstration system (MTDS). The MDCS allows simultaneous measurement of 16 hand joint motions and 8 myoelectric signals. This capability enables close alignment of myoelectric signatures in time based on the hand motions and a search for motion-specific temporal characteristics in the myoelectric signal. While this study yields little evidence of motion-specific temporal consistency, it shows promising motion-specific spectral consistency. Spectral analysis proves less sensitive to alignment uncertainties than temporal analysis. An evaluation of five techniques for finding a motion's starting point in the myoelectric signal, a major implementation concern, suggests that we not pursue alignment-sensitive myoelectric control algorithms. Finally, the MTDS is used to demonstrate myoelectric control of <b>chuck</b> and <b>key</b> grasp motions of NASA/JSC's Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand, realtime, with 90 % accuracy. The demonstration uses the time-varying myoelectric spectrum estimated with short-time Fourier transforms; however, this project lays the foundation for using the superior short-time Thomson transforms in this application...|$|R
