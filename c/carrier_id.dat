40|$|Association between ACE gene I/D {{polymorphism}} and {{the risk}} of overweight/obesity remains controversial. We investigated the possible relationship between ACE gene I/D polymorphism and obesity in Chinese type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) patients. In this study, obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) value ≥ 25 [*]kg/m 2 and subjects were classified into 4 groups (lean, normal, overweight, and obese). PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was used to detect the ACE gene I/D polymorphism in T 2 DM patients. Metabolic measurements including blood glucose, lipid profile, and blood pressure were obtained. Frequencies of the ACE genotypes (DD, ID, and II) were not significant among the 4 groups of BMI-defined patients (P= 0. 679) while ACE II carriers showed higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) (all P< 0. 050). Hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in these T 2 DM patients were found to be significantly associated with BMI. In conclusion, the relationship of ACE gene I/D polymorphism with obesity is insignificant in Chinese patients with T 2 DM. SBP and PP might be higher in the ACE II carriers than in the DD and <b>ID</b> <b>carriers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Study objectives: {{examine the}} {{frequency}} of genotypes and alleles of I/D polymorphism of gene ADRA 2 B of native people living in Mountain Shoria (the Shors), {{as well as their}} association with risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Material and methods. Overall 221 native people of Shoria were examined. The average age is 51. 07 ± 1. 46 among males, 52. 93 ± 0. 96 among females (p = 0. 286). Anthropometric characteristics, lipid levels of blood and I/D polymorphism of ADRA 2 B were studied. Results. DD genotype of the gene ADRA 2 B in the native population of the Shor people is associated with adiposis and high index of "waist/hip", hypertriglyceridemia. The average values of Quetelet index is higher in carriers of this genotype compared with <b>carriers</b> of genotype <b>ID.</b> Average waist indications in homozygous insertions were lower than those in homozygous deletions and heterozygotes. Patients with genotype DD have higher average levels of triglycerides, atherogenic index, cholesterol, very low density lipoproteins. Conclusion.

40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} {{putative}} significance of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) in colorectal cancer (CRC) biology. Local expression of ACE was investigated by quantitative reverse transcription- {{polymerase chain reaction}} and by immunohistochemistry in CRCs and adenomas. ACE insertion (I) /deletion (D) polymorphism was studied in 141 CRC patients and 189 controls. ACE mRNA was upregulated in CRCs compared to corresponding nonlesional tissues (2. 5 -fold; P =. 009). ACE protein was more commonly expressed in adenomas [17 (81 %) ] and cancer epithelial cells [22 (100 %) ] than in corresponding non-neoplastic crypt and surface epithelium [2 (10 %) and 2 (9 %), respectively]. Thirty-seven CRC patients (26 %) carried II genotype, 69 (49 %) carried ID genotype, 35 (25 %) carried DD genotype. The distribution of the genotypes {{did not differ from}} that of controls. Female CRC patients more commonly carried the ID genotype and less frequently the II and DD genotypes compared with male patients (P =. 033). Men heterozygous or homozygous for the D-allele had larger tumors compared to carriers of the II genotype (P <. 01). Women homozygous for the D-allele lived longer than <b>carriers</b> of the <b>ID</b> and II genotypes. Our study shows that ACE is differentially expressed in CRCs and that gene polymorphism is associated with gender-specific differences in primary tumor size and patient survival...|$|R
40|$|Background. Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD) is a renal disease characterized by an important variability in clinical course, which cannot be fully explained by the genetic heterogeneity of the disease. Although the role for the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism as a modifier factor in ADPKD renal deterioration has been suggested, direct evidence from genetic association studies remain inconclusive. To provide a more robust estimate of the putative effect of the ACE I/D polymorphism on the renal progression in ADPKD, we performed a meta-analysis pooling data from all relevant studies in which {{the role of the}} ACE I/D variant in ADPKD clinical features was evaluated. Methods. We applied a random-effects model to combine odds ratio and 95 % confidence intervals. Q-statistic was used to evaluate the homogeneity, and both Egger's and Begg-Mazumdar tests were used to assess publication bias. Results. Altogether, three distinct meta-analyses were generated using data from 13 studies. Despite the absence of publication bias and the presence of homogeneity among study results, the DD genotype failed to show an influence on risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), mean age at ESRD or risk of hypertension in ADPKD patients when compared with I-allele <b>carriers</b> (DD vs <b>ID</b> + II). Likewise, meta-analyses carried out separately for Caucasian and Asian studies showed no indication of an association between the DD genotype and a faster renal deterioration in ADPKD. Conclusion. These findings do not support the hypothesis that the enhanced ACE activity associated with the D allele might promote a significantly worse prognosis in patients with ADPKD.

C-prune is the C-terminal domain of h-prune, overexpressed in breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers, interacting with multiple partners, and representing an ideal target for inhibition of cancer development. Its C-terminal domain results in an intrinsically disordered domain (IDD), and the peculiar properties of gH 625 render it an optimal candidate {{to act as a}} carrier for this net negatively charged molecule by comparison with the positively charged TAT. A characterization of the recombinant gH 625 -c-prune fusion protein was conducted by biochemical, cellular biology and confocal microscopy means in comparison with TAT-c-prune. The results showed that the gH 625 -c-prune exhibited the ability to cross biomembranes, opening a new scenario on the use of gH 625 as a novel multifunctional <b>carrier.</b> Keywords: delivery, <b>ID...</b>|$|R

A anemia hipocromica microcitica e a forma mais comum em criancas e adolescentes. Dentre as causas desta anemia estao: a) deficiencia de ferro, que resulta de um longo periodo do balanco negativo do micronutriente e causa retardo no crescimento e comprometimento do desempenho cognitivo de criancas; b) contaminacao por chumbo (plumbismo) que tambem afeta o desenvolvimento das criancas, podendo ser agravada nos portadores de polimorfismo da enzima ALAD; c) hemoglobinopatias (hemoglobinas variantes e talassemias), anemias herdadas que afetam 7 % da populacao mundial. Devido a alta prevalencia destas patologias, o presente trabalho teve como objetivo estudar um grupo de criancas de escolas publicas, identificando os fatores que contribuem para o desenvolvimento de anemias hipocromicas microciticas e estabelecer relacoes entre as caracteristicas laboratoriais das doencas. Participaram do estudo 427 criancas, com idade entre 6 a 9 anos, sendo 235 do sexo feminino e 192 do sexo masculino, alunos de Escolas Municipais e Estaduais, da zona norte da cidade de Ribeirao Preto-SP. Foram analisados: a) numero global de eritrocitos e leucocitos, concentracao de hemoglobina, hematocrito, indices hematimetricos e distribuicao da {{amplitude}} das celulas vermelhas (contador automatico Micros 45. Horiba ABXR) e calculo do indice matematico RDWI; b) niveis plasmaticos de chumbo (espectrometro de massa com plasma indutivamente acoplado VG Plasmaquad PQIIR) e estudo das delecoes dos polimorfismos da enzima ALAD, por PCR; c) status ferrico pelos niveis de ferritina serica (imunoquimioluminescencia utilizando kit Ferritin Immulite. DPCR e equipamento Immulite 1 - DPCR), receptor de transferrina soluvel (ensaio imunoenzimatico, utilizando o kit Quantikine soluble transferrin receptor da R&D SystemsR e o leitor de microplacas de ELISA READER 210, modelo Microwell System Organon TeknikaR) e calculo do indice sTfR/log ferritina; d) analise das hemoglobinas por eletroforese em acetato de celulose, pH alcalino, por HPLC (sistema automatizado Variant II Bio-RadR e kit gÀ-talassemia Short Program) e PCR para {{a principal}} delecao de ¿- talassemias. Com base no criterio recomendado pela OMS para definir anemia (Hb menor que 11, 5 g/dL), verificou-se que 75 (17, 6 %) criancas eram anemicas, sendo 33 (44 %) portadoras de algum tipo de hemoglobinopatia, 29 (38, 6 %) com anemias de causa desconhecida e 13 (17, 4 %) com anemia por deficiencia de ferro. Das anemias, apenas 14 eram anemias hipocromicas microciticas, sendo que 10 (71, 4 %) eram algum tipo de hemoglobinopatia, 2 (14, 2 %) ADF e 2 (14, 2 %) de causa desconhecida. Na populacao estudada, a prevalencia de hemoglobinopatias foi de 16, 6 %, a saber: 11, 6 % com ¿-talassemia; 4 % com aumento de Hb F; 3, 5 % com Hb AS; 2, 8 % com À-talassemia; 0, 96 % com ¿/À-talassemia e 0, 24 % com Hb AC. Os niveis de chumbo plasmatico, em todos os participantes do estudo, estavam dentro do recomendado pelo Center for Disease Control and Prevention (< 10 Êg/dL), nao havendo interferencia do metal na patogenese das anemias. Nao houve associacao entre os polimorfismos da ALAD- 1 (ALAD 1 - 1 e ALAD 1 - 2) e os niveis de chumbo plasmatico. Anemia por deficiencia de ferro foi diagnosticada em 3 % das criancas e DF em 6, 1 %, utilizando um cut off de 30 ng/mL para ferritina serica. Houve concordancia na identificacao de hemoglobinopatias utilizando as metodologias eletroforese de hemoglobina em acetato de celulose e HPLC, sendo que estas metodologias nao sao uteis para diagnosticar ¿-talassemia. Para identificar os portadores da delecao de ¿-talassemia (. ¿ 3, 7) e necessaria a utilizacao da análise molecular (PCR). A suspeita de Hb S/-talassemia identificada por HPLC deve ser confirmada por análise dos pais e/ou irmãos. A ferritina foi um bom parâmetro para identificar DF precocemente e útil para diferenciar os portadores de hemoglobinopatias dos portadores de DF e ADF. O índice sTfR/log da ferritina foi mais sensível do que o sTfR, na diferenciação de DF e talassemia. No diagnóstico das anemias hipocrômicas microcíticas é necessário analisar um conjunto de determinações, incluindo exame hematológico, status férrico, perfil eletroforético, em alguns casos incluindo avaliação dos familiares, e análise molecular das hemoglobinopatias. Several {{factors contribute to}} the development of anemia, which constitutes one of the most serious problems in public health. The hypochromic microcytic anemia is the most common type in children and adolescents. Among the causes for this type of anemia are: a) iron deficiency, which results from a long period of negative balance of the micronutrient, causing delay in growth and compromising the cognitive performance of the children; b) contamination by lead (lead poisoning), which also affects the development of children, and may be aggravated in carriers of polymorphism of the enzyme ALAD; c) hemoglobinopathies (variants hemoglobin and thalassemia), inherited anemia that affects 7 % of the world population. Due to the high prevalence of these pathologies, the present study aimed at studying a group of children from public schools, identifying the factors that {{contribute to the development}} of hypochromic microcytic anemia and establishing relations between the laboratorial characteristics of the diseases. The study had the participation of 427 children, aged between 6 and 9 years old, being 235 female and 192 male students from Municipal and State Schools in the north area of Ribeirao Preto-SP. It analyzed: a) number of erythrocytes and leucocytes, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, red cell indices and red cell distribution width (automatic counter Micros 45. Horiba ABXR) and calculation of the mathematical index RDWI; b) plasma lead levels (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer VG PlasmaQuad PQIIR) and study of the deletions of the polymorphisms of the enzyme ALAD, by PCR; c) iron status by serum ferritin levels (immunochemiluminescence using the kit Ferritin Immulite. DPCR and the equipment Immulite 1 - DPCR), soluble transferrin receptor (enzyme immune assay, using the kit Quantikine soluble transferrin receptor of R&D SystemsR and the microplate reader ELISA READER 210, model Microwell System Organon TeknikaR) and calculation of the sTfR/log ferritin index; d) hemoglobin analysis by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate at alkaline pH, HPLC (automated system Variant II Bio-RadR and the kit gÀ-thalassemia Short Program) and PCR for the main deletion of ¿-thalassemias. Based on the WHO criteria by to define anemia (Hb under 11. 5 g/dL), it was verified that 75 (17. 6 %) children were anemic, being 33 (44 %) with hemoglobinopathy, 29 (38. 6 %) with anemia of unknown causes and 13 (17. 4 %) with iron deficiency anemia. Among the anemias, only 14 were hypochromic microcytic, 10 (71. 4 %) being some sort of hemoglobinopathy, 2 (14. 2 %) due to iron deficiency and 2 (14. 2 %) due to unknown causes. In the studied population, the prevalence of hemoglobinopathies was 16. 6 %, namely: 11. 6 % with ¿-thalassemia; 4 % with Hb F elevated; 3. 5 % with Hb AS; 2. 8 % with À- thalassemia; 0. 96 % with ¿/À-thalassemia and 0. 24 % with Hb AC. The plasma lead levels, in all participants of the study, were within the levels recommended by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (< 10 Êg/dL), without the interference of the metal in the pathogenesis of the anemias. There was no significant association between the polymorphisms of the ALAD- 1 (ALAD 1 - 1 and ALAD 1 - 2) and the plasma lead levels. Iron deficiency anemia was diagnosed in 3 % of the children and ID in 6. 1 %, using a cutoff of 30 ng/mL for serum ferritin. There was agreement in the identification of hemoglobinopathies using the methodologies electrophoresis of hemoglobin in cellulose acetate and the HPLC, as these methodologies are not useful to diagnose ¿-thalassemia. In order to identify the carriers of ¿-thalassemia gene deletion (. ¿ 3, 7) it is necessary to use the molecular analysis (PCR). The suspicion of Hb S/À-thalassemia identified by HPLC must be confirmed through the analysis iv of the parents and/or siblings. The ferritin was a good parameter to identify ID early and useful to differ the carriers of hemoglobinopathies of the <b>carriers</b> of <b>ID</b> and IDA. The sTfR/log ferritin level was more sensitive than the sTfR, in the differentiation of ID and thalassemia. In the diagnosis of the hypochromic microcytic anemias, it is necessary to analyze a set of determinations, including hematological exam, iron status, electrophoretic profile, in some cases including relatives, and molecular analysis of the hemoglobinopathies...|$|R
