5|$|According to flashbacks {{during the}} game, Squall {{grew up in}} an orphanage with the other playable {{characters}} (except Rinoa). The orphans were cared for by Edea; although Squall remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> introverted boy whose original goal is to go through life without any emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his detachment from his companions is a defensive mechanism to protect himself from the emotional pain he suffered when he and his older sister were separated.|$|E
5|$|Robert Morse (Danny Webb) is loud, argumentative, <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> Golic's only friend. Golic, who {{has been}} {{restrained}} in the infirmary since the deaths of Boggs and Rains, convinces Morse to free him; he subdues Morse, and releases the creature. After Dillon's death, Morse helps Ripley reach {{the top of the}} furnace so she can kill the Alien Queen and then herself by deliberately falling into the vat of molten lead. At {{the end of the film}} he is led away by Weyland-Yutani personnel, the only surviving resident of Fury 161.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} sound film {{created a new}} job market for writers of screen dialogue. Many {{newspaper}} journalists moved to California and became studio-employed screenwriters. This resulted {{in a series of}} fast-talking comedy pictures featuring newsmen. The Front Page, later re-made as the much less <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> more sentimental post-Code His Girl Friday (1940), was adapted from the Broadway play by Chicago newsmen, and Hollywood screenwriters, Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. It was based on Hecht's experiences working as a reporter for the Chicago Daily Journal.|$|E

5|$|Lead Balloon is a British {{television}} series produced by Open Mike Productions for BBC Four. The series was created and is co-written by comedian Jack Dee and Pete Sinclair. It stars Dee as Rick Spleen, a <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> misanthropic comedian whose life is plagued by petty annoyances, disappointments and embarrassments. Raquel Cassidy, Sean Power and Tony Gardner also star. The first series of six episodes was broadcast on BBC Four in 2006, {{with the first}} episode achieving the highest ratings for a comedy on the channel. Repeats of the series were run on BBC Two and BBC HD, bringing it to a larger audience. The second series of eight episodes aired on BBC Two from November 2007; the third series aired from November 2008; and the final series aired from 31 May 2011 until 5 July.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{although}} Munch (Richard Belzer) is <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> despairing {{over his}} recent break-up with ex-girlfriend Felicia, the normally-grumpy Bolander (Ned Beatty) is unusually cheerful {{as a result}} of his budding romantic relationship with Linda (Julianna Margulies), a much younger (26-year-old) waitress. Nervous about his first real date with her, Bolander asks Howard (Melissa Leo) to go on a double-date with him, along with Howard's boyfriend, prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers (Željko Ivanek). The double date goes well until a lonely Munch crashes, joins the table and ruins the mood of the evening complaining about his romantic woes. Bolander, Munch and Linda leave together and walk to Fort McHenry, where Linda offers Munch words of encouragement. Impressed with her, Munch leaves Linda and Bolander alone, where they happily watch a fireworks show.|$|E
5|$|Animated {{television}} advertisements starring the transgender playboy cow Graham Heffer {{ran from}} 1999 until 2002. The adverts attracted complaints {{from the public}} for allegedly promoting bestiality, homosexuality and drug-taking. Boddingtons become an official partner of the 2002 XVII Commonwealth Games held in Manchester in a deal worth at least £1million. To mark the occasion, a special Boddingtons 5% ABV Commonwealth Ale cask ale was produced for the North West of England, and subsequently launched nationwide. The last Boddingtons television advertising campaign in 2005 was criticised for capitalising on the beer's Manchester heritage with a Happy Mondays soundtrack, even though production had {{moved out of the}} city. Mike Thompson, a former worker at the brewery and representative of the Transport & General Workers' Union, said: This is at best <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> at worst a slur on our great city, its heritage and the Strangeways workers. People have lost their livelihoods because of how this company has behaved. They will not be best pleased at what we can only see as pouring salt on the wounds.|$|E

5|$|When {{the series}} begins, Allen is about 15 years old. Although {{most of his}} colleagues assume he is ageing normally, one of his enemies (Nea, who later {{possesses}} his body), suspects {{that he may be}} growing younger. Allen is often accompanied by Timcampy, a small flying golem given him by his mentor (Exorcist general Cross Marian). As a result of the trauma of attempting to revive his guardian, Mana Walker, Allen's reddish-brown hair becomes white. Mana's curse of the boy's left eye allows Allen to distinguish Akuma from humans. Allen is devoted to helping the Akuma find peace until he meets the Exorcists of the Black Order, who become his friends. Realizing that he fights to save the souls of the Akuma and for his human friends, he devotes himself equally to both causes. Allen's master, Cross Marian, notes that the boy (originally <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> rude), has adopted Mana's formal speech, mannerisms and personality. Allen begins to speak less formally during the series, reverting to his speech before he met Mana.|$|E

25|$|Trust is a {{defining}} feature of psychosocial development, personality theory, and folk psychological conceptions of personality.

25|$|Basil Fawlty, {{played by}} John Cleese, is a <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> snobbish misanthrope who is desperate {{to belong to}} a higher social class.

25|$|Hughes's first collection, The Hawk in the Rain (1957), {{attracted}} considerable critical acclaim. In 1959 {{he won the}} Galbraith prize, {{which brought}} $5,000. His most significant work is perhaps Crow (1970), which whilst it has been widely praised also divided critics, combining an apocalyptic, bitter, <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> surreal {{view of the universe}} with what sometimes appeared simple, childlike verse.|$|E

25|$|The album {{not only}} helped {{establish}} Danny!'s freewheeling and emotional persona (a sharp contrast from the <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> extremely sarcastic characteristics he would reveal on subsequent albums), but also helped reiterate the ethic of DIY {{used by many}} emerging underground hip-hop artists at the time, such as Little Brother, Lupe Fiasco and Tanya Morgan, who too would see moderate popularity on the Internet translate into a recording contract with major or independent record labels.|$|E
25|$|By {{the twentieth}} century, Buddhism had {{penetrated}} {{deeply into the}} culture of Mongolia, and the populace willingly supported the lamas and the monasteries. Foreign observers usually had a negative opinion of Mongolian monks, condemning them as lazy, ignorant, corrupt, and debauched, but the Mongolian people did not concur. Ordinary Mongolians apparently combined a <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> realistic anticlericalism, sensitive to the faults and the human fallibility of individual monks or groups of monks, with a deep and unwavering concern for the transcendent values of the church.|$|E
25|$|Rocko's Modern Life {{follows the}} life of a timid Australian {{immigrant}} wallaby named Rocko (voiced by Carlos Alazraqui), who encounters various dilemmas and situations regarding otherwise mundane aspects of life. His best friends are: Heffer Wolfe (Tom Kenny), a fat and enthusiastic steer; Filburt (Mr. Lawrence), a neurotic turtle who often feels uncomfortable or disturbed; and his faithful dog Spunky (Alazraqui). Living next door to Rocko are a middle-aged couple, Ed Bighead (Charlie Adler), a <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> crass toad who despises Rocko; and his compassionate wife Bev (Adler).|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the group's later work, the album has a very dark, abrasive, <b>and</b> <b>cynical</b> tone <b>and</b> incorporated a grunge and heavy metal influenced sound. As well, the album's two title tracks are direct attacks on the Catholic Church, which are unique for an otherwise apolitical band. The opening track, [...] "Everything Flows", is a mellow powerpop-influenced song (unlike {{the rest of the}} album) that provides a sort of blueprint for their later work.|$|R
25|$|The {{depiction}} of the cat, Jiji, changed significantly in the Disney version. In the Japanese version Jiji is voiced by Rei Sakuma, while in the English version Jiji is voiced by comedian Phil Hartman. In Japanese culture, cats are usually depicted with feminine voices, whereas in American culture their voices are more gender-specific. A number of Hartman's lines exist where Jiji simply says nothing in the original. Jiji's personality is notably different between the two versions, showing a more <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> sarcastic attitude in the Disney English version as opposed to cautious and conscientious in the original Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Andrzej Sapkowski. Sapkowski {{is one of}} the bestselling Polish authors, {{translated}} into many languages (recently into English), he {{is best known for his}} The Witcher fantasy series. The main character of the series is Geralt, a mutant assassin trained from childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters and other unnatural creatures. Geralt moves in an ambiguous moral universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At once <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> noble, Geralt has been compared to Raymond Chandler's signature character Philip Marlowe. The world in which these adventures take place owes much to J.R.R. Tolkien, while also heavily influenced by Polish history and Slavic mythology.|$|E
25|$|Despite his adventurous career, mere reminiscences {{obviously}} bored him; he {{was always}} for movement, for some betterment of present or future conditions, and in discussion he was {{a master of the}} art of persuasion, unconsciously creating in those around him a latent desire to follow, if he would lead. The source of such persuasive influence eludes analysis, and, like the mystery of leadership, is probably more psychic than mental. In this latter respect, Jameson was splendidly equipped; he had greater power of concentration, of logical reasoning, and of rapid diagnosis, while on his lighter side he was brilliant in repartee and in the exercise of a badinage that was both <b>cynical</b> <b>and</b> personal...|$|E
