Kinetic <b>control</b> <b>means</b> that the forward aldol addition reaction must be significantly faster than the reverse retro-aldol reaction. For this approach to succeed, two other conditions must also be satisfied; it must be possible to quantitatively form the enolate of one partner, and the forward aldol reaction must be significantly faster than {{the transfer of the}} enolate from one partner to another. Common kinetic control conditions involve the formation of the enolate of a ketone with LDA at −78°C, followed by the slow addition of an aldehyde.|$|E

An Afghan committee sorts the detainees into two groups: One group awaits criminal prosecution, and the other will be referred to a review board, which evaluates them and recommends whether to keep holding them without trial as wartime detainees. As of September 5, 2012 638 detaines have been approved for criminal prosecution, and 963 have been referred to the review board. The United States military will maintain control over dozens of foreign detainees in Bagram for the indefinite future. [...] "If we keep these people with us in this current situation and deal with them, this will create more problems for us," [...] General Ghulam Farouk, the Afghan official who runs the Afghan-controlled portions of Parwan, said. [...] "Therefore it is better for the Americans to keep them." [...] Further, although thousands of Afghan detainees have already been turned over, the United States will continue to hold and screen newly captured Afghans for a time, ensuring continued American involvement in detention and interrogation activities.|$|E

If mankind is to be saved from destruction {{there must be a}} world control; a world <b>control</b> <b>means</b> a world government, it is only another name for it, and manifestly that government must have a navy that will supersede the British navy, artillery that will supersede the French artillery, air forces superseding all existing air forces, and so forth. For many flags there must be one sovereign flag; orbis terrarum. Unless a world control amounts to that it will be ridiculous, just as a judge supported by two or three unarmed policemen, a newspaper reporter and the court chaplain, proposing to enforce his decisions in a court packed with the heavily armed friends of the plaintiff and defendant would be ridiculous. But the common man is supposed to be so blindly and incurably set upon his British navy or his French army, or whatever his pet national instrument of violence may be, that it is held to be impossible to supersede these beloved and adored forces. If that is so, then a world law is impossible, and the wisest course before us is to snatch such small happiness as we may hope to do and leave the mad elephant to work its will in the garden.|$|E

40|$|We study control variate {{estimation}} {{where the}} <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> itself is estimated. Control variate estimation in simulation experiments can significantly increase sampling efficiency, and {{has traditionally been}} restricted to cases where the control has a known mean. In a previous paper (Schmeiser, Taaffe, and Wang (2000)), we generalized the idea of control variate estimation to the case where the <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> is only approximated. The result is a biased, but possibly useful estimator. For that case we provided a mean-square-error optimal estimator and discussed its properties. In this paper we also generalize classical control variate estimation {{to the case of}} control variates using estimated control means(CVEMs). CVEMsreplacethecontrolmeanwithanestimated value for the <b>control</b> <b>mean,</b> obtained from a prior simulation experiment. Although the resulting control-variate estimator is unbiased, it does introduce additional sampling error and so its properties {{are not the same as}} those of the standard control-variate estimator. We develop a CVEM estimator that minimizes the overall estimator variance. Both BCVs and CVEMs can be used to improve the efficiency of stochastic simulation experiments. Their main appeal is that the restriction of having to know (deterministically) the exact value of the <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> is eliminated; thus the space of possible controls is greatly increased.

Whole plasma calcitonin (iCT) and extracted monomeric calcitonin (eCT) basal levels, metabolic clearance rate (MCR) and production rate (PR) of iCT and eCT were measured in 41 postmenopausal women, including 14 hip fractures (OP II) and 27 healthy controls. No significant difference appeared for basal iCT levels between OP II (mean +/- SEM: 41. 9 +/- 3. 4 pg/ml) and <b>controls</b> (<b>mean</b> +/- SEM: 46. 2 +/- 5 pg/ml). eCT basal levels were similar in OP II (mean +/- SEM: 5. 42 +/- 0. 5 pg/ml) and in <b>controls</b> (<b>mean</b> +/- SEM: 7. 3 +/- 0. 7 pg/ml).

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{investigate}} {{the expression of}} thrombomodulin in scleroderma associated pulmonary hypertension.  METHODS—Soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), was measured in plasma samples from 34  scleroderma patients shown to have pulmonary hypertension at echocardiogram, and comparison drawn against samples from 38  scleroderma control patients, and 20  healthy controls. Serial measurements of sTM were performed in the 34  patients with scleroderma associated pulmonary hypertension to investigate possible changes in sTM concentration with progression of the condition.  RESULTS—Mean sTM was raised in scleroderma associated pulmonary hypertension when compared with scleroderma <b>controls</b> (<b>mean</b> sTM 65. 4  ng/ml v 43. 3  ng/ml, p< 0. 05), and when compared with healthy <b>controls</b> (<b>mean</b> sTM 38. 1  ng/ml, p< 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference}} between mean sTM in scleroderma controls and healthy <b>controls.</b> <b>Mean</b> sTM concentration did not change with progression of pulmonary hypertension.  CONCLUSION—Plasma sTM is raised in scleroderma associated pulmonary hypertension.

40|$|Abstract Growth rate is {{the main}} {{breeding}} goal of fish breeders, but individual selection has often shown poor responses in fish species. The PROSPER method was developed to overcome possible factors that may contribute to this low success, using (1) a variable base population and high number of breeders (Ne > 100), (2) selection within groups with low non-genetic effects and (3) repeated growth challenges. Using calculations, we show that individual selection within groups, with appropriate management of maternal effects, can be superior to mass selection {{as soon as the}} maternal effect ratio exceeds 0. 15, when heritability is 0. 25. Practically, brown trout were selected on length at the age of one year with the PROSPER method. The genetic gain was evaluated against an unselected control line. After four generations, the mean response per generation in length at one year was 6. 2 % of the <b>control</b> <b>mean,</b> while the mean correlated response in weight was 21. 5 % of the <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> per generation. At the 4 th generation, selected fish also appeared to be leaner than control fish when compared at the same size, and the response on weight was maximal (≈ 130 % of the <b>control</b> <b>mean)</b> between 386 and 470 days post fertilisation.

30|$|A similar {{argument}} may {{be directed}} towards {{the patterns of}} performance observed on the Crowds test. Using the original criterion of 1.96 SDs above the <b>control</b> <b>mean,</b> only one participant outperformed controls. Although the Crowds test had the greatest variability in performance of both controls and self-referred SRs, it was calibrated so that performance up to 3 SDs from the <b>control</b> <b>mean</b> could be detected (as confirmed in initial pilot-testing), and correct responses were recorded from at least some participants for every trial. It is possible that this test relies on {{a different set of}} sub-processes to the other three tests, and that successful performance relies less on the face recognition system itself. Indeed, the searching of crowds requires a range of perceptual and attentional skills that are likely not employed in face recognition tasks involving the simultaneous presentation of only two or three faces. Notably, a larger proportion of the control compared to the experimental sample performed above 1 SD from the <b>control</b> <b>mean,</b> and the top and bottom performers in the experimental group displayed varied performance on the other tests in the battery. However, given that we did not test for consistency in performance on this task, we cannot firmly reach this conclusion without further testing. Alternatively, it may be the use of composite faces that has brought about differences in performance levels.|$|R
