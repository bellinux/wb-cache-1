5|$|<b>Corrective</b> <b>rape</b> is on {{the rise}} in South Africa. More than 10 lesbians are raped or gang-raped weekly, as {{estimated}} by Luleki Sizwe, a South African nonprofit. It is estimated that at least 500 lesbians become victims of <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> every year and that 86% of black lesbians in the Western Cape live in fear of being sexually assaulted, as reported by the Triangle Project in 2008. Yet, victims of <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> are less likely to report it because of the negative social view of homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Williamson {{and other}} members of Jamaica's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and {{transgender}} (LGBT) community decided to form an organisation to campaign for their rights, resulting in the establishment of the Jamaica Forum for Lesbians, All Sexuals, and Gays (J-FLAG) in December 1998. J-FLAG sought to enhance LGBT rights through advocacy and encouraging legal reform, as well as through educational and social service programs. They also kept a record of anti-LGBT hate crimes including assaults, home invasions, and the <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> of lesbians, further recording the murder of 30 gay men between 1997 and 2004. From the time of the group's foundation, its members were subjected to repeated death threats. Williamson became the public face of the group, appearing on radio talk shows and television shows such as Perspective and Nationwide in which he argued against homophobia and called for greater government investment to tackle the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Unlike most other LGBT rights activists in Jamaica, Williamson did not seek to protect himself by using a pseudonym, disguising his voice, or hiding his appearance. Facing hostility and threats of violence, Williamson left Jamaica and moved to Canada and then England, before returning to the island in 2002. There, he moved into an apartment in his Haughton Street compound and decided to take a renewed role within Jamaica's LGBT rights movement. He lived in one room of his apartment block and rented out a number of others.|$|E
500|$|A 2012 study {{published}} in Group Processes & Intergroup Relations reported that asexuals are evaluated more negatively in terms of prejudice, dehumanization and discrimination than other sexual minorities, such as gay men, lesbians and bisexuals. Both homosexual and heterosexual people thought of asexuals as not only cold, but also animalistic and unrestrained. A different study, however, found little evidence of serious discrimination against asexuals because of their asexuality. Asexual activist, author, and blogger Julie Decker has observed that sexual harassment and violence, such as <b>corrective</b> <b>rape,</b> commonly victimizes the asexual community. Sociologist Mark Carrigan sees a middle ground, arguing that while asexuals do often experience discrimination, it is not of a phobic nature but [...] "more about marginalization because people genuinely don't understand asexuality." ...|$|E
2500|$|South Africa {{became the}} first African nation to legalize {{same-sex}} marriage in 2006, and it remains the only African country where same-sex marriage is legal. Despite this uptick in tolerance of the LGBT community in South Africa, so-called <b>corrective</b> <b>rapes</b> have become prevalent in response, primarily targeting the poorer women who live in townships {{and those who have}} no recourse in responding to the crimes because of the notable lack of police presence and prejudice they may face for reporting assaults.|$|R
50|$|As a {{director}} for the FEW foundation, Kheswa's work {{has been instrumental in}} lobbying for protection against hate crimes, including <b>corrective</b> <b>rapes</b> against women, which happen routinely and often go unpunished, despite being in opposition to South African law which states that LGBT people have fair and equal rights. Women often face physical torture, rape, and even death, as was the case of professional football player Eudy Simelane who was stabbed 25 times and killed. The FEW was established in 2002 in Johannesburg, and uses a variety of tools to increase the recognition of gay rights including leadership programs to encourage people to stand up for themselves and their communities, organization of campaigns that lobby for hate crime legislation, and health rights projects.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} a number of cases in which gay women have been the victims of murder, beating or rape. This has been posited, in part, to be because of the {{perceived}} threat they pose to traditional male authority. South Africa has no specific hate crime legislation; human rights organisations have criticised the South African police for failing to address the matter of bias motivated crimes. For example, the NGO ActionAid has condemned the continued impunity and accused governments of turning a blind eye to reported murders of lesbians in homophobic attacks in South Africa; as well as to so-called <b>corrective</b> <b>rapes,</b> including cases among pupils, in which cases the male rapists purport to raping the lesbian victim with the intent of thereby curing her of her sexual orientation.|$|R
500|$|In South Africa, lesbians are {{raped by}} {{heterosexual}} {{men with a}} goal of punishment of [...] "abnormal" [...] behavior and reinforcement of societal norms. The crime was first identified in South Africa where it is sometimes supervised {{by members of the}} woman's family or local community, and is a major contributor to HIV infection in South African lesbians. [...] "Corrective rape" [...] is not recognized by the South African legal system as a hate crime {{despite the fact that the}} South African Constitution states that no person shall be discriminated against based on their social status and identity, including sexual orientation. Legally, South Africa protects gay rights extensively, but the government does not do anything to prevent <b>corrective</b> <b>rape,</b> and women do not have much faith in the police and their investigations.|$|E

2500|$|Researchers have posed a few core {{explanations}} for the overrepresentation of LGBT youth in the general United States homeless youth population. LGBT youth {{are more likely to}} be homeless because they run away or are evicted due to family conflict surrounding their sexual orientation or behavior. This explanation is supported by a 2011 survey study of a representative Massachusetts high school sample that found that LGBT youth were no more likely to be homeless and living with their parents than non-LGBT youth. Therefore, according to the study's authors, it may not be that LGBT youth {{are more likely to be}} part of a homeless family, but rather that their higher rate of homelessness is caused by being more likely to be evicted or run away. A 2008 study using in-person interviews found that among youth who experienced homelessness for more than six months, lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth were more likely than heterosexual youth to report being verbally or physically harassed by family. In addition, LGBT youth are more likely to be homeless due to physical or sexual abuse experienced at home. [...] The Hetrick-Martin Institute showed that among homeless queer girls aged 13–15 in New York City, that 50% of them were homeless because they were fleeing familial <b>corrective</b> <b>rape.</b> [...] In the background of both these explanations is the fact that, since the family conflicts associated with LGBT youth occur relatively late in a youth's development, LGBT youth are much less likely to be placed in foster care. Those who are placed in a foster home find an unwelcoming or hostile environment, and a study on the New York City Child Welfare System reported 78% of LGBTQ youth were kicked out, or ran away from their foster home as a result. Finally, a number of other factors that lead to increased risk of homelessness in adolescents disproportionately affect LGBT youth, such as experiencing conflict at school.|$|E
5000|$|Although it {{is thought}} to be uncommon, men also become victims of <b>corrective</b> <b>rape.</b> A study {{conducted}} by OUT LGBT Well-being and the University of South Africa Centre for Applied Psychology (UCAP) showed that [...] "the percentage of black gay men who said they have experienced <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> matched that of the black lesbians who partook in the study". However, not all men admit to being victims of <b>corrective</b> <b>rape.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{psychological}} {{effects of}} <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> on victims can be detrimental. Many victims {{in countries such}} as South Africa and India where <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> is most prevalent suffer from a strong sense of insecurity and disempowerment due to strong homophobia in their communities. This homophobia can lead to both physical and psychological violence. There have been 30 lesbians who have been murdered in South Africa in the last 15 years because of their sexual orientation. However, violence against the LGBTQ community in South Africa is seldom reported. Survivors of <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> suffer from triple discrimination for being a female, black, and homosexual. This is especially true in South African townships, where <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> is common for lesbian women. <b>Corrective</b> <b>rape</b> victims may suffer from depression, anxiety, and/or post-traumatic stress disorder. [...] Due to racial and sexual discrimination in health care, victims must often deal with these issues on their own.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{political}} scientist and women's studies scholar, Susan Hawthorne, <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> is {{a hate crime}} that constitutes forced sexual activity {{with a woman who}} is gender non-conforming and/or a lesbian. The goal of <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> is to [...] "correct" [...] the victim's sexual orientation and make them heterosexual and/or to make them behave in a more gender-conforming manner. This has led to death in some cases. There are documented cases of <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ecuador, and Thailand. Eudy Simelane was a famous soccer player who played for the South Africa women's national football team and LGBT rights activist; her murder was a highly publicized instance of simultaneous <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> and lesbicide in South Africa.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> {{was coined}} in South Africa after {{well-known}} cases of corrective rapes of lesbians such as Eudy Simelane (who was also {{murdered in the}} same attack) and Zoliswa Nkonyana became public.

50|$|<b>Corrective</b> <b>rape</b> {{and other}} {{accompanying}} {{acts of violence}} can result in physical and psychological trauma, mutilation, unwanted pregnancy, and may contribute to suicide. <b>Corrective</b> <b>rape</b> is {{a major contributor to}} HIV infection in South African lesbians. In South Africa approximately 10% of lesbians are HIV positive, with <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> being the most likely cause. HIV in South Africa is pandemic, and due to homophobia {{there is a lack of}} education about sexually transmitted diseases among lesbians. Homophobic laws and discrimination in South Africa contribute to the poor quality of health care for minorities.|$|E

50|$|<b>Corrective</b> <b>rape</b> is a hate crime. However, due to {{homophobia}} and heteronormativity, {{hate crimes}} based on sexuality (as opposed to race, gender, class, age, etc.) {{are often not}} recognized by authorities. A 2000 study suggested an atmosphere supportive of hate crimes against gay men and lesbians, reactions to hate crimes by the broader community, and responses by police and justice systems contribute to <b>corrective</b> <b>rape.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Corrective</b> <b>rape</b> is also perpetrated against gay men.

50|$|Children in India {{have been}} {{speaking}} out about how their parents are sanctioning the child's sexuality by using <b>Corrective</b> <b>Rape</b> Therapy (same as <b>Corrective</b> <b>Rape).</b> <b>Corrective</b> <b>Rape</b> in India typically happens {{in order to protect}} the family name, to avoid shaming from religious communities, and to prevent abnormal perception by the surrounding community. In India, there is a general discomfort with discussing homosexuality, even if an individual identifies as homosexual. This discomfort comes from the overall negative attitude towards homosexuality and the fact is that individuals in India who identify as homosexual are victimized at a higher rate. There is also a high level of negativity towards the trans community in India. Religious commitments tend to be very strong in traditional cultures and this is where much of the tension and poor perception came from. According to statistics with the Crisis Intervention Team of LGBT Collective in Telangana, India, there have been 15 reported instances of <b>corrective</b> <b>rape</b> that have been reported in the last 5 years. In general, there has been a 902 percent increase in reported rapes in India from 1971 to 2012; however, it is estimated that 90 percent of sex crimes in the country go unreported.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Corrective</b> <b>rape</b> is {{targeted}} rape against non-heterosexuals as a punishment for violating gender roles.

50|$|<b>Corrective</b> <b>rape</b> is a {{hate crime}} in which one or more people are raped because of their {{perceived}} sexual orientation or gender identity.
