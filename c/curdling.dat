25|$|A {{small area}} in Veracruz state around La Joya {{is known for}} its smoked cheeses made with whole raw cows’ milk and are pressed after <b>curdling.</b> The cheese is often served with ham, chili peppers, epazote and slivers of jalapeños. Another kind of Veracruz cheese. marqueta, is a white cheese which is often coated with chili pepper paste. The Yucatan area also makes a type of bola cheese, {{although}} this version is harder all the way through and is filled with small, irregular holes. Another type, queso de barra, is similar to panela.|$|E
25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without <b>curdling</b> the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together with a wire whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|E
25|$|Camel milk {{cannot be}} made into butter by the {{traditional}} churning method. It can be made if it is soured first, churned, and a clarifying agent is then added. Until recently, camel milk could not {{be made into}} camel cheese because rennet was unable to coagulate the milk proteins to allow the collection of curds. Developing less wasteful uses of the milk, the FAO commissioned Professor J.P. Ramet of the École Nationale Supérieure d'Agronomie et des Industries Alimentaires, {{who was able to}} produce <b>curdling</b> by the addition of calcium phosphate and vegetable rennet. The cheese produced from this process has low levels of cholesterol and is easy to digest, even for the lactose intolerant. The sale of camel cheese is limited owing to the small output of the few dairies producing camel cheese and the absence of camel cheese in local (West African) markets. Cheese imports from countries that traditionally breed camels are difficult to obtain due to restrictions on dairy imports from these regions.|$|E

In {{addition to the}} Ottoman-era boys' school, an elementary school for girls was established in 1943. By this time, many of the inhabitants lost {{all or part of}} their lands due to debts, and concurrently, men and women from al-Birwa increasingly worked in public projects, such as road construction and the Haifa oil refinery, or in British military installations, to compensate for lost income. [...] However, the main source of income remained agriculture, and the village's principal crops were olives, wheat, barley, corn, sesame, and watermelons. In 1944/45, residents of the village owned a total of 600 cattle, 3,000 goats and 1,000 chickens. Women, particularly young women from smaller landowning families, participated alongside the men of their family in working the land, while many women from landless families drew income as seasonal workers on other village residents' lands. There were general, gender-based divisions of labor, with women collecting well water, raising livestock, <b>curdling</b> milk, transporting goods to markets in Acre and collecting herbs; men typically plowed and sowed seeds, and both men and women picked olives and harvested crops.|$|E

2500|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others.

2500|$|Carpenter's journal {{during this}} time period confuses some of the Spanish ships engaged and events. This {{indicates}} they were written soon after the battle. Carpenter wrote that the officers and crew saw the coming action as a [...] "festive occasion, from their jokes and general good spirits." [...] In a letter home to his mother, Carpenter reports he saw flashes of gunfire from Spanish guns and heard the [...] "shrill, <b>curdling</b> whirr" [...] of incoming shells. He also reported that his ship was lucky and injuries very minor during the action. Carpenter also says he rescued four firemen from heat exhaustion after they collapsed in the boiler room of the ship. On May 1, 1898 the American ships were steaming in column and the American squadron ran by the Spanish, firing at close range. Two hours later, five cross runs had been completed, and the Spanish fleet had been destroyed. Shore batteries became the targets.

2500|$|Bishop followed-up his award-winning {{science fiction}} novel with a [...] {{contemporary}} novel {{set in the}} rural American South. [...] Mary Stevenson ("Stevie") Crye is a young widow with two children struggling {{to take care of}} her family as a freelance writer. [...] Her typewriter has started to act up, automatically transcribing her nightmares and subsequently her future. The only American edition of Who Made Stevie Crye? was published in 1984 by the highly esteemed specialty publisher Arkham House under the editorship of Jim Turner. [...] This original edition, as well as the British edition, was photographically illustrated by J. K. Potter. When David Pringle chose it for inclusion in his book , he described the novel as [...] "a playful metafiction about the real and the fictitious, about the writer and his or her creation…" [...] and concluded that the novel is [...] "…a gripping and intelligent tale of the supernatural by an author who is adept at avoiding most of the clichés of the horror genre." [...] In his mixed review of the novel, Joe Sanders writes [...] "Sometimes vivid, sometimes prosaic; sometimes involving but often affectless, this is not a novel to like casually. [...] Even when it looks like standard mass-produced pop lit, it actually is nudging us toward something more disturbing and hilarious than we're comfortable imagining. [...] It finally is impressive enough to be uneasily recommended." [...] Sanders' editor, Robert A. Collins, chides the reviewer with the footnote [...] "Ignore Sanders' uneasiness, which obviously stems from his difficulty in pegging the book's genre; Stevie Crye is a marvelous book which transcends genre, as all the best of Bishop does." [...] Author Ian Watson writes [...] "Here is a humane, trickster kaleidoscope questioning a genre and a market, and fiction, and reality too – yet exquisitely spiced with human reality – and delivering the eerie chill of the occult and the illicit, <b>curdling</b> the blood but also warming the heart." ...|$|E
