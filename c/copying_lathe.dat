50|$|In 1948 Merton made an {{important}} basic {{advance in the}} art of ruling diffraction gratings. Since 1880 these had been ruled groove by groove by the method used by Rowlands. In place of this, Merton ruled a very fine helix continuously on a steel cylinder which he then opened out upon a plane gelatine-coated surface by his <b>copying</b> method. No <b>lathe</b> could, however, rule a helix free from errors of pitch and these Merton eliminated by an ingenious device. It consisted of a ‘chasing lathe’ by which he cut a secondary helix on the same cylinder with a tool mounted on a ‘Merton nut’ lined with strips of cork pressed upon the primary lathe-cut helix. Periodic errors were thus averaged and eliminated by the elasticity of the cork.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a digital {{position}} control servomechanism, which {{had previously been}} developed by the author and a co-worker, has been fitted to the saddle of a <b>copy</b> turning <b>lathe</b> so that the positioning of the servo ram controls {{the setting of the}} lathe tool relative to the main spindle axis. In this way required workpiece diameters may be preset by means of the input to the digital servo, and it is intended to further develop the system to full numerical control of the machine. The subject of the thesis is the analysis of the performance of the digital servo, both theoretically and practically, the mounting of the servo on the lathe and subsequent accuracy checks on workpieces machined according to preset commands at the input to the servo. Analysis of the performance of the digital servo involved the use of a general purpose digital computer to simmulate the non-linear response characteristics of the system, and the performance tests were carried out using a data sampling technique which is fully described. Since in operation the complete system involves the use of two position servomechanisms in series, and since no overall feedback link is provided, it was also necessary to investigate the performance of the hydraulic positioning system already fitted to the copying slide of the lathe. A series of experiments was therefore set up to measure the lag and response of the hydraulic servo under typical working conditions, in order to establish that this lag could be ignored compared to the lag in the digital system in deciding the overall accuracy of the combined equipment. This work complete with the experimental results obtained is also included...|$|R
50|$|The {{slide rest}} (as the {{earliest}} forms of carriage were known) {{can be traced}} to the fifteenth century. In 1718 the tool-supporting slide rest with a set of gears was introduced by a Russian inventor Andrey Nartov and had limited usage in the Russian industry. In the eighteenth century the slide rest was also used on French ornamental turning lathes. The suite of gun boring mills at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, in the 1780s by the Verbruggan family also had slide rests. The story has long circulated that Henry Maudslay invented it, but he did not (and never claimed so). The legend that Maudslay invented the slide rest originated with James Nasmyth, who wrote ambiguously about it in his Remarks on the Introduction of the Slide Principle, 1841; later writers misunderstood, and propagated the error. However, Maudslay did help to disseminate the idea widely. It is highly probable that he saw it when he was working at the Arsenal as a boy. In 1794, whilst he was working for Joseph Bramah, he made one, and when he had his own workshop used it extensively in the lathes he made and sold there. Coupled with the network of engineers he trained, this ensured the slide rest became widely known and <b>copied</b> by other <b>lathe</b> makers, and so diffused throughout British engineering workshops. A practical and versatile screw-cutting lathe incorporating the trio of leadscrew, change gears, and slide rest was Maudslay's most important achievement.|$|R

There he constructed many lathes of different types and {{made a number of}} innovations. Of special value was his <b>copying</b> <b>lathe</b> for the purpose of ornamental turning, which allowed the user to make ornaments with the same precision as that of handicraft work of that time.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of control {{technologies}} such as numerical control (NC and CNC) and programmable logic control (PLC), duplicate parts being milled on a milling machine could not have their contours mapped out by moving the milling cutter in a [...] "connect-the-dots" [...] ("by-the-numbers") fashion. The only ways to control {{the movement of the}} cutting tool were to dial the positions by hand using dexterous skill (with natural limits on a human's accuracy and precision) or to trace a cam, template, or model in some way, and have the cutter mimic the movement of the tracing stylus. If the milling head was mounted on a pantograph, a duplicate part could be cut (and at various scales of magnification besides 1:1) simply by tracing a template. (The template itself was usually made by a tool and die maker using toolroom methods, including milling via dialing followed by hand sculpting with files and/or die grinder points.) This was essentially the same concept as reproducing documents with a pen-equipped pantograph, but applied to the machining of hard materials such as metal, wood, or plastic. Pantograph routing, which is conceptually identical to pantograph milling, also exists (as does CNC routing). The Blanchard lathe, a <b>copying</b> <b>lathe</b> developed by Thomas Blanchard, used the same essential concept.|$|E
