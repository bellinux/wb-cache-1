40|$|AIM:To {{research}} clinical {{effect of}} two manual chopping methods for small incision extracapsular cataract extraction. METHODS: We observed 143 cases(184 eyes) with grade Ⅳ or higher taken the small incision cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. Patients were given randomly <b>knifed</b> <b>chopping</b> with closed hook(92 eyes) or double knifed chopping(92 eyes). The intra-operative posterior capsule rupture was observed and compared. At 1 d, 1 wk and 1 mo postoperatively, visual acuity, corneal edema and corneal astigmatism were observed and analyzed. RESULTS:There were 10 eyes in patients accepting <b>knifed</b> <b>chopping</b> with closed hook with intra-operative posterior capsule rupture and 1 eye in patients accepting double <b>knifed</b> <b>chopping.</b> The {{difference between the}} two groups was statistically significant. The visual acuity of patients accepting <b>knifed</b> <b>chopping</b> with closed hook(92 eyes) at 1 d postoperatively was 0. 380 ± 0. 105, and that of patients accepting double knifed chopping(92 eyes) was 0. 420 ± 0. 095; the {{difference between the two}} groups was statistically significant. The visual acuity of patients accepting <b>knifed</b> <b>chopping</b> with closed hook(84 eyes) at 1 wk postoperatively was 0. 480 ± 0. 123, and that of patients accepting double knifed chopping(86 eyes) was 0. 520 ± 0. 085; the {{difference between the two groups}} was statistically significant. The visual acuity of patients accepting <b>knifed</b> <b>chopping</b> with closed hook(60 eyes) at 1 mo postoperatively was 0. 610 ± 0. 083, and that of patients accepting double knifed chopping(52 eyes) was 0. 643 ± 0. 072; the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The differences on corneal edema and corneal astigmatism between the two methods at 1 d, 1 wk and 1 mo postoperatively were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION:The application of <b>knifed</b> <b>chopping</b> with closed hook and double <b>knifed</b> <b>chopping</b> in small incision extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation can effectively treat with cataract with grade Ⅳ or higher. The most important difference is on the capsular rupture which causes the different recover periods after the two operations.

P.L.A. soldiers, dressed in full uniform, including soft hats, are seated on both sides of the painting, providing a framing device for the performance: a woman lies on her back with her face grimacing at them while a man poised to cut her in half with a <b>chopping</b> <b>knife</b> stands by her side. This chaotic scene has many contrasts. The tension created by the performance involving knives, for example, is offset by the soldiers’ casual behavior of passing a cigarette between them during the performance.... The different layers in these paintings are metaphors for the social stratification of Chinese society, for example, between peasants, soldiers and performers.” (Chiu, 2007, P 192)“In addition to the repetition of figures, Guo’s paintings are also redolent of figures of threat and danger. The atmosphere is always crowded and claustrophobic, creating a sense of expectation that something bad is about to happen. It derives partly from Guo’s use of the P.L.A. soldiers, which we associate with war and violence, and partly from the strong intimation of debauchery and sexual deviancy.” (Chiu, 2007, P 194) ...|$|E

40|$|Crushed {{oil palm}} fruit bunches from the {{continuous}} sterilization system cause damages and bruising of the fruits, yielding high lipase enzyme reaction if no heating pre-treatment {{was carried out}} immediately. Thus, this study was proposed to acquire the free fatty acid content (FFA) release rate and to determine the mechanical properties of chopped oil palm fruit spikelets. The fruit spikelets were chopped by using two different methods, which were manually <b>chopping</b> using a <b>knife</b> blade and utilizing a fabricated chopper blade. Damages obtained from the manually <b>chopped</b> using the <b>knife</b> blade were classified into two categories, which were minor and major damage. The chopper blade was fixed on the Instron Machine to obtain its mechanical properties, such as rupture force, deformation at rupture, hardness and energy at the break of the fruit spikelets. The chopped fruit spikelets were stored at different storage periods ranging between 0 hr to 2 hr at room temperature. Extraction of palm oil was extracted using the Soxhlet extractor and the FFA content of the palm oil was determined through titration method. Results showed that the mean rupture force, deformation at rupture, hardness and energy at break required when chopping the fruit spikelets were 2781 N, 45. 53 mm, 61. 02 N/mm and 36. 71 J respectively. The development of FFA content was highly influenced by the damaged area of the fruits {{and the length of}} storage periods.

50|$|A full tang {{knife or}} sword {{generally}} allows for increased force leveraged through the handle against {{the resistance of}} material being cut by the blade, an advantage when used against harder materials or when the blade begins to dull. A full tang also increases the amount of stock metal in {{the handle of the}} tool which can be beneficial in altering the balance point of the tool since the blade of a knife or sword is often quite heavy compared to the handle. Adding weight to the handle of a knife or sword to offset the weight of the blade moves the rotational balance point back toward the hand where it can be more easily manipulated to great effect, making for a nimble, agile tool. In general, a forward-balanced blade excels at chopping but sacrifices agility and ease of manipulation; a centre or rear-balanced blade excels at agility but sacrifices raw <b>chopping</b> power. <b>Knives</b> and swords intended for specific purposes will usually incorporate whichever design is most suited to how the tool will be handled for that specific purpose.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the occurrence of microbiological contamination of kitchen utensils and environments of food service operations at university located in Seoul, Korea. Methods: We collected swab samples from the surfaces of <b>knives,</b> <b>chopping</b> boards, floors, and drains, as well as drinking water and airborne bacteria samples from 20 food service operations. Three bacterial indicators and five food poisoning bacteria were measured quantitatively and qualitatively, respectively. We used selective culture media and the PCR assay targeting 16 S rRNA gene for the microbiological analysis. Results: We detected bacterial indicators on <b>knives</b> or <b>chopping</b> boards in eight different food service operations and, three food service operations(I, M, and O) showed more than 3 log colony forming units(CFU) / 100 cm 2 on their knives, significantly higher than the others. The levels of bacterial indicators on the floors and drains in the cooking areas were much higher than those on the cooking utensils. S. aureus was detected on 10 floors and 8 drains.

40|$|Very {{little is}} known {{at the present time}} about the {{importance}} of the germ Arcobacter spp. It can cause food-borne infections in humans and has been detected to a growing degree in recent years in raw poultry meat and pork. For a long time the bacterium was classified as safe; only recently have more and more scientists turned their attention to this issue on the international level. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has undertaken a risk assessment of food contaminated with Arcobacter spp. This pathogen plays a role particularly in the case of poultry meat. However, the available data are not robust because of the non-standardised test methods used. This means that further studies are needed on the for-mation and transmission pathways in order to be able to estimate the actual risk presented by this bacterium. It is only since the 1990 s that this bacterium, which was previously classified as a Campylo-bacter, has been assigned to the Arcobacter spp. strain. Some sub-groups cause gastroin-testinal disorders with stomach cramps and diarrhoea in humans. In the literature various food-borne infections have been described that were caused by Arcobacter spp. Some au-thors attribute to the bacterium a pathogenic potential similar to that of Campylobacter. Comparable studies in various countries have shown that fresh poultry is particularly suscep-tible to attack by this pathogenic microorganism. As, at the present time, it is not possible to definitively evaluate how harmful this bacterium is for humans, BfR advises consumers - along the lines of precautionary consumer protection - to comply with the rules of kitchen hygiene: cook meat through (at least 10 minutes at 70 °C) and thoroughly wash hands, <b>knives,</b> <b>chopping</b> boards, work surfaces in order to avoid the cross contamination of other food...|$|R
40|$|SummaryFood borne {{pathogens}} {{are major}} causes of deaths, illnesses {{and billions of}} dollars of expenses. The burden of food borne illness is worsened by the ever increasing rate of antimicrobial resistance microbes. Shigella, a bacterial pathogen associated with food, is reported to account for higher prevalence rates of food borne illness in different settings. A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 10 to June 30, 2013, at the butcher houses of Gondar town in the Northwest of Ethiopia to assess the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Shigella. Cattle raw meat and swab samples from selected critical control points, including <b>knives,</b> <b>chopping</b> boards, and the hands and noses of butchers, were collected and analyzed. The identification of Shigella was carried out using colony characteristics, the Gram reaction, and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Kirby–Bauer disc diffusion method. The overall hygienic status of the butcher shops was also assessed using a checklist. An observational analysis revealed that the sanitary condition of the butcher shops and their premises was poor. Of 306 samples screened, 10. 5 % were positive for Shigella. Approximately 7. 4 % of meat samples and 10. 2 % of swab samples were contaminated with Shigella. Out of the total Shigella isolates, 90. 6 %, 46. 9 %, 18. 8 % and 9. 4 % were resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone and tetracycline, respectively. A multidrug resistance pattern was recorded in 27. 8 % of the isolates. In conclusion, the safety of meat sold at Gondar butchers houses was poor. The identified Shigella isolates showed high levels of drug resistance and multidrug resistance patterns for commonly used antimicrobials in veterinary and human medicine. Practicing wise use of antimicrobials and strict sanitary interventions at different critical control points is strongly recommended, in addition to further in-depth studies to prevent unprecedented consequences from shigellosis...|$|R
