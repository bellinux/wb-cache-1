Unfortunately, such painstaking work and advanced skill is {{out of reach for}} casual photographers. In addition, for professional photographers, it is important to improve workflow efficiency. The goal of our work is to allow users to achieve a faithful viewpoint for repho-tography and a particular appearance with ease and speed. To this end, we analyze and transfer properties of <b>a</b> model <b>photo</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new <b>photo.</b> In particular, we trans-fer the viewpoint of <b>a</b> reference <b>photo</b> <b>to</b> enable rephotography.
