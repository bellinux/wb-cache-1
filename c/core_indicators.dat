40|$|The history {{behind the}} {{evolution}} of the American postsecondary education has imitated the European system {{with the exception of the}} community college. The community college strives to meet the needs of all students with an enrollment open door policy. This study examined relationships between student demographics and the achievement of <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> by Ohio community colleges. The <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> measure technical skill attainment; credential, certificate, or degree achievement; student retention or transfer; student placement; and nontraditional participation and completion. Using archived data from 2007 - 2013 required by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, a linear mixed model analysis was performed discovering significant relationships between the <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> and other demographic factors such as, gender, race, students who meet the definition of students with disabilities, students who are economically disadvantaged, students who are displaced homemakers, students with limited English proficiency, and those students pursuing nontraditional careers for their gender. The linear mixed model was used due to the fixed effects of the student demographics, and the Ohio community colleges as random factors. The cohort years comprised the repeated measure. The results of the LMM indicated that the factor of gender was significant under two of the <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> with positive impact towards achieving the target goal by the community college. Race was found significant under all <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> with positive impact. Students meetings the definition of disabilities, displaced homemakers, and those students seeking nontraditional career paths each had significance under one <b>core</b> performance <b>indicator.</b> Students meeting the definition of economically disadvantaged were found significant under three different <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators</b> with positive impact. Single parent status negatively impacted the achievement of the <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators.</b> Students with limited English proficiency were found to be significant twice under different <b>core</b> performance <b>indicators,</b> once with positive impact and once with negative impact. Understanding the relationships of the effects may enable Ohio community colleges to better use their limited resources based on the needs of the students attending each statewide location.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of inflationary pressures in Colombia has faced two important {{challenges in the}} present decade. The first one occurred in 2006 and consisted of detecting an overheating economy {{in the midst of}} fast growing investment and increasing measured productivity. The second challenge took place in 2007 - 2008, when the economy was hit by a number of "supply" shocks and <b>core</b> inflation <b>indicators</b> sent diverging signals about the transmission of those shocks to macroeconomic inflation. An evaluation of the first episode shows that traditional indicators of productivity and unit labor costs were not sufficient to identify "supply" and "demand" movements. Thus, policymakers had to rely on a wider array of variables to gauge the state of the economy. Regarding the second episode, an evaluation of <b>core</b> inflation <b>indicators</b> according to standard criteria suggests that no particular measure seems to be clearly superior to the others. Hence, the {{assessment of}} inflationary pressures should not rely only on one or few <b>core</b> inflation <b>indicators,</b> since some signals could be picked by some measures and not by others. Moreover, this result suggests that the analysis of core inflation measures must be complemented with a careful examination of the persistence of the shocks and a close monitoring of their impact on inflation expectations. It is found that the latter are formed on the basis of past inflation, but that the inflation target also plays a role. In addition, inflation expectations partially move with "supply" shocks, an outcome that reflects a degree of credibility of monetary policy. <b>Core</b> Inflation <b>Indicators,</b> Inflation Expectations, Monetary Policy.

5000|$|GDP {{per capita}} is a rough measure of average living {{standards}} or economic well-being {{and is one}} of the <b>core</b> <b>indicators</b> of economic performance. (OECD 2008, 14) GDP is, for this purpose, only a very rough measure. Maximizing GDP, in principle, also allows maximizing capital usage. For this reason GDP is systematically biased in favour of capital intensive production at the expense of knowledge and labour-intensive production. The use of capital in the GDP-measure is considered to be as valuable as the production’s ability to pay taxes, profits and labor compensation. The bias of the GDP is actually the difference between the GDP and the producer income. (Saari 2011,10,16) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates if the (OLS-scaled) first {{principal}} component (PC 1), extracted from standardized yearly rates of change of basic {{items of the}} CPI, represents a reasonable option for a <b>core</b> inflation <b>indicator.</b> The evaluation is carried out by (i) confronting alternative linear transformations of the original variables; (ii) analyzing the impact of stacking lagged variables to the original database; and (iii) exploring {{the contents of the}} remaining {{principal component}}s. An orthogonal factor model framework will also be introduced so as to fully reproduce any variable that can be expressed as a linear combination of the original input variables, such as, in this case, the overall inflation rate. The model incorporates the following properties: (i) the results are not conditional on the eigenvectors length; (ii) the variance of the CPI accounted for by each component is unique, and (iii) the outcome is equivalent to an OLS regression between the CPI and the PC 1. Along with empirical evidence for the Portuguese case, it will be claimed that the above-mentioned (OLS-scaled) PC 1 does capture the general movement of the overall inflation rate, however, no OLS regression would have to be implemented if the <b>core</b> <b>indicator</b> is fully aligned with the orthogonal factor model. ...|$|R

40|$|More {{resources}} are being defined as critical, {{which can be}} attributed to the linear economy of ‘take, make and dispose’. An alternative is to implement the circular economy (CE) which could reduce several negative effects, among other things resource depletion. The aim of this thesis is to identify what current sustainability indicators are lacking to assess a resource with the CE concept. This is done by developing CE <b>core</b> <b>indicators,</b> which then are compared with sustainability indicators. The life cycle of rare earth elements (REE) is used as a case study to validate the CE <b>core</b> <b>indicators.</b> To achieve this literature studies and comparative analysis will be performed. Existing definitions and indicators of CE were studied to compile a complete set of <b>core</b> <b>indicators.</b> These compiled CE <b>core</b> <b>indicators</b> were then compared with adapted United Nation (UN) sustainability indicators. The UN indicators were chosen after analysing several different sustainability indicator system and their compatibility with the resource perspective. The main differences between the UN indicators and CE <b>core</b> <b>indicators</b> is that the UN indicators does not include economic aspects such as market diversity and social aspects such as consumption behaviour. However, the UN indicator system includes transportation and governance that could be beneficial to include into the CE concept. The economic viability to perform the CE analysis and non-existing CE indicators for companies and countries were identified as two barriers that could hinder development and efficient use of a CE indicator system. A way to increase the economic viability is to use already generated data for the CE indicator analysis, though the economical aspect has to be studied further. The non-existing CE indicators for companies and countries are counted as a barrier due to the risk of sub-optimisation of one resource. Additionally, the CE indicator results could be misinterpreted to blame a few for the problems of the resource instead of using the results to improve all parts of the life cycle. Further research is also needed to investigate how, or even if, social aspects such as culture and society could be indicated within a CE indicator system. In conclusion, the UN indicator system could be a good baseline to develop a CE indicator system for a resource though further research is needed. ...|$|E
