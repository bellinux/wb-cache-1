5|$|During {{his primary}} victories, McGovern used an {{approach}} that stressed grassroots-level organization while bypassing conventional campaign techniques and traditional party power centers. He <b>capitalized</b> <b>on</b> support from anti-war activists and reform liberals; thousands of students engaged in door-to-door campaigning for him. He benefited by the eight primaries he won being those the press focused on the most; he showed electoral weakness in the South and industrial Midwest, and actually received fewer primary votes overall than Humphrey and had only a modest edge over Wallace.|$|E

With 9:29 remaining, Virginia Tech's offense entered the game.

5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Virginia Tech {{searching for a}} way to answer Georgia's {{previous}} two scores and quash the momentum Georgia had picked up. On the third play of the quarter, however, Virginia Tech quarterback Sean Glennon threw an interception to Georgia's Tony Taylor. Beginning on their own 35-yard line, Georgia <b>capitalized</b> <b>on</b> the mistake quickly, courtesy of a 15-yard personal foul penalty and a 41-yard completion from Stafford to Milner. Georgia, hoping to tie the time, attempted and completed a two-point conversion. The resulting scores tied the game at 21–21 with 12:39 remaining in the game.|$|E
