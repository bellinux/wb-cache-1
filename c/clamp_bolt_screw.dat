5000|$|One major {{challenge}} was pulling {{all of the}} Wright R-3350-23 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines out of already completed B-29s and modifying them to R-3350-23A [...] "war engine" [...] standard. This entailed disassembling and rebuilding the engines with added baffles to accelerate the airflow over the cylinders, new exhaust valves with improved metallurgy, new rocker arms (drilled with small holes, to allow better oil flow, rather than solid) and modified nose casings and engine sumps, again to improve oil flow. In sub-zero temperatures the work was arduous, especially {{when it came to}} struggling with stiff and brittle fuel and oil lines and hard-to-reach <b>clamps,</b> <b>bolts</b> and <b>screws.</b>|$|R

30|$|A {{mechanical}} study {{investigating the}} use of two different methods (grub and <b>bolt</b> <b>screws)</b> to secure external fixation half pins to circular frames. A four part experiment: (1) Grub and <b>bolt</b> <b>screws</b> were used to secure half pins in Taylor Spatial frames. Loosening torques were measured using a calibrated torque wrench. (2) Using universal testing machine (UTM), axial loading was applied to establish thresholds for loosening in grub and <b>bolt</b> <b>screw</b> constructs. (3) We established the application torque to produce failure at the head–driver interface using these two methods. (4) Grub and <b>bolt</b> <b>screw</b> constructs were created controlling torque. Using UTM, axial loading was applied to establish thresholds for loosening. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS v 20.0. 0. (1) Higher torque is employed when bolt rather than grub screws is used to secure half pins on Rancho cubes (p <  0.05). (2) Loading threshold for loosening is higher in <b>bolt</b> <b>screw</b> constructs when the torque applied to secure the constructs is not controlled (p <  0.05). (3) Torque required for failure at the head–driver interface was 5.3  Nm for grub screws and 9.9  Nm for bolts. (4) Loading threshold for loosening is higher in grub screw constructs when the same torque was applied to secure them (p <  0.05). <b>Bolt</b> <b>screws</b> can be employed to secure the half pin–frame interface. They offer good stability and reduce failure at the head–driver interface. Further {{research is needed to}} determine the mechanical properties of such constructs in vivo.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Despite {{being an}} {{important}} element to connect the major building materials in a steel bridge, bolt joints have not been sufficiently studied in terms of each defect generated in them. Among defects in bolt joints of steel bridges currently in public use, the most frequently occurring problem is the insufficient axial <b>bolt</b> <b>clamping</b> force. To measure sliding load caused by change in axial <b>bolt</b> <b>clamping</b> force, a test sample of H-beam applied with pure bending was created and static tests were administered. Based on the axial <b>bolt</b> <b>clamping</b> force of the test sample where the designed axial <b>bolt</b> <b>clamping</b> force is 100 %, tests were carried out with different axial <b>bolt</b> <b>clamping</b> forces of 75 %, 50 % and 25 %.
