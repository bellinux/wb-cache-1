40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Environment and Planning D - Society & Space [© SAGE Publications]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] this paper we explore the scaling of resilience policy and practice not as an effect upon infrastructure but as enacted through infrastructure. Drawing on Foucault’s topological analyses of governmental power, especially his elaboration of its coeval centripetal and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>flows,</b> we argue that understanding the scaling of resilience policy and practice involves acknowledging its infrastructural composition. We examine this infrastructural scaling through an empirical analysis of UK resilience policy and practice, as recounted by those working across multiple organizations involved in planning for, and coping with, aleatory events. This reveals how the neoliberal decentralizing refrain, expressed in resilience policy and its critique, is both sustained and displaced by interwoven circulatory mechanisms of obstruction, filtration, and acceleration. Together these infrastructural flows amount to ‘fractionally coherent’ scalings that not only centralize governmental power but are constitutive of governmental centres. Our analyses of infrastructural scaling suggest that resiliency policy and practice is far less decentralized, or localized, than others have suggested, with both centripetal and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>flows</b> of power resulting from a composite of infrastructural circulatory mechanisms that can variously scale political agency in relation to aleatory events...|$|R

40|$|The general {{stability}} {{criteria of}} inviscid Taylor-Couette flows with angular velocity Ω(r) are obtained analytically. First, a necessary instability criterion for <b>centrifugal</b> <b>flows</b> is derived as ξ'(Ω-Ω_s) < 0 (or ξ'/(Ω-Ω_s) < 0) {{somewhere in the}} flow field, where ξ is the vorticitiy of profile and Ω_s is the angular velocity at the inflection point ξ'= 0. Second, a criterion for stability is found as -(μ_ 1 + 1 /r_ 2) <f(r) =ξ'/Ω-Ω_s< 0, where μ_ 1 is the smallest eigenvalue. The new criteria are the analogues of the criteria for parallel flows, which are special cases of Arnol'd's nonlinear criteria. Specifically, Pedley's cirterion is {{proved to be an}} special case of Rayleigh's criterion. Moreover, the criteria for parallel flows can also be derived from those for the rotating flows. These results extend the previous theorems and would intrigue future research on the mechanism of hydrodynamic instability.

50|$|A turboexpander, also {{referred}} to as a turbo-expander or an expansion turbine, is a <b>centrifugal</b> or axial <b>flow</b> turbine through which a high pressure gas is expanded to produce work that is often used to drive a compressor or generator.|$|R
50|$|Turbomachines {{are also}} {{categorized}} {{according to the}} type of flow. When the flow is parallel to the axis of rotation, they are called axial flow machines, and when flow is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, they are referred to as radial (or <b>centrifugal)</b> <b>flow</b> machines. There is also a third category, called mixed flow machines, where both radial and axial flow velocity components are present.|$|E
50|$|The Type 541 {{replaced}} its predecessors' Rolls-Royce Nene <b>centrifugal</b> <b>flow</b> {{turbojet engine}} with the axial-flow Rolls-Royce AJ.65 turbojet engine, {{which became the}} famed Avon series. The fuselage, which {{had been given a}} cross section suitable for the Nene engine, was not redesigned for the narrower AJ.65 and Avon engines, and retained a somewhat portly appearance. It was also equipped with a tricycle undercarriage arrangement. A pair of Type 541 prototypes were produced; the first of these prototypes made its maiden flight in 1951 and the second during the following year.|$|E

50|$|Council of Ministers {{directive}} No. 1886-696 {{called for}} development of 140 as a tactical reconnaissance aircraft powered by two Klimov VK-1 <b>centrifugal</b> <b>flow</b> turbo-jets. During the design work for the '140-R' the deficiencies highlighted by flight testing of the '140' were addressed {{as well as the}} addition of wingtip-mounted fuel tanks and new nacelles for the VK-1 engines, and the fitting of DT-V1 and DT-N1 turrets, replacing those of the '140', armed with 2 × 23mm cannon each. Flight testing of '140-R' commenced on 20 October at a specially built airfield near the GOZ-1 factory at Borki, (the German workers were not admitted to Tyoplyy Stan for security reasons), where four flights were carried out, all of which suffered from severe vibration of the wings.|$|E
50|$|The Venom entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force (RAF), {{where it was}} used as a single-seat {{fighter-bomber}} and two-seat night fighter. A dedicated model for aerial reconnaissance was also operated by the Swiss Air Force. The Venom functioned as an interim stage between the first generation of British jet fighters - straight-wing aircraft powered by <b>centrifugal</b> <b>flow</b> engines such as the Gloster Meteor and the Vampire - and later swept wing, axial flow-engined combat aircraft, such as the Hawker Hunter and de Havilland Sea Vixen. Accordingly, the type had a relatively short service life in the RAF, being withdrawn from frontline operations by the service in 1962 {{as a result of the}} introduction of more capable designs. However, it was used in combat during the Suez Crisis, the Malayan Emergency, and the Aden Emergency.|$|E

In 1958 it was discovered {{during a visit to}} Beijing by Whitney Straight, then deputy chairman of Rolls-Royce, that this engine had been copied without license to power the MiG-15 'Fagot', first as the RD-45, and after initial problems of metallurgy forced the Soviet engineers to develop a slightly redesigned (and metallurgically closer) copy, the engine had then entered production as the Klimov VK-1 (Rolls-Royce later attempted to claim £207m in license fees, without success).|$|E

5000|$|In the mid 1970s the [...] "MUST" [...] {{designation}} was applied, (Medical Unit, Self Contained, Transportable). During the [...] "Cold War", {{with the}} possible conflict with the Warsaw Pact, active duty MUST units would be staffed by all the basic personnel necessary (Medics, X-Ray Techs, Pharmacist, Cooks, Clerks etc.) Doctors, Nurses and Specialist would be mobilized and mate up with the unit in the Field. The Unit would be flown to West Germany, withdraw Pre-positioned complete Hospital MUST equipment and Military Vehicles from warehouses and then deploy. It contained all necessary functions to provide care for 200 beds, including 2 intensive care units, 8 medical wards, emergency room, 4 operating rooms, orthopedic room, laboratory, X-ray, pharmacy and the Unit's transport vehicles. It consisted of hard containers, which would be transported to the designated site, then the wheels would be removed and then expanded. They housed the operating rooms, laboratory, X-ray, and pharmacy. Inflatable shelters were used to provide double wall insulated areas for the patient care areas of the hospital. These [...] "inflatables" [...] required a power system called a Utility Pack (also known as a U-Pack or power station) to provide utility services, Heat, Cooling, Inflation, Hot Water, Filtered Air from CBR Contaminants. The Utility Pack (Power Plant, Utility, Gas Turbine Engine Driven - Libby Welding Co. Model LPU-71, Airesearch Model PPU85-5, AmerTech Co. Model APP-1, or Hollingsworth Model JHTWX10/96), powered by a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>flow</b> gas turbine engine, provided electricity (60 Hz AC, 400 Hz AC, and 24vdc). At 250 beds the hospital required 8 U-Packs. Each consumed 30 gallons of jet fuel per hour. After several years of using inflatables they were abandoned in the mid 1980s, {{largely due to the}} weight of the inflatables, and the amount of fuel required just to keep the tents from collapsing.|$|E
