5|$|<b>Coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> {{also known}} as ischemic heart disease, is caused by {{atherosclerosis}} – a build-up of plaque along the inner walls of the arteries which narrows them, reducing the {{blood flow to the}} heart. A stable plaque may cause chest pain (angina) or breathlessness during exercise or at rest, or no symptoms at all. A ruptured plaque can block a blood vessel and lead to ischaemia of the heart muscle, causing unstable angina or a heart attack. In the worst case this may cause cardiac arrest, a sudden and utter loss of output from the heart. Obesity, high blood pressure, uncontrolled diabetes, smoking and high cholesterol can all increase the risk of developing atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.|$|E
25|$|Clinically, given {{enlargement}} of the arteries for decades, symptomatic atherosclerosis is typically associated with men in their 40s and women in their 50s to 60s. Sub-clinically, the disease begins to appear in childhood, and rarely is already present at birth. Noticeable signs can begin developing at puberty. Though symptoms are rarely exhibited in children, early screening of children for cardiovascular diseases could be beneficial to both the child and his/her relatives. While <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> more prevalent in men than women, atherosclerosis of the cerebral arteries and strokes equally affect both sexes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> a {{condition}} in which the blood vessels to the heart become clogged. It often leads to heart attacks {{and is one of the}} leading causes of death in the United States. Beginning in the mid-1960s, the leading treatment consisted of invasive bypass surgery, in which a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body is grafted onto the coronary artery, forming a detour around the afflicted region. Due to the high cost and risk of this procedure, an alternative was in high demand. In 1977, Andreas Gruentzig performed the first successful percutaneous coronary angioplasty. In this procedure, a catheter attached to a small balloon is inserted into the afflicted artery. The balloon is subsequently expanded, compressing the accumulated plaque to allow increased blood flow. This was a substantial improvement over bypass surgery in terms of invasiveness, but unfortunately restenosis, a recurrence of arterial clogging, occurred in nearly 50% of patients after the balloon was removed.|$|E
5000|$|The term can {{indicate}} {{either a}} condition existing simultaneously but independently with another condition or a related medical condition. The latter {{sense of the}} term causes some overlap with the concept of complications. For example, in longstanding diabetes mellitus, the extent to which <b>coronary</b> <b>artery</b> <b>disease</b> <b>is</b> an independent comorbidity versus a diabetic complication is not easy to measure, because both diseases are quite multivariate and there are likely aspects of both simultaneity and consequence. The same is true of intercurrent diseases in pregnancy. In other examples, the true independence or relation is not ascertainable because syndromes and associations are often identified long before pathogenetic commonalities are confirmed (and, in some examples, before they are even hypothesized). In psychiatric diagnoses it has been argued in part that this [...] "'use of imprecise language may lead to correspondingly imprecise thinking', and this usage of the term 'comorbidity' should probably be avoided." [...] However, in many medical examples, such as comorbid diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease, it makes little difference which word is used, as long as the medical complexity is duly recognized and addressed.|$|E
