5|$|The Witness {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, who {{praised the}} difficult but surmountable puzzles and the game's art and setting. Within {{a week of}} release, the game had sold over 100,000 copies, which was about as many copies as Braid had done {{within a year of}} its release, nearly recouping all of the development <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
5|$|The <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> project {{ended at}} NOK26,651,900, of which NOK22.0 million {{was for the}} railway. This total {{included}} NOK2.3 million for a power station and NOK1.2 million for a ferry quay at Flåm. The largest cost was for earthwork, which ended at NOK9.1 million; other major costs were NOK2.4 million for rolling stock, NOK1.6 million for stations, NOK1.2 for tracks, NOK1.5 million for snow protection and NOK675,000 for electrification.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} {{origin of}} costs for society is the long-term care by {{health care professionals}} and particularly institutionalisation, which corresponds to 2/3 of the total costs for society.

Chidsey also apologized on behalf of the company for the comments made about the pickers and the behavior of Grover and Silversmith. Additionally, the company agreed to provide a ½¢ per pound payment to the CIW to cover payroll taxes and administrative <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tomato growers.|$|E
5|$|Total <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} were $40,000 at occupation with {{a need for}} approximately an additional $17,000 to finish and furnish the building. The building was first used for classrooms, a library, parlors, recitation rooms, and some physical education in the attic. Also {{in the early years}} the structure housed the chapel services of the school, and some temporary accommodations for students.|$|E
5|$|After {{allegations}} that the design contractor had inflated <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tunnel {{in order to avoid}} sharing the job with an outside tunneling contractor, the long tunnel concept was revived in April 2006. The allegations led to calls for an outside cost estimate to determine more realistic tunnel costs. On May 15, 2006, Virginia Transportation Secretary Pierce R. Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The panel had about two months to evaluate options for completing the line through Tysons Corner, with the results presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E

5|$|At the time, HBO {{made their}} {{commitments}} {{for only one}} year at a time, a third season would have meant opening up a new two-season book in Daniel Knauf's six-year plan, including {{the introduction of new}} storylines for current and new characters, and further clarification and elaboration on the show's mythology. HBO announced that the show had been cancelled on May 11, 2005. HBO's president Chris Albrecht said the network would have considered otherwise if the producers had been willing to lower the price of an episode to US$2million; but the running <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sizable cast, the all-on-location shooting and the number of episodes per season were too enormous for them.|$|E
5|$|Despite his protests, Sebree did {{act as the}} {{governor}} of the territory. During his administration, the United States Congress approved $35,000 to pay off debts related to construction <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> naval station, and planning began {{for the construction of a}} lighthouse on Aunu'u. The Fita Fita Guard, the local militia that Tilley had organized, continued its training, and Sebree arranged to train some members of the force as a military-style brass band. Sebree also attempted to improve local agriculture and even petitioned the Department of Agriculture for assistance, but was turned down.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{it was decided}} to upgrade the Røa and Sognsvann Lines to metro standard. This would allow them to use T1000 stock. Twelve T2000 were ordered in 1991, and would be {{sufficient}} to operate the services on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines, that would retain an overhead wire. The development <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> T2000 were in part subsidized by the government, as the high-tech product from Strømmens Verksted (by then part of the ABB Group) and AEG was seen as a future export product. The trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995. The same year, the metro started operating all services through the city center, connecting the western and eastern networks.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{set up the}} Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA) on January 10, 1935. Eventually, on September 18, 1937, {{with the}} help of Oklahoma Representative Wesley E. Disney, Senator Elmer Thomas and {{engineer}} W. R. Holway, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved $20 million in funding through the New Deal's Public Works Administration for the dam. The higher cost for the dam was attributed to a project that was approved for additional purposes, including hydroelectric power generation and recreation. Additional <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dam were covered by the state government and by GRDA municipal bond auctions which appropriated or raised $11 million. Disney had pushed much of the legislation for the dam, comparing the higher electric utility rates in Oklahoma compared to other states. Senator Thomas helped appropriate additional state and public funding for the dam while also being instrumental in its legislation.|$|E
5|$|The 1956 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the VII Olympic Winter Games (French: Les VIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver) (Italian: VII Giochi olimpici invernali), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. This celebration of the Games was held from 26 January to 5 February 1956. Cortina, which had {{originally}} been awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics, beat out Montreal, Colorado Springs and Lake Placid {{for the right to}} host the 1956 Games. The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues were within walking distance of each other. The organising committee received financial support from the Italian government for infrastructure improvements, {{but the rest of the}} <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Games had to be privately financed. Consequently, the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship for funding.|$|E

The most expensive Summer Games are London 2012 at USD 15 billion and the most expensive Winter Games are Sochi 2014 at USD 21.9 billion. Costs per athlete is on average USD 0.6 million for the Summer Games and USD 1.3 million for the Winter Games. For London 2012, cost per athlete was USD 1.4 million; for Sochi 2014, USD 7.9 million.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{economy grew}} {{considerably}} {{during the war}} despite the concurrent rise of war expenditure {{to pay for the}} expansion of the military and the air training scheme. Expenditure on the war grew from £1,793,367 in the financial year 1940–41 to £5,334,701 in 1943–44—total Southern Rhodesian expenditure on the air training scheme was £11,215,522. These sums, while tiny compared to those incurred by larger nations, were enormous when scaled against the white population of less than 70,000 that accounted for most of the colony's economic output. Annual <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> air training scheme alone far exceeded the pre-war national budget.|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} {{impetus for}} the Pennsylvanian was the discontinuance of the National Limited, a New YorkKansas City train which had provided service over the corridor. The Pennsylvanian began on April 27, 1980, as a state-supported daylight train between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with connecting service to New York via the Philadelphian (a Clocker) westbound and the Montrealer eastbound. At the time the Pennsylvanian was inaugurated, the Broadway Limited was departing Pittsburgh at an inconvenient early morning hour. The new train ran with Amfleet equipment, including a cafe car. Pennsylvania agreed to pay 20% of the train's <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first year, or $580,000, with the state and Amtrak eventually splitting the costs 50/50 by the third year.|$|E
5|$|The musical began previews at Broadway's Circle in the Square Theatre on March 27, 2015, with an {{official}} opening on April 19, 2015. Gold directed {{the show on}} Broadway, with the same production team as the Off-Broadway production, including Zinn, Mefford and Stanton. The Off-Broadway cast reprised their roles on Broadway, except for the actors playing Medium Alison, John and Christian Bechdel. In December 2015, eight months after opening on Broadway, the show recouped its capitalization and began to make a profit. <b>Costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show were relatively low due to a small cast and orchestra. The production closed on September 10, 2016, after 26 previews and 582 regular performances.|$|E
5|$|Widely {{divergent}} <b>costs</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{project were}} discussed. The original estimate was £140,000 if the railway was built, and £200,000 if the tunnel was built. Opponents suggested the {{cost would be}} nearer £700,000, and John Rennie estimated the tunnel line would cost £440,790 in 1809. Opponents argued that the real intent was to improve the water supply for the Basingstoke Canal or to line the pockets of George Hollis, {{the owner of the}} Itchen Navigation. There was considerable interest in the scheme, as 1,244 shares of £100 had been subscribed by early 1809, but with opposition from land and mill owners, and Rennie's report indicating much higher costs, the project was dropped.|$|E
