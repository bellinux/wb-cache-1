Concomitant with the more obvious technological changes is a subtler one, an attitude, long-growing, which considers children to be not diminutive adults but individuals who are physically, intellectually and emotionally different from their elders. This attitude is {{reflected in the}} attempt to furnish children’s rooms in both school and public libraries with dignity and spirit. Recognition of differences between adults and children does not condemn each to isolation. Although a children’s area serves specifically the library needs of childhood, it also provides a link, both physical and visual, between childhood and the beckoning world of adulthood. Although children constitute the largest audience in the children’s area, adult use by those seeking its services for work with children or for personal needs is becoming an increasingly important factor, particularly in public libraries. Gone, for example, are the picture book characters floating flamboyantly in great murals across the room, creating a <b>confining</b> <b>atmosphere</b> and appealing only to the youngest children. Some librarians complain that we have replaced gewgaws with sterility and have robbed our children’s rooms of the individual objects that related the world of books to other cultural media. Perhaps this is occasionally true. But the real individual personality of a library is created only after the original tone is established, and more by the staff and books than by objets d‘art...|$|R

Several minutes were consumed in silent admiration before they noticed two very singular and unusual facts about this valley. One {{was that it was}} lighted from some unseen source; for no sun or moon was in the arched blue sky, although every object was flooded with a clear and perfect light. The second and even more singular fact was the absence of any inhabitant of this splendid place.

60|$|I first {{observed}} an alteration in {{his conduct}} while rubbing in the phosphorus {{on the paper}} in my last attempt. As I rubbed, he ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl; but I was too greatly excited {{at the time to}} pay much attention to the circumstance. Soon afterward, it will be remembered, I threw myself on the mattress, and fell into a species of lethargy. Presently I became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my ears, and discovered it to proceed from Tiger, who was panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement, his eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom. I spoke to him, when he replied with a low growl, and then remained quiet. Presently I relapsed into my stupor, from which I was again awakened in a similar manner. This was repeated three or four times, until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a degree of fear, that I became fully aroused. He was now lying close by the door of the box, snarling fearfully, although in a kind of undertone, and grinding his teeth as if strongly convulsed. I had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the <b>confined</b> <b>atmosphere</b> of the hold had driven him mad, and I was at a loss what course to pursue. I could not endure the thought of killing him, yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety. I could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly animosity, and I expected every instant that he would attack me. At last I could endure my terrible situation no longer, and determined to make my way from the box at all hazards, and dispatch him, if his opposition should render it necessary for me to do so. To get out, I had to pass directly over his body, and he already seemed to anticipate my design--missing himself upon his fore-legs (as I perceived by the altered position of his eyes), and displayed the whole of his white fangs, which were easily discernible. I took the remains of the ham-skin, and the bottle containing the liqueur, and secured them about my person, together with a large carving-knife which Augustus had left me--then, folding my cloak around me as closely as possible, I made a movement toward the mouth of the box. No sooner did I do this, than the dog sprang with a loud growl toward my throat. The whole weight of his body struck me on the right shoulder, and I fell violently to the left, while the enraged animal passed entirely over me. I had fallen upon my knees, with my head buried among the blankets, and these protected me from a second furious assault, during which I felt the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck--yet, luckily, without being able to penetrate all the folds. I was now beneath the dog, and a few moments would place me completely in his power. Despair gave me strength, and I rose boldly up, shaking him from me by main force, and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress. These I now threw over him, and before he could extricate himself, I had got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit. In this struggle, however, I had been forced to drop the morsel of ham-skin, and I now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to a single gill of liqueur. As this reflection crossed my mind, I felt myself actuated by one of those fits of perverseness which might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances, and, raising the bottle to my lips, I drained it to the last drop, and dashed it furiously upon the floor.|$|E

In modern fire science, the unburned patches are called protected areas. The firefighters' bodies protected these areas by shielding from the intense thermal radiation, by keeping out hot gases, and absorbing heat. All of these factors kept the grass and forest litter unburned where they were lying.

30|$|During the night, at 21 : 00 – 06 : 00 LT, {{stratification}} in the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>confined</b> {{the vertical}} mixing, thus allowing radon trapping, which eventually caused PG reduction by favoring negative space charge formation (Latha 2007), while CO 2 concentrations attained their maximum owing to respiration {{and lack of}} photosynthesis. After 6 : 00 LT, the initiation of morning mixing conditions diluted the space charges and photosynthesis began, thus increasing PG and reducing the CO 2 concentration. Between 12 : 00 and 16 : 00 LT, both curves followed a parallel downward trend as the vertical convection gradually maximized, further diluting the CO 2 and reducing the PG through an increase in columnar resistance and a subsequent decrease in the air–earth current. The latter mechanism referring to PG continued until 18 : 00 LT. During 16 : 00 – 21 : 00 LT, the CO 2 increased owing to the gradual transition to nocturnal stratification and the enforcement of CO 2 sources such as transpiration. The PG exhibits its secondary minimum at 18 : 00 LT and then increased parallel to the CO 2 trend, presenting the global thunderstorm activity.|$|R
40|$|The Space Station Freedom {{crew will}} face {{operational}} problems {{unique to the}} spacecraft environment due {{to the absence of}} convection currents and the <b>confined</b> <b>atmosphere</b> within the habitable modules. Airborne contaminants from the materials offgassing or contingency incidents like thermodegradation may accumulate until they reach hazardous concentrations. Flow modeling and experiences from previous space flight missions confirm that caution must be exercised during first-entry operations. A review of the first-entry procedures performed during the Skylab Program will be presented to highlight the necessity for carefully planned operations. Many of the environmental conditions that can be expected on the Space Station are analogous to those which exist in confined storage or work spaces in the industrial setting. Experience with closed-loop environmental operations (e. g., atmospheric control of submarines) have also demonstrated that the buildup of trace contaminant gases could result in conditions that lead to mission termination or loss of crew. Consequently, some first-entry issues for the Station can be addressed by comparing them to familiar techniques developed on Earth. The instruments of the Environmental Health System (EHS) will provide the necessary monitoring capability to protect crew health and safety during the planned first-entry procedures of the MTC phase of the SSF Program.

40|$|Aims. We {{construct}} a new analytical {{model of a}} solar coronal loop that is embedded in a gravitationally stratified and magnetically <b>confined</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> On {{the basis of this}} analytical model, we devise a numerical model of solar coronal loops. We adopt it to perform the numerical simulations of its vertical kink oscillations excited by an external driver. Methods. Our model of the solar atmosphere is constructed by adopting a realistic temperature distribution and specifying the curved magnetic field lines that constitute a coronal loop. This loop is described by 2 D, ideal magnetohydro- dynamic equations that are numerically solved by the FLASH code. Results. The vertical kink oscillations are excited by a periodic driver in the vertical component of velocity, acting {{at the top of the}} photosphere. For this forced driver with its amplitude 3 km/s, the excited oscillations exhibit about 1. 2 km/s amplitude in their velocity and the loop apex oscillates with its amplitude in displacement of about 100 km. Conclusions. The newly devised analytical model of the coronal loops is utilized for the numerical simulations of the vertical kink oscillations, which match well with the recent observations of decay-less kink oscillations excited in solar loops. The model will have further implications on the study of waves and plasma dynamics in coronal loops, revealing physics of energy and mass transport mechanisms in the localized solar atmosphere.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{synthesise}} nanopowders by laser pyrolysis in order to elaborate Si 3 N 4 -SiC nanocomposites exhibiting a high ductility at high temperature. The synthesis of SiCN and SiCNYAlO nanopowders with a good thermal stability has been developed from a liquid mixture based on hexamethyldisilazane with a gaseous precursor (silane, SiH 4) and ammonia. Si 3 N 4 -SiC nanocomposites exhibiting almost theoretical density have been elaborated by hot pressing under 35 MPa at 1600 °C either from SiCNYAlO nanopowders or from SiCN nanopowders mixed with commercial sintering aids nanopowders (6 wt% yttria and 3 wt% alumina) in ethanol and de-agglomerated by milling with Si 3 N 4 balls. The densification behaviour is better for nanopowders containing in-situ additives. In addition, using prealloyed powders enables to simplify the elaboration process since the mixing step of the nanopowders is eliminated. The nanocomposites elaborated from the mixture (SiCN + commercial sintering aids) exhibit a different microstructure, depending on the drying process (under vacuum or in an oven) of the nanopowders after the mixing step: When drying was performed in a <b>confined</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> a noticeable amount of Si 2 N 2 O was detected in addition to â-Si 3 N 4 and the average grain size was 60 nm, whereas the crystalline phases were á- and â-Si 3 N 4, when the slurry was dried under vacuum and the average grain size was 200 nm.

Results: The volunteers had distinct symptoms during the test with rarefied air: heat sensation (100 %), dizziness (47 %), headache (3 %), ocular pruritus (21 %), hand tremor (16 %), extrasystoles (16. 5 %), hypertonic blood pressure behavior (26 %), tachycardia (158. 5 ± 15. 9 bpm in rarefied air versus 148. 7 ± 15. 7 bpm in normal air; p< 0. 0002). All participants showed reduced oxygen saturation (93. 4 ± 3. 4 % in rarefied air versus 97. 7 ± 9. 92 % in normal air; p< 0. 00004). Discussion: Wide individual variability was found in symptoms and the parameters studied. In view {{of the results of}} this study, we recommend that a threshold of 45, 000 ppmv of CO 2 not be exceeded in speleological exploration. Likewise, fitness assessment should be performed in individuals planning to enter confined atmospheres, such as the caves and abysses of this mountain...|$|E
40|$|The {{outstanding}} electrical, {{mechanical and}} chemical properties of graphene make it attractive {{for a wide}} range of applications, particularly in the micro electronics field. Currently, chem- ical vapor deposition on copper foils is considered as the most promising route to synthesize graphene in terms of quality, thickness, uniformity and scalability. However, the realization of high-performance graphene-based devices requires the transfer from copper foils onto specific sub- strates. This transfer step is known to cause adverse effects on graphene quality and hinders drastically its processability. In contrast, graphene growth on copper thin films predeposited on passivated substrates enables the transfer-free deposition of graphene on insulating materials by using copper as a sacrificial layer. Moreover, this approach allows the processing of graphene by conventional thin film technologies. In this study, large-area graphene films are grown by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) using methane as carbon source directly onto evaporated copper thin films (700 nm) pre- deposited on SiO 2 /Si wafers. As graphene film quality and number of layers are the primary areas of concern for high-performance electronics, the CVD parameters including temperature, pressure and hydrogen-to-methane gas ratio have been optimized to obtain uniform films. Moreover, it is found that the presence of a cover located at a maximum of a few tens of microns from the copper surface is necessary to grow graphene. The interest of <b>confining</b> the <b>atmosphere</b> near the Cu surface stands on the significant reduction of copper evaporation which allows the formation of a stable graphene film on its top. The presence of graphene and the continuity of the film have been observed by the means of scanning electron microscopy while the quality of the film has been assessed by Raman spectroscopy. The results reveal that the confinement of the atmosphere in the vicinity of the copper surface is critical for the successful growth of graphene. The use of a fused quartz substrate directly in contact to the copper thin film demonstrated the best confinement results in terms of graphene uniformity and quality. In that way, a continuous predominantly single-layer graphene film has been achieved over surface areas up to 10 cm 2. The Raman measurements performed on the as- grown graphene indicate a I 2 D/IG ratio close to 2 and a ID/IG∼ 0 over nearly all the surface area reflecting that the film is predominately defect-free monolayer graphene...|$|R
40|$|Integrations of the {{hydrostatic}} {{system of}} equations for the divergent barotropic model of an <b>atmosphere</b> <b>confined</b> within latitudinal walls are performed with three finite-difference schemes of second-order accuracy. Scheme I is the so-called leap-frog scheme, commonly used in numerical forecasting, scheme I 1 is baaed on a method proposed by Lax & Wendroff and N. A. Phillips. Scheme I 11 waa discussed {{by one of the}} authors. Applying for all schemes the same grid system with respect to the field- and time-coordinates and allowing for no smoothing or friction it is possible to compare objec-tively the behaviour of the difference equations. Initially a geostrophically balanced jet stream field consisting of three zonal wave numbers is prescribed; the flow is baro-tropically unstable. The comparison is made with integrals of (a) eddy kinetic energy, including it's spectral parts, (b) zonal kinetic energy, (c) kinetic energy, and (d) total energy. The latter is a conservative property for the differential system. These integrals yield a good insight into the appearance of barotropic instability. This problem will be treated in a subsequent paper. All three methods give practically equal results within the first week of forecssting time; then scheme I begins to show numerical instability followed by scheme I 11 about one week later. Scheme I 1 seems to be completely stable, shows, however, aa expected, a slight tendency of damping relatively short waves. Scheme 111 requires one field less to be stored in the computer than schemes I and 11. 1. Einleitung Die sogenannten primitiven Gleichungen, d. h. die Eulerschen Bewegungsgleichungen in ihrer Grundform, sind in den letzten Jahren in immer stiirkerem Umfang fur numerische Wettervorhersagen und fur die Simulierung der allgemeinen Zirkulation der Atmosphiire her-angezogen worden.

40|$|We usually define as " {{nanoparticles}} ", those particles which {{present at}} least one dimension less than 100 nm. Several studies have measured different emission sources of nanoparticles, for indoor and outdoor air. It is also known that these particles {{are likely to have}} multiple effects on human health. (Oberdorster et al. (2005)). Aware of the risks related to nanoparticles, INERIS decided in 2009 to create a research program in order to develop a model that would be able to simulate the dynamics of nanoparticles in both <b>confined</b> and free <b>atmospheres.</b> Unlike existing models, it is necessary to follow both numerical and mass concentrations of particles in order to correctly account for the time evolution of nanoparticles and their potential health effects, as the number concentration is much more relevant for nanoparticles. This study addresses condensational growth, evaporation and coagulation. A comparative review of algorithms currently used in air quality models is presented as well as new algorithms adapted to nanoparticles. We use the sectional approach in which the size distribution is discretized into sections characterized by a fixed mean geometrical diameter, particles properties are assumed to be constant over each particle size section. Two different initial particle distributions are used, one from regional pollution in hazy conditions and another one from diesel engine emission measurements. During the simulation of condensational growth, evaporation and coagulation, the size of the particles changes. In order to maintain the fixed mean geometrical diameter of each section, we have to proceed to a redistribution of the particle mass and number concentrations at each time step: particles are then transferred to the section which corresponds to their new diameter. It appears that some of the algorithms used for redistribution are better fitted for nanoparticles, among them we present a new hybrid algorithm based on number redistribution for small sections and mass redistribution for coarse sections. Futur work will consist in including several physical processes specific to nanoparticles such as nucleation and wall deposition...|$|R
