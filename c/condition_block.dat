40|$|In {{order to}} {{know where we are}} when moving through space, we {{constantly}} update our mental egocentric representation of the environment, matching it to our motion. This process, termed "spatial updating", is mostly automatic, effortless, and obligatory (i. e., hard-to-suppress). Our goal here is twofold: 1) To quantify spatial updating; 2) To investigate the importance and interaction of visual and vestibular cues for spatial updating. The stimuli consisted of twelve targets (the numbers from 1 to 12, arranged in a clockface manner) attached to the walls of a 5 x 5 m room. Subjects saw either the real room or a photo-realistic 3 D model of it presented via a head-mounted display (HMD). For vestibular stimulation, subjects were seated on a Stewart motion platform. After each rotation, the subjects' task was to point "as quickly and accurately as possible" to four targets announced consecutively via headphones. Spatial updating performance was quantified in terms of response time and pointing error (absolute error and variance) in three different spatial updating conditions: Subjects were (a) rotated to a different orientation (UPDATE condition); (b) rotated as in (a), but asked to ignore that rotation and "point as if not having turned" (IGNORE); (c) rotated to a new orientation and immediately back to the original orientation before being asked to point (CONTROL); Each of the twelve subjects was presented with six stimulus conditions (blocks A-F, 15 min. each) in balanced order, with different amount of visual and vestibular information available. Performance, especially response times, varied considerably between subjects, but showed the same overall pattern: 1) Performance was best in the real world <b>condition</b> (<b>block</b> A). When the field of view was limited via cardboard blinders (block B) to match that of the HMD (40 x 30 °), performance decreased and was comparable to the HMD <b>condition</b> (<b>block</b> C). Presenting only visual information for the turns (through the HMD, block D) decreased the performance slightly further. 2) In those four blocks where there was visual information available about the rotation, subjects performed equally well in the UPDATE and CONTROL conditions. Performance in the IGNORE condition, however, was significantly impaired, indicating that spatial updating was indeed obligatory in the sense of being hard-to-suppress. 3) When subjects were blindfolded (block E) or saw a constant image of the scene (block F), IGNORE performance increased and was comparable to the UPDATE performance. This suggests that spatial updating was no longer obligatory when visual cues about the motion were removed. Speeded pointing tasks proved to be a viable method for quantifying "spatial updating". We conclude that, at least for the regular target arrangement and limited turning angles used (< 60 °), the Virtual Reality simulation of ego-rotation was as effective and convincing (i. e., hard to ignore) as its real world counterpart, even when only visual information was available...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays a very {{important}} aspect of telecommunication is quality of services. 3 G networks offer all of the customers’ best quality {{for each type of}} information including voice/video and data transmission. One of the vast discussion in this area is increasing the throughput and prevent the congestion in rush traffic hours in the network. Congestion occurs when transfer rate in the network is lower than requested rate by application. Congestion leads to cell loss and dropped cells should be retransferred to recover the data which is double job and affect the throughput and even can affect the quality of the services. Time sensitive information (voice/video) requires no data loss and they employ Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to recover the data. The number of the FEC codes should be kept small to prevent the overload in the network. In this paper I will show that just simple FEC is not enough when network interworks with Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). A powerful buffer management gives higher throughput and in that <b>condition</b> <b>block</b> loss rates reduces. In addition, effective utilization of IuB interfaces that link the Radio Network Controller (RNC) and Base Station (BS) has another effect on throughput.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{designed}} {{to examine the relationship}} between training and transfer tasks and performance on these tasks whereby training can be used to predict transfer. Previous research has assumed that performance of an established task should extrapolate the power function of learning. That is, performance of an established skill in a new domain will continue to improve at the same rate with practice as if there was no change in the domain. 60 participants were recruited from the University of Edith Cowan and were randomly assigned to one of three conditions; I 0 <b>block</b> <b>condition,</b> 20 <b>block</b> <b>condition,</b> or 30 <b>block</b> <b>condition.</b> Participants were required to complete a dot counting task.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between hippocampal function and aging was explored in Wistar rats using taste aversion learning {{by comparing the}} performance of adult dorsal hippocampal lesioned and fifteen-month-old intact rats with that of adult intact rats. In experiment 1 the <b>conditioned</b> <b>blocking</b> phenomenon was absent in the hippocampal and the aging rats. Unlike the adult intact rats, the hippocampal and aging rats were not impaired in acquiring a learned aversion to a cider vinegar solution (3 %) presented as a serial compound with a previously conditioned saccharin solution (0. 1 %). In experiment 2 both the hippocampal and the aging rats developed reduced aversions to a saline solution (0. 5 %) followed by an i. p. injection of lithium chloride (0. 15 M; 2 % b. w.) if the taste solution was previously preexposed without consequences. This latent inhibition effect {{was similar to that}} seen in intact adult rats. In both experiments, the aging rats exhibited enhanced conventional learned taste aversions.
