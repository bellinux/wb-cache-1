40|$|Percussion {{drilling}} {{technology was}} considered {{many years ago}} {{as one of the}} best approaches for hard rock drilling. Unfortunately the efficiency of most hydraulic hammer (HH) designs was very low (8 % maximum), so they were successfully used in shallow boreholes only. Thirty years of research and field drilling experience with HH application in Former Soviet Union (FSU) countries led to the development of a new generation of HH designs with a proven efficiency of 40 %. That advance achieved good operational results in hard rock at depths up to 2, 000 m and more. The most recent research has shown that there are opportunities to increase HH efficiency up to 70 %. This paper presents HH basic design principles and operational features. The advantages of HH technology for <b>coiled-tubing</b> drilling is shown on the basis of test results recently conducted in the US...|$|E
40|$|Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and its {{contractors}} {{have developed}} a conceptual design for a directional microborehole drilling system for hard-rock boring. Analytical calculations, simulations, {{and the results of}} laboratory testing of critical prototype drilling components have influenced the design. Two reduced-size drilling systems to produce small diameter, 500 -ft-long, directionally drilled river crossing trajectories are proposed to prove feasibility of the concept: (1) a 2 - 1 / 4 -in. diameter, early demonstration unit to drill directional ultraslimholes; and (2) a 1 - 1 / 8 -in. diameter, ultimate design to drill directional microboreholes. Both concepts use versatile, coiled-tubing-deployed, hydraulically-powered drilling assemblies, and a surface platform that includes a tubing injector unit to develop high load insertion (snubbing) of the tubing into the sealed borehole. Surface injection will be used to develop the required bit thrust, and both concepts provide for the use of a commercial, real-time, location and steering system that is readily and routinely adapted for deployment on a <b>coiled-tubing</b> drilling platform.

40|$|Novel flow-cells with {{integrated}} confluence {{points and}} reaction channels designed for efficient mixing of fast chemiluminescence systems were constructed by machining opposing {{sides of a}} polymer chip and sealing the channels with transparent epoxy-acetate films. A hole drilled through the chip provided the conduit from the confluence point on {{one side to the}} centre of the reaction zone on the other side, allowing rapid presentation of the reacting mixture to the photodetector. The effectiveness of each flow-cell was evaluated by comparing the chemiluminescence intensity using flow injection analysis methodology, and examining the distribution of light emanating from the reaction zone (captured by photography in a dark room) when the reactants were continuously merged. Although previously reported chemiluminescence detectors constructed by machining channels into polymers have almost exclusively been prepared using transparent materials, we obtained far greater emission intensities using an opaque white chip with a thin transparent seal, which minimised the loss of light through surfaces not exposed to the photomultiplier tube. Furthermore, this approach enabled the exploration of reactor designs that could not be incorporated in traditional <b>coiled-tubing</b> flow-cells. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Microhole {{technology}} development {{is based on}} the premise that with advances in electronics and sensors, large conventional-diameter wells are no longer necessary for obtaining subsurface information. Furthermore, microholes offer an environment for improved subsurface measurement. The combination of deep microholes having diameters of 1 - 3 / 8 in. at their terminal depth and 7 / 8 -in. diameter logging tools will comprise a very low cost alternative to currently available technology for deep subsurface characterization and monitoring. INDRODUCTION Los Alamos National Laboratory, in collaboration with the oil industry through the US Department of Energy Natural Gas and Oil Recovery Partnership, has undertaken an integrated program to show that the cost of obtaining subsurface information can be drastically reduced through microhole technologies expressly developed to obtain that information. Collectively termed “Microhole Drilling and Technology Development,” engineering efforts encompass: evaluating the feasibility of drilling deep microholes, miniaturization and testing of bottomhole <b>coiled-tubing</b> drilling assemblies, miniaturization of geophysical logging tools, and incorporation of emerging miniature sensor technologies in borehole seismic instrumentation packages...|$|E

This is being accomplished by developing an efficient and economically viable continuous microwave process to sinter continuously formed/extruded steel powder for the manufacture of seamless coiled tubing and other tubular products.

40|$|Utilities in the U. S. operate over 75, 000 km (47, 000 miles) of old {{cast-iron}} pipes for gas distribution. The bell-and-spigot joints tend to leak {{as these}} pipes age. Current repair practices are costly and highly disruptive. The {{objective of this}} program is to design, test and commercialize a robotic system capable of sealing multiple cast-iron bell and spigot joints from a single pipe entry point. The proposed system will perform repairs while the pipe remains in service by traveling through the pipe, cleaning each joint surface, and attaching a stainless-steel sleeve lined with an epoxy-impregnated felt across the joint. This approach will save considerable time and labor, avoid traffic disruption, and eliminate any requirement to interrupt service (which results in enormous expense to utilities). Technical challenges include: (1) repair sleeves must compensate for diametric variation and eccentricity of cast-iron pipes; (2) the assembly must travel long distances through pipes containing debris; (3) the pipe wall must be effectively cleaned in the immediate area of the joint to assure good bonding of the sleeve; and (4) an innovative bolt-on entry fitting is required to conduct repair operations on live mains. The development effort is divided into eleven tasks. Task 1 [...] Program Management was previously completed. Two reports, one describing the program management plan and the other consisting of the technology assessment, were submitted to the DOE COR in the first quarter. Task 2 [...] Establishment of Detailed Design Specifications and Task 3 [...] Design and Fabricate Ratcheting Stainless-Steel Repair Sleeves are now well underway. First-quarter activities included conducting detailed analyses to determine the capabilities of <b>coiled-tubing</b> locomotion for entering and repairing gas mains and the first design iteration of the joint-sealing sleeve. The maximum horizontal reach of coiled tubing inside a pipeline before buckling prevents further access was calculated {{for a wide range}} of <b>coiled-tubing</b> string designs and pipe environments. Work conducted in the second quarter consisted of: (1) selecting a preferred pan/zoom/tilt camera; (2) initiating design of the digital control electronics and switching power supply for the control and operation of the in-pipe robotic modules; (3) continuing design of the repair sleeve and (4) initial testing of the wall-cleaning device. Most recently, activities in the third quarter included: (1) development of the system's pan/zoom/tilt camera control electronics and operating software, and implementing these in the surface and downhole modules and (2) further testing of the wall-cleaning elements used to clean the inside of the bell and spigot joints.

40|$|Effective Gravel-packing of {{horizontal}} wells {{is difficult to}} achieve, using conventional pre-slotted liners, yet it is generally required in the soft Heavy Oil reservoir rocks of California, where cyclic steam injection has been proven {{to be the most}} cost-effective oil recovery method. The proposed method of gravel placement behind a non-perforated liner, which is later perforated {open_quotes}in situ{close_quotes} with a new tool operated by <b>coiled-tubing,</b> is expected to greatly reduce costs resulting from sand production in horizontal wells operated under cyclic steam injection. The detailed configuration of the prototype tool is described. It includes two pairs of cutting wheels at the ends of spring-loaded pivoting arms, which are periodically pressed through the liner wall and shortly thereafter retracted, while the coiled tubing is being pulled-out. For each operating cycle of the hydraulically-operated tool, this results in a set of four narrow slots parallel to the liner axis, in two perpendicular diametral planes. The shape of the edges of each slot facilitates bridging by the gravel particles, for a more effective and compacted gravel-packing. The tool includes a few easily-assembled parts machined from surface-hardened alloy steel presenting great toughness, selected from those used in die making. The operation of the system and potential future improvements are outlined. The method of fabrication, detailed drawings and specifications are given. They will serve as a basis for negotiating subcontracts with qualified machine shops...|$|E
40|$|Distributed {{fiber optic}} sensing {{presents}} unique features that have no match in conventional sensing techniques. The ability to measure temperatures and strain at thousands of points along a single fiber is particularly interesting for the monitoring of elongated structures such as pipelines, flow lines, oil wells and coiled tubing. Sensing systems based on Brillouin and Raman scattering are used for example to detect pipeline leakages, verify pipeline operational parameters, prevent failure of pipelines installed in landslide areas, optimize oil production from wells and detect hot-spots in high-power cables. Recent developments in distributed fiber sensing technology allow the monitoring of 60 km of pipeline from a single instrument and of up to 300 km {{with the use of}} optical amplifiers. New application opportunities have demonstrated that the design and production of sensing cables is a critical element for the success of any distributed sensing instrumentation project. Although some telecommunication cables can be effectively used for sensing ordinary temperatures, monitoring high and low temperatures or distributed strain present unique challenges that require specific cable designs. This contribution presents advances in long-range distributed sensing and in novel sensing cable designs for distributed temperature and strain sensing. The paper also reports a number of significant field application examples of this technology, including leakage detection on brine and gas pipelines, strain monitoring on gas pipelines and combined strain and temperature monitoring on composite flow lines and composite <b>coiled-tubing</b> pipes...|$|E

40|$|The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) {{has been}} signed by many countries, {{including}} the US. The US Senate will start discussions of CTBT ratification {{in the near}} future. The Treaty aims to prevent any nuclear explosion from being conducted. A verification system is being implemented. It includes the possibility of On-Site Inspections (OSI) {{in a country where}} a suspicious seismic signal has been identified, which could come from a clandestine nuclear test. As part of an OSI, the use of drilling is allowed by the CTBT so as to obtain irrefutable proof of a Treaty violation. Such proof could be in the form of diagnostics of very high gamma radiation levels and high temperatures underground, which could not be explained by a natural source. A typical situation is shown in Figure 1, where the OSI team must find a nuclear cavity underground when only an approximate location is inferred. This calls for the ability to do directional drilling. Because {{there is no need for}} large borings and to minimize the cost and size of the equipment, slim-hole drilling is adequate. On that basis, an initial study by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [1] concluded that <b>coiled-tubing</b> (C-T) was the most attractive option for OSI drilling (Figure 2). Then, a preliminary design of a C-T Rapid Deployment Drilling System (RDDS) was performed by Maurer Engineering of Houston, TX [2]. Although a drilling mud system is also included in the RDDS definition, the preferred mode of operation of the RDDS would be drilling with air and foam. This minimizes water requirements in cases when water may be scarce at the OSI site. It makes the required equipment smaller than when a mud system is included. And it may increase the drilling rates, by eliminating the ''chip hold-down'' effect of a mud column. Following this preliminary design study, it was determined that the preferred bottom-hole assembly for such a system would be the Viper system of Schlumberger Anadrill, with one essential modification from the version used in the oil-and-gas industry: the ability to record very high gamma levels. Under contract with LLNL, Anadrill modified the Viper gamma tool, a NaI-based probe, and verified that it provided reliable gamma data up to 64, 000 cps, as opposed to the less than 200 cps encountered in normal applications [3]...|$|E
40|$|The {{verification}} {{regime of}} the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) {{provides for the}} possibility of on-site inspections (OSI`s) to resolve questions concerning suspicious events which may have been clandestine nuclear tests. The initial phase of an OSI may provide enough evidence to justify a request to the CTBT Organization for allowing drilling, so as to recover further evidence of a nuclear event. The equipment that was used for such `re-entry` drilling in the days of U. S. underground nuclear testing is considered too heavy and cumbersome for OSI deployments. So, an effort was initiated in 1995 to define, assemble, and demonstrate a new OSI drilling capability. <b>Coiled-tubing</b> (C-T) was selected as the most attractive technology because of its portability and its directional drilling capability (1). Following this selection, a preliminary engineering design was performed in 1996 for a Rapid Deployment Drilling System (RDDS). This system must have capabilities for downhole diagnostics of temperature and gamma-rays, since both types of data could be used to confirm the presence of an underground nuclear explosion. The study then identified two candidate downhole diagnostic systems operating with CT: the VIPER system of Schlumberger-Anadrill, and the Transocean system (2). In the current phase of this continuing effort the VIPER system has been retained as the first candidate because, everything else being equal, it is readily accessible domestically. One project, conducted by Maurer Engineering of Houston, TX, is specifying the details of the proposed CT system, its footprint, its modalities of air transport, and its costs of deployment and operation. The expected rate-of-penetration in rocks with unconfined compressive strength up to 14, 500 psi (100 MPa) is also being estimated, based on laboratory-scale drilling tests on rock cores. Another project, which is the object of this report, has for an objective to develop and calibrate a downhole gamma-ray diagnostic capable of operating in the expected high-intensity environment near an underground nuclear cavity. The commercially available Anadrill VIPER logging assembly is calibrated to operate at levels of 0 to 250 American Petroleum Institute (API) units. These levels are much smaller than those necessary to confirm a clandestine nuclear explosion. The scope of the project is to make the necessary modifications to the VIPER gamma-ray module to meet minimum detection requirements of 50, 000 API. At such a level, which is more than two orders of magnitude higher than seen in natural formations, the origin of gamma-rays could only be from underground nuclear test products. 2 refs, 2 figs, 2 tab...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research program has been to improve the rate-of-penetration in deep hostile environments by improving the life cycle and performance of <b>coiled-tubing,</b> {{an important component of}} a deep well drilling system for oil and gas exploration. The current process of the manufacture long tubular steel products consists of shaping the tube from flat strip, welding the seam and sections into lengths that can be miles long, and coiling onto reels. However, the welds, that are a weak point, now limit the performance of the coil tubing. This is not only from a toughness standpoint but also from a corrosion standpoint. By utilizing the latest developments in the sintering of materials with microwave energy and powder metal extrusion technology for the manufacture of seamless coiled tubing and other tubular products, these problems can be eliminated. The project is therefore to develop a continuous microwave process to sinter continuously steel tubulars and butt-join them using microwave/induction process. The program started about three years ago and now we {{are in the middle of}} Phase II. In Phase I (which ended in February 2005) a feasibility study of the extrusion process of steel powder and continuously sinter the extruded tubing was conducted. The research program has been based on the development of microwave technology to process tubular specimens of powder metals, especially steels. The existing microwave systems at the Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) and Dennis Tool Company (DTC) were suitably modified to process tubular small specimens. The precursor powder metals were either extruded or cold isostatically pressed (CIP) to form tubular specimens. After conducting an extensive and systematic investigation of extrusion process for producing long tubes, it was determined that there were several difficulties in adopting extrusion process and it cannot be economically used for producing thousands of feet long green tubing. Therefore, in the Phase II the approach was modified to the microwave sintering combined with Cold Isostatic Press (CIP) and joining (by induction or microwave). This process can be developed into a semi-continuous sintering process if the CIP can produce parts fast enough to match the microwave sintering rates. This report summarizes the progress made to-date in this new approach. The final steel composition matching with the Quality tubing's QT- 16 Cr 80 was short listed and used for all experiments. Bonding experiments using 4 different braze powders were conducted and the process optimized to obtain high degree of bonding strength. For fabrication of green tubulars a large CIP unit was acquired and tested. This equipment is located at the Dennis Tool facility in Houston. Microwave sintering experiments for continuous processing of the CIPed tubes are under progress in order to identify the optimum conditions. There have been some reproducibility problems and we are at present working to resolve these problems...|$|E
40|$|Underbalanced {{drilling}} {{is experiencing}} growth {{at a rate}} that rivals that of horizontal drilling in the mid- 1980 s and <b>coiled-tubing</b> drilling in the 1990 s. Problems remain, however, for applying underbalanced drilling in a wider range of geological settings and drilling environments. This report addresses developments under this DOE project to develop products aimed at overcoming these problems. During Phase I of the DOE project, market analyses showed that up to 12, 000 wells per year (i. e., 30 % of all wells) will be drilled underbalanced in the U. S. A. within the next ten years. A user-friendly foam fluid hydraulics model (FOAM) was developed for a PC Windows environment during Phase I. FOAM predicts circulating pressures and flow characteristics of foam fluids used in underbalanced drilling operations. FOAM is based on the best available mathematical models, and was validated through comparison to existing models, laboratory test data and field data. This model does not handle two-phase flow or air and mist drilling where the foam quality is above 0. 97. This FOAM model was greatly expanded during Phase II including adding an improved foam rheological model and a ''matching'' feature that allows the model to be field calibrated. During Phase I, a lightweight drilling fluid was developed that uses hollow glass spheres (HGS) to reduce the density of the mud to less than that of water. HGS fluids have several advantages over aerated fluids, including they are incompressible, they reduce corrosion and vibration problems, they allow the use of mud-pulse MWD tools, and they eliminate high compressor and nitrogen costs. Phase II tests showed that HGS significantly reduce formation damage with water-based drilling and completion fluids and thereby potentially can increase oil and gas production in wells drilled with water-based fluids. Extensive rheological testing was conducted with HGS drilling and completion fluids during Phase II. These tests showed that the HGS fluids act similarly to conventional fluids and that they have potential application in many areas, including underbalanced drilling, completions, and riserless drilling. Early field tests under this project are encouraging. These led to limited tests by industry (which are also described). Further field tests and cost analyses are needed to demonstrate the viability of HGS fluids in different applications. Once their effectiveness is demonstrated, they should find widespread application and should significantly reduce drilling costs and increase oil and gas production rates. A number of important oilfield applications for HGS outside of Underbalanced Drilling were identified. One of these [...] Dual Gradient Drilling (DGD) for deepwater exploration and development [...] is very promising. Investigative work on DGD under the project is reported, along with definition of a large joint-industry project resulting from the work. Other innovative products/applications are highlighted in the report including the use of HGS as a cement additive...|$|E
