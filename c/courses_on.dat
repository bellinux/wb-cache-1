5|$|In 1816 Balzac {{entered the}} Sorbonne, {{where he studied}} under three famous professors: François Guizot, who later became Prime Minister, was Professor of Modern History; Abel-François Villemain, a recent arrival from the Collège Charlemagne, lectured on French and {{classical}} literature; and, most influential of all, Victor Cousin's <b>courses</b> <b>on</b> philosophy encouraged his students to think independently.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop <b>courses</b> <b>on</b> non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has <b>courses</b> <b>on</b> both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E

5|$|<b>Courses</b> <b>on</b> {{this subject}} have grown {{significantly}} {{in the last couple}} of decades. Teaching accountants about ethics can involve role playing, lectures, case studies, guest lectures, as well as other mediums.

5|$|The RAAF {{moved to}} rectify the {{situation}} by re-forming No.2OTU on 1March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and deHavilland Vampire jets. Cresswell took command of No.2 OTU on 21May 1953. The unit ceased flying Mustangs that October, retaining its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it began conducting fighter combat instructor courses, as well as refresher <b>courses</b> <b>on</b> jets. Cresswell delivered the first Australian-built CAC Sabre jet fighter to No.2 OTU in November, and the same month established the unit's Sabre Trials Flight. The flight was responsible for performance testing and developing combat flying techniques, {{in concert with the}} Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU). On 3December 1954, Creswell led a formation of twelve No.2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.77 Squadron upon its arrival from service in Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance. Training <b>courses</b> <b>on</b> the Sabre began on 1January 1955. Once the Sabre entered operational service in March 1956, the Sabre Trials Flight was dissolved and its responsibilities passed to No.3 Squadron. Pilots underwent their introduction to jets and fighter combat at No.2 OTU, but finished their conversion to Sabres at a front-line squadron.|$|E

5|$|Bogosian {{was born}} to Ike and Vicky Bogosian in Massena, New York, a town of 13,000 {{adjacent}} to the Saint Lawrence River. He is the first NHL player of Armenian descent; his great-grandfather, Stephen Bogosian, left Western Armenia in 1923 {{at the age of}} 16 {{as a result of the}} Armenian Genocide. At the age of 2½, Bogosian first began to skate. He joined the Massena Minor Hockey Association when he was 3, staying in the program until he was 14, when he left for Cushing Academy. Bogosian first began to play defense at the Squirt level (under-10); though he was smaller than most of his peers, he was a good skater. He alternated between forward and defense throughout minor hockey. When he began attending Cushing Academy he was a forward the first year, before he converted to a defender full-time. After leaving the school and moving to Canada with two years of high school to complete, Bogosian took <b>courses</b> <b>on</b> the internet.|$|E
5|$|Escoffier also {{simplified}} {{and organized}} the modern menu {{and structure of}} the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his Livre des menus in 1912. This type of service embraced the service à la russe (serving meals in separate <b>courses</b> <b>on</b> individual plates), which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The book was a collaboration with Philéas Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s, {{improvements}} in technology {{led to a}} greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, {{and a reduction in}} their size and price. Alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on communication devices. Speech output possibilities included digitized and synthesized speech, with text-to-speech options available in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish and Ewe. AAC services became more holistic, seeking to develop a balance of aided and unaided strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the person's daily life, and greater involvement of the family. Increasingly, individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, head injury, and locked-in syndrome, received AAC services. In addition, with the challenge to the notion of AAC prerequisites, those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served. <b>Courses</b> <b>on</b> AAC were developed for professional training programs, and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students, clinicians and parents.|$|E

He was discharged from the Army in 1946, but continued to work at Los Alamos as a civilian for another year in order to earn some money. He would briefly return to Los Alamos in 1948.|$|E
