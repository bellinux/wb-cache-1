40|$|In this study, we use various {{diagnostic}} {{techniques to}} investigate the synoptic evolution of the Pacific–North American teleconnection pattern (PNA). National Center for Environment Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis data are used. These data cover the years 1948 – 2008 for the months of November–March. It is found that the positive PNA is initiated by enhanced convection over the western tropical Pacific and weakened convection over the tropical Indian Ocean. The excitation of the negative PNA exhibits opposite features. For both phases, the response to tropical convection excites a small-amplitude PNA about 8 – 12 days prior to the pattern attaining its maximum amplitude. This is followed by slow, steady growth for about 5 days, after which driving by synoptic scale waves, via their eddy vorticity flux, together with stationary eddy advection lead to much more rapid growth {{and the establishment of}} the full PNA. For the positive PNA, the synoptic scale waves propagate eastward into the midlatitude northeastern Pacific, where they are observed to undergo <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> breaking. For the negative PNA, the synoptic scale waves first amplify over the midlatitude northeastern Pacific and then propagate equatorward into the Subtropics where they undergo anticyclonic wave breaking. Once established, for both phases, the PNA appears to be maintained through a positive feedback that involves a succession of wave breakings. These results suggest that preconditioning may {{play an important role in}} the formation of the PNA. For the positive PNA, in its early development, the strengthening and eastward extension of the subtropical jet result in an increase in the cyclonic shear and a decrease in the meridional potential vorticity gradient, features that are known to favour <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> breaking. For the negative PNA, opposite changes were observed for the background flow, which favour equatorward wave propagation and anticyclonic wave breaking. The role of optimal growth is also discussed. Our results also suggest that the PNA is potentially predictable 1 – 2 weeks in advance. Copyright © 2011 Royal Meteorological Societ...|$|E

The modeling shows that the impacts of SLR vary spatially and are strongly influenced by the bathymetry of the reef and coral type. A complex response occurs for the wave orbital velocity and forces on corals, such that {{the changes in the}} wave dynamics vary reef by reef. Different wave loading regimes on massive and branching corals also leads to contrasting impacts from SLR. For many reef bathymetries, wave orbital velocities increase with SLR and <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> forces are reduced for certain coral species. These changes may be beneficial to coral health and colony resilience and imply that predicting SLR impacts on coral reefs requires careful consideration of the reef bathymetry and the mix of coral species...|$|E

Massive corals are determined not to be vulnerable to wave induced structural damage, whereas branching corals are susceptible at wave induced orbital velocities exceeding 0. 5 m/s.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{outlines}} a {{new approach}} devoted {{to the analysis of}} extreme waves in presence of several wave regimes. It consists in discriminating the different wave regimes from offshore wave data using classification algorithms, before conducting the extreme wave analysis for each regime separately. The concept is applied on the pilot site of Reunion Island which is affected by three main wave regimes: Southern waves, trade-wind <b>waves</b> and <b>cyclonic</b> <b>waves.</b> Several extreme wave scenarios are determined for each regime, based on real historical cases (for <b>cyclonic</b> <b>waves)</b> and extreme value analysis (for non-cyclonic waves). For each scenario, the nearshore wave characteristics are modelled all around Reunion Island and the linear theory equations are used to back calculate the equivalent deep-water wave characteristics for each portion of the coast. The relative exposure of the coastline to the extreme waves of each regime is determined by comparing the equivalent deep-water wave characteristics. This method provides a practical framework to perform an analysis of extremes within a complex environment presenting several sources of extreme waves. First, at a particular coastal location, it allows for inter-comparison between various kinds of extreme waves that are generated by different processes and that may occur at different periods of the year. Then, it enables to analyse the alongshore variability in wave exposition, which is a good indicator of potential runup extreme values. For the case of Reunion Island, <b>cyclonic</b> <b>waves</b> are dominant offshore around the island, with equivalent deep-water wave heights up to 18 m for the northern part. Nevertheless, due to nearshore wave refraction, southern waves may become as energetic as <b>cyclonic</b> <b>waves</b> on {{the western part of the}} island, and induce similar impacts in terms of runup and submersion. This method can be easily transposed to other case studies and can be adapted depending on the data availability...|$|R

Erosional impacts were reported on 17 out of 26 topographic transects, while nine transects exhibited accretion. Sediment loss and gain reached maximum average values of 1. 23 and 0. 36 m 3 /m of transect, respectively. Sediment deposition occurred on upper beaches and foredunes, which gained up to 1 m in thickness. After 1 year, beach resilience proved to be medium (from 0. 4 to 0. 8 m 3 /m) to high ([0. 8 m 3 /m) on 40 % of transects, but some transects exhibited permanent dune loss. Marine inundation reached a maximum distance of 70. 8 m from the vegetation line and a maximum elevation of 6. 9 m above sea level. The indigenous vegetation showed high resistance to the impacts of the cyclone and rapid regeneration, whereas introduced species were lastingly damaged. The <b>cyclonic</b> <b>waves</b> damaged 18 seawalls protecting either public infrastructures or private properties, half of which had been reconstructed 3 months later. Severe damage was also caused to a marinabuilt in the downstream section of a river. Importantly, this study emphasises the vicious cycle effects caused by ‘‘coastal compression’’ that exacerbates the devastating impacts of <b>cyclonic</b> <b>waves</b> on beaches, vegetation and protection structures, encouraging coastal residents to strengthen engineered structures.

40|$|Abstract. A Rossby wave {{breaking}} {{identification method}} is presented which searches for overturning of absolute vorticity contours on pressure sur-faces. The results are {{compared to those}} from an analysis of isentropic po-tential vorticity, and it is demonstrated that both yield similar wave break-ing distributions. As absolute vorticity is easily obtained from most model output, we present wave breaking frequency distributions from the ERA-Interim data set, thirteen general circulation models (GCMs) and a barotropic model. We demonstrate that a poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere midlat-itude jet {{is accompanied by a}} decrease in poleward wave breaking in both the barotropic model and all GCMs across three climate forcing scenarios. In addition, it is shown that while anticyclonic wave breaking shifts poleward with the jet, <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> breaking shifts less than half as much and reaches a poleward limit near 60 degrees S. Comparison of the observed distribution of Southern Hemisphere wave breaking with those from the GCMs suggests that wave breaking on the poleward flank of the jet has already reached its poleward limit and will likely become less frequent if the jet migrates any further poleward with climate change...|$|E
40|$|Given {{the recent}} {{observational}} {{evidence that the}} positive (negative) phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is the remnant of anticyclonic (<b>cyclonic)</b> <b>wave</b> breaking, this study uses a multilevel primitive equation model to investigate important dynamical attributes of the above wave breaking behavior. For this purpose, a hierarchy of different basic states (two- and three-dimensional) and initial perturbations are used. With the three-dimensional climatological flow as the basic state, {{it is found that}} initial perturbations located equatorward (poleward) and upstream of the climatological Atlantic jet lead to wave breaking {{similar to that of the}} positive (negative) NAO phase. Consistently, analysis of observational data indeed shows that the Pacific storm track is displaced equatorward (poleward) prior the onset of the positive (negative) NAO phase. This result suggests that the latitudinal position of the Pacific storm track plays an important role for determining the phase of the NAO. Sensitivity experiments show that individual life cycles resemble each other only within the NAO region, but have large case-to-case variability outside of the NAO region. Calculations with zonally symmetric basic states fail to produce wave breaking of the correct spatial and temporal scale, underscoring the dynamical significance of the three-dimensional climatological flow. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{baroclinic}} stability properties of non-geostrophic atmospheric flow in a channel are investigated. The model is formulated {{so as to}} include the effects of latitudinal variations of the perturbations and the basic state parameters, which constitute an essential aspect of the non-geostrophic {{baroclinic stability}} problem.

In order to allow for high horizontal resolution the present calculations are restricted to a particular two-layer model which appears to incorporate the major non-geostrophic aspects of the baroclinic instability problem. A purely non-geostrophic type of baroclinic instability is found which bears some resemblance to barotropic instability in spite of the absence of latitudinal shear in the zonal flow. This instability is introduced by the twisting term in the vorticity equation and the non-geostrophic advection of temperature in the thermodynamic equation.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of internal waves in a two-layer rotating circular lake was studied under nonlinear and weak nonhydrostatic effects. Inclusion of nonlinear acceleration allowed the waves to steepen {{at the rear}} of the crest in deep lakes, forming a front with time. The nonhydrostatic acceleration is shown to counteract this wave steeping, leading to wave dispersion, and when the two effects are in balance, solitary-type waves can form. It is shown that a Kelvin wave evolves by imparting energy primarily to submodes of the parent <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> by steepening and to solitary-type waves. By contrast, a Poincare wave is shown to evolve without shedding much of its energy to other waves, and only a small fraction of the wave energy goes to other submodes, and this is not lost from the parent wave but rather is periodically transferred back into the parent wave. When both Kelvin and Poincare waves were present simultaneously in the waterbody, then an interaction was observed when both waves were in phase, which gave rise to additional wave components.

The methodology consists of analyzing NCEP–NCAR reanalysis data and sensitivity runs from a high-resolution nonhydrostatic regional model.

A series of adiabatic and frictionless nonlinear baroclinic wave life cycles in a midlatitude tropospheric jet with different initial zonal flow {{conditions in the}} stratosphere is simulated, using a dry primitive equation model with spherical geometry. When a stratospheric jet, located at various latitudes between 35 degrees and 70 degrees, {{is removed from the}} initial conditions, the wavenumber- 6 life cycle behavior changes from the well-known LC 1 to LC 2 evolution, characterized by anticyclonic and <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> breaking, respectively. Linear theory, in terms of refractive index and the structure of the corresponding fastest-growing normal mode, is found to be unable to explain this stratosphere-induced LC 1 to LC 2 transition. This implies that altered nonlinear wave-mean flow interactions are important. The most significant stratosphere-induced change that extends into the nonlinear baroclinic growth stage is a region of downward wave propagation in the lower stratosphere associated with positive values of the squared refractive index near 20 km. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the difference between the response of the tropospheric circulation to LC 1 and LC 2 life cycles closely resembles the meridional and vertical structure of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with positive (negative) NAO-like anomalies being driven by LC 1 (LC 2).

The absolute vorticity effect favors the anticyclonic (southwest–northeast) tilt and anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) and is stronger in the upper troposphere. In contrast, the stretching effect promotes the cyclonic (northwest–southeast) tilt and <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> breaking (CWB) and is more efficient at lower levels. A positive eddy feedback acting on the latitudinal variations of the zonal winds is deduced. Because the absolute vorticity and the stretching effects are respectively more and less efficient with increasing latitude, a more northward (southward) jet renders AWB more (less) probable and CWB less (more) probable; the jet is pushed or maintained more northward (southward) by the eddy feedback. Idealized numerical experiments using two aquaplanet models on the sphere, a three-level QG model, and a 10 -level primitive equation (PE) model, confirm our analysis.

From this analysis a close link between wave breaking, the NAO, and the stratosphere is found: 1) a positive feedback between the occurrence of AB (CB) events and the positive (negative) phase of the NAO is suggested, whereas wave breaking in general without any reference to AB- or CB-like behavior does not affect the NAO, though it preferably emerges from its positive phase. 2) AB strengthens the North Atlantic eddy-driven jet and acts to separate it from the subtropical jet, while CB weakens the eddy-driven jet and tends to merge both jets. 3) AB (CB) events are associated with a stronger (weaker) lower-stratospheric polar vortex, characterized by the 50 -hPa northern annular mode. During persistent weak vortex episodes, significantly more frequent CB than AB events are observed concurrently with a significant negative NAO response up to 55 days after the onset of the stratospheric perturbation.

40|$|Extract] The Australian {{coastline}} {{is shaped}} by processes operating {{over a wide range}} of time-scales, ranging from post-glacial sea level rise to daily tides. In northern Australia <b>cyclonic</b> <b>waves</b> and winds must be added, as well as the effects of major floods. Geomorphic process records are largely absent over most of the area, while maps and aerial photography rarely predate the 1960 s. Thus there may be value in considering the written records of early explorers in combination with historic imagery to evaluate long-term coastal change. Such an opportunity was provided through the Flinders Bicentenary expedition organised by the Royal Geographical Society of Queensland. The specific area was the Pennefather River of western Cape York, some 40 km north of Weipa. The Pennefather River (Figure 1, page 202) has a well developed spit at its mouth, backed by extensive mud banks and mangrove swamps. This is a consequence of dominant longshore drift and periodic flood outflows from the river. This spit may well have changed its extent and location in historic times since Flinders visited the area in 1802. To the north and south of the estuary are a set of three well developed transgressive dunes which may correlate with the early to mid-Holocene sequence recorded near Weipa by Lees et al. (1999). These transgressive dunes were probably formed by the reworking of late Pleistocene sand masses following recovery of sea level after the Last Glacial. This mechanism, termed the Cooper-Thom event, relies on the role of large storms in the Gulf of Carpentaria destroying coastal vegetation and thus remobilising stabilised dunes. Do such storms cause similar effects today? Have major cyclones in the historic period reshaped this landscape? What other disturbance processes are at work...|$|R

This study examines the potential of anticyclonic (AB) and <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> breaking (CB) to drive NAO-like meridional circulation dipoles by investigating the synoptic evolution of AB and CB events in a mid-latitude eddy-driven jet in a simplified GCM with zonally uniform basic state. First, a method {{for the detection of}} such events from daily isentropic maps of potential vorticity and horizontal deformation is constructed. Then, from the obtained sample of events AB- and CB-composites of the upper and lower tropospheric flow are computed, and a distinct spatial and temporal asymmetry in the response to AB and CB events is found. While from the interaction of two AB events (with a mean lifetime of 2. 6 days) a strong and short-lived positive phase NAO-like dipole is produced at the surface but not at upper levels, single CB events (4. 3 days) are found to drive a strong and more persistent negative phase NAO-like dipole at upper levels but not at the surface. It is concluded that AB (CB) is not capable of driving a positive (negative) phase NAO-like dipole individually. However, the results suggest that equivalent barotropic NAO-like variability may arise from the successive occurrence of AB and CB events. Further, a sensitivity to the strength of the stratospheric polar vortex is found with more (less) frequent AB (CB) events under strong vortex conditions.

The model is based on an existing dry model that was shown to be able to reproduce the midlatitude synoptic and low-frequency variability of the troposphere. In addition to potential vorticity equations, moisture evolution equations are included with a simple precipitation scheme. The model can be forced using reanalysis datasets to represent the observed climatology. After the description of the model, the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude climatic characteristics of the moist model are compared to its dry counterpart and to the 40 -yr ECMWFRe-Analysis (ERA- 40). The jet of the moist model is weakened in its central and northern part and enhanced in its southern part compared to the dry version, which generally decreases the model biases compared to reanalyses. Latent heating processes are mainly responsible for the global decrease in westerlies in the jet-core regions. Precipitation mainly occurs slightly poleward of the jet axes, thereby reducing the meridional temperature gradient and the wind through thermal wind balance. The mean synoptic activity is reduced according to the decrease in baroclinicity, as well as the mean low-frequency variability. A diagnosis of synoptic wave breaking is performed and the characteristics of the moist model are closer to the ones found in reanalyses, especially with more occurrence of <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> breaking. Weather regimes are slightly better represented in the moist model, although changes are weak compared to the intrinsic model biases. The behavior of the moist model around its climatology indicates that it could be used to run sensitivity experiments...|$|E
40|$|In Sri Lanka, nearshore {{wave climate}} is {{influenced}} by the simultaneous occurrence of swell waves approaching from a more or less southerly direction and sea waves mainly influenced by monsoonal weather pattern. Some nearshore areas are also vulnerable for occasional impact of <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> conditions. This complexity and high degree of temporal and spatial variability of waves clearly emphasize the need for accurate assessment of near shore wave climate. The lack of wave recordings at nearshore location restricts the assessment of nearshore wave climate to some extent. This deficiency in wave data can be overcome by transforming waves from location at which wave data are available through wave propagation modelling. This research study is aimed to develop two dimensional mathematical model based on an irregular wave description capable of simulating wave propagation from offshore to nearshore considering wave transformations due to shoaling, refraction, wave breaking and bottom friction dissipation. The wave conservation equation and the model of Battjes and Janssen were used as the basis to develop the model. Galle (70 m depth) is considered as offshore location which represents the entire deep water wave climate off the southern offshore coast. Hambantota (17 m depth) and Kudawella(I 5 m depth) were selected as nearshore locations to establish the directional wavestatistics for swell and sea waves by applying the developed mathematical model. Finally based on obtained nearshore wave data base, predictions for extreme wave conditions were made as design wave parameters for coastal and harbour structures. Extremewave heights analysis were done for both offshore and nearshore locations in southerncoast of Sri Lanka using two statistical extreme value probability distributions, namely Gumbel (Fischer-Tippet Type 1) distribution and the Weibull distributio...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this {{experimental}} investigation, {{the dynamics}} of symmetry-breaking instabilities in swirling jets is analyzed for swirl parameters S in the pre-breakdown range O=S=Sc, where Sc= 1. 3 is the critical swirl value for the appearance of vortex breakdown determined by Billant, Chomaz, and Huerre [J. Fluid Mech. 376, 183 (1998) ]. As S is increased, three distinct dynamical regimes {{have been identified in}} the streamwise region extending {{to the end of the}} potential core. In the low swirl range S < 0. 6, the evolution is governed by the same instability mechanisms as in a nonswirling jet. The shear in axial direction generates axisymmetric vortex rings at a Strouhal number independent of the swirl S. As S increases, the amplitude of the axisymmetric mode decreases in magnitude. Concurrently, co-rotating streamwise vortices form in the braids connecting the rings due to a secondary instability mechanism. The advection by the mean rotation of these secondary structures generates an azimuthal wave propagating cyclonically when compared to the imposed rotation, at a phase velocity proportional to swirl. When swirl reaches the transitional swirl level S ~ 0. 6, no azimuthal or standing wave is observed, and the swirling jet is completely dominated by the development of the axisymmetric mode into ring vortices. In the intermediate swirl range 0. 6 < S = 1, vortex rings form concurrently with several interacting helical <b>cyclonic</b> <b>waves</b> of azimuthal wave number 2. The mean phase velocity of the resulting propagating wave increases at a constant rate with swirl, and much more rapidly than in the low swirl regime. In this swirl range, azimuthal and axisymmetric deformations are of comparable high levels. In the high swirl range 1 < S < 1. 3, another step toward complexity is reached, and there is a strong interaction between the azimuthal waves and the ringlike structures. The most striking feature of this flow regime is the emergence of a bending mode m= 1 propagating with a high negative phase velocity. © 2003 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

40|$|Objective {{analysis}} {{of several hundred}} thousand anticyclonic and <b>cyclonic</b> breaking Rossby <b>waves</b> is performed for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) winters of 1958 - 2006. A winter climatology of both anti-cyclonic and <b>cyclonic</b> Rossby <b>wave</b> breaking (RWB) frequency and size (zonal extent) is presented for the 350 -K isentropic surface over the NH, and the spatial distribution of RWB is shown to agree with theoretical ideas of RWB in shear flow. Composites of {{the two types of}} RWB reveal their characteristic sea level pressure anomalies, upper- and lower-tropospheric velocity fields, and forcing of the upper-tropospheric zonal flow. It is shown how these signatures project onto the centers of action and force the velocity patterns associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM). Previous studies have presented evidence that anticyclonic (cyclonic) breaking leads to the positive (negative) polarity of the NAO, and this relationship is confirmed for RWB over the midlatitudes centered near 50 °N. However, an opposite and statistically significant relationship, in which cyclonic RWB forces the positive NAO and anticyclonic RWB forces the negative NAO, is shown over regions 20 ° to the north and south, centered at 70 ° and 30 °N, respectively. On a winter mean basis, the frequency of RWB over objectively defined regions covering 12 % of the area of the NH accounts for 95 % of the NAO index and 92 % of the NAM index. A 6 -hourly {{analysis of}} all the winters indicates that RWB over the objectively defined regions affects the NAO/ NAM without a time lag.

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} reevaluate <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> {{scenarios}} used for hazard studies for two French Polynesian Islands (Tahiti and Moorea) {{with a combination}} of expertise and probabilistic analysis. The method entails (1) constituting a set of cyclones based on both historical data and synthetic events obtained by translating real historical tracks (2) computing the coastal wave characteristics all around the islands for each cyclone with numerical models (3) performing a statistical analysis on the model outputs and determining orders of magnitude of 10 and 100 yr wave characteristics (significant wave height: SWH, and peak period: T p) for the different sectors of the islands. The results show that if the western and southwestern coasts are more exposed to frequent cyclonic events (with 10 yr SWH up to 5 m and associated T p up to 16 s), the northern coasts are the most vulnerable if a cyclone pass very close to the islands because they face the main direction of propagation of waves. For these coasts, the 100 yr SWH can reach 12 m with T p around 12 s. On the contrary, southern coasts are the least exposed to extreme wave heights with 100 yr SWH below 7 m and associated T p around 10 s. However, southern coasts can also be affected by very long southern waves all year long (100 yr SWH around 5 m and T p up to 15 s) that can have similar effects than cyclonic waves at the coast. Although these results are associated with high uncertainties related to the restricted sample of cyclones used, they provide realistic and rational orders of magnitude of cyclonic significant wave heights and associated periods for different return periods, taking into account the alongshore variability in wave exposure around the islands...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to compare the potential direct economic losses between two different hazards in Guadeloupe, earthquakes and storm surges, for different return periods. Probabilistic seismic hazard has been calculated fort return periods of 100, 1000 and 5000 years and 475 years map exists previously. The lithological and topographic amplifications are taken into account. In Guadeloupe, building stock was characterized in terms of main structural type during the SDRS Guadeloupe project (Bertil et al. 2008). This work has been complemented incorporating the total cost {{for each type of}} building, considering the construction cost. Vulnerability of current building, scholar and commercial buildings has been assessed using the vulnerability index method (RISK-UE method). The estimation of economic losses is done linking the physical damage state for each construction and damage ratios (repair cost/total repair cost). This result has been compared with the loss estimation coming from CCR data (Reinsurance Organism in France) after the Saintes earthquake (2004) (Figure 1). The storm surge hazard assessment process includes (1) the determination of 100 -year <b>cyclonic</b> <b>wave</b> height and surge level and (2) the calculation of coastal inundation hazard maps for a 100 -year return period scenario. The modeling of waves and surge induced by 300 cyclones over the 20 th century in the area of Guadeloupe Island has been performed (Figure 2). The statistical analysis of wave heights is done and the statistical analysis of surge levels is still in progress. Due to the limited number of events available in the historical databases, the uncertainties of the results remain quite high. The assessment of inundation hazard maps will be performed with a simple method by crossing the water level with the topographic data to determine the areas lying below this level. For storm surge risk assessment the building typology is the same one considered for seismic risk, just adapting vulnerability functions. State of art of available vulnerability functions in storm surge and floods in tropical context has been done (CAPRA software, HAZUS software) even if these functions do not consider explicitly the local context in Guadeloupe. Damages caused by wind are not considered. Looking at past events damages in Martinique and Guadeloupe (Hugo 1989, Luis 1995, Lenny 1999, Dean 2007, Omar 2008) it has been seen the damage distribution pattern (very destructive zone, damaging zone and inundation zone). In general strong structural damages are caused by beach erosion and cannot be associated directly to water height. The past events data are not enough to build vulnerability functions. Potential direct economic losses will be estimated, crossing inundation maps with built areas and vulnerability function for each kind of construction...|$|E
40|$|Data from a {{thermistor}} {{chain and}} wind sensor collected over an annual stratification cycle in Lake Kinneret (Israel) during 2000 {{were used to}} investigate the seasonal evolution of wind/internal wave resonance. Internal wave periods determined from an analytical model were compared with observations, and we show that resonance during 2000 occurred during three distinct times of the year—at the onset of stratification (March), during the heating phase (June), and during the cooling phase (November). In all cases, resonance was between {{the wind and the}} dominant radial, azimuthal, and vertical mode-one <b>cyclonic</b> (Kelvin) <b>wave</b> previously observed in Lake Kinneret. Internal waves are a ubiquitous feature of lakes, existing because of wind forcing acting on a stratified water column, where the stratification is generally due to temperature. Wind applied to the surface can cause a surface setup of water at the downwind end. This pressure force is balanced by a tilting of the metalimnion in the opposite sense—that is, downward at the downwind end (Spigel and Imberger 1980). When the wind forcing relaxes, the water surface oscillate...|$|R

Though designed to {{examine the impact of}} stratospheric aircraft, the study more generally addresses the transport between tropics and middle latitudes for a three month period from January through March 1989. The results show that air is transported from the tropics to middle latitudes by planetary scale and tropospheric <b>cyclonic</b> scale <b>waves.</b> Except for intrusions by these wave events, the tropics are substantially isolated throughout the lower stratosphere. These waves draw material out of the tropics which ends up in the middle latitude westerly jets, with little material entering the winter polar latitudes prior to the springtime transition. The summer Southern Hemisphere is characterized by tracer being drawn out in streamers that extend from north and west to south and east. The material in the tropics is zonally asymmetric. The material that reaches the troposphere comes down in the synoptic scale eddies and is concentrated in the middle latitude jet stream. These characteristics are similar to those observed during the dispersion of volcanic clouds...|$|R
