50|$|This type of winding {{structure}} {{creates an}} optimal fill factor (90.7%) for round wires. In {{order to do}} so, the windings of the upper layer need to be placed into the grooves, provided by the lower layer. If the circles are superposed, it can be seen, that the most compact design {{can be achieved by}} using an arrangement with a 60 degree angle. The ratio of provided space to the part of the circle can be determined mathematically.The best spatial use can be achieved if the winding is parallel to the coil flange for most of its circumference, in order to fulfill the stated requirement. When the winding has been placed around the coil body it will meet with the previous positioned wire and needs to make a step with the size of the wire gauge. This movement is called winding step. The winding step can occupy an area of up to 60 degree of the coil circumference for round coil bobbins and takes one side of rectangular coil bobbins. The area of the winding step is dependent on the wire gauge and coil bobbin geometry. If the winding step cannot be executed properly then the self-guiding ability of the wire is lost and a wild winding is produced. Overall, the first intruding wire mainly determines the location and quality of the winding step. It should be recognized that the wire needs to enter in a possibly flat angle into the winding space. That way an unnecessary bending of the wire is being avoided and the needs space for the second winding step is minimized. For orthocyclic wound coils, the winding step areas is always located at the area of wire entering the winding space and is being continued in helical form against the winding direction. As a consequence a bigger winding width of the <b>coil,</b> <b>leads</b> to a bigger winding step area along the circumference of the coil. The created offset leads to a different position of the layer step, from the first to the second layer, in comparison to the wire entry. This behavior repeats itself with every layer which leads to a spiral shaped crossover section {{at the side of the}} winding.Due to the fact that wires are crossing within the crossover section the resulting winding height is increased. As a result, orthocyclic wound coils with a round coil ground are never circular in the cross over section, but the radial moving winding and layer step creates a hump shape. Experience has shown that, depending on the winding width, coil and wire diameter, the crossover section is about 5 to 10 percent higher than the regular winding height.|$|E

These analyses relate to a few issues still requiring some resolution. Finite element analyses by the ITER International Team (IT) and other US PT analyses are cited for comparison with the finite element results. The degree of preload required to offset vertical tensions in the coils are discussed. Parametric analyses of different preloads and friction coefficients have been performed which point to a lower preload than that specified by the project. Lateral loading on the CS due to postulated off center electromagnetic loads are quantified. Lateral seismic loads are applied, and the existing and proposed restraint systems are discussed. Behavior of the upper flex supports is also available from the simulation model and will be compared with previous work. The <b>coil</b> <b>leads</b> are supported by the preload system tie-plates. Radial differential motion between the tie-plates and coils is quantified for the case {{where there is no}} radial coupling between the coils and tie-plates. Support provisions for the leads are discussed in the context of both load capacity and displacement absorbing ability. vertical loads on the CS. Torsional registration between the modules is provided by interlocking the modules with radial grooves and keys. The compliance of the coil stack and the differential loads along the height of the stack cause small but significant rotations at the flex plates, which are designed primarily for purely radial displacements.

Methods and results On 13 pacemaker leads (Setrox JS 53, Biotronik) traction force testing was performed under different configurations. The leads {{were assigned to}} three groups: (i) traction force testing without central locking stylet support (n = 5), (ii) traction force testing {{with the use of}} a locking stylet (Liberator, Cook Medical) and a proximal ligation suture (n = 4), (iii) traction force testing {{with the use of a}} locking stylet and a compression coil (n = 4). The following parameters were obtained for all groups: stress-strain curves, maximal forces, elastic modulus, post-testing lead length and lead elongation. In Groups 2 and 3 retraction of the locking stylet within the lead was measured [lead tip-locking stylet distance (LTLSD) ]. Maximal forces for the three groups were: (i) 28. 3 ± 0. 3 N; (ii) 30. 6 ± 3. 0 N; (iii) 31. 6 ± 2. 9 N (1 vs. 2, P = 0. 13; 1 vs. 3, P = 0. 04; 2 vs. 3, P = 0. 65). Elastic modulus was (i) 22. 8 ± 0. 1 MPa; (ii) 2830. 8 ± 351. 1 MPa; (iii) 2447. 0 ± 510. 5 MPa (1 vs. 2, P < 0. 01; 1 vs. 3, P < 0. 01; 2 vs. 3, P = 0. 26). Mean LTLSD in Group 2 was 19. 8 ± 3. 2 cm and was 13. 8 ± 1. 7 cm in Group 3 (P = 0. 02). The ratio of LTLSD/post-testing lead length was 0. 37 ± 0. 03 for Group 2 and 0. 24 ± 0. 03 for Group 3 (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Monitoring the coil-stretch {{transition}} of polymers in transient extensional flow fields provides a unique possibility {{to observe the}} stress distribution between polymer and solvent even for very dilute solutions (with sub-ppm concentrations). It is generally accepted that for concentrations below the critical concentration (c/c* < O(1)) the steric and frictional interactions of neighboring polymer coils are negligible and the rheological response of the fluid is solely governed by the solvent and the weak hydrodynamical interactions of the isolated polymer coil and the solvent. However, this definition of diluteness is only applicable close to the equilibrium state of polymer coils. Especially in extensionally-dominated flow fields, the coil-stretch {{transition of}} a polymer <b>coil</b> <b>leads</b> to an increased interaction volume of the polymer and therefore to polymer-polymer interactions even for concentrations of c/c* < O(1). The term “ultradilute” solution has been introduced recently to describe systems that remain truly dilute even when the polymer chains are in a highly stretched and deformed non-equilibrium state. The Capillary Break-up Extensional Rheometer provides a convenient means for probing chain-chain interactions {{as a function of}} polymer concentration through measurements of the characteristic time-scale of the fluid in a strong extensional flow However, in order to analyze the dynamics of the capillary break-up process it is necessary to answer the question of how much stress is carried by the polymer and how much by the solvent? In other words, under what physical conditions does a coil-stretch transition on the molecular scale occur and affect the resulting macroscopic fluid dynamics so {{that it is possible to}} detect a really “ultradilute” solution? In this paper we will present recent investigations on the capillary break-up behavior of a series of polystyrene solutions with narrowly-distributed molecular weight that are progressively diluted in solvents with different viscosities (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Radius vs. time in a capillary break-up extensional rheometer experiment for solutions of polystyrene (Mw= 1. 9  106 g/mol, Mw/Mn= 1. 03) in styrene oligomers at different concentrations. (end plate diameter 6 mm, initial separation distance 3 mm final distance 10 mm separation time 50 ms). We show that there exists a critical dilution concentration below which the dominant stress resisting breakup is carried solely by the solvent. This observation is supported by numerical simulation of the stress evolution using a multimode FENE-P mode algorithm based on the one-dimensional analysis of Entov and Hinch for transient extensional flows (Fig. 2). Figure 2. Force balance for a collapsing liquid bridge of a dilute polystyrene solution (Mw= 1. 9  106 g/mol, c= 250 ppm, stresses in Pa).

40|$|Existing shock sensors for car {{protection}} {{using the}} sensitive elements (SE) of piezoelectric, microphone and electromagnetic types and the analogue circuitry of signal processing, {{have a number}} of essential shortcomings: - piezoelectric sensitive elements have no characteristics repeatability that complicates their use in mass production; - microphone sensors are structurally complicated and demand difficult information signal processing; - sensitive elements of electromagnetic sensors demand individual control (a specified clearance to be set between a magnet and the coil). Use of analogue elements (resistors, capacitors) in the amplifier and filter circuits reduces temporary and temperature stability of characteristics. An adjustment of the sensor operating zones via variable resistors on a printed circuit is extremely inconvenient and doesn't allow to change quickly the sensor sensitivity depending on an external situation (for example, to increase quickly an operating zone of the sensor with an alarm system of a key fob when securing a car in the country or in the woods, or to reduce it in the street with heavy traffic streams). An analogue circuit–based sensor design disables its automatic adaptation to such external impacts as a rain, a stream passing by cars, etc. The article considers how to solve some of above problems while designing the two-zone digital shock sensors with a SE of electromagnetic type. It shows the SE design developed by the authors as a module containing the coil and a magnet, secured on the coil axis in a silicone extension. The circuitry solution and algorithms of signals processing allowed authors to realize a remote control of the prevention and alarm zones (with 16 gradation of sensitivity). The algorithm of self-adaptation to the repeating external impacts is proposed. The developed method to form the basic levels of digital comparators for each gradation of sensitivity enables the sensor to have the straight-line adjusting characteristic. The developed shock sensor is implemented as stock-produced items included in the car alarm systems of the trademark “Excellent” (made by JSC Magic Ring Ltd.). Operating experience (about 40 thousand pieces realized now) allows a proper adjustment of sensors to be possible on cars with any body type. A sufficient level of the sensor sensitivity proves it. The reliability of sensors is confirmed by failures statistics in use (0, 08 %). Failures are, usually, caused by the SE coil wire break in a soldering point of the <b>coil</b> <b>leads</b> to the printed circuit. However a number of shortcomings are also revealed. Experimental data processing of a test batch of sensors has shown that existing SE of electromagnetic type have the frequency of free vibrations f  80  5 Hz and a decay constant of transient under shock   0, 2 s. At these parameters a SE pass-band makes only f  1, 5 Hz, and the sensor responses only to the shock front, rather than to the secondary vibrations of a body. It is an essential drawback of the narrow-band sensors. The experiments conducted on test batch of sensors (10 samples) have shown essentially different sensitivities of sensors under shock {{in the direction of the}} sensitivity axis and perpendicular to it. This difference reaches 4 - 6 gradations of sensitivity. It means that when mounting a sensor on the particular car the orientation of sensitivity axis of the sensor will be of crucial importance that is also a shortcoming. It is shown that overcoming the specified drawbacks is hardly because of the improvement of sensitive elements suspension of electromagnetic sensors. Three-axial accelerometers implemented using MEMS technologies seem to be the most perspective application here. </p...|$|E

Background: ICDs are first-line therapy for adults re-suscitated from sudden cardiac death (SCD) or {{at high risk for}} life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Use of ICDs in children and young adults is infrequent and there are few data regarding this group. Methods: We abstracted and analyzed data for all patients in whom ICDs were implanted.

Di-agnoses included long QT syndrome (9), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [6], repaired congenital heart disease [5], and idiopathic ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation [4]. Indications comprised resuscitated SCD [15], syn-cope [9], and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia [3]. Initial device placement was infraclavicular in 13, abdominal in 13 and intrathoracic in 1.

The Hunt and Hess grading scale was used to describe their neurological condition at admission. To describe the outcomes, we used the Glasgow Outcome Scale. One-stage treatment of all aneurysms by means of single craniotomy or <b>coiling</b> doesn't <b>lead</b> to the deterioration of a patient's condition. The outcomes were determined by a patient's neurological condition at admission rather than the number of aneurysms, which were clipped or coiled. With acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, when there occur multiple aneurysms, a sequential multimodal approach may prove more beneficial...|$|R
40|$|The main {{goals of}} the DIII-D {{experiments}} in 1997 were, by extending and integrating the understanding of fusion science, to make progress in the tokamak concept improvements as delineated in the DIII-D Long Range Plan and to make substantial contributions to urgently needed R and D for the ITER Engineering Design Activity. For these purposes, the authors modified the top divertor to include pumping with baffling of high triangularity shaped plasmas and brought into operation two megawatt-level-gyrotrons for electron cyclotron heating (ECH) and off-axis current drive. The elements of the DIII-D experimental program and its objectives are organized into five topical areas: Stability and Disruption Physics, Transport and Turbulence Physics, Divertor and Boundary Physics, Wave-Particle Physics, and Integrated Fusion Science and Innovative Concept Improvement. The resulting DIII-D fusion science accomplishments are described in detail in this report. This year was characterized {{by a number of}} important activities, most notably, two 110 GHz ECH gyrotrons were installed and commissioned, the upper RDP cryopump and baffle was installed, and the ohmic heating <b>coil</b> <b>lead</b> was successfully reinforced to allow return to the design coil configuration and an increase to 7. 5 V-s next year. Real-time ``Isoflux`` plasma control was implemented to control the shape and position of the plasma. This system solves the MHD equilibrium equation in real time to accurately determine the location of the plasma boundary. At the same time, the authors were able to improve their safety record with three minor accidents and no lost time accidents. The staff available for operations tasks was substantially reduced owing to recent budget reductions and this impacted a number of activities...|$|R
40|$|Many Riata (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) implantable cardioverter {{defibrillator}} (ICD) leads have reportedly developed cable externalization. The {{most likely}} cause of cable externalization is insulation abrasion, which often occurs at the can or between the right ventricular coil and superior vena cava (SVC) coil. We report a rare case of an adult male whose ICD lead cable was externalized at the proximal portion of the SVC <b>coil.</b> This <b>lead</b> became fixed to the wall at the subclavian vein and SVC and became bent between these adhesions. Furthermore, the motion of this lead was affected by pulsation of the aortic arch. The ICD lead might develop inside-out abrasion due to mechanical stress evoked by pulsation of the aortic arch at this site.. © 2016 Japanese College of Cardiology. Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Riata and Riata ST {{family of}} implantable cardioverter-defibrillator leads {{are prone to}} a unique type of {{structural}} failure involving exteriorization of the conductor cables, which may present as electrical failure. We report a mode of lead failure that occurred in a patient with a Riata 1570 series dual <b>coil</b> 8 F <b>lead.</b> In this case, the first appropriate shock for ventricular fibrillation resulted in noise, that in turn led to recurrent inappropriate shocks and proarrhythmia, that clinically mimicked a life-threatening electrical storm...|$|R
40|$|A helix {{constructed}} of plutonium {{was made to}} test the Doppler temperature effect in ZPR-III. The helix. 1 in. in diameter and 6 1 / 4 in. long. contained 240 g of deltaphase plutonium alloy encapsulated in titanium tubing. rour piutonium rods were extruded, joined together, and pushed into a titanium tube. This tube was swaged tightly over the piutonium rod. and the assembly was wound into a <b>coil.</b> Electrical <b>leads</b> to the <b>coil</b> were made by swaging copper tubing over {{the ends of the}} coil. The helix was tested by cycling about 500 times between 50 and 190 deg C. The coil was heated with a current of 130 amperes and cooled with a blast of chilled helium. Several helices of uranium were cycled during the same tests. Despite the severity of the thermal cycles. the helices were undamaged. (auth...|$|R

The Medtronic sutureless screw electrode {{is applied to the}} diaphragmatic surface of the heart through a transxiphoid approach. The unit is inserted in the abdominal wall between the transversalis fascia and the transversus muscle. The method is simple, taking approximately 30 minutes to complete. It avoids thoracotomy.
