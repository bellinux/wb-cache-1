25|$|The first {{reported}} attack occurred in March 1995 in Puerto Rico. Eight sheep were discovered dead, each with three puncture wounds {{in the chest}} area and completely drained of blood. A few months later, in August, an eyewitness, Madelyne Tolentino, reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of Canóvanas, when as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed. In 1975, similar killings {{in the small town}} of Moca were attributed to El Vampiro de Moca ("The Vampire of Moca"). Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a Satanic cult; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals was reported to have had its body bled dry through a series of small <b>circular</b> <b>incisions.</b>|$|R
40|$|Compression fossils {{from the}} Silurian and Devonian of {{southern}} Britain, composed of cuticles and tubes, were described by W. H. Lang as the genus Nematothallus and placed, with Prototaxites, in Nematophytales, related neither to algae nor tracheophytes. Dispersed cuticles of Nematothallus and perforated forms assigned to Cosmochlaina were frequently recovered in macerates, their affinities being unresolved. New collections from a Lochkovian locality in the Welsh Borderland permitted {{the reconstruction of}} the stratified thalli of these nematophytes; they comprise a superficial cortex (which produced the cuticles) overlying a palisade zone composed of septate, parallel tubes, presumed to be hyphae, and a basal zone comprising wefts of randomly interwoven hyphae. Excellent three dimensional preservation allows the erection of a new species of Nematothallus, N. [*]williamii. A similar anatomy is seen in a new group of fossils with either <b>circular</b> <b>incisions</b> in the cortex or complete separation of thickened cortical cells, presumably comprising a developmental sequence. By their stratified organization the nematophytes differ from extant and extinct algae and bryophytes and the enigmatic Spongiophyton. A complex anatomy and septate tubes suggest affinity with lichenized fungi. Limited data support a fungal rather than embryophyte chemistry, but a photobiont is missing. Nematophytes, globally widespread in cryptogamic covers from mid-Ordovician times, added to the biodiversity in early terrestrial ecosystems and enhanced chemical weathering...|$|R

40|$|Midfacial {{degloving}} is {{a proven}} method for easily accessing the midface, the nasal pyramid, the maxillary and ethmoidal sinuses, the orbits, {{as well as}} the anterior skull base. Indications for this method of access mainly include tumour resections {{in the area of the}} midface, the septum, the maxillary sinus, the paranasal to the sphenoidal sinus {{as well as the}} clivus. In addition, this method of access allows for the exposure of the bony structures of the midface in the event of extensive fractures. In general, this method of access combines an incision in the oral vestibule and <b>circular</b> <b>incisions</b> in the nasal vestibule area in order to release the nasal pyramid. After removing the facial wall of the maxillary sinus, extensive exposure of the surgical site is possible. One disadvantage of this method of access is the difficult reconstruction of the nasal valve area, which often leads to cicatricial stenoses and difficulties with breathing through the nose. Furthermore, wound healing problems and osteoradionecrosis in the area of the lateral margin of the anterior nasal aperture after replantation of the facial wall of the maxillary sinus have been described, because in this area sufficient soft tissue coverage cannot be ensured when a conventional technique is used. We describe a soft tissue flap pedicled in the cranial and caudal directions in the nasal valve area which makes both the reconstruction of the nasal vestibule and sufficient soft tissue coverage of the anterior nasal aperture possible...|$|R

40|$|The »round block« {{surgical}} technique {{in the treatment}} of a female patient with multiple, multicentric fibroadenomas in both breasts is presented. The advantages of this technique for patients with multicentric benign breast lesions are minimal postoperative scar and a favourable aesthetic result. Breast dimensions and the areolar diameter were measured in 203 subjects of Primorsko-goranska county during examination in the Out-Patient Hospital for Breast Diseases, including the operated patient. Smaller breast dimensions and a larger areolar diameter provide an easier access to any part of the breast due to a smaller distance between the incision and a fibroadenoma and a larger circumference of <b>circular</b> periareolar <b>incision,</b> thus facilitating the surgery. The analysis of average, maximum and minimum values measured shows that the »round block« technique can be performed in all cases of multiple and multicentric fibroadenomas regardless of breast size, areolar diameter and the location of fibroadenoma in the breast...|$|R

Our goal was to evaluate the best diagnostic methods and the late complications following surgical treatment of penile fracture. Material and Methods: We studied retrospectively 11 patients with penile fracture {{in a period of}} 10 years (1985 - 1995). Results: In 55 % of the cases, the injury occurred during sexual intercourse. All patients presented with a very suggestive clinical picture (pain, detumescence and hematoma) and only 2 were submitted to further investigation (ultrasonography) to confirm the diagnosis. Only one patient had urethral bleeding and therefore was submitted to retrograde urethrogram, which confirmed urethral injury. All patients were treated by immediate surgery, through a <b>circular</b> subcoronal <b>incision</b> and degloving of the penis to allow a thorough exploration. All patients had a tunica albuginea tear that was promptly repaired, and 2 patients (18 %) had associated urethral injury (one had no symptoms) that was also repaired. All patients did very well after surgery and only one had a mild curvature, which did not hinder intercourse during follow-up (18 months).

Five <b>circular</b> infective <b>incisions</b> were generated {{on the back of}} each rabbit. Wound dressings were performed every day since postoperative day 1. Ten rabbits were euthanized on days 3, 7, 14, and 21. Each specimen was divided into two parts, one was used for detecting interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β), and the other one was used for detecting basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Result. The content of IL- 1 β in the model group was higher than those in the other groups (P< 0. 05). The content of IL- 1 β in the treatment group was lower than the other groups on days 14 and 21. The expression of bFGF in treatment group is significant on days 3, 7, and 14, compared with traditional Chinese medicine group and model group. The expression of bFGF has no significant difference with Western group. Conclusion.

30|$|This {{procedure}} is called intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE). Patients experienced many surgical complications after this surgical operation. Because of these complications, surgeons reapplied extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). This technique {{was based on}} creating an opening, known as a “capsulotomy”, in the anterior capsular bag through which the lens nucleus could be “prolapsed” (Mohammadpour et al. 2012). During this operation, using a small cross-section of about 1.5  mm, {{the inside of the}} eye is reached and a small piece is extracted in order to remove the cataractous lens from the anterior capsule. Then, via ultrasonic waves, the functionless lens is destroyed and removed via vacuum. Finally, an artificial lens is placed in the same region. The most important step is to make a <b>circular</b> <b>incision</b> in the anterior capsule to remove the cataractous lens. This step is called capsulorhexis. The importance of consistently achieving a symmetrically round and properly sized capsulorhexis has increased because the surgeon’s main target is to fit newer refractive IOLs. In order to maximize the performance of the capsulorhexis step, several approaches have been developed (Gimbel and Neuhann 1990, 1991; Pande 1993; Gimbel 2007).|$|E

40|$|Introduction Penile {{fracture}} is a urological emergency {{caused by}} direct trauma to an erected penis, tearing the tunica albuginea in the corpus cavernosum. The preferred treatment method is draining the hematoma and surgical repair of tunica albuginea tear {{as soon as}} possible following diagnosis. Materials and Methods Forty-nine patients who were diagnosed with penile fracture between January 2009 and December 2014 were reviewed. Physical examination was performed to see the extent of penile hematoma, the side of the penile curvature and the presence of blood in the external meatus. Two patients who were diagnosed with urethrorrhagia underwent retrograde urethrogram for urethral injury. In all patients, penile skin was peeled using a <b>circular</b> subcoronal degloving <b>incision</b> and tunica tear was repaired using absorbable suture materials. The patients were then followed for painful erections, penile deformities and erection angles. Results The average age of the 49 patients, who were included in the study, was 36. 5 years (21 - 65). In their etiological questioning, most patients reported the fracture occurring during sexual intercourse. Retrograde urethrography was indicated in 2 patients with blood in the external meatus and were diagnosed with urethral injury. The patients were taken to emergency surgery. Tunica defects varied between 1 and 2 cm. Incomplete urethral injuries were primarily repaired around 18 French Foley catheter. None of the patients reported penile deformity or painful erections. Their erection angles were found to be within the normal range. Conclusion Even though it is a relatively rare condition, penile fractures are so important that might cause serious complications when not treated surgically. A thorough anamnesis and physical examination suffice for diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Congenital urethroperineal fistula is an {{extremely}} rare anomaly in which a second channel rises from the prostatic urethra and opens onto the perineum. This entity resembles the hypospadiac type of urethral duplication, but resection of the ventral channel is simple and curative. Case: A 4 -year-old healthy boy had a small pimple on his perineum that yielded {{a small amount of}} whity discharge. Discharge occurred every one month for three years. The patient had no history of incontinence or urinary tract infection. Physical examination revealed a small opening to the median perineal raphe below the scrotum. Voiding cystourethrogram showed a normal urethra but no fistula was demonstrated. Fistulography failed due to closure of external orifice at the small pimple. MRI revealed abnormal sagittal tract from the pimple to the prostatic urethra. A <b>circular</b> <b>incision</b> was made around the pimple and the dissection was performed along the fistula. The fistula was ligated. Histopathologic examination of the fistula revealed that it was lined with squamous epithelium. Two months after surgery, incision of the abscess was performed. He has been well with 8 months postoperatively. Conclusion: Simple resection of the ventral channel of the urethroperineal fistula is curative. While both are rare entities, differentiation to the hypospadiac type of urethral duplication is crucial for definite treatment...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{objective}} of this work is to describe a conservative surgical technique {{as an alternative to}} classic penile amputations, aiming the local control of the disease, in addition to trying to preserve the patient's sexual function. SURGICAL TECHNIQUE: After a <b>circular</b> <b>incision</b> of the skin around the penis, the subfascial plane is developed until the base of the organ. The dorsal neurovascular bundle and the urethra are isolated in their distal extremities. The neurovascular bundle is sectioned distally. A retrocoronal dissection plane is developed between the glans and the corpora cavernosa. When this stage is complete, the glans is fixed only to the urethra, which is distally sectioned as well. The neurovascular bundle is fixed to the dorsal albuginea. Following the spatulation of the urethra, a neomeatus is created using the overlay skin of the penis. Between January 2001 and July 2002, we employed this technique in 6 patients who had epidermoid carcinoma of the penis, which were limited to the glans, superficial, well or moderately differentiated and measuring up to 3 cm. COMMENTS: Several conservative surgical methods for treatment of carcinoma of the penis aim the organ's preservation, in an attempt of improving {{the quality of life of}} patients, however the indexes of local recurrence and failure in disease control are significant. The described technique showed to be safe and effective for disease control, in addition to preserving sexual function in all patients who were treated, representing, thus, a quite appealing conservative surgical alternative in selected cases...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Penoscrotal {{transposition}} may be partial or complete, {{resulting in}} variable degrees of positional exchanges between the penis and the scrotum. Repairs of penoscrotal transposition {{rely on the}} creation of rotational flaps to mobilise the scrotum downwards or transpose the penis to a neo hole created in the skin of the mons-pubis. All known techniques result in complete <b>circular</b> <b>incision</b> around the root of the penis, resulting in severe and massive oedema of the penile skin, which delays correction of the associated hypospadias and increases the incidence of complications, as the skin vascularity and lymphatics are impaired by the designed incision. A new design to prevent this post-operative oedema, allowing early correction of the associated hypospadias and lowering the incidence of possible complications, had been used, whose results were compared with other methods of correction. Materials and Methods: Ten patients with incomplete penoscrotal transposition had been corrected by designing rotational flaps that push the scrotum back while the penile skin remains attached by small strip to the skin of the mons-pubis. Results : All patients showed an excellent cosmetic outcome. There was minimal post-operative oedema and no vascular compromise to the penile or scrotal skin. Correction of associated hypospadias can be performed in the same sitting or in another sitting, without or with minimal complications. Conclusion: This modification, which maintains the penile skin connected to the skin of the lower abdomen by a small strip of skin during correction of penoscrotal transposition, prevents post-operative oedema and improves healing with excellent cosmetic appearance, allows one-stage repair with minimal complications and reduce post-operative complications such as urinary fistula and flap necrosis...|$|E
40|$|Background: Rumenostomy may be {{performed}} for therapeutic and digestibility research purposes in bovines, small ruminants and camelids. Several studies requires romenostomy in buffaloes {{in order to}} sample ruminal content for laboratorial assays. However, complications and outcome of rumenostomy was poorly studied in buffaloes. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} current study was to describe a two-stage rumenostomy technique in buffaloes, focused on intra and post-operative period. Materials, Methods & Results: Nine Murrah buffaloes were submitted to a 36 -h and 12 -h of food and water fastening. The animals were given acepromazine and maintained in standing position. Flank local anesthesia was carried out. A <b>circular</b> skin <b>incision</b> was carried out {{in the center of the}} left flank, followed by divulsion of the external and internal obliques and transversus abdominus muscles, and incision of the peritoneum. Subsequently, a segment of the dorsal aspect of the rumen was grasped and pulled through the flank incision. The rumen was attached to the peritoneum and skin incision margins in four points (dorsal, ventral, cranial and caudal). Additional simple interrupted sutures attaching the rumen serosa to the skin were applied subsequently. Four additional interrupted horizontal mattress sutures were applied equidistantly, taking bites only in the skin and rumen serosa. Following 12 h, the second stage was carried out. The buffaloes were prepared and restrained as performed for the first stage. A circular flap was excised from the exteriorized rumen and the silicone romenostomy cannula was placed. Clinical parameters, postoperative recovery, weight and behavioral pain scale were assessed. Positioning and anesthesia regimen were adequate for the achievement of the procedure. However, two animals fell in the restraint chute during the first surgical stage. Mild ischemia of the exteriorized rumen segment was observed on the second surgical stage, which resulted in less hemorrhage and enhanced cannula positioning. Complete cicatrization and permanent adhesion of the rumen to the skin were achieved. No ruminal leakage to the abdominal cavity occurred. No signs of pain were reported. There were few cases of laxity of the romenostomy opening leading to drop of cannula, myiasis on the margin of the stoma site and few cases of mild ruminal content leakage on the long-term assessment. Discussion: Restraint in standing position was considered adequate, although lateral recumbence constitutes another option. However, higher risk of contamination and technical difficulties in placing the cannulas are expected if lateral recumbence is considered. In other trials using acepromazine, no accidental recumbence occurred. Xylazine was also indicated for chemical restraint of buffaloes. It is known that flexible cannulas provide better anatomic adjustment and adaptation as well as being effective for sampling ruminal content, as seen in the current study. Ruminal leakage is one of the most frequent complications of romenostomy, which may affect animal's welfare. The animals in the current study presented no variations on the body score, even though on those presenting cannula loosening or ruminal content leakage. Moreover, no significant changes of the ruminal content parameters were noticed. Myiasis was also reported following ruminal surgical interventions, which were mainly attributed to extensive breeding. Loss of the cannula, subcutaneous emphysema and suture dehiscence are common complications of romenostomy. Nonetheless, none of those complications were found on the current study. Thus, romenostomy was feasible and efficient for sampling and performing assays of the ruminal content in buffaloes...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{analyze the}} effects of {{application}} of 1 % and 3 % insulin-like growth factor I (IGF- 1) cream {{on the process of}} wound healing in induced skin lesions in diabetic and non-diabetic rats and evaluate its effect on expression of myofibroblasts. METHODS: Ninety-six Wistar adult male rats were divided into six groups, with 16 rats in each group, as follows: group 1 : non-diabetic, untreated; group 2 : non-diabetic, treated with 1 % IGF- 1 cream; group 3 : non-diabetic, treated with 3 % IGF- 1 cream; group 4 : diabetic, untreated; group 5 : diabetic, treated with 1 % IGF- 1 cream; and group 6 : diabetic, treated with 3 % IGF- 1 cream. In groups 4, 5, and 6, diabetes was induced by intravenous injection of alloxan. After diabetes had been induced, animals were mantained for 3 months. The experimental procedure consisted of the creation of a <b>circular</b> <b>incision</b> of 0. 9 mm in diameter using a metal punch. Following this, wounds were treated daily according to the assigned treatment regimen. Groups 2 and 5 were treated with 1 % IGF- 1 cream, groups 3 and 6 with 3 % IGF- 1 cream, and groups 1 and 4 and the untreated groups with 0. 9 % saline solution. From each group, samples from 4 rats were taken at three, seven, 14, and 21 days after the injury. Samples were fixed in 10 % formalin to prepare slides for histological analysis. Slides stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Masson were observed vascular proliferation, mononuclear cells, polymorphonuclear cells, fibroblast proliferation, re-epithelialization, and collagen fibers. This study analyzed the expression of &# 945;-smooth muscle actin using specific antibodies to correlate the temporal expression of &# 945;-smooth muscle-specific actin (&# 945;-SM actin), a molecular marker for myofibroblast transformation. RESULTS:Macroscopic observation of wounds showed a more rapid re-epithelialization of wounds treated with IGF. Regarding acute inflammatory reactions, the results of the analysis of vascular proliferation and polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells showed no statistically significant differences in any of the periods studied (according to the results of a Mann-Whitney test). The initial immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples conducted to compare the expression of &# 945;-smooth muscle actin between groups showed a relevant response in the expression of myofibroblasts. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and were found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The topical application of 1 % and 3 % IGF- 1 creams increases the expression of myofibroblasts in the process of wound healing in rats...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2010. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Arthur G. Erdman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 219 pages, appendices A-C. The {{goal of this}} project {{was to develop a}} sterile surgical device for gaining peritoneal cavity access without external incisions via the body's major natural orifices. Such Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) interventions have recently received innovative attention as the next step in minimally-invasive surgery, however, the safety and efficacy depends greatly on sterility. The research for this thesis focused primarily on gastric interventions is divided into four main foci: tensile testing and determination of the most accurate material model for human gastric tissue, FEA analysis of the balloon dilation, experimentally validating these results using a silicone tissue phantom, and the paper design of a theoretical prototype. Tensile testing the human gastric tissue provided the only material properties for the entire stress-strain curve known to the literature to be accurate. A series of tests were conducted on several different freshly donated organs. Statistical analyses were performed comparing the inner and outer layers, and the 0 ° and 90 ° orientation. These results showed that while visually different, the elastic portion of the stress-strain curve showed no statistical differences between layers or orientation. A FE model was created in 2 D axisymmetric and 3 D to determine the minimum size incision needed to dilate large enough to allow passage for the device and endoscope without inducing irreversible damage to the tissue. Conclusions from tensile testing led to the material model being hyperelastic, homogeneous, and isotropic. ABAQUS Explicit was used to model the quasi-steady state problem and to more effectively manage contact definitions in the 3 D simulation. The models were also simulated with a silicone material for experimental validation. Using the same assumptions from the ABAQUS model, a physical experiment was performed with the silicone tissue phantom. From a <b>circular</b> <b>incision</b> of 10 mm, several final diameters were tested. Rigid objects were used to dilate rather than balloons for ease of visualization. The surface had nodal coordinates drawn on the material and digital images taken before and after dilation. Coordinates were extracted using xyExtract. exe, and strains calculated with a user defined MATLAB program. Taking the above work into consideration, three different prototype designs were proposed. All three incorporate dual-donut balloons as the primary means of dilating the initial incision, holding the device in place, and providing a mechanical means for ensuring sterility while maintaining insufflation. The first embodiment simply incorporates dual balloons {{on the end of a}} PTFE sheath. The second utilizes a corkscrew-shaped singular balloon crimped in the middle to form the dual expansion zones. Finally, the last prototype design uses a second outer sheath to encapsulate both balloons which provides the dilatory force to the tissue, and acts as a long cylindrical balloon to stabilize the length of the sheath...|$|E
