50|$|Area cartograms may be {{contiguous}} or noncontiguous. The area cartograms {{shown on}} this page are all contiguous, while {{a good example of}} a noncontiguous <b>cartogram</b> was published in The New York Times.

They introduce a human vision instead of a planimetric one. By applying the Gastner-Newman algorithm for generating density-equalising <b>cartograms</b> to Romania and its Moldova province we can discuss the making of <b>cartograms</b> in general...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cartograms</b> are {{powerful}} tools for visualizing information. Many {{people have seen}} the <b>cartograms</b> created after the 2000 and 2004 US Presidential Election and can attest {{to the power of}} their presentation. Unfortunately, <b>cartograms</b> are too time consuming and difficult to create to be used as common map making tools. Several algorithms for creating <b>cartograms</b> will be reviewed. Implementations as scripts for ArcGIS Desktop 9 will be presented...|$|R
50|$|Two {{common types}} of cartograms: area and {{distance}} <b>cartograms.</b> <b>Cartograms</b> {{have a fairly}} long history, with examples from the mid-1800s.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{software}} packages generate cartograms. Most {{of the available}} <b>cartogram</b> generation tools work {{in conjunction with other}} GIS software tools as add-ons or independently produce cartographic outputs from GIS data formatted to work with commonly used GIS products. Examples of <b>cartogram</b> software include ScapeToad, Cart, and the <b>Cartogram</b> Processing Tool (an ArcScript for ESRI's ArcGIS), which all use the Gastner-Newman algorithm. An alternative algorithm, Carto3F, is also implemented as an independent program for non-commercial use on Windows platforms. This program also provides an optimization to the original Dougenik rubber-sheet algorithm.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{complexity}} of rectangular <b>cartograms,</b> i. e., maps where every region is a rectangle, and which should be deformed such that given area requirements are satisfied. We study the closely related problem of <b>cartograms</b> with orthogonal octagons, and show that this problem is NP-hard. From our proof, it also follows that rectangular <b>cartograms</b> are NP-hard if we allow {{for the existence of}} a “sea”, i. e., a region of arbitrarily high complexity {{on the outside of the}} drawing. ...|$|R
40|$|The author {{argues for}} the {{increased}} use of population <b>cartograms</b> to visualize changing geographies and uses British localities as an example. Population <b>cartograms</b> are increasingly being recognized by researchers as a major solution to many spatial visualization problems. The gross misrepresentation of many groups of people on conventional topographic maps has long been seen as a major problem of thematic cartography, highlighting difficulties such as the modifiable areal unit problem in preventing the development of visual palliatives. Population <b>cartograms</b> made up of many thousands of areal units are simple to construct with an appro pilate algorithm. The author has designed a particular solution for use in the visualization of high-resolution spatial social structure. The problem now is not of writing more computer programs, but of convincing other researchers of the necessity of using <b>cartograms</b> in place of conventional choropleth maps for showing many population-related distributions. The author shows how our pictures of space can be changed and argues why they should be. ...|$|R

40|$|Geographical {{mapping of}} {{infectious}} diseases is an important tool for detecting and characterising outbreaks. Two common mapping methods, dot maps and incidence maps, have important shortcomings. The former does not represent population density and can compromise case privacy, and the latter relies on pre-defined administrative boundaries. We propose a method that overcomes these limitations: dot map <b>cartograms.</b> These create a point pattern of cases while reshaping spatial units, such that spatial area becomes proportional to population size. We compared these dot map <b>cartograms</b> with standard dot maps and incidence maps on four criteria, using two example datasets. Dot map <b>cartograms</b> were able to illustrate both incidence and absolute numbers of cases (criterion 1) : they revealed potential source locations (Q fever, the Netherlands) and clusters with high incidence (pertussis, Germany). Unlike incidence maps, they were insensitive to choices regarding spatial scale (criterion 2). Dot map <b>cartograms</b> ensured the privacy of cases (criterion 3) by spatial distortion; however, this occurred {{at the expense of}} recognition of locations (criterion 4). We demonstrate that dot map <b>cartograms</b> are a valuable method for detection and visualisation of infectious disease outbreaks, which facilitates informed and appropriate actions by public health professionals, to investigate and control outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|We present {{rectangular}} hierarchical <b>cartograms</b> for mapping socio-economic data. These density-normalising <b>cartograms</b> size spatial units by population, {{increasing the}} ease with which data for densely populated areas can be visually resolved compared to more conventional cartographic projections. Their hierarchical nature enables the study of spatial granularity in spatial hierarchies, hierarchical categorical data and multivariate data through false hierarchies. They are space-ﬁlling representations that make efﬁcient use of space and their rectangular nature (which aims to be as square as possible) improves the ability to compare the sizes (therefore population) of geographical units. We demonstrate these <b>cartograms</b> by mapping the Ofﬁce for National Statistics Output Area Classiﬁcation (OAC) by unit postcode (1. 52 million in Great Britain) through the postcode hierarchy, using these to explore spatial variation. We provide rich and detailed spatial summaries of socio-economic characteristics of population as types of treemap, exploring the effects of reconﬁguring them to study spatial and non-spatial aspects of the OAC classiﬁcation...|$|R

Information Technology has {{enhanced the}} visualization of data, {{beyond the traditional}} aspects, {{to such an extent}} that we can nowadays speak of an "image society". Traditional thematic mapping also shows transformations of a variable over time, linking the geographical datum to the time variable. For some decades now a number of <b>cartograms</b> have been in use, for which the base area is displaced as a function of a particular factor, these are known as anamorphic <b>cartograms.</b> An anamorphic map is easier to read and may give an overview of a geographic whole...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{poster of}} {{scientific}} popularization was prepared {{within the framework}} of the 2017 edition of the Innovative SHS fair which took place in Marseille (France). It shows the interest in using <b>cartograms</b> to portray the socio-residential segregation at an infra-metropolitan scale. <b>Cartograms</b> have long been used by cartographers (Brunet, 1987) and are widely present in the media. They are most of the time intended to challenge the reader, to report a phenomenon or a fact (elections, poverty, pollution, etc.) in a meaningful way at a country or worldwide scale. Through this poster, we show that <b>cartograms</b> are also well adapted to highlight the uneven distribution of the households following their socioeconomic level in a city, here Bogotá (Colombia). The spatial units (census blocks) were deformed according to the households’ number classified according to a social condition index widely used in Latin America. This index was calculated from the 2005 census microdata {{within the framework of}} the program "METAL: metropolises of Latin America in the globalization: territorial reconfigurations, spatial mobility, public action", granted by the ANR (French National Research Agency) and supervised by F. Dureau (IRD – MIGRINTER Lab, UMR 7301 CNRS - University of Poitiers...|$|R
50|$|Some maps, called <b>cartograms,</b> {{have the}} scale {{deliberately}} distorted to reflect information other than land area or distance.

40|$|Computers are {{not only}} used in {{cartography}} to produce electronic versions of conventional manual methods. Some types of map projections also draw on their computing power, which {{makes it possible to}} produce extremely useful innovations, such as anamorphic <b>cartograms.</b> The method described consists in transforming the surface of geographical entities depending on a chosen variable. Using a topographic base transformed in this way to map the population, the analysis focuses on the municipalities of the Pays de la Loire and the Centre region, then changes scale with a map projection {{of the results of the}} presidential election of 2002. While disorganising the usual geographical points of reference, <b>cartograms</b> have a place in semiotics and warrant special attention for their contribution to our knowledge of space...|$|R
