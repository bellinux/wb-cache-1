5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are nothing more than an effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> them is unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{opposed the}} {{creation}} of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a noble order unwelcome in the newly independent Republic, contrary to the ideals of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, for whom the Society was named; his reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.|$|E

5|$|Baseball {{has certain}} {{attributes}} that set it {{apart from the}} other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none {{of them is the}} variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of Rapunzel has been generally positive, with critics complimenting her spirited, lively personality and independence. The tenth Disney Princess, Rapunzel was officially {{inducted into the}} line-up on October 2, 2011, becoming the franchise's first computer-animated member. Her physical appearance and personality have drawn much <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> her and preceding Disney Princess Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), by whom she was inspired.|$|E
5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only believe their religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they {{interact with each other}} and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E

5|$|There are {{concerns}} raised about possible contribution from urban heat islands to global warming. Research on China indicates that urban heat island effect contributes to climate warming by about 30%. On the other hand, one 1999 <b>comparison</b> <b>between</b> {{urban and rural}} areas proposed that the urban heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends. Many studies reveal increases in the severity of the effect with the progress of climate change.|$|E
