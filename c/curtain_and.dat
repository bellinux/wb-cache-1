5|$|In 1902 {{the theatre}} closed {{for nine months}} to enable {{extensive}} building work {{to be carried out}} in accordance with the terms of the Royal Charter. This involved a new staircase, the installation of electric lighting, a new fire <b>curtain</b> <b>and</b> hot water radiators throughout the auditorium. In 1905, on the anniversary of the opening of the Theatre Royal, numerous William Shakespeare's plays were performed by the company of actors led by Frank Benson.|$|E
30|$|Thus, this {{research}} models the smoke <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> ceiling signboards as parametric {{elements in the}} Revit model. Among predefined system family types in Revit, the Wall element is most appropriate for modeling parametric smoke <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> ceiling signboards. By means of modifying several Wall properties, such as base constraint, base offset, top constraint, top offset, and thickness, the appearance of Wall elements can resemble smoke <b>curtains</b> <b>and</b> ceiling signboards. The elements with different locations, heights and sizes can be easily and parametrically modeled in the BIM model.|$|R

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron <b>Curtain</b> <b>and</b> the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of control has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E
5|$|Homer's {{escape from}} the {{overturned}} paddy wagon is a homage to the 1993 film The Fugitive. Chief Wiggum's dream in which Lisa speaks backwards is reference to Twin Peaks and Special Agent Dale Cooper's interaction with the Man from Another Place. While recording Lisa's lines for the segment, Yeardley Smith recorded the part backwards; the recording was in turn reversed, a technique known as phonetic reversal, the same technique used on Twin Peaks. Several other parts out of the segment are direct references to the dream, including a moving shadow on the <b>curtain,</b> <b>and</b> Wiggum's hair standing straight up after waking.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prepared}} speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron <b>Curtain</b> <b>and</b> {{the free and}} unfree Internet.

In July 2010, she visited Korea, Vietnam, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all the while preparing for the July 31 wedding of daughter Chelsea amid much media attention.|$|E

British authorities attempted to contact his relatives in Lithuania, but Lithuania—as a Soviet Socialist Republic— {{was behind the}} Iron <b>Curtain,</b> <b>and</b> they were advised to stop these attempts since his relatives might suffer negative consequences. At the time Soviet authorities saw those people who maintained contacts with the West as untrustworthy.|$|E
5|$|Heavily {{built and}} {{characteristically}} smooth, the pectoral fin disc of the short-tail stingray has a rather angular, rhomboid shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal <b>curtain</b> <b>and</b> outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E
5|$|Mir {{featured}} a shower, the Bania, located in Kvant-2. It was an improvement on the units installed in previous Salyut stations, but proved {{difficult to use}} due to {{the time required to}} set up, use, and stow. The shower, which {{featured a}} plastic <b>curtain</b> <b>and</b> fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room; it eventually had its plumbing removed and the space was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container, or using a washbasin equipped with a plastic hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.|$|E

5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{study from}} life, {{depicting}} {{a black and}} a white wrestler grappling. Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched; this was unusual for the time, {{as it was a}} common belief in Britain in this period that black people were physically weaker than whites. Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces. The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a loincloth, although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death. The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies, as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple. The figures are set against a dark green <b>curtain</b> <b>and</b> a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.|$|E
5|$|There are varying {{accounts}} whether Leigh was in {{the shower}} the entire time or a body double was used for {{some parts of the}} murder sequence and its aftermath. In an interview with Roger Ebert and in the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Leigh stated she {{was in the}} scene the entire time and Hitchcock used a stand-in only for the sequence in which Norman wraps Marion's body in a shower <b>curtain</b> <b>and</b> places it in the trunk of her car. The 2010 book The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock's Shower by Robert Graysmith contradicts this, identifying Marli Renfro as Leigh's body double for some of the shower scene's shots. Graysmith also stated that Hitchcock later acknowledged Renfro's participation in the scene.|$|E
5|$|Various {{technological}} and aesthetic {{changes have been}} made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a <b>curtain</b> <b>and</b> featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount {{on one side and the}} clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall, which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.|$|E
