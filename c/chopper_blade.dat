40|$|Crushed {{oil palm}} fruit bunches from the {{continuous}} sterilization system cause damages and bruising of the fruits, yielding high lipase enzyme reaction if no heating pre-treatment {{was carried out}} immediately. Thus, this study was proposed to acquire the free fatty acid content (FFA) release rate and to determine the mechanical properties of chopped oil palm fruit spikelets. The fruit spikelets were chopped by using two different methods, which were manually chopping using a knife blade and utilizing a fabricated <b>chopper</b> <b>blade.</b> Damages obtained from the manually chopped using the knife blade were classified into two categories, which were minor and major damage. The <b>chopper</b> <b>blade</b> was fixed on the Instron Machine to obtain its mechanical properties, such as rupture force, deformation at rupture, hardness and energy at the break of the fruit spikelets. The chopped fruit spikelets were stored at different storage periods ranging between 0 hr to 2 hr at room temperature. Extraction of palm oil was extracted using the Soxhlet extractor and the FFA content of the palm oil was determined through titration method. Results showed that the mean rupture force, deformation at rupture, hardness and energy at break required when chopping the fruit spikelets were 2781 N, 45. 53 mm, 61. 02 N/mm and 36. 71 J respectively. The development of FFA content was highly influenced by the damaged area of the fruits {{and the length of}} storage periods. This is due to the development of lipase enzyme activity that occurred in the damage...|$|E

40|$|As {{described}} in the previous paper (Park et al. 2013), the detector subsystem of optical wide-field patrol (OWL) provides many observational data points of a single artificial satellite or space debris {{in the form of}} small streaks, using a chopper system and a time tagger. The position and the corresponding time data are matched assuming that the length of a streak on the CCD frame is proportional to the time duration of the exposure during which the <b>chopper</b> <b>blades</b> do not obscure the CCD window. In the previous study, however, the length was measured using the diagonal of the rectangle of the image area containing the streak; the results were quite ambiguous and inaccurate, allowing possible matching error of positions and time data. Furthermore, because only one (position, time) data point is created from one streak, the efficiency of the observation decreases. To define the length of a streak correctly, it is important to locate the endpoints of a streak. In this paper, a method using a differential convolution mask pattern is tested. This method can be used to obtain the positions where the pixel values are changed sharply. These endpoints can be regarded as directly detected positional data, and the number of data points is doubled by this result...|$|R

Two additional channels which measure spectrally integrated solar and solar plus thermal radiation are used to determine the planetary radiation budget components. The PPR photopolarimetric measurements utilize previously flown technology for high-precision polarimetry using a calcite Wollaston prism and two silicon photodiodes to enable simultaneous detection of the two orthogonal polarization components.

40|$|A new {{wavelength}} modulator {{based on}} a custom-made <b>chopper</b> <b>blade</b> and a slit placed in the Fourier plane of a pulse shaper was used to detect explicitly the first derivative of the time-resolved femtosecond stimulated Raman spectroscopy (FSRS) signals. This approach resulted in an unprecedented reduction of the non-coherent background that results from population transfer by the Raman pump inherent to FSRS experiments. The method of Fourier peak filtering was implemented as {{a powerful tool for}} reducing both the remaining non-coherent and coherent background associated with FSRS experiments. The method was demonstrated on β-carotene and a similar synthetic aryl carotenoid. The experiments confirm earlier FSRS results on β-carotene but suggest some reinterpretation. Strong bleaching signals of ground state vibrations were observed and interpreted as an inseparable part of the time-resolved FSRS experiment. New long-lived Raman features were observed in β-carotene and the synthetic aryl carotenoid and assigned to a combination of conformational changes and solvent rearrangement.

40|$|The {{demand and}} {{application}} of composites are increasing nowadays. Composite materials {{in the form of}} plate or plate-like structures are widely used in wind turbine blades and ship building due to its high specific strength and stiffness. For high thermal applications, Functionally Graded Materials (FGM) are used in preference to laminated composites because of its good performance in the thermal field. The pre-twisted cantilever plates have major use in turbine blades, fan <b>blades,</b> compressor <b>blades,</b> <b>chopper</b> <b>blades,</b> marine propellers and chiefly in gas turbines. These structures are often subjected to thermal environments, and hence FGMs are a good alternative to metal plates. The present work deals with the study of buckling analysis of cantilever twisted functionally graded material plates. The analysis is done by using ANSYS, and the results are validated using ABAQUS. A SHELL- 281 element having six degrees of freedom per node is employed in ANSYS. The functionally graded material plate with a uniform variation of the material property through the thickness is estimated as a laminated section containing number of layers, and each layer is taken as isotropic. The power law is used to determine material properties in each layer. From convergence studies, ten by ten mesh and twelve number of layers are found to give good accuracy.

40|$|The use of Pyroelectric array {{detectors}} in Infrared {{cameras in}} the 8 to 14 µm region necessitates a means for area-modulation, or chopping of the infrared scene, thus generating an element of change for measurement by the detector. Currently this is achieved by mechanically chopping the image using a rotating blade, with drawbacks of high electric motor power, blurring as camera motion changes the rotational speed, and the <b>chopper</b> <b>blade</b> largely determining the camera diameter. Adequate modulation using a novel method has been achieved in the 8 to 14 µm region by introducing moderate levels of excess carriers to suitably prepared Germanium. These were introduced via excitation from a diode laser source. The process described uses inter valence band trasitions from the light-hole to heavy-hole band, requiring power densitities {{in the order of}} Watts cm- 2. Modulation of from 44 % to 6 % transmission at 10 µm using a power density of 28. 6 W cm 2 from an AlGaAs 809 nm laser is easily achievable. The on state transmission will then be then increased to essentially 100 % by using anti-reflection coatings. We will describe the relative importance of the bulk and surface properties; high bulk purity and low surface recombination velocities being required to make an effective device, although operation is possible with lower quality material. The most suitable material for the device is low carrier density n-Germanium.

40|$|Uncooled {{thermal imaging}} {{cameras in the}} 8 to 14 µm band use pyroelectric array {{detectors}} as the preferred technology. The systems advantages offered by these uncooled detectors are those of reduced cost, complexity and power consumption. The price paid for this uncooled technology is that the image must be modulated in order to generate a change in signal intensity on the detector. Currently this is achieved using a rotating <b>chopper</b> <b>blade,</b> which introduces moving parts to the system, and has the drawbacks of size and image degradation as camera motion changes the blade's rotational speed. A need has existed for considerable time for solid state broad optical bandwidth modulation in the infrared. The application requires modulation of the 8 to 14 µm band with high 'on' state transmission, although not necessarily a very low 'off' state transmission. Crucially this must be over a relatively large (1 cm 2) aperture. The modulator should be insensitive to polarisation since this would halve the image intensity from a randomly polarised scene, reducing the system signal to noise ratio. Low power consumption, compactness, and the incorporation into a low f-number optical system are the systems requirements for this application. The specification is eased only by the moderate chopping frequencies (< 100 Hz) characteristic of pyroelectric detector operation. Adequate modulation using a novel method has been achieved in the 8 to 14 µm region by introducing moderate levels of excess carriers to suitably prepared germanium by excitation from a diode laser source. The process utilises inter valence band transitions from the light-hole to heavy-hole band, requiring excitation power densities {{in the order of}} Watts cm- 2. This has been exploited by the construction of the first solid state modulator satisfying the requirements of thermal imaging cameras in the 8 to 14 µm band. A depth of modulation of from 95. 4 % (AR coated) to 4. 7 % transmission at 10 µm using a total power density of 5. 6 Wcm- 2 from 980 nm diode lasers has been achieved in the centre of a 1 cm 2 aperture. The 'on' state loss at this wavelength is limited by the single-layer quarter-wavelength AR coating properties, and may be eliminated through use of a multilayer coating. There is presently no solid state modulator in the required thermal image band that even approaches this performance. The possibility of using electrical pumping to generate the required holes for the induced absorption is investigated. The design of an electrical-injection area-based modulator, modulating radiation perpendicular to the junction plane is affected by the conflicting requirements of uniform absorption across the aperture and high 'on' state transmission. A design for such a device is outlined. Modulation of a beam of radiation parallel to the junction plane is demonstrated by a reconfigured p-n junction diode to illustrate the principle. <br/...|$|E
50|$|Modern Chinese knives {{are sold}} under three general classifications {{throughout}} China: Caidao (slicers), choppers and Gudao (cleavers). The general distinction {{lies in the}} thickness of the <b>blade.</b> <b>Choppers</b> are the most common all-purpose Chinese knife. <b>Choppers</b> have thicker <b>blades</b> than slicers but are not as thick and heavy as cleavers. Choppers are used for slicing, chopping and mincing meat, vegetables and herbs. Choppers are suitable for chopping through thin soft bones such as fish and poultry. Slicers, referred to as Caidao (vegetable knives) by the Chinese have the thinnest and sharpest blades. Slicers may have the same shape as choppers or they may have less width and appear similar to Japanese Nakiri knives. Slicers are used for cutting vegetables, mincing herbs and slicing thin strips of meat for stir frying. The thin blade makes slicers unsuitable for chopping any bones. Cleavers, which are referred to as bone choppers by the Chinese have thick heavy blades. In Chinese homes, cleavers are typically used for chopping up pork ribs or for preparing hard-shelled seafood such as lobsters.|$|R

Often they are subjected to thermal environments,and thus FGMs are a decent option to metal plates. Composite structures with cut-outs are usually employed in engineering structures. In structural components cut-outs are provided sometimes to lighten the structure and for proper ventilation. Cut-outs in aircraft components (for example,fuselage,ribs and wing spar) are required for inspection,access,fuel lines and electric lines or to minimize the general weight of the aircraft. Study of buckling of cantilever twisted functionally graded material plates with and without holes and with varying applied in-plane loads is dealt in the present work.

40|$|AbstractCurrent rotary <b>blade</b> <b>choppers</b> for {{sugarcane}} harvesting {{have the}} disadvantage of becoming clogged with leaves/cane around the rotating blades causing them to hit the ground and rocks that result in rapid blade wear and tear. Dull blades require repeated cane cutting attempts causing damage to the cane and increasing the cutting force and energy requirements. Thus, the search for alternative, non-contact, cutting options such as waterjet (WJ) cutting has been undertaken. The results indicated that WJ cutting has potential but weaknesses have also been reported. Hence, this study explored the use of abrasive fine sand (AWJ) to overcome the weaknesses of the pure WJ cutting application. Using the Hoogstrate model and a MATLAB program, AWJ cutting simulation was performed using an orifice and nozzle diameter combination of 0. 25 and 0. 76  mm at 360  MPa water pressure, respectively, which produced a water flow rate of 1. 6  L/min and a power input of 15  kW. Other parameters used in the test included: 80  mesh fine river sand abrasive materials, a specific cutting energy of 8. 7  ×  10 − 3  J/mm 3 and a fitted cutting efficiency of 0. 35. The experimental results revealed that the system was able to cut sugarcane stalks completely at a much farther standoff distance by reducing the traverse speed. The study also showed that cutting sugarcane of 30 and 120  mm diameters would require a traverse speed of 4. 4  km/h and 1. 1  km/h, respectively.
