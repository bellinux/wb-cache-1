5|$|With Kate {{convicted for}} Pope's murder, Merc plans {{a way for}} Faith to ambush the police convoy {{transporting}} her to prison, and Faith helps to free Kate. She gives Kate her <b>comms</b> unit that she and Merc use and tells her that he will guide her back to his hideout. When Faith returns to the hideout, she finds it in ruins, with Merc dying and Kate recaptured. In his dying words, Merc tells Faith that Kate {{is now at the}} Shard, which contains Mayor Callaghan's office and the servers that run the city's surveillance systems. With Miller's help, Faith is able to enter the Mayor's private offices, and destroys the servers that will unlock the rooftop security door. She gains access to the roof, but Miller is killed. On the roof, she finds Kate held at gunpoint by Jacknife. Jacknife reveals that he too is part of Project Icarus, and {{has been part of the}} plan all along to lure the Runners out of hiding. When Jacknife tries to take Kate onto a waiting helicopter, Faith jumps on before it can leave, knocking Jacknife out of the helicopter to fall to his death but also damaging the helicopter in the process. Faith helps Kate to escape safely from the falling helicopter.|$|E

500|$|The upgrade {{programme}} {{resulted in}} the Sea King AEW fleet being upgraded with a new mission system, <b>Comms,</b> NavAids, JTIDS, Active Noise Reduction and Videographic recording. [...] The Mission System Upgrade (MSU) component (Radar and partial JTIDS integration) was based around the improved Searchwater 2000AEW radar, with an all-new man Machine Interface. [...] This MSU component was later termed [...] "Project Cerberus" [...] by Thales, after successful integration was conducted by Westland and GEC-Marconi. This variant was initially {{referred to as the}} Sea King AEW7, but renamed ASaC7 just before In Service Date. [...] (Airborne Surveillance and Control Mk.7). The main role of the Sea King ASaC7 is detection of low-flying attack aircraft; it also provides interception/attack control and over-the-horizon targeting for surface-launched weapon systems. In comparison to older versions, the new radar enables the ASaC7 to simultaneously track up to 400 targets, instead of an earlier limit of 250 targets. The effectiveness of the AEW7 was greatly increased via the addition of a Link 16 data link, allowing gathered radar information to be analysed and rapidly put to use by multiple allied platforms in range.|$|E

50|$|Drosophila Commissureless (<b>Comm)</b> is a {{transmembrane protein}} {{expressed}} in commissural neurons. <b>Comm</b> promotes midline crossing by down-regulating Robo. A LPSY sorting signal motif {{has been shown}} to be required for <b>Comm</b> to sort Robo to endosomes, preventing it from accessing the surface of the growth cone. Thus, when <b>Comm</b> is expressed, axons are unaffected by the presence of Slit and are able to cross the midline. <b>Comm</b> expression is tightly regulated to ensure that axons down-regulate Robo at the correct time. In the absence of <b>Comm,</b> Robo is not appropriately down-regulated and all axons fail to cross the midline.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Drosophila melanogaster, commissureless (<b>comm)</b> {{function}} {{is required for}} proper nerve cord development. Although <b>comm</b> orthologs have not been identified outside of Drosophila species, some insects possess orthologs of Drosophila <b>comm</b> 2, which may also regulate embryonic nerve cord development. Here, this hypothesis is explored through characterization of <b>comm</b> 2 genes in two disease vector mosquitoes. RESULTS: Culex quinquefasciatus (West Nile and lymphatic filiariasis vector) has three <b>comm</b> 2 genes that are expressed in the developing nerve cord. Aedes aegypti (dengue and yellow fever vector) has a single <b>comm</b> 2 gene that is expressed in commissural neurons projecting axons toward the midline. Loss of <b>comm</b> 2 function in both A. aegypti and D. melanogaster was found to result in loss of commissure defects that phenocopy the frazzled (fra) loss of function phenotypes observed in both species. Loss of fra function in either insect was found to result in decreased <b>comm</b> 2 transcript levels during nerve cord development. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this investigation suggest that Fra down-regulates repulsion in precrossing commissural axons by regulating <b>comm</b> 2 levels in both A. aegypti and D. melanogaster, both of which require <b>Comm</b> 2 function for proper nerve cord development...|$|R

These components are neatly twisted into a multistrand cable, and are deployed as a single unit. The diver's end has underwater connectors for the electrical cables, and the air hoses are usually connected to the helmet, band mask, or bailout block by JIC fittings. A screw-gate carabiner or similar connector is provided on the strength member for attachment to the diver's harness, and may be used to lift the diver in an emergency. Similar connections are provided for attachment to the diving bell, if used, or to the surface gas panel and communications equipment.|$|E
