50|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1980s, the Fermenta stock price rose steadily, which allowed El-Sayed to embark on a {{campaign}} of acquisition. In early 1985, he notably bought Pierrel from Italian industrial Vittorio de Nora. Pierrel's activities were diversified; they included pharmacy, with the production of antibiotics, chemicals, with aspartam, etc... El-Sayed's plan was to retain only the activities he was interested in, and to sell other operations for a profit. Through this campaign of acquisition, he was hoping to turn Fermenta into a giant in the biotechnology sector. Just after taking the control of Pierrel, El-Sayed presented his new board of directors, which included big names of the Swedish business scene, such as Ove Sundberg from KemaNobel, GÃ¶sta Bystedt and Simon Liliedahl <b>from</b> <b>Electrolux,</b> and advertising guru Leon Nordin.|$|R
