25|$|Since the {{fraction}} of a radioisotope's atoms decaying per unit of time is inversely proportional to its half-life, the relative radioactivity of a quantity of buried human radioactive waste would diminish over time compared to natural radioisotopes (such as the decay chain of 120 trillion tons of thorium and 40 trillion tons of uranium which are at relatively trace concentrations of parts per million each over the crust's 3 ton mass). For instance, over a timeframe of thousands of years, after the most active short half-life radioisotopes decayed, burying U.S. nuclear waste would increase the radioactivity in the top 2000 feet of rock and soil in the United States (10 million km2) by ≈ 1 part in 10 million over the <b>cumulative</b> <b>amount</b> of natural radioisotopes in such a volume, although {{the vicinity of the}} site would have a far higher concentration of artificial radioisotopes underground than such an average.|$|E

The official music video for the song was uploaded on 5 September to the band's YouTube channel. The song had significant chart performance by peaking in the top 40 in several countries.

40|$|Poultry litter (PL) is a {{traditionally}} inexpensive and effective fertilizer to improve soil quality and agricultural productivity. However, over application to soil has raised concern because excess nutrients in runoff could accelerate the eutrophication of fresh water. In this work, we determined {{the contents of}} total phosphorus (P), Mehlich 3 extracted P, total nitrogen (N), ammonium (NH 4) -N, and nitrate (NO 3) -N, in pasture soils receiving annual poultry litter applications of 0, 2. 27, 2. 27, 3. 63, and 1. 36 Mg/ha/ yr, respectively, for 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. Samples were collected from three soil depths (0 – 20, 20 – 40, and 40 – 60 cm) of the Hartsells series (fine-loamy, siliceous, subactive, thermic, Typic Hapludults) on a 3 – 8 % slope in the Sand Mountain region of north Alabama. PL application increased levels of total P, Mehlich- 3 extractable P, and total N significantly. However, the change in NH 4 -N and NO 3 -N contents by the PL application was not statistically significant. Correlation analysis indicated that the contents of total P, Mehlich 3 extracted P, and total N were more related to <b>cumulative</b> <b>amounts</b> of poultry litter applied than the years of application or annual application rates alone. This observation suggested that N and P from poultry litter accumulated in soil. Predicting the build-up based on the <b>cumulative</b> <b>amounts</b> of PL application, rather than isolated factors (i. e., application year or rate), would improve the accuracy of evaluating long-term impacts of poultry litter application on soil nutrient levels...|$|R
40|$|Hyaluronan (HA) is a {{well-known}} active ingredient for cosmetic and drug applications. However, based on its varying molecular size, HA may have limited skin permeation. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} present study was to investigate the in vitro skin permeability of HA tetrasaccharide (HA 4). In addition, the effects of HA 4 on in vivo skin barrier function were examined. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>amounts</b> of HA 4 through stratum corneum (SC) -stripped skin and full-thickness skin after 8 h were 2, 109. 6 and 0. 8 μg/cm 2, respectively. Furthermore, the <b>cumulative</b> <b>amounts</b> of HA 4 permeated after 8 h were 784. 4 ng/cm 2 for a HA 4 solution with a pH 4 and 70. 0 ng/cm 2 with a pH 7 on full-thickness skin. Next, the in vivo effects of HA 4 on the water content of the SC and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) were investigated. The dorsal skins of hairless mice were irradiated to a UVA dose of 22. 3 J/cm 2 /d, 5 times a week. In the control group, the water content of the SC was decreased and TEWL and epidermal thickness were increased with UVA irradiation than the normal group. However, the water content of the SC was increased in the HA 4 group than that of the control group in the non-UVA irradiation groups. In addition, the water content of the SC was increased and TEWL and epidermal thickness were decreased in the HA 4 group than those of the control and HA groups. These results suggest that treatment with HA 4 improved skin functional recovery after UVA irradiation by skin penetration of HA 4. Copyright ? 2012, Springer-Verla...|$|R
