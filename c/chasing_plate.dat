50|$|NASCAR 2001 was {{the final}} game that {{featured}} Dale Earnhardt as a regular full-time driver, prior to his death in the 2001 Daytona 500 (which would reappear in NASCAR SimRacing with his 1999 car and in NASCAR 07 as an unlockable <b>Chase</b> <b>Plate</b> and Earnhardt appears in NASCAR Thunder 2003 {{as the result of}} a cheat code). Johnny Benson is also absent in this game, while it was the first NASCAR game to include Jimmy Spencer, Jerry Nadeau, and Elliott Sadler. The drivers Michael Waltrip, Kenny Irwin Jr., Richard Petty and Adam Petty do not participate in any of the races as a computer opponent, instead the player must be the driver.|$|R
50|$|The Dodge Challenges, {{formerly}} the Lightning Challenge {{of the previous}} three games, return with {{a new set of}} challenges. This mode allows users to relive NASCAR moments of 2004 and first part of 2005. Kenny Wallace, driver of the No. 22 Stacker 2 Ford in the Busch Series, is the commentator for all the challenges, replacing Michael Waltrip who had done it the last two games. Once a challenge is completed, the player will receive skill points that they can use to unlock <b>Chase</b> <b>Plates,</b> formerly Thunder Plates of the previous games as well, ranging from simple tasks such as holding off other drivers for the win, to hard tasks such as helping teammates reach the top ten.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, {{the door}} opened, {{and a girl}} rather above than under fifteen years old, entered with a platter, covered with damask, on which was placed a small saucer of the dried plums which have always added to the {{reputation}} of Tours, {{and a cup of}} the curiously <b>chased</b> <b>plate</b> which the goldsmiths of that city were anciently famous for executing with a delicacy of workmanship that distinguished them from the other cities of France, and even excelled the skill of the metropolis. The form of the goblet was so elegant that Durward thought not of observing closely whether the material was of silver, or like what had been placed before himself, of a baser metal, but so well burnished as to resemble the richer ore.|$|R

60|$|Within, the {{dwelling}} was {{a combination}} of the old Italian palace with English comforts. Mr. White, in his joy at possessing his graceful lady wife, had spared no expense in making it a meet bower for her, and Geraldine was as much amused as fascinated by the exquisiteness of all around her; as she sat, in a most luxurious chair, looking out through the open window at the blue sea, yet with a lively wood fire burning under a beauteous mantelpiece; statues, pictures, all that was recherche around, while they drank their English tea out of almost transparently delicate cups, filled by Maura out of a beautifully <b>chased</b> service of <b>plate</b> on a marble mosaic table.|$|R
6000|$|We know nothing, to the regret of bibliophiles, of Moliere's {{taste in}} bindings. Did {{he have a}} comic mask stamped on the leather (that device was <b>chased</b> on his <b>plate),</b> or did he display his {{cognizance}} and arms, the two apes that support a shield charged with three mirrors of Truth? It is certain--La Bruyere tells us as much--that the sillier sort of book-lover {{in the seventeenth century}} was much the same sort of person as his successor in our own time. [...] "A man tells me he has a library," [...] says La Bruyere (De la Mode); [...] "I ask permission to see it. I go to visit my friend, and he receives me in a house where, even on the stairs, the smell of the black morocco with which his books are covered is so strong that I nearly faint. He does his best to revive me; shouts in my ear that the volumes 'have gilt edges,' that they are 'elegantly tooled,' that they are 'of the good edition,' [...] . and informs me that 'he never reads,' that 'he never sets foot in this part of his house,' that he 'will come to oblige me!' I thank him for all his kindness, and have no more desire than himself to see the tanner's shop that he calls his library." ...|$|R
