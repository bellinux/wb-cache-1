5000|$|The UAW-Ford 500 {{was held}} on October 8 at the newly repaved Talladega Superspeedway. Considered the wild <b>card</b> <b>track</b> in the Chase, all drivers fear {{that they will be}} caught in [...] "The Big One." [...] The 2005 winner was Dale Jarrett who missed the chase this year. The {{defending}} track champion was Jimmie Johnson. The race {{was held on}}e week later than in 2005. At this year's event, David Gilliland won his first career Bud Pole Award, and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. led the most laps. In a wild finish, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. led going into turn 3 on the final lap, with Jimmie Johnson and Brian Vickers trailing. Johnson moved down low to pass Earnhardt, and his teammate Vickers followed, but accidentally caught the right rear quarter panel of Johnson's Chevrolet. Johnson spun up into Earnhardt's car, sending both of them down into the infield grass. Vickers moved past and took his first career victory, amid boos from Earnhardt's and Johnson's fans.|$|E

50|$|BlackPOS infects {{computers}} {{running on}} Windows operating {{systems that have}} credit card readers connected to them and {{are part of a}} POS system. POS system computers can be easily infected if {{they do not have the}} most up to date operating systems and antivirus programs to prevent security breaches or if the computer database systems have weak administration login credentials. BlackPOS is a standard memory-scraping malware, with exception that the virus is only limited to the pos.exe files in the infected POS system. Once the desired POS system is infected, the malware pinpoints the process corresponded with the card reader and steals payment <b>card</b> <b>Track</b> 1 and Track 2 data, the information stored on the magnetic strip of payment cards, from its system's memory. Once stolen, the information can be cloned onto blank credit cards to be sold for black market use or used for personal reasons. This results in the consumer personal information being compromised and usable by anyone with access to the information. Unlike other POS malware, such as the vSkimmer, BlackPOS does not have an offline data extraction method, as the captured information is uploaded to a remote server online. This makes it easier for hackers as they do not need to be in the proximity of the infected systems to retrieve consumer information. Furthermore, hackers may try hide the virus from detection by programming BlackPOS to only send stolen information during certain time frames. By doing so, they can mask the traffic the information creates during normal work hours, making it seem as if nothing suspicious is going on.|$|E

50|$|The University of Vermont has a {{long history}} toward {{operational}} environmental sustainability on its campus. In 1995, the Environmental Council at UVM was established to fill a gap regarding a bridge between operations and academics on campus greening issues. The first Council project was to hear presentations from the various environmental programs on campus to provide a baseline scan of campus operation environmental impact. Greening UVM was published in 1998 by the Council to establish a baseline on the environmental impact of the campus' operations. During the same year, a Recycled Paper Policy was created and was implemented in 1999. As a community stakeholder in the Lab-XL project, the Environmental Council received an EPA grant to support the Tracking UVM project and publication to assess relative environmental impact and community interest in laboratory chemical waste. Tracking UVM, a follow-up to the Greening UVM report, was published in 2002 and reported on the environmental progress of the university from 1990 to 2000. The University of Vermont's commitment to tracking its environmental performance was recognized in 2004 with Vermont's Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence for this 2002 environmental report <b>card.</b> <b>Tracking</b> UVM {{is one of the first}} report <b>cards</b> that <b>track</b> the environmental impact of campus operations in an institution of higher education.|$|R
