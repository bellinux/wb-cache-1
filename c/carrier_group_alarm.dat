50|$|These {{alarm states}} are also lumped under the term <b>Carrier</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Alarm</b> (CGA). The meaning of CGA is that {{connectivity}} on the digital carrier has failed. The {{result of the}} CGA condition varies depending on the equipment function. Voice equipment typically coerces the robbed bits for signaling to a state {{that will result in}} the far end properly handling the condition, while applying an often different state to the customer equipment connected to the alarmed equipment. Simultaneously, the customer data is often coerced to a 0x7F pattern, signifying a zero-voltage condition on voice equipment. Data equipment usually passes whatever data may be present, if any, leaving it to the customer equipment to deal with the condition.|$|E

50|$|Middle 20th century analog carrier systems had <b>Carrier</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Alarms</b> {{by which}} {{the failure of a}} pilot signal was alerted to {{telephone}} exchange equipment, imposing an automated make-busy condition so the trunks carried by the failed system would not be used. The improved AIS originated with the T-carrier system, and became a standard feature of subsequent plesiochronous and synchronous circuit-based communication systems, and is also part of the ATM standards.As the use of Ethernet for long-distance data links has increased, the need for a similar end-to-end OA&M function has {{led to the development of}} a similar Ethernet alarm indication signal (EthAIS).|$|R
