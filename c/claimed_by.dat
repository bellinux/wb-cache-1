5|$|Schleswig and Holstein {{were two}} territories fought over between Prussia and Denmark during the First and Second Schleswig Wars. In the latter, Prussia and Austria {{defeated}} Denmark, but the duchies were <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> Austria for the Prince Christian's family. However, following the Austro-Prussian War, in which Prussia invaded and occupied the duchies, they became Prussian, but the title Duke of Schleswig-Holstein was still <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> Prince Christian's family.|$|E

5|$|The notable {{exception}} to this was when land was <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> the Connecticut-based owners of the Susquehanna Company, who had been granted titles to land <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> Connecticut in the Wyoming Valley, {{in an area that}} is now Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The area was also <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> Pennsylvania, which refused to recognize the Connecticut titles. Allen, after being promised land, traveled to the area and began stirring up not just Pennsylvania authorities but also his long-time nemesis, Governor Clinton of New York, by proposing that a new state be carved out of the disputed area and several counties of New York. The entire affair was more bluster than anything else, and was resolved amicably when Pennsylvania agreed to honor the Connecticut titles.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Edward Edwards {{discovered}} the atoll in 1791, Ducie {{was not considered}} a British possession. In 1867 Ducie was <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> the United States under the Guano Islands Act, which established that an uninhabited territory with guano deposits could be claimed as a US possession, {{so long as it}} was unclaimed by any other country. Despite claims on several other territories, based on various documents such as the Guano Islands Act, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom recognised the sovereignty <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> each other. Neither of the two considered that the mere discovery of an island was sufficient to claim sovereignty over it, and often a formal act of possession was considered the proper procedure to claim rights over a territory. Ultimately, the United States did not assert its sovereignty over most of its claimed territories.|$|E
