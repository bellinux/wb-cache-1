50|$|The most {{remarkable}} change in 1994 is {{the invention of}} a direct complaint system and abolition of the referral system. Citizen can therefore direct file complaint to the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman handles the complaints from its receival to conclusion, which is more independent and autonomous. However is an expansion of power but it magnifies the undersupply of resources of the Ombudsman in the pre-transition period. The number of complaints has dramatically rise. The workload of the Office has increased 17 fold comparing to 1989 but the size of establishment has only been tripled. The small office of 90-staff against 62 department with approximately 180,000 public servants are regarded as burdensome.

40|$|Numerical field {{expressions}} {{are proposed}} {{to evaluate the}} electromagnetic fields due to the lightning channel with variable values of return stroke velocity.

Moreover, a sample of the measured lightning current is used to validate the proposed method while the velocity profile is simulated by the general velocity function. The simulated fields based on constant and variable values of velocity are compared to the <b>corresponding</b> <b>measured</b> fields.
