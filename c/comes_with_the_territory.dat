40|$|For {{coaches of}} young {{sporting}} teams, interacting with parents <b>comes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory.</b> The behaviour of parents at youth sporting events has received increased media scrutiny {{in the past}} few years. Such reports often focus on the disruptive and sometimes abusive behaviours of the sidelined parent watching their child’s sporting event. However, this game-day scenario can be influenced by the dynamic of the coach–parent relationship. Specifically, this dynamic is positively affected by open communication between parties as they work together {{in the best interests of}} the child. While the term ‘youth sport coach ’ does not automatically seem to imply that coaches have an additional role ‘coaching ’ the parents, the involvement of mums and dads is important. Most parents provide positive support for their kids, whether it is in terms of transport to and from training and games, or words of support and encouragement. These parents are an asset and should be treated as such. Unfortunately, parents ’ involvement in their children’s sporting endeavours can take forms other than unqualified support. The coach is in a powerful position to influence parents and their behaviours. Indeed, the nature of these interactions can have a great impact on the coaching environment and subsequently the experiences of the participants.

Together they represent some of the core goals for the Indian American characters, and attaining these goals epitomizes success in America. However, my exploration of these three spheres also highlights that success can be difficult to achieve, and that happiness may be even more elusive than success...|$|R

While {{training}} for a triathlon, 6 -hour bike rides <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory.</b> As a result, protein-based drinks are a must to keep nourished. Currently, {{the only way to}} keep a drink from spoiling is to have an insulated bottle. However, this does not actively keep the drink cool; it simply slows the rate of warming. This experiment was designed to create a drink holder that would use CO 2 to actively cool a drink to maintain a desired temperature. To do this, coiled copper tubing was inserted into an insulated housing with a CO 2 source attached to the other end. Between the combination of the insulated housing and CO 2 bursts, {{the rate at which the}} drink warms is slowed and even reversed when CO 2 is used. We hypothesized the concept that CO 2 would actively cool the drink inside the bottle, and experimentation proved this to be accurate. Once proof of concept was established, the next step was to optimize when and how much CO 2 was needed to maintain the desired temperature inside the bottle. Ultimately, smaller double bursts were found to be the most effective way of maintaining the temperature of the drink. Depending on the size of the CO 2 bottle used, drinks are able to maintain proper temperatures up to 3 - 4 times longer than by insulation alone. This is significant because it shows the concept doesn't just work, but it makes a considerable difference from merely insulating the bottle. This experiment provided positive results, allowing future work to be focused on the ergonomics and practicality of the final design. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|R

40|$|Although {{missing data}} are {{often viewed as}} a {{challenge}} for applied researchers, in fact missing data can be highly beneficial. Specifically, when the amount of missing data on specific variables is carefully controlled, a balance can be struck between statistical power and research costs. This article presents the issue of planned missing data by discussing specific designs (i. e., multiform designs, longitudinal wave-missing designs, and 2 -method measurement designs), introducing the power and cost benefits of such scenarios to applied education and educational psychology researchers. Within educational and psychological research, missing data seem to <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory.</b> <b>The</b> study of learning within school settings, for example, a common focus of educational psychology research, might involve tightly designed randomized controlled trials to compare programs to facilitate learning. Also common are longitudinal investigations (possibly even within randomized controlled trials), designed to gauge whether, at what rate, {{and under what circumstances}} learning is occurring. In addition to their inferential threats arising from cohort/classroom effects and changes in context over time (e. g., students transitioning to new classrooms and/or to new school settings, such as from elementary to middle school), longitudinal designs present the very practical challenges that following individuals over time is costly and typically results in missing data. These missing data could arise for fairly simple reasons, such as school absences, but are more often part of a pattern of attrition resulting from families moving or perhaps from individual students requiring alternative educational settings more tailored to their specific learning needs. Suffice it to say, dealing with missing data, whether in cross-sectional or longitudinal designs, is a very real part of the research process, as can be the dread of having to do so. Fortunately, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advent of modern missing data handling methods, and the implementation of these modern methods in most statistical software, missing data are becoming far less troublesome. In particular, so long as the missingness patterns in data are not related to the missing values themselves, analyses can proceed without much trouble or fear of bias. In addition, although some patterns of missing data can result in dramatically reduced power, other patterns can largely avoid it. For example, if two variables are highly correlated, such as perceptions of academic efficacy and academic self-worth, and one is missing many observations, not much power will be lost for testing parameters associated with that variable; in contrast, if <b>the</b> variable <b>with</b> a high rate of missing data (e. g., teacher stress) is unrelated to other variables (e. g., peer norms for cooperation), much more power will be lost for testing its parameters (e. g., means, variances, regression slopes). Planned missing data designs take advantage of these facts and impose random missingness {{in such a way that}} it does not introduce bias and it minimizes power loss. The result can be a dramatic reduction in cost, and even an increase in validity due to reducing participant burden. In this article, after a brief review of some foundations related to missing data, we present three planned missing data designs and how they could be implemented in educational research. The first type of design (multiform design) is presented in the greatest detail, laying the groundwork for the remaining two: accelerated longitudinal designs and two-method measurement designs...|$|R
