40|$|Polygonal systems {{formed by}} thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracking</b> are complex {{landscape}} features widespread in terrestrial periglacial regions. The {{manner in which}} cracking occurs is controlled by various environmental factors and determines dimension, shape, and orientation of polygons. Analogous small-scale features are ubiquitous in Martian mid- and high-latitudes, and they are also inferred to originate from thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracking.</b> We studied the geomorphometry of polygonally-patterned ground on Svalbard to draw a terrestrial analogy to small-scale polygonal structures in scalloped terrain in Martian mid-latitudes. We performed a comparative quantitative terrain analysis based on high-resolution stereo remote-sensing data (HRSC-AX and HiRISE) in combination with terrestrial field data and multivariate statistics to determine the relationship of polygon geomorphometry to local environmental conditions. Results show that polygonal structures on Svalbard and in Utopia Planitia on Mars are similar {{with respect to their}} size and shape. A comparable thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracking</b> genesis is likely. Polygon evolution, however, is strongly related to regional and local landscape dynamics. Individual polygon dimensions and orthogonality vary according to age, thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracking</b> activity, and local subsurface conditions. Based on these findings, the effects of specific past and current environmental conditions on polygon formation on Mars must be considered. On both Earth and Mars, the smallest polygons represent young, recently-active low-centered polygons that formed in fine-grained ice-rich material. Small, low-centered Martian polygons show the closest analogy to terrestrial low-centered ice-wedge polygons. The formation of composite wedges could have occurred as a result of local geomorphological conditions during past Martian orbital configurations. Larger polygons reflect past climate conditions on both Earth and Mars. The present degradation of these polygons depends on relief and topographical situation. On Svalbard the thawing of ice wedges degrades high-centered polygons; in contrast, the present appearance of polygons in Utopia Planitia is primarily the result of contemporary dry degradation processes...|$|R

They are found in consolidated terrains and grouped in localized networks. They are present at all latitudes (from North to South) and longitudes (head, neck, and body), sometimes on pit walls or following lineaments. About 1. 5 % of the observed surface is covered by polygons. Polygons have an homogeneous size across the nucleus, with 90 % of them in the size range 1 - 5 m and a mean size of 3. 0 [U+ 202 F]±[U+ 202 F] 1. 4 m. They show different morphologies, depending on the width and depth of their trough. They are found in networks with 3 - or 4 -crack intersection nodes. The polygons observed on 67 P are consistent with thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>crack</b> polygons formed by the diurnal or seasonal temperature variations in a hard (MPa) and consolidated sintered layer of water ice, located a few centimeters below the surface. Our thermal analysis shows an evolution of thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>crack</b> polygons according to the local thermal environment, with more evolved polygons (i. e. deeper and larger troughs) where the temperature and the diurnal and seasonal temperature range are the highest. Thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>crack</b> polygons are young surface morphologies that probably formed after the injection of 67 P in the inner solar system, typically 100, 000 years ago, and could be as young as a few orbital periods, following the decreasing of its perihelion distance in 1959 from 2. 7 to 1. 3 a. u.

The benches have thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> (in bedrock) on shallower, upper sections of the risers as well as salt encrusted runnels on the steeper lower section of the tread. The benches also show a distinct orientational preference (orientated to the north through to west) and, from first principles, these {{seem to be the}} aspects with optimal freeze-thaw cycles and temperatures conducive to thermal stress fatigue. The extensive dilatation associated with the retreating glaciers is thought to {{play a significant role in}} the origin and development of the benches as the combination of extensive jointing and optimal process conditions are thought to constrain where benches begin. The jointing, aided by the thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracking,</b> then facilitates extension and continued weathering of the treads. It would appear that these benches are examples of so called “cryoplanation terraces” that have been reported as fossil forms in Europe and North America.

The latitude-dependence and the morphologic similarity to terrestrial patterned ground in permafrost regions may indicate a formation as thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks,</b> but the exact formation mechanisms are still unclear. In particular, it is debated whether freeze-thaw processes and liquid water are required to generate the observed features. This study quantitatively investigates polygonal networks in ice-free parts of continental Antarctica to help distinguishing between different hypotheses of their origin on Mars. The study site {{is located in the}} Helliwell Hills in Northern Victoria Land (� 71. 73 �S/ 161. 38 �E) and was visited in the framework of the GANOVEX XI expedition during the austral summer of 2015 / 2016. The local bedrock consists mostly of sediments (sandstones) of the Beacon Supergroup and mafic igneous intrusions (Ferrar Dolerites). The surfaces are covered by glacial drift consisting of clasts with diverse lithologies. Thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> are ubiquitous. We mapped polygons {{in the northern part of}} Helliwell Hills in a GIS environment on the basis of high-resolution satellite images with a pixel size of � 50 cm. The measured spatial parameters include polygon area, perimeter, length, width, circularity and aspect. We also analyzed the connectivity of enclosed polygons within a polygon network. The polygons do not display significant local relief, but overall the polygon centers are slightly higher than the bounding cracks (i. e. high-center polygons). Sizes of polygons can vary widely, dependent on the geographical location, between 10 m 2 and > 900 m 2. In planar and level areas, thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> tend to be well connected as hexagonal or irregular polygonal networks without a preferred alignment. In contrast, polygonal networks on slopes form elongated, orthogonal primary cracks, which are either parallel or transverse to the steepest topographic gradient. During fieldwork, excavations were made in the center of polygons and across the bounding cracks. Typically, the uppermost � 40 cm of regolith are dry and unconsolidated. Below that, there is commonly a sharp transition to ice-cemented material or very clear ice with no bubbles. Soil profiles were recorded, and sediment samples were taken and analyzed for their grain size composition with laser diffractometric measurement methods.

40|$|We {{describe}} the morphology and spatial relationships between composite-wedge polygons and Mars-like gullies (consisting of alcoves, channels, and fans) in the hyper-arid Antarctic Dry Valleys (ADV), {{as a basis}} for understanding possible origins for martian gullies that also occur in association with polygonally patterned ground. Gullies in the ADV arise in part from the melting of atmospherically-derived, wind-blown snow trapped in polygon troughs. Snowmelt that yields surface flow can occur during peak southern hemisphere summer daytime insolation conditions. Ice-cemented permafrost provides an impermeable substrate over which meltwater flows, but does not significantly contribute to meltwater generation. Relationships between <b>contraction</b> <b>crack</b> polygons and sedimentary fans at the distal ends of gullies show deposition of fan material in polygon troughs, and dissection of fans by expanding polygon troughs. These observations suggest the continuous presence of meters-thick ice-cemented permafrost beneath ADV gullies. We document strong morphological similarities between gullies and polygons on Mars and those observed in the ADV Inland Mixed microclimate zone. On the basis of this morphological comparison, we propose an analogous, top–down melting model for the initiation and evolution of martian gullies that occur on polygonally-patterned, mantled surfaces...|$|E

The activity of some of these Antarctic PPG areas has come into question with the proposal that they {{may be the result of}} sublimation processes rather than actively re-working freeze and thaw processes. Near surface geophysical methods of ground penetrating radar (GPR), resistivity tomography and electromagnetism have been applied to four Antarctic Dry Valleys polygonal patterned ground (PPG) areas; two in Victoria Valley and two in Beacon Valley. The aim was to resolve subsurface structure and activity of the PPG without disturbing the delicate permafrost soils. Multiple techniques were used so that there could be greater reliability on the interpretations of this data without the need for damaging subsurface geological calibration of the geophysics by obtaining direct subsurface data through methods such as trenching or drilling. Subsurface structure of the PPG was resolved; active layer depth, deformation of permafrost in the vicinity of contraction cracks and zones of attenuation were identified. Significant deformation in the subsurface horizons of the permafrost and associated with thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>crack</b> wedge growth was identified over PPG suggested to be formed only by sublimation in Beacon Valley, thus calling into question this interpretation of the PPG activity.

40|$|Miocene {{submarine}} basanite pillows, lava lobes, megapillows and sheet lavas in the Stanley Peninsula, northwestern Tasmania, Australia, are well-preserved {{in three}} dimensions. The pillows have ropy wrinkles, transverse wrinkles, symmetrical wrinkles, <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> and {{three types of}} spreading cracks on their surfaces, and concentric and radial joints in the interior. The lava lobes have ropy wrinkles and <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> on their surfaces. The megapillows are cylindrical with a smoothly curved upper surface and steep sides, and are characterized by distinct radial columnar joints in the interior. They are connected to pillows that propagate radially from its basal margin. The sheet lavas are tabular and have vertical columnar joints in the interior. The largest sheet lava shows a remarkable gradation from a lower 5 -m-thick pillow facies to an upper massive facies. The pillows, lava lobes, megapillows and sheet lavas are inferred to have been emplaced completely below sea level but in a shallow marine environment. Their morphological features suggest that the pillows grew by episodic rupture of a near-solid crust and emergence of hot lava, whereas the lava lobes propagated by continuous stretching of the outer skin at the flow front. The megapillows and sheet lavas were master feeder channels by which molten lava was conveyed to the advancing pillows. The sheet lavas propagated by repeated processes of pillow formation and overriding by an upper massive part. Alternating pillow and massive facies commonly found in ocean-floor drill cores and exposed in cross-section in many subaqueous volcanic successions may have formed by propagation of pillows from the basal margins of advancing sheet lavas...|$|R
50|$|The thermal {{contraction}} theory states {{that during the}} winter months, thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> form only a few cm wide {{and a couple of}} metres deep because of the extreme cold weather. Over the next few months, the snow melts and the remaining water fills the cracks and the permafrost below the surface freezes it. These tiny cracks turn into permafrost. Once the summer months arrive, the permafrost expands; horizontal compression produces upturning of the frozen sediment by plastic deformation. The next winter the cold refreezes and cracks the already forming ice wedge, opening a way for the melting snow of spring to fill the empty crack. The mean annual air temperature thought needed to form ice wedges is −6° to −8°C or colder.|$|R

40|$|We {{simulate}} the stresses induced by temperature {{changes in a}} putative hard layer near the surface of comet 67 P/Churyumov [...] Gerasimenko with a thermo-viscoelastic model. Such a layer could be formed by the recondensation or sintering of water ice (and dust grains), as suggested by laboratory experiments and computer simulations, and would explain the high compressive strength encountered by experiments on board the Philae lander. Changes in temperature from seasonal insolation variation penetrate into the comet's surface to depths controlled by the thermal inertia, causing the material to expand and contract. Modelling this with a Maxwellian viscoelastic response on a spherical nucleus, we show that a hard, icy layer with similar properties to Martian permafrost will experience high stresses: up to tens of MPa, which exceed its material strength (a few MPa), down to depths of centimetres to a metre. The stress distribution with latitude is confirmed qualitatively when {{taking into account the}} comet's complex shape but neglecting thermal inertia. Stress is found to be comparable to the material strength everywhere for sufficient thermal inertia (≳ 50 J m^- 2 K^- 1 s^- 1 / 2) and ice content (≳ 45 % at the equator). In this case, stresses penetrate to a typical depth of ∼ 0. 25 m, consistent with the detection of metre-scale thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>crack</b> polygons all over the comet. Thermal fracturing may be an important erosion process on cometary surfaces which breaks down material and weakens cliffs. Comment: 11 pages, 11 figures. Accepted for publication in A&...|$|E
40|$|The Messinian Realmonte salt deposit {{consists}} of a 400 – 600 m-thick halite succession that {{can be divided into}} four main lithologicunits (base to top) : A) cumulates of plates settled out from astratified water column; B) plate cumulates in a shallowing-upwardsequence containing six kainite layers {{near the top of the}} unit; C) cumulatesof skeletal hoppers with chevron overgrowths precipitatedfrom a nonstratified water body; and D) skeletal halite and anhydrite. Spectacular vertical fissures cut through the upper part of unit B atits boundary with salt unit C. These fissures are spaced at intervals ofup to 5 m apart, extend down to a depth of 6 m, and are filled by redmud. The salt beds affected by the fissures are commonly upturned(buckled) and are truncated and onlapped by the succeeding flat-lyinghalite beds of unit C. Additionally, the upturned layers are cut byvertical dissolution pipes that extend down to as much as a depth of 4 m below the fissured surface. To explain the observed superimposed structures we propose twomechanisms, both induced by the desiccation of the evaporite basin:(1) When the salt surface was exposed, the halite layers were buckled,broke into polygonal crusts, and formed tepee structures. Thebuckling was caused by a net volume increase due to thermal expansion,and what is more important, precipitation of new halite inducedby evaporative pumping of brines moving up from the groundwatertable. The buckled salt layers were then affected by meteoric dissolution,which created vertical pipes. (2) The tepee structures and the associated zone of dissolution pipesare further crosscut by a new network of large polygons. These newpolygonal sets are outlined by deep fissures in which red silt collected,blown by the wind or carried by episodes of surface flooding. This typeof deep <b>contraction</b> <b>crack</b> is known to be produced by volumetricchanges induced by annual temperature fluctuations. The documentation of contraction polygons and other exposure featuresrepresents the first report of desiccation events during the depositionof the Sicilian salt.

40|$|Polygonal {{networks}} of patterned ground {{are a common}} feature in cold-climate environments. They can form through the thermal contraction of ice-cemented sediment (i. e. formed from fractures), or the freezing and thawing of ground ice (i. e. formed by patterns of clasts, or ground deformation). The characteristics of these landforms provide information about environmental conditions. Analogous polygonal forms have been observed on Mars leading to inferences about environmental conditions. We have identified clastic polygonal features located around Lyot crater, Mars (50 °N, 30 °E). These polygons are unusually large (> 100 m diameter) compared to terrestrial clastic polygons, and contain very large clasts, {{some of which are}} up to 15 metres in diameter. The polygons are distributed in a wide arc around the eastern side of Lyot crater, at a consistent distance from the crater rim. Using high-resolution imaging data, we digitised these features to extract morphological information. These data are compared to existing terrestrial and Martian polygon data to look for similarities and differences and to inform hypotheses concerning possible formation mechanisms. Our results show the clastic polygons do not have any morphometric features that indicate they are similar to terrestrial sorted, clastic polygons formed by freeze-thaw processes. They are too large, do not show the expected variation in form with slope, and have clasts that do not scale in size with polygon diameter. However, the clastic networks are similar in network morphology to thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks,</b> and there is a potential direct Martian analogue in a sub-type of thermal contraction polygons located in Utopia Planitia. Based upon our observations, we reject the hypothesis that polygons located around Lyot formed as freeze-thaw polygons and instead an alternative mechanism is put forward: they result from the infilling of earlier thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> by wind-blown material, which then became compressed and/or cemented resulting in a resistant fill. Erosion then leads to preservation of these polygons in positive relief, while later weathering results in the fracturing of the fill material to form angular clasts. These results suggest that there was an extensive area of ice-rich terrain, the extent of which is linked to ejecta from Lyot crater...|$|R

40|$|Southwest Hokkaido is {{situated}} in {{the extension of the}} inner belt of the North Honshu Arc and is dominated by the Neogene to Quaternary volcanic rocks. The Early Miocene volcanic rocks are mostly subaerial products, whereas the subsequent Neogene volcanic rocks are mainly submarine andesitic products diagnostic of island arcs. They are divided into lavas and volcaniclastic rocks. The lavas are subdivided into pillow lobes, lava lobes, sheet flows and pseudo-pillow lavas. The volcaniclastic rocks are classified into hyaloclastites, pyroclastic rocks and epiclastic volcanic rocks. Particularly, the hyaloclastites occupy the large proportion of the Neogene volcanic rocks in Southwest Hokkaido. The pillow lobes are cylinder or tubular and mostly andesitic. Their surface structures are recognized as ropy wrinkles, spreading cracks, tensional <b>cracks</b> and <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks.</b> The former three are formed during the growth of the pillow lobes, whereas the latter two are made after the emplacement. The ropy wrinkles are analogous to those on a subaerial pahoehoe lava. The corrugations are formed by internal convection or scratching. The spreading cracks are formed across or along the elongation of the pillow lobes, and play the most important role in their growth. The tensional cracks are produced by further supply of the interior magma even after stopping of the growth of the pillow lobes. The <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> are formed by gradual cooling of the pillow lobes. The internal structure of the pillow lobe is characterized by joints, crusts and vesicles. The joints correspond to the <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> and are radial, irregular and tortoise-shell in shape. The crusts are produced by shear jointing during the growth of the pillow lobes. The vesicles are ellipsoidal to spherical. The inner vesicles are larger than the outer ones. Pipe vesicles develop in places along the boder zone of the pillow lobes. Microscopic features of the andesitic pillow lobes are intersertal or intergranular texture in the inner part, and quench crystal overgrowth on the phenocrysts or microphenocryst in the outer part. The lava lobes are chracteristic of andesitic or rhyolitic subaqueous lavas. They are ellipsoidal a few meters across and are composed of crystalline cores and glassy margins grading outward into hyaloclastites. The cores are characterized by flow layers conformable to the outlines, and radial rude joints. Sheet flows and small lava lobes develop from the glassy margins. The lave lobes are formed by expansion of the sheet flows due to further supply of the internal magma. The pseudo-pillow lavas are one of andesitic subaqueous forms. They consist of polyhedral blocks of tens centimeters to a few meters across. They are formed by development of quench joints. The hyaloclastites are divided into (A) and (B) types. The (A) type is basaltic to andesitic monolithologic breccia and usually includes pillows (ellipsoids with quench glass). These pillows are formed by disintegration of pillow lobes or apophysis-like feeder dyke. Particularly, those concentrated at the margins of the apophysis-like feeder dykes are called concentric pillows. The (B) type is andesitic to rhyolitic monolithologic breccia. It is a product formed by brittle fracturing of the pseudo-pillow lava, lava lobe, massive feeder dyke, caused by quenching with water. Massive hyaloclastites are accumulated around the lavas and feeder dykes, and grade laterally into stratified hyaloclastites which are foreset-beds showing a primary dipping of 20 °- 30 °, in places overlain by topset-beds. Each foreset-bed displays reverse or reverse-to-normal grading, suggesting that it was formed by a debris flow. The Neogene subaqueous lavas and hyaloclastites in Southwest Hokkaido are highly vesicular and in places associated with subaqueous pyroclastic rocks, such as scoriaceous agglomerates and pyroclastic pillow breccias, suggesting that they are the products of shallow submarine volcanism...|$|R

40|$|East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). The {{surficial}} {{material on}} the floor of Beacon Valley is segmented into large polygonal landforms separated by trenches. Buried beneath the polygons and surficial material is massive ground ice. One hypothesis is that the buried ice in upper Beacon Valley is glacier ice originating from local debris-covered glaciers. The networks of polygons and trenches forn ~ as the buried ice undergoes thermal contraction and sublimation. <b>Contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> that penetrate the surficial material and buried ice in Beacon Valley contain Late Miocene age volcanic ashes. The ashes post-date the buried ice. The preservation of such old ice implies a continuous extreme polar condition in Beacon Valley since late Miocene time. An alternative explanation is that the buried ice in Beacon Valley is modem ground ice that formed from percolation of melted, wind-blown snow that subsequently froze within the sediment mantle. Polygonal landforms would result from the seasonal freeze-thaw of the modem ground ice and surficial material. Continual freeze-thaw action, or cryoturbation, would create a mass of coalesced, modern ice lenses covered with older sediment. The buried ice in this case could be young, and hence could not b...|$|R
40|$|Thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracking</b> was {{monitored}} for {{two years}} in a continuous permafrost region. A dilatometer read the separation of a pair of benchmarks installed at both sides of an ice-wedge trough. The outputs were recorded in a data logger together with ground temperatures at various depths. Widening of the trough was insignificant during the warmer first winter, while several significant events occurred during the colder second winter. The amount of widening reflected the magnitude of cooling. The maximum widening in the second winter corresponded to the most severe cooling in early February, during which the frozen active layer experienced significant creep, possibly accompanied by cracking. The ground temperature data were analyzed {{on the basis of a}} viscoelastic model, which shows that horizontal tensile stress is favored by higher cooling rates and colder ground. The predicted maximum stress at the ground surface and at the permafrost table, which was reached during the maximum widening event, is of the same order of magnitude as the tensile strengths of typical frozen soils and polycrystalline ice, respectively. Consequently, the ground thermal regime during this event was capable of cracking both the frozen active layer and the ice wedge...|$|R
40|$|When cracks form {{in a thin}} {{contracting}} layer, they sequentially {{break the}} layer into smaller and smaller pieces. A rectilinear crack pattern encodes information about the order of crack formation, as later cracks tend to intersect with earlier cracks at right angles. In a hexagonal pattern, in contrast, the angles between all cracks at a vertex are near 120 ^∘. However, hexagonal crack patterns are typically only seen when a crack network opens and heals repeatedly, in a thin layer, or advances by many intermittent steps into a thick layer. Here it is shown how both types of pattern can arise from identical forces, and how a rectilinear crack pattern evolves towards a hexagonal one. Such an evolution is expected when cracks undergo many opening cycles, where the cracks in any cycle are guided by the positions of cracks in the previous cycle, but when they can slightly vary their position, and order of opening. The general features of this evolution are outlined, and compared to {{a review of the}} specific patterns of <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> in dried mud, polygonal terrain, columnar joints, and eroding gypsum-sand cementsComment: 19 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in Phil.

40|$|La Villa is an unshocked H 4 chondriate. Chemical {{compositions}} require crystallization {{at temperatures}} > 1250 °C for enstatite and > 1211 °C for augite. Widespread (100) polysynthetic twins and (001) <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> in enstatite indicate crystallization as protoenstatite, inverted to either ortho- or clinoenstatite or both on cooling. High-resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} shows a range of orthoclinoenstatite intergrowths: heavily faulted clinoenstatite in radial and poikilitic chondrules, almost regular orthoenstatite in a microgranular chondrule and in the matrix. In the former, the clinoenstatite lamellae are both even or odd multiples of the 9 A periodicity, a few unit cells thick, twinned and interleaved with minor orthoenstatite. In the latter, orthoenstatite lamellae are regularly stacked for more than 2000 A. Localized annealing effects, reversing clinoenstatite to orthoenstatite, are revealed by 'U-shaped' and 'Z-shaped' terminations. The variable microstructure suggest different cooling rates for the different chondrule types, soon after the liquidus-to-solidus transition (1200 to 1300 °C) but prior to accretion. In particular, clinoenstatite-rich crystals from radial and poikilitic chondrules give cooling rates {{on the order of}} 100 and 10 °C/h. Comparisons with previous works on dynamic crystallization experiments and orthopyroxene Fe-Mg cation ordering indicate a nonlinear cooling path from the high chondrule formation temperatures to a postaccretionary low-temperature (340 - 480 °C) evolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{confirmation}} of near-surface ground ice and perchlorates at the Phoenix landing site suggest that high-latitude ground-ice thaw {{may be more}} easily achieved than previously envisaged, providing the potential to drive significant, distinctive morphogenesis. We describe {{the results of a}} survey of 23 High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) images covering 337 ° of longitude between latitudes 59 °N and 79 °N in which such morphogenesis is apparent, confirming that thaw has been a regionally important morphological agent. Some of the strongest geomorphological indicators of cyclical ground-ice thaw described are assemblages of sorted landforms, including clastic patterned ground resulting from cryoturbation of ice-rich regolith and lobate forms reflecting solifluction. Also described are braided gully-fan systems sourced at thermokarst pits and channels that have evolved from enlarged thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks.</b> Not only are these landforms indicative of thaw and flowing liquid but the incision of solifluction lobes by thermokarst gullies demonstrates that thaw has been responsible for polycyclic morphogenesis. The presence of these landforms across the high northern latitudes of Mars indicates that the regional importance of thaw has been underestimated. This in turn has important implications for the development of better climate models and the search for life on Mars. ...|$|R
40|$|Sedimentary {{structures}} {{formed by}} the progressive primary infilling of thermal <b>contraction</b> <b>cracks</b> with sand are termed primary sand veins and sand wedges. In addition to simple vein- or wedge-shapes irregularities {{can be caused by}} sand veins branching from their sides and toes. Primary sand wedges form widely in sandy polar deserts, locally in sandy areas of tundra and probably in seasonally frozen ground. There are no unique criteria for distinguishing primary sand veins and wedges from sand veins and wedges of other origins. Identification of the former depends on the occurrence of distinctive features not always present and on evaluation of their lithofacies and palaeoenvironmental contexts. Care and caution are advocated in the use of ancient/relict primary sand veins and wedges as quantitative palaeoenvironmental indicators because modern active wedge distribution is poorly known and hence inferred thermal climatic threshold values are questionable. It is suggested that ancient/relict primary sand wedges exceeding 2 m in depth and with well-developed vertical lamination probably indicate the former occurrence of continuous permafrost, whereas sand veins and narrow sand wedges (frost cracks) are potentially ambiguous as they may form not only in the active layer above and within continuous permafrost but also in seasonally frozen ground in non-permafrost areas...|$|R
