5|$|A Master Plan {{adopted in}} 2000 {{called for the}} port to be {{transformed}} into a container port, which led to the purchase of the largest harbor crane in the state. In 2002, the Port District Commission took the lead in the development of Albany's Riverfront Park in the Corning Preserve as part of a development to enhance Albany's access to the river. The port helped in financing the project and in the construction of two bulkheads which have seasonal floating docks attached. In a 2005 audit, the Office of the State Comptroller questioned the port's involvement in the construction and financing. Two issues raised were the port district's lack of authority to build docks for non-commercial use and that the port would receive no income for facilities it was financing. The port received $3.3million in 2002 to upgrade and {{become a member of the}} Inland Distribution Network, a select group of ports that are used as satellite locations for the distribution of <b>container</b> <b>cargo</b> from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, resulting in less congestion at downstate ports and highways.|$|E

40|$|The {{maritime}} logistics {{associated with}} the international trade of <b>container</b> <b>cargoes</b> {{are concerned with the}} flows of cargo, information, finance, and images among stakeholders. The stakeholders include shippers, consignees, freight forwarders, third-party logistics providers (3 PL), land and sea carriers, ports, and government agents and customs officers. 1 The seamless, smooth flow of <b>container</b> <b>cargoes</b> and related information among the stakeholders contributes to reduced logistics costs and, consequently, to the improved competitiveness and productivity of each stakeholder and increased competitiveness in international trade. In this regard, we propose three innovative concepts of economies in maritime logistics - namely, the economies of flow, economies of connection, and economies of fusion technology. 2 Numerous stakeholders share the cargo information on the origin and destination of internationally sea-transported <b>container</b> <b>cargoes,</b> which relates to economies of flow and economies of connection. Information technologies (ITs) such as radiofrequency identification (RFID), global positioning systems (GPS), cargo tracking systems, and electronic data interchanges (EDIs) (Lee et al., 2000) have been applied to maritime logistics. Moreover, the single window system (SWS) collaboratively operated by the private and public sectors in Singapore and Korea has contributed to accelerating the flow of <b>container</b> <b>cargoes</b> and the sharing of the container information among the stakeholders...|$|R

25|$|An {{intermodal}} container {{is a large}} standardized shipping container, designed and built for intermodal freight transport, meaning these containers can be used across different modes of transport – from ship to rail to truck – without unloading and reloading their cargo.

These containers are known under a number of names, such as simply <b>container,</b> <b>cargo</b> or freight container, ISO container, shipping, sea or ocean container, container van or (Conex) box, sea or c can.|$|E

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{importance}} of logistic {{in a green}} and environmental friendly way, it is widely accepted that short sea shipping (SSS) is a mean to divert the freight traffic from congested corridor in local communities {{as well as to}} reduce environmental costs. It can also relieve the problem of traffic congestion and investment on road construction and maintenance. This paper considers a multimodal transportation model for domestic <b>container</b> <b>cargos,</b> in which the flow of <b>container</b> <b>cargos</b> moving between foreign seaports and domestic cities can be transported via domestic seaports using SSS and inland by truck. We propose a two-level strategy in evaluating the various government policies to encourage or regulate the usage of SSS. While the objective of the freight carriers is to minimize its transportation cost, the government could internalize the external cost and invest on the transportation network with considering the cost to the society. A case study with the Taiwan network is performed to illustrate the benefit and performance of the model. postprintThe 12 th World Conference on Transport Research (WCTR), Lisbon, Portugal, 11 - 15 July 2010...|$|R

2500|$|Freight {{trains in}} China are {{primarily}} used to ship bulk cargo. The important cargo is coal, {{which accounts for}} more than half of total rail freight tonnage. [...] In 2013, 2.322 billion tons of coal were shipped on trains in China, about 58% of the total rail freight tonnage of 3.967 billion. [...] Another one-fifth of rail freight was devoted to ores and minerals, which were 851 million tons (21.5%) in 2013. [...] Other major categories of bulk goods include grain (110 million tons, 2.77% in 2013) and fertilizer (87 million tons, 2.19% in 2013). <b>Container</b> <b>cargo</b> constitutes a small fraction of the total freight, about 88 million tons or 2.21% in 2013.

[...] In China, that number is only 8% as of 2016 and 77% for highways out of 43 billion tons, but that number is expected to increase due to new environmental regulations in regards to air pollution, which is expected to force millions of trucks off roadways.|$|E
