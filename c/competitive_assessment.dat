40|$|Abstract—In today’s quickly {{changing}} and increasingly competitive market place, {{it is imperative}} that manufacturers keep abreast of the technological advances and design innovations incorporated into competing product lines. The term <b>competitive</b> <b>assessment</b> (or benchmarking) has been coined by manufacturers to describe the process of ethically acquiring, inspecting, analyzing, instrumenting, and testing the product lines of other manufacturers. The <b>Competitive</b> <b>Assessment</b> Laboratory at Rowan University is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). In the laboratory, multidisciplinary teams of freshman engineering students from each of the four engineering departments perform each of the above tasks on a consumer product. The laboratory contains a series of consumer appliance test stations featuring PC-based data acquisition systems capable of measuring thermocouple and voltage/current signals. Each station is also equipped with mechanical measurement equipment and portable materials testing equipment. In addition to introducing students to the science and art of design, the <b>Competitive</b> <b>Assessment</b> Laboratory enables the faculty to assess the constantly evolving initial conditions under which the typical engineering student enters his or her course of study.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} an ex-post {{assessment}} of two horizontal mergers {{motivated by the}} dearth in post-merger analyses in the South African context. The objective is to examine whether market dynamics have changed as stated by the Competition Tribunal. The main theories tested are whether the merged firm post-merger was able to exert market power unilaterally or in coordinated manner. These constructs are examined against the ability of customers to restrain market power, barriers to entry, {{the effect of the}} remedies imposed and the financial performance. The results reveal that the Tribunal leans towards the SCP doctrine and demonstrates the need for a dynamic approach in <b>competitive</b> <b>assessments</b> informed by understanding how competitors and customers may react to a merger. The research findings indicate that the Tribunal’s conclusions on both the Nampak/Burcap and Scaw/Ozz transactions were unproven, post-merger.

40|$|The FCC 2 ̆ 7 s 14 th and 15 th Annual Wireless Competition reports {{review a}} wide variety of evidence, both direct (how firms and {{customers}} behave) and indirect (industry concentration measures) in making its <b>competitive</b> <b>assessment.</b> The reports are silent on how to interpret this evidence. In contrast, modem antitrust analysis relies far more on direct evidence. In failing to put more weight on the relevant direct market evidence to reach an informed <b>competitive</b> <b>assessment,</b> the 14 th and 15 th reports invite erroneous conclusions about the state of competition in wireless markets. The authors are concerned that these erroneous conclusions eventually could adversely influence regulatory policy in wireless markets. Before economists came to rely on direct measures of market power, they relied on indirect measures, such as market share in the relevant markets, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (2 ̆ 2 HHI 2 ̆ 2), and market definitions. The 14 th and 15 th reports downplayed direct evidence of competition-namely, aggressive pricing behavior, robust entry, and continued long-term reductions in price, all of which strongly support a conclusion of 2 ̆ 2 effective competition. 2 ̆ 2 Instead, the FCC focuses on inferences of market power based on market shares. To test the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s presumed relationship between market structure and prices in the wireless industry, the authors analyzed the TNS Telecoms database of cellular telephone bills. The authors found no statistically significant relationship between a household 2 ̆ 7 s monthly wireless bill and the HHI of the economic area in which the household resides. Thus, market concentration {{does not appear to have}} an impact on what the customer actually pays. This finding, along with the fact that wireless prices have declined over time as industry concentration has increased, undermines the structure-conduct hypothesis that undergirds the FCC 2 ̆ 7 s market-share analysis...|$|E
