40|$|Large {{organizations}} with sophisticated infrastructures have large form-based systems that manage {{the interaction between}} the user community and the infrastructure. In many cases, when a user needs to <b>complete</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>to</b> accomplish a task, the user e-mails a description of the task to the appropriate form expert. In many cases this description is incomplete and the expert engages in a clarification dialog to determine the details of the task. Since many tasks and descriptions are routine, this e-mail dialog can be replaced with an intelligent user interface. The interface proactively reads e-mail (or IM) messages and assists the user in completing the associated task without involving the expert. To ground our vision in a specific application, we have built an agent that functions as a webmaster assistant. For example, a user emails the request: “Change John Doe’s home phone number to 800 - 555 - 1212 ” to the agent. The webmaster agent then replies with the biographical data form displaying information about John Doe with the new phone number pre-filled in the form. The user then simply approves the change. In this paper we describe a prototype website maintenance agent that (i) allows users to express the updates they want to make in human terms (free text input expression of intent), and (ii) allows users to quickly repair any inference errors the agent makes. In addition, we present the results of a proof of concept study that details how interacting with a webmaster agent that makes inference errors is both more efficient (faster) and more effective (errors made to site) than sending a request to a human webmaster. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the application of our work to any form-based system...|$|E

We argue that, {{for certain}} {{constrained}} domains, elaborate model transformation technologies—implemented from scratch in generalpurpose programming languages—are unnecessary for model-driven engineering; instead, lightweight configuration of commercial off-the-shelf productivity tools suffices.

40|$|It is {{recommended}} that providers advise cessation to their patients who smoke. However, patients' reports of cessation advice indicate disparities based on patients' race, gender, age, and smoking level. Providers' reports do not corroborate these disparities. We investigated whether smokers who receive their care in a community health center recalled their providers advising them to quit smoking when their providers documented such advice. We examined 219 patient-provider dyads to assess factors associated with lack of agreement between providers' documentation and patient recall. Patients were asked to recall any provider advice to quit smoking in the post 2 years. After every visit, providers <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>to</b> record {{the content of the}} visit. Most of the patients were African American, married, and uninsured. Sixty-eight percent of the dyads agreed in their documentation/recall. Patient race was the only factor associated with lack of agreement; African-American patients were more likely than white patients to provide discrepant reports. Although this study can not disentangle the racial difference in patient-provider recall/documentation, results may indicate an important area in which health disparities exist.

These juveniles were followed for 18 months to establish whether or not they committed more crimes. In addition, the parents of these children were traced in the police criminal record systems. Data were gathered from 577 children and their parents. Of these children, 34 % were exposed to parental criminality, of which 33 delinquents had two criminal parents and 163 had one criminal parent. If both parents were criminal, the child had the highest frequency of offending. Further, the frequency of parental offending was positively related to the frequency of the child's offending. Concerning the seriousness of juvenile crimes, the seriousness of the committed offences of the father showed a positive relation with the seriousness of his child's offending. Unexpectedly, a negative association was found between the seriousness of maternal offending and the seriousness of her child offending. These results offered {{a better understanding of the}} influence that parents with a criminal history have on their children.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} {{to address the issue of}} the potential harm of workaholism. It specifically examined the relationships between workaholism, self-acceptance, psychological well-being, and physical symptoms. Furthermore, participants <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> <b>form</b> <b>to</b> rate their perceptions of their parents work behaviors, and thus relationships between perceived parental workaholism, physical symptoms, psychological well-being, and self-acceptance, were also explored. Three hundred forty seven students from <b>a</b> Midwestern university <b>completed</b> <b>a</b> survey measuring the above constructs. Of these 347 surveys, 279 were utilized for analysis. It was hypothesized that students' workaholism would correlate negatively with the students' psychological well-being and self-acceptance, and positively with physical health complaints. It was expected that student workaholics would report less psychological well-being, more physical complaints, and less self-acceptance than nonworkaholic students. Furthermore it was hypothesized that there would be no relationship between perceived parental workaholism and students' workaholism. While it was hypothesized that students who perceive their parents as workaholic would report less psychological well-being and self-acceptance than students with perceived nonworkaholic parents, it was not expected that they would report more physical health complaints. Results supported the majority of the hypotheses. A negative relationship was found between students' workaholism and the students' psychological well-being and self-acceptance, while a positive relationship was found between students' workaholism and physical health complaints. Students in the medium to high risk workaholic group were found to have significantly more physical health complaints, and lower self-acceptance and psychological well-being than students scoring in the low risk workaholic group. Furthermore, students with perceptions of parental workaholism falling within the medium to high risk range, had significantly lower levels of psychological well-being and self-acceptance than parents falling within the low risk range. No differences were expected in these two groups in terms of physical health complaints, however students' with perceptions of parental workaholism in the medium to high risk range had significantly more physical symptoms than students' with lower perceptions of parental workaholism. Furthermore, while no correlation was expected between perceived parental workaholism and student workaholism, a significant positive correlation was found.

40|$|In The Netherlands, {{a system}} to control the {{prevalence}} of Salmonella in the pork supply chain is under development by the Product Boards of Livestock, Meat and Eggs. Therefore, the Animal Sciences Group-Applied Research has developed a tool to support pig-finishing farms to control Salmonella. This tool contains eight checklists.

Each checklist deals with a part of the farm procedures; supply of water, piglets, pelleted feed, cereals, roughage, liquid co-products and hygiene and daily management. By means of the developed tool, farm specific control measures to reduce the introduction and spread of Salmonella can easily be identified by the farmer. The effectiveness and practical feasibility of the checklists are determined by implementing advised measures during eight months at three finishing farms.
