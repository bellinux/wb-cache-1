40|$|An {{analytical}} {{dispersion model}} has been derived to determine the distribution <b>of</b> velocities and <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tracer</b> in <b>a</b> two-dimensional jet in a coflowing ambient fluid. The particular novelty of this model is that it bridges the gap between near-field (where initial momentum dominates behaviour) and far-field (where ambient turbulence is more important) domains. We describe this domain as the intermediate field. In <b>a</b> literature review <b>of</b> coflowing jets we find several laboratory studies and models which can predict the velocities (and in some cases concentrations) in a 2 D jet, however they all have shortcomi ngs. None could fully account for ambient turbulence, and all were strictly near-field, i. e. {{they are unable to}} describe behaviour when ambient turbulence dominates the initial shear. <b>A</b> brief review <b>of</b> analytical far-field models was also undertaken. There are standard solutions for the dispersion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 2 D continuous source but none that allow for an initial source momentum or non-uniform velocity. As opposed to the near-field coflow approach used by other researchers we start from the far-field, modifying the simple diffusion models by perturbing the governing equations to allow for the initial momentum. Models are developed for both along-stream velocity and the <b>concentration</b> field <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tracer.</b> From the velocity model, a comparison is made with experimental data available from one researcher (Wang, 1996) and an existing near-field coflow model PJCMERG (Davidson, 1989). The initial conditions (width and excess velocity) for our model are determined by Gaussian curve fitting to an arbitrary point in the near-field. The diffusivity parameter is used to adjust (tune) the model until the centreline velocity profile matches. We can always achieve this match and to a much closer degree than PJCMERG. There are no available laboratory or field data for <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tracer</b> in <b>a</b> 2 D coflowing jet although the near-field model PJCMERG does have <b>a</b> <b>tracer</b> component. We demonstrate how PJCMERG cannot converge to any far-field model, while our model provides a neat transition between the near-field and far-field. We have started the extension of the 2 D model to the more common 3 D situation although we have yet to carry out any comparisons with other models or data. The model development is included in an appendix for other researchers to pick up...|$|R

Taylor observed in the 1950 ’s that, in such a setting, the tracer diffuses at a rate proportional to 1 /ν, rather than the expected rate proportional to ν. We provide a mathematical explanation for this enhanced diffusion using a combination of Fourier analysis and center manifold theory. More precisely, we show that, while the high modes of the concentration decay exponentially, the low modes decay algebraically, but at an enhanced rate. Moreover, the behavior of the low modes is governed by finite-dimensional dynamics on an appropriate center manifold, which corresponds exactly to diffusion by a fluid with viscosity proportional to 1 /ν. ...|$|E

A transient adjusts from the initial condition of static fluid to a regime in which buoyancy and viscous forces are in balance.

Analysis of the material included mineralogy, grain size and total organic carbon. Uptake kinetics were determined for {sup 85 }Sr, {sup 99 }Tc, {sup 125 }I, {sup 137 }Cs, {sup 210 }Pb, {sup 232 }U, and {sup 241 }Am and distribution coefficients (K{sub d}) were determined for these radionuclides using batch type experiments. Sorption isotherms were developed for {sup 85 }Sr, {sup 99 }Tc, and {sup 137 }Cs to examine the effect that varying the <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>tracer</b> has on the quantity of that tracer taken up by the solid. The effect of liquid to solid ratio on the uptake of contaminants was determined for {sup 99 }Tc and {sup 137 }Cs. In another set of experiments, the sediment was separated into four size fractions and uptake was determined for each fraction for {sup 85 }Sr, {sup 99 }Tc, and {sup 137 }Cs. In addition, the sediment was analyzed to determine if it contains observable concentrations of anthropogenic radionuclides...|$|E
40|$|Leaf blowers are <b>an</b> obvious source <b>of</b> {{particulate}} matter (PM) emissions. The emission rates, however, {{have never been}} quantitatively measured {{and there is no}} default emission factor in AP- 42 for this source. A system was designed and evaluated for determining emissions from leaf blowing/vacuuming, raking and sweeping activities. The system consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large portable enclosure to trap PM emissions during these activities and used real-time PM analyzers to measure PM concentrations. Measurements were made for PM 2. 5, PM 10 and total suspended {{particulate matter}} (TSP). In this enclosure the leaf blower could be used in a normal manner while allowing the PM emissions to be confined for quantification. The horizontal and vertical distribution of the PM cloud was characterized as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> time after the blowing operation ceased in order to optimize sampling locations and times. The <b>concentration</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hydrocarbon <b>tracer</b> gas released during the blower operation was measured with a photoionization detector to determine the exchange rate. Experiments were conducted during calm wind periods to minimize the exchange rate. Emission rates were calculated from measured concentrations, enclosure dimensions, and are...|$|R
40|$|For guiding optimal {{design and}} {{interpretation}} of in-situ treatments that strongly perturb subsurface systems, knowledge about the spatial and temporal patterns of mass transport and reaction intensities are important. Here, a procedure was developed and applied to time-lapse <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conservative <b>tracer</b> (bromide), <b>an</b> injected amendment (acetate) and reactive species (iron(II), uranium(VI) and sulfate) associated with two field scale biostimulation experiments, which were conducted successively at the same field location over two years. The procedure {{is based on a}} temporal moment analysis approach that relies on a streamtube approximation. The study shows that biostimulated reactions can be considerably influenced by subsurface hydrological and geochemical heterogeneities: the delivery of bromide and acetate and the intensity of the sulfate reduction is interpreted to be predominantly driven by the hydrological heterogeneity, while the intensity of the iron reduction is interpreted to be primarily controlled by the geochemical heterogeneity. The intensity of the uranium(VI) reduction appears to be impacted by both the hydrological and geochemical heterogeneity. Finally, the study documents the existence of feedbacks between hydrological heterogeneity and remediation-induced biogeochemical transformations at the field scale, particularly the development of precipitates that may cause clogging and flow rerouting...|$|R
40|$|Within this presentation, the {{influence}} of the flow rate and scale on the transport <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-reactive saline <b>tracer</b> in <b>a</b> large undisturbed sandy subsoil monolith is stud- ied. The monolithique sample was extracted in a quarry at 10 m depth from the sur- face and equipped in the laboratory with tensiometers, temperature probes and time- domain-reflectometry probes. Eight solute breakthrough experiments were conducted at different flow rates allowing to elucidate the solute transport parameters in terms <b>of</b> <b>a</b> variable flow rate. The latter was controlled by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high precision irri- gation system in a range between 1 and 100 cm/d. Solute resident <b>concentrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> saline <b>tracer</b> was continuously monitored through 10 TDR probes of 0. 4 m length, inserted in 3 vertical transects. Time series were used to estimate apparent dispersiv- ities and velocities at different locations by inversion of the analytical solution of the convection-dispersion equation for solute resident <b>concentrations.</b> The evolution <b>of</b> the apparent dispersivity with depth is studied in order to characterize the transport pro- cesses. Horizontal heterogeneity of the effective parameters is related to a mesoscale effective dispersivity factor. Furthermore, influence of the flow rate on the estimated dispersivity is also investigated...|$|R
