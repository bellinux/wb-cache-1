40|$|The {{absence of}} {{industry}} specific regulation {{of access to}} the incumbent's telecommunications network in New Zealand for an extended period, between 1989 and 2001, is unique compared with other countries with developed telecommunications markets that were opened to competitive entry. This feature of the New Zealand market provides an opportunity to compare the conduct and performance of antitrust regulation with industry specific regulation introduced in 2001. Of particular interest is the place of the concepts of natural monopoly and perfect competition in the regulation of a dynamic market. This thesis establishes the characteristics that contribute to dynamic supply and demand conditions in the telecommunications market including network effects, discontinuity in demand due to participation, ongoing technological progress of hardware, sunk costs of software development, and the irreversible investment of augmenting capacity to meet expected growth in demand. The economic literature on conjectural variations indicates that under such conditions the concepts of natural monopoly and perfect competition do not explain <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> due to an unstable market equilibrium. The implication is that forming a reasonable view of <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> is limited to the present period of time. It is shown that decisions made under antitrust regulation are limited to the particular context of disputed <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct,</b> and these decisions do not speculate on future <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct.</b> In contrast, industry specific regulation has formed a sequence of views of <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct,</b> looking forward, that is based on concepts of natural monopoly and perfect competition. It is observed that with time, these views of <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> have evolved with the changing market conditions. If regulatory actions evolve with a changing view of <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> they risk reducing dynamic efficiency...|$|E

40|$|We extend Bresnahan and Reiss’s (1991) {{model of}} local {{oligopoly}} to allow firm entry and exit over time. In our framework, entrants have to incur sunk costs {{in order to}} enter a market. After becoming incumbents, they disregard these entry costs in deciding whether to continue operating or to exit. We apply this framework to study market structure and <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> in local markets for high-speed Internet service from 1999 to 2003. Replication of Bresnahan and Reiss’s framework generates unreasonable variation in firms ’ <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> over time. This variation disappears when entry costs are allowed. We find that once the market has one to three firms, the next entrant has little effect on <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct.</b> We also find that entry costs vary with the order of entry, especially for early entrants.

Building on models of entry in atomistically competitive markets, we show how the number of producers in an oligopolistic market varies with changes in demand and market competition. These analytical results structure our empirical analysis of competition in five retail and professional industries. Using data on geographically isolated oligopolies, we find that almost all variation in <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> occurs in monopolies and duopolies.

40|$|The Panzar-Rosse {{test has}} been widely applied to assess <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct,</b> often in specifcations {{controlling}} for firm scale or using a price equation.

Our theoretical findings are confirmed by an empirical analysis of competition in banking, using a sample covering more than 110, 000 bank-year observations on almost 18, 000 banks in 67 countries during 1986 - 2004.

40|$|Both {{advocates of}} {{competition}} {{as a means}} to better school performance and economics-based research on this issue assume a direct relationship between a more competitive market structure (in terms of the number and concentration of schools in a local market) and better school performance. This is an application to schools of the structure-conduct-performance model. It is assumed that head teachers and other professionals are motivated solely by self-interest, so that lack of competition results in x-inefficiency. However, if educational professionals are motivated by other considerations, in particular their values and beliefs, there is no automatic link between competitive structure and forms of <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> that lead to better school performance. Since it is <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> that affects school performance, the hypothesis of a postitive relationship between competition and performance is investigated in this study by collecting and analysing data on perceptions of <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> from a survey of headteachers. An analysis of these data combined with administrative data finds that: the two measures of perceived competition are only weakly related to measures of structural competition; the number of perceived competitors is positively and significantly related to school performance in terms of the percentage of students obtaining 5 or more grades A* to C at GCSE but not the percentage obtaining 5 + A*-G grades. ...|$|E

40|$|While {{there is}} broad {{agreement}} among competition lawyers and economists that a monopolist {{should be free}} to compete and defend its position against would-be competitors, there is disagreement about how to distinguish between monopolistic practices and legitimate <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> by firms with substantial market power. This article argues that in characterising conduct either as a taking advantage of market power or as legitimate <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct,</b> attention should focus on the effect of that conduct on competition, rather than on the subjective purpose or intent behind it. In characterising conduct it is also helpful to consider whether the impugned conduct has a business rationale or justification. If a business rationale or justification is put forward, the court must assess whether it can be justified objectively, for example, in terms of greater efficiency or enhanced consumer appeal.

40|$|The present work aims at {{studying}} the <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> of Brazilian airlines {{on the main}} routes within the country by using a theoretical model of competition and parametric estimation. The methodology consists of an empirical model {{of supply and demand}} which permits the estimation of a parameter indicative of firms´ conduct in the market, and therefore to test if it is a cooperative situation (cartel rationality) or a non-cooperative situation (competitive market). Moreover, this research aims at incorporating a refinement by using a resampling method called Bootstrap. With bootstraping, it is possible to compute more accurate measures of the standard deviation of estimates and therefore to have more reliable tests of hypotheses on firms' conduct. Results indicated the non rejection of the non-cooperative conduct among firms, meaning the absence of evidence of coordination. Additionally, an episode of exchange rate devaluation in 2002 did not have any effect of soothing competition in the market; on the contrary, it intensificated the <b>competitive</b> <b>conduct</b> of firms.

Labour law states the conflict of employers and employees in economic competition and the related collision of fundamental right to freedom of trade and choice of profession with protection to ownership, but legal regulations of trade law may be applied. The thesis deals with both of these areas and also related criminal legislation. Attention is also paid to the historical survey of these issues and the thesis briefly describes some of the general context of the current Labour Code.
