40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{activity}} of lipase in fermented Africa locust bean, <b>Castor</b> <b>seed,</b> and Africa oil bean was determined. The peak lipase activity for fermented Africa locust bean, <b>Castor</b> <b>seed,</b> and African oil bean were 13. 3 x 10 - 3 µmol/sec, 7. 2 x 10 - 3 µmol/sec and 10. 6 x 10 - 3 µmol/sec at day 5, 4 and 4 respectively. The optimum temperature and pH were 300 C and 7. 0 respectively {{for all the}} fermented seeds above. Increasing NaCl concentration decreases the {{activity of}} Lipase indicating that NaCl is an inhibitor of lipase. The effect of substrate concentration on lipase activity in the fermenting oil seeds shows the normal Michaelis-Menten curve. The Km for African locust bean is 0. 065664 mM, <b>Castor</b> <b>seed</b> is 0. 067625 mM, and African oil bean is 0. 075848 mM.

40|$|Some seeds rely on fleshy lipid-rich {{appendages}} as attractants to ants. By carrying those {{seeds to}} their nest, ants {{play a major}} role as seed dispersers and can provide suitable conditions for seed germination. Ricinus communis (the commonly known <b>castor)</b> <b>seeds</b> are primarily dispersed by autochory but probably present secondary dispersal by ants, once they bear a lipid-rich elaiosome. The following questions were addressed: (1) are ants legitimate dispersers of castor seeds?; (2) which ant species interact with the seeds?; and (3) is germination success higher in a predicted scenario met by seeds discarded from ant nest? We compared the removal of seeds with and without elaiosome and we determined which ant species interact with <b>castor</b> <b>seeds</b> and whether there was seed predation by ants. We performed experiments under controlled conditions to evaluate seed germination responses to light, temperature and elaiosome. Seeds with elaiosome were removed preferentially and no predation was found, indicating that ants are legitimate seed dispersers. A large coterie of ants (20 species) interacts with <b>castor</b> <b>seeds,</b> especially Myrmicinae species. Elaiosome removal enhanced germination success, as well as alternated temperatures and absence of light. Such conditions arc a mixture of two of the three scenarios we assumed for castor seed germination, and are met by seeds discarded from ant nest, but covered by a thin layer of litter, or eventually abandoned inside the nest, but in shallow depths.

30|$|Castor oil is {{extracted}} colourless to very pale yellow viscous liquid {{with a distinct}} taste, mild odour and it boils at 586  K [10]. The hydroxyl group in ricinoleic acid (Fig.  4 a) account for the unique properties of castor oil. For instance, the oil has relatively high viscosity and specific gravity; it is soluble in alcohols in any proportion and has limited solubility in aliphatic petroleum solvents [11]. In addition, the polar hydroxyl group in castor oil makes it compatible with plasticizers {{of a wide variety}} of natural and synthetic resins, waxes, polymers and elastomers [12]. Notable changes on the properties of the castor oil can also be due to several factors such as the method of extraction, seed varieties, weather conditions and soil type. For instance, cold-pressed castor oils have low acid value, low iodine value and a slightly higher saponification value than solvent-extracted oil [1]. It has further been observed that <b>castor</b> <b>seeds</b> from different climatic conditions produce castor oils of different composition and physical–chemical properties [14, 15, 17]. Malaysian <b>castor</b> <b>seeds</b> for instance, contain total lipids (castor oil) reaching up to 43.3  % per dry weight and a saponification value of 182.96  mg KOH/g [14] while for the Nigerian <b>castor</b> <b>seeds,</b> the total lipids (castor oil) is 48  % per dry weight with a saponification value of 178.00  mg KOH/g [15].|$|E

40|$|<b>Castor</b> <b>seeds</b> are {{obtained}} from the castor plant (Ricinus communis L.) of the family Euphorbiaceae. The plant is important {{because of the high}} oil content (40 – 57 %) of the seeds. Basically, the oil is obtained by pressing or solvent extraction methods. Although castor oil is used for frying, it has almost unlimited industrial applications and enjoys tremendous world demand in the pharmaceutical, paint, cosmetics. textile, leather, lubricant, chemical, plastic, fiber, automobile and engineering industries. Also, it has the advantage over other oils because it is a renewable resource, biodegradable and eco-friendly. Many derivatives that have a similar chemical composition as petroleum-based oil can be produced from castor oil. The pomace is used for fertilizer and when detoxified by heating at 140 o c for 20 minutes, it can be used as an ingredient for feed formulation.

Proteolytic activity against PKp was estimated by {{the disappearance of the}} 63. 5 and 54 kilodalton subunits and the concomitant appearance of lower molecular mass immunoreactive degradation products during the incubation of clarified homogenates at 4 °C. The presence of 2 millimolar dithiothreitol accelerated the degradation of PKp. The conservation of the 63. 5 and 54 kilodalton subunits was observed after extraction of the enzyme in the presence of 1 millimolar p-hydroxymecuribenzoate, or 1 millimolar Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, or 10 millimolar iodoacetate. These results reveal that a cysteine endopeptidase was responsible for the in vitro proteolysis of PKp. This endopeptidase is present throughout all stages of endosperm development. Its PKp-degrading activity, however, appears to be most pronounced in preparations from older endosperm. When lysates of purified leucoplasts were incubated at 4 °C for up to 21 hours, no degradation of PKp was observed; this indicated an extra-leucoplastic localization for the cysteine endopeptidase. Although the in vivo subunit structure of PKp remains uniform throughout all stages of endosperm development, the large decrease in PK activity that accompanies <b>castor</b> <b>seed</b> maturation coincides with a marked reduction in the concentration of PKp...|$|R
