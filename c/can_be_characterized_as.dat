5|$|Some critics, {{including}} Murray Rothbard, {{have sought}} to show that Keynes had sympathy with Nazism, {{and a number of}} writers described him as antisemitic. Keynes's private letters contain portraits and descriptions, some of which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> antisemitic, others as philosemitic. Scholars have suggested that these reflect clichés current {{at the time that he}} accepted uncritically, rather than any racism. On several occasions Keynes used his influence to help his Jewish friends, most notably when he successfully lobbied for Ludwig Wittgenstein to be allowed residency in the United Kingdom, explicitly in order to rescue him from being deported to Nazi-occupied Austria. Keynes was a supporter of Zionism, serving on committees supporting the cause.|$|E

25|$|If F is a minor-closed family, then (because of the well-quasi-ordering {{property}} of minors) among the graphs {{that do not}} belong to F there is a finite set X of minor-minimal graphs. These graphs are forbidden minors for F: a graph belongs to F if and only if it does not contain as a minor any graph in X. That is, every minor-closed family F <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> the family of X-minor-free graphs for some finite set X of forbidden minors.|$|E
25|$|To {{implement}} the ideas described in previous sections, one {{need to know}} how to derive a computationally efficient invariant representation of an image. Such unique representation for each image <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> it appears by a set of one-dimensional probability distributions (empirical distributions of the dot-products between image and a set of templates stored during unsupervised learning). These probability distributions in their turn can be described by either histograms or a set of statistical moments of it, as it will be shown below.|$|E
25|$|The {{secure and}} dismissive {{attachment}} styles {{are associated with}} higher self-esteem compared to the anxious and fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about the self in working models. The secure and anxious attachment styles are associated with higher sociability than the dismissive or fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about others in working models. These results suggested working models indeed contain two distinct domains—thoughts about self and thoughts about others—and that each domain <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>characterized</b> <b>as</b> generally positive or generally negative.|$|E
