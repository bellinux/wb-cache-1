50|$|There are 215 common {{birds in}} Qatar. The desert and the {{shoreline}} form an important resting {{site for a}} number of migratory bird species during autumn and spring. Coastal birds include gulls, terns, turnstones, sanderlings, kentish plovers, herons and Socotra cormorants. They are usually observed year-round. Lark species, including hoopoes, <b>crested</b> <b>larks</b> and ashy-crowned sparrow-larks are commonly observed in the desert during the summer. More commonly occurring species during the autumn and spring are swallows, swifts, house martins, warblers, redstarts, shrikes, wheatears, wagtails, harriers and falcons (including kestrels). Four of the primary types of birds which can be observed in deserts during the winter are various types of waders and gulls, coots, and little grebes. Rare birds such as the avocet and red-billed tropicbird breed on the peninsula.|$|R

5000|$|Móger {{composed}} a poetic debate, or tenso, with Gabriel Ferruç in the Ciutat. The poem opens with Móger's line Seny'En Ferruç, vos qui tenit procura. The {{heart of the}} debate is Ferruç' badmouthing Majorcan ladies, whom Móger intends to defend. The women are so angry, he alleges, {{that they want to}} kick Ferruç to death with their cork shoes. Ferruç responds that he will not recant, even if it means death, since the ladies of the city would be only further vilified for killing a man who spoke the truth. Móger reminds Ferruç that the ladies he is insulting are distinguished women with the lonch cap diformat, some type of hat, probably a kind of divided hennin like those Vicent Ferrer condemned in his sermons. Ferruç alludes to Móger's occupation when he responds that at least his adversary can comprehend his reasons sense pintura ... larch presich (without being painted a long sermon). The women look to him like cogulhades ab lur cap mal pastat. This is the crux of the debate: Ferruç finds the Majorca headwear makes the women look like <b>crested</b> <b>larks</b> (cogulhades). The debate concludes on a violent note, unusual for tensos of its time but in keeping with its general tone.|$|R
5000|$|Built in 1904-1905 {{according}} to the plans of architect Ion Mincu, the building was inaugurated on April 27, 1906. The structure has a symmetrical plan, running lengthwise along the city's main street. There are two secondary wings, narrower and less ornate, that run behind to enclose a courtyard. On the one hand, there is a suggestion of Venetian style in the facade, with its tall pointed windows and crenellations; Galați itself was the country's main port at the time. On the other hand, traditional Romanian shapes such as buttons, discs and <b>crested</b> <b>larks</b> decorate the rooftop. Among the materials used are stone from Câmpulung, Ruse, Vratsa and Trieste; rubble masonry for the basement; brick from Buzău and Galați; pine shelves; tile and mosaic floors; stone and oak stairs. The roof decorations, corners and drainpipes were made of zinc plates. The new building had gas heating, running water, drainage and gaslight. Two white marble sculptures by Frederic Storck, Industry and Agriculture, adorn {{the upper part of}} the main facade. Lower down, there are two coats of arms of the county in bronze. There is also a large clock, and every hour, a few bars of [...] "Waves of the Danube" [...] are played. There are crystal mirrors mounted alongside the monumental main staircase, which has a finely decorated balustrade. The floor, panels and large chairs of the reception room are original.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{major impact}} of Plio-Pleistocene climatic {{oscillations}} {{on the current}} genetic structure of many species is widely recognised but their importance in driving speciation remains a matter of controversies. In addition, since most studies focused on Europe and North America, the influence of many other biogeographic barriers such as the Sahara remains poorly understood. In this paper, climate-driven diversification was investigated by using a comparative phylogeographic approach in combination with phenotypic data in two avian species groups distributed {{on both sides of}} the deserts belt of Africa and Asia. In particular, we tested whether: 1) vicariance diversification events are concomitant with past climatic events; and 2) current ecological factors (using climate and competition as proxies) contribute to phenotypic divergence between allopatric populations. Results Mitochondrial and nuclear sequence data indicated that the <b>crested</b> and Thekla <b>lark</b> species groups diverged in the early Pliocene and that subsequent speciation events were congruent with major late Pliocene and Pleistocene climatic events. In particular, steep increase in aridity in Africa near 2. 8 and 1. 7 million years ago were coincident with two north-south vicariance speciation events mediated by the Sahara. Subsequent glacial cycles of the last million years seem to have shaped patterns of genetic variation within the two widespread species (G. cristata and G. theklae). The Sahara appears to have allowed dispersal from the tropical areas during climatic optima but to have isolated populations north and south of it during more arid phases. Phenotypic variation did not correlate with the history of populations, but was strongly influenced by current ecological conditions. In particular, our results suggested that (i) desert-adapted plumage evolved at least three times and (ii) variation in body size was mainly driven by interspecific competition, but the response to competition was stronger in more arid areas. Conclusion Climatic fluctuations of the Plio-Pleistocene strongly impacted diversification patterns in the Galerida larks. Firstly, we found that cladogenesis coincides with major climatic changes, and the Sahara appears to have played a key role in driving speciation events. Secondly, we found that morphology and plumage were strongly determined by ecological factors (interspecific competition, climate) following vicariance. </p...|$|R
