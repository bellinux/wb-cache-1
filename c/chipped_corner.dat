40|$|Monolithically {{integrated}} emitters {{have been}} increasingly applied to microfluidic devices that are coupled to mass spectrometers (MS) as electrospray ionization sources (ESI). A new method {{was developed to}} fabricate a duplicable structure which integrated the emitter into a poly(dimethylsiloxane) <b>chip</b> <b>corner.</b> Two photoresist layers containing a raised base which guaranteed the precise integration of the electrospray tip emitter and ensured that the cutting out of the tip exerted no influence even during repeated prototyping were used to ease {{the operation of the}} process. Highly stable ESI-MS performance was obtained and the results were compared with those of a commercial fused-silica capillary source. Furthermore, chip-to-chip and run-to-run results indicated both reliability and reproducibility during repeated fabrication. These results reveal that the proposed chip can provide an ideal ion source for MS across many applications, especially with the perspective to be widely used in portable MS during on-site analysis...|$|R
50|$|Utilising reject bricks {{that had}} <b>chipped</b> <b>corners</b> or minor {{irregularities}} of shape effected a major saving. Blair Wilson subsequently won the Industry Clay Brick Award for {{creative use of}} brick and the distinctive dark bricks forming a curvaceous box are a strong feature of the design. It was felt {{by a number of}} people visiting the theatre that the slight irregularities of the bricks imparted character and a demand for similar bricks were experienced by the supplier. Externally a small courtyard leading off the foyer proved a pleasant social space for use at intermission. The interior had tiers of seating on all four sides of the building surrounding a central stage. One bank of seats was made removable. The finish was simple and modern with a suspended black ceiling and exposed brick walls. Tunnels under the seating tiers allowed performers to move around the theatre without being visible.|$|R

40|$|Partial {{reconfiguration}} allows {{parts of}} the reconfigurable chip area to be configured without affecting {{the rest of the}} chip. This allows placement of tasks at run time on the reconfigurable chip. Area management is a very important issue which highly affect the utilization of the chip and hence the performance. This paper focuses on a major aspect of moving running tasks to free space for new incoming tasks (compaction). We study the effect of compacting running tasks to free more contiguous space on the system performance. First, we introduce a straightforward compaction strategy called Blind compaction. We use its performance as a reference to measure the performance of other compaction algorithms. Then we propose a two-dimensional compaction algorithm called one-corner compaction. This algorithm runs with respect to one <b>chip</b> <b>corner.</b> We further extend this algorithm to the four <b>corners</b> of the <b>chip</b> and introduce the 4 -corner compaction algorithm. Finally, we compare the performance of these algorithms with some existing compaction strategies [3]. The simulation results show improvement in average task allocation time when using the 4 -corner compaction algorithm by 15 % and in chip utilization by 16 % over the Blind compaction. These results outperform the existing strategies...|$|R

500|$|Shemanski {{petitioned the}} City Council {{to let him}} gift the fountain, which began {{operating}} on September 3, 1926. In 1987, the fountain's plumbing was repaired and a new base was poured {{as part of a}} renovation of the South Park Blocks. That same year, Logan and two other men—David L. Lipman and Jeff Wolfstone, grandson and great-grandson of Shemanski, respectively—approached the Portland Bureau of Parks and Recreation, advocating for the fountain's restoration. During the renovation process, the fountain was thoroughly cleaned, had missing pieces such as finials and urns replaced and <b>chipped</b> <b>corners</b> repaired, and was coated with a sealant to protect it from the elements and graffiti. In July 1988, the fountain re-opened following nearly a year of reconditioning. A dedication ceremony to mark the restoration was held on the afternoon of July 18. One park designer with the Park Bureau said, [...] "the water will be turned on {{for the first time that}} anybody can remember." [...] Lipman, Logan and Wolfstone attended the ceremony. Logan, aged 88, was the only surviving person who participated in the fountain's design and construction. The men offered funds for part of the renovation and the purchase of a bronze plaque that includes the original rendering done by Logan and describes the fountain's history and recent work. Costs for the plaque and renovation totaled $14,000.|$|R

5000|$|According to Information Resources International, in 1993, Doritos earned $1.2 {{billion in}} retail sales, {{one-third of the}} total Frito-Lay sales for the year. Nevertheless, in the costliest {{redesign}} in Frito-Lay history, in 1994 the company spent $50 million to redesign Doritos to make the chips 20% larger, 15% thinner, and rounded {{the edges of the}} chip. Roger J. Berdusco, the vice president of tortilla chip marketing, said a primary reason for the change was [...] "greater competition from restaurant-style tortilla chips, that are larger and more strongly seasoned". The design change {{was the result of a}} two-year market research study that involved 5,000 chip eaters. The new design gave each <b>chip</b> rounded <b>corners,</b> making it easier to eat and reducing the scrap resulting from broken <b>corners.</b> Each <b>chip</b> was also given more seasoning, resulting in a stronger flavor. The redesigned chips were released in four flavors beginning in January 1995.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to design and develop fast and {{efficient}} machines for manufacturing high quality coal logs. During the last three months, efforts were focused on the revision and improvement of {{the design of the}} 300 -ton hydraulic press machine for coal log production. The conceptual design of the machine has been sent to Automated Resources, Inc. for review. Experiments were conducted on threshold binder (orimulsion) concentration. It showed that for binder concentrations below 1 %, the initial weight loss of coal logs (due to <b>chipping</b> of <b>corner)</b> is unaffected by the binder concentration unless the binder concentration is 1 % or more. For binder levels above 0. 25 %, more binder causes less coal log wear after long time or or large number of cycles of circulation through pipe. After 250 cycles in the pipe, binderless coal logs suffer approximately twice the wear of the logs with 1 % binder...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade {{a large amount of}} {{analysis}} techniques have been scaled down to the microfluidic level. However, in many cases the necessary sample preparation, such as separation, mixing and concentration, remains to be performed off-chip. This represents a major hurdle for the introduction of miniaturized sample-in/answer-out systems, preventing the exploitation of microfluidic’s potential for small, rapid and accurate diagnostic products. New flow engineering methods are required to address this hitherto insufficiently studied aspect. One microfluidic tool {{that can be used to}} miniaturize and integrate sample preparation procedures are microvortices. They have been successfully applied as microcentrifuges, mixers, particle separators, to name but a few. In this work, we utilize a novel corner structure at a sudden channel expansion of a microfluidic chip to enhance the formation of a microvortex. For a maximum area of the microvortex, both <b>chip</b> geometry and <b>corner</b> structure were optimized with a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model. Fluorescent particle trace measurements with the optimized design prove that the corner structure increases the size of the vortex. Furthermore, vortices are induced by the corner structure at low flow rates while no recirculation is observed without a corner structure. Finally, successful separation of plasma from human blood was accomplished, demonstrating a potential application for clinical sample preparation. The extracted plasma was characterized by a flow cytometer and compared to plasma obtained from a standard benchtop centrifuge and from <b>chips</b> without a <b>corner</b> structure...|$|R

However, there is still evidence that some theft occurred, as the sarcophagus is <b>chipped</b> on one <b>corner,</b> indicating that thieves have entered and attempted to pry off its lid. There are also a number of extra, unmatched lids amongst the pottery, and the pottery that is present is all moved {{to one side of}} the room.

40|$|Voltage scaling {{is widely}} used to improve SRAM energy {{efficiency}} [1 - 2], particularly in mobile systems with tight power budgets. The resulting energy benefits are limited by the minimum voltage ensuring error-free operation, Vmin, which has stagnated due to growing process variation in advanced technology nodes [3]. Error-tolerant applications and systems (e. g., multimedia) allow more aggressive voltage scaling by operating below Vmin, which is acceptable if errors due to bitcell write/read failures do not perceptibly reduce application quality (e. g., image quality). Unfortunately, in traditional SRAMs bit error rate degrades rapidly for VDD < Vmin [4], limiting energy gains. Under a given quality target, further energy reduction is possible through application-specific methods that exploit the features of data stored in a given application [4 - 5]. However, these approaches are not reusable across applications, and further the energy-quality trade-off is fixed at design time, which degrades energy savings in applications with lower quality targets and in <b>chips</b> near typical <b>corner.</b> In this work, a new and highly flexible SRAM is developed for use in bot...|$|R
6000|$|It was Benares, {{without any}} wide streets or chauks, and yet darker than Benares, {{in that the}} little skyline was entirely blocked by tier on tier of hanging signs,--red, gold, black, and white.

Hong-Kong showed me how the Chinaman could work. Canton explained why he set no value on life. The article was cheaper than in India. I hated the Chinaman before; I hated him doubly as I choked for breath in his seething streets where nothing short of the pestilence could clear a way. There was of course no incivility from the people, but the mere mob was terrifying. There are three or four places in the world where it is best for an Englishman to agree with his adversary swiftly, whatever the latter's nationality may be. Canton heads the list. Never argue with anybody in Canton. Let the guide do it for you. Then the stinks rose up and overwhelmed us. In this respect Canton was Benares twenty times magnified. The Hindu is a sanitating saint compared to the Chinaman. He is a rigid Malthusian in the same regard.|$|R
