5|$|Without {{speaking}} directly of death, both verses {{indicate the}} absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to <b>come</b> <b>near</b> to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{young are}} covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but {{continue}} to roost and hunt with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant parents often aggressively displace birds of prey who <b>come</b> <b>near</b> and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E

5|$|Adams {{is home to}} {{the oldest}} {{building}} on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, the Gotchen Creek Guard Station just south of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Built in 1909, it served as the administrative headquarters of the Mount Adams District until 1916. It was built along a major grazing trail to allow for easy monitoring of the thousands of sheep grazed on the lower slopes. Later, in the 1940s, as the amount of grazing decreased, the station housed the Forest Guards responsible for the area. In 2008, it was wrapped in protective foil as a precautionary method to shield it from a large wildfire, the Cold Springs Fire, although the fire did not <b>come</b> <b>near</b> enough to burn it. Wildfires in 2012 (Cascade Creek Fire) and 2015 (Cougar Creek Fire) also required this precaution, and neither of them came close enough either.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels feed {{largely on}} small {{animals such as}} grasshoppers, dragonflies, lizards, mice, voles, and small birds. The kestrel has also been {{reported}} to have killed snakes, bats, and squirrels. The kestrel is able to maintain high population densities, {{at least in part}} because of the broad scope of its diet. The American kestrel's primary mode of hunting is by perching and waiting for prey to <b>come</b> <b>near.</b> The bird is characteristically seen along roadsides or fields perched on objects such as trees, overhead power lines, or fence posts. It also hunts by kiting, hovering in the air with rapid wing beats and scanning the ground for prey. Other hunting techniques include low flight over fields, or chasing insects and birds in the air.|$|E
5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even <b>come</b> <b>near</b> to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming {{up with a way to}} display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E

25|$|These {{scholars}} {{felt that}} adherence to monogamy would minimise {{the risk of}} oppression because the requirement of meting out justice amongst a plurality of wives would be immensely challenging for any man.

25|$|US385 was an {{original}} {{entry in the}} initial development of the US Highway System in 1926. It originally ran from Comfort, Texas to Raton, New Mexico and did not <b>come</b> <b>near</b> Nebraska. In 1935, most of the routing of US385 was resigned as US87. The current incarnation of US385 was commissioned in 1959 bringing the highway into Nebraska along the new alignment that stretched from Big Bend {{all the way to}} Deadwood, South Dakota in the Black Hills.|$|E
25|$|When the lizards {{approach}} them, Nancy is fascinated but {{a little}} afraid. She remains close to Charlie. Though she does not agree with him, she does find him a small stick {{to use as a}} defense. It is Nancy who comes {{up with the idea of}} lying down in a submissive posture when Leslie and Sarah <b>come</b> <b>near.</b> Charlie follows Nancy's directions in most of the dealings with the lizards. After it becomes clear that the lizards will not harm them, Nancy is excited by their presence. She does everything she can to learn about them and make a connection with them. She wants to shake hands with them first.|$|E

25|$|Some learned {{men have}} thought they {{discovered}} some vestiges of vampirism in the remotest antiquity; {{but all that}} they say of it does not <b>come</b> <b>near</b> what is related of the vampires. The lamiæ, the strigæ, the sorcerers whom they accused of sucking the blood of living persons, and of thus causing their death, the magicians who were said to cause the death of new-born children by charms and malignant spells, are nothing less than what we understand {{by the name of}} vampires; even were it to be owned that these lamiæ and strigæ have really existed, which we do not believe can ever be well proved.|$|E
25|$|While the {{appearance}} on Monday of some 18,000 was reasonable enough, given both the rain showers occurring {{early that morning}} and the large parade held downtown during the afternoon, neither the two days of the Labor Day meet nor the July 4 weekend races had <b>come</b> <b>near</b> to equaling the Memorial Day turnout. While potential explanations for the decline included the high heat of summer and {{the women of the}} city making family holiday plans that did not include automobile racing, one of the most likely, they reasoned, was an overabundance of the very events they exhibited: too many races had diluted turnout down to only those most interested in the sport.|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavata Purana also narrates: Krishna's {{elder brother}} Balarama was staying in Ambadi on Yamuna's banks {{for a few}} months. Once, he was frolicking with the gopis on the river banks and desired {{to play in the}} waters. Intoxicated with liquor and {{experiencing}} heat of the alcohol, Balarama felt to take a bath in the river. However, he refused to walk to the waters and called upon the river to <b>come</b> <b>near</b> him, but the chaste Yamuna refused despite repeated orders from Balarama. An angry Balarama dragged the river by his weapon – the plough and changed its course, hurting the river goddess. Terrified, the river assumed her form as a goddess and bowed to Balarama and asked his forgiveness. A calmed Balarama ordered the river to flood the forest so he could bathe and play in her waters, and the river complied.|$|E

25|$|Marriage customs vary in Muslim {{dominated}} countries. Islamic {{law allows}} polygamy where a Muslim man can {{be married to}} four wives at the same time, under restricted conditions, {{but it is not}} widespread. As the Sharia demands that polygamous men treat all wives equally, classical Islamic scholars opined that it is preferable to avoid polygamy altogether, so one does not even <b>come</b> <b>near</b> the chance of committing the forbidden deed of dealing unjustly between the wives. Most modern Muslims view the practice of polygamy as allowed, but unusual and not recommended. In some countries, polygamy is restricted by new family codes, for example the Moudawwana in Morocco. Some countries allow Muslim men to enter into additional temporary marriages, beyond the four allowed marriages, such as the practice of sigheh marriages in Iran, and Nikah Mut'ah elsewhere in some Middle East countries.|$|E
25|$|On 9 July 1945, Neshoba sailed in convoy to Ulithi, then to Okinawa. This trip to Okinawa did {{not find}} the same {{peaceful}} conditions as prevailed on D-Day. Attacks by kamikazes of the Japanese air forces were in full swing at the time. During the ship's five-day stay there, she was under several air raids, which did not <b>come</b> <b>near</b> the berth, and all hands were relieved when her orders came to depart on 29 July. Once again, it was convoy duty for Neshoba, but one of a very different nature. She {{was not in a}} convoy of ships of her type, but was the mother ship to upwards of seventy craft, ranging in size from LST's down to fleet ocean tugs. Captain Mack was in command of this convoy as it set out for Saipan. During the trip, a small, but very annoying typhoon was encountered, but all ships and craft weathered the storm and sailed into Saipan harbor on 6 August.|$|E
25|$|He succeeded {{equally in}} showing {{the paths of}} the planets when they <b>come</b> <b>near</b> or {{withdraw}} from the earth. He fashioned first an armillary sphere. He joined the two circles called by the Greeks coluri and by the Latins incidentes because they fell upon each other, and at their extremities he placed the poles. He drew with great art and accuracy, across the colures, five other circles called parallels, which, from one pole to the other, divided the half of the sphere into thirty parts. He put six of these thirty parts of the half-sphere between the pole and the first circle; five {{between the first and}} the second; from the second to the third, four; from the third to the fourth, four again; five from the fourth to the fifth; and from the fifth to the pole, six. On these five circles he placed obliquely the circles that the Greeks call loxos or zoe, the Latins obliques or vitalis (the zodiac) because it contained the figures of the animals ascribed to the planets. On the inside of this oblique circle he figured with an extraordinary art the orbits traversed by the planets, whose paths and heights he demonstrated perfectly to his pupils, as well as their respective distances.|$|E
