5|$|On 15 February 1959, it was {{organized}} {{to consist of}} the 1st Battle Group, 65th Infantry, {{an element of the}} 92nd Infantry Brigade. On February 21, 1960, commemorated as National Guard Day, the 65th Infantry Regiment was formally transferred from the Regular Army to the PRNG, in an activity where Gen. Cesár Cordero handed the units colors to Col. Rafael Rodríguez. That same year, Company B of the 65th Regiment created Employer's Day (Día del Patrono in Spanish) where the employer's of the volunteers that serve in the PRNG are instructed about the job that their employees do with the entity and participate in training of their own. The idea behind the initiative was facilitating the processing of the request of leave-of-absence to train for two weeks during the summer. On 1 May 1964, it was reorganized to consist of the 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 92nd. It was reorganized again on 1 April 1971, to consist of the 1st Battalion and the separate <b>Company</b> <b>E.</b> This was followed by another reorganization on 1 September 1978, to consist of the 1st and 2nd Battalions within the 92nd, as well as the separate <b>Company</b> <b>E.</b> Less than two years later another reorganization on 29 February 1980, eliminated the separate <b>Company</b> <b>E</b> while retaining the 1st and 2nd Battalions.|$|E

Jackson killed Ellsworth with a shotgun blast to the chest, and Cpl. Francis Brownell responded in kind by fatally shooting the innkeeper.|$|E

5|$|On 26 July Wilton {{had ordered}} Lieutenant Colonel Peter Jeffreys {{to prepare a}} {{counter-attack}} by 1 DLI to recover some of the ground lost to the Chinese the night before, but after preparatory fire failed to clear the Chinese from the objective the assault was cancelled. The Chinese subsequently made another attempt against the US Marines on Hill 119 {{on the night of}} 26/27 July, but it lacked the weight of those of the previous nights and was easily repelled. In a final attempt to capture Boulder City at 21:30 a Chinese platoon had advanced on the wire at Hill 119, defended by <b>Company</b> <b>E,</b> 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines. Just after midnight another Chinese platoon-sized assault was also halted by the Marines. At 00:45 a Chinese platoon probed the US Marines on Hill 111, yet after an hour and twenty minutes it was also checked. Meanwhile, despite the clashes nearby on Hill 111 the Australians suffered no more casualties. The Armistice Agreement was subsequently signed at 10:00 on 27 July. Sporadic fighting continued, and the New Zealand gunners fired several counter-battery tasks, engaging several Chinese guns. The Commonwealth Divisional Artillery fired 1,300 rounds during the day; by evening the front was largely silent. In the last four hours of the war the Chinese fired 44,000 artillery rounds into the US Eighth Army positions, although none against the 1st Commonwealth Division. There were no further attacks and the ceasefire came into effect at 22:00 the same day. The following day some soldiers from both sides moved forward into no man's land to exchange greetings, although relatively few Australians did so and the Marines were under orders not to fraternise or communicate with the Chinese.|$|E
