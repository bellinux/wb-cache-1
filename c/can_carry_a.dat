5|$|The China National Space Administration offers NASA the Taiyang Shen, a {{classified}} booster rocket that <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> payload to Mars. Meanwhile, JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises a trajectory to divert Hermes back to Mars for a rescue {{more than two}} years earlier, using the Chinese booster to resupply Hermes for an additional eighteen months. Sanders rejects the plan, refusing to risk the crew, but Henderson surreptitiously sends the details to Hermes. The crew unanimously vote for the plan, and NASA — powerless to stop them — resupplies Hermes as it uses Earth's gravity to slingshot back to Mars.|$|E
5|$|Certain weapons can be dual-wielded, {{allowing}} the player to trade accuracy, {{the use of}} grenades and melee attacks for raw firepower. The player can carry two weapons at a time (or three if dual-wielding; one weapon remains holstered), with each weapon having advantages and disadvantages in different combat situations. For example, most Covenant weapons eschew disposable ammo clips for a contained battery, which cannot be replaced if depleted. However, these weapons can overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading, but cannot overheat due to prolonged fire. The player <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> total of eight grenades (four human grenades, four Covenant) to dislodge and disrupt enemies. New in Halo 2 {{is the ability to}} board enemy vehicles that are near the player and traveling at low speeds. The player or AI latches onto the vehicle and forcibly ejects the other driver from the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling is accomplished using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight deck. In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> {{additional}} {{round in}} the chamber, increasing ammunition capacity to one beyond the magazine's limit.|$|R

5000|$|In some languages, certain past tenses <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> {{implication}} {{that the result}} of the action in question no longer holds. For example, in the Bantu language Chichewa, use of the remote past tense ánáamwalíra [...] "he died" [...] would be surprising since it would imply that the person was no longer dead. This kind of past tense is known as discontinuous past. Similarly certain imperfective past tenses (such as the English [...] "used to") <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> {{implication that}} the action referred to no longer takes place.|$|R
5|$|Preceding the Vietnam War {{the high}} speeds {{aircraft}} were attaining {{led to a}} move to remove the cannon due to the mistaken belief {{that they would be}} useless in a dogfight, but combat experience during the Vietnam War showed conclusively that despite advances in missiles, there was still a need for them. Nearly all modern fighter aircraft are armed with an autocannon and they are also commonly found on ground-attack aircraft. One of the most powerful examples is the 30mm GAU-8/A Avenger Gatling-type rotary cannon, mounted exclusively on the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II. The Lockheed AC-130 gunship (a converted transport) <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> 105mm howitzer as well as a variety of autocannons ranging up to 40mm. Both are used in the close air support role.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} {{incorporates the}} use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing auxiliary power unit. The aircraft also features the largest landing gear and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel bogies are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant hydraulic systems with only one system required for landing. A ram air turbine –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the wing root fairing.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} typical pin sizes: 1.57 mm, 2.13 mm, and 2.36 mm. The 1.57 mm pin <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> 5 <b>A</b> of current, while the 2.36 mm <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> 8.5 <b>A.</b> Because the pins {{have a large}} contact surface area and fit tightly, these {{connectors}} are typically used for power.|$|R
50|$|The TOW {{was used}} in {{multiple}} engagements during Operation Desert Storm in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. During the war, both the M2 Bradley Infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) and the M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV) carried TOW missiles. The M2 <b>can</b> also <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> additional 7 rounds, while the M3 <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> additional 12 rounds. Both M2 and M3 medium-weight Bradley Fighting Vehicles destroyed more Iraqi tanks during the war, than M1A1 Abrams heavy Main Battle Tanks did.|$|R
50|$|Heron <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> {{array of}} sensors, {{including}} thermographic camera (infrared) and visible-light airborne ground surveillance, intelligence systems (COMINT and ELINT) and various radar systems, totaling up to 250 kg. Heron is also capable of target acquisition and artillery adjustment.|$|R

The 6X6 version carries four soldiers plus driver and gunner, and together with another Puma 6X6 <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> entire Italian infantry squad of eight men.|$|R
50|$|A {{finger ring}} is a {{convenient}} {{choice for a}} magic item: it is ornamental, distinctive and often unique, a commonly worn item, of a shape that is often endowed with mystical properties (circular), <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> enchanted stone, and is usually worn on a finger, which can be easily pointed at a target.|$|R
25|$|The K-15 Sagarika is a nuclear-capable submarine-launched {{ballistic}} missile {{belonging to the}} K Missile family {{with a range of}} 750 kilometres (466mi). Sagarika <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> payload of up to 500 kilograms (1,102lb). Sagarika was developed at the DRDO's missile complex in Hyderabad.|$|E
25|$|A {{gravitational}} slingshot <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> {{space probe}} onward to other destinations without {{the expense of}} reaction mass. By harnessing the gravitational energy of other celestial objects, the spacecraft can pick up kinetic energy. However, even more energy {{can be obtained from}} the gravity assist if rockets are used.|$|E
25|$|Zyvex Technologies {{has also}} built a 54' {{maritime}} vessel, the Piranha Unmanned Surface Vessel, as a technology demonstrator {{for what is}} possible using CNT technology. CNTs help improve the structural performance of the vessel, resulting in a lightweight 8,000lb boat that <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> payload of 15,000lb over a range of 2,500 miles.|$|E
50|$|The Skywagon {{can also}} be fitted with floats, amphibious float, or skis. The AgCarryall variant of the 185 adds a 151-gallon belly {{chemical}} tank and removable spray booms for aerial application. It is also possible to fit a cargo pod under the fuselage that <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> extra 300 lb (136 kg).|$|R
50|$|A {{tethered}} balloon or a kite {{can serve}} as a temporary support. It <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> antenna or a wire (for VLF, LW or MW) up to an appropriate height. Such an arrangement is used occasionally by military agencies or radio amateurs. The American broadcasters TV Martí broadcast a television program to Cuba by means of such a balloon.|$|R

25|$|Alert warning - People {{without a}} working spleen <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> card, or wear a special {{bracelet}} or necklet {{which says that}} they do not have a working spleen. This would alert a healthcare professional to take rapid action if they become are seriously ill and cannot notify them of their condition.|$|E
25|$|Promiscuity is the {{practice}} of having casual sex frequently with different partners or being indiscriminate {{in the choice of}} sexual partners. The term <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> moral judgment if the social ideal for sexual activity is monogamous relationships. A common example of behavior viewed as promiscuous by many cultures is the one-night stand, and its frequency is used by researchers as a marker for promiscuity.|$|E
25|$|The SRTV is {{measured}} {{to be carried}} internally by the M/HC-130P/N/J, C-130/C-130J, KC-130J and C-17 fixed-wing aircraft {{as well as the}} CH-47 and CH-53 helicopters. It is too wide for the V-22. The V-22 compatible version <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> team of three with two patients on litters in the roll protected cage. The vehicle can be delivered through various methods including Low Velocity Aerial Delivery (LAPS) or via Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS), guided parachutes, methods.|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{relativistic}} magnetosonic soliton, which is electrically charged with a gigavolt potential, is found to exist in a magnetized electron-positron-proton plasma. Relativistic collisionless shocks resulting from such solitons <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>an</b> even larger electric potential at the shock front. GeV electrons and positrons in some active astrophsyical sources may be produced due to acceleration by these electric fields...|$|R
25|$|The {{blood-brain barrier}} (BBB) is one {{critical}} example of protection which prevents toxins and other adverse compounds {{from reaching the}} brain. As the brain requires nutrient entry and waste removal, it is perfused by blood flow. Blood <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> number of ingested toxins, however, which would induce significant neuron death if they reach nervous tissue. Thus, protective cells termed astrocytes surround the capillaries {{in the brain and}} absorb nutrients from the blood and subsequently transport them to the neurons, effectively isolating the brain from a number of potential chemical insults.|$|E
25|$|The Acme thread form has a 29° {{thread angle}} with a thread height {{half of the}} pitch; the apex (or crest) and valley (or root) are flat. This shape is easier to machine (faster cutting, longer tool life) than is a square thread. The tooth shape also has a wider base which means it is {{stronger}} (thus, the screw <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> greater load) than a similarly sized square thread. This thread form also allows {{for the use of}} a split nut, which can compensate for nut wear.|$|E
25|$|While {{increasing}} hematocrit {{means that}} the blood <b>can</b> <b>carry</b> <b>a</b> larger total amount of oxygen, a possible advantage during hypoxia, {{increasing the number of}} RBCs in the blood can also lead to certain disadvantages. First, A higher hematocrit results in more viscous blood (especially in cold water) increasing the amount of energy the cardiac system requires to pump the blood through the system and secondly depending on the transit time of the blood across the branchial arch and the diffusion rate of oxygen, an increased hematocrit may result in less efficient transfer of oxygen from the environment to the blood.|$|E
