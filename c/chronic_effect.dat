25|$|The {{conventional}} treatment method is an intravenous injection with antimony compounds, such as pentostam. Unfortunately, these chemotherapeutics are so poisonous that about 15% {{of the patients}} die from the treaments. To compound the situation, drug resistance has evolved in the parasites against the traditional antimonials. According to rough estimates, about 40% of patients in India are already resistant to this therapy. Another antimicrobial drug amphotericin B is also commonly used. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) has been a drug of choice in India, but is practically useless in Africa because of low effectiveness in the African strain of the parasite. Further, amphotericin B has severe adverse effects. Its acute effects includes nausea, vomiting, rigors, fever, hypertension or hypotension, and hypoxia, and its <b>chronic</b> <b>effect</b> is nephrotoxicity. In 1999 an anticancer drug miltefosine was demonstrated to be highly effective (95% cure rate) among Indian patients. This {{was the first time}} an oral drug is effective for visceral leishmaniasis. Clinical trials showed that the new drug is relatively harmless. The most adverse effects were only vomiting and diarrhoea in 20–28% patients, which were rather mild. The drug has been officially approved in India. The recommended dosage is 100mg per day over a period of four weeks.|$|E

These effects include removing fat emulsion, defatting of dermal lipids, inflicting cellular damage on the epithelium, and increasing the transepidermal water loss by damaging the horny layer water-binding mechanisms and damaging the DNA, which causes the layer to thin.

Moreover, QCT exerts some {{preventive actions}} in treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of {{present study was}} to explore effects of prolonged administration of QCT on changes induced by repeated application of doxorubicin (DOX) in rat hearts. We focused on the ultrastructure of myocardium, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), biometric parameters, and apoptosis induction. Our aim was also to examine effects of QCT on ischemic tolerance in hearts exposed to <b>chronic</b> <b>effects</b> of DOX, and to determine possible mechanisms underlying effects of QCT. Our results showed that QCT prevented several negative <b>chronic</b> <b>effects</b> of DOX: (I) reversed DOX-induced blood pressure increase; (II) mediated improvement of deleterious effects of DOX on ultrastructure of left ventricle; (III) prevented DOX-induced effects on tissue MMP- 2 activation; and (iv) reversed effects of DOX on apoptosis induction and superoxide dismutase inhibition. Moreover, we showed that rat hearts exposed to effects of QCT were more resistant to ischemia/reperfusion injury. Effects of QCT on modulation of ischemic tolerance were linked to Akt kinase activation and connexin- 43 up-regulation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that prolonged treatment with QCT prevented negative <b>chronic</b> <b>effects</b> of DOX on blood pressure, cellular damage, MMP- 2 activation, and apoptosis induction. Moreover, QCT influenced myocardial responses to acute ischemic stress.

Research design is Pretest and Posttest Two Groups Design. The first group was given walking exercise and second group was given feet gymnastic exercise. Number of subjects is 20 people with purposive sampling technique which uses inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects were made to do exercise for 4 weeks with a frequency of 3 times/weeks. Result: Based on the result of wilcoxon test in acute effect (pre and post exercise) obtained p value of walking exercise = 0, 005, p value of feet gymnastic exercise = 0, 005. While chronic effects (pre and post of 4 weeks exercise) obtained p value of walking exercise = 0, 092, p value of feet gymnastic exercise = 0, 24.

As cytokines {{may play}} a role in the adverse effects of haemodialysis, TNFa, IL 1 | 3 and IL 6 were {{investigated}} before the haemodialysis session (<b>chronic</b> <b>effect)</b> and after 30 and 60 min (session effect). We found that haemodialysis exerts a <b>chronic</b> <b>effect</b> on cytokines but the type of haemodialysis membrane, Cuprophan or Hemophan, specifically influences each cytokine. Circulating levels of TNF and unstimulated production of TNF and IL 1 by monocytes were increased in patients dialysed with Hemophan, whereas a greater LPS-stimulated production of TNF was observed in patients dialysed with Cuprophan. Both types of membrane induced a higher production of IL 6 as compared to controls. The alternate use of Cuprophan and Hemophan demonstrated that the production of TNF and IL 1 was dependent on the type of haemodialysis membrane. We also found that Cuprophan induced a reversible decrease of spontaneous and LPS-stimulated pro-duction of TNF, IL 1 and IL 6 during the haemodialysis session. Taken together, these results suggest that Hemophan induced a sustained production of cytokines whereas Cuprophan primed monocytes, probably through the activation of the complement pathway...|$|E

Recent research introduced physical exercise as a potential treatment option, particularly for children with ADHD. The aim of this review was to systematically analyze potential acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>effects</b> of cardio and non-cardio exercise on a broad range of functions in children with ADHD and to explore this in adults as well. Literature on physical exercise in patients with ADHD was systematically reviewed based on categorizations for exercise type (cardio versus non-cardio), effect type (acute versus chronic), and outcome measure (cognitive, behavioral/socio-emotional, and physical/(neuro) physiological). Furthermore, the methodological quality of the reviewed papers was addressed. Cardio exercise seems acutely beneficial regarding various executive functions (e. g., impulsivity), response time and several physical measures. Beneficial <b>chronic</b> <b>effects</b> of cardio exercise were found on various functions as well, including executive functions, attention and behavior. The acute and <b>chronic</b> <b>effects</b> of non-cardio exercise remain more questionable but seem predominantly positive too.

Acute and <b>chronic</b> beneficial <b>effects</b> of especially cardio exercise were reported with regard to several cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional functions. Although physical exercise may therefore represent an effective treatment option that could be combined with other treatment approaches of ADHD, more well-controlled studies on this topic, in both children and adults, are needed...|$|R
