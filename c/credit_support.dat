Under {{the terms of the}} auction, ICS NY had to replace or find a substitute for its <b>credit</b> <b>support</b> agreement, and pay its portion of the plant's outstanding property taxes. But, Dynegy said, the company never did either. [...] ICS defended itself, saying it was making every economically feasible effort to replace the credit agreement. On May 25, 2013, Dynegy filed suit with the bankruptcy court to force ICA to fulfill its obligations. The court imposed a July 31 deadline for ICS to close the sale, but it did not meet the deadline. Dynegy subsequently sought another buyer. Helios Power Capital, a private equity firm, agreed to purchase the plant for $3.5 million in cash on August 20. The court approved the sale on September 2.|$|E
2500|$|Low Temperature Geothermal {{refers to}} the use of the outer crust of the earth as a Thermal Battery to {{facilitate}} Renewable thermal energy for heating and cooling buildings, and other refrigeration and industrial uses. [...] In this form of Geothermal, a Geothermal Heat Pump and Ground-coupled heat exchanger are used together to move heat energy into the earth (for cooling) and out of the earth (for heating) on a varying seasonal basis. [...] Low temperature Geothermal (generally referred to as [...] "GHP") is an increasingly important renewable technology because it both reduces total annual energy loads associated with heating and cooling, and it also flattens the electric demand curve eliminating the extreme summer and winter peak electric supply requirements.
