The physico-chemical characterizations of these booster biocides varied.

The global ban of tributyltin (TBT) has been heralded as a major environmental success; however, substitute antifoulants may also pose risks to aquatic ecosystems.

40|$|Since 1990 s, various booster {{biocides}} {{have been}} increasingly used as substitutes of organotins. However, knowledge about their toxicities on tropical/sub-tropical marine species is significantly lacking. This study comprehensively investigated the acute toxicities of copper, tributyltin (TBT), and five commonly used booster biocides including Irgarol, diuron, zinc pyrithione (ZnPT), <b>copper</b> <b>pyrithione</b> (CuPT) and chlorothalonil {{on the growth}} or survival of 12 marine species in which eight of them are native species of subtropical Hong Kong. We found that Irgarol was more toxic than TBT on the growth of autotrophic species. The toxicity of CuPT was {{comparable to that of}} TBT on almost all test species, while it showed higher toxicity than TBT on medaka fish larvae. As the usage of these biocides is expected to further increase worldwide, accurate assessments of their ecological risks are required for better informed decision on their management.

40|$|Abstract Surfaces {{submerged}} {{in the sea}} are rapidly covered by biofilm and later macrofouling. Biofouling on ship hulls spread exotic species to new habitats and are {{at the same time}} an economical burden. In the past paints with TBT has had great effect against fouling but also had have grave consequences for the marine life leading to an international ban in 2010 and a demand for environmentally friendly antifouling coatings has arisen. In the present project coatings with different active compounds was prepared on microscope slides. The coatings, with both experimental and commercial paints, were submerged for 22 days in the Bay of Oman. The commercial paints had copper and a mixture of <b>copper</b> and zinc <b>pyrithione</b> as active compounds. The experimental paints had zinc oxide, zinc sulphide and aerogel with active compound x, zinc sulphide and aerogel without active compound, zinc sulphide without aerogel, zinc sulphide with commercial protease, zinc oxide without aerogel and titandioxide as active compounds. To harmonize the surfaces black nitrocellulose filters were attached on the slides for bacterial counts with DAPI staining. The filters were collected over time to determine bacterial and macrofouling succession. The bacterial density increased over time for all treatments and most for the treatments with commercial paints. The lowest counts were observed in the Control samples and the engineered paints had counts in between. The commercial paints inhibited quorum sensing in reporter strain C. violaceum CV 017. Community analysis of microfouling by fatty acid analysis, in the first experiment, revealed when statistical analyzed by ANOSIM that the Control differed from most of the other treatments and that the commercial paint also differed from one of the engineered treatments. The statistically analysis SIMPER revealed that the fatty acid community was dominated by few fatty acids present in all the treatments. Differences between treatments were determined by the density among the dominating fatty acids. At the same time a temporal succession in fatty acids was observed. Contrary general assumptions and results the commercial antifouling paints with the highest fouling inhibition had the highest bacterial counts which must result from biofilm development of bacteria resistant to the active compounds <b>copper</b> and zinc <b>pyrithione</b> used in these treatments. The poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) C 18 : 2 ω 9, 12 was found in samples the Control, treatment MUZ and treatments T 40 and T 44 which have been connected to the groups of Cytophagales or Proteobacteria. Fatty acid profiles from several treatments had similarities to fatty acids profiles extracted from fluorescent Pseudomonas. The surfaces with commercial paints had the lowest abundance of macrofouling recorded. The Control samples had the highest algae and invertebrate density and the engineered paints had fouling abundances within the range of the Controls and the commercial paints. The treatments with zinc sulphide without aerogel and zinc sulphide and aerogel with enzyme x had the poorest antifouling activity against macrofouling along with the Control. The commercial paints demonstrated both a broad fouling inhibition against all macrofouling organisms encountered.

40|$|From an {{environmental}} perspective, {{there is a}} need to reduce the amount of biocides from antifouling paints in the marine ecosystem as these biocides can exert a negative effect on the marine life. One way to do this is to optimize the use of biocides in antifouling paints, and thereby avoid unnecessary overdosing. This thesis has been produced within the research program Marine Paint which has the overall aim to produce an antifouling paint with a lower environmental impact than the paints existing on the market today. The aim of the studies presented in this thesis has been to evaluate the efficacy and ecotoxicity of eight antifouling biocides to both target and non-target organisms. The biocides investigated were: medetomidine, triphenylborane pyridine (TPBP), tolylfluanid, copper, irgarol, zinc pyrithione, <b>copper</b> <b>pyrithione</b> and 4, 5 -dichloro- 2 -n-octyl 3 (2 H) -isothiazolone (DCOIT). The target organisms investigated were the macroalga Ulva lactuca and periphyton (i. e. microbial communities). It is important to keep in mind that all target organisms that antifouling biocides are meant to affect, are also non-target organisms when they grow on natural substrates in the marine ecosystem. Therefore, effects on target organisms are not only of interest for efficacy evaluations, but also for ecotoxicological assessments of the biocides. Both the efficacy and ecotoxicity of the eight biocides has been evaluated for the target organisms in settlement assays in which the organisms were allowed to settle and grow in the presence of the biocides. Full concentration-response curves from 0 to 100 % effect were produced to enable future mixture predictions. Such mixture predictions can be used for paint optimization, but also in environmental applications such as hazard assessments. <b>Copper</b> <b>pyrithione</b> was the biocide that most efficiently prevented growth of both Ulva lactuca and periphyton communities, and for Ulva lactuca is was also the biocide with the highest ecotoxicity. Due to different shapes of the concentration-response curves, the toxicity ranking was not consistent at all effect levels (from EC 10 to EC 98), and irgarol was found to be more toxic to periphyton at lower concentrations than <b>copper</b> <b>pyrithione.</b> In order to extend the ecotoxicological evaluations of the biocides beyond target organisms, effects on the non-target organism Acartia tonsa was investigated. Acartia tonsa is one of the most commonly occurring pelagic calanoid copepods in coastal waters world-wide. Effects on mortality and egg production were studied for three of the eight biocides, namely DCOIT, TPBP and medetomidine. It was shown that neither DCOIT nor medetomidine affected the egg production specifically, but inhibition of egg production occurred at the same concentration as mortality. TPBP was on the other hand shown to affect the egg production at concentrations lower than lethal concentrations. Antifouling biocides present in the marine environment can exert selection pressure on marine life and through the process of natural selection induce tolerance development. An extreme tolerance to the antifouling biocide irgarol in a population of Ulva lactuca from the mouth of the Gullmar fjord has been described. This indicates that the use of antifouling paints has made its imprint on the marine ecosystem. The results from this thesis have deepened the understanding of the biological effects of antifouling biocides. The well-defined concentration-response curves gives information on both efficacy and ecotoxicity, and the information can be used in a number of applications where either biocidal efficacy or ecotoxicity is of interest, such as hazard assessments and in the design of antifouling paints...|$|E
40|$|Zinc pyrithione (ZnPT) {{is widely}} applied in {{conjunction}} with copper (Cu) in antifouling paints {{as a substitute for}} tributyltin. The combined effects of ZnPT and Cu on marine organisms, however, have not been fully investigated. This study examined the toxicities of ZnPT alone and in combination with Cu to the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, polychaete larvae Hydroides elegans and amphipod Elasmopus rapax. Importantly, ZnPT and Cu resulted in a strong synergistic effect with isobologram interaction parameter λ > 1 for all test species. The combined toxicity of ZnPT and Cu was successfully modelled using the non-parametric response surface and its contour. Such synergistic effects may be partly due to the formation of <b>copper</b> <b>pyrithione.</b> It is, therefore, inadequate to assess the ecological risk of ZnPT to marine organisms solely based on the toxicity data generated from the biocide alone. To better protect precious marine resources, it is advocated to develop appropriate water quality criteria for ZnPT with the consideration of its compelling synergistic effects with Cu at environmentally realistic concentrations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The toxicity of ZPT and CPT varied between EC 50 -values of 1. 6 - 60 nM for pelagic bacteria, algae and zooplankton communities. ZPT and CPT affected the benthic community nutrient cycling at concentrations over 0. 001 nmol/g dry sediment, especially cycling of nitrogen.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a Bayesian {{model for the}} assessment of inhalation exposures in an occupational setting; the methodology underpins a freely available web-based application for exposure assessment, the Advanced REACH Tool (ART). The ART is a higher tier exposure tool that combines disparate sources of information within a Bayesian statistical framework. The information is obtained from expert knowledge expressed in a calibrated mechanistic model of exposure assessment, data on inter- and intra-individual variability in exposures from the literature, and context-specific exposure measurements. The ART provides central estimates and credible intervals for different percentiles of the exposure distribution, for full-shift and long-term average exposures. The ART can produce exposure estimates in the absence of measurements, but the precision of the estimates improves as more data become available. The methodology presented in this paper is able to utilize partially analogous data, a novel approach designed to make efficient use of a sparsely populated measurement database although some additional research is still required before practical implementation.

40|$|The {{anticipated}} anthropogenically-driven {{climate change}} may ultimately result in increased incidents of temperature extremes {{that will have}} profound implications on the toxicity of chemical contaminants and hence their ecological risks to marine organisms in the tropics and subtropics. We hypothesised that chemical toxicity generally increases with increasing temperature over the thermal tolerance range (TTR) of a species, and is further exacerbated at extreme temperatures (i. e. lower or higher than the TTR). To test this hypothesis, we investigated the acute toxicity of two commonly used antifouling biocides, chlorothalonil and <b>copper</b> <b>pyrithione</b> (CuPT), to the marine copepod Tigriopus japonicus and dinoflagellate Pyrocystis lunula {{over a wide range}} of water temperatures. Our results verified that toxicities of the two biocides, in terms of 96 -h LC 50 (for T. japonicus) and 24 -h EC 50 (for P. lunula), were highly temperature-dependent, although the profile of temperature-dependency varied between the two chemicals. The LC 50 values of T. japonicus exposed to CuPT decreased with increasing temperature between 15 – 31 °C (i. e. assumed TTR), whereas the LC 50 values at 4 and 35 °C were significantly lower than those at 10 and 25 °C, respectively. The toxicity of chlorothalonil to the copepod followed the same pattern of CuPT between 25 and 35 °C but the LC 50 values between 4 and 25 °C were somehow indifferent. In P. lunula, a similar temperature-dependent toxicity was also observed for CuPT but not for chlorothalonil. Such dissimilar temperature-dependent toxicity profiles between the two biocides may be partially attributable to the differences in temperature-mediated modifications of their physicochemical properties, bioavailability, toxicokinetics, and thus resultant toxicity to the test organism. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{presentation}} - Session: RA 17 - Multiple stressors in {{a changing}} worldThe anticipated anthropogenically-driven climate change not only can increase the average air and water temperatures and prolong the hottest period, but also result in increased incidents of temperature extremes that will have profound implications on the toxicity of chemical contaminants and hence their ecological risks to aquatic organisms. In this talk, I will comprehensively examine and discuss the mechanisms of temperature-dependent chemical toxicities to aquatic ecototherms based on both literature review and empirical laboratory studies. Examples will be drawn from an array of marine organisms including amphipod, copepod, diatom, and fish after exposure to a chemical (e. g., chlorothalonil, copper, <b>copper</b> <b>pyrithione,</b> DDT or nano-zinc oxide (nZnO)). In general, we observed that chemical toxicity often increases with increasing temperature over the thermal tolerance range (TTR) of a species, and is further exacerbated at extreme temperatures (i. e., lower or higher than the TTR). Most of the aquatic organisms showed the highest tolerance to chemicals at their optimal temperature(s) where they displayed the highest value of median lethal or effect concentration. For aquatic animals, such universal phenomena can be well explained by the oxygen limited thermal tolerance theory established by Hans Portner. Moreover, the overall temperature-dependent toxicity profiles vary considerably amongst different chemicals. Such differences may be partially attributable to the differences in temperature-mediated modifications of their physicochemical properties, toxicokinetics and bioavailability. For instance, we observed that ion dissolution of nZnO in seawater significantly increases with decreasing water temperatures. The diatoms exposed to nZnO had a significantly reduced growth rate at the lowest experimental temperature {{in contrast to the}} control; this response was probably due to the increased availability of toxic Zn ions at low temperatures. Recently, we have been conducting a novel meta-analysis to address whether an assessment factor of 10 (AF 10) applied to fresh water quality guidelines (WQGs) would be sufficient to account for variation in chemical toxicity brought by thermal extremes. Our preliminary results suggest that AF 10 seems adequately protective. Implications of our results will be discussed in relation to ecological risk assessments of chemical contaminants and derivation of WQGs for protecting aquatic life. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of organotin (OT) compounds were surveyed in four coastal areas of Japan (the Port of Osaka, Maizuru Bay, Otsuchi Bay and Tanabe Bay). Tributyltin (TBT) concentrations {{in water and}} sediment from the Port of Osaka were higher in a marina and a mooring for small- and medium-hull vessels than the other areas. Some alternative compounds were detected in the Port of Osaka; especially, diuron concentration was the highest. OTs concentrations in Maizuru Bay are lower among those coastal areas in Japan. Diuron and Irgarol 1051 were detected in the sediment from Maizuru Bay. Concentrations of Diuron and Irgarol 1051 {{in the vicinity of}} a shipyard and a small fishing port from Otsuchi Bay were dramatically high in comparison with the other sites. <b>Copper</b> <b>pyrithione</b> and Dichlofluanid in addition to Diuron and Irgarol 1051 were also detected in sediment of the area of a small fishing port from Otsuchi Bay. OTs concentration in Tanabe Bay is the highest among the coastal areas in Japan and the {{concentrations of}} alternative compounds were lower than those of OT compounds. OTs concentrations were surveyed in the deep sea environment. In the sediment core of 0 - 30. 5 cm from Suruga Bay, the BTs and PTs concentrations were constant between 0 - 15 cm and subsequently the concentration of these compounds increased, showing the peak between 18 - 19 cm. After the peak, TBT and TPT concentrations decreased. In Tosa Bay, BTs concentrations decreased with the depth, suggesting the spread of OTs contamination from coastal waters. OTs and alternative biocides were detected even in the sediment and organisms from Nankai Trough (4000 m in depth). The highest concentration of TBT in Thailand was detected at an industrial area with shipyards. On the other hand, TPT was not detected in the sediment. The concentrations of TBT in some mussel samples from Thailand were higher than TARL (Tolerable average residue levels). Among alternative biocides, Diuron was only detected. Concerning the marine mammals, the concentrations of BTs were high in the order of whales>dugongs>dolphins and the concentration of PTs in whales was higher than that in dolphins and dugongs. The concentrations of MBT, DBT and TBT in sediment from the coastal water of Peninsular Malaysia were measured. TBT concentrations in Johor Strait were higher than those in other sites in Peninsular Malaysia. Although TBT concentrations in sediment from Vietnam were low, Sea Nine 211 concentrations were high. Thus, the contamination of antifouling biocides has expanded widely from the coastal area to deep-sea environments in Japan and Southeast Asia. The necessity of the continuous research is therefore suggested.

40|$|Anthropogenically driven {{climate change}} not only results in rising of sea {{temperature}} but also {{leads to more}} frequent and longer-lasting cold and heat waves. Meanwhile, coastal marine ecosystems are constantly challenged by increasing threats of chemical pollution. Temperature and chemical stressors can jointly affect the livelihood of marine organisms, but their combined effects are still poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of thermal stress and chemical exposure on the marine medaka Oryzias melastigma, copepod Tigriopus japonicus and rotifer Brachionus koreanus. The four selected chemical contaminants included copper sulphate pentahydrate (Cu), dichlorophenyltrichloroethane (DDT), triphenyltin chloride and <b>copper</b> <b>pyrithione.</b> It was hypothesized that marine organisms {{are more susceptible to}} chemical exposure at both cold and warm extremes. In vivo acute ecotoxicity tests were conducted over a wide temperature range to ascertain the relationship between thermal stress and chemical toxicity. For O. melastigma larvae, the lowest toxicity occurred at an optimum temperature range; the chemical toxicity further increased with temperature increase or decrease from this optimum, and exacerbated at extremely low and high temperatures. For T. japonicus and B. koreanus, the chemical toxicity generally increased with increasing temperature. Such inter-species dissimilarities were possibly due to differences in the uptake route, detoxification mechanism, avoidance behaviour and physiological response between the fish and the copepod or rotifer. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the temperature-dependent physiological and biochemical responses, and thermal tolerance of O. melastigma larvae. The growth in the fish larvae showed an inverse and negatively skewed V-shape relationship with temperature, with a significant reduction in performance at both low and high thermal extremes. A mismatch between demand and supply of oxygen and energy under extremely cold and warm conditions was probably the primary cause of growth inhibition and metabolic impairment, leading to a temporary adaptation by a shift to anaerobiosis and an induction of heat shock proteins (HSPs). Temperatures at both cold and warm extremes increased toxicities of DDT and Cu to O. melastigma larvae, resulting in restricted growth and interrupted oxygen consumption rate. The fish larvae modulated their metabolic pathway and produced stress proteins (i. e., HSPs and metallothioneins) for adaptation to the combined stress. However, such responses were disrupted by combinations of thermal extremes, in particular high temperature, and high chemical concentration. Most importantly, both DDT and Cu exposure significantly reduced the thermal tolerance of the fish larvae. The interacting effect of temperature and Cu was also investigated on T. japonicus. The results showed that their combined effect could significantly reduce the survival, lengthen the developmental time and change the sex ratio of the copepod. Transcriptions of several stress-related genes (i. e., glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferases and HSPs) in the adult T. japonicus were significantly affected by the joint-effect of temperature and Cu exposure, implying that these genes played essential roles in protecting the cellular integrity against the stresses. This study advanced the understanding on the temperature-dependent toxicity of chemical contaminants to marine organisms, and provided valuable information and empirical models for deriving water quality criteria of chemical contaminants at various temperatures. published_or_final_versionBiological SciencesDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
