An understanding of the human history behind cadastral systems is essential to understanding the dynamism of the humankind to land relationship and how this has driven and will drive cadastral reforms. The cadastral concept has developed significantly over the past few decades. During this time these systems, whether developed from a land market or land taxation perspective, have increasingly played a multi-purpose role. Since the time humankind learned to settle on land, <b>cadastres</b> have developed and evolved to suit society’s needs. Changes in the relationship of humankind to land have invoked matching evolutionary changes in the function of <b>cadastres.</b> The most recent examples are current world concerns of environmental management, sustainable development and social justice. Due to this, multi-purpose role <b>cadastres</b> are increasingly seen as fundamental to economic development, environmental management and social stability in both the developed and developing worlds. This paper reviews the trends in the humankind/land relationship and how these have affected the development and applications of <b>cadastres.</b> Restricted Access: This resource is not available from the Digital Repository for copyright reasons.

To perform the cadastral tasks of determining, recording and dissemination of information on land in a 3 D situation, the development of adequate geometric 3 D descriptions should therefore go together with the development of institutional conditions.

40|$|<b>Cadastres,</b> Land Occupancy, and the Ancient Countryside Ancient {{geometrical}} land {{divisions are}} being identified in increasing numbers. Technological advances (coherent light filtering and automatically-drawn modular grids) and new methods (rigorous choice of criteria for orientation and modules) have improved our knowledge in this area. The results obtained in Italy and Gaul in particular reveal the great morphological diversity of land-division {{systems and the}} flexibility of their application. Because of its widespread success, the Roman centuriation into 20 -actus units is the most striking system. Each conquest and regional planning project featured specific modes of territorial organization and patterns of land occupancy. These modes and patterns reveal the adaptability and variety of <b>cadastres,</b> which served as sophisticated and efficient instruments for organizing {{all the elements of}} a territory. As normative and restrictive frameworks for the local population, cadastral grids paved the way for systematic control of space and landscapes.

At the inquiries held after the fire was over, both he and his wife stated that their seven-year-old son had started the fire by accidentally upsetting a candle, but it is more likely that it was the result of carelessness on behalf of the parents while casting candles and that they blamed the child to avoid punishment.|$|E
500|$|Official {{municipal}} boundaries were first drawn up in 1832 in the Netherlands after a <b>cadastre</b> was formed.

They were either added to the larger neighbouring cities or multiple smaller municipalities merged into a larger new municipality with a new name. The number of municipalities reduced from 1,209 in 1850 to 537 in 2000; [...] there are 388 municipalities. During this time, multiple mergers occurred simultaneously in large parts of individual provinces; the {{municipal boundaries}} were basically redrawn in these regions.

This policy changed in the end of the 20th century; local support for the merger is now {{a large part of the}} decision-making process. The larger, merged municipalities are intended to handle an increasing workload because more public services are delegated from higher levels of government to the municipalities. Another reason for municipal mergers is the assumption that larger municipalities are more efficient in performing their tasks than smaller ones.|$|E
