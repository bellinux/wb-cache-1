40|$|Imports are {{increasingly}} becoming a {{significant source of}} Japan’s pork supply. Japan’s share of imports to total consumption increased from 9 percent in 1980 to 24 percent in 1990, reaching a maximum of 44 percent in 1996. Under the World Trade Organization (WTO) safeguard provisions for pork, Japan can raise its gate price by 24 percent when imports in a given quarter are 119 percent higher than the average imports of the last three years of the same quarter. Japan has already invoked the safeguard provision twice since the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) was signed in 1995. In both cases, the level and volatility of retail prices increased; the <b>CIF</b> <b>values</b> of imports increased, making the impact on the government of Japan (GOJ) tax revenue uncertain; the level of imports and stocks increased; and the timing of imports changed. New underlying parameter estimates suggest that the reduction in pork exporters’ profit is three times higher when the Japanese General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) safeguard is invoked, providing foreign pork suppliers an incentive to collude to avoid exceeding the trigger. Workable and efficient allocation rules are constructed with a multi-plant monopolist structure that allows trade of quota. This collusion is welfareimproving since the safeguard induces more inefficiencies, including larger deadweight loss and a shift from low cost to high cost pork supply...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{cracks and}} {{shrinkage}} in soil affects its geotechnical properties in various ways. Permeability of soil changes due to cracks in clay barriers {{which lead to}} development of preferential flow paths for transportation of contaminants. Development of cracks may also lead to decrease in bearing capacity of soil. In case of earth embankments, cracks reduce strength and lead to seepage and percolation problems. Integrity and stability of landfill liners are affected by surface cracks, apart from leachate infiltration. Alignment of embedded pipes can be changed due to the surface shrinkage. They can cause slope instability and can contributes to the land slides in hilly areas. Hence, knowledge of surface cracks and the shrinkage behaviour of soil is essential to improve the understanding and prediction of changes of unsaturated hydraulic properties in heterogeneous and non-rigid soils. This paper {{is an attempt to}} introduce a novel methodology for quantifying surface cracks and shrinkage that appears in soil after desiccation under atmospheric conditions using image analysis technique. ImajeJ software has been used for image processing and Matlab for the calculation of surface cracks and shrinkage area. The samples used for the study is synthetic soil obtained by mixing bentonite and fly ash in various proportions. The effect of variable parameters like sample thickness, moisture content, fly ash content and fibres content on the surface cracks and shrinkage of the bentonite-fly ash mix have been studied. From results it was found that CDF and CIF depends on the chosen parameters i. e. fly ash content, moisture content, fibres content and specimen thickness. There was a reduction in CDF and <b>CIF</b> <b>values</b> with increase in fly ash content and fibres content, while it was increased with the increase in moisture content and specimen thicknes...|$|R

Using a database from the Customs Authority, we link average import unit values at the border with retail prices for the same product and provincial market. Thus, this study provides evidence at the micro or product specific level on the determinants of consumer price changes. The main finding of the paper is that exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) is high and symmetric (similar for appreciation and depreciation episodes). Other transmission elasticity estimates, {{such as the one}} associated to changes in <b>cif</b> unit <b>values</b> or trade taxes, tend to be small or not statistically significant. This suggests that distribution margins may be used to offset changes in import unit values and trade taxes, while changes in the exchange rate tend to be fully transmitted...|$|R

We use a detailed dataset with <b>cif</b> unit <b>values</b> at HS 8 -digits level covering the period 2000 – 2007. Our findings indicate that (i) for a large number of product lines, export margins are zero; (ii) utilization rates are generally high; however, (iii) this does not translate into a positive price margins captured by Mozambican exporters compared to MFN competitors.

30|$|In practice, {{the average}} rate to deliver an express cargo per {{kilogram}} from the coastal cities of China to Taiwan is around NT$ 100. In {{the case of a}} bag from China weighing 70  kg, the total express cost will be around NT$ 7, 000 (NT$ 100 multiplied by 70  kg). Assuming that the express cost is 5  % of cargo value, the bag’s <b>CIF</b> <b>value</b> will be around NT$ 140, 000, which is nearly three times of the tax-free <b>CIF</b> <b>value</b> of one bag (NT$ 50, 000).

30|$|In the 1980 s, the {{air express}} {{business}} was originally operated by airlines that used “on board courier” (OBC) with their excess cargo capacity to transport express cargoes. OBC uses the passenger channel, and the cargo passes through customs inspection {{under the name}} of luggage, with simple clearance procedures and most of the time, with no tax and duties being charged. Not surprisingly, the widespread dispute over the concern of tax evasion for OBC prompted the CA to regulate the weight and value of the cargo to be transported via OBC. For example, the maximum gross weight of a bag should be 40  kg, and the cost, insurance, and freight (<b>CIF)</b> <b>value</b> of each bag should be lower than NT$ 20, 000 (US$ 500). Either the <b>CIF</b> <b>value</b> or the weight of the bag that is higher than the regulated one, along with its document, should be inspected as cargo and be charged with imposed taxes and duties accordingly.|$|E

Economists have, however, been slow to develop convincing measures of trade costs. Commonly cited estimates of the border effect or of trade costs are huge, but flawed.

40|$|As tariffs have fallen, it is {{apparent}} that trade costs are a significant obstacle to international trade and that they vary from country to country. The gap between the <b>cif</b> and fob <b>value</b> of a trade flow is a useful measure of aggregate trade costs, but only if the measure is based on a consistent volume of trade; mirror statistics are unsuitable. Using high quality Australian import data disaggregated at the HS 6 -digit level, we find large country-by-country variations in trade costs. Distance, weight and size account for part of the variation in trade costs. Indicators of institutional quality pick up some of the variation in trade costs, but the relationship is not uniform across mode of transport and commodities; exporting countries’ institutional quality is more strongly related to trade costs for air freight than sea freight, and the relationship is commodity-specific and strongest for manufactured goods. Country-specific characteristics influencing trade costs provide a link between institutions and economic development. Richard Pomfret and Patricia Sourdi...|$|R
40|$|In the {{competing}} risks problem {{an important role}} is played by the cumulative incidence function (<b>CIF),</b> whose <b>value</b> at time t is the probability of failure by time t for {{a particular type of}} failure in the presence of other risks. Its estimation and asymptotic distribution theory have been studied by many. In some cases there are reasons to believe that the CIFs due to two types of failure are order restricted. Several procedures have appeared in the literature for testing for such orders. In this paper we initiate the study of estimation of two CIFs subject to a type of stochastic ordering, both when there are just two causes of failure and when there are more than two causes of failure, treating those other than the two of interest as a censoring mechanism. We do not assume independence of the two types of failure of interest; however, these are assumed to be independent of the other causes in the censored case. Weak convergence results for the estimators have been derived. It is shown that when the order restriction is strict, the asymptotic distributions are the same as those for the empirical estimators without the order restriction. Thus we get the restricted estimators “free of charge”, at least in the asymptotic sense. When the two CIFs are equal, the asymptotic MSE is reduced by using the order restriction. For finite sample sizes simulations seem to indicate that the restricted estimators have uniformly smaller MSEs than the unrestricted ones in all cases...|$|R
30|$|The present {{research}} examined the express consignment clearance system at Taoyuan Airport and identified {{the critical factors}} that induce tax evasion. This study used general and logistic regression analyses in the evaluation. the SECCS captured approximately 39  % of the tax evasion cases, and the inspectors captured the other 61  %. Meanwhile, the two major causes of tax evasion were determined to be the lower <b>CIF</b> <b>value</b> and the false tax code, which accounted for roughly 85  % of total cases. However, the human factor was considered the most significant aspect that influences the system. This finding prompted us to review {{the development of the}} SECCS in Taiwan and to identify the major system flaws. We interviewed senior customs officers and customs brokers; based on these interviews, we found that the loose definition of a “bag” allowed the broker to bundle packages of different consignees into one bag, or separate a large shipment of one consignee into several bags to avoid customs inspection for tax evasion.|$|E
40|$|Delta(9) -Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is {{frequently}} {{found in the}} blood of drivers suspected of driving under the influence of cannabis or involved in traffic crashes. The present study used a double-blind crossover design to compare the effects of medium (16. 5 mg THC) and high doses (45. 7 mg THC) of hemp milk decoctions or of a medium dose of dronabinol (20 mg synthetic THC, Marinol on several skills required for safe driving. Forensic interpretation of cannabinoids blood concentrations were attempted using the models proposed by Daldrup (cannabis influencing factor or CIF) and Huestis and coworkers. First, the time concentration-profiles of THC, 11 -hydroxy-Delta(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (11 -OH-THC) (active metabolite of THC), and 11 -nor- 9 -carboxy-Delta(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THCCOOH) in whole blood were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-negative ion chemical ionization. Compared to smoking studies, relatively low concentrations were measured in blood. The highest mean THC concentration (8. 4 ng/mL) was achieved 1 h after ingestion of the strongest decoction. Mean maximum 11 -OH-THC level (12. 3 ng/mL) slightly exceeded that of THC. THCCOOH reached its highest mean concentration (66. 2 ng/mL) 2. 5 - 5. 5 h after intake. Individual blood levels showed considerable intersubject variability. The willingness to drive was influenced by the importance of the requested task. Under significant cannabinoids influence, the participants refused to drive when they were asked whether they would agree to accomplish several unimportant tasks, (e. g., driving a friend to a party). Most of the participants reported a significant feeling of intoxication and did not appreciate the effects, notably those felt after drinking the strongest decoction. Road sign and tracking testing revealed obvious and statistically significant differences between placebo and treatments. A marked impairment was detected after ingestion of the strongest decoction. A <b>CIF</b> <b>value,</b> which relies on the molar ratio of main active to inactive cannabinoids, greater than 10 was found to correlate with a strong feeling of intoxication. It also matched with a significant decrease in the willingness to drive, and it matched also with a significant impairment in tracking performances. The mathematic model II proposed by Huestis et al. (1992) provided at best a rough estimate of the time of oral administration with 27 % of actual values being out of range of the 95 % confidence interval. The sum of THC and 11 -OH-THC blood concentrations provided a better estimate of impairment than THC alone. This controlled clinical study points out the negative influence on fitness to drive after medium or high dose oral THC or dronabinol...|$|E

The cif/fob gap is a commonly used aggregate measure of trade costs, and Australia is a useful benchmark for ASEAN countries {{because it is a}} large trading partner whose major ports of entry are roughly equidistant from the ASEAN countries. The case for using this Index as a measure of trade costs is set out in the first section. The second section examines the raw data for the ASEAN countries. The third section reports econometric analysis of the cif/fob measure to better understand why trade costs vary across countries and to compare the ASEAN members' record to the global average during the period 1990 - 2007. The final section presents the two versions of the Index, discusses some reservations to using the cif/fob measure of trade costs, and suggests how the Index could be upgraded, maintained and extended.

Statistics show that in the range of 230 - 237 million people, the staple food of all residents is rice so {{it is clear that the}} need for rice becomes very large. This study discusses the application of datamining on rice import by main country of origin using K-Means Clustering Method. Sources of data of this study were collected based on import import declaration documents produced by the Directorate General of Customs and Excise. In addition since 2015, import data also comes from PT. Pos Indonesia, records of other agencies at the border, and the results of cross-border maritime trade surveys. The data used in this study is the data of rice imports by country of origin from 2000 - 2015 consisting of 10 countries namely Vietnam, Thailand, China, India, Pakistan, United States, Taiwan, Singapore, Myanmar and Others. Variable used (1) total import of rice (net) and (2) import purchase <b>value</b> (<b>CIF).</b> The data will be processed by clustering rice imports by main country of origin in 3 clusters ie high imported cluster, medium imported cluster and low import level cluster.
