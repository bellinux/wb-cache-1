5|$|Favre died in 1813, leaving many minor <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> {{substantial}} {{estate of}} more than 5000 acres of land and 57 slaves. He had 13 known children with three different women, and leaves numerous descendants. A well-known descendant is former National Football League quarterback Brett Favre. Simon Favre's associations with property owners and prominent officials demonstrate {{that he was a}} person of very high social standing.|$|E
5|$|In Tempo magazine, Kurie Suditomo {{wrote that}} Ruma Maida {{intertwined}} several sub-plots, including {{the depiction of}} the 1928 Youth Conference, the education of street <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> scene where Sakera discusses architecture with Muchlisin; the review stated that these detracted from the film's comprehensibility. Jakarta Globe reviewer Armando Siahaan noted that several plot lines run parallel, including riots following the Japanese surrender in 1945 and those in May 1998.|$|E
5|$|This {{refers to}} the Seven Sleepers, the Catholic legend of seven Christian children, persecuted for their faith {{during the reign of}} the Roman emperor Decius, who fled to the shelter of a cave where they slept for more than 200 years. Donne, one of six or seven <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> baptised Catholic during a time of strong anti-Catholic {{sentiment}} from both the populace and the government, would certainly have been familiar with the story.|$|E

5|$|While hiking at {{a family}} reunion in 1980, Brodie became unusually tired. She was shortly {{diagnosed}} with metastatic lung cancer, although she had never smoked. Between chemotherapy treatments, she pushed ahead to complete the Nixon study, her three <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> daughter-in-law providing moral and editorial support in her time of need. Knowing that she could never complete a full biography, she ended the manuscript with Nixon's pre-presidential years, lending it an unfinished quality.|$|E
5|$|After Shepard left NASA, {{he served}} {{on the boards of}} many corporations. He also served as {{president}} of his umbrella company for several business enterprises, Seven Fourteen Enterprises, Inc. (named for his two flights, Freedom 7 and Apollo 14). He made a fortune in banking and real estate. He was a fellow of the American Astronautical Society and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, a member of Rotary, Kiwanis, the Mayflower Society, the Order of the Cincinnati, and the American Fighter Aces, an honorary member of the Board of Directors for the Houston School for Deaf <b>Children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> director of the National Space Institute and the Los Angeles Ear Research Institute. Together with the other surviving Mercury astronauts, and Betty Grissom, Gus Grissom's widow, in 1984 Shepard founded the Mercury Seven Foundation, which raises money to provide college scholarships to science and engineering students. It was renamed the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation in 1995. Shepard was elected its first president and chairman, positions he held until October 1997, when he was succeeded by former astronaut Jim Lovell.|$|E
5|$|Charles Harmison's {{older brother}} {{had moved to}} Romney, where he {{established}} and operated a hotel (the Virginia House). In 1867, the brother learned that the Parsons farm was for sale, and he advised Charles to buy it. Charles' wife, who wanted to live nearer to Virginia, also urged her husband to buy the property. Charles did, and he, his wife, their (then) seven <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> young African American boy named Snoden moved from Harrison to Hampshire County in three days. They traveled on the Northwestern Turnpike in an ambulance Charles had bought after the war. Influenced by her childhood home and by its view of the South Branch Potomac River valley, Elizabeth Harmison named their new house and farm Valley View.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Princess Andrew {{was in the}} {{difficult}} situation of having sons-in-law fighting on the German side and a son in the British Royal Navy. Her cousin, Prince Victor zu Erbach-Schönberg, was the German ambassador in Greece until the occupation of Athens by Axis forces in April 1941. She and her sister-in-law, Princess Nicholas of Greece (the mother of Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent), lived in Athens {{for the duration of}} the war, while most of the Greek royal family remained in exile in South Africa. She moved out of her small flat and into her brother-in-law George's three-storey house in the centre of Athens. She worked for the Red Cross, helped organize soup kitchens for the starving populace and flew to Sweden to bring back medical supplies on the pretext of visiting her sister, Louise, who was married to the Crown Prince. She organized two shelters for orphaned and stray <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> nursing circuit for poor neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} that Red House {{was up for}} sale, and as architects {{with an interest in}} Morris, they recognised its historic value. By this point, the Red House had been empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills and his family had left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of dilapidation. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able to afford a mortgage {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while carrying out a project of renovation.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who have young children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not be strictly attributed to the double burden of having <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society. Also, this study was conducted in multiple countries including England, Wales, and the United States which gives the information presented from the study a more global perspective on the double burden.|$|E

5|$|Malone was {{survived by}} his wife Ida and his eight children. Although {{initially}} well provided with income from his farming estate, the depression of the 1920s impacted on the earnings of the farmland and Ida struggled financially. She eventually moved to England with her three <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> daughter from Malone's previous marriage and died there in 1946. His four oldest sons all served in the NZEF, and one, Maurice, was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Another son, Edmond, received the Military Cross while serving with the Wellington Regiment on the Western Front. He died on 6 April 1918, a few days after being wounded.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{grew up in}} Dunblane and {{attended}} Dunblane Primary School. He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says {{he was too young}} to understand what was happening and is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E
5|$|Napier {{assisted}} in the evacuation of British and Commonwealth troops from the island of Crete in late May, following the successful Axis invasion. On one such occasion the vessel embarked 296 soldiers, three women, one Greek and one Chinese civilian, ten sailors, two <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> dog. Returning to Alexandria, the destroyer came under attack but arrived unscathed. Two days later Napier was less fortunate; having taken 705 soldiers on board, she was targeted on her return journey by a formation of twelve German dive-bombers. The ship was struck twice by bombs and suffered damage to the stern, the engine room and boiler room. One of the aircraft was shot down and a further three damaged. Although no allied casualties were sustained and the destroyer arrived safely in Alexandria, she spent the next two-and-a-half months in Port Said under repair.|$|E

5|$|Placing great {{importance}} on learning, Singh contributed to Sikh educational charities and other educational causes. He was {{a trustee of}} the Singapore Sikh Education Foundation that was inaugurated in 1990 to teach Punjabi to <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> life member of the Singapore Indian Education Trust which provides financial assistance to Singaporean Indians for their education. As Chairman of the Sikh Advisory Board, he persuaded the Government to allow the use of government school buildings for {{the teaching of the}} Punjabi language. Classes were conducted by the Sri Guru Nanak Satsang Sabha at two schools on Saturday mornings, and were attended by about 400 Sikh children.|$|E
5|$|Some {{events and}} their timing are unclear during this early period. Sources {{disagree}} {{on whether he}} brought his family to California from Illinois in 1852 or 1854. Carranco dates Seth's first return to Illinois starting in 1850, with his return to California in August 1852, his arrival in Humboldt County in February 1853, another return to Illinois in September 1853, and a trip back to California starting in May 1854 with his mother, two <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> herd of cattle. Thus, {{in the course of}} the six years 1849-1854, he is believed to have crossed the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains five times, travelling mostly on foot.|$|E
