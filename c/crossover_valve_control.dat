40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Compressed {{air leakage}} {{accounts}} {{for up to}} 42 % of electrical energy loss on a typical mine compressed air system. By using underground <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> {{it is possible to}} reduce the amount of air leakage. Underground <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> was successfully implemented in a South African mine. The project implementation and achieved results are documented in this study. The implementation of underground <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> initially requires a large capital investment. In this study the electrical and financial savings realised by underground <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> and surface <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> were calculated. The payback periods for each control strategy were determined and compared. It was determined that underground <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> can realise up to 40 % higher electrical savings than surface control. Depending on the size of the mine and due to the large initial investment, the payback period for an underground <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> system can be up to six times longer than that of a surface control system.

Some of these <b>valve</b> <b>control</b> systems optimize performance at low and mid-range engine speeds, while others focus on enhancing only high-rpm power.

The basic operation of the MIVEC system is altering the cam profiles and thus tailoring engine performance in response to driver input.|$|R
