40|$|A {{series of}} novel {{polycyclic}} structures, with an imidazothiazole central core, were successfully synthesized through the anodic oxidation of catechols {{in the presence}} of 2 -imidazolidine thione, as nucleophiles in aqueous solution. The cyclic voltammetric results indicated that one-pot multi-step sequential reactions occur between the electrochemically derived o-benzoquinones intermediates and nucleophiles affording fused polyheterocyclic compounds. The mechanism of these catalyst-free, tandem reactions are proved as ECECE or ECECCE pathways using potentiostatic and galvanostatic <b>coulometries.</b> In addition, the electrosyntheses of fused imidazo[2, 1 -b]thiazoles have been successfully performed in ambient conditions in an undivided cell using an environmentally friendly method with high atom economy and current efficiency.

In cyclic voltammetry, at a potential scan rate of 0. 2 V s – 1, all substrates showed an irreversible reduction peak [(E p,c) between – 2. 27 and – 2. 54 V vs. {{saturated calomel electrode}} (SCE) ]. Controlled potential <b>coulometries</b> indicated that the apparent charge number of the process involved ranges from 1 to 2.

The charge number {{of the process and}} the ratio between the two different reduction products depended strongly on the structure and concentration of the substrate. Exhaustive electrolyses performed in the presence of variable amounts of D 2 O or in [2 H 7]DMF allowed us to suggest that two distinct pathways are involved in the reduction process, leading to the monomeric and dimeric product, respectively.

50|$|<b>Coulometry</b> uses applied {{current or}} {{potential}} to completely convert an analyte from one oxidation state to another. In these experiments, the total current passed is measured {{directly or indirectly}} {{to determine the number}} of electrons passed. Knowing the number of electrons passed can indicate the concentration of the analyte or, when the concentration is known, the number of electrons transferred in the redox reaction. Common forms of <b>coulometry</b> include bulk electrolysis, also known as Potentiostatic <b>coulometry</b> or controlled potential <b>coulometry,</b> as well as a variety of coulometric titrations.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} {{categories}} of coulometric techniques. Potentiostatic <b>coulometry</b> involves holding the electric potential constant during the reaction using a potentiostat.

5000|$|Bulk {{electrolysis}} is {{also known}} as potentiostatic <b>coulometry</b> or controlled potential <b>coulometry.</b> [...] The experiment is a form of <b>coulometry</b> which generally employs a three electrode system controlled by a potentiostat. In the experiment the working electrode is held at a constant potential (volts) and current (amps) is monitored over time (seconds). In a properly run experiment an analyte is quantitatively converted from its original oxidation state to a new oxidation state, either reduced or oxidized. As the substrate is consumed, the current also decreases, approaching zero when the conversion nears completion.|$|E

As the electroactive molecules are consumed, the current also decreases, approaching zero when the conversion is complete. The sample mass, molecular mass, number of electrons in the electrode reaction, and number of electrons passed during the experiment are all related by Faraday's laws.

5000|$|Sonoelectrochemistry is the {{application}} of ultrasound in electrochemistry. Like sonochemistry, sonoelectrochemistry was discovered in the early 20th century. The effects of power ultrasound on electrochemical systems and important electrochemical parameters were originally demonstrated by Moriguchi and then by Schmid and Ehert [...] when the researchers investigated the influence of ultrasound on concentration polarisation, metal passivation {{and the production of}} electrolytic gases in aqueous solutions. In the late 1950s, Kolb and Nyborg showed that the electrochemical solution (or electroanalyte) hydrodynamics in an electrochemical cell was greatly increased in the presence of ultrasound and described this phenomenon as acoustic streaming. In 1959, Penn et al. demonstrated that sonication had a great effect on the electrode surface activity and electroanalyte species concentration profile throughout the solution. In the early 1960s, the electrochemist Allen J. Bard showed in controlled potential <b>coulometry</b> experiments that ultrasound significantly enhances mass transport of electrochemical species from the bulk solution to the electroactive surface. In the range of ultrasonic frequencies kHz - 2 MHz, ultrasound has been applied to many electrochemical systems, processes and areas of electrochemistry (to name but a few: electroplating, electrodeposition, electropolymerisation, electrocoagulation, organic electrosynthesis, materials electrochemistry, environmental electrochemistry, electroanalytical chemistry, hydrogen energy and fuel cell technology) both in academia and industry, as this technology offers several benefits over traditional technologies. The advantages are as follows: significant thinning of the diffusion layer thickness (δ) at the electrode surface; increase in electrodeposit/electroplating thickness; increase in electrochemical rates, yields and efficiencies; increase in electrodeposit porosity and hardness; increase in gas removal from electrochemical solutions; increase in electrode cleanliness and hence electrode surface activation; lowerering in electrode overpotentials (due to metal depassivation and gas bubble removal generated at the electrode surface induced by cavitation and acoustic streaming); and suppression in electrode fouling (depending on the ultrasonic frequency and power).|$|E
40|$|The {{determination}} of oxide film properties as the relative permittivity epsilon r requires {{knowledge of the}} film thickness. <b>Coulometry,</b> as well as visible reflectometry, are fast and simple methods for determining the thickness of thin anodic oxide films on Titanium (99. 9 %) and a titanium alloy (TiAlV 6 - 4). A comparison of the results shows the specific disadvantages and limitations of each method. On the one hand, the reflectometry yields a too-small film thickness and the authors therefore developed a simple correction algorithm for the reflectometric data. On the other hand, <b>coulometry</b> is not suitable as a thickness determination {{in the case of}} side reactions such as oxygen evolution. However, the complementary approach to the thickness determination, by using both reflectometry and <b>coulometry,</b> brings reliable thickness values of visible reflectometry down to >= 5 nm.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Voltage {{scanning}} <b>coulometry</b> {{was used}} to {{study the effects of}} electrode surfaces and metals on the electrochemistry of the ferric-ferrous couple and the silver ion-silver metal couple. The analytical technique called voltage scanning <b>coulometry</b> is very similar to controlled potential <b>coulometry.</b> The main difference is that in voltage scanning <b>coulometry</b> the potential of the working electrode is scanned through a voltage range rather than remaining at a constant potential. The equations for voltage scanning <b>coulometry</b> were verified for the ferric-ferrous couple and silver deposition on a gold electrode. Indirect evidence is presented relating the activity of the silver deposit to the fraction of the electrode surface covered by the deposit. Evidence is presented showing the presence of both gold and platinum oxides {{on the surface of the}} electrodes. Electrode treatments and their effects on the use of electrodes is thoroughly evaluated in terms of the electrochemical systems studied here.
