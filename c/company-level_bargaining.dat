40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} industry-level tariff agreements in the wage-setting process in Russia. It examines the procedure of industry-wide negotiations, the main institutional characteristics of the agreements concluded by social partners, the interrelations of industry-level agreements with upper-level agreements on the federal and regional levels and with <b>company-level</b> <b>bargaining.</b> The authors present {{an analysis of the}} economic consequences of the Russian system of wage determination. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{right to}} {{collective}} bargaining is {{set out in}} the 1972 French Labour Code. In the last decades, collective bargaining has expanded, {{partly as a result of}} government initiatives. The importance of sectoral bargaining increased with the adoption of the 1982 Auroux laws, which obliged the bargaining parties already bound by a sectoral agreement to negotiate pay annually and to discuss the sector’s job classification system and its economic development every five years. The Auroux laws also stimulated <b>company-level</b> <b>bargaining</b> by making annual negotiations on pay and working time obligatory in companies with union representation.

40|$|ABSTRACT ■ This study {{analyses}} {{recent changes}} in collective bargaining institutions and their implications for employer strategies in the French and German telecommunications industries, drawing on case studies and survey data from call centre workplaces. Findings demonstrate that differences in both formal institutions and past logics of action influenced actor responses to changing markets and ownership structures. French trade unions were more successful in establishing encompassing bargaining structures and reducing pressures for pay differentiation, due to state support for the mandatory extension of agreements and unions ’ strategic focus on centralizing bargaining. In contrast, bargaining in Germany has become increasingly fragmented and decentralized as unions and works councils focused on <b>company-level</b> <b>bargaining</b> at major employers. This focus allowed worker representatives to preserve their strong influence over employment practices in core workplaces but has contributed to declining bargaining coverage and growing wage inequality...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to present}} an {{analysis}} of the nature and drivers of <b>company‐level</b> concession <b>bargaining</b> during the financial crisis 2008 ‐ 10 in Germany. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on five company case studies. Data collection methods include document analysis and semi‐structured interviews. Findings – Using the five cases, it was possible to identify different ways in which companies were affected by the financial crisis itself, by various company‐level adjustment strategies, and by various implications of the crisis and the collective agreements resulting from it. The author found that company‐level social partners, supported by public policies, were able to avoid redundancies and keep employees in work, while helping the company to survive. Practical implications – The findings show that social partners at company level are able to agree on cooperative solutions to reduce labour costs in order to ensure the company's viability. Originality/value – The findings are important for understanding key aspects of the German “job miracle” both during and after the global financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade life-course {{arrangements}} have been introduced in several EU Member States {{with the aim of}} enhancing in a coherent way individual flexibility and employability over an employee's whole working life. In this article we examine the effects of existing schemes with a life-course dimension in terms of employability, comparing four schemes in three countries. The conclusion we arrive at is that the schemes are mainly used for early retirement or achieving short-term benefits, while the uptake of provisions specifically related to employability is not very high. More attractive forms of working-life accounts should refocus on easily accessible basic schemes with short-term objectives and endowed with a sufficient budget for achieving long-term employability goals. They need to be underpinned and supplemented by collectively <b>bargained</b> <b>company-level</b> agreements. © European Trade Union Institute 2011...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe use {{of digital}} {{tools in the}} {{employment}} relationship blurs the boundaries between work time and personal time. In 2002, an Author theorized the “right to disconnect” as the right “to private life of the 21 st century”. The same right has just been recognized by Loi Travail. This legislative provision, however, does not give a definition {{of the right to}} disconnect. It refers to <b>company-level</b> collective <b>bargaining</b> (concerning the quality of life at work) or, failing this, to the employer decisions for what concern the rules regarding disconnession. It’s worth distinguishing two aspects: the right to disconnect at work (to solve the problems arising from hyper-connection) and the right to disconnect from work (to guarantee rest periods, leave and personal life). By considering rest periods and personal life, the law establishes the right to disconnect from work and by incorporating this right into the matter of quality of life at work, it establishes as well disconnection at work. The main question is whether the legislative framework is able to reach both these goals. The article highlights some issues concerning especially disconnection from work The A. discusses the adequacy of the legislative framework, considering that the discipline of disconnection, included in collective bargaining on professional equality and quality of life at work, ends up being not enough coordinated with time and workload regulation...|$|R
30|$|With {{the end of}} the {{national}} agreement in 2010, government’s intervention was the only source of coordination in Greece. There is some evidence that before 2010 ‘protected’ sectors (the public utilities and state monopolies such as electricity, telecommunications, airways, banking, railways, etc.) had a wage-leadership role, compared to the ‘exposed’ sectors mainly in manufacturing and commerce.” (Ioannou 1998 : 103), but that surely ended and the current situation is one of enterprise bargaining with no horizontal coordination. Ireland has moved back to mostly uncoordinated <b>company-level</b> <b>bargaining</b> after the end of 22  years of tripartite wage agreements. The Irish trade union confederation and business association did not break off relationships altogether but signed a protocol with some ground rules for company-level negotiations but these do neither try to provide horizontal coordination on pay demands or settlements nor do they establish firm rules for settling conflicts over union recognition, a hotly disputed issue already before the break down of social partnership (Regan 2013).|$|E
30|$|Some {{noticeable}} trends {{include the}} special cases of decentralization from centralized cross-industry bargaining in the Scandinavian group of nations, although the sister Nordic country, Finland, has since {{returned to the}} fold of centralized, tax-based income policies; the dramatic changes in Ireland from centralized bargaining under successive regimes of social pacts to a restoration of <b>company-level</b> <b>bargaining</b> after 2009; and the opposing trends toward and away from central bargaining in Belgium and the Netherlands, respectively. 11 Comparing the frequencies of dominant bargaining levels over the interval 1960 – 2010, {{it is the case}} that industry bargaining which had come to dominate by 1980 has continued to do so in Western European nations. That said, the importance of enterprise bargaining in the large majority of the CEE nations gives primacy to that form of bargaining on a head count of the 30 nations in Visser’s sample. For its part, centralized bargaining is not entirely a thing of the past, given the nature of the national agreement in Greece in 2010, its resurrection in Finland, and government restrictions on wage increases in Belgium.|$|E
40|$|The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} a revival {{of interest in the}} role of labour in political and economic restructuring. Following a period in the 1980 s and early 1990 s when trade unions and employees were routinely portrayed as passive victims of corporate restructuring, the past ten years have seen a resurgence of work by geographers highlighting the continued agency of labour. Despite this ‘new labour geography’, however, there has been little empirical research examining the uneven development of employment relations at a broad industry level. We address this issue by examining the changing geography of employment regulation in the UK’s privatised rail industry. A major shift in the scale at which industrial relations are organised has taken place under privatisation, away from national collective bargaining to a system of localised company bargaining. On the basis of secondary data gathered from industry sources, we provide an initial assessment of key outcomes of employment change in the rail industry. Our analysis indicates that considerable disparities in pay and conditions exist between different groups of workers, companies, and regions, although these are perhaps less extreme than suggested by the unions. In addition, the number of industrial disputes has escalated in the aftermath of privatisation. Moreover, instead of the set piece national strikes {{that took place in the}} nationalised industry, the majority of this strike action has been conducted against particular operators at the local and regional scales, reflecting the logic of <b>company-level</b> <b>bargaining.</b> At the same time, the membership of the three main unions has actually increased in recent years against a backdrop of long-term decline, suggesting that the decentralisation of collective bargaining presents unions with opportunities as well as challenges. ...|$|E
30|$|Associational governance, here {{collective}} bargaining between trade unions and either individual firms {{or groups of}} employers, is normally associated with reinforcing labour-market security, and is often criticized for doing so {{at the expense of}} flexibility and therefore in unsustainable ways. Alternatively, it may achieve a balance between security and flexibility by enforcing distinctions between insiders and outsiders. However, because {{collective bargaining}} involves negotiation and is capable of operating at a strategic level, it is possible for the participants in bargaining to trade flexibility and security. This can happen under a variety of contexts, but not all. For example, when bargaining takes place {{at the level of the}} individual firm, workers' representatives may have to trade the short-term protection of their members' security against possible needs for flexibility if the firm is to survive and thrive. This is generally known as concession bargaining. Alternatively, unions may protect the positions of current insiders at the expense of outsiders, through such formulae as “first in, last out” (which tends to discriminate against young workers, as discussed above), or discriminating between a permanent core work force and one on temporary contracts. Economists' theories of trade unions regard these practices as axiomatic to how unions operate (e.g. Blanchard and Summers 1986; Rueda 2005, 2007). This is because they assume a model of <b>company-level</b> <b>bargaining</b> (as in the US and Japanese cases). But a union with members across an entire industry or other generally defined labour market is likely to see such arrangements as leading eventually to employers' preferring the creation of temporary and insecure contracts over stable ones. For example, in Spain, the European country where most use is made of temporary contracts, unions oppose the strategy (Talani and Cerviño 2003).|$|E
