5|$|Basic to {{the second}} group is a clade {{consisting}} of both species sofar included in Ploceus that live on Madagascar, P. nelicourvi and P. sakalava, and these are morphologically very distinct from the remaining species. These two species <b>could</b> <b>in</b> future be assigned to the genus Nelicurvius that was erected by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850, but which was merged with Ploceus later on. This second group further contains the genera Malimbus and Anaplectes, and all remaining Ploceus species.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Horner {{admitted}} that specimen TMP2002.76.1 {{seemed to indicate}} that Achelousaurus was not descended from Einiosaurus, as it preceded both in age, and yet had a nasal boss. But he stressed {{that even if the}} lineages split off, its ancestor might have resembled Einiosaurus. Furthermore, it might still be possible that Einiosaurus was a direct descendant of Rubeosaurus. Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species <b>could</b> <b>in</b> his opinion still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea.|$|E

5|$|In {{between his}} various duties and responsibilities, Nansen had {{continued}} to take skiing holidays when he <b>could.</b> <b>In</b> February 1930, aged 68, he took a short break in the mountains with two old friends, who noted that Nansen was slower than usual and appeared to tire easily. On his return to Oslo he was laid up for several months, with influenza and later phlebitis, and was visited on his sickbed by King Haakon VII.|$|E

Not particularly well-off financially, he had to work full-time and throughout his career could not afford to take too much time away from business. He played cricket as often as he <b>could</b> <b>in</b> the summer; when unable to play for Middlesex, he played weekend club cricket—including for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC)—and country house cricket.|$|E

However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The only exception is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.|$|E

5|$|The {{important}} {{mathematical constant}} , sometimes called Euler's number, is approximately equal to 2.718 {{and is the}} base of the natural logarithm. Although exponentiation of e <b>could,</b> <b>in</b> principle, be treated the same as exponentiation of any other real number, such exponentials turn out to have particularly elegant and useful properties. Among other things, these properties allow exponentials of e to be generalized in a natural way to other types of exponents, such as complex numbers or even matrices, while coinciding with the familiar meaning of exponentiation with rational exponents.|$|E

However, the link between genetics and self-harm in otherwise healthy patients is largely inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|A few {{physicists}} {{persisted in}} developing semiclassical models in which electromagnetic radiation is not quantized, but matter appears {{to obey the}} laws of quantum mechanics. Although the evidence from chemical and physical experiments {{for the existence of}} photons was overwhelming by the 1970s, this evidence could not be considered as absolutely definitive; since it relied on the interaction of light with matter, and a sufficiently complete theory of matter <b>could</b> <b>in</b> principle account for the evidence. Nevertheless, all semiclassical theories were refuted definitively in the 1970s and 1980s by photon-correlation experiments. Hence, Einstein's hypothesis that quantization is a property of light itself is considered to be proven.|$|E

5|$|According to the thirteenth-century Historia Gruffud vab Kenan, {{the mother}} of Cynan's son was Ragnailt ingen Amlaíb, a {{paternal}} granddaughter of Sitriuc. Further revealed by this source {{is the fact that}} this woman's father, Amlaíb mac Sitriuc, built and commanded a Welsh fortress called Castell Avloed. Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 another son of Sitriuc was slain in Wales by an apparent kinsman, an event which could be evidence of a struggle for control of the site. Echmarcach's aforesaid expulsion of Sitriuc from Dublin in the same year <b>could</b> <b>in</b> turn indicate that this exiled monarch sought refuge in Wales.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, Berlin {{had been}} {{divided into four}} sectors {{controlled}} by the Allies: the US, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France. The sector borders inside the city <b>could</b> <b>in</b> general be used freely for passage out of the German Democratic Republic, even after {{the border between the}} Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR had been continually closed off, starting in 1952. The outer border of West Berlin, which was also the border between West-Berlin and the GDR, had also been closed down in 1952. During the night of 12 to 13 August 1961 the National People's Army, the German Border Police, the Volkspolizei and the Combat Groups of the Working Class locked down all passages between the Soviet sector and the three West sectors; construction of border protection facilities began.|$|E
5|$|After departing {{the area}} {{he reached the}} west coast, but Braham had loitered for too long. He spotted two Fw 190s {{approaching}} fast from the east. Braham had shot down two of these machines in a Mosquito but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been. There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single-engine fighters for long. He decided to turn and fight while he still <b>could.</b> <b>In</b> a head-on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire. The instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches. Braham dived to the sea levelling out below 100 feet. He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire. The German pilot shared Braham's philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down. The Mosquito was hit again and Braham crash-landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour.|$|E

5|$|Although Rome {{at first}} rejoiced at {{the demise of}} Sejanus, the city quickly plunged into more {{extensive}} trials, as Tiberius persecuted all those who <b>could</b> <b>in</b> any way be tied to the schemes of Sejanus or had courted his friendship. The Senatorial ranks were purged; the hardest hit were those families with political ties to the Julians. Even the imperial magistracy was not exempted from Tiberius' wrath. Arrests and executions were now supervised by Naevius Sutorius Macro. The political turmoil continued until the death of Tiberius in AD 37, after which he was succeeded by Caligula.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{cross-sections}} {{of these}} fusion-evaporation reactions increase with the asymmetry of the reaction, titanium {{would be a}} better projectile than chromium for the synthesis of element 121. This necessitates an einsteinium target, since titanium has 22 protons and the remaining 99 must be supplied by the target, and einsteinium is element 99. This poses severe challenges due to the significant heating and damage of the target due to the high radioactivity of einsteinium-254, but it would probably be the most promising approach to element 119 with 48Ca beams and possibly element 121 with 50Ti beams. It would also require working on a smaller scale due to the lower amount of 254Es that can be produced. This small-scale work <b>could</b> <b>in</b> the near future only be carried out in Dubna's SHE-factory.|$|E
5|$|Charles had won {{one of his}} {{greatest}} victories at Grodno 1706, by simply cutting off his opponents' resources and supplies. Later, {{in a letter to}} his ally Frederick IV of Denmark, Peter I confirmed losses of up to 17,000 men during the encirclement and retreat. After his pursuit of the Russian army, having chased them out of Lithuania, Charles saw his opportunity to march back to Poland in order to meet up with Rehnskiöld, in preparation for the invasion of Saxony. He arrived there in August 5. Meanwhile, Schulenburg did what he <b>could</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to increase the Saxon army to measure the expected invasion from the Swedes, something which was proven close to impossible after the battle of Fraustadt. In a last attempt to stop the invasion, Augustus II of Saxony offered Courland to Sweden and Lithuania to the newly crowned king Stanisław I of Poland. The generous offer was, however denied by Charles who crossed the Saxon border in September 5. As Saxony was close to defenseless, the Swedes could easily push away any resisting troops. In September 19, they occupied the city of Leipzig which finally forced Augustus into unconditional peace under Swedish terms. Among other things, the traitor and second principal behind the Grodno campaign, Johann Patkul was turned into Swedish custody.|$|E
