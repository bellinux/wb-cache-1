25|$|Historically, Kashmir {{became known}} {{worldwide}} when Cashmere wool was exported to other regions and nations (exports have ceased due to decreased abundance of the <b>cashmere</b> <b>goat</b> and increased competition from China). Kashmiris are well adept at knitting and making Pashmina shawls, silk carpets, rugs, kurtas, and pottery. Saffron, too, is grown in Kashmir. Efforts are on to export the naturally grown {{fruits and vegetables}} as organic foods mainly to the Middle East. Srinagar {{is known for its}} silver-work, papier-mâché, wood-carving, and the weaving of silk. The economy was badly damaged by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which, as of 8 October 2005, resulted in over 70,000 deaths in the Pakistan-controlled part of Kashmir and around 1,500 deaths in Indian controlled Kashmir. The Indian-administered portion of Kashmir is believed to have potentially rich rocks containing hydrocarbon reserves.|$|E

2500|$|The spun fibers are {{generally}} divided into animal fibers, plant and synthetic fibers. [...] These fiber types are chemically different, corresponding to proteins, carbohydrates and synthetic polymers, respectively. [...] Animal fibers include silk, but generally are long hairs of {{animals such as}} sheep (wool), goat (angora, or <b>cashmere</b> <b>goat),</b> rabbit (angora), llama, alpaca, dog, cat, camel, yak, and muskox (qiviut). [...] Plants used for fibers include cotton, flax (for linen), bamboo, ramie, hemp, jute, nettle, raffia, yucca, coconut husk, banana fiber, soy and corn. [...] Rayon and acetate fibers are also produced from cellulose mainly derived from trees. [...] Common synthetic fibers include acrylics, polyesters such as dacron and ingeo, nylon and other polyamides, and olefins such as polypropylene. [...] Of these types, wool is generally favored for knitting, chiefly owing to its superior elasticity, warmth and (sometimes) felting; however, wool is generally less convenient to clean {{and some people are}} allergic to it. [...] It is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk. [...] Even within a type of fiber, there can be great variety in the length and thickness of the fibers; for example, Merino wool and Egyptian cotton are favored because they produce exceptionally long, thin (fine) fibers for their type.|$|E

50|$|Feral goats came to Australia {{with the}} first fleet in 1788. For instance, <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> were brought into South Australia in 1837. In the 1860s, angora and <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> were {{imported}} from Asia in an order to start a goat fibre industry. Some herds were set free when the industry collapsed in the 1920s. Goats were also taken around Australia with settlers, railway construction groups and miners. The recent populations of the feral goat have established from goats used to control weeds in plantation forests and woody weeds in inland New South Wales and Queensland. The current feral goat populations in Australia represent a mixture of these origins.|$|R
40|$|Objectively {{comparing}} <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> {{with different}} <b>cashmere</b> production, mean fibre diameter (MFD) and staple length (SL) {{is difficult for}} farmers. We aimed to develop indices to enable cashmere producers to identify productive goats within their own farms once adjustments had been made for the primary determinants of cashmere production. That is we aimed to develop indices that identify goats and herds that biologically have a high fleece weight in relation to MFD and SL. We used a sample of 1244 commercial <b>cashmere</b> fleeces from <b>goats</b> originating from many Australian farms based in different environmental zones and a previously developed general linear model that related the logarithm of clean cashmere production (CCMwt) and any other potential determinant. In the present study, sub-models were investigated {{in order to develop}} new indices for comparing goats in the same farm, based on fleece characteristics and biological efficiency. New Index (MFD), equal to 6. 02 ×CCMwt/ 1. 1531 MFD, was developed to identify animals of biologically high CCMwt in relation to their MFD. Unlike previously reported results that MFD is not a useful measurement for comparing the biological efficiency of <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> across farms, the New Index (MFD) allows comparison of the biological efficiency of <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> within farms. New Index (SL), equal to 2. 70 × CCMwt/ 1. 1414 SL, was developed to identify animals of biologically high CCMwt in relation to their SL. New Index (SL) is very similar to the Clean Cashmere Staple Length Index (CCSLI) that had been previously reported for comparison of <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> across farms, and thus the CCSLI can be usefully used for comparing the biological efficiency of <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> both across and within farms. New Index MFD, SL = 8. 90 × CCMwt/ 1. 243 (MFD+SL) / 2 was developed to identify animals of biologically high CCMwt in relation to both their MFD and SL within farms, and provides useful information above using either New Index (MFD) or CCSLI. The indices can be presented in the same measurement units as fleece weight, which is a biological concept easily understood by cashmere producers, and enable comparisons to be made between animals using just one attribute, clean cashmere weight...|$|R

50|$|Most goats have softer {{insulating}} hairs {{nearer the}} skin, and longer guard {{hairs on the}} surface. The desirable fiber for the textile industry is the former, and it goes by several names (down, cashmere and pashmina). The coarse guard hairs are of little value as they are too coarse, difficult to spin and difficult to dye. The <b>cashmere</b> <b>goat</b> produces a commercial quantity of cashmere wool, {{which is one of}} the most expensive natural fibers commercially produced; cashmere is very fine and soft.

For the fine underdown to be sold and processed further, it must be de-haired. De-hairing is a mechanical process that separates the coarse hairs from the fine hair.

40|$|The {{impact of}} dietary 2 -hydroxy- 4 -(methylthio) butyric acid {{isopropyl}} ester (HMBi) on rumen fermentation in <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> was investigated {{to determine the}} effect of this ester on cashmere production. Four healthy castrated Liaoning <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> with permanent rumen cannulas were assayed for four periods. In each period, goats were fed a different diet: control diet (containing 0 % MetaSmart (an HMBi product)), diet I (containing 0. 85 % MetaSmart), diet II (containing 1. 27 % MetaSmart) or diet III (containing 1. 70 % MetaSmart). Rumen pH, ammonia-N concentration, volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations and total protein concentration were determined after feeding in each period. Results showed that rumen pH significantly increased and rumen ammonia-N concentration significantly decreased when the diet was supplemented with 0. 85 %, 1. 27 % and 1. 70 % MetaSmart. Diets with 1. 27 % and 1. 70 % MetaSmart increased rumen total VFA concentration, and 3 hours post feeding all three HMBi diets increased acetic acid concentration. Rumen total protein concentration significantly increased in the goats fed 1. 27 % or 1. 70 % MetaSmart. Thus, diets supplemented with HMBi significantly affected rumen pH, ammonia-N concentration, VFA concentrations and total protein content.

40|$|The fleece of <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> {{contains}} two distinct populations of fibers, a short and fine non-medullated insulating cashmere fiber {{and a long}} and coarse medullated guard hair. The former is produced by secondary follicles (SFs) and the later by primary follicles (PFs). Evidence suggests that the induction of PFs and SFs may require different signaling pathways. The regulation of BMP 2 / 4 signaling by noggin and Edar signaling via Downless genes are essential for the induction of SFs and PFs, respectively. However, these differently expressed genes of the signaling pathway cannot directly distinguish between the PFs and SFs. In this study, we selected RNA samples from 11 PFs and 7 SFs that included 145, 525 exons. The pathway analysis of 4512 differentially expressed exons revealed that the most statistically significant metabolic pathway {{was related to the}} ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway (UMPP) (P< 3. 32 x 10 - 7). In addition, the 51 exons of the UMPP that were differentially expressed between the different types of hair follicle (HFs) were compared by cluster analysis. This resulted in the PFs and SFs being divided into two classes. The expression level of two selected exons was analyzed by qRT-PCR, and the results indicated that the expression patterns were consistent with the deep sequencing results obtained by RNA-Seq. Based on the comparative transcriptome analysis of 18 HFs from <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats,</b> a large number of differentially expressed exons were identified using a high-throughput sequencing approach. This study suggests that UMPP activation is a prominent signaling pathway for distinguishing the PFs and SFs of <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats.</b> It is also a meaningful contribution to the theoretical basis of the biological study of the HFs of <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> and other mammals...|$|R

40|$|The LIM {{homeobox}} transcription factor  4 (LHX 4) gene plays {{a critical}} role in regulating the development of the pituitary and the secretion of growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) associated with reproduction. Thus this gene may affect litter size. Herein, the aim {{of this study is to}} detect the novel insertion/deletion (indel) within the LHX 4 gene as well as to test its association with litter size in 1149 Shaanbei white <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats.</b> Herein, a novel 12  bp indel (NC_ 030823. 1 :g. 60001011 _ 60001022 delGGGGAGGAGGGG) was firstly found, which was located in the first intron. Meanwhile, three genotypes were detected in Shaanbei white <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats,</b> and the allelic frequencies of I and D were 0. 593 and 0. 407, respectively. Interestingly, the genotype distributions between mothers of single-lamb (n [*]=[*] 895) and multi-lamb (n [*]=[*] 254) groups within Shaanbei white <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> were significantly different, implying that the 12  bp indel might affect the litter size. Furthermore, the association analysis was carried out to find out that the 12  bp indel was significantly associated with litter size in the analyzed goat population (P  [*]<[*]  0. 05). The litter sizes of genotype DD and ID individuals were superior to those of genotype II (P  [*]<[*]  0. 05).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the changes of the Monodeiodinase (MD) gene mRNA in skin of <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> from the initiation of cashmere fibre growth to normal growth. The Melatonin (MT) implants were used in order to initiate growth of cashmere fibre before normal time. Real-time reverse transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (real-time PCR) was used to determine the MD gene mRNA expression levels of skin. The results show that the MT concentration was significant differences after administration from July to November the cashmere fibre growth rate was markedly greater in group of MT implant (M group) than that of the group of control (C group) in July (p 0. 05) in the monthly. These results suggest that the expression levels of MDII mRNA may be involved in the process of cashmere growth, it expression may have a specific signaling pathway in <b>cashmere</b> <b>goats</b> skin, especially in the initiation of cashmere fibre growth period...|$|R
