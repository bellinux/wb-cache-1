5|$|The use of melisma, {{a gospel}} {{tradition}} adapted by vocalists Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey {{would become a}} <b>cornerstone</b> <b>of</b> contemporary R singers {{beginning in the late}} 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Hip hop came to influence contemporary R later in the 1980s, first through new jack swing and then in a related series of subgenres called hip hop soul and neo soul. Hip hop soul and neo soul developed later, in the 1990s. Typified by the work of Mary J. Blige and R. Kelly, the former is a mixture of contemporary R with hip hop beats, while the images and themes of gangsta rap may be present. The latter is a more experimental, edgier, and generally less mainstream combination of 1960s and 1970s-style soul vocals with some hip hop influence, and has earned some mainstream recognition through the work of D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, and Lauryn Hill. D'Angelo's critically acclaimed album Voodoo (2000) has been recognized by music writers as a masterpiece and the <b>cornerstone</b> <b>of</b> the neo soul genre.|$|E

5|$|Al-Mu'tasim's reign {{was also}} marked by {{continuous}} warfare. His generals {{led the fight}} against internal rebellions. The two major internal campaigns of the reign were against the long-running Khurramite uprising of Babak Khorramdin in Adharbayjan, which was suppressed by al-Afshin in 835–837, and against Mazyar, the autonomous ruler of Tabaristan, who had clashed with the Tahirids and risen up in revolt. Al-Mu'tasim himself led a major campaign in 838 against the Byzantine Empire, with his armies defeating Emperor Theophilos and sacking the city of Amorium. The Amorium campaign was widely celebrated, and became a <b>cornerstone</b> <b>of</b> caliphal propaganda, cementing al-Mu'tasim's reputation as a warrior-caliph.|$|E

It was originally composed of four schools—Agriculture, Engineering, Home Economics, and Liberal Arts.|$|E

This expansion saw the construction of a massive public hospital, the Hospital das Clínicas (HC), which began serving the public in 1979.|$|E
