40|$|Abstract Background The {{development}} of new anti-migraine treatments {{is limited by the}} difficulty inassessing migraine pain in laboratory animals. Depression of activity {{is one of the few}} diagnostic criteria formigraine that can be mimicked in rats. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis thatdepression of home <b>cage</b> <b>wheel</b> running is a reliable and clinically relevant method to assess migraine painin rats. Methods Adult female rats were implanted with a cannula to inject allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) onto the dura to induce migraine pain, as has been shown before. Rats recovered from implantation surgery for 8 days in cages containing a running wheel. Home <b>cage</b> <b>wheel</b> running was recorded 23 h a day. AITC and the migraine medication sumatriptan were administered in the hour prior to onset of the dark phase. Results Administration of AITC caused a concentration-dependent decrease in wheel running that lasted 3 h. The duration and magnitude of AITC-induced depression of wheel running was consistent following three repeated injections spaced 48 h apart. Administration of sumatriptan attenuated AITC-induced depressionof wheel running when a large dose (1 mg/kg) was administered immediately following AITC administration. Wheel running patterns did not change when sumatriptan was given to na rats.

40|$|Cardiovascular diseases, {{especially}} the myocardial infarction, {{are the major}} {{cause of death in}} industrialized countries. Incidence and mortality show obvious gender-differences. Until menopause, women rarely have myocardial infarctions and mortality is also low. Postmeno-pausal however, the risk adapts quite fast and incidence and mortality rise. The reasons for the higher mortality in males are at least in the mouse model more fatal cardiac adaptations in extracellular matrix remodeling. Male mice show a more pronounced lycocyte migration and collagen degradation, which is jointly responsible for the higher rate of cardiac rupture. Of great influence are the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and their endogen inhibitors the Tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP), respectively their imbalance. An exaggerated matrix/collagen degradation promotes the risk for ventricular rupture and advances dilatation, while an augmented collagen accumulation increases myocardial stiffness and leads to a restricted pumpfunction. The protective role of exercise prior to or after myocardial infarction has been described previously. The mechanisms, though, have not been fully understood. The present study was done as a foundation for a model investigating the gender-differences in terms of the protective effects a moderate exercise program has on cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction. The gender-differences concerning this matter have not been investigated in the animal model before. To gain basic knowledge, a model of myocardial infarction and one of voluntary <b>cage</b> <b>wheel</b> running was studied. In the model of myocardial infarction mortality and left ventricular rupture rate were higher in males. They also showed a more restricted myocardial compliance in diastole, which caused a more severe loss of cardial pumpfunction. At least in parts the more pronounced fibrosis of the non infarcted areas seems responsible, leading to an augmented cardiac stiffness and greater insufficiency. The higher relative genexpression of procollagen I and III was only significantly higher in male mice when compared to the sexmatched control group. This was the first study to show that in the mouse-model 14 days post-infarction the relative genex-pression of MMP- 9 had returned to baseline and that MMP- 2 was still elevated. Apart from MMP- 9 and TIMP- 4, all other genes were markedly higher after myocardial infarction. The mRNA-expressionlevels of all measured genes after the infarction were almost exactly alike between the two sexes. The voluntary <b>cage</b> <b>wheel</b> running was chosen as an exercise model, because it is a stress-less alternative to commonly used treadmill and swimming models. Besides it is known, that voluntary and involuntary trainingmodels regulate a different set of genes. In the model of voluntary <b>cage</b> <b>wheel</b> running, female mice showed a higher activity and more pronounced cardiac hypertrophy for every kilometer they ran. A greater hypertrophy reserve is discussed. While the body weight of the female running mice increased mostly over the training period, trained males had a significantly lower body weight and higher heartrate than their sedentary controls. One can proceed from the assumption that this is a symptom of greater stress male mice have shown to suffer during isolated housing. They react in a character-istically hyperactive way, leading to restlessness and an increased consumption of energy. The relative expressions of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling indicate a sexspecific, training-dependent mRNA-expression especially of procollagen III, MMP- 2 and TIMP- 1. Of all changes only the higher TIMP- 1 Level in males was significant. It seems that exerciseduration and intensity were too low for these tendencies to reach significance...|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) increases in post-menopausal women, yet, the role of exercise, as a preventative measure for CVD risk in post-menopausal women has not been adequately studied. Accordingly, we investigated the impact of voluntary cage-wheel exercise and forced treadmill exercise on cardiac adaptation in menopausal mice. The most commonly used inducible model for mimicking menopause in women is the ovariectomized (OVX) rodent. However, the OVX model has a few dissimilarities from menopause in humans. In this study, we administered 4 -vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) to female mice, which accelerates ovarian failure as an alternative menopause model to study the impact of exercise in menopausal mice. VCD selectively accelerates the loss of primary and primordial follicles resulting in an endocrine state that closely mimics the natural progression from pre- to peri- to post-menopause in humans. To determine the impact of exercise on exercise capacity and cardiac adaptation in VCD-treated female mice, two methods were used. First, we exposed a group of VCD-treated and untreated mice to a voluntary <b>cage</b> <b>wheel.</b> Second, we used forced treadmill exercise to determine exercise capacity in a separate group VCD-treated and untreated mice measured as a tolerance to exercise intensity and endurance...|$|E

When {{given access to}} a <b>cage</b> <b>wheel,</b> desmin null mice spent less time running and ran less far than wild type mice. Wild type mice showed a significant training effect with prolonged voluntary wheel running, as evidenced {{by an increase in}} mean running speed across the 3 -week exercise period, while desmin null mice did not. Desmin null mice also performed less well in acute treadmill stress and endurance tests compared to wild type mice. We also evaluated serum creatine kinase (CK) activity in wild type and desmin null mice in response to running. Voluntary running did not result in elevated CK activity in either wild type or desmin null mice, while downhill treadmill running caused significant increases in serum CK activity in both wild type and desmin null mice. However, the increase in serum CK was significantly less in desmin null mice than in wild-type mice. These results suggest that the lack of desmin adversely affects the ability of mice to engage in both chronic and acute bouts of endurance running exercise, but that this decrement in performance is not associated with an increase in serum CK activity. 3 INTRODUCTIO...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{the most}} common form of sudden death in young competitive athletes. However, exercise has also been shown to be beneficial in the setting of other cardiac diseases. We examined the ability of voluntary exercise to prevent or reverse the phenotypes of a murine model of HCM harboring a mutant myosin heavy chain (MyHC). No differences in voluntary <b>cage</b> <b>wheel</b> performance between nontransgenic (NTG) and HCM male mice were seen. Exercise prevented fibrosis, myocyte disarray, and induction of “hypertrophic ” markers including NFAT activity when initiated before established HCM pathology. If initiated in older HCM animals with documented disease, exercise reversed myocyte disarray (but not fibrosis) and “hypertrophic ” marker induction. In addition, exercise returned the increased levels of phosphorylated GSK- 3 to those of NTG and decreased levels of phosphorylated CREB in HCM mice to normal levels. Exercise in HCM mice also favorably impacted components of the apoptotic signaling pathway, including Bcl- 2 (an inhibitor of apoptosis) and procaspase- 9 (an effector of apoptosis) expression, and caspase- 3 activity. Remarkably, there were no differences in mortality between exercised NTG and HCM mice. Thus, not only was exercise not harmful but also it was able to prevent and even reverse established cardiac disease phenotypes in this HCM model. (Circ Res. 2006; 98 : 0 - 0.)

The right ventricle (RV) is genetically different from the left ventricle (LV), but it is unknown as to whether this has consequences for the cellular responses to abnormal loading conditions. In the LV, calcineurin-activation is {{a major determinant of}} pathological hypertrophy and an important target for therapeutic strategies. We studied the functional and molecular adaptation of the RV in mouse models of pressure and volume load, focusing on calcineurin-activation. Methods and results Mice were subjected to pulmonary artery banding (PAB), aorto-caval shunt (Shunt), or sham surgery (Control). Four weeks later, mice were functionally evaluated with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, pressure measurements, and voluntary <b>cage</b> <b>wheel</b> exercise. Right ventricular hypertrophy and calcineurin-activation were assessed after sacrifice. Mice with increased pressure load (PAB) or volume load (Shunt) of the RV developed similar degrees of hypertrophy, yet revealed different functional and molecular adaptation. Pulmonary artery banding increased expression of Modulatory-Calcineurin-Interacting-Protein 1 (MCIP 1), indicating calcineurin-activation, and the ratio of beta/alpha-Myosin Heavy Chain (MHC). In addition, PAB reduced exercise capacity and induced moderate RV dilatation with normal RV output at rest. In contrast, Shunt did not increase MCIP 1 expression, and only moderately increased beta/ alpha-MHC ratio. Shunt did not affect exercise capacity, but increased RV volumes and output at rest. Conclusions Pressure and volume load induced different functional and molecular adaptations in the RV.

40|$|Premenopausal women {{appear to}} have a lower {{incidence}} of myocardial infarction (MI) and reduced mortality compared with age-matched men. Clinical studies suggest a protective effect of the female sex hormone Estradiol during the development of pathological hypertrophy. Furthermore it is known that exercise positively influences the outcome of cardiovascular disease, which is more pronounced in females than males. To better understand the shown sex differences and underlying mechanisms, this study analysed the development of physiological and pathological hypertrophy in male and female mice, induced by voluntary <b>cage</b> <b>wheel</b> running (VCWR) and myocardial infarction (MI). Morphological and functional changes of the left ventricle (LV) were estimate using echocardiography. We attempted to determine whether VCWR increases capillary density more in females than in males and whether capillary density post-MI remains higher in females compared to males. Furthermore, we obtained whether VCWR and MI led to an increase in the expression of hypertrophy markers in a sex-dependent manner. VCWR showed a significantly higher running performance and more pronounced hypertrophy in female mice compared to male mice. LV function was unchanged in females, but significantly decreased Ejection Fraction (EF) in males. Gene expression of pathological hypertrophy markers was not increased, but females showed a decreased expression of ANP and β-MHC. Capillary density did not change in both sexes. MI induced a higher mortality in males compared to female mice. Despite the same infarct size females developed more hypertrophy and were able to sustain LV function. In contrast males had a poorer LV function, because of significantly decreased Fractional Area Change, EF and Cardiac Output. In both sexes ANP, BNP, α-skeletal Actin and β-MHC gene expression was significantly increased, indicating the development of pathological hypertrophy. Capillary density was decreased in both sexes. In conclusion, female mice developed a more pronounced physiological hypertrophy after VCWR and were able to compensate wall stress in a better way compared to male mice. After MI capillary density was reduced in both sexes, but only males sustained poorer LV function. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, further studies have to be carried out...|$|E

Thus, voluntary running in ARKO mice was able to reduce cancellous bone resorption, suggesting that sustained exercise may potentially compensate the effects of androgen disruption on cancellous bone.

Preventive sildenafil treatment {{has been shown to}} enhance systolic RV function and improve exercise capacity in a model of fixed RV pressure load. However, it is unknown whether sildenafil has beneficial effects when treatment is started in established RV dysfunction, which is clinically more relevant. Our aim was to assess the effects of sildenafil treatment on RV function and fibrosis in a model of established RV dysfunction due to fixed afterload. Rats were subjected to pulmonary artery banding (PAB), which induced RV dysfunction after 4 wk, characterized by reduced exercise capacity, decreased tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, and RV dilatation. From week 4 onward, 50 % of rats were treated with sildenafil (100 mg. kg(- 1). day(- 1), n = 9; PAB-SIL group) or vehicle (n = 9; PAB-VEH group). At 8 wk, exercise capacity was assessed using <b>cage</b> <b>wheels,</b> and RV function was assessed using invasive RV pressure-volume measurements under anesthesia. Sildenafil treatment, compared with vehicle, improved RV ejection fraction (44 +/- 2 % vs. 34 +/- 2 %, P < 0. 05, PAB-SIL vs. PAB-VEH groups), reduced RV end-diastolic pressure (2. 3 +/- 0. 5 vs. 5. 1 +/- 0. 9 mmHg, P < 0. 05), and RV dilatation (end-systolic volume: 468 +/- 45 vs. 643 +/- 71 mu l, P = 0. 05). Sildenafil treatment also attenuated RV fibrosis (30 +/- 6 vs. 17 +/- 3 %, P < 0. 05) but did not affect end-systolic elastance, exercise capacity, or PKG or PKA activity.

This {{does not mean that}} I do not {{entertain}} the possibility of a companionate relationship between dog and human, or that I cannot see the possible value to each in such a relationship, but four children seemed more than enough to cope with. My children were given as great a measure of freedom and choice as could be afforded them without danger to themselves - a difficult line to determine and tread. When they begged for a pet, I eventually capitulated and two mice were purchased, with run and <b>cage</b> and <b>wheel,</b> and with the assurance that they were both female. I felt uncomfortable, but told myself there would be benefits to my children (I had my doubts about the mice) in learning to care and take responsibility for the care of another being. Given my abhorrence of caging, the mice were given plenty of 2 ̆ 7 controlled 2 ̆ 7 rein/reign in the house which seemed to work okay - okay that was until the baby mice came along.

500|$|Spears {{performed}} [...] "3" [...] as {{the third}} song on her Las Vegas residency, [...] {{as part of the}} original setlist. After a brief talk with the audience, the singer began a performance of the song, jumping into a triangular <b>cage</b> which was <b>wheeled</b> around by her dancers across the stage. A parallel bar then dropped out of the ceiling, and Spears performed [...] choreography similar to the choreography in song's music video. For Billboards Keith Caulfield, the song [...] "served as the sexiest jungle gym in Vegas, as Spears and her dancers undulated their way across and around the bar". Girls' Generation member Sunny performed a cover version of the song during the Girls' Generation Tour that took place in 2011 and 2012. A studio version was also released online alongside the live version featuring on the tour album.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of two jets {{connected}} to sound abatement devices, ca. 1960. At center, two U. S. Air Force jets {{can be seen}} {{connected to}} two large cylindrical vats. Both jets have their wings slightly retracted and hoods lifted. Additionally, the cockpit covering is open on both revealing {{the interior of the}} jet. Several ladders can be seen next to the planes, and a large <b>wheeled</b> <b>cage</b> stands in front of each plane. A large cylindrical vat is visible behind each of the jets. The vat has a small hole in its front where the engine of the plane appears to be inserted. Large pipes can be seen extending from the top of these vats. In the background, a series of lights and cylindrical towers can be seen. A description on the photoprint reads: "Jet aircraft sound abatement devices. North American Aviation, Incorporated. El Segundo, California"...|$|R
