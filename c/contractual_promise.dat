[...] Sotomayor first noted {{that this was not a}} case of first impression, and that the court had ruled on a similar issue only seven years previously. [...] Sotomayor stated that Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. Leavitt held that when the government makes a <b>contractual</b> <b>promise</b> to pay in return for services, the government is bound to pay for those services. [...] This was a long-standing principle of contract law, dating back to Ferris, and the [...] "principle safeguards both the expectations of Government contractors and the long-term fiscal interests of the United States." [...] If the appropriation exceeds the amount of the individual contract, then the government is bound to honor the contract. [...] Sotomayor stated that although the situation that Congress placed the BIA in is frustrating, but it is an issue for Congress to resolve. [...] The Court affirmed the decision of the Tenth Circuit Court. [...] Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Elena Kagan joined Justice Sotomayor's opinion.|$|E

If it did not work, buyers would receive £100 and the company {{said that they had}} deposited £1,000 in the bank to show their good faith. When sued, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer; instead it was [...] "a mere puff", or [...] gimmick. But the court of appeal held that it would appear to a reasonable man that Carbolic had made a serious offer, and determined that the reward was a <b>contractual</b> <b>promise.</b>|$|E

This trend {{is often referred to}} as the “green building” movement and has been fueled not only by customer demand and concern for the environment, but also by the increasing potential cost benefits associated with energy efficiency and the use of sustainable materials. This article describes some general history and background with respect to green building, including attempts to define “green building,” as well as some of the legal issues that often arise in the “green building” arena. These legal issues include: (1) <b>contractual</b> <b>promises</b> or guarantees with respect to the efficacy of energy performance or savings measures; (2) <b>contractual</b> <b>promises</b> or guarantees with respect to certification of buildings under Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) or other rating systems; (3) the veracity of claims by various companies of being “green” despite evidence to the contrary, popularly known as “greenwashing”; and (4) the allocation of risk and other transactional issues with respect to distributed renewable generation, such as rooftop solar panels...|$|R

40|$|In The Myth of Efficient Breach: New Defenses of the Expectation Interest, Daniel Markovits and Alan Schwartz {{argue that}} <b>contractual</b> <b>promises</b> between {{sophisticated}} parties are best interpreted as disjunctive promises to perform or pay damages. They further {{argue that this}} dual performance hypothesis answers moral critics of the expectation remedy. This comment makes three claims about Markovits and Schwartz 2 ̆ 7 s argument. First, although the dual performance hypothesis is supported by Markovits and Schwartz 2 ̆ 7 s instrumentalist model, {{they do not have}} a good argument that it is empirically correct [...] that it is the best interpretation of what sophisticated parties actually intend. Such an argument is necessary to fully answer the moral critics. Second, the dual performance hypothesis is still worth taking seriously, as it casts new light on the implications of the theory of efficient breach and the economic model that stands behind it. In particular, the hypothesis helps explain why punitive damages can make sense when breaching parties attempt to evade their obligation to pay damages. Finally, the dual performance hypothesis is not the best answer to moral critics of expectation damages. Rather than reinterpreting the content of <b>contractual</b> <b>promises,</b> we should reject the premise that parties 2 ̆ 7 moral obligations are best understood on the model of promises. We should also reject the assumption that contract law serves morality only if it enforces parties 2 ̆ 7 first-order moral obligations.

40|$|We {{consider}} a hyperbolic discounting individual {{who has the}} ability to make promises which are costly to break. We first identify conditions under which promises made are kept, and conditions under which they are (partially) broken. Second, we provide microeconomic foundations for the effectiveness of <b>contractual</b> <b>promises.</b> Specifically, we show how the cost of breaking promises can be reinterpreted in terms of either a reputation loss in the presence of incomplete information or a financial loss under monitoring and explicit contracting. The results imply that strategic interactions between hyperbolic discounting individuals may serve as a commitment mechanism against intrapersonal conflicts. © Journal compilation © 2008 by the Royal Economic Society.

In California, [...] "an insurer, who wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy limits is liable for the entire judgment against the insured even if it exceeds the policy limits."

5000|$|In their {{decision}} in Makdessi the Supreme Court reviewed the historical {{origins of the}} rule against penalty clauses in contracts. [...] The law originated {{in the fifteenth century}} in relation to [...] "defeasible bonds" [...] (sometimes called penal bonds) which were a <b>contractual</b> <b>promise</b> to pay money, which might be discharged if certain obligations were performed (and if the obligations were not performed, then the payment terms under the bond could be enforced). [...] However the courts of equity regarded these as what they really were - security for performance of the underlying obligation - and were prepared to restrain enforcement of such bonds where the defaulting party paid any damages due at common law. [...] In time the courts of common law began to mirror this approach and stay any proceedings on such bonds where the defendant gave an undertaking to pay damages together with interest and costs. The position of the common law courts was adopted and codified in the Administration of Justice Act 1696 and later the Administration of Justice Act 1705. Accordingly, procedurally relief in relation to such bonds was thereafter administered entirely by the common law courts without intervention by the courts of equity. However, the courts of equity began to develop concurrent remedies for relief from forfeiture. With the decline of the use of defeasible bonds the procedural mechanics became increasingly applied to liquidated damages clauses.|$|E

5000|$|At {{common law}} not all {{promises}} were enforceable.

A promise made under seal was enforceable under the old action on the covenant, which has developed into the modern law in relation to deeds. [...] Promises may now also be enforceable as negligent mis-statement, promissory estoppel, misleading or deceptive conduct in breach of the Australian Consumer Law. In Australia, the law of equity has also played an increasing part in changing the laws regarding contracts, and the remedies that may be available when <b>contractual</b> <b>promises</b> are breached.|$|R

The owner of a Slock can set a deposit amount and a price for renting his property, and a customer can pay the deposit through a transaction to the Ethereum blockchain to get permission to open and close the Slock. With Slock.it, locks are controlled by automatically executing business contracts in the blockchain, and businesses such as renting Airbnb apartments can become fully automated.|$|R
