25|$|Addressing is {{generally}} done by hand, {{and is an}} opportunity to demonstrate one's handwriting (see shodō). The postcards may have spaces for the sender to write a personal message. Blank cards are available, so people can hand-write or draw their own. Rubber stamps with conventional messages and with the annual animal are on sale at department stores and other outlets, and many people buy ink brushes for personal greetings. Special printing devices are popular, especially among people who practice crafts. Software also lets artists create their own designs and output them using their computer's <b>color</b> <b>printer.</b> Because a gregarious individual might have hundreds to write, print shops offer a wide variety of sample postcards with short messages so that the sender has only to write addresses. Even with the rise in popularity of email, the nengajō remains very popular in Japan, although the younger generation hardly send any cards, preferring to exchange digital greetings using their mobile phones. In recent years this digital greeting preference is gradually accepted among the society.|$|E

40|$|<b>Color</b> laser <b>printers</b> have fast {{printing}} {{speed and}} high resolution, and forgeries using <b>color</b> laser <b>printers</b> can cause significant harm to society. A source printer identification technique {{can be employed}} as a countermeasure to those forgeries. This paper presents a <b>color</b> laser <b>printer</b> identification method based on cascaded learning of deep neural networks. The refiner network is trained by adversarial training to refine the synthetic dataset for halftone color decomposition. The halftone color decomposing ConvNet is trained with the refined dataset, and the trained knowledge is transferred to the printer identifying ConvNet to enhance the accuracy. The robustness about rotation and scaling is considered in training process, which is not considered in existing methods. Experiments are performed on eight <b>color</b> laser <b>printers,</b> and the performance is compared with several existing methods. The experimental results clearly show that the proposed method outperforms existing source <b>color</b> laser <b>printer</b> identification methods.
