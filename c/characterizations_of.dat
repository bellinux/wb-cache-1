Although the topic was dealt {{with much more}} openly than in the decades that followed, the <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> gay and lesbian {{characters}} were usually derogatory.

The Jaws film, released in June 1975, omitted many of the novel's minor subplots, focusing more on the shark and the <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> the three protagonists.

5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Griffiths {{focused on the}} {{inconsistent}} portrayal of Horus and Set as brothers and as uncle and nephew. He argued that, {{in the early stages}} of Egyptian mythology, the struggle between Horus and Set as siblings and equals was originally separate from the murder of Osiris. The two stories were joined into the single Osiris myth sometime before the writing of the Pyramid Texts. With this merging, the genealogy of the deities involved and the characterization of the Horus–Set conflict were altered so that Horus is the son and heir avenging Osiris's death. Traces of the independent traditions remained in the conflicting <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> the combatants' relationship and in texts unrelated to the Osiris myth, which make Horus the son of the goddess Nut or the goddess Hathor rather than of Isis and Osiris. Griffiths therefore rejected the possibility that Osiris's murder was rooted in historical events. This hypothesis has been accepted by more recent scholars such as Jan Assmann and George Hart.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the initial}} <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> tsunami {{earthquakes}} came from seismologist Hiroo Kanamori in the early 1970s, and additional clarity materialized following the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake and tsunami, which was evaluated to have a surface wave magnitude of 7.0 when analyzing short period seismic signals. When longer period signals of around 250 seconds were investigated, the shock was reevaluated to have a moment magnitude of 7.6, with a hypothesis that the slow nature of the slip of the event may have concealed its substantial extent. Sediment was thought to have contributed to a slower rupture, due to a lubrication effect at the plate interface, with the result being an earthquake signature that had abundant long period seismic signals, which could {{be an important factor}} in the tsunami-generation process.|$|E
5|$|The race {{began in}} November 1998 when four-term {{incumbent}} New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement. Both the Democratic Party and Republican Party sought high-profile candidates {{to compete for}} the open seat. By early 1999 Clinton and Mayor of New York City Rudolph Giuliani were the likely respective nominees. Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, purchased a house in Chappaqua, New York, in September 1999; she thereby became eligible for the election, although she faced <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> carpetbagging since she had never resided in the state before. The lead in statewide polls swung from Clinton to Giuliani and back to Clinton as the campaigns featured both successful strategies and mistakes as well as dealing with current events. In late April and May 2000, Giuliani's medical, romantic, marital, and political lives all collided in a tumultuous four-week period, culminating in his withdrawing from the race on May 19.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's next {{published}} work was the 1967 novel, The Vendor of Sweets. It was inspired {{in part by}} his American visits and consists of extreme <b>characterizations</b> <b>of</b> both the Indian and American stereotypes, drawing on the many cultural differences. However, while it displays his characteristic comedy and narrative, the book was reviewed as lacking in depth. This year, Narayan travelled to England, where he received {{the first of his}} honorary doctorates from the University of Leeds. The next few years were a quiet period for him. He published his next book, a collection of short stories, A Horse and Two Goats, in 1970. Meanwhile, Narayan remembered a promise made to his dying uncle in 1938, and started translating the Kamba Ramayanam to English. The Ramayana was published in 1973, after five years of work. Almost immediately after publishing The Ramayana, Narayan started working on a condensed translation of the Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharata. While he was researching and writing the epic, he also published another book, The Painter of Signs (1977). The Painter of Signs is a bit longer than a novella and makes a marked change from Narayan's other works, as he deals with hitherto unaddressed subjects such as sex, although the development of the protagonist's character is very similar to his earlier creations. The Mahabharata was published in 1978.|$|E

40|$|Background: Different {{methods have}} been used for <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> Leishmania promastigotes. Monoclonal {{antibodies}} are useful in <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> Leishmania spp. both amastogotes and promastigotes. Objective: Comparing the <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> Leishmania spp. promastigotes with immunoperoxidase test (Avidin-Biotin) tech-niques and an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA). Methods: Application of specific monoclonal antibodies for <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> different Leishmania species. Immunoperoxidase tests (Avidin-Biotin) and indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) were employed for <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> different Leishmnia promastigotes from culture. Five monoclonal antibodies including LXXVIII- 2 E 5 - A 8 (D 2) specific for L. donovani:L. infantum, IS 2 - 2 B 4 (A 11) specific for L. tropica, XCIV-H 2 - AB (T 10) specific for L. tropica, XLVI- 5 B 8 - B 3 (T 1) specific for L. major, and T 7 reactive to both L. major and L. tropica as well as an anti GP 63 mAb were used. Results: The best result was obtained with the dilution of 1 : 50 for both mAb and conjugate. One hundred percent sensitivity and specificity was achieved for <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> Leishmania promastogotes with both methods. Conclusion: As immunoperoxidase method needs less equipments compared to IFA technique, it would be a preferred method for <b>characterization</b> <b>of</b> promastigotes...|$|R
