5000|$|In 1559 a {{paper mill}} was {{established}} at Wattens, {{the first in}} the Austrian lands. The local economy was further promoted, when in 1895 Daniel Swarovski (1862-1956), a <b>glass</b> <b>cutter</b> from Jiřetín pod Bukovou in Bohemia, settled here to start the production of crystal jewelry. Wattens received market rights in 1895.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>glass</b> <b>cutter</b> may use {{a diamond}} {{to create the}} split, but more {{commonly}} a small cutting wheel made of hardened steel or tungsten carbide 4-6 mm in diameter with a V-shaped profile called a [...] "hone angle" [...] is used. The greater the hone angle of the wheel, the sharper {{the angle of the}} V and the thicker the piece of glass it is designed to cut. The hone angle on most hand-held <b>glass</b> <b>cutters</b> is 120°, though wheels are made as sharp as 154° for cutting glass as thick as 0.5 in. [...] Their main drawback is that wheels with sharper hone angles will become dull more quickly than their more obtuse counterparts. The effective cutting of glass also requires a small amount of oil (kerosene is often used) and some <b>glass</b> <b>cutters</b> contain a reservoir of this oil which both lubricates the wheel and prevents it from becoming too hot: as the wheel scores, friction between it and the glass surface briefly generates intense heat, and oil dissipates this efficiently. When properly lubricated a steel wheel can give a long period of satisfactory service. However, tungsten carbide wheels have been proven to have a significantly longer life than steel wheels and offer greater and more reproducible penetration in scoring as well as easier opening of the scored glass.|$|R

50|$|A <b>glass</b> <b>cutter</b> {{is a tool}} used to make {{a shallow}} score in one surface of a piece of glass that is to be broken in two pieces. The scoring makes a split in the surface of the glass which {{encourages}} the glass to break along the score. Regular, annealed glass can be broken apart this way but not tempered glass as the latter tends to shatter rather than breaking cleanly into two pieces.|$|R

40|$|The Diploma thesis "Silesian Baroque Cut Glass in the {{collection}} of Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague" deals with {{the collection}} of Silesian Baroque cut glass at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague spanning from {{the last quarter of the}} 17 th century to the third quarter of the 18 th century. The thesis describes the technique of glass cutting and its history. It also deals with the beginnings of glass cutting in Silesia, which are associated with the Schaffgotsch family in the Hirschberger Valley. Worth mentioning is also the renowned <b>glass</b> <b>cutter</b> Friedrich Winter, who along with his glass workshop substantially influenced Silesian glass cutting in the following decades. The thesis also mentiones other well-known <b>glass</b> <b>cutters,</b> particularly Christian Gottfried Schneider. The chapters dealing with the development of the shape and ornament of Silesian Baroque cut glass are important for correct classification by periods and localities. A catalogue of selected objects from the collection of the Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague follows the first part of the thesis which comprises the text. Most of the catalogue's objects have not been published thus far or were often never presented in detail if they appeared in literature...|$|R
50|$|Although modifying glass tubing is {{no longer}} an {{essential}} laboratory technique, many are still familiar with the basic methods. A <b>glass</b> <b>cutter</b> is used to break pieces of glass tubing into smaller pieces. Freshly cut edges are flame polished before use to remove the rough edge. Glass tubing can be bent by heating evenly over a Bunsen flame to red heat. Hose barbs can be added to tubing, giving a better grip and seal for attaching plastic or rubber tubing.|$|R

He followed with {{studies at the}} Secondary School of Glassmaking in Kamenický Šenov, the oldest glass school in the world (founded 1856). From 1971-72 he was head master at the Bohemia Glassworks school, followed by three years as a <b>glass</b> <b>cutter</b> at the Co-op Výtvarná řemesla in Prague. From 1975-81 Janák studied at the Academy of Applied Arts in Prague under Prof. Stanislav Libenský.|$|R

50|$|Mechanization, the {{movement}} away from glass containers, and {{the movement}} of manufacturing to emerging nations with cheaper labor costs led many unions in the ceramics, glass, and pottery industries to rapidly lose members. The AFL-CIO established a Stone, Glass and Clay Coordinating Committee to coordinate the collective bargaining activities of these shrinking unions and strengthen their activities in this area. The coordinating committee also encouraged union mergers. This latter effort had some success. In 1975, the former Glass Bottle Blowers Association (GBBA) merged with the Window <b>Glass</b> <b>Cutters</b> League.|$|R

As a young man, Joseph Mougin studied art, but was also fascinated by horticulture and several forms of science, which gave him a natural sensitivity to what would become the main inspiration themes of the Art Nouveau movement. His brother Pierre, a great Sarah Bernardt admirer, gave up acting classes to embrace a career as a ceramist with his elder brother.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>cutters</b> are {{manufactured}} with wheels of varying diameters. [...] One {{of the most}} popular has a diameter of 5.5 mm ( [...] in). The ratio between the arc of the wheel and the pressure applied with the tool has an important bearing on the degree of penetration. Average hand pressure with this size wheel often gives good results. For a duller wheel on soft glass a larger wheel (e.g., 6 mm ( [...] in) will require no change in hand pressure. A smaller wheel (3 mm ( [...] in)) is appropriate for cutting patterns and curves since a smaller wheel can follow curved lines without dragging.|$|R
50|$|Klaus Moje {{was born}} in 1936 in Germany to a family of glass workers who {{specialised}} in providing bevelled and decorated glass for things such as mirrors and shelving. Moje became a journeyman <b>glass</b> <b>cutter</b> and worked in his family's shop until he received a scholarship to study glass art in Rheinbach and then in Hadamar. After a brief time as a German folk singer, Moje opened a stained glass studio with Isgard Moje-Wohlgemuth. Moje made his first entry into the glass art world with carved and polished glass sculptures. Although these pieces garnered him {{quite a bit of}} attention, he abandoned the cut glass work when he discovered a caché of colourful glass canes that were used to make buttons for the garment industry.|$|R
