In a battery, an electrochemical potential arising from the movement of ions balances the reaction energy of the electrodes. The maximum voltage that a battery reaction can produce is sometimes called the standard electrochemical potential of that reaction (see also Electrode potential and Table of standard electrode potentials).

50|$|A <b>concentration</b> <b>cell</b> generates {{electricity}} from {{the reduction in}} the thermodynamic free energy of the electrochemical system as the difference in the chemical concentrations in the two half-cells is reduced.

The energy is generated from thermal energy that the cell absorbs as heat, as the electricity flows. This generation of {{electricity from}} ambient thermal energy, without a temperature gradient, is possible because the convergence of the chemical concentrations in the two half-cells increases entropy, and this increase more than compensates for the entropy decrease when heat is converted into electrical energy.|$|E

5000|$|A thermo{{galvanic}} cell {{is a kind}} of {{galvanic cell}} in which heat is employed to provide electrical power directly. These cells are electrochemical cells in which the two electrodes are deliberately maintained at different temperatures. This temperature difference generates a potential difference between the electrodes. The electrodes can be of identical composition and the electrolyte solution homogeneous. This is usually the case in these cells. This is in contrast to galvanic cells in which electrodes and/or solutions of different composition provide the electromotive potential. As long as there is a difference in temperature between the electrodes a current will flow through the circuit. A thermogalvanic cell can be seen as analogous to a <b>concentration</b> <b>cell</b> but instead of running on differences in the concentration/pressure of the reactants they make use of differences in the [...] "concentrations" [...] of thermal energy. The principal application of thermogalvanic cells is the production of electricity from low-temperature heat sources (waste heat and solar heat). Their energetic efficiency is low, in the range of 0.1% to 1% for conversion of heat into electricity.|$|E

50|$|This device {{accepts a}} heat input {{in a range}} 900-1300 K and {{produces}} direct current with predicted device efficiencies of 15-40%. In the AMTEC, sodium is driven around a closed thermodynamic cycle between a high-temperature heat reservoir and a cooler reservoir at the heat rejection temperature. The unique feature of the AMTEC cycle is that sodium ion conduction between a high-pressure or -activity region and a low-pressure or -activity region {{on either side of}} a highly ionically conducting refractory solid electrolyte is thermodynamically nearly equivalent to an isothermal expansion of sodium vapor between the same high and low pressures. Electrochemical oxidation of neutral sodium at the anode leads to sodium ions, which traverse the solid electrolyte, and electrons, which travel from the anode through an external circuit, where they perform electrical work, to the low-pressure cathode, where they recombine with the ions to produce low-pressure sodium gas. The sodium gas generated at the cathode then travels to a condenser at the heat-rejection temperature of perhaps 400-700 K, where liquid sodium reforms. The AMTEC thus is an electrochemical <b>concentration</b> <b>cell,</b> which converts the work generated by expansion of sodium vapor directly into electric power.|$|E
