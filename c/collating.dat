5|$|Scrivener have {{rendered}} {{great service}} {{in the way of}} <b>collating</b> manuscripts, (...) as well as Gregory in Germany has also catalogued them.|$|E
5|$|By 2009, the commission's work of <b>collating</b> declassified U.S. {{military}} documents with survivors' accounts confirmed eight representative {{cases of}} what it found were wrongful U.S. killings of hundreds of South Korean civilians, including refugees crowded into a cave attacked with napalm bombs, and those at a shoreline refugee encampment deliberately shelled by a U.S. warship.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to domestic surveillance, the 610 Office is allegedly involved in foreign intelligence. Hao Fengjun, the former 610 officer-turned defector from Tianjin, testified that {{his job at}} the 610 Office involved <b>collating</b> and analyzing intelligence reports on overseas Falun Gong populations, including in the United States, Canada and Australia.|$|E
50|$|It was {{examined}} by Joseph Dobrovsky, who <b>collated</b> {{some of its}} readings for Johann Jakob Griesbach. Scholz <b>collated</b> it, but with very little exactness. Tischendorf <b>collated</b> its text in 1844 and Tregelles in 1846. Burgon examined the manuscript in 1872.|$|R
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was examined}} and slightly <b>collated</b> by Birch and Scholz. Antonio Maria Biscioni published its facsimile in 1752. Hoskier <b>collated</b> {{text of the}} Apocalypse.|$|R
5000|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was added}} to the list of New Testament manuscripts by Scrivener, who it examined and <b>collated.</b> Scrivener described and <b>collated</b> its text in 1852.|$|R
5|$|Much of the wordplay in {{the book}} stems {{from the use of}} {{multilingual}} puns which draw {{on a wide range of}} languages. The role played by Beckett and other assistants included <b>collating</b> words from these languages on cards for Joyce to use and, as Joyce's eyesight worsened, of writing the text from the author's dictation.|$|E
5|$|Robert FitzRoy was {{appointed}} in 1854 {{as chief of}} a new department within the Board of Trade {{to deal with the}} collection of weather data at sea as a service to mariners. This was the forerunner of the modern Meteorological Office. All ship captains were tasked with <b>collating</b> data on the weather and computing it, with the use of tested instruments that were loaned for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Several of the anecdotes he amassed were {{published}} in magazines and, just before his death, work began on <b>collating</b> {{the first of four}} compendiums of the tales; three {{were published}} a few years after his death. He was fluent in several languages, including Scottish Gaelic, and transcribed the legends precisely as dictated by the narrators.|$|E
40|$|Felipe Cussen was in trouble. He {{needed help}} {{to correct a}} poem. He sent some friends and acquaintances a desperate call. The three volumes of Correcciones are the result. Volume I <b>collates</b> the Spanish-language {{response}}s. Volume II <b>collates</b> the English-language responses. Volume III <b>collates</b> the visual responses. Scott Weintraubs response is found on page 13 of Volume II...|$|R
50|$|The {{part of the}} {{manuscript}} with {{the text of the}} Apocalypse was described and its text was <b>collated</b> by Scrivener. Herman C. Hoskier <b>collated</b> its text again.|$|R
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was examined}} and <b>collated</b> by J. Farrer of Carlisle in 1804, Scrivener, and C. R. Gregory (1883). Scrivener <b>collated</b> and edited its text in 1852.|$|R
5|$|Working {{alongside}} Gemma whilst {{they were}} producing the globes, Mercator would {{have witnessed the}} process of progressing geography: obtaining previous maps, comparing and <b>collating</b> their content, studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents, merchants, pilgrims, travellers and seamen. He put his newly learned talents {{to work in a}} burst of productivity. In 1537, aged only 25, he established his reputation with a map of the Holy Land which was researched, engraved, printed and partly published by himself.|$|E
5|$|The next {{successful}} ascent {{was made}} on January 29, 1834, 40years later, by the Scottish botanist David Douglas, who also reached the summit caldera using the ʻAinapō Trail. By the time Douglas reached the summit the environment had put him under extreme duress, but he nonetheless stayed overnight to make measurements of the summit caldera's proportions and record barometric data on its height, both now known to be widely inaccurate. Douglas collected biological samples on the way both up and down, and after a difficult and distressing descent began <b>collating</b> his samples; he planned to return to England, but instead several months later his body was mysteriously discovered crushed in a pit besides a dead wild boar.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester is a {{ceremonial}} county {{with its own}} Lord-Lieutenant who is the personal representative of the monarch. The Local Government Act 1972 provided that {{the whole of the}} area to be covered by the new metropolitan county of Greater Manchester would also be included in the Duchy of Lancaster– extending the duchy to include areas which were formerly in the counties of Cheshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Until 31 March 2005, Greater Manchester's Keeper of the Rolls was appointed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; they are now appointed by the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. The first Lord Lieutenant of Greater Manchester was Sir William Downward who held the title from 1974 to 1988. The current Lord Lieutenant is Warren James Smith. As a geographic county, Greater Manchester is used by the government (via the Office for National Statistics) for the gathering of county-wide statistics, and organising and <b>collating</b> general register and census material.|$|E
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was examined}} by Birch, Scholz, Duchesne, Stevenson, and C. R. Gregory (1886). It was slightly <b>collated</b> by Scholz. Hoskier <b>collated</b> {{the text of}} the Apocalypse.|$|R
50|$|It follows, therefore, that legatees {{who are not}} {{obliged to}} <b>collate,</b> and the estate’s {{creditors}} who can recover their debts in the ordinary course, cannot benefit from what is <b>collated.</b>|$|R
50|$|Walker also <b>collated</b> {{a number}} of manuscripts of Archbishop William Wake. Altogether Walker seems to have <b>collated</b> some seventy-eight Greek manuscripts, {{containing}} the whole or parts of the New Testament.|$|R
5|$|HMV's Poll of Polls was {{an annual}} list of albums {{compiled}} by British music retailer HMV from 1998 to 2012. The listing was created each December by <b>collating</b> year-end polls from approximately 30music magazines, newspapers and guides {{to determine the}} most critically acclaimed albums of the year. An album's placing in the list {{was determined by the}} number of different polls in which it was included. In the event of two records featuring in the same number of polls, the album with the highest combined placings was given the higher position on the Poll of Polls. In 2011, Let England Shake by PJ Harvey was named the best album of the year after receiving 21nominations– the following year, Channel Orange by Frank Ocean topped the poll with 22nominations.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the tank the artillery was no longer required to aid the infantry by destroying obstacles and machine gun positions. Instead, the artillery assisted by neutralising the German artillery with Counter battery fire. British Army researchers under Lieutenant William Lawrence Bragg developed sound ranging, a method of determining the location of hostile artillery from the sound of its guns firing. A Counter Battery Staff Officer (CBSO) was appointed at each corps to co-ordinate the counter battery effort, <b>collating</b> reports from sound ranging and Royal Flying Corps observers. By the end of the war, it was realised that the important effect of the barrage was to demoralise and suppress the enemy, rather than physical destruction; a short, intense bombardment immediately followed by an infantry assault was more effective than the weeks of grinding bombardment used in 1916.|$|E

50|$|Someone <b>collated</b> it for Walton. It {{was used}} by John Mill (as Lin. 2). The {{manuscript}} was <b>collated</b> by Orlando T. Dobbin in 1854. C. R. Gregory saw it in 1883.|$|R
5000|$|In Azerbaijani, {{there are}} eight {{additional}} letters to the standard Latin alphabet. Five of them are vowels: i, ı, ö, ü, ə and three are consonants: ç, ş, ğ. The alphabet {{is the same as}} the Turkish alphabet, with the same sounds written with the same letters, except for three additional letters: q, x and ə for sounds that do not exist in Turkish. Although all the [...] "Turkish letters" [...] are <b>collated</b> in their [...] "normal" [...] alphabetical order like in Turkish, the three extra letters are <b>collated</b> arbitrarily after letters whose sounds approach theirs. So, q is <b>collated</b> just after k, x (pronounced like a German ch) is <b>collated</b> just after h and ə (pronounced roughly like an English short a) is <b>collated</b> just after e.|$|R
50|$|Scholz <b>collated</b> {{the entire}} text of five manuscripts: 262, 299, 300, 301 and 346. Other manuscripts he <b>collated</b> in large part: (260, 270, 271, 277, 284, 285, 298, 324, 353, 382 and 428).|$|R
25|$|There are {{two main}} <b>collating</b> {{sequences}} for the Arabic alphabet, abjad and hija.|$|E
25|$|The organising body, by <b>collating</b> {{many such}} reports, can then {{determine}} patterns of bird movements for large populations. Non-ringing/banding scientists can also obtain data {{for use in}} bird-related research.|$|E
25|$|There {{is yet to}} be {{a uniform}} {{standard}} <b>collating</b> sequence (sorting order of graphemes to be used in dictionaries, indices, computer sorting programs, etc.) of Bengali graphemes. Experts in both Bangladesh and India are currently working towards a common solution for the problem.|$|E
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was examined}} by Scholz, who <b>collated</b> it loosely. It was <b>collated</b> again by Tischendorf in 1843 and Tregelles in 1846. In 1850 Tischenforf and Tregelles compared their collations for mutual correction.|$|R
50|$|Collation {{applies only}} to heirs who have adiated. If an {{inheritance}} is repudiated, the heirs who receive the inheritance by accrual {{will be required to}} <b>collate</b> what the repudiating heir would have had to <b>collate.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{described}} by Daniel Gotthilf Moldenhawer, who <b>collated</b> it about 1783 for Andreas Birch. It was also <b>collated</b> by Matthaei. It was briefly described by Emmanuel Miller. Miller deciphered {{the date of the}} colophon as 1292.|$|R
25|$|Topographical Descriptions, Regiments, and Policies is the {{unpublished}} diplomatic {{book that}} he was preparing. Tilney dedicated his work to King James and spoke about <b>collating</b> notes on different countries. This reference work reveals Tilney's knowledge on varied subjects include topography, genealogy, geography, economics and law.|$|E
25|$|By 1972, the Chronicle {{was being}} run by {{biologist}} Sergei Kovalev, mathematician Tatyana Velikanova and linguist Tatyana Khodorovich. Kovalev acted as chief editor, while Velikanova was responsible for <b>collating</b> material and organizing apartments for meetings, with Khodorovich serving as a major conduit for information.|$|E
25|$|Mead’s {{butterfly}} {{knowledge and}} expertise grew {{to such an}} extent that he was given the job of <b>collating</b> the butterfly discoveries from all the Wheeler Survey expeditions in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona from 1871 to 1874 and submitting the results as part of the final report to the United States Government.|$|E
5000|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was written}} in Italy. In 1899 Kirsopp Lake photographed 1 page of it. In 1902 it was thoroughly examined by C. R. Gregory, who partially <b>collated</b> its text. Herman C. Hoskier <b>collated</b> and edited its text in 1929.|$|R
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was examined}} and <b>collated</b> by Scrivener, who published its text in 1852. The manuscript {{was added to}} the list of New Testament manuscripts by Scrivener (571) and Gregory (484). Scrivener <b>collated</b> its text. It was examined by Henri Omont.|$|R
40|$|The <b>COLLATE</b> {{project is}} {{concerned}} with digitised historical material. One of the main features of <b>COLLATE</b> system architecture is the integration of software components that exploit state-of-the-art techniques coming from the area of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation (KR). This work describes the results achieved by applying machine learning methods for automatic classification and labelling of documents. Furthermore, we also discuss the advantages obtained by exploiting brand new research achievements in KR {{for the design of}} <b>COLLATE</b> data model...|$|R
