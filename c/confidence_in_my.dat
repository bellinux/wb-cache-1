I have felt no glow of achievement in any summing up, though none of them have been bad." ...|$|E

He had {{previously}} co-developed the stories for the second season episodes [...] "Colony" [...] and [...] "Anasazi" [...] - both with series creator Chris Carter, and received teleplay credits for the third season episodes [...] "Avatar" [...] and [...] "Talitha Cumi". As The X-Files entered its sixth season, Duchovny {{decided that it was}} an appropriate time to try writing a full episode. Before then, he had felt {{that he did not have}} the skills necessary; he said, [...] "I didn't have the surety, the <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind, that I could write a teleplay...It took me to the sixth year of the show to actually sit down and write one of my ideas." [...] In late 1998, Duchovny met with series creator Carter and they agreed that Duchovny would write a late-season installment for the series.|$|E

[...] "That {{was a time when}} I had lost a little bit of <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> writing. I hadn't had any hits for some time. I felt awful.

As Balderstone later said, [...] "They gave me a bit of stick at first because I wasn't the quickest player or the hardest tackler. I used to think I made up for it with speed of thought and control of the ball. I always had <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ability and I knew there'd be somebody in the crowd who appreciated a bit of skill. I won them over and they were very good to me after that." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{boost to}} McCain's {{campaign}} came on March 25, when former First Lady Nancy Reagan endorsed the Senator {{at her home}} in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California. Reagan released a statement, reading, [...] "John McCain has been a good friend for over thirty years. My husband and I first came to know him as a returning Vietnam War POW, and were impressed by the courage he had shown through his terrible ordeal. I believe John's record and experience have prepared him well to be our next president." [...] Standing with Reagan, McCain said, [...] "This is an important, most important kind of expression of <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ability to lead the party that I could have." [...] McCain's friendship with Nancy Reagan had survived a period of coldness following his divorce from his first wife Carol, whom the Reagans were quite fond of.|$|E
2500|$|Kleist, his units {{reinforced}} by Waffen-SS General Sepp Dietrich's [...] 1st SS Division (the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler), attacked on 17 November, and captured Rostov on the 21st. But the Soviets had {{had time to}} prepare, and launched a counter-offensive on the 25th. On the 28th Rundstedt authorised Kleist to withdraw from Rostov and establish a front on the Mius, 70km to the west. When Hitler heard of this the next day, he ordered that Rostov should be held, although it had in fact already been evacuated. Rundstedt replied by insisting on his decision, and adding: [...] "Should <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> leadership no longer exist, I beg to request someone be substituted who enjoys the necessary confidence of the Supreme Command." [...] Hitler took Rundstedt at his word, and on 1 December he dismissed him, replacing him with Reichenau. The new commander saw at once that Rundstedt was right, and succeeded in persuading Hitler, via Halder, to authorise the withdrawal. This was the first significant defeat the German Army suffered in World War II, and Rundstedt was the first senior commander to be dismissed.|$|E

2500|$|Allen's {{response}} was measured. He requested that any decision on his progress be deferred until a report {{could be made}} by a liaison officer or more senior officer. [...] MacArthur and Blamey continued to press Allen through the delays experienced at Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village. [...] To his credit, Allen stood by his subordinates. Just as the 16th Brigade was advancing on Eora Village, a signal from MacArthur through Blamey on 21 October further pressured Allen: [...] "Operations reports show that progress on the trail is NOT repeat NOT satisfactory. The tactical handling of our troops in my opinion is faulty." [...] Allen replied, in part: [...] "I have complete <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> brigade commanders and troops and feel {{that they could not}} have done better." [...] Allen's trust may have been misplaced though, as Anderson describes Lloyd as having [...] "botched" [...] the tactical handling of the first two days of the engagement at Eora Village that were just then unfolding. He also notes that the downward pressure being applied for haste likely weighed heavily in Lloyd's decision to proceed initially with a frontal attack. [...] The pressure for more haste thereby contributed to increasing the delays. On 28 October, Blamey ordered Allen's recall and replacement by Vasey. Allen had vouched for the judgement [...] and professionalism of his brigade commanders (in this case, specifically Lloyd) and in this, he was ultimately responsible; however, Anderson opines that Allen's replacement may have been inevitable, regardless of the justification.|$|E
2500|$|Stay Alive shows a {{different}} side of Nina, consisting mostly of original songs, and covers {{a wide range}} of genres from piano-driven ballads, midtempo pop blues, and house/synthpop to contemporary R The album showcases her passion for dance music, relying on more upbeat, catchy tunes. Nina expressed that the album's direction to a new sound reflects to her new improved self, saying [...] "I have changed a lot. From the time I came out with the Heaven album [...] I gained a lot of the confidence that I have now when I started gaining awards but not too much that it went to my head. It's <b>confidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> singing and performing and letting people know that I'm a singer." [...] She stated that the album will be a studio album with two covers, and that its sound is going to be [...] "sexy-soul," [...] which she defined as [...] "singing from the soul but having a degree of sexiness to it." [...] Stay Alive is heavily considered as Nina's comeback in the recording scene, being described as a mixture of pop, club and R songs which is very different from her previous sound. She admitted the idea of wanting to try something new, saying [...] "I want to try {{a different}} genre that’s why we decided {{to come up with a}} dance album," [...] recalling her dance performances onstage during concerts and how it will be some sort of experiment for her. She also wants people to know that she loves to dance, and that she dares to show a more sexy, sensual side for the album. In preparation, she decided to maintain physical fitness by working out, playing tennis, and practicing boxing everyday. She expressed hard work and exercise to improve her natural physique, proudly stating [...] "I want to be a role model when it comes to body.
