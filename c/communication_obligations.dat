40|$|For {{embedded}} control software – {{especially in}} form of networks of interacting com-ponents – correctness of inter-communication is a key issue. While architectural com-patibility notions do not capture the necessary dynamic aspects, analysis based on full behavioral models does not yet scale for practical applications. Here, <b>communication</b> <b>obligations</b> offer a trade-off between completeness and usability. For describing em-bedded control software, these obligations essentially depend on signal-related issues like state/event communication as well as application-related issues like modes of op-eration. To motivate the use of <b>communication</b> <b>obligations,</b> we introduce the concepts of state and event signals as well as modes of communication; furthermore, their for-malization and analysis using temporal model checking is sketched. ...|$|E
30|$|The {{authorisation}} requirement aims {{to ensure a}} high level of protection by reducing emissions of SVHC from imported articles. Taking into account the overall purposes of REACH the restriction scheme also aims to ensure {{a high level of}} protection. However, with respect to reducing emissions of SVHC from imported articles, the comparison of both instruments shows that the authorisation scheme is clearly more effective since the respective requirement comes into effect more quickly, it shifts the burden of proof to the actors responsible for the possible risk and allows for case-by-case decisions to grant authorisation. The restriction in turn is not equally effective and, therefore, no preferable measure in terms of Article  2.2 TBT. Similarly, other alternative measures such as extended information and <b>communication</b> <b>obligations</b> for SVHC in imported articles or labelling obligations for this product group might be less intrusive than the extended authorisation scheme {{but at the same time}} not as effective [15].|$|E

Baudrillard’s views on consumers in and of a postmodern society are employed to describe the users (researchers) vis-à-vis interactions with the metadata described. Hyperreality leads naturally into Introna’s call for a personal relationship as {{the sine qua non of}} obligation. This, along with Wittgenstein’s notion of ambiguities in language (meaning) grounded in activities and practices, leads to an ethical level of practice.

This article considers how signalling may facilitate coordination of competitors and why this is unlikely to fit the legal requirement for an arrangement. Consideration is then given to whether any guidance as to when an arrangement exists can be obtained from contract law. Finally, some suggestions are offered as to the factors that would need to be considered if the existence of an arrangement was to be inferred. ...|$|R

To date, there is limited research examining end of life care and the needs of Chinese people in the UK. Understanding end-of-life care expectations in relation to this population is important for informing the development of new health policy and service initiatives, given that there are currently over 1 million Chinese people living in the UK. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the mental health, religious practices and beliefs, and services and support systems required by this community to cope with end-of-life and bereavement. In July 2011, Wai Yin Chinese Women’s Society in Manchester, UK conducted fourteen semi-structured in-depth interviews with a group of Chinese migrants (primarily women working within the margins of UK’s formal economy) to explore end-of-life care issues. The current study performed a secondary analysis of these transcripts focusing only on the stories of the eleven Chinese women. The women participants were recruited as a part of Wai Yin’s Sunshine Project, which aimed to assist Chinese migrants in improving their knowledge and understandings of their employment and immigration rights (in the UK) and to help them learn the English language. Main findings are presented in eleven broad-based themes: acculturation, culturally specific services, death and dying, Eastern practices and beliefs, gendered effects, health and health care, hereafter, language and <b>communication,</b> <b>obligations</b> versus duties and responsibilities, personal choices, and Western practices and beliefs...|$|E

Among older breast cancer survivors, arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, and overweight/obesity are most frequently reported (Bellury et al. 2012; Weaver et al. 2013). The greater the number of co-morbid conditions is associated with poor functional ability, increased symptoms, declining overall general health and quality of life, and {{increase in the number of}} physician visits (Bellury et al. 2012; Bellury et al. 2013; Deimling et al. 2009; Hays et al. 2013; Kurtz et al. 2005; Yoon et al. 2008). Social support mediates {{physical and mental}} health status in older adults (Lachman & Agrigoroaei 2010; Seeman 2000; White et al. 2009); and refers to real or perceived resources provided by others that enable a person to feel cared for, valued, and part of a network of <b>communication</b> and mutual <b>obligation</b> (Stroebe 2000). High levels of social support have been associated with improved health status, and reduced risk of physical and mental illness (Lachman & Agrigoroaei 2010; Seeman 2000; White et al. 2009). Social support has also been found to improve feelings of vulnerability (Seeman 2000).|$|R
40|$|This {{current study}} focuses on {{exploring}} expectations of World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farming (WWOOF) hosts and volunteers participating in various countries using online semi-structured interview method. Using psychological contract theory, motivation is discovered as playing {{an important role}} in the formation of expectations of 27 hosts and 20 volunteers. When comparing motivation of both groups, they display contrast, similarity and complementarity. Expectations as contents of the psychological contract of hosts and volunteers are both transactional and relational in nature. The transactional aspect include work, food, accommodation and learning opportunities while the relational aspect involve social life and cultural exchange. Both hosts and volunteers view <b>communication</b> as mutual <b>obligation</b> and one of the main challenges of their exchange relationship. The psychological contract of hosts and volunteers include their relationship with their respective WWOOF organizations. Communication from these organizations influences the formation of expectations of hosts and volunteers. Finally, all hosts and volunteers who were motivated to continue cited the benefits they gained from the woofing experience in the form of met expectations and unexpected positive outcomes. In contrast, perceived breach and violation of their psychological contract as described through self-reported accounts may lead to shortening of hosting and early withdrawal from volunteering. Hosts respond to violation of contract by requesting their volunteers to leave...|$|R

40|$|Communication {{lives in}} {{the very heart of}} an organization. Any effort of {{development}} in an organization should take into consideration primarily human resources and their way of achieving goals through efficient communication. The main features of organizational communication are generated by its goal, objectives, roles, frame, structure, and context of organizational culture. Organizational communication respects certain and specific rules of ethics that are easy identified in organizational culture, in organizational policy and in the individual managers ethics. The process of organizational communication has in its basis characteristic concepts, principles, standards and rules. An efficient manager does not communicate randomly and at ease but respecting a strategy as far as the communication act is concerned and on the level of organization, the manager adopts certain communication techniques that support the implementation of the organization strategy. Thus, this is the climate on which rely the productivity and the capacity of change in organization, therefore its way to success. Organizational communication implies two partners: manager and employee. Both partners could be transmitters or receivers and they both have the same desires, namely to facilitate through communication the achievement of the objectives proposed. Often, manager’s personality represents a barrier between the two partners. It is very important to determine the role of each and everyone in the process of <b>communication</b> and the <b>obligations</b> that everyone has in the organization. Organizational communication appeared as a management discipline out of necessity to offer the manager best interaction ways in order to function properly in conducting his role...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} {{communication}} service providers’ responsibilities for ensuring {{the protection of}} the fundamental right to privacy and data protection of their customers in relation to law enforcement access to data stored by private entities. It relates to on the one hand what <b>obligation</b> <b>communication</b> service providers have to provide authorities with information and on the other hand, what companies can do in order to strengthen the level of protection for their users. The question is important since it affects the legal certainty for both individuals using the services as well as the companies providing them in a negative way. The research question is approached by analysing the possible horizontal effect of Article 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in order to assess whether companies have a responsibility to apply fundamental rights in their activities on their own initiative. Further, Finnish national legislation on data retention obligations and law enforcement agencies’ access to data stored by companies will be reviewed in the light of EU and CoE law. The thesis also pay attention to what the initiative for an Intelligence Act will have in store for communication service providers. When it comes to conclusions, it will be seen, that the horizontal effect of fundamental rights is a debated area. Also, national legislation provides very few guidelines on how companies should act when faced with law enforcement access requests. In lack of clear guidance and with respect to the global nature of communication services, many companies turn to Corporate Social Responsibility and privacy policies in order to communicate their standing on privacy matters to their customers. This phenomenon will be analysed as an alternative that could help increase awareness on how different communication service providers meet data access requirements from authorities...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Industrial Sociology)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2008. The present era in South Africa is {{one that}} is marked by {{substantial}} change due to unparalleled advancement in the field of technology, globalisation and competitive markets. These changes have placed new demands on the education sector in South Africa, especially further education. In 2000 / 1 South Africa's Further Education and Training (FET) sector has been rejuvenated through a process of transformation when 152 former Technical Colleges and Colleges of Education merged to form 50 multi-campus FET Colleges. The rationale behind this merging process is to curb the serious skills shortage which is threatening economic growth in this country through offering vocational education and training; and to raise quality in the education sector. This re-engineering process in education is founded on principles of equity, human rights, democracy and sustainable development. Change, however, is also about people and their ideas, fears, capacity and ability to stand and work together towards a more prosperous future for all. Transformation or change such as with mergers is dependent on employees' total commitment towards realising the organisation's objectives. High levels of organisational commitment tend to encourage loyalty, higher levels of productiveness and general job satisfaction. For change initiatives to be successful though, communication across all hierarchical levels is of the utmost importance. Management is expected to provide employees with just treatment, provide acceptable working conditions, clearly communicate what is regarded as a fair day's work, and give feedback on how well the employee is doing. Employees, in return, are expected to clearly show a good attitude, follow directions and be loyal towards x the organisation. The psychological contract is utilised to investigate the scope of change in an employment relationship. The psychological contract is a contract setting out mutual expectations between employer and employee - a contract that forms the backbone of any new relationship such as with a merger. The researcher makes use of the psychological contract (by utilising the Tilburgse Psychologisch Contract Vragenlijst (TPC)) to explain employer obligations; violation of employer obligations; employee obligations; relational/transactional contract values; commitment; intention to leave; and change perceptions. Should either employment party not fulfill its contractual terms in any way, the psychological contract will be breached or violated and the employee might attempt to balance the situation by reducing his or her job efforts, badmouthing the organisation, resorting to absenteeism or even petty theft. The worst case scenario in this destructive process is that the employee might leave the organisation. The purpose of this research study is to determine the effect (if any) that the mergers might have had on the psychological- and employment contracts in the four FET Colleges that have remained in the Free State Province. A cross-sectional survey design was used to reach the objective of this research and an English translation of the aforementioned questionnaire (TPC) was randomly distributed amongst the total population of 375 employees at the Free State FET Colleges involved in this study. A response rate of 53 % (n = 200) was achieved. Results from other authors who have used the TPC Questionnaire in their research offer support for the validity and reliability of the scales used. The statistical analysis was carried out with the SPSS program (SPSS, 2006), a program that is used to conduct statistical analysis regarding reliability and validity of the measuring instruments, descriptive statistics, t-tests, analysis of variance, correlation coefficients and multiple regression analysis. XI In Article 1 the researcher focused on the effect of mergers with regard to the influence of communication on the psychological contract as a possible factor affecting the intention to qUit. A multiple regression analysis (with intention to quit as dependent variable; and employer obligations, employee <b>obligations,</b> and <b>communication</b> as independent variables) was performed and 22. 2 % of the variance in intention to quit is predicted by <b>communication</b> and employee <b>obligations</b> (F = 28. 07, p 0. 30) was found between • change and job satisfaction; • job satisfaction and: commitment, employer obligations, employer violations; • commitment and: employer obligations, employer violations; and • employee obligations and: employer obligations, employer violations. A multiple regression analysis (with job satisfaction as dependent variable; and employer violation, organisational commitment, and change as independent variables) was performed and 29. 9 % of the variance in job satisfaction is predicted by employer violations, change and commitment (F = 27. 668, p< 0. 01). Recommendations for the organisation as well as for future research were made. Master...|$|R
