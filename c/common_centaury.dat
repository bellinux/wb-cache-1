50|$|Centaurium exaltatum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the gentian family known by the <b>common</b> names desert <b>centaury</b> and tall centaury. It is native to much of western North America from British Columbia to Arizona to Nebraska, where it grows in moist areas, generally with alkaline soils. This is an annual herb which is variable in appearance, especially in different habitat types. It grows up to about 35 centimeters in height, its slender stem with widely spaced pairs of oppositely arranged, pointed leaves 1 to 3 centimeters long. The inflorescence is an open array of flowers, each on a pedicel which may be several centimeters in length. The flower has generally four or five white or pink lobes, each somewhat rolled to appear narrow in shape.|$|R
50|$|Woodnook Valley {{has been}} a SSSI since March 1986. It {{is an example of}} a {{calcareous}} grassland. On the site are two types of orchid - the early purple orchid, and the man orchid. There is also the carline thistle, the mouse-ear hawkweed, harebell, glaucous sedge and the <b>common</b> <b>centaury.</b> Insect life is apparent when grassland plants are in flower. Garden bumblebees can be seen on field scabious and lycaenid butterflies typical of this habitat such as the small copper and common blue, and a variety of browns including meadow brown, gatekeeper and ringlet can also be seen. Raptors such as the kestrel, buzzard and red kite also inhabit the area, hunting small rodents and rabbits which inhabit the grassland.|$|E
40|$|Proper {{determination}} of tissues {{is one of}} the challenging problems in modern medicine and histology. Currently, interpretation of the results mainly depends on the experience of a histologist, leading to high percentage of results misinterpretation. Bearing in mind potential application, we proposed the set of procedures that allow us to obtain precise, mathematically determined parameters for tissue discrimination. First, the method was tested on simulated set of images and compared with several other algorithms. As the set of experimentally obtained input data, auto-fluorescence images of needle cross sections (Picea[*]omorika) and stamens of <b>common</b> <b>centaury</b> (Centaurium[*]erythraea) were used. Determination of cell types is based on inherent features of plant cells – auto-fluorescence. As each cell type consists of various fluorescent components in different quantities for each type of tissue, its integral emission spectrum can be used as the fingerprint for identification. Cross sections were imaged using four sets of filters for detection of fluorescence (both excitation and emission). Such filter set is standard equipment for most fluorescence microscopes. One additional image was transmission image using the same optics. By applying ℓ 0 -norm-constrained nonnegative matrix factorization in a space induced by explicit feature maps, it is possible to identify up to 11 tissues in needles and five in stamens (actual number of tissues). In comparison to other image analysis methods, the greatest advantage {{is the fact that the}} number of extracted components significantly exceeds the number of initial images while most other techniques can extract only as much components as the number of initial images...|$|E
40|$|Healing {{with plants}} of {{medicinal}} significance {{is as old}} as mankind itself. The awareness of usage of medicinal plants by human beings for the treatment of diverse ailments, is a result of thousands of years of struggles, since, by trial and error, man distinguished between the beneficial and poisonous plants. Ample evidence from various sources - be it written documents, preserved monuments, and even original plant medicines supporting the connection between man and his search for drugs innature dates from the far past. Be it the Indian Holy Books like the Vedas dating around 5000 B. C., or the Chinese book “Pen T’Sao,” written by Emperor Shen Nung in 2500 B. C. describing 365 drugs derived from various dried parts of medicinal plants - various such historical sources relevant for the study of medicinal plants’ use are present. The oldest written evidence of the use of medicinal plants for preparation of drugs has been found on a Sumerian clay slab from Nagpur, approximately 5000 years old (Kelly, 2009). The Ebers Papyrus written in 1550 B. C. refers to 700 plant species and drugs used for therapy such as pomegranate, castorbean, aloe, senna, garlic, onion, fig, willow, coriander, juniper, <b>common</b> <b>centaury,</b> etc. Homer's epics - The Iliad and The Odysseys created in 800 B. C. refer to 63 plant species from the Minoan, Mycenaean, and Egyptian Assyrian pharmacotherapy. Herodotus (500 B. C.) referred to castor oil plant, Orpheus to the fragrant hellebore and garlic, and Pythagoras to the sea onion (Scilla maritima), mustard, and cabbage. The works of Hippocrates (459 B. C. - 370 B. C.) contain about 300 medicinal plants classified by physiological action. Theophrast (371 B. C. - 287 B. C.) gained the epithet of “the father of botany” for his great merits for the classification and description of medicinal plants. He generated a classification of more than 500 medicinal plants known at the time in his books “De Causis Plantarium”— Plant Etiology and “De Historia Plantarium”—Plant History. Celsus (25 B. C. - 50 A. D.), the renowned medical writer quoted approximately 250 medicinal plants such as aloe, henbane, flax, poppy, pepper, cinnamon, the star gentian, cardamom, false hellebore, etc. in his work “De re medica”. In ancient history, the most prominent writer on plant drugs was Dioscorides, “the father of pharmacognosy” who wrote the work “De Materia Medica”. This classical work of ancient history offers plenty of data on the medicinal plants constituting the basic materia medica until the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Pliny the Elder (23 A. D. - 79 A. D.), a contemporary of Dioscorides, who travelled throughout Germanyand Spain, wrote about approximately 1000 medicinal plants in his book “Historia naturalis. ”...|$|E
