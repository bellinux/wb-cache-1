50|$|<b>Celgosivir,</b> in {{development}} by Migenix {{for the treatment}} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, is an oral prodrug of the natural product castanospermine that inhibits alpha-glucosidase I, an enzyme that plays a critical role in viral maturation by initiating the processing of the N-linked oligosaccharides of viral envelope glycoproteins. <b>Celgosivir</b> is well absorbed in vitro and in vivo, and is rapidly converted to castanospermine. <b>Celgosivir</b> has a novel mechanism of action (i.e. host-directed glycosylation), and demonstrates broad antiviral activity in vitro.|$|E

50|$|Although {{generally}} {{safe and}} well tolerated, <b>celgosivir</b> {{does not seem}} to reduce viral load or fever burden in patients with dengue fever.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Clinical trials== <b>Celgosivir</b> is not {{efficient}} as a monotherapy {{for the treatment}} of HCV, but has demonstrated a synergistic effect in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin, both in vitro and in phase II clinical trials that last up to 1 year in patients with chronic HCV infection. <b>Celgosivir</b> may prove to be a valuable component for combination therapy and may help to prevent the apparition of drug resistance. Long-term toxicity studies are necessary to confirm the safety of this novel drug in humans.|$|E
40|$|CELADEN was a {{randomized}} placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients with confirmed dengue fever {{to evaluate the}} efficacy and safety of <b>celgosivir</b> (A study registered at ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01619969). <b>Celgosivir</b> was given as a 400 mg loading dose and 200 mg bid (twice a day) over 5 days. Replication competent virus was measured by plaque assay and compared to reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qPCR) of viral RNA. Pharmacokinetics (PK) correlations with viremia, immunological profiling, next generation sequence (NGS) analysis and hematological data were evaluated as exploratory endpoints here to identify possible signals of pharmacological activity. Viremia by plaque assay strongly correlated with qPCR during the first four days. Immunological profiling demonstrated a qualitative shift in T helper cell profile {{during the course of}} infection. NGS analysis did not reveal any prominent signature that could be associated with drug treatment; however the phylogenetic spread of patients' isolates underlines the importance of strain variability that may potentially confound interpretation of dengue drug trials conducted during different outbreaks and in different countries. <b>Celgosivir</b> rapidly converted to castanospermine (Cast) with mean peak and trough concentrations of 5727 ng/mL (30. 2 μM) and 430 ng/mL (2. 3 μM), respectively and cleared with a half-life of 2. 5 (± 0. 6) hr. Mean viral log reduction between day 2 and 4 (VLR 2 - 4) was significantly greater in secondary dengue than primary dengue (p = 0. 002). VLR 2 - 4 did not correlate with drug AUC but showed a trend of greater response with increasing Cmin. PK modeling identified dosing regimens predicted to achieve 2. 4 to 4. 5 times higher Cmin. than in the CELADEN trial for only 13 % to 33 % increase in overall dose. A small, non-statistical trend towards better outcome on platelet nadir and difference between maximum and minimum hematocrit was observed in celgosivir-treated patients with secondary dengue infection. Optimization of the dosing regimen and patient stratification may enhance the ability of a clinical trial to demonstrate <b>celgosivir</b> activity in treating dengue fever based on hematological endpoints. A new clinical trial with a revised dosing regimen is slated to start in 2016 (NCT 02569827). Furthermore celgosivir's potential value for treatment of other flaviruses such as Zika virus should be investigated urgently. ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01619969...|$|E
40|$|Dengue {{virus is}} an {{emerging}} human pathogen that poses a huge public health burden by infecting annually about 390 million individuals {{of which a}} quarter report with clinical manifestations. Although {{progress has been made}} in understanding dengue pathogenesis, a licensed vaccine or antiviral therapy against this virus is still lacking. Treatment of patients is confined to symptomatic alleviation and supportive care. The development of dengue therapeutics thus remains of utmost importance. This review focuses on the few molecules that were evaluated in dengue virus-infected patients: balapiravir, chloroquine, lovastatin, prednisolone and <b>celgosivir.</b> The lessons learned from these clinical trials can be very helpful for the design of future trials for the next generation of dengue virus inhibitors. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been thought that iminosugar {{antiviral}} activity {{is a function of}} inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidases, and on this basis, many iminosugars have been investigated as therapeutic agents for treatment of infection by a diverse spectrum of viruses, including dengue virus (DENV). However, iminosugars are glycomimetics possessing a nitrogen atom in place of the endocyclic oxygen atom, and the ubiquity of glycans in host metabolism suggests that multiple pathways can be targeted via iminosugar treatment. Successful treatment of patients with glycolipid processing defects using iminosugars highlights the clinical exploitation of iminosugar inhibition of enzymes other than ER α-glucosidases. Evidence correlating antiviral activity with successful inhibition of ER glucosidases together with the exclusion of alternative mechanisms of action of iminosugars in the context of DENV infection is limited. <b>Celgosivir,</b> a bicyclic iminosugar evaluated in phase Ib clinical trials as a therapeutic for the treatment of DENV infection, was confirmed to be antiviral in a lethal mouse model of antibody-enhanced DENV infection. In this study we provide the first evidence of the antiviral activity of <b>celgosivir</b> in primary human macrophages in vitro, in which it inhibits DENV secretion with an EC 50 of 5 μM. We further demonstrate that monocyclic glucose-mimicking iminosugars inhibit isolated glycoprotein and glycolipid processing enzymes and that this inhibition also occurs in primary cells treated with these drugs. By comparison to bicyclic glucose-mimicking iminosugars which inhibit glycoprotein processing but do not inhibit glycolipid processing and galactose-mimicking iminosugars which do not inhibit glycoprotein processing but do inhibit glycolipid processing, we demonstrate that inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum-resident α-glucosidases, not glycolipid processing, is responsible for iminosugar antiviral activity against DENV. Our data suggest that inhibition of ER α-glucosidases prevents release of virus and is the primary antiviral mechanism of action of iminosugars against DENV...|$|E
