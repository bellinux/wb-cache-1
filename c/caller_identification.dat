50|$|The {{corresponding}} {{service to}} DID for outgoing calls from a PBX {{to the central}} office exchange is called direct outward dialing (DOD) or Direct Dial Central Office (DDCO). This service is often combined with DID service and allows direct dialing of global telephone numbers by every extension covered by the service without the assistance of an operator. The <b>caller</b> line <b>identification</b> (CLI) or caller-id of extensions for outgoing calls is often set to the extension DID number, but may be the organization's central switch board number.|$|R
50|$|Call centers use IVR {{systems to}} {{identify}} and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option {{to wait in the}} queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain <b>caller</b> line <b>identification</b> (CLI) data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.|$|R

40|$|More {{and more}} people are using mobile (cellular) phones and the world is {{increasingly}} becoming unwired due to diffusion of this technology. The cellular technology is present in most Asian countries since 1980 s. However, its diffusion process in these countries has largely been affected by technological developments, i. e., transition from analogue to digital, and regulations. The nature of regulations relate to spectrum licensing and the number of competitors allowed by respective governments. These regulatory decisions may explain the current structure of mobile phone industry in most of these countries. The popularity of cellular communication lies in its appealing advantage as compared with the fixed networks. The most important feature of a cellular phone is its portability in that the call is made to a person and not to a place. In developed countries, the features available on mobile handsets (such as <b>caller</b> line <b>identification,</b> voice mail, call forwarding, call waiting and the facility of receiving and transmitting short text messages) are available free of charge. However, these cell phone facilities are very costly in developing countries as compared with their fixed networks. The regulatory licensing structure prevailing in these countries partly explains this price differential. In effect there has been wide diversity in the speed of introduction of mobile phones and their diffusion across developing countries, which has not been explored. Gruber and Verboven (1998) has recently examined diffusion of cell phones in the European Union. However, this is a neglected area of research in developing countries. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a conversation}} analytic examination of recurrent practices of interaction in medicalemergency calls. The study expands the analytical focus in past research on emergency calls betweenemergency call operators and callers to pre-hospital emergency care interaction {{on the phone}} betweennurses, physicians and callers. The investigation is based on ethnographic fieldwork in a Swedish emergencycontrol centre. The data used for the study consists primarily of audio recordings of medical emergency calls. Fundamental procedures in medical emergency calls examined in the dissertation are: (1) questioning; (2) emotion management; (3) risk management and (4) instruction giving. Emergency call-takers ask questions toelicit descriptions by callers {{of what is happening}} and to manage symptoms of patients to help keep them safeuntil ambulance crews arrive. In the questioning practice about acutely ill or injured patients call-takers usemainly yes-no questions and clarify problems by questioning callers making a distinction between defined andundefined problems. The analysis reveals four core types of emotion management practices: (1) call-takerskeep themselves calm when managing callers’ social displays of emotions; (2) promising ambulanceassistance; (3) providing problem solving presentations including emergency response measures to concernsof callers, and (4) emphasising the positive to create hope for callers. Call-takers use seven key procedures tomanage risk in medical emergency calls: (1) risk listening through active listening after actual and possiblerisks; (2) risk questioning; (3) risk identification; (4) risk monitoring; (5) risk assessment; (6) making decisionsabout elicited risk and (7) risk reduction. Instruction giving using directives and recommendations isaccomplished by call-takers in four main ways: (1) acute flow maintaining instruction giving when callers areprocedurally out of line; (2) measure oriented instructions for patient care and emergency responsemanagement; (3) organisational response instructions and (4) summarising instruction giving. <b>Callers</b> routinelyacknowledge risk <b>identifications</b> and follow instructions delivered by call-takers to examine statuses and lifesigns of patients such as breathing, movement and pulse, and perform basic first aid and emergency responsemeasures. The findings generated from this study will be useful in emergency call-taker training in carrying out interactiveprocedures in medical emergency calls and add to the larger research programmes on on-telephoneinteraction between professionals and citizen callers. This is an essential book for pre-hospital emergency careproviders and institutional interaction researchers and students. At the Faculty of Social Sciences in the subject of Sociology</p...|$|R

50|$|Malicious <b>caller</b> <b>identification</b> facility, {{also called}} {{malicious}} call trace or caller activated {{malicious call trace}}, when subscribed or enabled, works by allowing a phone call recipient to mark or flag the preceding phone call connection as malicious (i.e. harassing, threatening, obscene, etc.) The phone system will then automatically trace the call by flagging station to station billing and routing data including start and end times. The call trace is not dependent upon call duration (as envisioned in dramatic movie plots) and will record all meta-data regardless of source conditions - even if the call was made from an unlisted number, a payphone or a number with <b>caller</b> <b>identification</b> disabled. To protect privacy the resulting trace data is only made available to law enforcement.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{mechanisms}} used by signaling methods prior to SS7 (battery reversal, multi-frequency digit outpulsing, A- and B-bit signaling), these older methods could not communicate much signaling information. Usually only the dialed digits were signaled, and merely during call setup. For charged calls, dialed digits and charge number digits were outpulsed. SS7, being a high-speed and high-performance packet-based communications protocol, can communicate {{significant amounts of}} information when setting up a call, during the call, {{and at the end}} of the call. This permits rich call-related services to be developed. Some of the first such services were call management related, call forwarding (busy and no answer), voice mail, call waiting, conference calling, calling name and number display, call screening, malicious <b>caller</b> <b>identification,</b> busy callback.|$|E

50|$|After several {{attempts}} and experiments, {{he realized that}} in order for the telephone {{to be able to read}} the caller's telephone number, it must possess intelligence so he developed the method in which the caller's number is transmitted to the called receiver's device.

50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{personal}} computer technology in the 1980s, computer telephony integration (CTI) has progressively provided more sophisticated telephony services, initiated and controlled by the computer, such as making and receiving voice, fax, and data calls with telephone directory services and <b>caller</b> <b>identification.</b> The integration of telephony software and computer systems is a major development {{in the evolution of}} the automated office. The term is used in describing the computerized services of call centers, such as those that direct your phone call to the right department at a business you're calling. It's also sometimes used to describe the ability to use your personal computer to initiate and manage phone calls (in which case you can think of your computer as your personal call center). CTI is not a new concept and has been used in the past in large telephone networks, but only dedicated call centers could justify the costs of the required equipment installation. Primary telephone service providers are offering information services such as automatic number identification, which is a telephone service architecture that separates CTI services from call switching and will make it easier to add new services. Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) on a scale is wide enough for its implementation to bring real value to business or residential telephone usage. A new generation of applications (middleware) is being developed as a result of standardization and availability of low cost computer telephony links.|$|E
