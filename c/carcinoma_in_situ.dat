40|$|BACKGROUNd: Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) {{is a rare}} genodermatosis that is {{characterized}} by susceptibility to infection with specific human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes. Among polyomaviruses, the novel Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) {{has been found in}} different epithelial skin neoplasias. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether EV is associated with cutaneous MCPyV infection. METHODS: We used MCPyV-specific PCR to study skin neoplasms of 6 congenital EV patients and of 1 patient with acquired EV. RESULTS: In all congenital EV patients, MCPyV DNA was found <b>in</b> <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ,</b> <b>in</b> invasive squamous cell <b>carcinomas</b> and <b>in</b> common warts. In 4 of these patients, the MCPyV-positive skin lesions were from different anatomic locations. In addition, 1 immunosuppressed patient suffering from acquired EV harbored MCPyV DNA in 2 common warts. In contrast, 7 normal skin samples tested negative for MCPyV DNA. Only 2 out of 24 <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> (8. 3 %) and 2 out of 30 common warts (6. 7 %) from immunocompetent individuals were positive for MCPyV DNA. CONCLUSIONS: The strong association of EV-associated skin neoplasms with MCPyV suggests a unique susceptibility of EV patients to infections with MCPyV. Both MCPyV and EV-HPV may act as synergistic oncogenic cofactors in the development of EV-associated skin neoplasms...|$|R

Sequences homologous to the probe were detected in 16 of 24 papillomas, five of five <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> and six of 38 {{squamous cell}} carcinomas. A number of tumour DNAs (16 / 33) also hybridized with mixed DNAs of human papillomavirus types 11, 13, 16 and 18 at reduced stringency.

25|$|Histopathology. Breast {{cancer is}} usually {{classified}} primarily by its histological appearance. Most breast cancers {{are derived from}} the epithelium lining the ducts or lobules, and these cancers are classified as ductal or lobular carcinoma. <b>Carcinoma</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> is growth of low-grade cancerous or precancerous cells within a particular tissue compartment such as the mammary duct without invasion of the surrounding tissue. In contrast, invasive carcinoma does not confine itself to the initial tissue compartment.|$|E
25|$|If {{the stage}} is based on removal of the cancer with surgery and review by the pathologist, the letter p (for pathologic) or yp (pathologic after neoadjuvant therapy) may appear before the T and N letters.

25|$|Tumor (American English) or tumour (British English), Latin for swelling, {{one of the}} {{cardinal}} signs of inflammation, originally meant any form of swelling, neoplastic or not.

In this study, the presence of nerve fibers was investigated in a cohort of 369 primary breast cancers (ductal <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ,</b> invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas) by immunohistochemistry for the neuronal marker PGP 9. 5. Isolated nerve fibers (axons) were detected in 28 % of invasive ductal carcinomas as compared to only 12 % of invasive lobular carcinomas and 8 % of ductal <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> (p= 0. 0003). In invasive breast cancers, the presence of nerve fibers was observed in 15 % of lymph node negative tumors and 28 % of lymph node positive tumors (p= 0. 0031), indicating {{a relationship with the}} metastatic potential. In addition, there was an association between the presence of nerve fibers and the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) in cancer cells (p= 0. 0001). In vitro, breast cancer cells were able to induce neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells, and this neurotrophic activity was partially inhibited by anti-NGF blocking antibodies. In conclusion, infiltration by nerve fibers is a feature {{of the tumor}} microenvironment that is associated with aggressiveness and involves NGF production by cancer cells. The potential participation of nerve fibers in breast cancer progression needs to be further considered...|$|R

25|$|The {{stage of}} the breast cancer is the most {{important}} component of traditional classification methods of breast cancer, because it has a greater effect on the prognosis than the other considerations. Staging takes into consideration size, local involvement, lymph node status and whether metastatic disease is present. The higher the stage at diagnosis, the poorer the prognosis. The stage is raised by the invasiveness of disease to lymph nodes, chest wall, skin or beyond, and the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. The stage is lowered by the presence of cancer-free zones and close-to-normal cell behaviour (grading). Size is not a factor in staging unless the cancer is invasive. For example, Ductal <b>Carcinoma</b> <b>In</b> <b>Situ</b> (DCIS) involving the entire breast will still be stage zero and consequently an excellent prognosis with a 10-year disease free survival of about 98%.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{has been shown}} to detect cancers not visible on mammograms. The chief strength of breast MRI is its very high negative predictive value. A negative MRI can rule out the presence of cancer to a high degree of certainty, making it an excellent tool for screening in patients at high genetic risk or radiographically dense breasts, and for pre-treatment staging where the extent of disease is difficult to determine on mammography and ultrasound. MRI can diagnose benign proliferative change, fibroadenomas, and other common benign findings at a glance, often eliminating the need for costly and unnecessary biopsies or surgical procedures. The spatial and temporal resolution of breast MRI has increased markedly in recent years, making it possible to detect or rule out the presence of small in situ cancers, including ductal <b>carcinoma</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ.</b>|$|E

The antibody PAb 421 detected the protein in 31. 5 per cent; all positive with the other antibodies. Well-differentiated oestrogen receptor-positive tumours had a low incidence of p 53 detection. Variation in the percentage of reactivity was seen between <b>carcinomas</b> and <b>in</b> some cases between different antibodies in the same cancer.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{correlation}} between type of breast cyst {{and risk of}} breast cancer in women with gross cystic disease of the breast. DESIGN: Cohort study of women with breast cysts aspirated between 1983 and 1993 who were followed up until December 1994 for occurrence of breast cancer. SETTING: Major cancer prevention centre. SUBJECTS: 802 women with aspirated breast cysts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of breast cyst based on cationic content of cyst fluid: type I (potassium:sodium ratio > 1. 5), type II (potassium:sodium ratio < 1. 5), or mixed (both types). Subsequent occurrence and type of breast cancer. RESULTS: After median follow up of six years (range 2 - 12 years) 15 cases of invasive breast cancer and two ductal <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> were diagnosed <b>in</b> the cohort: 12 invasive cancers (and two <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ)</b> among the 417 women with type I cysts, two cancers among the 325 women with type II cysts, and one among the 60 women with mixed cysts. The incidence of breast cancer in women with type I cysts was significantly higher than that in women with type II cysts (relative risk 4. 62 (95 % confidence interval 1. 26 to 29. 7)). These results were confirmed after adjustment for several risk factors for breast cancer (relative risk 4. 24 (1. 12 to 27. 5)).

40|$|Amplification of the neu {{proto-oncogene}} {{in breast}} cancer {{has been reported to}} correlate with the presence of lymph-node metastases and with a poor prognosis. We describe a method for the immunohistochemical detection of overexpression of neu protein on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, with the use of two different monoclonal antibodies. In a group of tumors with a known neu-gene copy number, intense membrane staining of tumor cells was present in all tumors with neu-gene amplification. Of 189 tumors from patients with Stage II breast cancer, 27 (14 percent) had neu-membrane staining. Neu overexpression was associated with larger tumor size (P = 0. 006) but not with lymph-node involvement. Neu-protein expression in lymph-node metastases was the same as its expression in primary tumors. Among the patients with neu overexpression (median follow-up, 37 months), disease-free survival was not significantly shorter; overall survival was reduced significantly in these patients (P = 0. 042), but this reduction did not remain significant after adjustment for tumor size. Of 45 ductal <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ,</b> 19 (42 percent) had neu-membrane staining. These 19 were all of the large-cell, comedo growth type. None of 16 ductal <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> of small-cell, papillary, or cribriform growth type had neu overexpression.

25|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{developing}} breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, {{hormone replacement therapy}} during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 5–10% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, {{there are more than}} 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal <b>carcinoma</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ,</b> develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to.|$|E
25|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} {{classified}} as an adenocarcinoma, or glandular cancer, that begins when normal semen-secreting prostate gland cells mutate into cancer cells. The region of prostate gland where the adenocarcinoma is most common is the peripheral zone. Initially, small clumps of cancer cells remain confined to otherwise normal prostate glands, a condition known as <b>carcinoma</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Although {{there is no proof}} that PIN is a cancer precursor, it is closely associated with cancer. Over time, these cancer cells begin to multiply and spread to the surrounding prostate tissue (the stroma) forming a tumor. Eventually, the tumor may grow large enough to invade nearby organs such as the seminal vesicles or the rectum, or the tumor cells may develop the ability to travel in the bloodstream and lymphatic system. Prostate cancer is considered a malignant tumor because it is a mass of cells that can invade other parts of the body. This invasion of other organs is called metastasis. Prostate cancer most commonly metastasizes to the bones, lymph nodes, and may invade rectum, bladder and lower ureters after local progression. The route of metastasis to bone is thought to be venous as the prostatic venous plexus draining the prostate connects with the vertebral veins.|$|E

Cyclin B 1, but not Cdc 2, immunostaining rapidly disappeared from the nuclei during the mitotic metaphase to anaphase transition. Static image analysis revealed the mean proliferative index for cyclin B 1 /cdc 2 {{for each type of}} lesion to be as follows: normal glands (n = 20), 2. 0 / 2. 5 %; benign lesions, including typical ductal hyperplasia (n = 76), 2. 5 / 5. 8 %; atypical ductal hyperplasia (n = 21), 3. 0 / 6. 6 %; <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> (n = 70), 7. 4 / 14. 0 %; and invasive carcinomas (n = 58), 10. 0 / 22. 9 %.

Furthermore, the proliferative index for cyclin B 1 for comedo-type ductal <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> agreed with that for invasive ductal carcinomas (mean, 10. 1 % versus 9. 5 %), apparently explaining the clinicopathological aggressiveness of this tumor at the molecular level...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Mammography (MRM) {{in the evaluation of}} the contralateral breast in patients with recently diagnosed breast cancer. Materials and methods. Fifty patients with proved unilateral breast cancer, with a negative contralateral breast at physical examination, ultrasound and mammography, were studied with a 1. 5 T magnet (Siemens, Vision Plus, Germany). A bilateral breast surface coil was used. Dynamic 3 D Flash T 1 -weighted sequences were acquired in the axial plane before and 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 minutes after the administration of 0. 1 mmol/kg of Gd-BOPTA at a flow rate of 2 ml/s followed by 10 ml of saline. The level of suspicion was reported on a scale from 0 to 5 following the BI-RADS classification, based on lesion morphology and kinetic features. The results were compared with the histological findings after biopsy or surgery. Results. Fourteen out of 50 patients (28 %) had contralateral lesions identified on MRM. Biopsy was performed in four of them for suspicious lesions (BI-RADS 4) while 10 patients underwent surgery because of highly suggestive malignant lesions (BI-RADS 5). Histology diagnosed three fibroadenomas, 5 ductal <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ,</b> 2 lobular <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ,</b> 3 invasive ductal carcinomas and 1 invasive lobular carcinoma.

To study the integrity of basement membranes (BMs) and the possible invasion of the dysplastic epithelium, immunostainings for the BM proteins laminin and type IV collagen were used. Nine of the 17 dysplasias showed p 53 protein expression (53 %); it was significantly more often seen in severe dysplasias and <b>carcinomas</b> <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> than <b>in</b> mild or moderate dysplasias (P = 0. 04). The p 53 antigenicity was generally located in the basal part of the epithelium. The BMs beneath mildly dysplastic epithelia were continuous.
