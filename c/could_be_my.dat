500|$|Pugh re-joined Hereford on a {{permanent}} basis following their relegation into League Two, signing a one-year contract on 30 June 2009. Upon this move, he realised that he [...] "needed to knuckle down and get on the football ladder now, because this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> last opportunity".

500|$|Writing for entertainment.ie, Karen Lawler criticized lyrics like [...] "you <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> Coca Cola, let me sip it up" [...] {{for acting}} as a {{substitute}} for the [...] "articulate rhymes on which [...] built his reputation", Brent Faulkner from PopMatters agreed that the lyrical content was sub-par, and called the song itself [...] "utterly ridiculous". Mesfin Fekadu from The Huffington Post called Cyrus' contributions to the song [...] "forgettable". Gregory Hicks of The Michigan Daily compared [...] "Fall Down" [...] to [...] "Die Young" [...] and [...] "Crazy Kids" [...] by American recording artist Kesha, all three of which were produced by Dr. Luke, which Hicks felt indicated that [...] "Dr. Luke’s production and writing continues to dwindle as he copy and pastes his work with Ke$ha onto this will.i.am track." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{role was}} first portrayed by {{three sets of}} twins, {{including}} Avital and Amiel Weiss, Matthew and Riley Esham, and Aiden and Andrew Gonzales {{over the course of}} 2006 to 2009. The role was then rapidly aged for the first time when Tucker assumed the role in October 2009. In May 2012, it was announced that the character had been rapidly aged again to a teenager, with Ehrich scheduled to join the cast. He made his debut on June 11, 2012. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ehrich stated that he had gone through a [...] "long audition process", saying: [...] "I got a callback and did a chemistry read with someone, then came back to read with Christian LeBlanc. By the end of that audition, I knew something felt right and that he <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> father." [...] When asked about signing a contract with the series, Ehrich stated: [...] "I'm still on recurring right now. I think it's all relevant to your character and either way, in my book, it's awesome. I would sign, yes, but it'll happen when the time is right." ...|$|E

Patel, who according to captain Kane Williamson [...] "wasn't initially" [...] considered by the selectors for the tour, was named as Craig's replacement.

2500|$|Upon the {{announcement}} that Steven Moffat would leave the show in December 2017 and be replaced by new showrunner Chris Chibnall, this decision led to speculation over whether Capaldi would remain in the role or leave alongside Moffat. A month before this, Capaldi stated [...] "This <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> final year it's terrifying, I love Doctor Who {{but it can be}} an insular world and I do want to do other things. There will come a time when this is over, but I knew that when I started.

2500|$|Rose would {{occasionally}} sexually abuse the girl herself, and would later take extreme gratification in degrading {{the child with}} acts such as binding Anna Marie to various items of furniture before encouraging Fred to rape her, and forcing her to perform household chores while wearing sexual devices and a mini-skirt. From the age of 13, both Fred and Rose forced Anna Marie to prostitute herself within the household, with her clients being informed Anna Marie was 16. Nonetheless, Rose was always present {{in the room when}} these acts occurred, to ensure the girl did not reveal her true age. On one occasion when Anna Marie was aged either 13 or 14, Rose took the girl to a local pub, insisting she drink several glasses of barley wine. Several hours later, Fred arrived at the pub to collect Rose and Anna Marie. Once the trio had left the premises, Anna Marie was bundled into her father's van and beaten by Rose, who asked the girl the question: [...] "Do you think you <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> friend?" [...] before she was sexually abused by both her father and stepmother.|$|E

60|$|Having bound {{myself by}} this sacred engagement, I {{had no choice}} but to accept the {{sacrifice}} which it imperatively exacted from me.

My canvas-wrapped package was pushed in under the seat, the door was slammed to, the guard waved his green flag, Mr Waggett touched his hat: and our journey was begun.|$|E
6000|$|... "If, in reality," [...] such {{were the}} calmer {{thoughts}} {{that followed the}} first tempest of his passion--"if, in reality, this man desires {{no more than the}} law allows him--if he is willing to adjust even his acknowledged rights upon an equitable footing, what <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> father's cause of complaint?--what is mine? Those from who we won our ancient possessions fell under the sword of my ancestors, and left lands and livings to the conquerors; we sink under the force of the law, now too powerful for the Scottish cavalry. Let us parley with the victors of the day, as if we had been besieged in our fortress, and without hope of relief. This man may be other than I have thought him; and his daughter--but I have resolved not to think of her." ...|$|E
60|$|Then my {{elder brother}} returned, {{an event of}} the {{greatest}} importance in my life; and as {{he had not been}} expected so soon, I was for a minute in doubt that this strange visitor <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> brother, so greatly had he altered in appearance in those five long years of absence, which had seemed like an age to me. He had left us as a smooth-faced youth, with skin tanned to such a deep colour that with his dark piercing eyes and long black hair he had looked to me more like an Indian than a white man. Now his skin was white, and he had grown a brown beard and moustache. In disposition, too, he had grown more genial and tolerant, but I soon discovered that in character he had not changed.|$|E
60|$|And oh! could I {{have but}} taken warning by their disasters, I had been happy still, for I was yet free, and had nothing brought against me; but it <b>could</b> not <b>be,</b> <b>my</b> measure <b>was</b> not yet filled up.|$|R

From the time the ship sailed till I reached this wicked place, there wasn't a word said nor a look looked to make me think I wasn't just as right and safe there as if I had been in my own room at home. They were never anything but kind and good to me. They never let me think that they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> enemies, or that I must suspect them and be on the watch against them.

6000|$|... "With Alison it was different," [...] he said. [...] "I never {{understood}} her--even {{when she was}} a child--and I used to look at her and wonder that she <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> daughter. She was moody, intense, with a yearning for affection I've since sometimes thought--she could not express. I did not feel the need of affection in those days, so absorbed was I in building up,--so absorbed and driven, you might say. I suppose I must accept my punishment as just. But the child was always distant with me, and I always remember her in rebellion; a dark little thing with a quivering lip, hair awry, and eyes that flashed through her tears. She would take any amount of punishment rather than admit she had been in the wrong. I recall she had once a fox terrier that never left her, that fought all the dogs in the neighbourhood and destroyed the rugs and cushions in the house. I got rid of it one summer {{when she was a}}t the sea, and I think she never forgave me. The first question she asked when she came home was for that dog--Mischief, his name was--for Mischief. I told her what I had done. It took more courage than I had thought. She went to her room, locked herself in, and stayed there, and we couldn't get her to come out for two days; she wouldn't even eat.|$|E
60|$|At {{the dinner}} his Majesty chatted briskly and entertainingly along in easy and flowing English, {{and now and}} then he {{interrupted}} himself to address a remark to me, or to some other individual of the guests. When the reply had been delivered, he resumed his talk. I noticed that the table etiquette tallied with that which was the law of my house at home when we had guests: that is to say, the guests answered when the host favored them with a remark, and then quieted down and behaved themselves until they got another chance. If I had been in the Emperor's chair and he in mine, I should have felt infinitely comfortable and at home, and should have done a world of talking, and done it well; but I was guest now, and consequently I felt less at home. From old experience, I was familiar with the rules of the game, and familiar with their exercise from the high place of host; but I was not familiar with the trammelled and less satisfactory position of guest, therefore I felt a little strange and out of place. But there was no animosity--no, the Emperor was host, therefore according to my own rule he had a right to do the talking, and it was my honorable duty to intrude no interruptions or other improvements, except upon invitation; and of course it <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>my</b> turn some day: some day, on some friendly visit of inspection to America, it might be my pleasure and distinction to have him as guest at my table; then I would give him a rest, and a remarkably quiet time.|$|E
