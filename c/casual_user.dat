In the past {{it used to}} be easy to use modified consumer grade hardware to operate 802.11 on channels that are outside of the normal FCC allocated frequencies for unlicensed users but still inside an amateur radio band. However, regulatory concerns with the non-authorized use of licensed band frequencies is making it harder. The newer Linux drivers implement [...] that prevents a <b>casual</b> <b>user</b> to operate outside of the country specific operating bands. This requires the use of radio transceivers based on the use of Transverter (or frequency converter) technology.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{its first}} release in September 2008 Chromium {{was criticized for}} storing saved {{passwords}} in a manner so that any <b>casual</b> <b>user</b> of a computer can easily read them from the GUI. Chromium Users have filed many bug reports and feature requests asking for a master password option to access stored passwords, but Chromium developers have consistently insisted that this provides no real security against knowledgeable hackers. Users have argued that it would protect against co-workers or family members borrowing a computer and seeing the stored passwords in clear text. In December 2009, Chromium developer P. Kasting stated: [...] "A master password was issue 1397. That issue is closed. We will not implement a master password. Not now, not ever. Arguing for it won't make it happen. 'A bunch of people would like it' won't make it happen. Our design decisions are not democratic. You cannot always have what you want." ...|$|E

40|$|In a {{traditional}} Business Intelligence (BI) system, power users serve less experienced <b>casual</b> <b>users.</b> Power users analyze {{and gather data}} requested by <b>casual</b> <b>users,</b> and produce the reports and visualizations that <b>casual</b> <b>users</b> base their decisions on. When data volumes and the usage frequency of {{a traditional}} BI system increase, power users have problems serving all the requests from <b>casual</b> <b>users.</b> The Self Service Business Intelligence (SSBI) approach can enable users to be more self-reliant and less dependent on power users. Although SSBI promises more benefits compared to a traditional BI system, many organizations fail to implement SSBI. The literature review {{presented in this paper}} discusses six SSBI challenges related to "Access and use of data" and four challenges related to "Self-reliant users". Awareness of these ten challenges can help practitioners avoid common pitfalls, when implementing SSBI, as well as guide SSBI researchers in focusing on their future research efforts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} WDBQL, {{a visual}} query language intended for <b>casual</b> <b>users.</b> WDBQL is a Web-based query language. It means that WDBQL implements the Web navigational mechanism to query databases. Such a mechanism has two main advantages: (i) the querying process is really {{easy to use}} for <b>casual</b> <b>users</b> and (ii) the querying process hides the semantics of the performed operations. WDBQL allows to query remote relational and objectoriented databases. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Within organisations, Information Systems are characterised by heterogeneity. The main {{management}} {{tools are}} different Relational and Object Oriented DataBase Management Systems. Therefore, variety, complexity {{and lack of}} integration {{make it difficult for}} <b>casual</b> <b>users</b> to query them. This paper presents WDBQS (Web DataBase Query System); a Web-interface for querying distant Relational and Object Oriented DataBases. This system, dedicated to <b>casual</b> <b>users,</b> proposes simple Web mechanisms to navigate through database schemas, build queries and display results. ...|$|R

40|$|Linked Data use has {{expanded}} rapidly in recent years; however {{there is still}} a lack of support for <b>casual</b> <b>users</b> to create complex queries over this Web of Data. Until this occurs, the real benefits of having such rich metadata available will not be realised by the general public. This paper introduces an approach to supporting <b>casual</b> <b>users</b> discover relevant information across multiple Linked Data repositories, by enabling them to leverage and tailor semantic attributes. Semantic attributes are semantically meaningful terms that encapsulate expert rules encoded in multiple formats, including SPARQL. Semantic attributes are created in SABer (Semantic Attribute Builder), which is usable by non-technical domain experts. This opens the approach to almost any domain. A detailed evaluation of SABer is described within this paper, as is a case study that shows how <b>casual</b> <b>users</b> can use semantic attributes to explore multiple structured data sources in the music domain...|$|R

5000|$|Critics of the McCune-Reischauer system {{claim that}} <b>casual</b> <b>users</b> {{of the system}} omit the breves ( [...] Ë˜ [...] ) over the o for [...] and the u for [...] because typing o or u without the breves is often easier than adding them. That can lead to {{confusion}} over whether the o being romanized is [...] or [...] or the u being Romanized is [...] or [...] <b>Casual</b> <b>users</b> also often omit the apostrophe that differentiates aspirated consonants ( [...] , , , and [...] ) from their unaspirated counterparts ( [...] , , , and [...] ), which {{can also lead to}} confusion.|$|R

40|$|The {{currently}} developed {{user language}} interfaces {{of information systems}} are generally intended for serious users. These interfaces commonly ignore potentially the largest user group, i. e., <b>casual</b> <b>users.</b> This project discusses the concepts and implementations of a natural query language system which satisfy the nature and information needs of <b>casual</b> <b>users</b> {{by allowing them to}} communicate with the system in the form of their native (natural) language. In addition, a framework for the development of such an interface is also introduced for the MADAM (Multics Approach to Data Access and Management) system at the University of Southwestern Louisiana...|$|R
40|$|The logic-based machine-understandable {{framework}} of the Semantic Web typically challenges <b>casual</b> <b>users</b> {{when they try to}} query ontologies. An often proposed solution to help <b>casual</b> <b>users</b> is the use of natural language interfaces. Such tools, however, suffer from {{one of the biggest problems}} of natural language: ambiguities. Furthermore, the systems are hardly adaptable to new domains. This paper addresses these issues by presenting Querix, a domain-independent natural language interface for the Semantic Web. The approach allows queries in natural language, thereby asking the user for clarification in case of ambiguities. The preliminary evaluation showed good retrieval performance. ...|$|R

Cognitive Abilities: If the product(software application, website) is {{designed}} for any <b>casual</b> <b>user,</b> then the designer should not expect that all users would be experts, with high cognitive abilities.

50|$|A common {{measure to}} deter {{unauthorized}} users involves hiding the access point's name by disabling the SSID broadcast. While effective against the <b>casual</b> <b>user,</b> it is ineffective {{as a security}} method because the SSID is broadcast in the clear {{in response to a}} client SSID query. Another method is to only allow computers with known MAC addresses to join the network,but determined eavesdroppers may be able to join the network by spoofing an authorized address.|$|E
