Generally the higher {{molecular weight}} for a given class of compounds, the lower volatility and initial concentration but the longer persistence. Some chemicals (typically thiols) have a certain <b>concentration</b> <b>threshold</b> over which the smell is not perceived significantly stronger; therefore a lower-volatility compound is capable of providing comparable stench intensity to a higher-volatility compound, but for longer time. Another issue is the operating temperature, on which the compound's volatility strongly depends.

The processing mode operates similarly as discussed above - fluorescence is observed due to the prevention of competing photoinduced electron transfer reactions from the receptors to the excited anthracene fluorophore. The absence of one, two or all three ion inputs results in a low fluorescence output. Each receptor is selective for its specific ion as an increase in the concentration of the other ions does not yield a high fluorescence.

5000|$|One {{example of}} a {{buffering}} mechanism is protein sequestration, which is a common mechanism found in signalling and regulatory networks. In 2009, Buchler and Cross constructed a synthetic genetic network that was regulated by protein sequestration of a transcriptional activator by a dominant-negative inhibitor. They showed that this system results in a flexibile ultrasensitive response in gene expression. It is flexible in {{that the degree of}} ultrasensitivity can be altered by changing expression levels of the dominant-negative inhibitor. Figure 1 in their article illustrates how an active transcription factor can be sequestered by an inhibitor into the inactive complex AB that is unable to bind DNA. This type of mechanism results in an [...] "all-or-none" [...] response, or ultransensitivy, when the concentration of the regulatory protein increases to the point of depleting the inhibitor. Robust buffering against a response exists below this <b>concentration</b> <b>threshold,</b> and when it is reached any small increase in input is amplified into a large change in output.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} separation {{distances between}} odour sources and residential areas to avoid odour nuisance and complaints by the residents, odour impact criteria OIC {{have to be}} adopted by the responsible authorities. There is {{a wide variety of}} OIC used for this purpose, which differ by the odour <b>concentration</b> <b>threshold</b> (between 0. 12 ouE m- 3 and 10 ouE m- 3), the averaging period (hourly or instantaneous) and by the tolerated exceedance probability of the adopted threshold (between 0. 1 % and about 35 % of the time). There are two groups of OIC used in various jurisdictions: the first one with a low odour <b>concentration</b> <b>threshold</b> and a high tolerated exceedance probability (e. g. Germany); and the second group with a high odour <b>concentration</b> <b>threshold</b> and a low tolerated exceedance probability (e. g. Ireland). The modelled direction-dependent separation distances (using OIC which are supposed to offer the same protection level) can vary significantly. The OIC of the second group, considering higher ambient odour concentrations, show a much lower sensitivity to site-specific meteorological data. Therefore, a higher tolerated exceedance probability seems more appropriate for the determination of OIC. Even if the similarity of separation distances by various OIC could be determined, the direction-dependent separation distances differ considerably for the same protection level for a certain receptor type, e. g. rural residential properties...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMorphogen {{gradients}} {{are thought}} to create <b>concentration</b> <b>thresholds</b> that differentially position the expression boundaries of multiple target genes. Despite intensive study, it is still unclear how the concentration profiles within gradients are spatially related to the critical patterning thresholds they generate. ResultsHere we {{use a combination of}} quantitative measurements and ectopic-misexpression experiments to examine the transcriptional-repression activities of the Hunchback (Hb) protein gradient in Drosophila embryos. Our results define five expression boundaries that are set primarily by differences in Hb concentration and two boundaries that are set by combinatorial mechanisms involving Hb and at least one other repressor. ConclusionsHb functions as a repressive morphogen, but only within a specific range of concentrations (∼ 40 % to ∼ 4. 4 % of maximum Hb concentration), within which there are at least four distinct <b>concentration</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The lower limit of the range reflects a position where the slope of the gradient becomes too shallow for resolution by specific target genes. Concentrations above the upper limit do not contribute directly to differential-repression mechanisms, but they provide a robust source that permits proper functioning of the gradient in heterozygous embryos that contain only one functional hb gene...|$|R

40|$|Extracorporeal {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation (ECPR) allows clinicians to potentially rescue pediatric patients unresponsive to traditional {{cardiopulmonary resuscitation}} (CPR). Clinical and laboratory variables predictive of survival to hospital discharge {{are beginning to}} emerge. In this retrospective, historical cohort case series, clinical, and laboratory data from 31 pediatric patients (< 21  years of age) receiving ECPR from March 2000 to April 2006 at our university-affiliated, tertiary-care children’s hospital were statistically analyzed {{in an attempt to}} identify variables predictive of survival to hospital discharge. Seven patients survived to hospital discharge (23 %), and 24 patients died. Survival was independent of gender, age, and CPR duration. ECPR survival was, however, associated with a lower pre-ECPR phosphorus concentration (P =  0. 002) and a lower pre-ECPR creatinine concentration (P =  0. 05). A classification tree analysis, using, in part, a pre-ECPR phosphorus <b>concentration</b> <b>threshold</b> and a CPR ABG base excess <b>concentration</b> <b>threshold,</b> yielded a 96 % nominal accuracy of predicting survival to hospital discharge or death. A large, multicenter, prospective cohort study aimed at validating these predictive variables is needed to guide appropriate ECPR patient selection.

40|$|Abstract Studying {{airborne}} pollen concentrations is {{an essential}} part of aerobiology owing to its important applications in allergology. A time-varying first order autoregressive (AR(1)) model able to describe the annual cycle of both the expectation and variance as well as the highly skewed probability distribution of daily ragweed pollen concentrations conditioned on previous-day pollen concentration values is developed. Confidence bands for forecasts obtained with these conditional lognormal distri-butions are analysed. The probability of exceeding specific pollen <b>concentration</b> <b>thresholds</b> is also addressed with the model based on a refinement of the AutoRegressive To Anything process. In order to have more accurate forecasts for the next-day pollen concentration level, eight meteoro-logical variables influencing pollen concentrations are considered. Based on a procedure similar to the stepwise regression method, only one predictor has been retained, namely the daily mean temperature. Using root mean square error, the percentage variance of the ragweed pollen concentration level accounted for by this extended AR(1) model is 53. 5 %, while the mean absolute error produced by the model is 32. 2 pollen grains m− 3. The probability of exceeding pollen <b>concentration</b> <b>thresholds</b> obtained from the conditional lognormal distributions under the extended AR(1) model fits well the observed exceedance events. ...|$|R

40|$|Hunger/satiation state {{interacts with}} appetitive and noxious stimuli to {{determine}} feeding and avoidance responses. In the predatory marine snail Pleurobranchaea californica, food chemostimuli induced proboscis extension and biting at <b>concentration</b> <b>thresholds</b> that varied directly with satiation state. However, food stimuli {{also tended to}} elicit avoidance behavior (withdrawal and avoidance turns) at <b>concentration</b> <b>thresholds</b> that were relatively low and fixed. When the feeding threshold for active feeding (proboscis extension with biting) was exceeded, ongoing avoidance and locomotion were interrupted and suppressed. Noxious chemostimuli usually stimulated avoidance, but, in animals with lower feeding thresholds for food stimuli, they often elicited feeding behavior. Thus, sensory pathways mediating appetitive and noxious stimuli may have dual access to neural networks of feeding and avoidance behavior, but their final effects are regulated by satiation state. These observations suggest that a simple cost-benefit computation regulates behavioral switching in the animal's foraging behavior, where food stimuli above or below the incentive level for feeding tend to induce feeding or avoidance, respectively. This decision mechanism can weigh the animal's need for nutrients against the potential risk from other predators {{and the cost of}} relative energy outlay in an attack on prey. Stimulation of orienting and attack by low-level noxious stimuli in the hungriest animals may reflect risk-taking that can enhance prey capture success. A simple, hedonically structured neural network model captures this computation...|$|R
