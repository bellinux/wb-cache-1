5|$|According to the {{historian}} A.D. Lee, {{there is little}} evidence to support this view and compelling reasons to reject it. Firstly, the late army <b>clearly</b> <b>was</b> not, and did not become, ineffective. The regular army in the West remained a formidable force until the political disintegration of the West in mid-5th century and continued to win most of its major encounters with barbarian forces e.g. the defeat of Radagaisus in 405. In any case, the Eastern empire did not collapse, even though its army probably contained at least the same proportion of barbarians as the West, if not greater. An analysis of the ethnicity of Roman army officers named in the sources shows that in the period 350–99, 23% were probably barbarian-born. The same figure for period 449–76 officers, virtually all Easterners (as the Western army had largely dissolved) was 31%. In the Notitia, 55 Eastern regiments carry barbarian names, compared with 25 in the Western army.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{began as}} a tropical wave—a westbound low-pressure area—first observed southeast of Cape Verde on 29August. Traversing the tropical Atlantic, the wave retained a minimum barometric pressure of about 1010mbar (hPa; 29.83inHg) and strengthened briefly the following day. By 1September, however, the wave had become rather weak and indiscernible; it would remain as such for much of its early existence until 6September, by which time it had moved past the Windward Islands. In this region the system became sufficiently organised to be classified as a tropical depression at 18:00UTC that same day near Grenada. Some six hours after its inception the depression strengthened to a tropical storm over the eastern Caribbean Sea. Owing {{to a lack of}} ship observations, data on the storm were scarce in that region. The first ship to identify the storm <b>clearly</b> <b>was</b> the tanker Geo H. Jones, which recorded strong winds in conjunction with rapidly decreasing barometric pressures late on 7 September. As the storm remained west-northwest bound across the Caribbean, more ships were able to record data on the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|With Merrick {{admitted}} into the hospital, Treves now {{had time to}} conduct a more thorough examination. He discovered that Merrick's physical condition had deteriorated over {{the previous two years}} and that he had become quite crippled by his deformities. Treves also suspected that Merrick now suffered from a heart condition and that he had only a few years left to live. Merrick's general health improved over the next five months under the care of the hospital staff. Although some nurses were initially upset by his appearance, they overcame this and cared for him. The problem of his unpleasant odour was mitigated through frequent bathing and Treves gradually developed an understanding of Merrick's speech. A new set of photographs was taken. The question of Merrick's long-term care had to be addressed. Francis Carr Gomm, the chairman of the hospital committee, had supported Treves in his decision to admit Merrick, but by November, long-term plans needed to be made. The London Hospital was not equipped or staffed to provide care for the incurable, which Merrick <b>clearly</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E

When first-class cricket resumed in 1919, Hearne was fifty-two and <b>clearly</b> <b>was</b> too old to play a full season's cricket. He played two more first-class matches against weak opponents in 1921 and 1923, but never again in the Championship.|$|E
25|$|Robert Hichens (1939). That Which Is Hidden (London: Cassell & Company). U.S. Edition: New York: Doubleday, Doran & Company, 1940. The novel {{opens with}} the protagonist visiting {{the tomb of}} a famed Austrian sex expert, Dr. R. Ellendorf, in a {{cemetery}} in Nice. At the tomb, he meets the late doctor's protégé, a Chinese student named Kho Ling. The character of Ling refers {{to the memory of}} his mentor at numerous points in the novel.

25|$|According to Thomas Powers, {{the author}} of Diana: The Making of a Terrorist, the more Oughton learned about the hard life of rural Guatemala, the more she {{reflected}} on the affluence of the United States. In Chichicastenango, Americans seemed an alien presence; the fact of their wealth was almost {{an insult to the}} impoverished Indians. In her mind, confusion emerged that lasted the rest of her life: she had rejected affluence (at first almost unconsciously) to work among the poor, but poverty, <b>clearly,</b> <b>was</b> nothing to be envied. She hated poverty, but she hated affluence, too. Oughton left Chichicastenango with a new view of the problems that undeveloped countries like Guatemala faced when in struggle with the United States.|$|E

500|$|In early 1795, {{intervention}} by French revolutionary forces {{led to the}} downfall of the old Dutch Republic. The new Republic enjoyed widespread support from the Dutch population and was the product of a genuine popular revolution. Nevertheless, it <b>clearly</b> <b>was</b> founded with the armed support of the revolutionary French Republic. The Batavian Republic became a client state, the first of the [...] "sister-republics" [...] and later part of the French Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte, and its politics were deeply influenced by the French who supported no fewer than three coups d'état to bring the different political factions to power that France favored at different moments in its own political development. Nevertheless, the process of creating a written Dutch constitution was mainly driven by internal political factors, not by French influence, until Napoleon forced the Dutch government to accept his brother as monarch.|$|E
500|$|Frazer (2004) {{notes that}} while Adams shared many {{perspectives}} with deists, [...] "Adams <b>clearly</b> <b>was</b> not a deist. Deism rejected {{any and all}} supernatural activity and intervention by God; consequently, deists {{did not believe in}} miracles or God's providence....Adams, however, did believe in miracles, providence, and, to a certain extent, the Bible as revelation." [...] Frazer further argues that Adams' [...] "theistic rationalism, like that of the other Founders, was a sort of middle ground between Protestantism and deism." [...] By contrast, David L. Holmes has argued that Adams, beginning as a Congregationalist, ended his days as a Christian Unitarian, accepting central tenets of the Unitarian creed, but also accepting Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical account of his miracles as true. Like many of his Protestant contemporaries, Adams criticized the claims to universal authority made by the Catholic Church. In 1796, Adams denounced political opponent Thomas Paine's deistic criticisms of Christianity in The Age of Reason, saying, [...] "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will." ...|$|E

500|$|Piyush Mathur {{reviewed}} {{the work for}} Asia Times Online, a joint Thai-Hong Kongese publication. Praising the book, Mathur argued that by being a U.S. citizen {{who was willing to}} criticise his own government, Chomsky was showing [...] "a way beyond parochialism" [...] that avoided nationalistic or ethnocentric intentions. Highlighting Chomsky's [...] "wry humor and sarcasm", he notes that the author [...] "successfully shows that the American emperor, while preaching modesty to the rest, himself struts about rather ostentatiously." [...] Mathur also {{turned his attention to the}} most prominent press reviews of the book that appeared in the U.S. and U.K., those of Power and Cohen. He argues that the former's review was [...] "hardly charitable", and that she had narrowly framed Hegemony or Survival as a critique purely of the Bush administration, something Mathur stated it <b>clearly</b> <b>was</b> not. Turning to Cohen's [...] "venomous" [...] review, he highlights that it actually dealt very little with Chomsky's book, instead offering a diatribe against the Left, one which consisted of a [...] "thoroughly convoluted vagueness". Ultimately, Mathur notes that the [...] "strangely defensive and rather parochial posture" [...] adopted by Power and Cohen was [...] "entirely in line" [...] with the reception that Chomsky had received from the Anglo-American world.|$|E
500|$|The {{managing}} editor, Sam Moskowitz, {{also had}} a long history in the field, having helped organize the First World Science Fiction Convention in 1939. [...] He too had strong views about what constituted good science fiction, though his views did not always coincide with those of his publisher: Gernsback's focus was on the educational potential of sf, while Moskowitz was a fan of the early writers in the field, from before the Golden Age. [...] Moskowitz was the one in charge of obtaining stories, and he succeeded in acquiring work by many of the best-known names in sf, including Clifford Simak, Murray Leinster, Robert Bloch, James H. Schmitz, and Philip José Farmer, but he also bought many stories by writers from {{the early years of the}} genre, such as Raymond Gallun, Eando Binder, and Harry Bates. [...] The result was a magazine that both Ashley and fellow sf historian Donald Lawler describe as old-fashioned, despite its smart appearance: in Ashley's words, Science-Fiction Plus had [...] "a feeling of archaism", and he adds [...] "for a magazine to be 'slick', it didn't just have to look slick, it had to feel it, but in the case of Science-Fiction Plus all that glittered <b>clearly</b> <b>was</b> not gold". [...] Lawler agrees, describing the magazine as [...] "an anachronism", and [...] "dull from first to last". [...] As part of Gernsback's attempt to encourage stories that contained plausible scientific predictions, he created a symbol made up of a sphere labeled [...] "SF", with a five-pointed star atop it. [...] He placed the first of these awards on a story of his own, [...] "Exploration of Mars", in the first issue, in what Lawler describes as [...] "a characteristic self-tribute".|$|E

2500|$|Another {{religious}} house possibly {{founded by}} Fergus was the abbey of Soulseat, a Premonstratensian house seated near Stranraer. Walter Bower and the necrologies certainly state as such.

If Máel Máedoc and Fergus met during the former's apparent stay in Cruggleton, it is conceivable that Fergus granted him the lands upon which he founded a religious house at Soulseat. If Máel Máedoc indeed founded a Cistercian house on this site, it <b>clearly</b> <b>was</b> converted to a Premonstratensian monastery not long afterwards.|$|E
