40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore the relationship between <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> and accuracy of perception of cognitive development in parents of children with neural tube defect. <b>Chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> was defined as the cyclical, recurring grief that occurs after {{the birth of a child}} with a disability. Accuracy of perception was the difference between parental judgement of child performance and a standard measure of development. Potential influence by parent and child variables was explored. ^ The sample consisted of 132 parents (63 mother/father pairs and six single parents) and 69 children aged 7 to 75 months. All parents responded to developmental, sorrow, and depression instruments. Developmental questions preceded the sorrow and depression instruments. Children were tested for cognitive level. ^ Both mothers and fathers were inaccurate in their perceptions of cognitive development and demonstrated <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow.</b> Multiple regression revealed no statistically significant relationships for mothers between <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> and accuracy of perception. Fathers demonstrated statistically significant relationships for two of the four sorrow measures. ^ Multivariate analysis of variance demonstrated significant differences between mothers and fathers in <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow.</b> Paired t-test demonstrated significant differences between parents for accuracy. Mothers were more accurate and had more <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> than fathers. ^ The data were also analyzed to determine the potential effect of parent or child related variables. Neither parent (depression, education, knowledge of development) nor child (age, sex, level of lesion) related variables significantly affected the relationship between accuracy and sorrow. The results indicate that mothers and fathers differ in their expression of sorrow and accuracy. ^ The findings of this study emphasize the need for individual assessments of parental coping styles, accuracy, and expression of sorrow. Plans and interventions should consider the multidimensional nature of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> and its potential effect on paternal accuracy. ...|$|E
40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{can cause}} many emotions, {{including}} grief {{and a sense}} of isolation for both the person with PD (referred to as Parkinsonian) and their partner. Such ongoing grief and emotional turmoil can be termed <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow.</b> The aim of this research is to present accounts of partners’ perspectives, analysed in the context of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> theory, to offer health professionals an insight into the impact of non-motor PD symptoms on partners. METHODS: A group of partners of Parkinsonians provided the data through individual stories. These stories were ubjected to thematic analysis, using a seven-step process leading to the establishment of themes. Caregiver burden and <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> is not related to providing physical care, but the emotional care of attempting to minimise the effect of PD, coping with disturbance to sleep, and helping the Parkinsonian to maintain as much independence as possible.

40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} grieving, coping and {{resiliency}} experiences {{of parents of}} children with cerebral palsy (CP) and to investigate the suitability of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> theory as a framework to understand those experiences. Methods: This study combined focus groups with a web-based cross-sectional survey to explore <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> in {{parents of children with}} CP. Eight parents of children with CP participated in focus groups. The discussion was transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was performed. A further 94 parents participated in the web-based survey study in which they completed the Adapted Burke Questionnaire on <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow.</b> A content analysis of responses was used to confirm the primary qualitative analysis. Results: The reports of parents in the focus group were consistent with <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> theory, as were the responses of parents to the web-based survey. Some parents found the diagnosis itself a distressing time whereas others found it a relief. Parents reported that times of medical and allied health intervention were particularly challenging. Conclusion: Chronic sorry theory is a useful way of understanding the experiences of parents of children with CP. It is recommended that health practitioners are mindful that, even years after diagnosis, parents of children with CP may experience intensified <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> symptoms following a triggering event and that this is normal...|$|E
40|$|M. Cur. Schizophrenia is {{a devastating}} {{mental illness and}} {{probably}} the most distressing and disabling mental disorder. It is not {{the condition of the}} ill person alone but also of the family which is placed in a crucial and pivotal role and which must take care of the ill relative with schizophrenia. This is so because of the disillusional thinking, altered thought process and distractions of internal stimuli that may interfere with the planning, commitment and rationale for actions, making it difficult for everyone involved. The effects of the illness may be confusing and shocking to families. Parents suffer from great disruptions to their lives and children can struggle with the implications of having a parent suffering from schizophrenia. Siblings of the ill person suffering from chronic schizophrenia are not spared, they even suffer because issues of their own survivorship. The family becomes case managers and primary carers. Family caregivers are vulnerable to emotional manipulation by their mentally ill relative. They are rarely trained/helped to manage difficult circumstances. The family members are called upon for provision of psychological and social therapies, occupational and recreational therapy and attendant care for which they are not trained. The family is also seriously affected and distressed because of the effect schizophrenia has on their relative and the burden of caring. Coping with schizophrenia can especially be difficult for relatives who remember their relative before he or she became ill, giving rise to <b>chronic</b> grieving and <b>sorrow</b> and because of the cyclic nature of schizophrenia giving no definite end point or lengthy respite to complete mourning. The reminders of the "might have been" can be distressing. There is an obvious need for research on the family's experience. It is essential to understand their emotional tones and specific needs in relation to living with a member suffering from chronic schizophrenia as well as to formulate guidelines. The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore and describe family member's experiences and to formulate guidelines of care for families living with a member with chronic schizophrenia. The research design was based on qualitative research because of its explorative descriptive and contextual nature. Data were collected by means of indepth phenomenological interviews and naïve sketches. Field notes were written for reflecting upon methods used and the personal notes for the researcher's personal inflections. Literature was used to compare and complement the results.

40|$|This study {{explored}} the phenomena of being pregnant {{and becoming a}} mother {{for the first time}} following repeated in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments (≥ 3). Readings of Martin Heidegger and Hans-Georg Gadamer provided the hermeneutic phenomenology method, a foundation {{in order to understand the}} extraordinary experience of pregnancy and matre-scence for these New Zealand women. The seven study participants were all women who had experienced repeated assisted reproductive technologies including IVF. Of the seven women six had experienced pregnancy loss directly related to previous IVF treatments. The pregnancy losses, such as nine miscarriages for one woman and another a stillbirth at 37 weeks gestation, culminated in a sense of <b>chronic</b> grief and <b>sorrow.</b> During the first interview, between 28 - 30 weeks gestation, all of the participants spent significant time detailing their infertility experience. This demonstrated that the past had to be understood before the pregnancy experience could be explored. The participants’ interviews, of which there were two for each woman, were digitally recorded and narratives of their experience were crafted from the recordings and validated by the women to have captured the unique experience. It is these stories that have uncovered the everyday reality of how it is to finally be pregnant and become a mother after enduring years of emotional and physical pain, compounded by financial burdening of treatment costs. The need to procreate, to belong in the mother-world and the fear of failing are dominant themes that drive the need for repeated treatment, even when required to self-fund. These women have demonstrated tenacity, losing previous pregnancies yet finding the courage to try again, to face another loss but to still try again and eventually to journey through pregnancy and the transition to motherhood. The findings suggest that these women traverse their pregnancy experiencing a variety of moods. The mood of dread is the overwhelming mood as they endeavour to balance the effect of fear and the flame of hope. The women have become efficient at applying coping mechanisms such as the use of silence, or pretending to be what they perceive to be ‘normal’ pregnant or mothering women. As they transition to motherhood the shroud of fear for some wraps around the mother and newborn, yet for others over time they are able to shed the shroud and embrace motherhood. The time to transition to motherhood is experienced differently for all women, with two of the women unable to find the equilibrium of ‘ease’ of motherhood at 10 weeks postnatal. This study uncovered that for these women who experienced years of infertility, treatments and failures, their pregnancy and matrescence experience is one of not-being-at-home-in-the-world...|$|R

40|$|Grief is {{a central}} {{experience}} by people diagnosed with mental illness, families, and friends. <b>Chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> is defined as pervasive sadness and/or other emotional reactions commonly associated with grief that is permanent, periodic and potentially progressive in nature. It {{is viewed as a}} normal reaction to loss that may be to a single event or ongoing. During the experience of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow,</b> people feel emotional commotion, discomfort, & hopelessness. It may progress to pathological grief or depression. It may also trigger some of the psychiatric disorders in individuals who are vulnerable. No documented study in Uganda has addressed the problem of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> among caregivers of patients with mental illness. Objective The theory of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> was used to guide this study. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore the experience of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> among caregivers of patients with schizophrenia in Uganda. Methodology This study employed a descriptive qualitative design using Focus Groups and In-depth interviews. The research was carried out at Butabika National Mental Hospital in Kampala. The study was conducted in Luganda. There were 10 in-depth interviews and 2 focused group discussions. The sample size was based on the principle of data saturation and purposive sampling technique was used. The caregivers who met the inclusion criteria, consented and were interviewed using the <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> questionnaire guide (caregiver version). The interviews were recorded, transcribed, translated to English and analyzed through content analysis of a framework by Graneheim & Lundman (2004). Results 9 out of 10 caregivers experienced <b>Chronic</b> <b>Sorrow.</b> The triggers identified were, unending care giving, change in behavior (refusal to take drugs, refusal to go to hospital), management of crises (during relapse and side sides of drugs), society reaction to mental illness (abandoning and mistreating patients, discrimination) and missed companionship. Unhelpful factors were poor communication by health workers, stigma from community, Uncooperative iii police. The coping strategies used were, interpersonal strategies, action oriented activities (keeping busy), positive thinking, avoidance, emotional (crying). Caregivers indicated that health workers should show understanding, communicate properly, and provide information, facts about mental illness to them and community. Taking mental health services nearer to the people throughout the country and follow up visits were also suggested. Conclusions. Caregivers of patients with schizophrenia are most likely to have <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow,</b> the sadness and the grief related feelings are triggered by different factors which can be internal or external. Effective coping strategies are needed to be used by the caregivers in order to help them keep up with the task of caregiving and health workers have a great role to play...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to create a}} {{professional}} development for school personal which would increase their understanding of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow,</b> the parental experience of raising a child with special needs and family-centered practice. To gather information for the training, research literature was reviewed which explored the educational partnerships between school staff and families, looking specifically at families who have children with special needs and the roles that these partnerships may play in creating stressors that trigger states of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow.</b> Findings from the research showed that educators??? current perceptions of the <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> process and understanding of the parental experience, as it relates to raising a child with special needs, were extremely limited (Bringham & Abernathy, 2007; Mandell & Murray, 2009). The research further suggested that a family-centered model of practice serves as the best model for parents, children and staff. However, educators??? understanding (including those of teachers and administrators) of this model of service is often limited or incorrect (Bringham & Abernathy, 2007; Dunst, Boyd, Trivette & Hamby, 2002; Espe-Sherwindt, 2008; Mandell & Murray, 2009). Clearly, the finding from the research strongly supported the need for a professional development which would increase educators awareness of both the parental experience and family-centered practice.

40|$|The {{focus and}} purpose of the this {{qualitative}} study is to describe parental experiences across the life cycle following the diagnosis of significant disability in their child {{and the concept of}} <b>Chronic</b> <b>Sorrow</b> described by Olshansky (1962). The study also hoped to provide avenues of expanding the Family Life Cycle theory (Carter and McGoldrick, 1988), The Contextual Approach to Family Stress Theory (Boss, 2002) and Ambiguous Loss (Boss, 1999, 2006) to become more inclusive for families who have a child with significant disabilities. Discussion surrounding Family Systems Illness Model (Rolland, 1994) and Experiential Family Therapy (Whitaker, 1989) were also included to provide understanding regarding the adaptations made by families and the use of Experiential Family Therapy with this particular family system to promote continued growth across the life cycle. Purposeful and Snowball sampling methods were used to contact 10 families living in the North Texas. Participants were asked to engage in audiotaped face to face interviews with the primary researcher. Responses to the research question and central prompts were transcribed from the audiotaped interviews and entered into a Word document for the purpose of coding. The coded data was studied and nine primary themes were identified. These primary themes were: (1) reaction to the diagnosis, (2) barriers (medical and informational), (3) adjustment (spousal, family, siblings, extended family), (4) resiliency, (5) supports (extended family and community), (6) hope, (7) future, (8) <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow,</b> (9) individual adjustment. These primary themes were then compared to those developed by Boss (1999, 2006) in her depiction of Ambiguous Loss. Adaptations to these themes were decided and were condensed into seven final themes: (1) The Initial Reaction of <b>Chronic</b> <b>Sorrow</b> to the Diagnosis, (2) Finding Meaning in an Overwhelming Situation, (3) Tempering Mastering of Parenting a Child with a Disability, (4) Normalizing the Ambivalence of Parenting, (5) Parents Restructure their Identity, (6) Discovering Hope in the Redefined Family, and (7) Ambivalence about the Future. This study discovered through the interviews with the parent participants that the experience of <b>Chronic</b> <b>Sorrow</b> began soon after receiving the diagnosis of significant disability for their child even though they did not have a term to describe the sense of loss being experienced. Parents in this study experienced multiple changes in their ideas regarding the diagnosis of disability, understanding the role of parenting and lifelong caregiver, involvement and connection of extended family and the decisions surrounding the future for the parent as an individual and for the child as they aged. <b>Chronic</b> <b>Sorrow</b> was found to be an experience that lasts across the life cycle, it is not a time bound concept, nor does it resemble a grieving process which has been associated with the loss of a loved one. <b>Chronic</b> <b>Sorrow</b> shares some similar components with Ambiguous Loss, and could be considered a Chronic Stressor as described in the Contextual Model of Family Stress Theory (Boss, 2006). The study also provided possible inclusive adaptations to the Family Life Cycle Theory (Carter and McGoldrick, 1988) to include the disability diagnoses into the theory of the life cycle as well as adding an addition component to the theory that includes the process of the launching the child back into the home after school servicers have ended.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{increase}} our understanding and knowledge of patients’ experiences of living with multiple sclerosis (MS). A mixed-method design was used, including both qualitative and quantitative methods. Thirty-one immunologically treated MS patients were randomly selected and matched with patients without immunological treatment. Matching criteria were gender, impairment, time since diagnosis and age. One patient dropped out and therefore the final sample consisted of 61 patients. All 61 were interviewed (Studies I, III and IV) and completed the 36 -item Short Form health survey questionnaire (SF- 36), the Subjective estimation of Quality of Life questionnaire (SQoL), the Self-reported Impairment Check-list (SIC) (Study II) and the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale questionnaire (MADRS) (Study III). The interviews were subjected to content analysis. Initial symptoms and being diagnosed with MS were {{described in terms of}} becoming vulnerable and remaining in that vulnerability long after the diagnosis. Eventually the patients were able to manage this emotional distress and acquired strength in their illness situation (Study I). In the matched analysis, 29 pairs of patients were included after internal drop-out. There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment and control groups. Concerning the total group of 61 patients, the self-reported impairment check-list showed that they had various problems of impairment, most evident in balance and walking. The score on health-related quality of life (SF- 36) was reduced, disclosing a negative influence on vitality, physical role and function. However, subjective quality of life (SQoL) was not reduced, showing that the patients estimated their well-being to be quite unaffected (Study II). Thirty-eight of the 61 patients (62 %) experienced <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> (Study III). The group were not depressed in general, only four having mild symptoms of depression, revealing that <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> is a particular form of emotional distress in MS. <b>Chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> was experienced in terms of loss of hope, loss of control over the body and loss of integrity and dignity. When the patients could not adequately manage their sorrow and lacked support, they were struggling with their vulnerability.

40|$|This {{quantitative}} and qualitative study explores the importance of timing {{in the delivery of}} the support services that affect the psychosocial health of primary family caregivers of dementia patients. Caregivers’ narratives and survey responses reflect their feelings about the impact the experience of caregiving has on their emotional, physical, and mental health as they struggle to manage the stressors of dealing with a patient’s physical care, as well as the additional medical, legal, financial, spiritual, and emotional tasks associated with end-of-life issues. The purpose of exploring the importance of timing in the delivery of support services is to ascertain if the caregivers feel that they experience reductions in the negative emotional response (<b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow)</b> engendered by these stressors if they are provided with services early in the caregiving process. The participants in the study indicate that they feel it is important to receive support services early and often {{during the course of the}} caregiving process.

Further, the notion of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> is often applied in order to describe parents and/or families as either 2 ̆ 2 in denial 2 ̆ 2 or too aggrieved to enact their therapeutic imperative, and individualised and psychologised interpretations are made. Service delivery in early childhood settings often reinforces [...] rather than acts to reduce [...] social, cultural and economic injustices. Clearly then, childhood disability remains institutionalised, but just within the institution of the family. Attention to the largely silenced, yet multiple, shifting, and complex issues faced by families living with childhood disability is required and will likely have implications for early childhood service delivery...|$|E
40|$|Aim. This paper {{reports on}} a study {{exploring}} parents’ longer-term experiences of having a child with type 1 diabetes. Background. Parents of children with type 1 diabetes may experience a grief reaction at diagnosis similar to that normally associated with bereavement, but {{little is known about}} their long-term emotional adaptation. <b>Chronic</b> <b>sorrow,</b> a sustained but intermittent grief reaction, is identified in adults with diabetes but has not previously been explored in relation to parents. Methodology. In-depth interviews were conducted in 2007 with a convenience sample of 17 parents of children with type 1 diabetes 7 – 10 years after diagnosis. Data were explored within a theoretical framework of grief, loss, adaptation, and change. Findings. Parents had adapted to the needs of diabetes management but most had not ‘come to terms’ with the diagnosis. They experienced a resurgence of grief at critical times during their child’s development and some, particularly mothers, became upset during their interviews, even though these took place 7 – 10 years after their child’s diagnosis. Mothers elaborated more on their emotions than fathers, but continuing feelings associated with grief, such as anger and guilt, were expressed by both fathers and mothers. Conclusion. Greater understanding of parents’ long-term emotional responses and recognition that grief may never resolve in these parents may enable healthcare professionals to provide appropriate and timely support at critical time...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{report an}} {{analysis}} of the concept of grief in mothers of children with addiction. Background. The concept of grief in this context is poorly understood and often synonymously used with concepts depression, loss and <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow.</b> In the US, the core concept grief has been recently revised by both NANDA and the DSM-V in efforts to better understand and characterize the concept. The plethora of literature on grief worldwide often characterizes grief as a response to a death. Design. Concept analysis. Data sources. Search terms ‘parental grief’ and ‘substance abuse’ yielded 30 articles. A second review using terms ‘grief’ and ‘substance abuse’ yielded 323 articles, in PsychInfo, CINAHL, PubMed databases from 1980 – 2013. Limits for articles in English and for the terms ‘death’ and ‘child’ yielded 13 usable articles. Methods. The hybrid model of concept analysis, using a theoretical phase, an empirical phase and a final phase when a clarified definition of grief emerged. Results. Definitions in the literature and defining characteristics of grief outline bio-psycho-social aspects of the concept. For one mother grief was accompanied by recurring feelings of sadness across time, while for the other mother grief was seen as coping, after having passed through a variety of stages of grief. For both, grief was seen to fall on a continuum. Conclusions. Grief is a universal concept and has a trajectory. Case study data have been essential in clarifying understandings of grief as experienced by mothers of addicted children and will provide direction for meaningful and tailored interventions...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{grief is}} a normal {{response}} to lost, and can be persistant in parents of sick children, or acute when a dear person is lost. In this paper, the theoretical model of chronic grief is presented, a model that gives an alternative way to observe and react to experience of pain (grief and sorrow). While treating the medical condition of the patients, {{it is important to}} pay attention to his emotional condition, too. The concept of loneliness is connected to the theory oft he chronic grief, because the key component oft he loneliness and chronic grief is a lost. The theory of the chronic grief gives the guidelines to understanding and work with individuals who survived the important loss. Situation and circumstances that cause chronic grief and loneliness are identified and methods of management of chronic grief, considered as useful are described in this paper. The research on chronic grief includes qualitative methods, such as interviews face-to-face, or by phone, Burke/NCRCS questionnaire on chronic gried, instrument for evaluation of chronic grief by Kendall (Kendall <b>Chronic</b> <b>Sorrow</b> Instrument, KCSI), which has 18 parts and is designed to observe and measure the experience of chronic grief. The results have demonstrated that KCSI is valid and reliable, and adds to quantitative research on chronic grief. Empirical dana give means to ensure measurability of the defined atributes of loneliness. Modernization of society, technical and biomedical achievements, faster life style, loss of communication lead to loneliness and alienation. Future research should be focused on finding efficient internal methods of chronic grief management...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{illuminate}} the meaning of parental care-giving with reference to having an adult son or daughter with severe mental illness living in a care setting. The parents were asked to narrate their relationship to offspring in the past, in the present, and their thoughts and feelings concerning the future. The study was guided by a phenomenological hermeneutic perspective. The meaning of parental care was illuminated in the themes ‘living with sorrow, anguish and constant worry’, ‘living with guilt and shame’, ‘relating with carer/care; comfort and hardships ’ ‘coming to terms with difficulties ’ and ‘hoping for a better life for the adult child’. Parental care-giving emerged as a life-long effort. The narratives revealed ongoing grief, sorrow and losses interpreted as <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow.</b> The narratives disclosed a cultural conflict between the family system and the care system, which was interpreted as a threat to the parental role, but also experiences of receiving comfort and having confidence in the care given. Experiences of stigma were interpreted from the way of labelling illness, narrated experiences of shame and relations with the public and mental health professionals. Parents ’ persisting in the care-giving role, striving to look after themselves and expressing hopes for the future were interpreted as a process of coming to terms with difficulties. Results suggest that mental health professionals need to be aware of their own attitudes and treatment of families, improve their cooperation with, and support to families, and provide opportunities for family members to meet one another...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Stepping Stones Triple P (SSTP) {{is a new}} {{parenting}} intervention {{designed specifically}} for {{parents of children with}} disabilities to help them develop effective management strategies for dealing with childhood behaviour problems and developmental issues. Aims: This present study aimed to investigate the acceptability of SSTP by parents of children with cerebral palsy (CP) and health professionals working with children with CP, to explore parents’ experience in parenting their child with CP, and to assess parental <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> and types of coping strategies employed by this population. Furthermore, this study also aimed to delineate the types of daily parenting tasks that parents of children with CP perform in comparison to parents of typically developing children so as to develop an outcome measure of parenting tasks for this population. Method: Design: Qualitative study via focus groups (Study I) and quantitative study via online survey (Study II). Participants: For Study I, participants were eight parents of children with CP and five health professionals. For Study II, participants were 61 parents of children with CP and 32 parents of typically developing children serving as a comparison group. Measures: Questionnaires for Study I include the Family Background Questionnaire, Expert Focus Group Demographic Sheet, and Parenting Strategies Questionnaire. Questionnaires for Study II include the Family Background Questionnaire, Adapted Burke Questionnaire, Coping Health Inventory for Parents, Cerebral Palsy Daily Parenting Tasks Checklist, Parents’ Acceptability of Stepping Stones Triple P Questionnaire, and Parenting Experience Questionnaire. Procedures: For Study I, two parent focus groups and one health professional focus group were conducted in which participants viewed video footages of parenting strategies from SSTP. Parents rated the parenting strategies on a 10 -point Likert Scale for acceptability, usability and intention to use the strategies. Focus group discussions were subsequently conducted to draw detailed information from both parent and professionals in accordance with the study aims. For Study II, parents completed questionnaires via an online survey website regarding their parenting experiences and the acceptability of SSTP. Data arising from Study I was analysed thematically and data from Study II was analysed statistically using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Results: Overall, participants’ responses to SSTP were positive and they rated each of the SSTP parenting strategy highly in terms of acceptability, usability, and behavioural intention (ratings between 78 th and 89 th percentile for Study I), {{as well as on the}} program as a whole (at the 65 th percentile for Study II). Parents of children with CP were found to have a moderate level of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> in Study II (M= 9. 23, SD= 5. 58; maximum intensity score possible = 24). Key themes of the parenting experiences arising from Study I within this population included chronic grief for lost opportunities, sadness, helplessness, and frustration. Nevertheless, strong themes of resiliency and positive attitude were also found, with parents reporting that whilst parenting a child with CP was demanding and stressful, it was also fulfilling. Key coping strategies used by this population included obtaining support from their partner, family, and friends; positive thinking; talking with other parents of children with disabilities; eating comfort food, and reading encouraging quotations. Significant differences were found between parents of children with CP and parents of typically developing children such that the former reported having increased number of applicable daily parenting tasks (t (84. 99) = 8. 93,...|$|E
40|$|The {{physical}} and financial demands {{of caring for}} a child with complex needs are acknowledged by health professionals. However the emotional needs of parents are not often recognised by health professionals until parents are at a heightened level of stress. This paper {{is based on a}} literature review of current articles, research papers and government documentation. The focus is on how health professionals, and nurses in particular should meet the emotional needs of parents who have child with complex needs, particularly at the point of diagnosis. Giving birth to a child with severe health problems impacts upon parents at an emotional time of transition, particularly if there were no concerns identified during pregnancy. For some parents a grief response or state of <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> may be triggered. The reality of caring for a baby who is critically ill or disabled can be an enormous and unexpected shock for both parents. Parents need emotional support and guidance, as they may have to change their expectations for their child’s development and even life span. Primary support often comes from parent support groups rather than health professionals. The review discusses how home visits, practical help and early support can all help to alleviate stress. It is important for nurses to realise that if parents’ emotional needs are unmet they can lead to clinical depression or mental illness. This literature review looks at the emotional impact on parents and explores how nurses can address this issue in order to support parents more effectively. It identifies key areas that nurses could address that would help alleviate parents’ emotional stress...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{aim of the}} licentiate thesis was to {{elucidate}} the meaning of living with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in people with TBI and their close relatives. The data were collected by means of qualitative research interviews with people with moderate or severe TBI (n= 12) and their close relatives (n= 8), and were then analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic interpretation. This study shows that living with moderate or severe TBI means living with a perpetually altered body that changed the whole life and caused deep suffering, where feelings of shame and dignity competed with each other. People with TBI lost their way and struggled to achieve a new normalcy. Losing one's way included experiences of waking up to unknown, missing relationships and experiencing the body as an enemy. Struggles to attain a new normalcy included searching for an explanation, recovering the self, wishing to be met with respect, and finding {{a new way of}} living. Living with a person with moderate or severe TBI means that close relatives fight not to lose their foothold when it becomes essential for them to take increased responsibility. They struggled with their own suffering and compassion for the person with TBI. Close relatives' willingness to fight for the ill person derived from their feeling of natural love and the ethical demand to care and be responsible for the other. Natural love between the person with TBI, close relatives and other family members gave them the strength to fight. The comprehensive understanding revealed that people with moderate and severe TBI and their close relatives were forced to live a different everyday life where enduring uncertainty, <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> and loneliness, but also retaining hope were all present. They were rather alone in their suffering and their need for help, both as individuals and as a family, remained great even many years after the injury.

40|$|Nursing {{research}} has been performed during the last 20 - 30 years, about the next of kin’s vulnerability. Despite this, {{the health care system}} has had difficulties to integrate the next of kin in a way that gives support. The overall aim of the thesis was to describe and further explore the life situation of the next of kin to persons who are long-term ill, disabled, and/or older, and in need of care. Method: Multiple methods were used. Study I had a descriptive design, 44 next of kin of patients with multiple sclerosis were interviewed, latent content analysis was used for the analysis. Study II had a mixed method approach; the descriptive core study was analyzed with directed content analysis. The supplementary study with descriptive, correlative design was analyzed with descriptive and correlative statistics. Forty-four next of kin of patients with multiple sclerosis were interviewed; thereafter 37 of them answered a questionnaire about Quality of Life. Study III had a descriptive, explorative design. Twelve next of kin of older persons were interviewed with repeated informal conversational interviews, analyzed with latent content analysis. Study IV was cross-sectional with a descriptive, correlative design. Eighty-four next of kin of persons who were long-term ill, disabled, and/or older answered two questionnaires about Burden and Quality of Life that were analyzed with descriptive and correlative statistics. Results and Conclusions: Next of kin described a balance/imbalance in their relations to others and a high burden, but in general a good Quality of Life. Some next of kin also experienced <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow.</b> Significant correlations were found between interpersonal relations and Quality of Life as a whole. Love and obligations were two anchor points on a continuum, describing the next of kin’s relationship to the ill/disabled person. The relationship with the health care personnel was described through cooperation and obligations. Good communication was seen as the key to balance the relationship with others. One possibility to achieve symmetrical communications is to adapt the Partnership Model, as a tool for creating good relationships. Honest and specific communication between the health care personnel, the next of kin, and the care receiver are necessary...|$|E
40|$|Transition into {{adulthood}} is a developmental outcome of late adolescence. The transition to independent living, for all adolescents, represents a normalizing task towards adulthood. For some adolescents with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) this transition occurs against a back-drop of impaired social relatedness, lengthy out-of-home placements, limited family support, and limited financial resources. The {{purpose of this}} study was to ascertain the experience of adolescents with PDD who have transitioned into a supervised apartment setting associated with an adult mental health services provider. The research questions addressed in this study were: What is the experience of adolescents with PDD who have transitioned into a supervised apartment setting? How do adolescents with pervasive developmental disorder perceive their current functioning? ^ The concept of transition, proposed by Chick and Meleis (1986) as a central concept of nursing, was used to guide the study. Descriptive qualitative research methodology was used to analyze data. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants. Ten individuals volunteered to participate in a face-to-face interview that occurred in their apartments. A semi-structured interview was used to gather data around living environment, presentation of self, personal history, and relationships with others. The predominant request posed to participants was: “Tell me about something that has happened in the last few months that helped you understand that you were growing up and becoming more independent in your living. ” Thematic analysis occurred with all interview data. ^ This research resulted in a number of themes. Descriptions of the growing-up event were clustered around issues of increasing independence, clarification of relationship with mother, and accountability. Other identified themes included unrealistic goals for the future and poor physical health. The predominant and unexpected theme from all participant interviews involved <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow.</b> Participants were sad about their life situations, what they were missing, and what they lacked in social relationships. Nurses need to be aware of the quality of life issues around managing a severely impaired population attempting to live within a community. This study described the life situations of ten impaired participants involved in structured independent living within a community. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of families are being invariably forced {{to take on the}} role of a caregiver to their relative with severe and persistent mental illness following the development of community psychiatry and a movement to deinstitutionalize mental health care, both in the developed and developing countries. The lived experiences of these family caregivers have attracted the attentions of a remarkable number of researchers in nursing, and other health and social care disciplines. However, {{a review of the literature}} has uncovered that the findings of their research studies generally are far from conclusive due to a variety of serious epistemological and methodological flaws. Furthermore, a large number of these studies are situated in the quantitative paradigm, and therefore are heavily influenced by scientism, which strongly advocates quantification, and the use of mathematics for the exploration of the phenomenon under study. The quantitative paradigm is antithesis to the study of the lived experiences of the family caregivers. The contention is that human experiences cannot be studied holistically and meaningfully with the detached observer approach that could only yield answers that are expressed in numbers and percentages rather than capturing the thick and rich human experiences in a vivid and poignant manner. Lastly, a large majority of these research studies are conducted in the western cultures, and therefore may not be applicable to the family caregivers in oriental cultures. Therefore, this Heideggerian hermeneutic study is undertaken with the aim of describing and constructing a possible interpretation of the day-to-day lived experiences of the Chinese family caregivers of relatives with severe and persistent mental illness in Malaysia. The seminal work of Martin Heidegger (1889 - 1976), Being and Time, Division I, underpin the philosophical framework of this study. Shared conversations, which center on the day-to-day lived experiences of the 19 Chinese family caregivers of relatives with severe and persistent mental illness in Malaysia that meet the study criteria were conducted. Eight major themes that reflect the meaning of the day-to-day lived experiences of the Chinese family caregivers emerged from the collected study data, which were thematically analyzed. The major themes include: Being thrown into the trajectories of family caregiving; Answering to the call of conscience; Managing the day-to-day care; Enduring the caregiving process; Surviving the caregiving process; <b>Chronic</b> <b>sorrow</b> and grief; Constant worries and fears; and Making sense of the caregiving experiences. The emergent themes were individually described and discussed in great depth from the Heideggerian perspective. The study highlights a number of critical issues and the thesis discusses these in depth. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 DM) {{is among}} the most common chronic childhood illnesses. Broad knowledge on complex daily management regimens including insulin injections, blood glucose monitoring, regular carbohydrate containing meals and exercise are required, to achieve normal growth and development, to prevent complications, and to promote and sustain optimal functioning for the child. If untreated, severe fluid, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances lead to dehydration, coma and death within a week. Accordingly, patient education is essential and needs to be addressed if T 1 DM is to be tackled, especially in developing countries. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess children's and parents' perceptions of T 1 DM and their need for information and education in Tajikistan. Study design: Qualitative. Methods: In-depth interviews with-, and focused observation of 18 diabetic children/adolescents (¡Ü 18 yrs: n= 15; ¡Ý 18 yrs: n= 3; age variation: 3 - 23 yrs, duration of disease: 20 d- 14 yrs), their parents and endocrinologists (n= 4) provided qualitative data from three out of four regions in Tajikistan (Region of Republican Subordination, Khatlon Region, Sughd Region). Purposive- and snowball sampling were used. One focus group discussion with diabetic children and descriptive observation from three diabetes days were used to triangulate the data provided in the interviews. Data was analyzed according to Malterud¡¯s systematic text condensation. Findings: From discussions and observations three pertinent themes were identified: (1) Finding out the child has diabetes, (2) Life with T 1 DM (Responses related to (a) emotions, (b) biomedical knowledge and (c) the health system) and (3) I would like to know more about/ I would suggest. (1) Emotional stress and the "evil eye" were perceived to cause T 1 DM. Most families had no knowledge about T 1 DM prior to diagnosis and medical personnel lacked awareness that diabetes could occur in children. Almost all children were severely sick at diagnosis and 11 out of 18 children had been in a coma at least once from diagnosis and onwards. (2) (a) Responses related to emotions were characterized by an ambiguous relationship between living with a chronic illness in reality and the uncertainty whether there was a cure that was yet unknown to them. Families experienced <b>chronic</b> <b>sorrow,</b> where coping was felt as an ongoing and spiral process by parents, whereas diabetic children struggled emotionally and showed few adaptive coping strategies. Mocking and stigmatization, due to impaired growth and delayed pubertal development generated inordinate stress, where 8 of 16 school-aged children stopped attending school. (b) Responses related to biomedical knowledge included diet, where sweets, bread and "oily food" were perceived as the worst foods for diabetic children. Only a few used glucometers as they believed to sense their blood glucose level. Further they were not able to read the English instructions and could not afford the expenses. Insulin injections were frequently left out as mothers had compassion and did not want to hurt their child. All children had experiences with hyperglycemia, but few were aware of its causality and long-term complications. Symptoms of hypoglycemia were not easily recognized. (c) Responses related to the health system were that families experienced insulin procurement as a main challenge. In addition, unofficial private payments often hindered families to seek professional help. (3) Diabetic children, their parents and medical doctors desired more written information targeting children with T 1 DM in Tajikistan. Further the value of diabetes camps was emphasized. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study has shown that 90 years after insulin saved the life of the first diabetic child, where the uniformly fatal disorder became a chronic illness with potential long-term survival, not much has changed for children with T 1 DM in Tajikistan. In this study it was found that little was known about T 1 DM and its treatment and that the health system had limited capacity to meet the needs of diabetic children in Tajikistan. With a globally estimated rise in incidence of T 1 DM, advocacy and allocation of financial resources are essential to improve diabetes care in resource constrained countries, so that children with T 1 DM can be empowered, preserve life quality and emotional health, and have a prolonged life expectancy...|$|E
