25|$|Early {{forms of}} proto-capitalism and free markets {{were present in}} the Caliphate. An early market economy and early form of {{merchant}} capitalism developed between the 8th and 12th centuries. A vigorous monetary economy developed based on the wide circulation of a common currency (the dinar) and the integration of previously independent monetary areas. Business techniques and forms of business organization employed during this time included early contracts, bills of exchange, long-distance international trade, early forms of partnership (mufawada) such as limited partnerships (mudaraba), and early forms of credit, debt, profit, loss, capital (al-mal), capital accumulation (nama al-mal), <b>circulating</b> <b>capital,</b> capital expenditure, revenue, cheques, promissory notes, trusts (waqf), savings accounts, transactional accounts, pawning, loaning, exchange rates, bankers, money changers, ledgers, deposits, assignments, the double-entry bookkeeping system, and lawsuits. Organizational enterprises similar to corporations independent from the state also existed in the medieval Islamic world. Many of these concepts were adopted and further advanced in medieval Europe from the 13th century onwards.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, I do {{not believe}} that, as things are {{actually}} transacted, improvements in production are often, if ever, injurious, even temporarily, to the laboring-classes in the aggregate. They would be so if they took place suddenly to a great amount, {{because much of the}} capital sunk must necessarily in that case be provided from funds already employed as <b>circulating</b> <b>capital.</b> But improvements are always introduced very gradually, and are seldom or never made by withdrawing <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> from actual production, but are made by the employment of the annual increase. I doubt if there would be found a single example of a great increase of fixed capital, at a time and place where <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> was not rapidly increasing likewise.|$|E
60|$|It already appears, {{from these}} considerations, that the {{conversion}} of <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> into fixed, whether by railways, or manufactories, or ships, or machinery, or canals, or mines, or works of drainage and irrigation, is not likely, in any rich country, to diminish the gross produce or the amount of employment for labor. There is hardly any increase of fixed capital which does not enable the country to contain eventually a larger <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> than it otherwise could possess and employ within its own limits; for there is hardly any creation of fixed capital which, when it proves successful, does not cheapen the articles on which wages are habitually expended.|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} the {{theoretical}} distinction between fixed and <b>circulating</b> <b>capital.</b> Since all wealth which is destined to be employed for reproduction comes within the designation of capital, {{there are parts of}} capital which do not agree with the definition of either species of it; for instance, the stock of finished goods which a manufacturer or dealer at any time possesses unsold in his warehouses. But this, though capital as to its destination, is not yet capital in actual exercise; it is not engaged in production, but has first to be sold or exchanged, that is, converted into an equivalent value of some other commodities, and therefore is not yet either fixed or <b>circulating</b> <b>capital,</b> but will become either one or the other, or be eventually divided between them.|$|E

50|$|In Marxian economics, the {{official}} concept of CFC is also disputed, {{because it is}} argued that CFC really should refer to the value transferred by living labor from fixed assets to new output. Consequently, operating expenditures associated with fixed assets other than depreciation should be regarded as either as <b>circulating</b> constant <b>capital,</b> faux frais of production or surplus value, depending on the case. Furthermore, the measured difference between economic depreciation and actual depreciation charges will either add or lower the magnitude of total surplus value.|$|R
5000|$|In Marxian social accounting, one {{theoretical}} controversy {{concerns the}} treatment of the wages of so-called productive and unproductive labour. Unproductive labour by definition does not make net additions to the new value product, but only transfers value from other sectors on the basis that it reduces the costs of capitalist production. Depending on how the gross and net product are defined, the value of these wages could be accounted for either as a component of surplus value, or as a <b>circulating</b> constant <b>capital</b> outlay, or be excluded from the value product altogether.|$|R

60|$|There {{is a great}} {{difference}} between the effects of circulating and those of fixed capital, {{on the amount of}} the gross produce of the country. <b>Circulating</b> <b>capital</b> being destroyed as such, the result of a single use must be a reproduction equal to the whole amount of the <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> used, and a profit besides. This, however, is by no means necessary in the case of fixed capital. Since machinery, for example, is not wholly consumed by one use, it is not necessary that it should be wholly replaced from the product of that use. The machine answers the purpose of its owner if it brings in, during each interval of time, enough to cover the expense of repairs, and the deterioration in value which the machine has sustained during the same time, with a surplus sufficient to yield the ordinary profit on the entire value of the machine.|$|E

It also argues that this is an important primer to understanding the ‘credit crunch’ of 2007 and its repercussions. The article focuses particularly on how the current significance of securitization and RMBS {{can be traced back to}} the ‘Big Bang’ and the wider processes of the competitive re-regulation of the City of London and the British financial system more generally during the mid- 1980 s. It shows the differential evolution of securitization in the UK and US, and in so doing argues that such spatial variations have left different financial institutions in the two economies exposed to different forms of credit and market risk...|$|R

6000|$|To these {{considerations}} must be added, that, even if improvements {{did for a}} time decrease the aggregate produce and the <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> of the community, they would not the less tend {{in the long run}} to augment both. This tendency of improvements in production to cause increased accumulation, and thereby ultimately to increase the gross produce, even if temporarily diminishing it, will assume a still more decided character if it should appear that there are assignable limits both to the accumulation of capital and to the increase of production from the land, which limits once attained, all further increase of produce must stop; but that improvements in production, whatever may be their other effects, tend to throw one or both of these limits farther off. Now, these are truths which will appear in the clearest light in a subsequent stage of our investigation. It will be seen that the quantity of capital which will, or even which can, be accumulated in any country, and the amount of gross produce which will, or even which can, be raised, bear a proportion to the state of the arts of production there existing; and that every improvement, even if for the time it diminish the <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> and the gross produce, ultimately makes room for a larger amount of both than could possibly have existed otherwise. It is this which is the conclusive answer to the objections against machinery; and the proof thence arising of the ultimate benefit to laborers of mechanical inventions, even in the existing state of society, will hereafter be seen to be conclusive.(113) ...|$|E
60|$|The same {{considerations}} {{enable us}} to throw aside as unworthy of regard {{one of the common}} arguments against emigration as a means of relief for the laboring-class. Emigration, it is said, can do no good to the laborers, if, in order to defray the cost, as much must be taken away from the capital of the country as from its population. If one tenth of the laboring people of England were transferred to the colonies, and along with them one tenth of the <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> of the country, either wages, or profits, or both, would be greatly benefited, by the diminished pressure of capital and population upon the fertility of the land. The landlords alone would sustain some loss of income; and even they, only if colonization went to the length of actually diminishing capital and population, but not if it merely carried off the annual increase.|$|E
60|$|Wages, then, depend mainly {{upon the}} demand and supply of labor; or, {{as it is}} often expressed, on the {{proportion}} between population and capital. By population is here meant the number only of the laboring-class, or rather of those who work for hire; and by capital, only <b>circulating</b> <b>capital,</b> and not even the whole of that, but the part which is expended in the direct purchase of labor. To this, however, must be added all funds which, without forming a part of capital, are paid in exchange for labor, such as the wages of soldiers, domestic servants, and all other unproductive laborers. There is unfortunately no mode of expressing, by one familiar term, the aggregate {{of what may be}} called the wages-fund of a country: and, as the wages of productive labor form nearly the whole of that fund, it is usual to overlook the smaller and less important part, and to say that wages depend on population and capital. It will be convenient to employ this expression, remembering, however, to consider it as elliptical, and not as a literal statement of the entire truth.|$|E

Attention was paid to the fact that two most burning issues require immediate solution in the social sphere: poverty and unemployment. It was substantiated that the orientation for the crisis' escape must rely heavily on financing the labour's renumeration through its direct increase and to avoid the increase of unemployment's rate. There have been investigated the approaches that will allow to overcome the limitations of individual capital because credit is an important tool for escaping the crisis, as it provides the maintenance of goods and services' process of realization which is an important source in the conditions of <b>circulating</b> <b>capital's</b> limitation.

6000|$|The {{argument}} {{relied on}} {{by most of}} those who contend that machinery can never be injurious to the laboring-class is, that by cheapening production it creates such an increased demand for the commodity as enables, ere long, a greater number of persons than ever to find employment in producing it. The argument does not seem to me to have the weight commonly ascribed to it. The fact, though too broadly stated, is, no doubt, often true. The copyists who were thrown out of employment by the invention of printing were doubtless soon outnumbered by the compositors and pressmen who took their place; and the number of laboring persons now employed in the cotton manufacture is many times greater than were so occupied previously to the inventions of Hargreaves and Arkwright, which shows that, besides the enormous fixed capital now embarked in the manufacture, it also employs a far larger <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> than at any former time. But if this capital was drawn from other employments, if the funds which took the place of the capital sunk in costly machinery were supplied not by any additional saving consequent on the improvements, but by drafts on the general capital of the community, what better are the laboring-classes for the mere transfer? ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{the capital}} {{engaged in the}} {{production}} of any commodity, there is a part which, after being once used, exists no longer as capital; is no longer capable of rendering service to production, or at least not the same service, nor to the same sort of production. Such, for example, is the portion of capital which consists of materials. The tallow and alkali of which soap is made, once used in the manufacture, are destroyed as alkali and tallow. In the same division must be placed the portion of capital which is paid as the wages, or consumed as the subsistence, of laborers. That part of the capital of a cotton-spinner which he pays away to his work-people, once so paid, exists no longer as his capital, or as a cotton-spinner’s capital. Capital which in this manner fulfills the whole of its office in the production in which it is engaged, by a single use, is called <b>Circulating</b> <b>Capital.</b> The term, which is not very appropriate, is derived from the circumstance that this portion of capital requires to be constantly renewed by the sale of the finished product, and when renewed is perpetually parted with in buying materials and paying wages; so that it does its work, not by being kept, but by changing hands.|$|E
60|$|A {{connected}} and comprehensive grasp of principles {{was the great}} achievement of Adam Smith;(28) for, although the “Wealth of Nations” was naturally not without faults, {{it has been the}} basis of all subsequent discussion and advance in political economy. In Books I and II his own system is elucidated, while Book IV contains his discussion of the Agricultural School and the attacks on the mercantile system. Seeing distinctly that labor was the basis of all production (not merely in agriculture), he shows (Books I and II) that the wealth of a country depends on the skill with which its labor is applied, and upon the proportion of productive to unproductive laborers. The gains from division of labor are explained, and money appears as a necessary instrument after society has reached such a division. He is then led to discuss prices (market price) and value; and, since from the price a distribution takes place among the factors of production, he is brought to wages, profit, and rent. The functions of capital are explained in general; the separation of fixed from <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> is made; and he discusses the influence of capital on the distribution of productive and unproductive labor; the accumulation of capital, money, paper money, and interest. He, therefore, gets a connected set of ideas on production, distribution, and exchange. On questions of production not much advance has been made since his day; and his rules of taxation are now classic. He attacked vigorously the balance-of-trade theory, and the unnatural diversion of industry in England by prohibitions, bounties, and the arbitrary colonial system. In brief, he held that a plan for the regulation of industry by the Government was indefensible, and that to direct private persons how to employ their capital was either hurtful or useless. He taught that a country will be more prosperous if its neighbors are prosperous, and that nations have no interest in injuring each other. It was, however, but human that his work should have been somewhat defective.(29) A new period in the history of political economy, however, begins with Adam Smith. As Roscher says, he stands in the center of economic history.|$|E

In that case, the reported consumption of fixed capital could contain an element of undistributed profit.

60|$|From {{the same}} {{principles}} we {{are now able to}} arrive at a final conclusion respecting the effects which machinery, and generally the sinking of capital for a productive purpose, produce upon the immediate and ultimate interests of the laboring-class. The characteristic property of this class of industrial improvements is the conversion of <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> into fixed: and it was shown in the first book(303) that, in a country where capital accumulates slowly, the introduction of machinery, permanent improvements of land, and the like, might be, for the time, extremely injurious; since the capital so employed might be directly taken from the wages fund, the subsistence of the people and the employment for labor curtailed, and the gross annual produce of the country actually diminished. But in a country of great annual savings and low profits no such effects need be apprehended. It merely draws off at one orifice what was already flowing out at another; or, if not, the greater vacant space left in the reservoir does but cause a greater quantity to flow in. Accordingly, in spite of the mischievous derangements of the money market which have been occasioned by the great sums in process of being sunk in railways, I can not agree with those who apprehend any mischief, from this source, to the productive resources of the country. Not on the absurd ground (which to any one acquainted with the elements of the subject needs no confutation) that railway expenditure is a mere transfer of capital from hand to hand, by which nothing is lost or destroyed. This is true of what is spent in the purchase of the land; a portion too of what is paid to agents, counsels, engineers, and surveyors, is saved by those who receive it, and becomes capital again: but what is laid out in the bona fide construction of the railway itself is lost and gone; when once expended, it is incapable of ever being paid in wages or applied to the maintenance of laborers again; as a matter of account, the result is, that so much food and clothing and tools have been consumed, and the country has got a railway instead.|$|E

50|$|Building on {{the work}} of Quesnay and Turgot, Adam Smith (1776) made the first {{explicit}} distinction between fixed and <b>circulating</b> <b>capital.</b> In his usage, <b>circulating</b> <b>capital</b> includes wages and labour maintenance, money, and inputs from land, mines, and fisheries associated with production.|$|E

The Gustavian Count Axel von Fersen the Younger was lynched, suspected {{to be involved in}} the alleged murder. The mob then sought Fersen's sister, Countess Sophie Piper, who was the intimate friend of the Queen and was said to influence her. The mob was told that Piper was with the Queen at Haga Palace.|$|R

In the case of a unilateral measure, in a world where <b>capital</b> <b>circulates</b> freely, the scale of the reduction in their profits may threaten their immediate survival, or at least their modernization, including their ability to reinvest in low carbon technologies. Rather than exempting them from the tax, the solution is to grant them an allowance based on their carbon use and their capital intensity ([6] p. 4).|$|R
