2500|$|Acupuncture {{began to}} spread to Europe {{in the second half}} of the 17th century. Around this time the surgeon-general of the Dutch East India Company met Japanese and <b>Chinese</b> <b>acupuncture</b> {{practitioners}} and later encouraged Europeans to further investigate it. He published the first in-depth description of acupuncture for the European audience and created the term [...] "acupuncture" [...] in his 1683 work De Acupunctura. France was an early adopter among the West due to the influence of Jesuit missionaries, who brought the practice to French clinics in the 16th century.

These therapeutic points and energy pathways, known as sen, are engraved on the human figures, with explanations given on the walls next to the plaques.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{observe the}} {{curative}} effect of combined <b>Chinese</b> medicine, <b>acupuncture</b> and rehabilitation therapy on vascular dementia (VD), and {{to compare the}} Western medicine piracetam. MethodsTotal 134 VD patients screened {{in reference to the}} standard for VD diagnosis in DSM-IV were randomly divided into a Chinese medicine plus rehabilitation group (32 cases), a <b>Chinese</b> medicine plus <b>acupuncture</b> group (33 cases), a <b>Chinese</b> medicine and <b>acupuncture</b> plus rehabilitation group (37 cases) and a Western medicine piracetam group (32 cases). Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Bless Behavior Scale (BBS) were used to assess changes in intelligence disorder before treatment and after 12 -week treatment. ResultsBBS score, living ability and daily habit were enhanced after treatment in all groups. Cognitive function and behavioral ability were improved with similar total curative effects in all the 4 groups. Directional ability and short-term memory ability were significantly enhanced after treatment (P < 0. 05) in both the Chinese medicine plus rehabilitation group and the <b>Chinese</b> medicine plus <b>acupuncture</b> group groups. Living ability was significantly improved after treatment in the <b>Chinese</b> medicine and <b>acupuncture</b> plus rehabilitation group (P < 0. 01). However, no obvious difference was shown before and after treatment in the piracetam group. ConclusionThe improvement of living ability in the comprehensive treatment group is better than that in the other groups. <b>Chinese</b> medicine and <b>acupuncture</b> plus rehabilitation treatment can improve intelligence and living ability of senile VD patients...|$|R

5000|$|Urban {{acupuncture}} is a socio-environmental {{theory that}} combines contemporary urban design with traditional <b>Chinese</b> <b>acupuncture,</b> using small-scale interventions {{to transform the}} larger urban context.
