5|$|The {{passing of}} the Antarctic Conservation Act (1978) in the U.S. brought several {{restrictions}} to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of alien plants or animals can bring a <b>criminal</b> <b>penalty,</b> as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The overfishing of krill, which plays {{a large role in}} the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000tonnes (35,300short tons) in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Today, alcohol {{laws are}} {{controlled}} by the state government, and local jurisdictions are prohibited from going beyond those state laws. Missouri has no statewide open container law or prohibition on drinking in public, no alcohol-related blue laws, no local option, no precise locations for selling liquor by the package (allowing even drug stores and gas stations to sell any kind of liquor), and no differentiation of laws based on alcohol percentage. State law protects persons from arrest or <b>criminal</b> <b>penalty</b> for public intoxication.|$|E

25|$|After {{the breakup}} of the USSR, the problem of {{homelessness}} sharpened dramatically, partially because of the legal vacuum of the early 1990s with some laws contradicting each other and partially because of a high rate of frauds in the realty market. In 1991 articles 198 and 209 of Russian criminal code which instituted a <b>criminal</b> <b>penalty</b> for not having permanent residence were abolished. In Moscow, the first overnight shelter for homeless was opened in 1992. In the late 1990s, certain amendments in law were implemented to reduce the rise in homelessness, such as the prohibition of selling last flat with registered children.|$|E
500|$|In general, Czech penal theory recognizes certain {{classes of}} {{circumstances}} where criminal & civil liability will be excluded {{in respect of}} actions which would normally attract a <b>criminal</b> <b>penalty.</b> These include [...] "utmost necessity", [...] "necessary self defense" [...] and other cases involving [...] "eligible use of a gun".|$|E

2500|$|Minister Donnedieu de Vabres {{was criticized}} by parliamentarians {{for lack of}} preparation. For instance, François Bayrou, head of the center-right UDF party, criticised how the {{minister}} submitted a last minute pair of amendments of seven pages completely changing the <b>criminal</b> <b>penalty</b> system applicable to illegal copies of copyrighted material, and for creating a de facto [...] "police of the Internet". He pointed out that modifications of such an importance should be examined in commission.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first signs}} of the modern {{distinction}} between crimes and civil matters emerged during the Norman Invasion of England. [...] The special notion of <b>criminal</b> <b>penalty,</b> at least concerning Europe, arose in Spanish Late Scolasticism (see Alfonso de Castro), when the theological notion of God's penalty (poena aeterna) that was inflicted solely for a guilty mind, became transfused into canon law first and, finally, to secular criminal law. [...] The development of the state dispensing justice in a court clearly emerged {{in the eighteenth century}} when European countries began maintaining police services. From this point, criminal law had formalized the mechanisms for enforcement, which allowed for its development as a discernible entity.|$|E

2500|$|First {{convening}} in 1954, {{the legal}} {{experts in the}} criminal code commission (Strafrechtskommission) continued to debate the future of Paragraph 175; while the constitutional court ruled it was not unconstitutional, this did not mean it should forever remain in force. It was therefore the commission's job to advise the Ministry of Justice and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer about the new form this law should take. While they all agreed homosexual activity was immoral, they were divided {{when it came to}} whether or not it should be allowed to be practiced between consenting adults in private. Due to their belief that homosexuals were not born that way, but rather, they fell victim to seduction, the Justice Ministry officials remained concerned that if freed from <b>criminal</b> <b>penalty,</b> adult homosexuals would intensify their [...] "propaganda and activity in public" [...] and put male youth at risk.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{corruption}} scandals {{broke out}} under Olusegun Obasanjo's presidency, {{including one of}} international dimensions when his vice president was caught in cahoots with a US Congressman stashing cold hard cash (literally) in freezers. In addition to this, the KBR and Siemens bribery scandals broke out under his administration, which was serially investigated by the FBI and led to international indictments indicating high-level corruption in his administration. According to reports, [...] "while Nigeria dithered, the United States Department of Justice on January 18, 2012 announced that a Japanese construction firm, Marubeni Corporation, agreed to pay a $54.6 million <b>criminal</b> <b>penalty</b> for allegedly bribing officials of the Nigerian government to facilitate the award of the $6 billion liquefied natural gas contract in Bonny, Nigeria to a multinational consortium, TSKJ". [...] They paid bribes to Nigerian government officials between 1995 and 2004, {{in violation of the}} United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.|$|E
2500|$|The US Justice Department and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed {{charges against}} BP Products North America Inc. (subsidiary of BP plc) and several BP traders, alleging they conspired {{to raise the}} price of propane by seeking to corner the propane market in 2004. In 2006, one former trader pleaded guilty. In 2007, BP paid $303 million in {{restitution}} and fines {{as part of an}} agreement to defer prosecution. BP was charged with cornering and manipulating the price of TET propane in 2003 and 2004. BP paid a $125 million civil monetary penalty to the CFTC, established a compliance and ethics program, and installed a monitor to oversee BP’s trading activities in the commodities markets. BP also paid $53 million into a restitution fund for victims, a $100 million <b>criminal</b> <b>penalty,</b> plus $25 million into a consumer fraud fund, as well as other payments. [...] Also in 2007, four other former traders were charged. These charges were dismissed by a US District Court in 2009 {{on the grounds that the}} transactions were exempt under the Commodities Exchange Act because they didn't occur in a marketplace but were negotiated contracts among sophisticated companies.

2500|$|The {{first case}} was a major test of the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) {{enforcement}} of the Taft-Hartley Act. In 1951, Lannom Manufacturing Co. refused to honor its contract with the International Fur and Leather Workers Union {{on the grounds that}} the union's officers had lied when making their Taft-Hartley anti-communist oaths. The union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the employer with the NLRB. The Board found against the employer, but after Gold's conviction in April 1954 it reversed itself. The union, already embroiled in a similar case, asked the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals for a stay; the court declined. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, granted certiorari. [...] In Meat Cutters v. NLRB, 352 U.S. 153 (1956), the Supreme Court (relying on a decision released earlier that day, Leedom v. Mine Workers, 352 U.S. 145) held that the National Labor Relations Board had no authority to refuse to provide the protections of the NLRA to unions not in compliance with the Taft-Hartley Act. [...] " [...] conclude that the sole sanction for the filing of a false affidavit under 9 (h) is the <b>criminal</b> <b>penalty</b> imposed on the officer who files a false affidavit, not decompliance of the union nor the withholding of the benefits of the Act," [...] the court ruled.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{subtitle}} {{deals with}} currency crimes. Largely {{because of the}} effectiveness of the BSA, money launders had been avoiding traditional financial institutions to launder money and were using cash-based businesses to avoid them. A new effort was made to stop the laundering of money through bulk currency movements, mainly focusing on the confiscation of criminal proceeds and the increase in penalties for money laundering. Congress found that a criminal offense of merely evading the reporting of money transfers was insufficient and decided {{that it would be better}} if the smuggling of the bulk currency itself was the offense. Therefore, the BSA was amended to make it a criminal offense to evade currency reporting by concealing more than US$10,000 on any person or through any luggage, merchandise or other container that moves into or out of the U.S. The penalty for such an offense is up to 5 years imprisonment and the forfeiture of any property up to the amount that was being smuggled. It also made the civil and <b>criminal</b> <b>penalty</b> violations of currency reporting cases be the forfeiture of all a defendant's property that was involved in the offense, and any property traceable to the defendant. The Act prohibits and penalizes those who run unlicensed money transmitting businesses. In 2005, this provision of the USA PATRIOT Act was used to prosecute Yehuda Abraham for helping to arrange money transfers for British arms dealer Hermant Lakhani, who was arrested in August 2003 after being caught in a government sting. Lakhani had tried to sell a missile to an FBI agent posing as a Somali militant. The definition of counterfeiting was expanded to encompass analog, digital or electronic image reproductions, and it was made an offense to own such a reproduction device. Penalties were increased to 20 years imprisonment. Money laundering [...] "unlawful activities" [...] was expanded to include the provision of material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist organizations. The Act specifies that anyone who commits or conspires to undertake a fraudulent activity outside the jurisdiction of the United States, and which would be an offense in the U.S., will be prosecuted under , which deals with fraud and related activity in connection with access devices.|$|E
