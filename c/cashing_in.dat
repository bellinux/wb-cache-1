5|$|On the April 30, 2007, {{episode of}} Raw, Edge and Orton {{met in a}} {{one-on-one}} match. Edge won the match by pinning Orton following a spear. Edge then moved to the SmackDown brand on the May 11 episode after <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> the Money in the Bank briefcase (which he had won from Mr. Kennedy on the same episode of Raw) to win the World Heavyweight Championship from then-champion The Undertaker. With this move, Rated-RKO was officially disbanded.|$|E
5|$|On the May 15 {{episode of}} Raw, Rob Van Dam lost the WWE Intercontinental Championship to Shelton Benjamin in a rematch. The {{following}} week, after John Cena defeated Chris Masters in a singles match, Rob Van Dam {{came out and}} informed Cena {{that he would be}} <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> his Money in the Bank contract, that he won at WrestleMania at ECW One Night Stand. On the May 29 episode of Raw, Van Dam was selected by ECW Representative Paul Heyman to be drafted from Raw to WWE's new ECW brand. At One Night Stand, Cena lost the WWE Championship to Van Dam in an Extreme Rules match.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} feud on the SmackDown! brand {{was between}} Edge and Batista, {{with the two}} feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. The feud started on the May 11 episode of SmackDown! when Batista challenged The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship in a steel cage match. Both men escaped the steel cage at the same time, thus ending in a draw. After the match, Mark Henry made his return and attacked The Undertaker. Edge then defeated The Undertaker for the World Heavyweight Championship after <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> his Money in the Bank contract, {{which is used to}} receive a title match of the owner's time and place of choosing. On the May 18 episode of SmackDown!, Batista confronted Edge and challenged him to a match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Judgment Day.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{earned a}} spot in the 2007 Money in the Bank ladder match by {{defeating}} Sabu in an Extreme Rules match in a February episode of ECW on Sci Fi. At WrestleMania 23, Kennedy won the Money in the Bank ladder match, giving him the right to challenge any World Champion in WWE at any date up until WrestleMania XXIV. Kennedy announced on the April 30 episode of Raw that he would be <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> his Money in the Bank championship opportunity at WrestleMania 24. On the May 7 episode of Raw, Kennedy, however, lost his Money in the Bank opportunity to Edge, losing mere moments after being struck with a monitor before the match began. Because of the injury Kennedy sustained during his match with Edge, it was revealed that his right triceps muscle tore off the bone and he would be out for a minimum of five to seven months. The injury, however, was not as serious, as the triceps tendon did not tear off the bone but was, in fact, a massive hematoma.|$|E
5|$|On the July 25 {{episode of}} Raw, Mysterio won the tournament {{to become the}} new WWE Champion, and {{immediately}} had to fend off Alberto Del Rio {{to prevent him from}} <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> his Money in the Bank. TripleH, now Chief Operating Officer, decreed that Mysterio was to face ex-champion Cena later that night for the title; Cena won and again became WWE Champion. After the match, Punk made an unannounced return to WWE with the old WWE Championship belt to confront Cena. Cena and Punk later fought in a match at SummerSlam on August 14 to crown the undisputed WWE Champion, which Punk won controversially as Triple H didn't see Cena's leg was on the rope and it was actually a rope break. As Punk celebrated, Kevin Nash made his WWE return and assaulted him. Del Rio then cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and pinned Punk to become the new champion after kicking Punk in the head. Punk regained the WWE Championship from Del Rio at Survivor Series in November 2011; starting a 434-day reign until The Rock beat him at the 2013 Royal Rumble event.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2008, Edge faced Batista in a {{match for}} his title at Night of Champions. Due to {{interference}} from La Familia and a belt shot from Edge, {{he was able to}} defeat Batista. The next night on Raw, which happened a week after that year's draft lottery, Edge came out to gloat about his victory as well as the fact that, thanks to the draft, both the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship were both SmackDown property (Triple H, who was the reigning WWE Champion at the time, was drafted to SmackDown and had retained his title at Night of Champions as well). As Edge was leaving the ring, an angry Batista (who had been drafted back to Raw after three years as a SmackDown wrestler) came out and chased Edge back to the ring. He proceeded to assault Edge, finishing with a Batista Bomb in the ring. Just as Batista was leaving, CM Punk ran to the ring carrying the Money in the Bank briefcase he had won at WrestleMania XXIV, with referee Mike Chioda tagging along with him. Since Edge was still out of it from the attack, he did not see Punk come into the ring and therefore was unaware that Punk was <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> his contract. Once the bell rang, Punk simply hit Edge with a Go To Sleep and pinned him to win the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
50|$|Board {{members had}} {{discovered}} discrepancies involving <b>cash</b> payments <b>in</b> lieu of leave days to non-teaching staff despite the board having given standing {{instructions to the}} suspects {{in the previous year}} {{that there should be no}} encashment of leave days. A forensic audit ordered by the school board established that Botha was allegedly paying herself unauthorised <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> lieu of leave with authorisation from Tirivavi without the school board's knowledge. Botha had received US$518,007 from the school as payment of <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> lieu of leave and overstated bonuses. Tirivavi received US$148,743 inclusive of <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> lieu of leave and term allowance. Shokobishi received US$19,903 as <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> lieu of leave.|$|R

5|$|In later Money in the Bank events, John Cena, Randy Orton and Sheamus won Money in the Bank ladder {{matches in}} 2012, 2013 and 2015 respectively. Cena <b>cashed</b> <b>in</b> on CM Punk and won via disqualification; thus Punk {{retained}} the WWE Championship. Orton <b>cashed</b> <b>in</b> on Daniel Bryan and captured the WWE Championship. Sheamus <b>cashed</b> <b>in</b> on Roman Reigns and captured the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.|$|R
5|$|On the July 3 SmackDown, Ziggler {{defeated}} Alex Riley {{to qualify}} for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match. On July 13, Ziggler, Zack Ryder and Justin Roberts were involved in a car accident in San Diego while driving from Comic-Con; none of them suffered severe injuries. Two days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match to guarantee him the opportunity to challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from <b>cashing</b> <b>in.</b> On the following episode of SmackDown, Ziggler again attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus following a tag team match with Alberto Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost his touch, which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on SmackDown four days later, after Orton hit him with an RKO when Ziggler tried to cash his Money in the Bank contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him in a rematch on Raw by pinning him while holding his tights. Ziggler faced Orton again at Night of Champions where he lost again, ending the feud. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Ziggler captained the traditional 5-on-5 elimination tag team match opposite Mick Foley and won the match by last pinning Orton, making him the sole survivor of the match.|$|E
5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} One Night Stand was between John Cena and Rob Van Dam over the WWE Championship. At WrestleMania, Van Dam competed in a six-man Money in the Bank ladder match, in which Van Dam won and {{earned the right}} to face the {{champion}} of his choice anytime he wanted to in 12 months. On the May 22 episode of Raw, Cena defeated Chris Masters. After the match, Van Dam came out to the ring and announced that he was <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> his opportunity for the WWE Championship at One Night Stand. The two exchanged lefts and rights, with Masters getting involved. The distraction allowed Van Dam to toss his briefcase into Cena's face and then hit him with the Van Daminator. The two had a contract signing for their match on the June 5, 2006 episode of Raw. Before signing the contract, Van Dam told Cena that he would win the WWE Championship at One Night Stand and rename it the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. ECW representative Paul Heyman told Cena that the ECW fans can’t wait to boo him out of the Hammerstein Ballroom. Cena signed the contract and wished Van Dam luck. Heyman, however, told Cena that he had brought some people from ECW and at that point, Balls Mahoney, Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer and the Sandman came to the ring. Cena attempted to fight them off, but Sandman hit Cena with his Singapore cane. ECW's Sabu then came out and sent Cena through the table with his Atomic Arabian Facebuster move. Several Raw superstars ran out to attempt to fight off the ECW Originals. Because of this, a match was booked for the WWE vs. ECW Head to Head special that aired on the USA Network on June 7, 2006 between Cena and Sabu. The match ended in a no contest after ECW's newest wrestler, The Big Show attacked Cena, sparking a brawl between WWE and ECW superstars.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterward, the Parker/Gillespie band {{traveled}} to an unsuccessful engagement at Billy Berg's club in Los Angeles. Most {{of the group}} returned to New York, but Parker remained in California, <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> his return ticket to buy heroin. He experienced great hardship in California, eventually being committed to Camarillo State Mental Hospital for a six-month period.|$|E

Vilandos had his first <b>cash</b> <b>in</b> the WSOP in 1993, and won his first WSOP {{bracelet}} in 1995 in the $1,500 Pot Limit Holdem event. He had his highest WSOP Main Event finish the following year, busting out in 21st place, for a prize of $19,500.|$|R

25|$|Bermuda batted {{first and}} fell to 41/3, but {{thereafter}} recovered somewhat {{to put up a}} reasonable total of 201/7 from their 60 overs. Gibbons held the innings together with 58, while number seven OW Jones added a useful unbeaten 35; Rawson (3-28) had the best bowling figures. In reply, however, Zimbabwe sailed to an ominously impressive ten-wicket triumph inside 39 overs, with Paterson <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> for 123 not out while his batting partner Robin Brown reached 61 not out.|$|E
25|$|In early 2010, Poundland's then-owners Advent International were {{planning}} on <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> on the resurgence in discount retailers by preparing {{to put the}} chain up for sale. The report came as figures showed that value retailers were seeing a business boom in the current economic climate, with Barclays Private Equity expressing an interest in a potential take-over of Poundland for about £200 million. On Tuesday 4 May 2010, {{it was announced that}} Poundland had been sold to US private equity firm Warburg Pincus for £200 million and was the subject of an Initial Public Offering in March 2014.|$|E
25|$|Bill Lair {{retired from}} the CIA as a GS-16, the civil service {{equivalent}} of a brigadier general. He was 53 years old, with two grown children in college. He had a ranch to retire to, near Waco, but no means of <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> on his life experience except a return to Thailand. Refusing to trade on his old friendships overseas, he instead became a long haul trucker. His past Asian expertise would be called upon only once more, in 1992, when he was again asked about the chances of setting up a paramilitary network in Cambodia. He again deemed it impossible.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1990, Enigma Records, {{already having}} sold its {{interest}} in the band to the Geffen label, illegally released and distributed Fall from Grace, an unauthorized bootleg live album featuring songs from their first two releases and recorded at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The album was released without any input from the band members with regard to its songs, contents, credits, concepts, or artwork. The band learned of its existence when they stumbled upon it in a record store in Tucson, Arizona, on the night prior to suffering a near-fatal auto accident. Enigma Records folded after the release, <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> on the sales. The album was picked up, manufactured and distributed by Capitol Records, also possibly illegally.|$|E
500|$|Hastert {{has been}} married to Jean Hastert (née Kahl) since 1973. They have two children, Ethan and Joshua. Hastert's older son, Joshua, was a {{lobbyist}} for the firm PodestaMattoon, representing clients ranging from Amgen, a biotech company, to Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor. This provoked criticism from Congress Watch: [...] "There definitely should be restrictions ... This is family members <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> on connections ... is an ideal opportunity for special interest groups to exploit family relationships for personal gain." [...] Joshua rejoined {{that he does not}} lobby House Republican leaders.|$|E
500|$|After {{watching}} {{the first three}} episodes, Aaron Riccio of Slant Magazine also praised the new season, writing [...] "The plots have generally been the [...] "fringe" [...] of Fringe; the meat {{has been in the}} characters' developing feelings for one another. Now the two are not only on equal footing, but they're both firing on full cylinders... Afraid, perhaps, to toy with viewers the way that Lost did, Fringe keeps the action moving, rapidly unspooling its mysteries, and that decision proves to be a wise one. Rather than waiting for a future payoff, Fringe is <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> with every episode, showing us the escalating war between worlds—and with likeable characters and compelling cases to boot. Ironically, it's by branching out in two different directions that the show has become, more than ever, the centerpiece of a hypercompetitive Thursday night lineup." ...|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the release of}} Californication, the band embarked on a world tour to support the record, beginning in the United States. To culminate the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to close Woodstock '99, which became infamous for the resulting violence. The band was informed minutes before arriving that the crowds and bonfires in the fields {{had gone out of}} control. When the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix's song [...] "Fire" [...] to finish their set as a favor to Hendrix's sister, the disruption escalated into violence when several women, who had been crowd surfing and moshing, were raped and nearby property was looted and destroyed. Kiedis felt that [...] "It was clear that this situation {{had nothing to do with}} Woodstock any more. It wasn't symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and <b>cashing</b> <b>in...</b> We woke up to papers and radio stations vilifying us for playing 'Fire'." ...|$|E
500|$|As the {{controversy}} unfolded, the Wikipedia community began {{a review of}} Essjay's previous edits and some felt he had relied upon his fictional professorship to influence editorial consideration of edits he made. [...] "People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments", said Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator {{and founder of the}} Wikipedia community newspaper, the Signpost. [...] "Those will get looked at again." [...] For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as Catholicism for Dummies, a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church. Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: [...] "This is a text I often require for my students, and I would hang my own Ph.D. on it's [...] credibility." [...] In another case (a discussion of the liturgical use of the psalms), he cited personal experience from [...] "the Abbey of Gethsemani, where I was a monk." ...|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer's early acting {{appearances}} included television roles on Fantasy Island, Delta House and BAD Cats among others. She {{was one of}} {{the several}} candidates to audition as a replacement for Kate Jackson on the television series Charlie's Angels in 1979, although the part went to Shelley Hack. She had small roles in a few theatrical films, including Falling in Love Again (1980) with Susannah York, The Hollywood Knights (1980) opposite Tony Danza, and Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen (1981), none of which met with much critical or box office success. Pfeiffer later said of her early screen work: [...] "I needed to learn how to act... in the meantime, I was playing bimbos and <b>cashing</b> <b>in</b> on my looks." [...] She appeared in a television commercial for Lux soap, and took acting lessons at the Beverly Hills Playhouse, before appearing in three further television movies – Callie and Son (1981) with Lindsay Wagner, The Children Nobody Wanted (1981), and a 1981 TV movie remake of Splendor in the Grass.|$|E
