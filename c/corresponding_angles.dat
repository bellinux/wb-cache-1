25|$|One {{reason for}} {{the large number of}} options is that, as noted previously, {{rotations}} in three dimensions (and higher) do not commute. If we reverse a given sequence of rotations, we get a different outcome. This also implies that we cannot compose two rotations by adding their <b>corresponding</b> <b>angles.</b> Thus Euler angles are not vectors, despite a similarity in appearance as a triplet of numbers.|$|E

2500|$|Euclid {{refers to}} a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as [...] "equal" [...] (ἴσος) if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal, and {{similarly}} for angles. The stronger term [...] "congruent" [...] refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved {{on top of the other}} so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as similar. [...] <b>Corresponding</b> <b>angles</b> in a pair of similar shapes are congruent and corresponding sides are in proportion to each other.|$|E
60|$|The {{difficulty}} here encountered is chiefly that {{of figuring}} to ourselves the two angles {{at the base}} of the triangle ABC as remainders made by cutting one pair of angles out of another, while each pair shall be <b>corresponding</b> <b>angles</b> of triangles which have two sides and the intervening angle equal. It is by this happy contrivance that so many different inductions are brought to bear upon the same particular case. And this not being at all an obvious thought, it may be seen from an example so near the threshold of mathematics, how much scope there may well be for scientific dexterity in the higher branches of that and other sciences, in order so to combine a few simple inductions, as to bring within each of them innumerable cases which are not obviously included in it; and how long, and numerous, and complicated may be the processes necessary for bringing the inductions together, even when each induction may itself be very easy and simple. All the inductions involved in all geometry are comprised in those simple ones, the formulæ of which are the Axioms, and a few of the so-called Definitions. The remainder of the science is made up of the processes employed for bringing unforeseen cases within these inductions; or (in syllogistic language) for proving the minors necessary to complete the syllogisms; the majors being the definitions and axioms. In those definitions and axioms are laid down the whole of the marks, by an artful combination of which it has been found possible to discover and prove all that is proved in geometry. The marks being so few, and the inductions which furnish them being so obvious and familiar; the connecting of several of them together, which constitutes Deductions, or Trains of Reasoning, forms the whole difficulty of the science, and, with a trifling exception, its whole bulk; and hence Geometry is a Deductive Science.|$|E

50|$|The {{polarization}} angles show {{a regular}} shift in polarization angle with azimuth. For example, {{when the sun}} is setting in the West the polarization angles proceed around the horizon. At this time the degree of polarization is constant in circular bands centered around the sun. Thus the degree of polarization as well as its <b>corresponding</b> <b>angle</b> clearly shifts around the horizon. When the sun is located at the zenith the horizon represents a constant degree of polarization. The <b>corresponding</b> polarization <b>angle</b> still shifts with different directions toward the zenith from different points.|$|R

50|$|In geometry, a {{transversal}} {{is a line}} that passes through two lines in the same plane at two distinct points. Transversals {{play a role in}} establishing whether two other lines in the Euclidean plane are parallel. The intersections of {{a transversal}} with two lines create various types of pairs of angles: consecutive interior angles, <b>corresponding</b> <b>angles,</b> and alternate angles. By Euclid's parallel postulate, if the two lines are parallel, consecutive interior angles are supplementary, <b>corresponding</b> <b>angles</b> are equal, and alternate angles are equal.|$|E
5000|$|Converting {{the rake}} ratio to an angle {{requires}} {{the application of}} some basic trigonometry.

50|$|Congruence tests {{look for}} all pairs of {{corresponding}} sides {{to be equal}} in length, though except {{in the case of}} the triangle this is not sufficient to establish congruence (as exemplified by a square and a rhombus that have the same side length).

In either case equality of <b>corresponding</b> <b>angles</b> is also necessary; equality (or proportionality) of corresponding sides combined with equality of <b>corresponding</b> <b>angles</b> is necessary and sufficient for congruence (or similarity). The <b>corresponding</b> <b>angles</b> as well as the corresponding sides are defined as appearing in the same sequence, so for example if in a polygon with the side sequence abcde and another with the corresponding side sequence vwxyz we have vertex angle A appearing between sides a and b then its corresponding vertex angle V must appear between sides v and w.|$|E
