50|$|Upon {{receiving}} {{the contract to}} build the EMU in 1974, Hamilton United and ILC Dover delivered the first EMU units to NASA in 1982. During {{the research and development}} phase (1975-1980), a suit being tested caught fire, injuring a technician and forcing a redesign on the regulator and <b>circulation</b> <b>fan.</b> On STS-4 in July 1982, the astronauts practiced donning and doffing the suit in the Shuttle's airlock. The first Shuttle EVA was to occur on STS-5, but an electrical failure on the <b>circulation</b> <b>fan</b> forced the EVA to be cancelled. The first EVA of the new EMU finally occurred on STS-6 when Story Musgrave and Donald Peterson went out in the payload bay of the Space Shuttle Challenger and tested techniques to lower the launch cradle of a solid-fuel upper stage used to boost a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-A) into a geo-stationary orbit.|$|E
50|$|Unless the {{autoclave}} uses steam injection, the <b>circulation</b> <b>fan</b> {{carries the}} burden of assuring temperature uniformity throughout the working chamber. Since the heat flows from the source, whether electric resistance, steam coil, or firing tube, into the circulating air stream {{and then into the}} workload, the greater the airflow turbulence, the better the heat transfer, particularly with workloads that are heavy and dense.|$|E
50|$|Air can {{be passed}} over common, solid {{desiccants}} (like silica gel or zeolite) or liquid desiccants (like lithium bromide/chloride) to draw moisture from the air to allow an efficient mechanical or evaporative cooling cycle. The desiccant is then regenerated by using solar thermal energy to dehumidfy, in a cost-effective, low-energy-consumption, continuously repeating cycle. A photovoltaic system can power a low-energy air <b>circulation</b> <b>fan,</b> and a motor to slowly rotate a large disk filled with desiccant.|$|E

Facing the need to invest millions of dollars toward the purchase of new, mechanically cooled refrigerator cars, the Western Pacific chose instead to become a partner in the PFEs rival Fruit Growers Express in June of that year (which, at the time, controlled 24,000 mechanical reefers and 3,500 refrigerated tractor-trailer sets).|$|R

50|$|In some circumstances, when steam is {{available}} in the plant, considerable money may be saved by using live steam injection. In this approach, the entire interior of the autoclave is filled with live steam at the appropriate pressure. Commonly used in the rubber products industries, this can be adapted to use in curing composites. It requires different vacuum bagging materials but has the advantage of eliminating heaters, ducts, and the <b>circulation</b> <b>fan.</b> With external insulation, there is more room available for workloads, for a given size of pressure vessel. Naturally, this approach presupposes the availability of an appropriately rated boiler.|$|E
50|$|There are new non-compressor-based {{electrical}} {{air conditioning}} systems with a SEER above 20 coming on the market. New versions of phase-change indirect evaporative coolers use nothing but a fan and a supply of water to cool buildings without adding extra interior humidity (such as at McCarran Airport Las Vegas Nevada). In dry arid climates with relative humidity below 45% (about 40% of the continental U.S.) indirect evaporative coolers can achieve a SEER above 20, and up to SEER 40. A 100,000 BTU indirect evaporative cooler would only need enough photovoltaic power for the <b>circulation</b> <b>fan</b> (plus a water supply).|$|E
50|$|Although {{this does}} {{add to the}} initial price, well-designed {{autoclaves}} feature removable back ends which provide easy and unrestricted access to the hardware in the unheated area. It is difficult to realize how valuable this is until it is suddenly necessary to remove a sixty-horsepower motor that weighs well over half a ton through an opening just barely large enough for it to pass through. Some autoclaves have the <b>circulation</b> <b>fan,</b> complete with motor, mounted in an end-bell of reduced diameter. While this allows the assembly to be removed easily, {{it also means that}} the fan is undersized in diameter and thus less efficient.|$|E

50|$|An often {{overlooked}} aspect of autoclave access is the rear end. In many instances, the best autoclave {{is that which}} has two doors. In the typical industrial autoclave, there is mechanical hardware in the rear, including the <b>circulation</b> <b>fan</b> drive. An autoclave with a rear door will cost more initially. Over its service life, however, it will cost less to maintain, largely because the easy accessibility of components inside will encourage their more frequent inspection. In any autoclave, as in any machine, all major and minor components should be accessible for inspection, repair, and replacement. Overlook this, and the owner will eventually regret it.|$|E
50|$|A full-diameter non-fast-opening {{rear door}} costs little, all things considered. On larger machines, {{it can be}} mounted on a hinge, davit, or dolly {{assembly}} (see photo above) that allows it to be swung or {{moved away from the}} autoclave once its bolted flange mounting has been separated. This provides the best possible access to the works inside. It also means that critical components are never buried deep inside the machine where they are hard to get at and thus very likely to be ignored until they cause problems. One mid-sized autoclave built for a southern aircraft repair shop to be as cheap as humanly possible lacked easy access to the <b>circulation</b> <b>fan,</b> and, when last observed by one of the manufacturer's service engineers, was making the most alarming dry-bearing noises whenever it ran.|$|E
50|$|Since {{failure of}} the {{circulating}} fan will have immediate and unhappy consequences for the heat exchanger or heating elements, detection of <b>circulation</b> <b>fan</b> failure is vital. This {{can be done in}} several ways. First, monitor the surface temperature of the heater, whether coil or element. If the airflow fails, this will rise suddenly, and the control system can execute an immediate shut-off. Second, install at least one and preferably two airflow sensors. Since the airflow may be at very high temperatures, this can be done with remotely mounted pressure switches that connect to the high and low pressure sides of the fan by means of stainless steel tubing long enough to put the switches well inside the cool area of the inside of the vessel. These switches should be wired in series on one side for the control circuit, such that either one opening will disrupt the heater power, and in parallel on the other side so that the computer can detect which one has changed state.|$|E

5000|$|Clinton Machine Company {{manufactured}} small gasoline engines, and by 1956 {{they were}} the tenth largest employer in Iowa. They changed their name to Clinton Engines Corporation in 1958.

The company manufactured engines for washing machines, chain saws, outboard motors, industrial air <b>circulation</b> <b>fans,</b> and lawn mowers for a variety of companies. [...] It won the President's [...] "E" [...] Award in 1966. However, the Charnay Group failed to adequately support Clinton Engines financially, and it had to file for bankruptcy the same year. Clinton Engines was sold to Martin Hoffinger, a New York investor, who operated the company on a reduced basis. It was eventually downsized to produce spare parts for engine repairs. By 1999 there were only about 35 employees left. The plant was in disrepair when it closed that year. In 2000 the facility was donated to the city of Maquoketa, who tore down the factory and maintained the office building. The Jackson County Historical Society maintains the Clinton Engines Museum, the Jackson County Research & Family History Library, the JCHS Media Arts Center, the Clinton Engines Association, and a large program center in the building.|$|R
50|$|Some {{applications}} allow doing {{without the}} <b>circulation</b> <b>fan</b> and air heating altogether. If the parts being processed are fairly simply geometrically, {{it may be}} feasible to use molds which are themselves integrally heated. For example, it is feasible to manufacture flat and single-curvature light aircraft landing gear springs on inexpensive aluminum molds with electric heating pads bonded directly {{to the bottom of}} the mold. This eliminates the cost of the motor and fan as well as the air heaters and uses much less electricity than a comparable electric autoclave would require. In this way, the autoclave provides consolidation pressure alone. There are limitations to this approach, such as mold complexity. Sometimes, the parts are heated from one side only; sometimes, the mold has top and bottom parts, each fitted with heaters. Although not usually feasible in a job shop, this type of autoclave can afford significant savings when only a small range of comparatively simple parts is being made.|$|E

Thermal comfort test sessions are conducted in a test house representative of a typical UK house during the winter season. A total of 119 participants {{took part in the}} series of tests conducted in the test house’s living room. Operative temperature in the heated space was maintained within the comfortable range recommended by CIBSE for a living room area in a UK house. Two different heating emitters were used for heating during the tests in order to examine their effects on occupant thermal comfort. Conventional radiators supplemented by a gas boiler and an electric fan heater were investigated in the presence and absence of a <b>circulation</b> <b>fan</b> running {{in the corner of the}} room. Thermal comfort sensation of occupants was calculated using sensors installed in the living room (Fanger’s Predicted Mean Vote). At the same time the occupants were asked to fill in surveys which were used to record their Actual Mean Vote. From the test sessions conducted it was found that AMV predicted a neutral temperature of 23. 5 °C whilst PMV predicted a neutral temperature of 24. 0 °C thus PMV over predicted the occupant’s thermal sensation compared to AMV. For the four heating scenarios it was found that a convective fan heater with a <b>circulation</b> <b>fan</b> causes the smallest temperature gradient (1. 0 oC) between ankle and head height for a seated occupant according to ISO 7730 standards.

40|$|A {{human being}} spends {{approximately}} one-third of his/her life in sleep. Sleep {{can help people}} overcome tiredness, and {{is very important to}} one's memory. With the gradual understanding of the influence of thermal parameters in a sleeping environment on the quality of sleep, different thermal environmental control approaches, such as electric blankets, space heating for cold sleep environments and <b>circulation</b> <b>fans</b> and air-conditioning for hot sleep environments, have been used to maintain a suitable thermal environment for sleep, so that sleep quality could not be adversely affected. In this review paper, firstly, the concept of thermal comfort applicable to sleeping environments is introduced and the relevant studies reviewed. Secondly, the review of the two important issues related to air-conditioning for sleeping environments in tropics and sub-tropics, i. e., night-time space cooling load characteristics, and ventilation requirement for a sleeping person, is presented. Thirdly, different air-conditioning systems used in sleeping environments and these related energy consumptions are reviewed, with an emphasis on bed-based (task/ambient conditioning) TAC applicable to a sleeping environment, which could help save more energy without scarifying the thermal comfort of a sleeper and indoor air quality.

40|$|The thermal {{management}} of an outdoor electronic enclosure {{can be quite}} challenging due to the additional thermal load {{from the sun and}} the requirement of having an air-sealed enclosure. It is essential to consider the effect of solar heating loads in the design process; otherwise, it can shorten the life expectancy of the electronic product or lead to catastrophic failure. In this paper we analyze and compare the effectiveness of different cooling techniques used for outdoor electronics. Various cooling techniques were compared like special coatings and paints on the outer surface, radiation shields, double-walled vented enclosures, fans for internal air circulation and air-to-air heat exchangers. A highly simplified, typical outdoor system was selected for this study measuring approximately 300 x 300 x 400 mm (WxLxH). Solar radiation was incident on 3 sides of the enclosure. There were 8 equally spaced PCBs inside the enclosure dissipating 12. 5 W each uniformly (100 watts total). A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the system was built and analyzed. This was followed by building a mock-up of the system and conducting experiments to validate the CFD model. It was found that some of the simplest cooling techniques like white oil paint on the outer surface can significantly reduce the impact of solar loads. Adding internal <b>circulation</b> <b>fans</b> can also be very effective. Using air-to-air heat exchangers was found to be the most effective solution although it is more complex and costly.

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of the chilled beam system is its lower operating cost. For example, because the temperature of cooled water {{is higher than the}} temperature of cooled air, but it delivers the same cooling ability, the costs of the cooled water system are lower. Because cooling and heating of air are no longer linked to the delivery of air, buildings also save money by being able to run fewer air <b>circulation</b> <b>fans</b> and at lower speeds. One estimate places the amount of air handled at 25 to 50 percent less using chilled beam systems. By being able to target the delivery of clean outdoor air where it is needed (rather than injecting it into the entire system and heating or cooling it), there is a reduced need to treat large amounts of outdoor air (also saving money). In one case, the Genomic Science Building at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill lowered its HVAC costs by 20 percent with an active chilled beam system. This is a typical energy cost savings. Chilled beam systems also have some advantages in that they are almost noiseless, require little maintenance, and are highly efficient. Traditional fan-driven HVAC systems create somewhat higher air velocities, which some people find uncomfortable. Chilled beam HVAC systems also require less ceiling space than forced-air HVAC systems, which can lead to lower building heights and higher ceilings. Since they do not require high forced air flows, chilled beam systems also require reduced air distribution duct networks (which also helps to lower cost).|$|R
