40|$|Although {{commonly}} known as ladybugs in America, Entomologists prefer to call insects in the Coccinellids family as ladybird <b>beetles</b> or <b>lady</b> <b>beetles,</b> as these insects are not true bugs. There {{have been at least}} 138 species of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coccinellids) reported to be introduced into Hawaii, either intentionally or adventively, of which 87 of these species are known to be established (Nishida, 2002). <b>Lady</b> <b>beetles</b> have various sizes, colors, patterns on their hardened forewings (elytra), and even on their prey preference. They can be as small as 1 mm long like those in the genera of Stethorus (A) or can be 7. 5 mm long like the 7 -spotted (B). Some can have elytra with no patterns like the metallic blue <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (C), have strips like the three striped <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (D), or have halos around their spots like the 10 -spotted <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (E). The spots can be small (F), large (G), or oblong (H). The morphology of <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae can vary as much as the adults. Some can be mostly grey like the 7 -spotted <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (I), be strikingly colorful as seen with the 10 -spotted <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (J), be covered in white fluffy hairs like the globe-marked <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (K), or be spiky as seen with the genus Scymnus (L) and the minute 2 -spotted <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (M).

50|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that populations of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> {{can respond to}} increases in populations of soybean aphids in soybean. In addition, increases in populations of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> {{have the ability to}} inhibit colony growth of soybean aphids throughout the growing season. As generalist predators, <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are able to feed on alternate prey when soybean aphids are at low densities. Other characteristics of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> that are advantageous in times of soybean aphid scarcity include developmental delays of certain life stages, decreased body weights, and reduced clutch sizes. One of the most competitive <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> in North America, the multicolored Asian <b>lady</b> <b>beetle,</b> is of exotic origin. When soybean aphids are plentiful, an adult multicolored Asian <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> has the capacity to consume 160 soybean aphids per day.|$|R
50|$|Another {{group of}} predators that {{plays a key}} role in {{suppression}} of populations of soybean aphids in North America is lady beetles (Coccinellidae spp.). Some prevalent species in soybean include the twospotted lady beetle (Adalia bipunctata L.), the sevenspotted lady beetle (Coccinella septempunctata L.), the spotted lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata De Geer), the polished lady beetle (Cycloneda munda (Say)), the multicolored Asian lady beetle (Harmonia axyridis (Pallas)), the <b>convergent</b> <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville), and the thirteen spotted lady beetle (Hippodamia tredecimpunctata L.).|$|E

40|$|Toxicity of δ-phenothrin and {{resmethrin}} to non-target insects Frank B Antwi and Robert KD Peterson∗ BACKGROUND: The susceptibility {{of adult}} house cricket, Acheta domesticus (L.), adult <b>convergent</b> <b>lady</b> <b>beetle,</b> Hippodamia convergens (Guérin-Méneville), and larval fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (JE Smith), to resmethrin and δ-phenothrin synergized with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) was evaluated {{in a laboratory}} bioassay procedure. RESULTS: The 1 day LC 50 values for resmethrin+ PBOwere 23. 2, 32. 08 and 307. 18 ng cm− 2 for A. domesticus, H. convergens and S. frugiperda respectively. The 1 day LC 50 values for δ-phenothrin+ PBOwere 26. 9, 74. 91 and 228. 57 ng cm− 2 for A. domesticus, H. convergensandS. frugiperda respectively. Theregression relationshipbetweenspeciesmortalityandconcentrationexplained 51 – 81 %of the variation for resmethrin+ PBO and 72 – 97 %of the variation for δ-phenothrin+ PBO. The LC 50 values decreased with time for these insecticides for all surrogate species. In terms of sensitivities among the insects to resmethrin + PBO and δ-phenothrin+ PBO, A. domesticuswasmost sensitive, followed byH. convergens and then S. frugiperda. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that resmethrin + PBO was generally more toxic than δ-phenothrin + PBO. Based on the results, A. domesticus {{seems to be a}} good surrogate species for estimating potential non-target terrestrial insect impacts from exposure to pyrethroids used in public health applications...|$|E

40|$|Adults of <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> in {{the tribe}} Scymnini {{imported}} for biological control of hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae Annand, in eastern North America {{can be readily}} distinguished from native <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coccinellidae). The imported <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are in the genera Pseudoscymnus and Scymnus (Neopullus), {{both of which are}} Palearctic. These taxons have characteristics {{that can be used to}} separate them from Nearctic <b>lady</b> <b>beetles.</b> The most useful morphological feature is that the number of antennal segments is less than 11; ten-segmented in Scymnus (Neopullus) and ninesegmented in Pseudoscymnus. Elytral patterns and coloration also can be useful in field recognition. Larvae of the imported <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> are all in the tribe Scymnini, which can be distinguished from <b>lady</b> <b>beetles</b> in other tribes. A characteristic of the Scymnini is the wax covering of the last two larval instars and, for most species, the body lacks pronounced spines and is neither black or heavily sclerotized. Identification of a Scymnini larva to the genus level requires careful microscopic examination. Pseudoscymnus tsugae larval antennae have been described as onesegmented, but our examination indicates that they are two-segmented. Scymnus (Neopullus) larvae have three-segmented antennae.

40|$|The <b>convergent</b> <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (CLB), Hippodamia convergens (Guérin-Méneville), {{a species}} widely {{distributed}} {{and used in}} biological control, has exhibited high survival under field and laboratory conditions when treated with field rates of the pyrethroid λ-cyhalothrin, a highly unusual phenomenon for a natural enemy. This work investigated and characterized the phenomenon of pyrethroid resistance in a population of this species collected in Georgia, USA. The mechanism and level of resistance were evaluated by treating parental populations with λ-cyhalothrin ± piperonyl butoxide (PBO). The inheritance bioassay utilized parental crosses and backcrosses between parental populations to obtain testable progenies. Adult beetles from populations and progenies were topically treated with different doses of λ-cyhalothrin (technical grade) to calculate knockdown (KD) and lethal (LD) doses, and to investigate the dominance based on a single dose and whether resistance is autosomal and monogenic (null hypothesis). Genetic variation in the parental populations was examined by applying a discriminating dose for resistant individuals (0. 5 g/L). The data indicate that resistance is due to at least two factors: knockdown resistance and enzymatic detoxification of the insecticide. The knockdown effect is recessive and linked to the X-chromosome. Variability in proportions of individuals within families dying following knockdown indicated genetic variation in the resistant population. Further studies {{should be done to}} investigate the role of sex linked inheritance of resistance in the species and interactions of the various mechanisms involved in resistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{boll weevil}} (Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman) is {{currently}} under eradication in the U. S. The eradication program is implemented {{by means of}} area-wide applications of malathion ULV. Frequent applications of this insecticide result in high mortality of many beneficial insects, and {{a greater risk of}} secondary pest outbreaks. Notable among the latter are the outbreaks of beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua H?bner) and cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii Glover) in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in 1995. The present study (i) compared densities of beneficial and pest insect and spider populations between cotton fields in eradication and non-eradication areas; (ii) evaluated the use of beneficial cotton arthropod population densities as indicators of pest damage risks from cotton aphid, beet armyworm, bollworm (Helicoverpa zea Boddie), and other worms (Estigmene acrea Drury, Pseudoplusia includens Walker, and Trichoplusia ni H?bner); and (iii) evaluated the effects of malathion ULV on the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) a key arthropod predator in cotton agroecosystems. Studies were conducted in central Texas, in the vicinities of College Station and Dallas, during 2002 and 2003. Results showed that a majority of cotton predators were negatively impacted by malathion ULV applications. However, <b>convergent</b> <b>lady</b> <b>beetle</b> (Hippodamia convergens Gu?rin-M?neville) densities were greater in active eradication fields than inactive fields. Stepwise regression analyses identified densities of lacewing (Chrysoperla carnea Stephens) larvae and lady beetle larvae (H. convergens, Coleomegilla maculata De Geer, Harmonia axyridis Pallas, and Coccinella septempunctata L.) as predictors of cotton aphid density, and density of total spiders as predictors of bollworm density. Predictors of beet armyworm or other worm densities could not be determined. This study demonstrated malathion ULV was highly toxic to fire ants, and could repel ants from treated surfaces. Malathion ULV reduced the number of foraging fire ants in the cotton canopy for three weeks and reduced fire ant predation of beet armyworm eggs. Predictors of secondary pest densities have been suggested which, if utilized, may help to prevent the occurrence of secondary pest outbreaks under boll weevil eradication. Validation of these predictors should be preformed before implementing them into an eradication program...|$|E
