NY9A was <b>cut</b> <b>back</b> to the Lincoln Tunnel as a result. The extension of I-478 into Manhattan was eliminated following the collapse of part of the Elevated Highway in 1973, an event which led to the demolition of the highway south of 59th Street.

NY9A was shifted onto 12th Avenue, one of the surface streets that the Elevated Highway had run atop of, but was otherwise unaffected as the route's south end was initially kept at the Lincoln Tunnel.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Previous {{research}} has examined {{costs associated with}} progressive neurological illnesses, but has not examined predictors of economic pressure, or quality of life (QOL). The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the predictors of both economic pressure and QOL among people with a range of progressive neurological illness. Method: Participants were 257 people with motor neurone disease, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s. Results: High levels of <b>cut</b> <b>backs</b> in spending predicted economic pressure for all groups. Economic pressure predicted QOL at 12 -month follow-up for all groups except Parkinson’s. For Parkinson’s, predictors of QOL were long duration of illness, illness-related expenses and <b>cut</b> <b>backs</b> in spending. <b>Cut</b> <b>backs</b> in spending, and not income or expenses, were the most important predictor of economic pressure. QOL was predicted by high levels of economic pressure for most of the illness groups. Discussion: The implications of these findings are discussed. They suggest that <b>cut</b> <b>backs</b> in spending, as opposed to income and expenses, are important factors to focus on assisting people to adjust to the changes to their financial situation that frequently occurs after developing one of these progressive neurological illnesses. <br /...|$|R

As he had with his earlier buildings, Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design. From its completion until 1957, it was the tallest office building in London.|$|E
