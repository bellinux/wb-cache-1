5|$|In March 1854, {{the steamer}} Black Warrior {{stopped at the}} Cuban port of Havana on a regular trading route from New York City to Mobile, Alabama. When it failed to provide a <b>cargo</b> <b>manifest,</b> Cuban {{officials}} seized the ship, its cargo, and its crew. The so-called Black Warrior Affair was viewed by Congress {{as a violation of}} American rights; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soulé to the Spanish to return the ship served only to strain relations, and he was barred from discussing Cuba's acquisition for nearly a year. While the matter was resolved peacefully, it fueled the flames of Southern expansionism.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{are able}} to track the Osaarian vessel, finding a large 1,000-year-old sphere {{constructed}} out of a single alloy. Archer and his away team discover a series of habitat modules containing most of the stolen items. The crew also finds a <b>cargo</b> <b>manifest,</b> and Ensign Sato soon learns they had also recently attacked a Xindi ship. Archer once again confronts Orgoth, demanding {{to know everything about}} the Xindi. He then drags the Osaarian to an airlock, initiating the decompression cycle. Orgoth soon relents, revealing they downloaded the Xindi database, while providing the access codes to their computer. When the alien ship returns, Mayweather maneuvers Enterprise close enough for Sato to download the bulk of it. Archer sends Orgoth back to his people.|$|E
5|$|The three {{ships were}} the Italian 8,500-ton {{merchant}} vessel Duchessa d'Aosta, the second a large German tug Likomba, the third a diesel-powered barge Bibundi. Duchessa d'Aosta had a working radio which {{was considered a}} threat, {{with the potential to}} provide details of Allied naval movements. Her declared cargo was 3 million pounds of wool, 316,610 pounds of hides and skins, 1.3 million pounds of tanning materials, 4 million pounds of copra, 544,660 pounds of crude asbestos fibre and over 1.1 million ingots of electrolytic copper. The first page of the ship's <b>cargo</b> <b>manifest,</b> was not presented to the port authorities and the ship's captain refused to provide them with any details, which led to speculation it was also carrying arms or ammunition. In his visits to the island, SOE agent Leonard Guise kept the ships under observation, and in August 1941 submitted a plan to seize Likomba and disable Duchessa d'Aosta. Approval for the military operation in a neutral port was given by the Admiralty on 20 November 1941.|$|E

5|$|She is then tasked {{to escort}} Dr. Otto Schenker, an East German scientist, to England. Later on, as Cate and Dr. Schenker {{fly back to}} England, he is {{captured}} by H.A.R.M., led by Magnus Armstrong, who knocks Cate unconscious. Armstrong decides to spare Cate's life, believing {{that she is a}} fellow Scot. Cate awakens and is soon thrown from the plane as it explodes. After surviving the fall via parachute, Cate is later introduced to a new partner, Tom Goodman, a UNITY agent from the American branch. After meeting him in a nightclub in Hamburg, they are ambushed by H.A.R.M. but manage to escape. The nightclub is owned by a German singer named Inge Wagner, whom Cate suspects is connected with H.A.R.M. The two are then tasked to investigate a cargo freighter containing several suspicious chemical containers that UNITY believes are linked to Dr. Schenker. Cate gets in the freighter, and after taking photos of the containers, is knocked unconscious by Armstrong, who spares her life by locking her in a cargo hold, thus ignoring Wagner's insistence that she must be liquidated. As the freighter heads out to sea, it slowly begins to sink, due to a huge explosion. Wagner and Armstrong escape immediately, but Cate has to fight her way out of the bowels of the freighter. Because Cate could not obtain the required information, she and Tom must return to the sunken freighter to finish gathering intelligence aboard. Cate goes scuba diving, and after investigating the shipwreck and obtaining the captain's log and the <b>cargo</b> <b>manifest,</b> she is ambushed by H.A.R.M. divers sent from a submarine commanded by Armstrong and Wagner but manages to escape.|$|E

25|$|The fire onboard MSC Flaminia {{has again}} raised {{concerns}} about misdeclared cargo. Containers containing explosive or flammable materials are normally carried on the decks for safety, but if the <b>cargo</b> <b>manifest</b> is incorrect or falsified, they might be stowed inside the cargo holds where they create a potential hazard. The shipping company has confirmed that, according to the <b>cargo</b> <b>manifest,</b> the ship was not carrying calcium hypochlorite, a chemical compound responsible for several container ship fires in the 1990s, {{in any of the}} 2,876 containers on board the ship. Furthermore, the reluctance of any country to give permission for the ship to enter its coastal areas {{raised concerns about}} the vessel sinking or being intentionally scuttled in deep water. A similar situation resulted in a major oil spill in 2002 when the oil tanker Prestige broke in two and sank after French, Portuguese and Spanish governments refused to allow the ship to dock in their ports.|$|E

25|$|On Tuesday, February 7, 2006, a UPS Douglas DC-8 {{cargo plane}} {{suffered}} an in-flight cargo fire {{and made an}} emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport after filling with smoke. There were no injuries other than smoke inhalation affecting the crew, but the plane burned {{on the ground for}} hours into the night, though most of the cargo survived, the aircraft was a total loss, with multiple holes burned through the roof skin. According to the NTSB, the firefighting crew did not have adequate training on using their skin-piercing extinguishing equipment and not knowing how to open the main cargo door, attempted to force the handle and broke the latch, rendering the door unopenable. There were also difficulties in obtaining the <b>cargo</b> <b>manifest</b> to determine what if any hazardous materials were on board, due to confusion about protocol. However, despite these failings, the airport staff, including the firefighting staff, managed the incident successfully without injury or major disruption of the airport. The NTSB suspected lithium ion batteries were the source of ignition and made recommendations for more stringent rules and restrictions on their air transport, especially on passenger aircraft (unlike this one). For a cause of the incident, the NTSB focused on the delayed indication of fire by the required onboard fire detection system and criticized the standards to which such systems are tested, noting that the tests use an empty cargo hold and do not represent the real-world performance of the detection systems with the hold full of cargo, which significantly changes the flow patterns of hot air and smoke. The crew and air traffic control personnel were found to have behaved properly (with minor exceptions) and not to be at fault for the incident or its outcome.|$|E

In December 1911, as in New York City in December 1910, Mauretania broke loose from her moorings while in the River Mersey and sustained damage that caused the cancellation of her special speedy Christmas voyage to New York. In a quick change of events Cunard rescheduled Mauretanias voyage for Lusitania, which had just returned from New York, {{under the command of}} Captain James Charles. Lusitania completed Christmas crossings for Mauretania, carrying revellers back to New York. Mauretania was on a westbound voyage from Liverpool to New York, beginning 10 April 1912, and was docked at Queenstown, Ireland, {{at the time of the}} [...] disaster. Mauretania was transporting Titanics <b>cargo</b> <b>manifest</b> carried by registered mail. Travelling on Mauretania at the time was the chairman of the Cunard line, Mr A.A.

[...] In the spring of 1913 westbound transatlantic passage aboard Mauretania cost roughly $17 for third class passengers, as shown in the original ticket at right. [...] In July 1913 King George and Queen Mary were given a special tour of Mauretania, then Britain's fastest merchant vessel, adding further distinction to the ship's reputation. On 26 January 1914, while Mauretania was in the middle of annual refit in Liverpool, four men were killed and six injured when a gas cylinder exploded while they were working on one of her steam turbines. Damage to the ship was minimal; she was repaired in the new Gladstone drydock and returned to service two months later.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>cargo</b> <b>manifest</b> and {{a bill of}} lading {{may carry}} similar {{information}} and the concepts are not always clearly distinguished.
