According to the method, the electrical resistivity method of predicting <b>coal</b> <b>bump</b> was brought forward. Experiments results are as follows: (1) the resistivity of horizontal stratification are smaller than that of vertical stratification, (2) the electrical resistivity values of coal sample under unsaturated state amount to {{about half of the}} nature state values, (3) the electrical resistivity changes of coal samples in the uniaxial compression show that coal samples ’ electrical resistivity decreases with increasing uniaxial compression press, and begins to increase while reaching half of rupture press, and the electrical resistivity increase continuously if keeping on loading until rupture. Electric mechanism of loaded coal smaples and mechanics mechanism of <b>coal</b> <b>bump</b> were analyzed and gain the inherent relationship between the electrical resistivity changes and the fracture process of coal.

This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of destress blasting in coal mining. Information such as geology, rock properties, mining conditions as well as blasting parameters such as blasthole layout, hole length, explosive loading etc. are presented.

This Bureau of Mines report summarizes microseismic activity associated with face bumps and floor bursts in a deep, western U. S. coal mine.

In this circumstance, this paper focuses on the recent achievements in the mechanism and prevention techniques of coal bumps {{over the past five}} years in China. Based on theoretical analysis, laboratory experiment, numerical simulation and field test, the characteristics of coal bumps occurrence in China's coal mines were described, and the difference between coal bumps and rockbursts was also discussed. In addition, three categories of coal bumps induced by “material failure” were introduced, i. e. hard roof, floor strata and tectonic structures, in which the mechanism of coal bumps induced by geological structures was analyzed. This involves the bump liability and microstructure effects on bump-prone coal failure, the mechanism of coal bumps in response to fault reactivation, island face mining or hard roof failure. Next, the achievements in the monitoring and controlling methods of coal bumps were reviewed. These methods involve the incorporated prediction system of micro-seismicity and mining-induced pressure, the distributed micro-seismic monitoring system, energy absorption support system, bolts with constant resistance and large elongation, and the “multi-stage” high-performance support.

40|$|In mining of {{inclined}} coal seams in Tangshan {{coal mine}} of Kailuan group, gateways on {{either end of}} a panel were both typically located along the floor and a gateway pillar between adjoining panels was left unmined between adjacent panels to ensure stability, thus forming a planar mining system. According to the practice, however, {{it turned out that}} this conventional mining system has long-standing problems, such as face end support problems, <b>coal</b> <b>bumps,</b> sliding of mining equipment downhill, spontaneous combustions, support problems in development entries, etc. In view of this situation and based on the No. Y 294 panel, this paper analyzes an innovative mining technology in which the gateways on either end of a panel are located at different heights within the coal seam. For the adjacent panel, the gate development may be superposed on the development entry of the previous panel or may be offset with respect to it. Field data shows that the split-level layout of the longwall panel plays an effective role in control of overall stability of mining equipment in inclined coal seams. Physical modeling demonstrates that the new technology has many advantages in ground control. Under the condition without a pillar, development entry adjacent to the new panel is located in the de-stressed zone and stress concentration is significantly reduced with associated reduction in <b>coal</b> <b>bumps,</b> bursts and support problems which means less support and maintenance requirement and cost. Compared with the conventional rectangular pillar, the gateway pillar width in this new technology is effectively reduced when pillars have to be left unmined.

The primary field instrumentation at the site was three-dimensional, full waveform, autonomous microseismic arrays placed underground and on the surface in order to surround the active multi-panel longwall district. The purpose of these arrays was to help investigate the strata mechanics associated with the redistribution of stress and the associated gob formation of the longwall. Specifically, the seismic arrays {{were used to determine}} the timing and location of the failure in the strata surrounding the active mining. Overall 13, 000 seismic events were detected and located with on-site processing during the five months the panel was being mined, including a magnitude (ML) 4. 2 event. Of these, a smaller subset of 5, 000 well-located events was selected during post-processing to form a consistent data set for analysis in this paper. From this data set, it was observed that the seismic events generally occurred in advance of the longwall face, both above and below the panel, consistent with failure of the strata in the forward stress abutment zone. Also, the occurrence of the ML 4. 2 seismic event within 150 - 180 m (500 - 600 ft) of a deep cover longwall face with no associated bump caused a re-evaluation {{of the nature of the}} connection between seismic activity and <b>coal</b> <b>bumps...</b>|$|R

Multiple linear regression and numerical modeling analyses of geological and mining conditions were used to identify the most significant factors contributing to stress bumps in coal mines. Twenty-five factors were considered initially, including mechanical properties of strata, stress fields, face and pillar factors of safety, joint spacings, mining methods, and stress gradients. In situ strength was estimated in 12 coal seams where uniaxial compressive strength exceeded 2, 000 psi.

The test system was composed by a double-shear testing model and an acousto-optic monitoring system in association with a digital camera and an acoustic emission (AE) instrument. The tests can simulate the movement of activated faults and the sliding in coal-rock structure. In this regard, instable sliding conditions of coal-rock samples, sliding types under different conditions, displacement evolution law, and AE characteristics during sliding process were investigated. Several sliding types were monitored in the tests, including unstable continuous sliding, unstable discontinuous sliding, and stable sliding. The sliding types have close relation with the axial loads and loading rates. Larger axial load and smaller loading rate mean that unstable sliding {{is less likely to}} occur. The peak shear stress was positively correlated with the axial load when sliding occurred, whereas the displacement induced by unstable sliding was uncorrelated with the axial load. A large number of AE events occurred before sliding, and the AE rate decreased after stable sliding.

A nonlinear dynamical model, which is derived by considering the time-dependent property of the coal pillar, is used to study the physical prediction of coal bumps. An algorithm of inversion for determining the parameters of the nonlinear dynamical model is suggested for seeking the precursory abnormality from the observed series of roof settlement. A case study of the Muchengjian coal mine is conducted and its nonlinear dynamical model is established from the observation series using the algorithm of inversion.

The microseismic system consisted of both underground and surface geophones coupled through radio telemetry and a fiber-optic network to produce pseudo real-time detection and location of seismic events surrounding the coal seam. This was the first microseismic installation of this scope at a U. S. coal mine, and the system was intended to help determine the exact strata mechanics associated with the redistribution of stress and the associated gob formation at one of the U. S. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s deepest longwall mines. Overall, 5, 000 calibrated seismic events were recorded during the mining of one panel, including a Richter magnitude 4. 2 event which occurred inside of the array. Analysis of these events provides a number of notable insights into the rock mass behavior. For instance, the longwall panel was widened during the retreat process, and the mining-induced seismicity shows a distinctly different behavior between the start of the panel, the mining of the narrow part of the panel and the mining of the wider part of the panel. Also, in itself, the acquisition of the ML 4. 2 event was a major milestone in geomechanical and bump research. This {{is the first time that}} such an event has been recorded with this detail and accuracy at a bump-prone coal mine in the U. S. The analysis of this single event has set distinct new limits on the relationship between mining seismicity and <b>coal</b> <b>bumps...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since 1994, various {{mines in}} the US have cooperated with {{research}} {{scientists at the}} Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories to address issues related to verification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). The CTBT requires that no country may conduct any nuclear explosion in the future. While the CTBT is a significant step toward reducing the global nuclear danger, verifying compliance with the treat requires that the monitoring system be able to detect, locate and identify much larger numbers of smaller amplitude seismic events than had been required previously. Large mining blasts conducted world-wide will be of sufficient amplitude to trigger the monitoring system at the lower threshold. It is therefore imperative that research into the range various blasting practices employed, the relationship of yield to seismic magnitude, and identification of anomalous blasting results be performed. This paper will describe a suite of experiments funded by the Department of Energy and conducted by the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories {{in cooperation with the}} US mining industry. Observations of cast blasting, underground long wall generated <b>coal</b> <b>bumps,</b> stoping, and explosively induced collapse of room and pillar panels will be presented. Results of these dual use experiments which are of interest to the mining community will be discussed. These include (1) variation of amplitude of seismic energy at various azimuths from cast blasts, (2) identification of the extent of back failure following explosive removal of pillars, and (3) the use of single fired shots for calibration of the monitoring system. The wealth of information and discovery described in this paper {{is a direct result of}} mutual cooperation between the US Government and the US Mining Industry...|$|R
40|$|This Bureau of Mines {{study was}} {{conducted}} to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} <b>coal</b> mine <b>bump</b> problem and its effect on underground coal mining in the Eastern United States. To accomplish this, information was collected on the geologic conditions, mining techniques, and engineering parameters at five bump-prone mines. Two geologic conditions have been found to cause the occurrence of bumps in the Eastern United States: (1) relatively thick overburden and (2) extremely rigid strata occurring immediately above and below the mine coalbed. Additionally, the probability of bump occurrence is increased by certain mining practices that concentrate stresses during retreat mining, in areas where geologic conditions are conducive to bumps. Mining plans that permit the development of pillar line points or long roof spans that project over gob areas should be avoided because these features may contribute to the occurrence of bumps...|$|R
40|$|Surface and {{underground}} mining operations generate seismic ground motions which are created by chemical explosions and ground failures. It {{may come as a}} surprise to some that the ground failures (<b>coal</b> <b>bumps,</b> first caves, pillar collapses, rockbursts, etc.) can send signals whose magnitudes are as strong or stronger than those from any mining blast. A verification system that includes seismic, infrasound, hydroacoustic and radionuclide sensors is being completed as part of the CTBT. The largest mine blasts and ground failures will be detected by this system and must be identified as distinct from signals generated by small nuclear explosions. Seismologists will analyze the seismic records and presumably should be able to separate them into earthquake-like and non earthquake-like categories, using a variety of so-called seismic discriminants. Non-earthquake essentially means explosion- or implosion-like. Such signals can be generated not only by mine blasts but also by a variety of ground failures. Because it is known that single-fired chemical explosions and nuclear explosion signals of the same yield give very similar seismic records, the non-earthquake signals will be of concern to the Treaty verification community. The magnitude of the mine-related events is in the range of seismicity created by smaller nuclear explosions or decoupled tests, which are of particular concern under the Treaty. It is conceivable that legitimate mining blasts or some mine-induced ground failures could occasionally be questioned. Information such as shot time, location and design parameters may be all that is necessary to resolve the event identity. In rare instances where the legitimate origin of the event could not be resolved by a consultation and clarification procedure, it might trigger on On-Site Inspection (OSI). Because there is uncertainty in the precise location of seismic event as determined by the International Monitoring System (IMS), the OSI can cover an area of up to 1, 000 squared kilometers. In active mining districts this area could include several different mining operations. So, an OSI could be disruptive both to the mining community and to the US Government which must host the foreign inspection team. Accordingly, it is in the best interest of all US parties to try and eliminate the possible occurrence of false alarms. This can be achieved primarily by reducing the ambiguity of mine-induced seismic signals, so that even if these remain visible to the IMS they are clearly consistent with recognizable mining patterns...|$|R
40|$|<b>Coal</b> mine <b>bumps</b> {{involve the}} violent, rapid failure of coal and rock around a mine excavation. Deep coal mines with strong roof and floor rocks and high-stress {{conditions}} frequently experience face and rib bumps. The bump problem {{is becoming more}} severe as mining depth increases, prompting efforts to control high stress in advance of mining. This Bureau of Mines report presents {{a review of the}} most widely used methods to detect and destress high-stress zones along coal faces and an investigation of stress-related bump problems and destressing techniques at a cooperating mine. Geotechnical instrumentation and microseismic methods were used to better understand bump occurrences in underground coal mines. Laboratory tests of the drilling-yield method for high-stress detection were conducted to determine the correlation between the volume of cuttings obtained and the magnitude of the applied stress at various confining pressures. A three-dimensional, multiple-seam computer modeling program, MULSIM, was used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} stress-relief methods. Modeling results indicate that dangerously high-stress areas can be controlled by either proper planning or destressing. Proper mine planning guidelines and destressing methods such as volley firing, hydraulic fracturing, and auger drilling are discussed...|$|R
