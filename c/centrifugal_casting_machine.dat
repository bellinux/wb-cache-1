Gas (propane) - oxygen and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> electrical oven and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> and electrical oven - vacuum and press air were used to melt each alloy and cast the specimens. A stereo-microscope was used to scan the external porosity in conjunction with digital photography, in order to store imaging data. The surfaces of the specimens and the total area of the pores were measured using an image analysis program. Quantitative results from the conducted investigation have been analyzed using statistical methods, lending to the following conclusions: 1. There was no statistically significant difference in the total number of defects (pores) on the external surface of the specimens among the three groups of alloys treated by different melting and casting techniques. 2.

Methods and Materials: A titanium casting unit was used to cast PTi and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy specimens followed by A 3 shade low-fusing porcelain (Noritake) being bonded to them. Gold-based (AuA), palladium-based (PdA), and nickel-chromium (Ni-Cr) alloys were cast with an automatic <b>centrifugal</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine,</b> then A 3 shade conventional porcelain material (Vita, VMK 95) was applied to them. Ten specimens of each metal were then fabricated. The CIE L* a* b* color coordinates of the specimens were measured with a spectrophotometer. Results: All alloys had significant color changes when compared with A 3 shade tabs. The color differences from the shade tabs were 5. 79 for the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V group, 6. 46 for PdA alloy, 8. 12 for AuA alloy, 8. 15 for Ni-Cr alloy, and 12. 58 for PTi. The specimens differed from the shade tabs primarily because of the differences in a* and b* coordinate values.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the microhardness of Ni-Cr alloys used in fixed prosthodontics after casting under different conditions. The casting conditions were: (1 -flame/air torch) flame {{made of a}} gas/oxygen mixture and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> in a non-controlled casting environment; (2 -induction/argon) electromagnetic induction in an environment controlled with argon; (3 -induction/vacuum) electromagnetic induction in a vacuum environment; (4 -induction/air) electromagnetic induction in a non-controlled casting environment. The 3 alloys used were Ni-Cr-Mo-Ti, Ni-Cr-Mo-Be, and Ni-Cr-Mo-Nb. Four castings with 5 cylindrical, 15 mm-long specimens (diameter: 1. 6 mm) in each casting ring were prepared. After casting, the specimens were embedded in resin and polished for Vickers microhardness (VH) measurements in a Shimadzu HMV- 2 (1, 000 g for 10 s). A total of 5 indentations were done for each ring, one in each specimen. The data was subjected to two-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison tests (alpha = 0. 05). The VH values of Ni-Cr-Mo-Ti (422 ± 7. 8) were statistically higher (p 0. 05) and lower than the values obtained in the conditions induction/air and flame/air torch (p 0. 05). The microhardness of the alloys is influenced by their composition and casting method. The hardness of the Ni-Cr alloys was higher when they were cast with the induction/air and flame/air torch methods. Este estudo avaliou a microdureza de ligas de Ni-Cr usadas em prótese fixa fundidas sob diferentes condições. As condições de fundição foram: (1 -maçarico) chama composta por uma mistura de gás/oxigênio e centrífuga sem o controle do ambiente de fundição; (2 -indução/argônio) indução eletromagnética com o ambiente controlado com argônio; (3 -indução/vácuo) indução eletromagnética com o ambiente sob vácuo; (4 -indução/ar) indução eletromagnética sem o controle da atmosfera. Foram utilizadas três ligas: Ni-Cr-Mo-Ti, Ni-Cr-Mo-Be e Ni-Cr-Mo-Nb. Foram realizadas 4 fundições com 5 espécimes cilíndricos de 15 mm de comprimento (diâmetro de 1, 6 mm). Depois das fundições os espécimes foram embutidos e polidos para as mensurações de microdureza Vickers (VH) em um Shimadzu HMV- 2 (1. 000 g por 10 s). Um total de 5 indentações foram feitas por anel, uma em cada espécime. Os dados de VH foram avaliados pelos testes de ANOVA e Tukey (alfa = 0, 05) para contraste de média. A microdureza das ligas apresentou a seguinte ordem: Ni-Cr-Mo-Ti (422 ± 7, 8) > Ni-Cr-Mo-Nb (415 ± 7, 6) > Ni-Cr-Mo-Be (359 ± 10, 7), sendo diferentes entre si. Os valores obtidos nas condições indução/argônio e indução/vácuo foram semelhantes entre si (p > 0, 05) e menores que os obtidos nas condições indução/ar e maçarico, estes últimos semelhantes entre si (p > 0, 05). A microdureza das ligas é dependente da composição da liga e do método de fundição. A dureza das ligas de Ni-Cr foi maior quando fundidas nas condições indução/ar e maçarico...|$|E
40|$|Surgical {{implants}} {{are used}} for decades successfully and have proven to mobilize patients again quick, reliable and painless. An optimization of the life and safety of these implants is sought by the investigations in this work. The cellular sponge-structure of the implants formed with the titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 7 Nb offers two key advantages over smooth, solid implants:• An improved connection between bone and implant is formed by bone-ingrowth into the pores. • An approximation of the modulus of the titanium alloy to the bone material is achieved by structuring. Ti 6 Al 7 Nb alloy {{has not yet been}} used for such implants, because the processing of this material is highly demanding on the machines and processes. The relevance of this development project becomes obvious by the large number of research institutions that handle similar projects. Especially the investment casting process is suitable for the production of cellular structures because also highly complex geometries and undercuts can be realized. The Ti 6 Al 7 Nb alloy has both very good biocompatibility and strength. However, Titanium alloys generally melt at high temperatures, react with many elements and are not very suitable for casting. The mould material plays a critical role in titanium castings. The mould must be chemically and thermally resistant to the titanium melt and can withstand the high pressure and erosion during casting. The experimental work includes the development of casting technology, the characterization of the casting process and parts. Furthermore, the development and evaluation of a reaction inhibiting slurry from modified yttria is part of the experimental work. The characterization of the casting parts and casting parameters turned out the surface quality of castings to become a focus of the work. Investigations have shown that the processing of cellular Ti 6 Al 7 Nb to implants was possible with the centrifugal casting process. With this method, metallic sponges are reproducibly prepared with a pore size of 10 ppi. Here, the struts of the models are thickened with a layer of wax. An increase of the diameter to a minimum thickness of about 0. 5 mm and an associated curvature of the profile are recognized as a requirement for a complete and reproducible mould filling. The thickness and the shape of cross-sections in addition to the casting parameters determine the flow length of the metal. The operations have been carried out with a vacuum <b>centrifugal</b> <b>casting</b> <b>machine</b> specialized for titanium. This allows for very short cycle times at high rotational speeds and a high purity melting process. The experimental work shows that for casting Ti 6 Al 7 Nb the gating system must be designed meticulously. The solidification morphology and the small solidification range of the alloy limits the complete and reproducible form filling. The solidification of the alloy is mushy and therefore very susceptible to internal porosity. The sponge structure, which has alternating sections, could not be produced without microporosity in the thicker areas. Parallel to these experiments, simulations have been carried out on differently complex sponge models, among which has the model “Tetradodekaidron” proved the most suitable to simulate the process virtually. Various mould materials for casting Ti 6 Al 7 Nb are tested. The molten alloy is very reactive and interacts with many ceramic materials. Impurities in the surfaces of the castings were identified within these investigations, the so called α-case. This proved an obstacle to the bioactive coating applied by the project partners. To prevent the α-case during casting, a shell mould based on a modified yttrium oxide was prepared and examined. It could be shown that the emergence of alpha-case can be prevented. This front-layer slurry proves a long lifetime and its robustness...|$|E

The analysis of heat transfer in <b>centrifugal</b> <b>casting</b> is very complex due to rapid solidification, rotating mould, opaque mould and high temperature.
