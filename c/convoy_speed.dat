The British successfully executed the manoeuvre, and at 13:15 Linois opened fire on the lead ship—Royal George—under the command of John Fam Timmins. The Royal George and the next four ships in line, the Indiaman Ganges, Dance's Earl Camden, the Warley and the Alfred, all returned fire, Ganges initially attacking Royal George in error. Captain James Prendergrass in Hope, the next in line, was so eager to join the battle that he misjudged his speed and collided with Warley, the ships falling back as their crews worked to separate their rigging. Shots were then exchanged at long range for 43 minutes, neither side inflicting severe damage.|$|R

50|$|Seay {{joined the}} Army from Montgomery, Alabama in 1967, and by August 25, 1968 was {{serving as a}} Sergeant in the 62d Transportation Company (Medium Truck), 7th Transportation Battalion, 48th Transportation Group. On that day, a convoy of the 81 trucks escorted by eight Military Police gun jeeps left Long Binh Post for the 1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division at Tây Ninh Combat Base. Traveling at the {{mandated}} <b>convoy</b> <b>speed</b> of 20 mph, the convoy passed through the village of Ap Nhi. Approximately 11:45, a battalion sized enemy force opened fire from the Ben Chu Rubber Plantation on their right. The lead 30 5-ton cargo trucks escaped the kill zone, but the enemy set two fuel tankers on fire {{at the front of}} the convoy and two ammunition trailers on fire at the rear trapping the convoy in between. The enemy fire forced the crews of the trucks and gun jeeps to quickly dismount and take cover leaving their M60 machine guns on their jeeps. The enemy then made a concerted effort to destroy the radios and M-60s on the gun jeeps, but one MP managed to get to his jeep and put in a call for help about 15 minutes into the fight. Meanwhile, SGT Seay and SP4 David Sellman took cover behind the trailers of their rigs and fought back. Seay left the cover of his position several times to toss hand grenades back and was finally wounded in the wrist. The nearest mechanized infantry security forces approached with M113 armored personnel carriers but the intense enemy fire would not allow them to enter the kill zone, so they established casualty collection points at both ends of the kill zone. Truck drivers and MPs either fought in small pockets like Seay and Sellman or maneuvered to the safety of the ends of the convoy. Seay found LT Howard Brockbank and four other soldiers where they treated his wound. He continued to fight back enemy assaults until he died from loss of blood. The ambush lasted for over nine hours and for his actions during the battle, Seay was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
50|$|The chenillette {{was mainly}} {{allocated}} to the standard Infantry Regiments, the first on 10 September 1932. There were six chenillettes present in the Compagnie Hors Rang (the company not subordinated to any battalion, and serving as the regimental supply, maintenance and replacement unit) and three in the Compagnie Régimentaire d'Engins, the regimental heavy weapons support company. Their primary official function {{was that of a}} supply vehicle to provide frontline positions with ammunition and other necessities while under artillery fire. The light armour was sufficient to stop small shell fragments and rifle or machine-gun fire at ranges greater than 300 meters. The Renault UE could carry or tow approximately 1000 kg of supplies; this included 350 kg in the cargo bin and 600 kg in the trailer. Typical loads included 81 mm Brandt mortar ammunition, ammunition for the 25 mm Hotchkiss anti-tank gun or rifle and machine-gun ammunition. To indicate they were towing, the tractors would erect a small rectangular steel plaque on the roof showing a yellow triangle on a contrasting blue field. The remainder of the vehicle was normally painted a dull bronze green overall, not using the intricate three- or four-colour schemes typical of French armour of the time. The more exposed forward positions would be supplied by the tractors only; their bins, though small, could still hold a load of 150 25 mm rounds or 2,688 machine-gun rounds. Mortar and gun teams were expected to move their own weapons if the move was less than 1,000 meters, otherwise, they were loaded, two each, in UEs for longer movements; likewise four machine-guns would be loaded. The 25 mm gun could optionally be towed. As the tractors were too small to accommodate the weapon crews, these had to move behind, following the vehicles on foot; the piece commander during this procedure sat next to the chenillette driver to indicate the desired new position of his mortar or gun. This was in fact the only occasion that within the Infantry Regiments a second crew member was really present: the driver normally formed the entire crew, although an assistant driver was allocated. A chenillette was thus never permanently attached to an individual weapon system; each 25 mm gun e.g. had its own horse-team to pull it for normal transport. For longer distance moves, the chenillette would be normally loaded on a truck, with the Renault UK trailer and (on good roads) possible mortars or guns towed behind. The larger trailer was officially never part of such a tow; it was in short supply, with just one available for four tractors each (two in each regiment) and only used to remove these if they had broken down. In practice it was not uncommon to transport the smaller trailer on the truck, while using the larger to move the tractor, as the prescribed procedure lowered the <b>convoy</b> <b>speed</b> to 15 km/h.|$|E

The next afternoon, the LST disembarked 218 Army engineers and unloaded mine-clearing equipment to LCTs for transfer to the beach. At 1917, the LST beached and, over the next eight hours, unloaded the remaining 115 troops and the rest of her cargo of 52 trucks. Pulling off the beach on the morning of 9 June, LST-306 proceeded to Southampton, England for repairs. She remained there, waiting for an availability, until 17 June when she moved to Plymouth for repairs. With a new propeller in place on the 22nd, the LST moved to Portland Harbour on 26 June, loaded Army trucks and personnel, and carried them to Utah Beach the next day. After dropping them off, she returned to Southampton with 900 German prisoners.

The simulation interface is a Horizontal Display Center (HDC) which is very similar to a MEKO 200 class Frigate Combat Information Center's (CIC) HDC. The program uses Extensible Markup Language (XML) files for reading data for program scenarios; parameters are initialized before each run time begins. The simulation also provides all the output data at the end of run time for analysis purposes. The program user's goal, and the purpose of the program, is to decrease the number of successful attacks against surface vessels by changing the configuration parameters of the ASW screen, to reflect sonar policy, <b>convoy</b> <b>speed</b> or number of ships in the simulation.

40|$|A {{study of}} winter sea {{ice in the}} Kara Sea by {{satellite}} radar images {{was part of the}} project Arctic Demonstration and Exploratory Voyage [...] ARCDEV (EU contract WA- 97 -SC. 2192) which aimed to investigate the conditions for navigating a tanker vessel in severe winter ice conditions. In order to perform such ship navigation operations, an escorting icebreaker support as well as detailed information on the ice conditions is required. The study has demonstrated practical use of satellite radar data to support safe and efficient ice navigation. The ARCDEV expedition, which took place in April-May 1998, used near real-time ice information derived from both ERS- 2 and RADARSAT ScanSAR Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images during the most difficult ice conditions in 30 years. Prior to and during the voyage a total of 28 satellite SAR images were acquired, analysed and transferred to the convoy in digital form. Detailed analysis and ice type classification of the SAR images were performed onboard the icebreaker. The results of the analysis were used both in the strategic and the tactical planning of the convoy navigation operations. In general, the <b>convoy</b> <b>speed</b> increased by a factor of at least two in the drift ice, and the use of SAR data was even more efficient for the preparation of a sailing channel through the fast ice in the Ob estuary.
