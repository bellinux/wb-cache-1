40|$|The Inkjet {{printing}} {{technology is a}} direct patterning technique to deposit functional materials with high precision and accuracy. This deposition technology {{is often used to}} manufacture <b>conductive</b> <b>electrodes</b> for different active and passive electronic devices on flexible foils. It is an up-scalable process in terms of printing devices from low (via. Sheet-to-Sheet, S 2 S platform) to high (via. Roll-to-Roll platform) quantities. For manufacturing of these <b>conductive</b> <b>electrodes</b> and hence electronic devices through the R 2 R platform, a suitable post-treatment/curing methodology is very much desired. In this work, the focus is concentrated on the curing methodology using the Infra-red radiation for both the inkjet-printed <b>conductive</b> <b>electrodes</b> and insulator layer, for completing a “proof of concept” Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) electronic device structure over the R 2 R platform. A conductive silver nano-particle and a polymeric dielectric ink are used to print the top and bottom <b>conductive</b> <b>electrodes,</b> with a middle insulator layer for the MIM structure respectively. It is observed that not only the printed silver electrode layers (both top and bottom) can be cured {{with the help of the}} Infra-red radiation, but also the insulator layer. Additionally, the layers constituting the MIM device structure is cured with the conventional curing methodology which in this case is thermal curing using a convection oven. This curing procedure for the printed functional layers is generally performed for the S 2 S manufacturing process. The <b>conductive</b> <b>electrodes</b> are then electrically characterized by measuring the sheet resistance (on the foil and dielectric layer) as a function of the un-conventional Infra-red radiation and conventional oven curing methodologies. The cured layers for both the <b>conductive</b> <b>electrodes</b> and insulator layers are morphologically analyzed for the layer thickness and homogeneity. The electrical performance of the cured insulator in form of the obtained capacitance from the MIM passive device is compared for the two mentioned curing methodologies...|$|R

50|$|A {{half-cell}} is {{a structure}} that contains a <b>conductive</b> <b>electrode</b> and a surrounding conductive electrolyte separated by a naturally occurring Helmholtz double layer. Chemical reactions within this layer momentarily pump electric charges between the electrode and the electrolyte, resulting in a potential difference between the electrode and the electrolyte. The typical anode reaction involves a metal atom in the electrode dissolved and transported as a positive ion across the double layer, causing the electrolyte to acquire a net positive charge while the electrode acquires a net negative charge. The growing potential difference creates an intense electric field within the double layer, and the potential rises in value until the field halts the net charge-pumping reactions. This self-limiting action occurs almost instantly in an isolated half-cell; in applications two dissimilar half-cells are appropriately connected to constitute a Galvanic cell.|$|E

These conductive electrodes are usually glass covered with indium tin oxide (ITO) and a 40 nm sublayer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS). PEDOT and PSS help to smooth the ITO surface, decreasing the density of pinholes and stifling current leakage that occurs along shunting paths. Through thermal evaporation or sputter coating, a 20 to 70 nm thick layer of aluminum and sometimes an intermediate layer of lithium fluoride are then applied onto the photoactive material.

Compared to silicon-based batteries the Graetzel cells are rather simple and manufactured of low cost materials.First Graetzel cells discovered in 1991 were based upon porous layer of nanoparticles of titanium oxide covered with organic dye.

In 2009, Japanese scientists managed to make a breakthrough and transfer from an organic pigment in the cells to hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite materials, and in 2012, they managed to replace liquid electrolyte by solid organic semiconductor. At that, a new class of devices, the so-called [...] "perovskite solar cells" [...] has emerged.
