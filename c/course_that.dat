5|$|Aged 17, Braham {{applied for}} a short service {{commission}} in the RAF, a <b>course</b> <b>that</b> lasted for five years. The commission was designed to find young aviation enthusiasts with the right physical and academic qualities to become flying officers. To Braham's surprise, his application was accepted. His commission was dated 7 March 1937. His service number was 40667. The commission enabled Braham to enter at the rank of pilot officer. His training mainly consisted of an introduction to flying by civilian organisations contracted {{to do so by}} the RAF. Successful candidates advanced to military training.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the highway}} {{was taken over by}} the state of New York in the 1910s and 1920s. In 1908, the section of modern NY250 in Fairport between Church and High Streets became part of Route20, an {{unsigned}} legislative route assigned by the New York State Legislature. The definition of the route was altered in 1921, taking the route on a more southerly <b>course</b> <b>that</b> used the portion of what is now NY250 between NY31 and NY31F instead through eastern Monroe County. NY250 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E

5|$|Quamby {{house was}} built for Sir Richard Dry in 1838, {{probably}} to a design by Richard Cromwell Carpenter. It was built mostly by convict labour, using locally made clay bricks, in an American Colonial style, a single storey with a stone-flagged long veranda. The original estate was broken up {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. Quamby was opened for tourism, by Tasmanian Premier David Bartlett on 4 October 2009. It is operated as the Quamby Golf and Country Club, and has a par 38 9-hole golf <b>course</b> <b>that</b> dates from the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There {{was a heavy}} swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly <b>course</b> <b>that</b> brought them {{to the edge of the}} pack ice on 4 February.|$|E
5|$|Serge, the game's protagonist, is a 17-year-old {{boy with}} blue hair {{who lives in}} the fishing village of Arni. One day, he slips into an {{alternate}} world in which he drowned ten years before.

He is assisted by Kid, a feisty, skilled thief who seeks the mythical Frozen Flame. Portrayed as willful and tomboyish due to her rough, thieving past, she helps Serge sneak into Viper Manor in order to obtain the Frozen Flame. Kid vows to find and defeat Lynx, an anthropomorphic panther who burned down her adopted mother's orphanage.|$|E
5|$|The First Chicago Marathon was run on September 23, 1905. That {{first race}} began in Evanston and {{finished}} {{in front of}} a standing-room-only paying crowd at Washington Park race track. In a stunning upset, a reported 100,000 or more spectators watched Rhud Metzner come from behind to steal a late-race victory from the favored Louis Marks. With that first race, the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s on a revised <b>course</b> <b>that</b> largely resembles today's marathon route. Over the years elite fields included Olympic champions, world records were continually sought, and the marathon continued to inspire Chicago communities and spectators until challenges of the early 1920s sidelined the event.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} {{outcomes in}} deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) students and nondisabled students taking courses by distance learning with the UK Open University in 2012. DHH {{students who had}} no additional disabilities {{were more likely to}} complete their courses than nondisabled students, and they were just as likely to pass the <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> they completed and to obtain good grades on the <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> they passed. DHH students who had additional disabilities were less likely to complete their courses, less likely to pass the <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> they completed, and less likely to obtain good grades on the <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> they pass than were nondisabled students. It is concluded that hearing loss per se has no effect on academic attainment, but that additional disabilities may have an impact on DHH students’ academic performance...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{introduced}} to A.G. Spalding, the sporting goods manufacturer, Bendelow's career {{began to take}} off in earnest. Prior to this, he had been teaching golf in his spare time—most notably to the Pratt family of Standard Oil fame, who also commissioned him to build them a private six-hole course at their Long Island estate, but Spalding hired him to exclusively promote {{the game in the}} New York and New Jersey areas. [...] "They were not seeking to design and build championship courses or courses to test the honed skills of the best players, but rather <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> new players could enjoy, <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> would improve player proficiency, <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> would promote participation, and <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> could be maintained at a reasonable expense," [...] according to the American Society of Golf Course Architects.|$|R
25|$|The <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> {{a student}} takes {{depending}} on program and orientation {{can be divided}} into four levels: core subjects, program-specific subjects, orientation subjects, and individually selected courses. Core <b>courses</b> are <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> everyone, regardless of program, must study to satisfy the requirements for a student degree. Program-specific courses are the additional <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> a student is required to take to fulfill the program requirements. If a student for some reason does not fulfill the requirements, for example, by electing to replace a program-specific course with another course, the student is considered to have attended a specially designed program, which has no bearing except for what's printed on the school leaving certificate. Orientation subjects are the <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> a student elects to take by selecting an orientation. Normally these courses take place {{in the second and third}} year, although in a few cases the courses start earlier. Finally, individually selected <b>courses</b> are <b>courses</b> <b>that</b> the student freely selects for herself/himself in the second and third year; specific slots have been set aside in the curriculum and the schedule for these.|$|R

5|$|The {{king was}} {{reluctant}} to shed blood, and this greatly irritated the ultra-reactionary Chamber of Deputies, who felt that Louis XVIII was not executing enough.

5|$|Though Brownlee {{was no more}} {{enthusiastic}} than Reid about deficits, his continued confidence in his Provincial Treasurer was evidenced by his decision to give him yet another ministerial portfolio. In 1930 Brownlee secured Alberta's long-sought control over its natural resources from the federal government, and he appointed Reid Alberta's first Minister of Lands and Mines on 10 October 1930. In this capacity, Reid favoured private over public ownership. He opposed calls from his own party to promote government-developed hydroelectricity projects, and viewed the provincially owned railways as a burden to the government, though they finally turned a profit in 1927. He was a leading advocate of selling them to private interests, a <b>course</b> <b>that</b> was eventually followed in 1929.|$|E

Anna van der Breggen led the World Cup standings as the racing moved to China for the Tour of Chongming Island, with 290 points, but her Rabo-Liv team were not invited {{to take part in}} the event.
