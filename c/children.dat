5|$|Attachment {{disorders}} tend {{to occur}} in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, {{in the presence of}} repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all <b>children</b> raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on <b>children</b> from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized <b>children,</b> regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that <b>children</b> in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized <b>children</b> and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized <b>children</b> continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness.

50|$|There are {{two goals}} in Floortime: (1) follow the <b>child’s</b> lead, and (2) bring the <b>child</b> into a shared world.

The rationale here is that a <b>child</b> feels closer to someone who shows respect for the <b>child’s</b> interests and participates in them. Once a <b>child</b> enjoys having us participate with him/her, we can then begin to help the <b>child</b> toward greater development.

5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of <b>children</b> from Eastern European orphanages {{indicate}} that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in <b>children</b> adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments.

The quality of attachments that these <b>children</b> form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized <b>children</b> exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among <b>children</b> who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers.
