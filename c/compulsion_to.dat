5|$|Pardelup Prison Farm {{opened in}} 1927, near Mount Barker, while Barton's Mill, though {{planned to be}} a {{temporary}} measure, remained open as a prison after World War II. Pardelup operated as a working farm, with a large-scale dairy, cattle and pig raising, and crops, and Barton' Mill prisoners cut timber to supply hospitals, houses, and the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme's pumping station at Mundaring. In both cases, the only aspects resembling a prison were the presence of guards, and the <b>compulsion</b> <b>to</b> remain there – enforced by the remoteness of the facilities {{and the integrity of}} prisoners chosen to be transferred there. Escapees were generally punished with extended sentences at the harsher Fremantle Prison, which had little change over the four decades from 1920 to 1960.|$|E

No document or law indicated the exemption of a mixed marriage from some persecutions and especially of its Jewish-classified spouse. Thus on an eventual arrest, non-arrested relatives or friends had to prove the exceptional status, hopefully fast enough to rescue the arrested from eventual deportation.|$|R
25|$|People rely on compulsions as {{an escape}} from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the {{intrusive}} thoughts will soon return. Some people use <b>compulsions</b> <b>to</b> avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on {{the context in which}} the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while <b>compulsions</b> tend <b>to</b> disrupt it.|$|R
25|$|Drug {{addiction}} {{is a complex}} set of behaviors typically associated with misuse of certain drugs, developing over time and with higher drug dosages.

25|$|The World Health Organization's {{classification}} system defines a manic episode as one where mood {{is higher than}} the person's situation warrants and may vary from relaxed high spirits to barely controllable exuberance, accompanied by hyperactivity, a <b>compulsion</b> <b>to</b> speak, a reduced sleep requirement, difficulty sustaining attention and often increased distractibility. Frequently, confidence and self-esteem are excessively enlarged, and grand, extravagant ideas are expressed. Behavior that is out of character and risky, foolish or inappropriate may result from a loss of normal social restraint.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} and exchange of knowledge are inextricably linked <b>to</b> different <b>compulsions</b> <b>to</b> corporeal proximity and therefore travel. As primary producers and transferors of knowledge, academics {{are no exception}} to this rule, and their <b>compulsions</b> seem <b>to</b> be further propelled by institutional discourses regarding the alleged virtues of “internationalization. ” Tenured academics, moreover, have {{a high degree of}} independence and can therefore easily choose how <b>to</b> cope with <b>compulsions</b> and constraints <b>to</b> internationalize. However, the business-travel literature has paid scant attention to academics and their individual contexts. In an effort to rectify this situation, this paper explores a travel dataset of tenure-track academics (N= 870) working at Ghent University. The insights emerging from this analysis are then contextualized by complementing them with in-depth interviews of tenured academics (N= 23) at the same institution. This paper argues, first, that varying compulsions and constraints at home and abroad lead to distinct non-travel and travel-intensive academic roles. And second, that academics who have difficulties coping, try to rationalize their corporeal travel behaviour and their mobility behaviour to meet the needs and expectations to internationalize. These strategies give an indication of how travel-related working practices can become more efficient and sustainable in the future...|$|R

25|$|Lee {{perceived}} that McClellan {{was no longer}} a threat to him on the Peninsula, so he felt no <b>compulsion</b> <b>to</b> keep all of his forces in direct defense of Richmond. This allowed him to relocate Jackson to Gordonsville to block Pope and protect the railroad. Lee had larger plans in mind. Since the Union Army was split between McClellan and Pope and they were widely separated, Lee saw an opening to destroy Pope before returning his attention to McClellan. Believing that Ambrose Burnside's troops from North Carolina were being shipped to reinforce Pope, and wanting to take immediate action before those troops were in position, Lee committed Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to join Jackson with 12,000 men, while distracting McClellan to keep him immobilized.|$|E
25|$|Art {{certainly}} cannot advance under <b>compulsion</b> <b>to</b> traditional forms, {{and nothing}} {{in such a}} field is more stifling to progress than limitation {{of the right to}} experiment with a new technique. The foolish judgments of Lord Eldon about one hundred years ago, proscribing the works of Byron and Southey, and the finding by the jury under a charge by Lord Denman that the publication of Shelley's Queen Mab was an indictable offense are a warning to all who have to determine the limits of the field within which authors may exercise themselves. We think that Ulysses is a book of originality and sincerity of treatment and that it has not the effect of promoting lust. Accordingly it does not fall within the statute, even though it justly may offend many.|$|E
25|$|Greater Manchester {{bus stops}} were {{replaced}} {{over a five-year}} period.

GMPTE inherited their own M shaped logo and also began to use it on the glass back of bus shelters from the late 1990s. They have subsequently introduced this to a new design for bus stop flags – firstly used in 2002 on high priority routes – and now being erected across the entire GMPTE area.|$|E
50|$|Compulsive {{gambling}} {{is characterized by}} having the desire to gamble {{and not being able}} to resist said desires. The gambling leads to serious personal and social issues in the individual’s life. This compulsive behavior usually begins in early adolescence for men and between the ages of 20-40 for women. People who have issues controlling <b>compulsions</b> <b>to</b> gamble usually have an even harder time resisting when they are having a stressful time in life. People who gamble compulsively tend to run into issues with family members, the law, and the places and people they gamble with. The majority of the issues with this compulsive behavior are due to lack of money to continue gambling or pay off debt from previous gambling. Compulsive gambling can be helped with various forms of treatment such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Self-help or Twelve-step programs, and potentially medication.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} Thomas De Quincey’s opium use as {{a product}} of social strain. De Quincey’s collection of work provides evidence that he felt alienated from society prior to his addiction and that his feelings of inadequacy contributed to his dependence on drugs. Utilizing Robert K. Merton’s strain theory, this thesis delineates De Quincey’s aspirational references and perceived failures through an examination of his imagery and interprets his perceptions of human life as a catalyst for his <b>compulsions</b> <b>to</b> cope with opium. De Quincey, strained by the aspirations of an industrial and imperialistic society, looked for several avenues of escape. The Romanticism of William Wordsworth presented De Quincey with a method for alleviating social strain; however, when De Quincey failed to discover the transcendence evident in Lyrical Ballads he turned to the intoxicating effects of opium and retreated from English society...|$|R

25|$|Referred itch is the {{phenomenon}} {{in which a}} stimulus applied in one region {{of the body is}} felt as an itch or irritation in {{a different part of the}} body. The syndrome is relatively harmless, though it can be irritating, and healthy individuals can express symptoms. Stimuli range from a firm pressure applied to the skin – a scratch – to irritation or pulling on a hair follicle on the skin. The referred sensation itself should not be painful; it is more of an irritating prickle leading to the <b>compulsion</b> <b>to</b> scratch the area. The stimulus and referred itch are ipsilateral (the stimulus and the referred itch occur on the same side of the body). Also, because scratching or putting pressure on the referred itch does not cause the stimulus area to itch, the relationship between the stimulus and the referred itch is unidirectional. The itching sensation is spontaneous and can cease with continued stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Psychoanalysis, a psychotherapeutic {{approach}} to behavior change developed by Sigmund Freud and modified by his followers, has also offered {{an explanation of}} substance abuse. This orientation suggests {{the main cause of}} the addiction syndrome is the unconscious need to entertain and to enact various kinds of homosexual and perverse fantasies, {{and at the same time}} to avoid taking responsibility for this. It is hypothesised specific drugs facilitate specific fantasies and using drugs is considered to be a displacement from, and a concomitant of, the <b>compulsion</b> <b>to</b> masturbate while entertaining homosexual and perverse fantasies. The addiction syndrome is also hypothesised to be associated with life trajectories that have occurred within the context of traumatogenic processes, the phases of which include social, cultural and political factors, encapsulation, traumatophilia, and masturbation as a form of self-soothing. Such an approach lies in stark contrast to the approaches of social cognitive theory to addiction—and indeed, to behavior in general—which holds human beings regulate and control their own environmental and cognitive environments, and are not merely driven by internal, driving impulses. Additionally, homosexual content is not implicated as a necessary feature in addiction.|$|E
25|$|Heraclea was {{certainly}} {{at this time}} in alliance with the Tarentines and Lucanians against Rome; and it was doubtless with the view of detaching it from this alliance that the Romans were induced shortly afterwards (278BCE) to grant to the Heracleans a treaty of alliance on such favorable terms that it is called by Cicero prope singulare foedus. Heraclea preserved this privileged condition throughout the period of the Roman Republic; and hence, even when in 89BCE the Lex Plautia Papiria conferred upon its inhabitants, in common with the other cities of Italy, the rights of Roman citizens, they hesitated long whether they would accept the proffered boon. We hear that Heraclea surrendered under <b>compulsion</b> <b>to</b> Hannibal in 212BCE. We have no account of the part taken by Heraclea in the Social War; but from an incidental notice in Cicero, that all the public records of the city had been destroyed by fire at that period, it would seem to have suffered severely. Cicero nevertheless speaks of it, in his defence of the poet Aulus Licinius Archias (who had been adopted as a citizen of Heraclea), as still a flourishing and important town, and it appears to {{have been one of the}} few Greek cities in the south of Italy that still preserved their consideration under the Roman dominion. Its name is unaccountably omitted by the 2nd century AD geographer Ptolemy; but its existence at a much later period is attested by the Antonine Itinerary and the Tabula Peutingeriana. It was still a place of some importance under the empire; a branch road from Venusia joined the coast road at Heraclea.|$|E
