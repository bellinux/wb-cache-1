In such cases, {{it is important to}} transmit specialized knowledge to local residents precisely.

Then the theoretical backgrounds of each domain are discussed. The second part of the article introduces <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> as an instrumental activity for effective organizational action in today’s business environment. Several examples of business constellations in which <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> is crucial are offered. A definition is proposed as well as a description of the different modes of <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication.</b> In order to understand what happens in the ‘black-box’ of <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication,</b> the problems characterizing communication between experts and decision makers are presented. In discussing the conceptual and theoretical background of the two fields, links to other disciplines are made – e. g. sociology, organizational sciences, cognitive and behavioral psychology and engineering sciences –, highlighting the multidisciplinary approach that characterizes corporate <b>communication</b> and <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication.</b> In the conclusion it is claimed that both fields contribute to the strategy development processes and that concepts in <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> provide useful insights to the field of corporate communication, both on the strategic and tactical levels...|$|R

To realize this, agents need more detailed concrete message to be transferred. But what should be transferred? How to transfer necessary message to improve the receiver’s understanding capability and not add too much communication load? In this paper, We put forward a <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> definition and <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> protocol to solve this problems. We build <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> protocol stack and KC 2 A 2 P protocol ontology for content and context awareness. Based on such model, we utilize SRC algorithm to obtain the semantic relativity value and realize mutual awareness and understanding in communication.

We outline why this perspective is important and we show where and when <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> matters. After an overview of typical <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> situations in management, we define <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> and differentiate it from other types of professional communication. We do so by showing that what is communicated differs from regular communication contexts, as well as how one communicates. We then review 26 existing theoretical concepts that describe barriers to <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication.</b> We relate these constructs to results obtained from 7 focus groups with engineers and IT experts and 30 interviews with managers and consultants. Based on our findings, we categorize typical <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> problems between experts and managers into five groups: expert-caused, manager-caused, reciprocal mistakes, situation-caused, and organizational barriers. As a synthesis, we propose a structural model of the drivers of <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> quality.

Multiculturalism increases communities' hopes of reducing racism and increasing productivity. Diversity training, however, is receiving negative criticism. Still, effective communication is viewed as critical, and training in this area is encouraged. Cultural understanding and communication skills provide frameworks for developing tolerance and acceptance. This study was conducted to provide more applied research to the area of multicultural diversity with applications to business and education. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the influence of listening/nonverbal communication training on an individual's level of multicultural sensitivity and listening/nonverbal <b>communication</b> <b>knowledge.</b> This study investigated the relationships between (a) communication training and multicultural sensitivity, (b) communication training and <b>communication</b> <b>knowledge,</b> and (c) the interrelationships between communication training, multicultural sensitivity, and <b>communication</b> <b>knowledge</b> as influenced by major area of study and gender. The study was conducted with two intact sections of business writing within the College of Business and two intact sections of educational philosophy within the College of Education. The researcher randomly assigned the four classes to groups, which resulted in 40 students in the control group and 34 students in the experimental group. The researcher administered pre- and posttests to all subjects to assess the changes in their levels of multicultural sensitivity and <b>communication</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The training aspect of this study included two experiential exercises that addressed listening/nonverbal communication. Data generated from the pre- and posttests were analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test. A statistically significant relationship was found between the training and multicultural sensitivity at the. 05 level. Although no significant relationship between the training and <b>communication</b> <b>knowledge</b> was found, a positive change was shown in mean scores for both the experimental and the control groups between the pre- and posttests. Major area of study and gender were not significant issues when considering the influence of communication training on multicultural sensitivity and <b>communication</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Based on the conclusions, recommendations for curriculum development and further research were developed. Business educators and executives need to provide training in diversity issues and also to establish academic and work environments that support tolerance and acceptance...|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} dissertation thesis called "The Role of <b>Communication</b> in the <b>Knowledge</b> Management" strives to identify the relationship between <b>communication</b> and <b>knowledge</b> management and results in finding that communication plays a critical role both in implementation of knowledge management and in the phase when knowledge management is implemented. The communication can shape environment for knowledge management as well as can be a tool for knowledge sharing. The research {{was focused on the}} situation of implemented knowledge management where the role of communication interferes to both the environment and the knowledge sharing. The research is based on three case studies that describe <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> and its context in three similar successful and recognized organizations. Facts identified in the case studies are analyzed and discussed with experts in the area of personnel management and internal communication. Findings from the empirical research create basis for the design part which is aimed at identifying the way how to leverage the role of <b>communication</b> in <b>knowledge</b> management and how to use it to positively contribute to knowledge management goals. It results in a proposed system of tools of internal <b>communication</b> that supports <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication.</b> The system prefers face-to-face communication but includes also other tools of internal communication. The system is put into a broader context which is built out of knowledge management strategy, organizational culture and internal communication. There are recommendations defined for each of the elements that should support the right function of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication.</b> Rules and guidance for the <b>knowledge</b> <b>communication</b> are part of the thesis as well.

Process-innovation teams are considered to be powerful tools inside organizations to cope with this necessity. Their performance is of major importance for most MNCs. As a response to the increasing internationalization and globalization of markets, these teams show a growing culturally diverse composition. This article focuses on two major processes that are discussed to decide about a positive or a negative performance of a team: intra-team <b>communication</b> style and <b>knowledge</b> transfer. Explicitly, this article (1) tests for the influence of cultural diversity on intra-team <b>communication</b> and <b>knowledge</b> transfer, and (2) empirically examines the impact of the openness of intra-team <b>communication</b> and <b>knowledge</b> transfer on the performance of multicultural teams. A quantitative empirical survey among 84 team-members of 20 culturally diverse teams within a German sportswear company is used to test the relationships.
