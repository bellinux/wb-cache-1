40|$|After {{publication}} {{we discovered}} {{an error in}} the identification of the origin of the <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> reported in our article in BMC Biotechnology (2010, 10 : 50), entitled "Ao 38, a new <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> from eggs of the black witch moth, Ascalapha odorata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is permissive for AcMNPV infection and produces high levels of recombinant proteins". Upon analysis of primary A. odorata cultures, we found that they were contaminated with cells of Trichoplusia ni origin. The origin of the Ao 38 <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> was determined as T. ni using three marker genes and the Ao 38 <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> was renamed BTI-Tnao 38. References to the origin of the <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> as Ascalapha odorata should be replaced with "a <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> of Trichoplusia ni origin". The absence of TNCL virus detection in the BTI-Tnao 38 (Ao 38) <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> was confirmed using a highly sensitive RT-PCR protocol capable of detecting TNCL virus RNA at approximately 0. 018 copies/cell. Because of these observations, we have revised the title of the original article to "Correction: BTI-Tnao 38, a new <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> derived from Trichoplusia ni, is permissive for AcMNPV infection and produces high levels of recombinant proteins" and two additional authors were added to reflect their contributions to the analysis of this <b>cell</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R

40|$|Flavonoids are phytochemicals {{characterized}} by {{a wide range of}} biological activities, including antioxidant activity, the ability to modulate enzyme or cell receptor activity patterns, and to interfere with essential biochemical pathways. Using HeLa cells of a human cervical carcinoma, and their drug-resistant HeLa CK subline, the effects of three structurally related flavonoids (quercetin, fisetin and luteolin) have been examined, in terms of their: (i) cytotoxicity, (ii) influence on intracellular glutathione (GSH) level, (iii) influence on glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, and (iv) influence on the expression of apoptosis-related genes (PARP, Bcl- 2, survivin). Fisetin was more toxic to resistant HeLa CK <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> than to parental <b>cell</b> <b>line,</b> causing decreased expression of survivin in the same <b>cell</b> <b>line.</b> Concentrations of 5 μM of the examined flavonoids caused PARP degradation in parental <b>cell</b> <b>line,</b> leading HeLa <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> into apoptotic <b>cell</b> death. The same event was not determined in the resistant <b>cell</b> <b>line.</b> Fisetin and luteolin induce glutathione and GST in the resistant <b>cell</b> <b>line,</b> pointing to complex cellular effects which could be responsible for higher sensitivity of the resistant <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> in comparison with the parental <b>cell</b> <b>line.</b> Prooxidative nature of the investigated flavonoids was not detected, so free radical formation is not responsible for the induction of GSH, GST and proapoptotic enzymes...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} a 6 -year-old girl with linear streaks of {{apparent}} hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation following the Blaschko lines, growth retardation, bupthalmos of the left eye, and mild mental retardation. She had a 45,X karyotype in lymphocytes. In cultured fibroblasts a double aneuploidy mosaicism was detected, consisting of a <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> with trisomy for chromosome 7 and a <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> with monosomy for the X-chromosome and no <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> with a normal karyotype. Cutis tricolor or three levels of pigmentation in different skin areas suggested presence of a third, probably normal <b>cell</b> <b>line.</b> Double aneuploidy mosaicism of a <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> with monosomy X and a <b>cell</b> <b>line</b> with trisomy of an autosome is a rare finding.

These provide an unlimited source of homogenous self-replicating material, free of contaminating stromal cells, and often easily cultured in simple standard media. The first breast cancer cell line described, BT-20, was established in 1958. Since then, and despite sustained work in this area, the number of permanent lines obtained has been strikingly low (about 100). Indeed, attempts to culture breast cancer <b>cell</b> <b>lines</b> from primary tumors have been largely unsuccessful. This poor efficiency was often due to technical difficulties associated with the extraction of viable tumor cells from their surrounding stroma.
