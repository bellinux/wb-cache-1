The invention uses a reference balance {{aligned with the}} balance being calibrated to provide superior accuracy while minimizing {{the time required to}} complete the calibration. The reference balance and the test balance are rigidly attached together with closely aligned moment centers. Loads placed on the system equally effect each balance, and the differences in the readings of the two balances can be used to generate the calibration matrix for the test balance. Since the accuracy of the test calibration is determined by the accuracy of the reference balance and current technology allows for reference balances to be calibrated to within +/- 0. 05 % the entire system has an accuracy of +/- 0. 2 %. The entire apparatus is relatively small and can be mounted on a movable base for easy transport between test locations. The system can also accept a wide variety of reference balances, thus allowing calibration under diverse load and size requirements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Leveraging {{techniques}} {{pioneered by}} the SLAM com-munity, {{we present a}} new filtering approach called simultaneous compliance and registration estimation or CARE. CARE is like SLAM in that it simultaneously determines the pose of a surgical robot while creating a map, but in this case, the map is a compliance map associated with a preoperative model of an organ {{as opposed to just}} positional information like landmark locations. The problem assumes that the robot is forcefully contacting and deforming the environment. This palpation has a dual purpose: 1) it provides the necessary geometric information to align or register the robot to a priori models, and 2) with palpation at varying forces, the stiffness/compliance of the environment can be computed. By allowing the robot to palpate its environment with varying forces, we create a <b>force</b> <b>balanced</b> <b>spring</b> model within a Kalman filter framework to estimate both tissue and robot posi-tion. The probabilistic framework allows for information fusion and computational efficiency. The algorithm is experimentally evaluated using a continuum robot interacting with two bench-top flexible structures. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A {{spring is}} an elastic or {{resilient}} body whose {{function is to}} deflect or deform when a load is applied and recover its original shape when the load is removed. The important applications of springs are in {{application of a force}} clutches brakes etc. measurement of a <b>force</b> <b>spring</b> <b>balance</b> storing energy clocktoy springs and absorbing shocks and vibrations springs in vehicle suspension systems. Fatigue loads are generally cyclic and fluctuating in nature and are much less in magnitude than the yield strength of materials but they tend to have unpredictable behavior due to dissimilar and brutal fracture patterns. To avoid this determining the endurance limit becomes inevitability. The present paper aims to test the endurance limit {{of a wide range of}} coiledcompression springs in the smallest possible time frame using a screw-based modified slider-crank mechanism in a mechanical system...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{method of}} <b>calibrating</b> a wind-tunnel <b>force</b> <b>balance</b> {{involves the use}} of a unique load application system integrated with formal experimental design methodology. The Single-Vector <b>Force</b> <b>Balance</b> Calibration System (SVS) overcomes the productivity and accuracy limitations of prior calibration methods. A <b>force</b> <b>balance</b> is a complex structural spring element instrumented with strain gauges for measuring three orthogonal components of aerodynamic force (normal, axial, and side force) and three orthogonal components of aerodynamic torque (rolling, pitching, and yawing moments). <b>Force</b> <b>balances</b> remain as the state-of-the-art instrument that provide these measurements on a scale model of an aircraft during wind tunnel testing. Ideally, each electrical channel of the balance would respond only to its respective component of load, and it would have no response to other components of load. This is not entirely possible even though balance designs are optimized to minimize these undesirable interaction effects. Ultimately, a calibration experiment is performed to obtain the necessary data to generate a mathematical model and determine the force measurement accuracy. In order to set the independent variables of applied load for the calibration 24 NASA Tech Briefs, October 2003 experiment, a high-precision mechanical system is required. Manual deadweight systems have been in use at Langley Research Center (LaRC) since the 1940 s. These simple methodologies produce high confidence results, but the process is mechanically complex and labor-intensive, requiring three to four weeks to complete. Over the past decade, automated balance calibration systems have been developed. In general, these systems were designed to automate the tedious manual calibration process resulting in an even more complex system which deteriorates load application quality. The current calibration approach relies on a one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) methodology, where each independent variable is incremented individually throughout its full-scale range, while all other variables are held at a constant magnitude. This OFAT approach has been widely accepted because of its inherent simplicity and intuitive appeal to the balance engineer. LaRC has been conducting research in a "modern design of experiments" (MDOE) approach to <b>force</b> <b>balance</b> calibration. Formal experimental design techniques provide an integrated view to the entire calibration process covering all three major aspects of an experiment; the design of the experiment, the execution of the experiment, and the statistical analyses of the data. In order to overcome the weaknesses in the available mechanical systems and to apply formal experimental techniques, a new mechanical system was required. The SVS enables the complete calibration of a six-component <b>force</b> <b>balance</b> with a series of single force vectors...|$|R
25|$|However, because Arnold's <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> patents were {{in force}} (each for 14 years), Earnshaw could {{not use the}} helical <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> until the 1775 patent lapsed in 1789, and, {{in the case of}} the 1782 patent, 1796. Until around 1796, Earnshaw made watches with flat <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> only, but post 1800, {{practically}} every marine chronometer, including those by Earnshaw, had a helical spring with terminal overcoils.|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> to the <b>balance</b> wheel around 1657 by Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens greatly increased the accuracy of portable timepieces, transforming early pocketwatches from expensive novelties to useful timekeepers. Improvements to the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> are responsible for further large increases in accuracy since that time. Modern <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> are made of special low temperature coefficient alloys like nivarox to reduce the effects of temperature changes on the rate, and carefully shaped to minimize the effect of changes in drive force as the mainspring runs down. Before the 1980s, balance wheels and <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> were used in virtually every portable timekeeping device, but in recent decades electronic quartz timekeeping technology has replaced mechanical clockwork, and the major remaining use of <b>balance</b> <b>springs</b> is in mechanical watches.|$|R

25|$|Even {{though he}} {{produced}} a number of pocket timekeepers, from around 1772-1778, Arnold was still experimenting with different types of compensation balance and methods of <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> adjustment. The most difficult problem to surmount was the problem of making an effective and continuously adjustable temperature compensation device. For technical reasons, the temperature compensation for the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> had to somehow {{be incorporated into the}} balance itself and not act on the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> directly as had been done previously by Arnold and others.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> {{is a fine}} spiral or helical {{torsion spring}} used in {{mechanical}} watches, alarm clocks, kitchen timers, marine chronometers, and other timekeeping mechanisms to control the rate of oscillation of the balance wheel.

The <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> and <b>balance</b> wheel together form a harmonic oscillator, which oscillates with a precise period or [...] "beat" [...] resisting external disturbances, and is responsible for timekeeping accuracy.|$|R

50|$|An {{increase}} in temperature increases {{the dimensions of}} the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> and the <b>balance</b> due to thermal expansion. The strength of a spring, the restoring force it produces in response to a deflection, is proportional to its breadth and the cube of its thickness, and inversely proportional to its length. An {{increase in}} temperature would actually make a spring stronger if it affected only its physical dimensions. However, a much larger effect in a <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> made of plain steel is that the elasticity of the spring's metal decreases significantly as the temperature increases, the net effect being that a plain steel spring becomes weaker with increasing temperature. An increase in temperature also increases diameter of a steel or brass balance wheel, increasing its rotational inertia, its moment of inertia, making it harder for the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> to accelerate. The two effects of increasing temperature on physical dimensions of the <b>spring</b> and the <b>balance,</b> the strengthening of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> and the increase in rotational inertia of the balance, have opposing effects and to an extent cancel each other.

500|$|The {{invention}} of the mainspring in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> {{was added to the}} balance wheel in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist Robert Hooke (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens was the actual inventor of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring.</b> Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral <b>balance</b> <b>spring,</b> the form used in virtually all watches to the present day. [...] The addition of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> made the <b>balance</b> wheel a harmonic oscillator like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed resonant frequency and resisted oscillating at other rates. [...] This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day, resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France.|$|R
5000|$|There is some dispute as {{to whether}} it was invented around 1660 by British {{physicist}} Robert Hooke or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, with the likelihood being that Hooke first had the idea, but Huygens built the first functioning watch that used a <b>balance</b> <b>spring.</b> [...] Before that time, balance wheels or foliots without springs were used in clocks and watches, but they were very sensitive to fluctuations in the driving force, causing the timepiece to slow down as the mainspring unwound. The introduction of the <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> effected an enormous increase in the accuracy of pocketwatches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10 minutes per day, making them useful timekeepers for the first time.

5000|$|Due to his {{relationship}} with the scientist Robert Hooke he made some of the first watches with <b>balance</b> <b>springs,</b> these had the potential to be much more accurate than earlier watches. Several different kinds were experimented with, including an early type with double balances geared together in order to eliminate errors of motion. One of these was made for King Charles II and was signed [...] "Robert Hooke invent. 1658. T. Tompion fecit, 1675". William Derham mentions this in his book The Artificial Clockmaker. This watch, it seems, has not survived. The final form of <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> arrangement used by Tompion was a plain spiral with a single balance, indeed the same arrangement employed by Christiaan Huygens in watches made for him by Thuret. A few of Tompion's early spiral <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> movements were also of a similar specification to the Huygens/Thuret pattern as they had a standing barrel and no fusee. Huygens imagined that the latter would not be necessary as the spiral spring would render the balance isochronous. Tompion must have soon found this rather optimistic surmise was however incorrect, as all Tompion's subsequent spiral <b>balance</b> <b>spring</b> movements have fusees, and this design became the standard pattern in English watches throughout the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|R
