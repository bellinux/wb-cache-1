30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to classify the risk level of the epileptic patients from the EEG signals. The aim is to obtain high classification rate, performance index, quality value with low false alarm, and missed classification. Due to the nonlinearity obtained and also the poor performance found in the <b>code</b> <b>converters,</b> an optimization was vital for the effective classification of the signals. We opted SVD, EM, and MEM as postclassifiers. Morphological filters were also used for the feature extraction of the EEG signals. After having computed the values of PI and QV discussed under the results column, we found that SVD was working perfectly with a high classification rate of 91.22 % and a false alarm as low as 1.42. Therefore, SVD was chosen to be the best postclassifier. The accuracy of the results obtained can be made even better by using extreme learning machine as a postclassifier, and further research will be in this direction.|$|R

40|$|Brain {{activity}} patterns {{differ from}} person to person, even for an identical stimulus. In functional brain mapping studies, {{it is important to}} align brain activity patterns between subjects for group statistical analyses. While anatomical templates are widely used for inter-subject alignment in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, they are not sufficient to identify the mapping between voxel-level functional responses representing specific mental contents. Recent work has suggested that statistical learning methods could be used to transform individual brain activity patterns into a common space while preserving representational contents. Here, we propose a flexible method for functional alignment, "neural <b>code</b> <b>converter,</b> " which converts one subject's brain activity pattern into another's representing the same content. The neural <b>code</b> <b>converter</b> was designed to learn statistical relationships between fMRI activity patterns of paired subjects obtained while they saw an identical series of stimuli. It predicts the signal intensity of individual voxels of one subject from a pattern of multiple voxels of the other subject. To test this method, we used fMRI activity patterns measured while subjects observed visual images consisting of random and structured patches. We show that fMRI activity patterns for visual images not used for training the converter could be predicted from those of another subject where brain activity was recorded for the same stimuli. This confirms that visual images can be accurately reconstructed from the predicted activity patterns alone. Furthermore, we show that a classifier trained only on predicted fMRI activity patterns could accurately classify measured fMRI activity patterns. These results demonstrate that the neural <b>code</b> <b>converter</b> can translate neural codes between subjects while preserving contents related to visual images. While this method is useful for functional alignment and decoding, it may also provide a basis for brain-to-brain communication using the converted pattern for designing brain stimulation...|$|E

The new system architecture is presented in details where an all-optical methodology for cancelling multiple access interference is proposed. Performance evaluation of the proposed system in both MAC and optical layers is introduced where the overall burst error rate of the system is evaluated in three cases: full, partial, and no code conversion capabilities taking into account the receiver dark current, thermal, and shot noises at the egress nodes. Our results reveal that a considerable improvement in the performance of each core node in the system is achieved by using SAC-OCDMA instead of WDM in the optical layer underneath an OBS based MAC layer. We also conclude that a slight increase in the employed number of <b>code</b> <b>converters</b> enhances the overall system performance noticeably.
