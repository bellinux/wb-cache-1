The CICE is a summary measure of an entity’s (e. g., a region’s) <b>creative</b> <b>capacity</b> or capability in three key dimensions: Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Openness. To develop the CICE we use an innovative method {{to determine the}} weights used to “add-up” {{the information contained in}} the data on the three dimensions. Our method – endogenous weighting – allows each entity (e. g., region) to have its own set of the weights, which are chosen to maximize the entity’s CICE score value. We use our endogenous weight methodology to benchmark the <b>creative</b> <b>capacity</b> of nine regions: Baden-Württemberg, Catalonia, Flanders, Lombardy, Maryland, Nord-Pas-De-Calais, Quebec, Rhône-Alpes, Scotland. Our analysis shows that Baden-Württemberg ranks highest in terms of <b>creative</b> <b>capacity</b> while Nord-Pas- De-Calais ranks lowest. Among the nine regions, Flanders ranks 3 rd in <b>creative</b> <b>capacity</b> behind 2 nd ranked Maryland. However, Flanders’ rank masks that its CICE score value is 25 % below that of Baden-Württemberg and 11 % below that of Maryland, indicating a non-trivial gap in <b>creative</b> <b>capacity</b> between Flanders and “best practice. ”Creative economy, innovation, entrepreneurship...|$|R

5000|$|Under {{the more}} modern {{understanding}} {{of the concept of}} genre as [...] "social action" [...] à la Miller, a more situational approach to genre is enabled. This situational approach frees genre from the classification system, genre's [...] "tyranny of genre". Relying on the importance of the rhetorical situation in the concept of genre results in an exponential expansion of genre study, which benefits literary analysis. One literature professor writes, [...] "The use of the contemporary, revised genre idea social action is a breath of fresh air, and it has opened important doors in language and literature pedagogy" [...] (Bleich 130). Instead of a codified classification as the pragmatic application of genre, the new genre idea insists that [...] "human agents not only have the <b>creative</b> <b>capacities</b> to reproduce past action, such as action embedded in genres, but also can respond to changes in their environment, and in turn change that environment, to produce under-determined and possibly unprecedented action, such as by modifying genres" [...] (Killoran 72).|$|E

For example, during a work's development, Meneley follows a deliberate routine of being open to public input and commentary, so that the background research and the artwork is in part a product of engaged dialog.

40|$|This {{research}} projects combines a systematic literature review and qualitative {{interviews with the}} goal of discovering how community-based arts organizations that serve youth living homeless foster and facilitate <b>creative</b> <b>capacity,</b> resilience and well-being for participants. Literature was analyzed based on its relevance to issues related to the experience of youth homelessness and marginalization, <b>creative</b> <b>capacity,</b> community arts organizations, or some combination of the three. Next, data from qualitative interviews suggest specific factors necessary for fostering and facilitating <b>creative</b> <b>capacity.</b> These include the importance of environment when working with youth living homeless, nuances in demographics and culture within street existence, sustainability of the organization, personal factors of identity and resilience building, and community connections and pathways out of homelessness. Factors of the organizational model were examined based on product and skill development versus process oriented frameworks. It was found that both models offer important resources for participants, but no model can meet the needs of everyone. Another critical factor drawn from the data is the importance of anti-oppressive practices that are rooted in the strengths of participants and participatory models of service delivery...|$|R

The Guardian's John Fordham observed [...] "The American star charges through this 100-minutes-plus gig with such an emphasis on repeat notes, brusque segues and thundering counterpoint that its feverish density gets close to overpowering at times. But Mehldau's quirky covers are as compelling as ever". PopMatters Associate Music Editor John Garratt said [...] "Through his choice to cover the likes of Oasis and Soundgarden, his crossover endeavors into classical and pop-jazz territory, and all of those pesky Bill Evans comparisons, it’s easy to forget that Brad Mehldau is a soulful interpreter and damn fine pianist. Top tier. If Live in Marciac doesn’t convince you, I don’t know what will" [...] On All About Jazz, John Kelman noted [...] "Live in Marciac stands out as a signpost on Mehldau's evolutionary path, and proves that, far from coasting on the considerable laurels on which he could easily rest, he's continuing to grow as a writer and an interpreter—but, most importantly, as a performer, as he leaps from one significant plateau to the next". JazzTimes reviewer, Thomas Conrad commented [...] "The <b>creative</b> <b>capacities</b> of the most important jazz piano player of his generation herein receive their most comprehensive documentation to date".|$|E

40|$|<b>Creative</b> <b>capacity</b> in {{the field}} of {{regional}} sciences means the capability of any region to generate knowledge and thus to achieve innovation and the diffusion of the output of the innovative activity while obtaining the viability and sustainability of this process. Although <b>creative</b> <b>capacity</b> studies mainly focus on urban regions, the late rural studies and empirical evidences showed that rural region has a great potential capacity in terms of its five components viz. knowledge; innovation; entrepreneurship; creativity; and networks. But, these opportunities have shown by a rural specific approach rather than an urban approach. On this basis, by taking into consideration these discussions in the literature, we assume that the rural <b>creative</b> <b>capacity</b> can be evaluated by the recent changes in rural regions that show the capability of rural regions to exploit its knowledge as an output. On this purpose, in this study, we aim to evaluate which component is relatively important to identify the level of rural <b>creative</b> <b>capacity.</b> Therefore, the study focuses on 60 villages from Europe and 17 villages from Turkey by deploying the data obtained from the in-depth questionnaires. This study is a first attempt at settlement level with an optimistic approach to measure the opportunities lying at the heart of rural regions. The results of the study showed that creativity in terms of traditions is the most important component in both cases while European villages have more opportunities and do not have the latent rural problems while Turkish villages are still suffering from the well-known rural problems that their capacity exists but it is very limited...|$|R
