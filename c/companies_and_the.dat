5|$|The District Railway (DR) was a sub-surface {{underground}} railway {{which had}} opened in 1868.

5|$|During this period, Colt {{received}} an extension on his patent {{since he did}} not collect {{on it in the}} early years. In 1852, gun makers James Warner and Massachusetts Arms infringed on the patent. Colt sued the <b>companies</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> court ordered that Warner and Massachusetts Arms cease revolver production. Colt then threatened to sue Allen & Thurber over the cylinder design of their double-action pepperbox revolver. However, Colt's lawyers doubted that this suit would have been successful and the case was resolved with a settlement of $15,000. Production of Allen pepperboxes continued until the expiration of Colt's patent in 1857. In 1854 Colt fought for his patent extension with the U.S. Congress, who launched a special committee to investigate charges that Colt had bribed government officials in securing this extension. By August he was exonerated and the story became national news when Scientific American reported that the fault was not with Colt, but with Washington politicians. With a virtual monopoly, Colt sold his pistols in Europe, where demand was high due to tense international relations. By telling each nation that the others were buying Colt's pistols, Colt was able to get large orders from many countries who feared falling behind in the arms race.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Boddingtons {{bought the}} Oldham Brewery for £23million, hoping to combine Oldham's {{strength}} in lager and keg bitter {{with their own}} expertise in cask ales. After the acquisition, the company owned 272 public houses, 70 per cent of which were within 20 miles of its Manchester brewery. In 1983, Boddingtons Bitter was distributed in the Home Counties for the first time. In 1985 Boddingtons paid £27.5million for the 160,000 barrel capacity Higsons Brewery in Liverpool and its tied estate of 160 public houses to form a combine with a £65million turnover. The Guardian commented {{that the company had}} paid mere asset value for Higsons as the company had been reporting poor profits. There was virtually no overlap between the two <b>companies,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> takeover brought Boddingtons to Merseyside for the first time. By this time Strangeways was producing only two beers, a bitter and a mild, with bitter constituting over 90 per cent of production. In 1986, the company employed 280 people and operated 530 tied houses, and while Strangeways Brewery had a capacity of 500,000 barrels a year, it was operating at around 50 per cent capacity. That year the company introduced its own lager, brewing Kaltenberg under licence.|$|E
5|$|In December 1939, {{soon after}} the {{outbreak}} of World WarII, King joined the RAAF as a squadron leader. Initially considered for general flying duties, he was assigned training commands commencing in the new year. On 2January 1940, he became the inaugural commanding officer of No.3 Elementary Flying Training School (No.3 EFTS) in Essendon, Victoria. Part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme, No.3 EFTS initially comprised a significant civilian presence, many of the aircraft and staff under King's control being from private airline <b>companies</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Royal Victorian Aero Club; by July, all private machines had been pressed into RAAF service and the civilian element largely disappeared. King assumed command of No.5 Elementary Flying Training School at Narromine, New South Wales, on 21December. Promoted to wing commander, he took over No.1 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, from Group Captain John McCauley on 7July 1941.
