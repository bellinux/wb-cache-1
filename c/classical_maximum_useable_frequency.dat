40|$|AbstractThe {{international}} reference ionosphere (IRI) {{model is}} generally accepted standard ionosphere model. It describes the ionosphere environment in quiet state and predicts the ionosphere parameters {{within a certain}} precision. In this paper, {{we have made a}} breakthrough in the application of the IRI model by modifying the model for regions of China. The main objectives of this modification are to construct the ionosphere parameters foF 2 and M (3000) F 2 by using the Chinese reference ionosphere (CRI) coefficients, appropriately increase hmE and hmF 2 height, reduce the thickness of F layer, validate the parameter by the measured values, and solve the electron concentration distribution with quasi-parabolic segment (QPS). In this paper, 3 D ray tracing algorithm is constructed based on the modified IRI model and international geomagnetic reference field (IGRF) model. In short-wave propagation, {{it can be used to}} predict the electromagnetic parameters of the receiving point, such as the receiving area, <b>maximum</b> <b>useable</b> <b>frequency</b> (MUF) and the distribution of the group delay etc., which can help to determine the suitability of the communication. As an example, we estimate the group delay distributions around Changchun in the detection from Qingdao to Changchun using the modified IRI model and IGRF model, and provide technical support for the short-wave communication between the two cities...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} South African National Defence Force (SANDF) {{has changed}} {{considerably}} in the last decade. The emphasis has moved from protecting the country's borders to peacekeeping duties in Central Africa and even further North. Communications between the peacekeeping missions and the military bases back in South Africa is vital to ensure {{the success of these}} missions. Currently use is made of satellite as well as High Frequency (HF) communications. There are drawbacks associated with these technologies (high cost and low data rates/interference respectively). Successful long distance ionospheric propagation in the low Very High Frequency (VHF) range will complement the existing infrastructure and enhance the success rate of these missions. This thesis presents a feasibility study to determine under what ionospheric conditions such low VHF communications will be possible. The International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) was used to generate ionospheric data for the reflection point(s) of the signal. The peak height of the ionospheric F 2 layer (hmF 2) was used to calculate the required antenna elevation angle. Once the elevation angle is known it is possible to calculate the required F 2 layer critical frequency (foF 2). The required foF 2 value was calculated by assuming a <b>Maximum</b> <b>Useable</b> <b>Frequency</b> (MUF) of 20 % higher than the planned operational frequency. It was determined that single hop propagation is possible during the daytime if the smoothed sunspot number (SSN) exceeds 15. The most challenging requirement for successful single hop propagation is the need of an antenna height of 23 m. For rapid deployment and semi-mobile operations within a jungle environment it may prove to be a formidable obstacle...|$|R
40|$|Airframe {{assemblers}} {{have long}} recognised {{that for a}} new aircraft to be successful it must use less fuel, have lower maintenance requirements, and be more affordable. One common tactic {{is the use of}} innovative materials, such as advanced composites. Composite materials are suited to structural connection by adhesive bonding, which minimises the need for inefficient mechanical fastening. The aim of this PhD project was to investigate the application of existing, yet immature Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques to adhesively bonded composite aerospace structures. The PhD study focused on two emerging SHM technologies - frequency response and comparative vacuum monitoring (CVM). This project aimed to provide missing critical information for each technique. This included determining sensitivity to damage, repeatability of results, and operating limitations for the frequency response method. Study of the CVM technique aimed to address effectiveness of damage detection, manufacture of sensor cavities, and the influence of sensor integration on mechanical performance of bonded structures. Experimental research work is presented examining the potential of frequency response techniques for the detection of debonding in composite-to-composite external patch repairs. Natural frequencies were found to decrease over a discrete frequency range as the debond size increased; confirming that such features could be used to both detect and characterise damage. The effectiveness of the frequency response technique was then confirmed for composite patch and scarf repair specimens for free-free and fixed-fixed boundary conditions. Finally, the viability of the frequency response technique was assessed for a scarf repair of a real aircraft component, where it was found that structural damping limited the <b>maximum</b> <b>useable</b> <b>frequency.</b> The feasibility of CVM technique for the inspection of co-cured stiffener-skin aircraft structures was explored. The creation of sensor cavities with tapered mandrels was found to significantly alter the microstructure of the stiffener, including crimping and waviness of fibres and resin-rich zones between plies. Representative stiffened-skin structure with two sensor cavity configurations (parallel and perpendicular to the stiffener direction) was tested to failure in tension and compression. While tensile failure strength was significantly reduced for both configurations (up to 25 %), no appreciable differences in compression properties were found. Two potential sensor cavity configurations were investigated for the extension of the CVM technique to pre-cured and co-bonded scarf repair schemes. The creation of radial and circumferential CVM sensor cavities was found to significantly alter the microstructure of the adhesive bond-line and the architecture of the repair material {{in the case of the}} co-bonded repair. These alterations changed the failure mode and reduced the tensile failure strength of the repair. A fibre straightening mechanism responsible for progressive failure (specific to co-bonded repairs with circumferential cavities) was identified, and subsequently supported with acoustic emission testing and numerical analysis. While fatigue performance was generally reduced by the presence of CVM cavities, the circumferential cavities appeared to retard crack progression, reducing sensitivity to the accumulation of fatigue damage. These outcomes have brought forward the implementation of SHM in bonded composite structures, which has great potential to improve the operating efficiency of next generation aircraft...|$|R

In this paper, we study the energy efficiency of correlation aware data aggregation trees under various sensor network conditions and the tradeoffs involved in using them. The following two related questions are specifically investigated in the study: (i) Is there any practical limit on the achievable improvement in energy efficiency in adopting a correlation aware aggregation structure {{as opposed to a}} correlation unaware structure? (ii) Is there a practical <b>maximum</b> <b>useable</b> delay bound that can deliver the maximum achievable improvement? In answering the above questions, we present comprehensive simulation results and draw inferences based on the results. We also conclude two rather surprising results that the energy improvement in using correlation aware aggregation is not significant under many network scenarios, and the <b>maximum</b> <b>useable</b> delay bound is not large compared with the delay along the maximum length shortest-path in the default shortest path tree.

40|$|International audienceModal {{overlap in}} a {{reverberation}} chamber (RC) involves, strictly speaking, {{an infinite number}} of modes in the field statistics. The degree of overmodedness of an RC is often assessed by introducing an arbitrary reference bandwidth in which a number of overlapping modes is computed. We introduce a statistical model of the field in which the number of modes is rigorously finite. The model is chosen such that the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) of the field can be assessed. The number of DOF is assessed by considering the degree of homogeneity of the average power received by a linearly polarized antenna. It is considered that a statistical approach requires at least a single degree of freedom.

In particular, it was shown that, below or close to the lowest <b>useable</b> <b>frequency</b> (LUF), a generally admitted criterion proposed by the International Standard IEC 61000 - 4 - 21 to evaluate the uniformity of the field distribution is valid in chaotic RCs while not in conventional regular RCs. Indeed, the EM field in chaotic RCs display universal statistical features which cannot be obtained in conventional RCs at low frequency. In chaotic RCs, we propose to use the universality of field statistics to evaluate a confidence interval based on the theoretical distribution of the electric field deduced from the sole knowledge of the modal overlap...|$|R

40|$|Extensive {{sequences}} of flood basalts dominate the northwest European Atlantic margin. The basalt flows absorb and scatter the higher frequencies present in any source wavelet through intrinsic and apparent seismic attenuation. Successful sub-basalt imaging therefore tends {{to focus on}} the generation of low frequencies in acquisition and retention in processing. Conversely, the Rosebank discovery in the Faroe-Shetland Basin of oil bearing sequences interbedded within the Basalt illustrates that high frequencies need to be recovered in order to delineate subtle stratigraphic plays. For this we require broad bandwidth, a robust approach to signal to noise improvement and accurate knowledge of the seismic quality factor (Q) to compensate for locally strong attenuation effects. We show that the required bandwidth can be obtained from conventionally acquired seismic data through the use of low and high frequency boosting operators and application of a horizon consistent Q field. The latter is derived using the pre-stack Q-inversion (PSQI) method to determine effective Q in defined intervals from the data itself. Through a combination of both techniques a substantial uplift in resolution is demonstrated for the highly prospective intra-basalt units with <b>useable</b> <b>frequencies</b> up to 50 Hz. ...|$|R
