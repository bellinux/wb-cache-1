40|$|Microstructured or holey {{optical fibres}} are a novel class of fibres that have {{attracted}} much interest recently {{because they can}} be tailored to have properties (dispersion, nonlinearity, mode size) very different from conventional fibres. These structures can consist exclusively of air holes arranged around a solid core region in a uniform background. Since such fibres do not have any raised index regions, they cannot support true bound modes. They can, however, possess leaky modes where the light is trapped within a region surrounded by air holes. Such modes suffer confinement losses due to energy leakage between and through the holes. The <b>confinement</b> <b>loss</b> is given by the imaginary part of the complex effective mode index n eff.
