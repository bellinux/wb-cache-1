5000|$|Clapton {{recorded}} the acoustic version of [...] "Layla" [...] on a C.F. Martin & Co. steel-string acoustic guitar in OOO-42 style from 1939 which was hand built in Nazareth, Pennsylvania (No. OOO-42/73234). Clapton called this guitar {{one of the}} finest instruments he has ever used and called its sound [...] "incredible". The auction house Christie's noted, [...] "the guitar {{became one of the most}} enduring images of recent music history" [...] being a part of the Unplugged album cover. Christie's expert for the musical department Kerry Keane called the instrument [...] "in the hands of Eric <b>Capton</b> singly responsible for the repolarization of playing acoustic guitar today". When Keane played the guitar, he also remarked an [...] "amazing" [...] sound as the acoustic guitar seems to have a [...] "wonderfully balanced tone is loud and sweet at the same time with an incredible bass note." [...] The vintage instrument was estimated to sell between $60,000 to $80,000 but was in the end sold for $791,500.|$|E
5000|$|The Everleigh sisters spared {{no expense}} in their redecoration of their brothel which they named the Everleigh Club. A dozen parlors were {{located on the}} first floor. Each parlor {{consisted}} of a certain theme such as : the Silver Parlor, the Gold Parlor, the Rose Parlor, or the Japanese Throne Room—all of which appealed to the varying groups of clientele the club received. The upstairs of the Everleigh Club held the private bedrooms where clientele could enjoy a more personal encounter with the women of his choosing alongside luxurious divans, damask chairs, gilt bathtubs and warbling canaries. As luxurious, the dining room's design emulated a private Pullman railroad passenger car with the corresponding ornate gold and mahogany trimmings. The menu featured only the finest entrees such as: duck, caviar, lobster, deviled crab, fried oysters, goose <b>capton,</b> and an excellent selection of wine. It is due to all these extravagant amenities the Everleigh Club was dubbed [...] "probably the most famous and luxurious house of prostitution in the country" [...] by the Chicago Vice Commission. The Everleigh quickly gained a reputation as an upscale gentlemen's club, {{so much so that}} the Everleigh sisters were forced to turn away prospective clients even on opening day on February 1, 1900. The club's extensive popularity afforded Minna and Ada the opportunity to select their clientele. Only those men deemed suitable by Minna and Ada gained admittance into the Everleigh Club. The Everleigh sisters deemed a prospective client [...] "worthy" [...] to be admitted into the club if: the prospective client provided a letter of recommendation from an existing member, an engraved card, or through a formal introduction by Minna or Ada. These standards made the club extremely exclusive, indulging the desires of only the wealthy and influential men. Author Karen Abbott wrote, [...] "The cachet of being able to go there, just because they turned down so many people. It became an exclusive badge of honor just to be admitted." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} year the CMS {{experiment}} has constructed and integrated the largest ever build full Silicon Strip Tracker. The CMS Tracker collaboration set up a unique scheme of quality control to ensure the necessary high quality {{of all of the}} 15, 148 modules and their super structures. The applied scheme of quality control revealed several problems, which escaped the initial R&D phase, ranging from corrosion effects on the silicon, <b>capton</b> and via problems on the front end hybrids up to aging conductive glue connections. An overview of the construction and qualification experience is given, discussing the major steps which result in the unique experimental device, which the CMS Tracker is currently commissioning...|$|E
40|$|EXSTASE is a {{spin-off}} {{project from}} the MUPUS (Rosetta Lander) thermal probe, both funded by DLR. The thermal probe {{will be tested}} in various environments and fields, e. g. in snow research, agriculture, permafrost, monitoring waste deposits and the heat released by decomposition, ground truth for remote sensing etc. The probe is a glass-fibre tube of 1 cm diamter, about 32 cm long and carries of 16 sensors for measuring temperature profiles. Each of the sensors can also be heated for in situ measurements of the thermal conductivity of the penetrated layers. All necessary connection and the sensors itself are printed on a <b>capton</b> foil which is rolled and glued to the inner wall of the tube. This design results in the significant advantage that the measurements can be done in-situ - noch excavation of material is required to do the measurements. Recently, {{the development of the}} field electronic was finished and now the heating option - which is necessary to do the thermal conductivity measurements - is available and first test measurements have been done. Preliminary results of these tests and the new design of the probe are shown...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present the Front End Electronics for the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) of the ALICE experiment. The system, which {{consists}} of about 570000 channels, is based on two basic units: (a) an analogue ASIC (PASA) that incorporates the shaping-amplifier circuits for 16 channels; (b) a mixed-signal ASIC (ALTRO) that integrates 16 channels, each consisting of a 10 -bit 25 -MSPS ADC, the baseline subtraction, tail cancellation filter, zero suppression and multi-event buffer. The complete readout chain is contained in Front End Cards (FEC), with 128 channels each, connected to the detector by means of <b>capton</b> cables. A number of FECs (up to 25) are controlled by a Readout Control Unit (RCU), which interfaces the FECs to the Data Acquisition (DAQ), the Trigger, and the Detector Control System (DCS). A fraction of the final electronics (1024 channels) has been characterized in a test that incorporates a prototype of the ALICE TPC {{as well as many}} other components of the final set-up. The tests show that the system meets all design requirements. Originally conceived and optimized for the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) of the ALICE experiment, its architecture and programmability make this system suitable for the readout of a wider class of detectors.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the four fungal and two bacterial bioagents were evaluated for the bicontrol efficacy and ability to induce systemic resistance against Fusarium udum causing wilt of pigeonpea which is posing {{a serious threat to}} pigeonpea growing regions of India. Among the six isolates, maximum mycelial inhibition was noticed in Trichoderma harzianum (Th- R) as compared to other biocontrol agents. Among contact fungicides, maximum inhibition (> 75 %) of mycelium was recorded in Mancozeb and <b>capton</b> at 0. 20 and 0. 3 % concentrations. More than 90 % inhibition was recorded among the systemic fungicides at all the all the concentrations except thiophanate methyl which recorded 53. 67 % inhibition at 0. 05 % concentration. Among different treatment combinations of biocontrol agents, the highest vigour index was recorded in P. fluorescense (RP- 46) + P. putida (RP- 56) treated seeds in both the cultivars (Moderately resistant and susceptible). The level of expression of defense related enzymes (PO, PPO & PAL) was more in moderately resistant cultivar(BSMR- 736) rather than susceptible one(ICP- 2376). In glass house experiment seeds treated with P. flourescens (RP- 46) + P. putida (RP- 56) recorded least wilt incidence as compared to other treatments. In both Kharif seasons of 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15 recorded significantly lowest wilt incidence and highest yield in soil drenching with 0. 2 % Carbendazim fungicide. Among the biocontrol agents, seed treatment @ 4 g / kg seeds + soil application of PGPR (P. flourescens & P. putida) consortium @ 25 kg/ ha in FYM @ 50 kg/ ha, recorded least wilt incidence and highest yield...|$|E
